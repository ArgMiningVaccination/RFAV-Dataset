She always made suggestions to improve processes and service and moved up through the ranks to her current position of Purchasing Assistant. As a hard - working, loyal and dedicated Station staff member, Kathy provided outstanding purchasing and administrative support to the agency's research staff in a courteous and professional manner. She was quick to learn and adapt to agency modernization and the agency's transformation to the completely automated State - wide accounting system CORE -CT. Ms. Soleski was polite and courteous with co-workers and state residents who called upon the Station for assistance or information. Her dedication to her responsibilities and loyalty to the Experiment Station along with her cheerful personality are qualities that will leave a void and certainly be missed. A true public servant and ambassador for the Expe riment Station and the State of Connecticut, for twenty -eight years, we honor Ms. Kathryn Soleski and her many important contributions on the occasion of her retirement. Michael C. Thomas Michael Thomas joined the staff of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in April 1999 as a Research Assistant II in the Department of Entomology where he assisted Dr. Chris Maier in studies on forest and apple orchard insect pests. A year later he was promoted to Research Technician I, and transferred to the Department of Soil & Water, (now the Department of Environmental Sciences and Center for Vector Biology & Zoonotic Diseases) where he assisted Dr. Theodore Andreadis and later Dr. Philip Armstrong in the statewide Mosquito/ Arbovirus Surveillance Program a nd assisted in studies on the ecology of mosquitoes and epidemiology of mosquito- borne diseases. In 2004, he was promoted to Research Technician II. An outstanding ornithologist and field naturalist with taxonomic expertise in local insect fauna, most nota bly dragonflies and robber flies, Michael quickly mastered the identification of mosquitoes, and over the years became an expert on mosquito ecology and natural history throughout the region. This cu lminated in publication of the Identification Guide to the Mosquitoes of Connecticut , which he co -authored with Dr. Andreadis and Mr. John Shepard. For eighteen years, Michael made immeasurable contributions to the Station's mosquito research and surveillance programs, identifying and processing mosquitoes for virus isolation, maintaining mosquito and animal colonies, conducting bioassays with potential biological control agents and establishing the Station's reference collection of local mosquito species. In the field, Michael routinely traversed the State uncovering breeding sites for native and invasive species, setting specialized traps and collecting mosquitoes in variety habitats across the entire spectrum, from inner urban cities and junk yards to remote woodland swamps. In addition to maintaining equipment, each summer he would supervise the training of seasonal research assistants in mosquito trapping in the field. Ever resourceful, Michael would enthusiastically take on new tasks, never hesitate to work beyond normal hours and ma ke adjustments to meet the demands of a project. He would The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 10 always make excellent suggestions to improve the efficiency and lend his expertise in designing and implementing research projects in the field. An outstanding nature photographer with exceptional s kill in graphic arts, Michael would regularly prepare maps, figures and photographs for scientific publications and ably served as the Station's official photographer at all events, including Plant Science Day. Always polite, courteous and cooperative, wit h visitors, Station staff, and collaborators, Michael is the embodiment of a true professional in every sense of the word. Whereas, for eighteen years, Michael Thomas has ably served The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station and citizens of Connectic ut. His research truly exemplifies the motto of the Experiment Station: \"Putting Science to Work for Society\". We honor Michael and his contributions on his retirement. Michael P. Vasil Michael Vasil joined the staff of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station as a Summer Worker in the Department of Entomology in 1992 studying the predation of gypsy moths for Dr. Ronald Weseloh. He was later hired in November as an Agricultural Research Assistant II to assist Dr. John F. Anderson with his studie s on the epidemiology of Lyme disease and ticks. Initially, he learned to identify ticks sent in by the public and to test ticks for Borrelia burgdorferi by culture and the polymerase chain reaction. Two years later, he was promoted to Agricultural Research Assistant III, and in 1996, he was promoted to Agricultural Technician I. In 1999, he was promoted to Agricultural Research Technician II. Years later he was transferred to the Department of Environmental Sciences and Center for Vector Biology & Zoonotic Diseases. An exceptional outdoorsman, who grew up enjoying the woods, pastures, woodland and coastal swamps, and waters of Connecticut and who graduated with a biology degree from Southern Connecticut State University, Michael learned to collect mosquitoe s and ticks, and to trap mammals and birds for Dr. Anderson's studies on the natural history of biting arthropods and the epidemiology of human and animal viruses and pathogens. For twenty -five years, Michael made important contributions to the Station's tick and mosquito research and testing programs. He maintained laboratory animals and established mosquito, tick, and bed bug colonies. Michael trapped arthropod vectors, birds and mammals from Stonington to Greenwich. Birds were collected in the field in mist nets early in morning, identified, ticks removed, and blood samples taken before being released back into the wild. Michael would set up his card table in the field with microscope, forceps, syringes, collecting tubes with labels, ice chest, anesthesi a, notebook, and chair, and upon retrieving captured rodents, specimens would be examined for ticks, bled, ear -tagged, and returned to the field. Various types of mosquito traps, some containing laboratory animals, were placed in the field at various heigh ts from subterranean into the canopy of trees. During his Station career, Michael worked in many \"hot spots\" in Connecticut for Lyme disease, human babesiosis, eastern equine encephalomyelitis, and West Nile virus disease, and in the BSL -2 and BSL -3 contai nment laboratories. He conducted animal experiments with the causative agents of many of these human diseases as well as Powassan encephalitis virus. In relatively recent years, Michael conducted dozens of experiments testing attractants and repellents of bed bugs. He maintained and in some cases, built equipment for field and laboratory studies. Michael enthusiastically took on new tasks, never hesitated to work beyond normal hours, including weekends, and often made adjustments to complete assignments. He often made excellent suggestions to improve the efficiency of projects and provided his expertise in designing and implementing research projects. In the past two years, Michael assisted Dr. Theodore Andreadis and Dr. Philip Armstrong in raising and ident ifying native and exotic container -breeding mosquitoes associated with the transmission of viruses. Always polite, courteous, cooperative, and professional with citizens, Station staff, and collaborators, and particularly in relatively recent years with Bedoukian Research in 11 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Danbury, CT, Michael is the embodiment of a true professional in every sense of the word. Whereas, for twenty -five years, Michael P. Vasil has ably served The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station and citizens of Connecticut through his research in the outdoors and laboratory, and whereas his daily efforts truly exemplify the motto of the Experiment Station: \"Putting Science to Work for Society ,\" we honor Michael and his numerous contributions on his retirement.

The recipient is selected by the Connecticut Agricultural Information Council. Proclamation from Governor Dannel P. Malloy: Kasheta Farms had its beginnings in 1905, when Peter and Mary Kasheta purchased a long, narrow parcel of land that extended from the Connecticut River to the Town Center in South Windsor . The primary crop grown at that time was broadleaf tobacco, but it was also a complete family farm selling milk, cheese, butter, eggs, and fresh grown fruits and vegetables. Operation of the farm w as subsequently taken over by Walter Kasheta along with his son, Edward W. Kasheta, Sr . In 1955, the tobacco industry in the Connecticut River Valley was dealt a severe blow due to the invention of a process to produce sheet tobacco for use as binders and wrappers for cigars . The federal government provided assistance to farmers through funding of the Connecticut - Massachusetts Tobacco Co -Op and purchased all the unsold tobacco produced in the Valley so farmers could survive . Kasheta Farms consequently start ed growing 150 acres of potatoes until that market fell into decline in the 1960s . Kasheta Farms further diversified by growing market vegetables, including tomatoes, sweet corn, peppers, and squash all while still producing tobacco. Ed Kasheta, Jr. then a dded grain corn marketed as a high moisture corn crop and sold it for chicken feed to K & L Feed Co. in North Franklin, CT until that mill closed. Along the way, pumpkins, gourds, and giant pumpkins were added to the list of products that were sold to loca l farm stands and retailers. Through the years, Ed Sr.'s other sons joined the family business . Donald T. Kasheta has been growing and delivering sod turf and currently oversees a commercial landscape maintenance service. David A. Kasheta runs the power equipment store sales, service, and parts. All three brothers and Dad work together to keep the farm running smoothly. Kasheta Farms, Inc. is currently producing approximately 400 acres of grain corn, 100 acres of sod, 20 acres of broadleaf tobacco, and 20 a cres of pumpkins and gourds. As Governor, I am pleased to join The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station and the Connecticut Agricultural Information Council in presenting this Century Farm Award to Kasheta Farms, who is most deserving of this honor. After the presentation of the Century Farm Award, Barbara Yaeger , President of the Experiment Station Associates, gave a few remarks and invited all in the audience to join the Associates. Plant Science Day 201 7 was a very big success that was enjoyed by a record number of visitors - due to the hard work of the entire Station staff.

My wife and I were avid gardeners. Our \u00be acre lot in West Simsbury was landscaped and about 80% planted by us with a wide variety of perennials, annuals, shrubs, trees and roses. I raised over 100 hybrid tea roses which I exhibited, quite successfully, at the Pond House as a member of the CT Rose Society. We are indebted to Rose for her identification and advice for eliminating and controlling pests and plant diseases over the years. My awards for prize roses would not have been possible without her advice. Most recently, just before we sold our home of 45 years, we decided to hire a contractor to plant an extensive lawn for us. We followed his watering and fertilizing instructions carefully. However, when the lawn was coming up, we noticed that it had a mixture of taller and very different grass throughout. I brought samples of this grass in for Rose to examine and identify. She identified them as an invasive grass: Quack Grass. She also gave me instructions on how I could eliminate this grass. However, the grass was so extensive and invasive, that I finally asked the contractor to replant the lawn or give me a refund. He refused. I finally had to resort to filing a lawsuit against the contractor. I used Rose's professional identification in my claim and I was able to win a judgement against the contractor in Small Claims Cour t and I was able to collect almost half of what I had paid for the work. Without her professional assistance, I would not have been able to obtain that judgement. My wife and I will be forever thankful for Rose Hiskes and her help over the years.\" On July 14, 2017, Jenny Byers, Edgerton Park Grounds Committee, wrote the following to Yonghao Li. \"Thank you, Dr. Li!! Your observations are extremely helpful, and we are very grateful for your expert help. We 're lucky to have you, and the Ag. Station, as near a nd knowledgeable neighbors! \" On August 2, 2017, Alan Paskewich wrote the following about Lindsay Patrick. \"Your presentation was the best to date I've heard about the subject of pruning! Providing well defined bold graphic illustrations with a style and a smile that made it easy to follow. What I'm thinking is that your educational talent would be well utilized in other venues as well (not that you may already be busy with CAES) but I'm thinking of the Tree Warden's Association (which does give workshops a ffiliated with CAES) and another area would be the UConn Natural Resources department in West H artford that sponsors simil ar program edu cation. Just a thought Lindsay. Oh yeh, I almost forgot to ask you my original request to help me find the handouts for pruning techniques as you spoke to and also the Apple tree pruning guide...I have a wild apple t ree propagated from a Baldwin rootstock that I cut down 5 years ago and has grown into a fully well proportioned fruiting many clusters to date! I called the AG station in NY close to Cornell...and the scientist there told me it would be difficult to determine what variety it might be...I was hoping it was genetic related to the original stock from the Cauca sus M ountains region.\" On September 6, 2017, Jasmine Wolf, conference organizer, \"Chronic Lyme Disease: Restoring Balance in the Body,\" wrote the following to Jeffrey Ward. \"Thank you so much for presenting at our Lyme Disease Conference year after year. As you know, Charlotte and I believe the information you share is extremely valuable to protect the health of people & pets and perhaps the most underused method of prevention of tick -borne illness. Charlotte and I (and Connecticut) are very lucky to have you.\" On September 22, 2017, Inge borg Venus, President, Federated Garden Clubs of Connecticut, wrote the following to Kirby Stafford. \"On behalf of The Federated Garden Clubs of Connecticut, Inc., I would like to extend our appreciation to you for having addressed our over sixty Connecticut G arden Club Presidents The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 34 and 35 Board member s on September 20, 2017 at Jones Auditorium. Your comments were most illuminating and well received. Thank you again for being available on such short notice.\" On September 22, 2017, Gloria Rothfeld Stelkovis wrote the following about Gale Ridge. \" My reason for writing to you today is to relate to you our experience with Dr. Gale Ridge at the C T Agricultural Experiment Station. We came to see Dr. Ridge with some samples of what we thought were bugs, given to us by our daughter. She claims that these bugs have infested her body, (skin, eyes, etc.). Dr. Ridge checked these samples and determined that there were no bugs involved. She then patiently sat down with my husband and I and explained about a condition tho ught to be caused by long term use of antibiotics, among other causes. Our daughter has chronic Lyme disease and has been on antibiotics for long periods of time. She explained about small thread neuropathy and suggested that Robin consult with Dr. Oakland er at Harvard Medical School and MGH. She then repeated this information in a conference call with our daughter. I cannot think of anyone who has been so generously giving of her knowledge, patience and expertise in all of my almost 90 years of living! My daughter is not the easiest person to convince of something and evidently this condition has built in resistance. We were besides ourselves with confusion, worry, and anxiety about Robin and the horror she is going through. I do not know if she will come a round to Dr. Ridge 's view and at least consult with the neurologist suggested, but Dr. Ridge has shown us a path to follow. She did this with the most extraordinary patience, kindness and thoughtfulness. At this point the ball is in Robin 's court. The whol e family is behind her with whatever support she needs. I just wanted you to know what an incredible face you present to your community with this scientist and to thank you for having the foresight to have her represent your organization to the public.\" On October 3, 2017, Mrs. Quinn Wade wrote the following about Gale Ridge and Katherine Dugas . \"I am writing in regards to bed bugs. My husband and I found a bug in our home several days ago that looked like a bed bug. Because there is so much alarm in regar ds to these bugs I began to immediately research information on the computer. In my search I spoke to at least 10 people and one person who finally gave me the name of Dr. Gale E. Ridge, Entomologist. After careful research it was my understanding that if you had a concern of a bug you should seek professional information on the bug. Dr. Gale Ridge calmed my fears and after much discussion with her on these bugs I left more relaxed and certainly more informed. Ms. Katherine Dugas who is a lovely young woman is the first person we encountered who believed what I had brought into their lab was a bed bug, but she hurriedly sought the Dr. out for confirmation. Since our meeting I did all the Dr. suggested to keep ourselves feeling more secure in our environment and that all the steps we received from the Dr.'s CCABB informational would help us step by step. We called in the canine group of Ms. Jill Mayer and we are satisfied with the results. I called Dr. Ridge yesterday October 2, 2017 to advise the canine was on his way. I also called her after the evaluation of the results. She was kind enough to ask me to call her once the canine left and I had the results. What a wonderfully kind, patient, informed person you have on staff, Dr. Ridge. She spent considerable t ime with me and my husband to calm our fears and to direct us in our steps of CCABB. We thank Katherine for being the first person we encountered when we arrived at 123 Huntington Street. When I told her our immediate concern she said \"you have come to the right place.\" Thank you Katherine. Dr. Ridge we thank you for all of your help. We are so very thankful that you were there when we most needed you to calm us and most of all to inform us.\" On October 11, 2017, Melinda K. Plaisier, Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food & Drug Administration, wrote the following to Jason White. \" On behalf of the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), I would like to extend our sincere congratulations to the Connectic ut Agricultural Experiment Station for achieving International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 17025 accreditation.

Activities within each area are often complimentary. A breakdown of sample s based on submitting agenc y is shown below. Source of Sample Numbers of samples analyzed Department of Agriculture 117 Department of Consumer Protection 269 Department of Energy and Environmental Protection 70 FDA, Health Depts., Cities/Towns, Misc. Foundations 156 Proficiency Test Samples 30 University Research Collaborators 856 CAES Departments 2100 Grand Total 3,598 I. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Analyses in the Department of Analytical Chemistry are conducted on a wide range of sample type s submitted by other state and federal agencies, municipalities, law enforcement , non- profit groups, businesses, university collaborators, and other D epartments at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES). This list is not intended to be all -inclusive. 1. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The Department of Analytical Chemistry has two longstanding programs with the CT Department of Agriculture (DoAg) involving the chemical analysis of commercial feed and fertilizer products. a. Animal Feeds : Analyst : John Ranciato , Nubia Zuverza -Mena, Brian Eitzer Goal : To assure products are in compliance with stated label guarantees and that levels of aflatoxins, if present, are below regulatory limits . Summary : This was one of the primary analyses of the Station in the late 1890s. Products for household pets and commercial agricultural operations are collected by inspectors from DoAg. Analytical results are reported to DoAg, who in turn report findings to the product dealer and/or manufacturer and conduct regulatory response as required. In addition, data are reported to the FDA through an online data exchange platform called eLEXNET . Results : From July 1, 201 7 to June 30, 2018, we received and completed analysis of 52 feed samples. Twenty -three of t hese samples were analyzed for protein, fat, moisture, fiber, select micronutrients and aflatoxins . Samples deficient in one or more analytes (determined according to the investigational allowances outlined in the Offic ial Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 7 (30%). Specifically , 2 (8.7%) were deficient in protein; 3 (13.0%) were deficient in fat and 3 (13.0%) contained an excess of fiber. Of the samples analyzed for micronutrients, 5 (22%) were found to be unsatisfactory in one or more guaranteed nutrient value. Analytical findin gs are turned over to CT DoAg for regulatory response . Joint funding with the DoAg has been acquired from the 85 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 FDA to facilitate inclusion in the Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards (AFRPS); this 5 -year cooperative agreement has enabled the Department to bring aflatoxin analysis in animal feeds by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectroscopy (LC -HRMS) under the scope of ISO accreditation effective February 2018. This reporting period, 29 samples were analyzed by methods for aflatoxin extract ion and quantitation (by LC -HRMS) in corn- based feed as part of the AFRPS. All samples but one were officially logged out with no aflatoxins detected; the final sample had Aflatoxin B1 at 1.06 \u00b5g/Kg (below the tolerance of 20 \u00b5g/Kg total aflatoxin). b. Fertilizers : Analysts : John Ranciato Goal : To assure products are in compliance with stated label guarantees. Summary : This was one of the primary analyses of the Station in 1875. Products from residential and commercial agricultural operations are collected by DoAg inspectors. Analytical results are reported to DoAg, who in turn reports findings to the product dealer and product manufacturer and takes regulatory response as needed . Results : From July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, we received and completed analysis of 41 samples for macronutrients, such as nitrogen, available phosphoric acid, and potash, and for micronutrients, including but not limited to boron, sulfur, cobalt, magnesium, and iron. Samples deficient in one or more analytes (determined according to the in vestigational allowances outlined in the Official Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 26 (63%). Analytical findings are turned over to the CT Department of Agriculture for regulatory action . c. Analysis of seaweed samples : Analysts : Terri Arsenault, Craig Musante, Michael Ammirata, Brian Eitzer Goal : To assess potential contamination of seaweed prior to release for sale. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 86 Summary : A newer program with the CT DoAg Bureau of Aquaculture involves the chemical and microbial analysis of seaweed being grown commercially in CT for sale to restaurants. The CAES Department of Analytical Chemistry conducts the chemical analysis; the microbial analysis happens at the Department of Public Health ( DPH) Laboratory Environmental Microbiology Section. During the current reporting period, 31 samples were received for analysis of moisture content, pesticides by both liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC -MS; GC - as polychlor by GC with electron capture detection (GC -ECD) , and select heavy metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP -MS). Results are reported to DoAg Aquaculture staff for a decision on regulatory action. All samples analyz ed were judged suitable for sale on the basis of chemical analysis results. 2. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , FOOD AND STANDARDS DIVISION Analyses conducted on food and consumer product samples submitted by the CT Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) are important to public safety. The results of these analyses are reported quickly and can lead to the recall of products that have levels of chemical residues, heavy metals, fungi/mold, or fecal contamination that a re deemed unacceptable by DCP . If products are imported into CT from other states or countries, the US Food and Drug Administration leads the regulatory response. a. Pesticide residues in food : Analysts : Walter Krol, Brian Eitzer , Michael Ammirata, T erri Arsenault, and Kitty Prapayotin- Riveros Summary : As part of the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) , we determine concentrations of pesticides and total arsenic in fresh and processed foods from local, domestic, and imported sources offered for sale in CT and assure compliance with established tolerances. MFRPS survey samples are collected by DCP Inspectors and results are published in periodic Station Bulletin s available by mail and at www.ct.gov/caes . From July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, a total of 111 samples of food were analyzed for pesticide residues. Of the 111 samples analyzed, 48 (43.2%) contained a total of 120 residues. Of these 48 samples, there was 1 sample that contained a total of 4 violative residues. There were 55 different pesticide active ingredients found at an average concentration of 0.452 \u00b5g/Kg, and the average number of pesticide residues 87 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 per sample containing residues was 2.4. During the same time frame, there were 21 fresh and processed food samples analyzed for total arsenic; none of these were found to be violative. With US FDA funding and support, has received and maintained ISO/IEC 17025 Accreditation from the American Association for Laboratory Accreditati on (A2LA) for this program. Impact: The Department's MFRPS s erves as the sole surveillance and monitoring effort in the state, assuring that the food supply within CT is safe and free from chemical and heavy metal contamination . b. Miscellaneous samples : Analyst : John Ranciato , Brian Eitzer Summary : From July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, 54 consumer complaint samples were submitted by CT DCP for analysis, including foreign material identification, fecal content determination, product adulteration or tamperi ng, and off taste . For some samples, we rely on the expertise in other CAES D epartments, including Plant Pathology and Ecology, Entomology, and Forestry and Horticulture. 3. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , LIQUOR CONTROL DIVISION a. Beverages/products for ethanol content : Analyst : Terri Arsenault Goal : To provide percent ethanol content for label registration and taxation purposes. Summary : We analyzed 2 products such as beers, wines, and liquors for ethanol content. Results were submitted to DCP in support of product label registration. b. Beverage authenticity: Analyst : Terri Arsenault , Brian Eitzer Goal : To determine if products offered to customers at CT establishments are authentic as to brand. Summary : Eleven alcoholic products were e xamined for authenticity; 5 samples were found to not match the gas chromatographic or elemental profile of comparison authentic samples. These results are returned to the DCP Division of Liquor Control, who determine appropriate regulatory action. A conductivity meter that was supplied to Liquor Control inspectors for field determination of vodka authenticity continues to be successfully used. Elemental profile as determined by inductively coupled plasma with mass spectrometry (ICP -MS) or optical emission spectroscopy (ICP -OES) is now also used during adulteration investigations. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 88 4. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (DEEP), WASTE MANAGEMENT BUREAU a. Analysis of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) : Analysts : Michael Ammirata, Terri Arsenault Goals : To determine the extent of polychlorinate d biphenyl (PCB) contamination in submitted samples, with matrices including soil, water, oil, sediments, and surface wipes. Summary : From July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, 55 samples were analyzed from pre -existing sites or new locations in CT. Sample collection is performed by the DEEP PCB Enforcement Unit as part of mandatory long- term monitoring of these areas. A number of samples were submitted due to downed telephone poles in residual areas stemming from the tornadoes in May 2018. The findings are reported to DEEP for assessment of continued regulatory compliance or to establish remediation criteria. In addition, two proficiency tests were successfully completed as part of this program. b. Analysis of pe sticides : Analysts : Brian Eitzer, Terri Arsenault Goals : To ascertain pesticide concentration associated with misapplication or drift in support of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Additional samples are analyzed in support of DEEP surface and groundwater monitoring programs. Subm itted sample m atrices include soil, water, oil , sediments, tank mixes , and surface wipes. By request, select samples can be analyzed for glyphosate using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA ). Summary : From July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, 15 samples were analyzed under this program. Impact : The analysis of samples collected from surveillance programs for soil, surface/groundwater and sediments, as well as those that are part of active misapplication investigations, enable DEEP to enforce curr ent state and federal regulations on pesticides and to promote overall environmental and public health. 5. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF MUNICIPAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES a. Analysis of samples for FDA Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) : Analysts : Craig Musant e, Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer, Christina Robb, Walter Krol, Kitt y P.- Riveros, John Ranciato, Jason C. White Summary : The Department of Analytical Chemistry continues its work with the FDA as part of the Food Emergency Response Network Chemistry Cooperative Agreement Program (FERN cCAP). This program enables research and analyses on contaminants in food such as pesticides, poisons, toxins, and heavy metals . Staff participated in an FDA surveillance assignment involving the analysis of 100 samples of imported spices, herbs, and flours; 89 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 results were reported to FDA through eLEXNET. Staff scientists are currently participating in an active surveillance assignment of rice -based baby foods within CT; five separate analytical platforms are being used to screen food for poisons, toxins, pesticides, heavy metals , and inorganic arsenic species. The Department participated in several FDA and USDA FSIS profi ciency tests an d challenge exercises. Dr. Christina Robb has continued to investigate methods related to the detection of the plant toxins ricin and abrin, including exploring potential use of LC -HRMS for proteomic analysis. Lastly, Brian Eitzer and Ms. Terri Arsenault b oth served as instructors for FDA courses on LC -MS and GC -MS FERN methods, respectively; these training courses are open to FDA staff and other state laboratories. Impact: The Department's participation in FERN has resulted in the acquisition of highly sensitive analytical equipment and significant funding to support staff, including post -doctoral researchers. In addition to being used for FDA work, these resources are also applied to our state programs in a manner that directly benefits the public healt h of CT residents. b. Analysis of samples for municipalities , law enforcement and other groups : Analysts : Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer, Walter Krol, Craig Musante, John Ranciato Summary : From July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, Department staff analyzed several dozen samples for municipalities or other groups. We analyzed foods and other products for heavy metals at the request of the New Haven Health Department and the City of Stamford. In one lead poisoning investigation invo lving a child, submitted samples of turmeric from the child's house, along with compariso n samples from a local retailer, were analyzed by FDA methods. W e detected 0.5% lead and 0.1% chromium in the samples from the house ; the se levels are over one hundred thousand times higher than the background levels in the comparison samp les. Impact: The findings of highly toxic lead and chromium levels in samples of imported household spices assisted city inspectors in their investigation and highlights the importance of FERN equipment and funding to the health of citizens in the state. 6. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF OTHER STATION DEPARTMENTS a. Elemental and Molecular Analysis - Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology : Analyst : Chuanxin Ma, Craig Musante, Roberto De La Torre -Roche, Nubia Zuverza -Mena, Jason C. White Summary : In conjunction with scientists in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology, elemental and molecular analysis of several hundred samples of various crops grown in the presence or absence of nanoscale micronutrient amendments was again conducted. This work is being done under a USDA AFRI NIFA grant focused on this topic; the $480,000 grant began March 1, 2016, and includes co- invest igators at the International Fertilizer Development Center in Muscle Shoals , AL and the University of Texas El Paso. Additional details on this project can be found in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology section of this document. 7. A NALYSIS OF CHECK SAMPLES The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 90 Analysts : Walter Krol, Musante, Michael Ammirata, Nubia Zuverza -Mena Summary : Thirty samples were analyzed during the reporting period as part of a nnual proficiency testing related to our FDA FERN work, F DA ISO Accreditation program (MFRPs), Animal Feed Regulatory Program (AFRPs), as well as performance evaluation samples for our polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) regulatory program. All of these testing regimes serve to ensure accurate and reliable laboratory results. II. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Research projects in the Department of Analytical Chemistry include applied and fundamental investigations . Research is often stimulated by our service work and, in turn, research results often impact service activities. 1. FOOD SAFETY Project 1: Improvement of analytical methods for determination of pesticide residues and heavy metals in food : Investigators : Brian Eitzer , Terri Arsenault, Walter Krol, Christina Robb, Michael Ammirata, Craig Musante, John Ranciato, Jason C. White Summary : We continue to participate in or lead several FDA coordinated research projects. Staff used FDA methods and equipment as part of a First Responder Training Exercise run by the 14th Civil Support Team of the CT National Guard and the FBI Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate out of New Haven. The field training event involved an aircraft at a local airport with a suspected chemical weapon; liquid samples with suspected sodium azide w ere submitted to the laboratory. We used FDA FERN methods to quantify azide in the sample; accurate results were reported out 6 hours after sample receipt. Separate work on the use of high resolution LC - MS and LC -MS/MS platforms for the screening of pesticides, toxins (fungal, plant) , and poisons continued. We a re currently involved in the analysis of rice- based baby food for a range of contaminants, including inorganic arsenic species. We also achieved ISO Accreditation for two separate FDA programs; one focused on human food (MFRPS) and a second focused on anim al feed (AFRPS). Last ly, we have initiated projects investigating the use of LC -HRMS to directly detect the plant proteins abrin and ricin in food. The overall goal of these projects is to develop robust and accurate methods that the FDA could deploy as pa rt of large -scale surveillance programs. Impact: The development and validation of new, more sensitive equipment and analytical techniques will enhance food safety surveillance activities in the state and serve to better protect the public against incidental or intentional adulteration. Project 2: Nanoparticle s in agricultural system s: Investigators : Roberto Nubia White Summary : Nanomaterials (NM) have at least one dimension less than 100 nm (one billionth of a meter), and possess unique physical and chemical properties not observed at the bulk scale . Nanotechnology , which takes advantage of these useful nanoscale properties, has become widely used in numerous sector s, including electronics, health -care, cosmetics, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, an d food processing. Our work in this area is focused on two separate but related topics; the implications of nanomaterial presence (by accident or design) in agricultural syst ems and the use of nanomaterials as agricultural amendments to suppress plant disease. The first project is 91 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 focused on the fate of nanomaterials in agricultural systems. Although nanomaterial use has been widespread and is increasing rapidly, the consensus among the scientific community is that understanding of the fate and effects of nanomaterials in the environment is currently inadequate to accurately assess risk. Research in our laboratory has been focusing on defin ing the impact (physiological and molecular toxicity, accumulation) of NM on food crops, with a focus on the risk posed to humans from exposure to these contaminated plants. Recent work has focused on the potential of these materials to alter the nutritional quality of exposed crops such as p eanut. Additional studies are focusing on how exposure to NM can impact the accumulation and toxicity of other contaminants, including pesticides such as chlordane and imida cloprid, and pharmaceuticals such as tetracycline and carbamazepine. Additional collaborators on this project include colleagues at the University of Massachusetts, Texas A & M University, State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry , the University of Texas El Paso, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, The University of Parma in Italy , Hasselt University in Belgium, Peking University in China, T he Ocean University of China, Zhejiang University, China Agricultural Univer sity, and Nanjing Agricu ltural University . The second project is focused on the use of nanoscale micronutrients to sustainably suppress crop disease and increase yield. Much of this work is happening in conjunction with The Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology. Here, we have shown that nanoscale v ersions of micronutrients such as copper, silica, and sulfur are effective at promoting plant health and stimulating important plant defense pathways that lead to decreased pathogen infection by fungal diseases such as Fusarium and powdery mildew. Impact: Our research has demonstrate d that the toxicity of nanomaterials to crops can be significantly different from that of the corresponding bulk material . Current investigations have also shown under certain exposure scenarios, crop quality can be negatively impacted. In addition, co- exposure to a NM can significantly alter the fate and effects of other organic and elemental contaminants, including additional The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 92 nanomaterials. Alternatively, when used appropriately, nanoscale versions of select micronutrients can suppress crop disease and increase yield. 2. E NVIRONMENTAL MONITORING /REMEDIATION Project 1: Protecting pollinators with economically feasible and environmentally sound ornamental horticulture. Investigators: Brian Eitzer, Kim Stoner (Department of Ent omology), Richard Cowles (Valley Laboratory), Cristi Palmer (Rutgers University) Summary : We are participating in a multi- year multi- institution study to examine pesticide use in ornamental horticulture . One part of this large study is to understand the translocation of pesticides into the pollen and nectar of plants . This is being done by treating the plants with known amounts of five different pesticides and then analyzing the pollen and nectar from the plants for those pesticides . Sampling of these pla nt matrices is very laborious so that only very small amounts of sample can get collected . These small sample amounts then require instrumental methods with great sensitivity . Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry provides this sensitivity. We are currently analyzing the pollen and nectar taken from rhododendron plants during the first two years of this study . Impact : Knowledge of the translocation of pesticides to pollen and nectar can be used to guide farmers in the proper use of pesticides so as to insure not only crop pollination but also protection from pests and pathogens . Project 2: Determining the effects of pesticide exposure on bumble bee microcolonies Investigators : Brian Eitzer, Kim Stoner (Department of Entomology), David Lehman (EPA), Robert Koethe (EPA) Summary : While much has been learned about the effects of pesticides on honey bees, much less is known about their effects on bumble bees . This project is aimed at understanding some of those effects. Pollen is collected at ornamental nurseries and then has its pesticide levels determined using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) so that the baseline level of pesticides in the pollen is known. A portion of the pollen is also characterized by palynology so that the pla nts producing the pollen are also known . After characterization of pesticide content, additional pesticide is then added to the pollen at various dosage levels and then pollen is fed to bumble bee microcolonies. These colonies are then monitored for delete rious effects. After a set time period, the colonies are sacrificed and various compartments of the colony (queen, workers, drones, larva, eggs, nesting, honey pots, fecal material) are analyzed for the pesticide being studied . These data will then help us to understand how the pesticide has impacted these bumble bees . Impact: Knowledge of the effects of pesticides on bumble bees can help us to protect these important native pollinators . PUBLIC OUTREACH Telephone/ Internet Inquiries : We receive approximately 200 calls and emails from the public each year requesting information on issues such as pesticides in food and the environment, as well as heavy metals in food, soils, and consumer products . In some instances, we refer the caller to a more ap propriate CAES department or state agency. 93 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Station Bulletins and Fact Sheets : Station Bulletins are periodically published by our Department . These bulletins are available in printed form and on the CAES website ( www.ct.gov/CAES ). Fact sheets are articles written for the general public regarding topics of timely and widespread interest . These are also available on our website and in printed form. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 94 DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY The Department of Entomology is involved in a variety of service, research, pest surveillance, and plant regulatory activities. The primary service activities are provided through the Insect Information Office (IIO) . Staff in this office answer insect related questions and identify insects and relat ed arthropods for the public, government agencies, growers, and business organizations. All scientists provide information to citizens of Connecticut by answering telephone inquiries, making farm visits, participating in meetings of growers and other groups, and speaking on their research. Most of the research in the Department has a major applied aspect, addressing the integrated management of ticks, pests of field crops, nurseries, and orchards, wood- boring insects, invasive insects, and honey bees and ot her bee pollinators. The Office of the State Entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, created by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1901, is part of the Department of Entomology with responsibility, in part, to ensure our nursery industry is free of plant pests and certify their products for shipment to other states and outside the United States. The Connecticut Green Industry (i.e., nursery, greenhouse, floriculture, sod, Christmas trees) is the largest agricultural business in Co nnecticut. The industry estimates that environmental horticulture generates $1.022 billion gross income supporting 48,000 full and part -time jobs in Connecticut. In conjunction with regulatory activities, Department staff conducts a surveillance program in Connecticut for a variety of established pests and for exotic plant pests, some of regulatory concern, that represent a threat to our green industry, forests, and urban ornamental trees and shrubs. Surveillance for plant pests is performed in partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) program and the U.S. Forest Service. In addition, we participate in a Forest Pest Survey and Outreach Program supported by the USDA. For plant d iseases of regulatory concern, we work closely with the Plant Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. We also conduct forest health surveys and a statewide aerial survey for gypsy moth defoliation (and any defoliation by other insects) and a gypsy moth egg mass survey . The results of our plant and forest surveys for 2017- 2018 may be found later in the Department's research activities along with summaries of our regulatory activities. The Office of the State Entomologi st and the Apiary Inspector also oversee registration of beekeepers and inspection of honey bee colonies for pests and disease. The staff of the Department of Entomology also take a lead in providing extensive outreach a ctivities for the Experiment Station by providing information to both children and adults about the Experiment Station's research at public events and at health and agricultural fairs, such as the Eastern States Exposition (Big E) in Springfield, MA, Celeb rating Agriculture in Woodstock, CT, the Garden Expo in Fairfield, CT, the Yale Peabody Museum's Biodiversity Day, Norwalk- Wilton Tree Festival, and the Connecticut Flower and Garden Show. T he insect information office is located in the renovated Jenkins- Waggoner Laboratory and has a laboratory, office, public reception, and a climate controlled collections room . The Insect Inform ation Office . 95 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Service Activities Insect Information Office Dr. Gale E Ridge works in the New Haven insect information office . Insect identification services date back to nearly the inception of the institution (1875) starting with the first Annual Report of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station published in 1877. The station announced that it was offering to \"identify useful or injurious insects...and to give useful information on the various subjects of Agricultural Science for the use and advantage of the citizens of Connecticut.\" Since 2000, there has been a trend away from traditional communication such as mail and visitors to cell phone and internet . Phone calls remain a primary citizen contact followed by emails. The off ice serves private citizens, pest management professionals, the real estate industry, nurseries, land care businesses, arborists, health departments, other medical professionals, charities, manufacturing, the hospitality industry, schools, colleges, and un iversities, housing authorities, museums, municipalities, libraries, law enforcement, state government, and the media. Between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 the insect information office handled 11,965 requests for information down from the 2017 record of 15,870 inquiries . The decline was because Gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar populations had collapsed . The outbreak was brought under control by the entomopathogenic fungus Entomophaga maimaiga. A cold wet spring in 2018 additionally assisted fungal inoculation of the caterpillars' further suppressing populations . There still remained \"hot spots\" with high activity which prompted calls from affected citizens. Inquiries remained elevated into 2018, in part due to public concern about the insect and pesticide use against it. There were 983 specific calls about pesticides, many concerning treatment against the Gypsy moth. There were 601 categories of inquiries including insects, arachnids, animal, pesticides, insect damage, general entomology, and horticulture. Del usional Infestation (DI) formerly Delusory Parasitosis (DP) cases continued to rise from 189 in 2016, 243 in 2017 to 300 in 2018. These are time consuming psychological cases that encompass multiple phone calls, emails, and visits which often involve medic al professionals . Table 1.

Black legged tick, Ixodes scapularis populations were also high with the insect information office responding to numerous calls and visits during the spring of 2018. Many tick submissions for Lyme disease testing passed though the insect information office. Additionally, mistaken tick identi fications from the public were forwarded to the office for a correction of identification . Woodland cockroach, Parcoblatta pennsylvanica populations increased; there was a brief period of high activity of the four -lined Poecilocapsus lineatus and tarnished Lygus lineolaris plant bugs, during early spring . Ant inquiries remained low . German cockroach inquiries increased indicating populations may be recovering from near extirpat ion in the early 2000s from the use of effective modern baits. During a warm Febr uary the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys inquiries increased as overwintering insects became active in buildings. The cottony scales were active especially cottony maple scale, Pulvinaria innumerabilis which was found on many shrubs and trees . The highest inquiry was human feeding bed bugs (3603) at 31% of total calls, followed in order by pesticides (987), and DI (300) . Termite and fall webworm inquiries were up as well. Inquiries were the second highest on record with 11,965 in 2018 and was higher than normal . This may be an artifact of continued public interest in the Gypsy moth and a continued rise in bed bug inquiries . Of these 53% were natural resources, 43% man and medical issues, 1% undetermined, and 3% food related. Dr. Ridge hosted a number of trainings on bed bugs including national Mattress Recycling Council trainings under the leadership of DEEP as part of a requirement written into the Connecticut mattress recycling law, Act 13 -42. The office continued to lead in public outreach building collaborative relationships and projects with local, state, and federal agencies, particularly health departments to better serve the needs of Connecticut citizens. During the 2017 to 2018 fiscal year, several exotic arthropods were identified by Dr. Ridge. Following is an account of these identifications. The Systematic Entomology Laboratory (SEL) -USDA confirmed identification of Lyctus africanus as a new state record July 3, 2017; Dr. Ridge identified a spider found in China Girl blue holly bought from the East Haven Home Depot by Lindsay Patrick (CAES) for display purposes as a brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus . Trace- back revealed the holly had been grown in Havana, Florida, shipped up to Clinton Nurseries, and then delivered to the Ea st Haven Home Depot for sale July 3, 2017; she identified a male jumping bush cricket, Orocharis saltator , as a new state record September 20, 2017; an identification of the Legurian leafhopper, Eupteryx decemnotata, was confirmed, as the second intercepti on of this insect (the first was in 2009) on September 27, 2017, as well as a new state record for citrus leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella , which was confirmed by the SEL -USDA; and Dr. Ridge received confirmation of her identification of a plant bug Charagochilus longicornis (Miridae) collected on September 21, 2017 from Logees Nursery, Danielson, in Windham County (December 12), a new North American record (this bug is a species found in Southeast Asia). Also in 2017, she identified a minute brown scavenge r beetle, Deinerella sp . (Latridiidae), as a new state record; the skin beetle, Trogoderma simplex , as a new state record; a species of tree hopper, Ophiderma trincta Ball (Membracidae), as a Persimmon psyllid, Trioza diospyri/Baeoalitriozus diosptri, as a new state record. CAPS and Forest Pest Programs: The Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey and Forest Pest Survey and Outreach Project (FPSOP), supported by the USDA -APHIS -PPQ and overseen by State Survey Coordinator Katherine Dugas and Deputy State Entomologist Dr. Victoria L. Smith, are two programs that provide for pest survey and educational outreach on the identification and risks posed by a number of potential invasive insects and plant diseases. With worldwide t rade and travel increasing, we are at an increased risk of foreign plant species, plant diseases, and insect pests being introduced in the U.S. In Connecticut, the CAPS program has largely conducted surveys in nurseries, Christmas tree farms, state parks, and conservation and public lands. In 2018, CAPS is surveying for a number of oak and maple 97 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 insect pests in nurseries and forest landowner properties, as well as for non -native Cerambycids and tortricids in Christmas tree farms. Additional orchard and sola naceous surveys are supported by the Farm Bill. The FPSOP program's main objective is outreach and education about handling the loss of ash from the emerald ash borer and also works with the national Don't Move Firewood Campaign and Connecticut Master Gard eners. The FPOSP also includes a biosurveillance program for exotic beetles related to the emerald ash borer using the native Cerceris wasp. Bird & Butterfly Garden: The Bird and Butterfly Garden is a partnership of the Federated Garden Club of Connecticut , the Spring Glen Garden Club of Hamden, and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Most maintenance and improvements to the garden are done by farm manager Richard Cecarelli and his staff. The garden is open to the public Monday- Friday 8:30 a.m. -4:00 p.m., it is closed on the weekends and state holidays. The garden creates several favorable habitats for our native birds, butterflies, and pollinating insects and helps us determine which plants may work best in Southern Connecticut gardens. Plants are labeled for easy identification. The Bird & Butterfly Garden at Lockwood Farm is listed in the \"Nature Conservancy Open Days Di rectory for New England.\" Jeffrey Fengler and Jane Canepa- Morrison observed 1 2 different butterfly species, 7 species of bird s, and no other species around the garden at Plant Science Day on August 2, 2017.

Dr. Kimberly Stoner organized a conference entitled \"Pollinator Habitat in the Northeastern Landscapes: Pollinator Diversity, Crop Pollination, and Pesticide Exposure \" held at the Eastern Branch meeting of the Entomological Society of America held in Annapolis, Maryland, on March 19, 2018. There were six speakers and 35 attendees. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Center for Vector Biology and Zoonotic Diseases Collaborative studies involving scientists and staff from the Departments of Entomology, Environmental Science and Forestry and Horticulture The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 98 Rodent -Targeted Vaccine Bait Study U.S. Biologic, Inc. has developed a timed application system to disperse their Osp -A rodent targeted Lyme disease vaccine pelleted bait. Previously from 2014 - 2016, Dr. Kirby C. Staff ord, Dr. Scott C. Williams and Dr. Megan Linske completed a Rhodamine -B marker bait consumption study and a study of the vaccine bait in Redding, CT. The Rhodamine dye is commonly used in wildlife studies as it can be detected on the animal or in the whisk ers of the animal. In summer 2018, a bait consumption study using the new application system and Rhodamine -B treated bait pellets was initiated in forested plots in North Branford, CT. Lone Star Tick Control Project The presence of an established lone star tick population in Norwalk first came to light as a result of a June, 2017, report from a South Norwalk resident about a deer that was acting strange. When a Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protec tion (DEEP) Environmental Conservation (EnCon) arrived on scene at Manresa Island, the animal was deceased. But, the animal suffered from a severe infestation of ticks, which still completely covered its eyes, ears, head, and neck. Photographs were forward ed to Dr. Kirby Stafford, who examined the animal the following day and determine that it was covered by lone star ticks, Amblyomma americanum . Dr. Kirby Stafford, Dr. Dr. Megan Linske initiated a 4 -poster study in 2018 for the control of the lone star tick population on the island in cooperation with staff from the Wildlife Division, DEEP. Four 4- posters were activated June 1, 2018. Deer have been tagged at the Manresa Island site by DEEP for an initial density estimate of 53.4 animals/ km2, which is roughly comparable to deer densities of 44.4 to 63.7 deer/km2 reported for other areas with high populations of A. americanum , such as Shelter Island, Long Island. A sample of 104 nymphs and 100 adults of A. americanum ticks collected July 20 17 were tested by Drs. Sandor Karpathy and Christopher Paddock at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. The prevalence of Anaplasmatacaeae infections in host -seeking adult A. americanum was 48.0%, primarily Ehrlichia chaffeensis . Three of the adult A. were positive for E. ewingii . The Anaplasma phagocytophlium detected in one male A. americanum was 100% identical to the sequence for AP-Variant 1 associated with white- tailed deer. Deer are reservoir hosts for the AP -Variant and E. chaffeensis. 99 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Adult female A. americanum (CDC), lone star ticks feeding on a deer (Stafford), and Ehrlichia chaffeensis morulae cytoplasm of monocyte (white blood cell) (CDC). Pyrethroid Insecticide Spray Trial A spray trial testing the effectiveness of a combination of the pyrethroid cyhalothrin (0.8 ounces/gallon) and the insect growth regulator (IGR) pyriproxyfen (1.0 ounces/gallon) for control of ticks under two application regimes was conducted by Drs. Kirby C. Stafford, Scott C. Williams and Megan Linske in 2017 with the assistance of Michael Short and Heidi Stuber . Applications were made by a standard truck tank sprayer (875 gal. capacity, 6 -8 gal/1,000 ft2) or by a gasoline -powered low volume backpack mist blower (1 gal. capacity). Blacklegged ticks and American dog ticks were sampled on two occasions on transects of known length prior to treatment and 4 times post-treatment. The amount of activ e ingredient was the same for each application and only differed in water volume. Post -treatment, there was an average of 0.0 ticks/acre on properties that received the tank spray treatment (100% control), 10.2 ticks/acre with the ultra-low volume mist blo wer treatment (77% control), and 33.4 ticks/acre on the untreated properties. The spray tank treatment was most effective at killing ticks likely due to product volume (34.4 gallons per property). The mist blower treatment (1.5 gallons per property) was successful at killing ticks initially, but some ticks persisted post -treatment, likely due to smaller volume of product and less penetration of the leaf litter and vegetation. The study was repeated in the summer of 2018 using backpack mist blowers with a la rger 3 -gal capacity and output. Results are pending. Tick Overwintering Study Overwintering survival of I. scapulari s and A. americanum were investigated under varying conditions of leaf litter and snow cover by Dr. Kirby Stafford, Dr. Scott Williams, and Dr. Megan Linske with the assistance of Application o f pyrethroid acaricide by Michael Short, June 2018 (Stafford). Tick pot without leaf cover (left) and without snow cover (right). The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 100 Heidi Stuber and Michael Short at CAES and Charles Lubelczyk and Margaret Welch at the Maine Medical Research Center Institute (MMRCI) over an initial 2- year period (winter 2015- 2016 and 2016- 2017), supported by the Northeast IPM Center. This project was continued for a third year with support from the Northeast Center of Excellence for Vector Biolog y in the winter of 2017- 2018. Snow and leaf litter can moderate temperatures and provide moisture. This study examined survival with no cover, leaf litter cover, snow cover, or both leaf litter and snow cover. Nymphal blacklegged ticks and adult lone star ticks were placed in special \"tick pots\" buried in the ground with temperature and humidity data loggers. In the first year of the study in Connecticut, 94% of the ticks survived the winter in the control pots (no leaf or snow removal). Survival of I. scap ularis with either snow or leaf litter removed was virtually identical (85 -86%). Significantly fewer nymphs survived with both leaf and snow removal, but survival was still a respectable 77%. By contrast in Maine, results were more variable, ranging from 3 -23% survival with no notable trend. In the winter of 2016- 2107, survival of I. scapularis nymphs and A. americanum was similar, ranging from 38- 63% and 38- 69%, respectively. By contrast in Maine, overwintering survival for I. scapularis was 14 -56% with the highest survival with both snow and leaf litter present . Adult A. americanum survival in Maine was lower, 7 -9%. In the third year of the study, the winter of 2017- 2018, survival of I. scapularis nymphs and A. americanum adults in Connecticut was similar to the previous year, ranging 54- 67% for I. scapularis and 50- 69% for . In Maine, survival of scapularis nymphs and A. americanum adults ranged 31- 70% scapularis and 11- 81% for A. americanum , with the higher survival in both s tates again associated with the presence of leaf litter and/or snow. As A. americanum continue to survive the winter in these studies, this suggests further establishment in New England coastal areas is not only possible, but likely. Integrated Tick Manag ement (ITM) Lyme disease (LD) continues to be the most commonly reported vector -borne disease in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it affected over 360,000 people in 2016. The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapular is, is the vector for Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal agent for Lyme disease, and at least six other human pathogens. An integrated tick management project was initiated by Dr. Kirby C. Stafford, Dr. Scott C. Williams, Dr. Megan Linske, and Dr. Goudarz Mo laei with the assistance of technicians Heidi Stuber and Michael Short in 2016 -2017 in a cooperative agreement with Dr. Andrew Li at the USDA -Agricultural Research Service, which is funding the study. Conducted in several neighborhoods in Guilford, CT, bas eline tick and mouse sampling was conducted the first year. Seven neighborhoods were selected throughout Guilford based on their layout and proximity to large (> 200 acres) pieces of Town- or Land Trust -owned open spaces, and 91 properties (21%) have agreed to participate with good distribution among all seven neighborhoods. The treatments in this ITM study consist of different combinations of untreated controls and homes treated with various combinations of spray applications of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Met52 EC), the fipronil -based rodent bait box (Select TCS ) and the 4- poster passive acaricide application station for the treatment of white -tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ). Twelve '4 -posters' (1 per 50 acres) were deployed in October 2017 and maintained at one 600- acre park. Bait boxes were deployed and Met52 applied in June 2018. Host -seeking ticks are sampled by dragging the perimeter of each property biweekly May -August and white -footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) are live- trapped using Sherman box traps with the assistance of seasonal resource assistants Sarah Hemstock and Jamie Cantoni. Each captured mouse is sedated, marked with a unique ear tag, processed for ticks, and a blood sample was taken for serological analysis. 101 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 The 4 -poster (left), fipronil bait box (center), and application of the Met52 (right). Variation in Attraction to Pollinators Among Cultivated Varieties of Ornamental Plants Recent research on the value of urban and suburban gardens for bees has demonstrated that gardens can be an important resource for honey bees as well as for a diversity of wild bees because gardeners, like bees, prefer to have a variety of flowering plants blooming across the entire growing season. Although ornamental plants can provide nectar and pollen resources for bees and other beneficial insects, pollinator value has not general ly been a goal of ornamental plant breeding. Ornamental plants are more often selected for such traits as novel colors, more elaborate floral display (including double flowers), and longer flowering. Most ornamental plants are grown as \"cultivars\" - named cultivated varieties developed by plant breeders and maintained either by vegetative propagation or by controlled breeding of hybrids. Dr. Kimberly Stoner, assisted by Tracy Zarrillo and Morgan Lowry, is evaluating cultivars of five different ornamental pl ant genera to determine how pollinator visitation varies within each genus as well as across different genera. In 2017 and 2018, the team evaluated 5 cultivars in the genus Sedum , and 11 cultivars of Zinnia. In each case there were tremendous difference s in cultivars within a genus, with the most attractive cultivar visited 13 X as often as the least attractive cultivar within the genus Sedum , a 12 X difference in Phlox , 5 X difference in Echinacea, 9.5 X difference in Zinnia, and 5 X difference in Celosia. Funding for this project was provided by a Specialty Crop Research Initiative grant from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of the US Department of Agriculture.

The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 102 Detection of bronze birch borer and a visit from PREPSYS scientists PREPSYS (Pest Risk Evaluation and Pest ma nagement SYStems). This multi partner project, headed by Forest Research UK, is focused on understanding how Europe can best prepare for, and manage if necessary, the risks and impacts of emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis) and bronze birch borer (BBB) (Agrilus anxius ). The group is funding research in my laboratory into adapting monitoring tools used for emerald ash borer for the detection of bronze birch borer. The bronze birch borer is native to North America, and non- North American species of birch have little -to-no resistance to the beetle. If bronze birch borer were to become established in Europe, it could have a devastating impact. We looked at the efficacy of purple prism traps and green multi -funnel traps, both commonly used in EAB survey s, for detecting BBB. Since BBB feeds on declining trees, we also compared trap catches on trees that had been girdled, with trees that were intact. In 2017, our results showed us that BBB prefers purple traps to green traps, and those hanging in girdled t rees to that hanging in intact trees. A second season of experiments was begun in 2018 in collaboration with Dr. Peter Silk of Canada Forestry looking at the impact of lures with plant volatiles and a putative BBB pheromone on trap efficacy. On July 19 -July 21, 2017, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station hosted a visit from a group of scientists with PREPSYS. The scientists toured the station, discussed invasive insects with Dr. Theodore Andreadis and Dr. Charles Vossbrinck, visited experimental t rapping sites, helped to deploy parasitoids for emerald ash borer, collected emerald ash borer frass samples for training Austrian beetle- sniffing dogs, and discussed trapping and management of emerald ash borer with Dr. Melody Keena and Dr. Therese Poland of U.S. Forest Service. They also had the opportunity to do some biosurveillance at a Cerceris fumipennis colony in Monroe CT, and see first -hand the wasps bring in both emerald ash borers and bronze birch borers. Biosurveillance for Wasp Watcher Program The wasp watcher program was begun in the spring of 2010. Cerceris fumipennis is a native digging wasp that provisions its nest with adult Buprestidae, including emerald as borer. It is used a tool for Dr. Hugh Evans , a Senior Project Leader in Wales of UK Fores t Research and Dr. Gernot Hoch , Head of the Department of Forest Protection at the Austrian Research Centre for Forests exam ine a purple prism trap hung on a birch tree at Lockwood Farm in Hamden with Dr. Claire Rutledge . Dr. David Williams, an entomologist with UK Forest Research, learns how to spot a Cerceris fumipennis nest in Monroe, CT. New Wasp Watchers at Litchfield Middle School observe Cerceris fumipennis. 103 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 detecting and monitoring emerald ash borer and other invasive buprestid species by intercepting its prey as female wasps return to their nest. The wasp was resp onsible for the first detection of EAB in Connecticut, and remains our main tool for detecting and monitoring EAB in the state. We are in the 9th year of our Wasp Watcher program. Over the course of the program we have trained 135 watchers. In 2018, 31 wat chers from previous years are signed -on, as well as 8 new watchers. Since 2010, Watchers have collected over 8,000 beetles and detected EAB in 42 new towns. We have also used this system to examine the native buprestid fauna of Connecticut, and have detect ed over 70 species of beetles with this tool. Of these, 21 are new state records. Classical Biological Control of Emerald Ash Borer Following the detection of EAB in Connecticut, the determination was made to join the USDA APHIS/ PPQ biological control program for EAB. In May 2013, Dr. Claire Rutledge began releases of the gregarious endoparasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi and the egg Middlebury and Prospect, CT. The parasitoids are shipped from the USDA APHIS emerald ash borer mass- rearing facility in Brighton Michigan. Releases have been made in 12 towns in Connecticut altogether, the others being Hamden, Sherman, Cromwell, Litchfield, Plymouth, Simsbury, East Haddam, Weston and East Windsor. Each release site receives parasitoids for 2 years. We have been fortunate in finding in -state collaborators to aid in releases. DEEP has been generous in allowing us to release parasitoids in Connecticut Wildlife Management Areas and State Larvae of the endoparasitoid Tetrastichus planipennisi and the remains of an EAB larvae. CT. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 104 Parks. In 2016, we partnered with the Connecticut office of The Nature Conservancy, and they aided in releases at three sites along the Connecticut River and its tributaries. In 201 7, we were given permission by the Aspetuck Land Trust to do releases at Trout Brook Preserve. In the spring of 2018, we entered a partnership with a large private farm in Kent to do releases there. After releases, the next step is to determine if the par asitoids have established in the environment. Our first 2 release sites, Middlebury and Prospect did not receive any releases in 2015. In fall 2015, we peeled trees at those sites, and sites nearby looking for EAB larvae parasitized by T. planipennisi . We found them both at the initial release site, and at sites up to 2.5 m from the original site, strongly suggesting that the parasitoid has established in Connecticut, and is spreading. We also found T. planipennisi in Sleeping Giant State Park in fall 2016 after releases in 2014 and 2015. We are still attempting to recover the much smaller, and elusive O. agrili . In summer 2017, we set up yellow pan traps to look for O. agrili and T. planipennisi in both Hamden and Litchfield. We were unable to detect O. agr ili at either site, but we did confirm the continuing presence of T. planipennisi in Hamden. Further work on documenting the establishment of these parasitoids in Connecticut is in progress. Boosting Resistance to Emerald Ash Borer in Ash and White Fring etree using Methyl Jasmonate Emerald ash borer is known to attack and kill all species of North American Ash (genus Fraxinus ). In 2014, it was discovered that EAB can also attack and kill another native tree, White Fringetree (Chionathus virginicus ), which is in the same family as ash. While white fringetree is more resistant to EAB than white ash, both trees are less resistant to the beetle than their Asian congeners. Recently published wo rk suggested that green ash dosed with methyl jasmonate, a plant stress hormone, becomes more resistant to emerald ash borer. In summer of 2017, in collaboration with Dr. Adriana Arango Velez, CAES, experiments were conducted to compare the ability of methyl jasmonate to increase resistance of white fringetree and white ash to emerald ash borer. Larval establishment, survival and growth rate, were all measured. In addition, several measures of tree response, such as callous formation, production of defensiv e chemicals, and microstructure of cell walls will be measured. The most notable response was the very low establishment rate of EAB larvae on ash that had been treated with MeJA compared to control trees. This promising result will be followed with field testing. Southern Pine Beetle in Connecticut, Expansion of Geographical and Host R ange Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) Dendroctonus frontalis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), has been a major pest of the timber industry in the south for years. It has been moving northwards from Honduras over the last 400 years. It was discovered in Long Island in October, 2014. It was discovered in Connecticut in March 2015 on Red Pine in Wharton Brook State Park. Since this initial discovery, we have detected SPB across the state in all counties except Tolland an d Windham and in six species of tree, Red Pine, Scotts Pine, Pitch Pine, Norway Spruce White Spruce and White Pine. It is still uncertain if SPB is overwintering in Connecticut, the majority of Inner bark of a southern pine beetle infested red pine from Wharton Brook State Park. You can see adult galleries, larval galle ries (round) and the blue stain fungi , which the beetle carries and helps to kill the Flower of white fringetree, a newly discovered host of EAB. 105 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 the very low numbers of beetles trapped since its discovery in the state have been in coastal towns. It is possible that beetles are being blown over from Long Island, NY where a major epidemic is occurring. This spring, we started working with Dr. Alicia Brays at Central Connecticut State University and her MS stude nt Niklas Lowe to better understand the current status of SPB in Connecticut. Range Expansion of the Viburnum Leaf Beetle The Eurasian viburnum leaf beetle ( Pyrrhalta viburni ) can injure and sometimes kill cultivated and wild species of viburnum in North America. Both larvae and adults injure plants by feeding upon the foliage. Dr. Chris Maier, assisted by Morgan Lowry and Tracy Zarrillo, examined the distribution of this inse ct in Connecticut in 2009- 2010 and again in 2016 -2017. In the first survey, they found that this invasive beetle was concentrated in the northern one -half of the state. The second survey revealed that the viburnum leaf beetle had spread throughout the state, being present at 247 of 248 (99.6%) sites sampled. Thus, susceptible species of viburnum are now at risk of injury throughout Connecticut. Hosts of the Lily Leaf Beetle The lily leaf beetle ( Lilioceris lilii ) feeds upon Asiatic , Oriental , and native lilies that grow in Connecticut. The larvae and the bright red adults of this European beetle eat the leaves and the flowers of lilies, often killing cultivated plants where beetle populations are high. In Connecticut, this invasive beetle prefers Asia tic lilies, but it has injured wild plants of Canada lily ( Lilium ). In a field study, Dr. Maier and his assistants previously documented that the lily leaf beetle can severely reduce the growth of Canada lilies. Over the past 2 years, Dr. Maier and his assistants have evaluated the potential impact of this foreign beetle on other liliaceous plants by caging beetles on wild plants. In 2017, he found that caged beetles would regularly eat the foliage of Indian virginiana lanceolatus ), bu t they could not successfully reproduce on these plants. In 2018, he collected eggs laid on Asiatic lilies and attached them to the leaves of caged plants of the wild native species that the adults ate. After the eggs hatched, larvae fed briefly on Indian cucumber, Solomon seal, and twisted stalk, but none survived. In addition, with the exception of native lilies, the beetle was not observed on 8 species of wild liliaceous plants that were examined every 2 weeks in May and June. Based on all of the feeding tests and surveys conducted during this project, native lilies are the only wild plants at risk of injury from this invasive beetle. Longhorned Beetles of Connecticut The larvae of most longhorned beetles, or Cerambycidae, bore into the wood of dead or dying trees and shrubs or occasionally into herbaceous plants. Pest species generally feed upon the wood of living trees, firewood, or cultivated herbaceous plants. Dr . Maier, assisted by Morgan Lowry and Tracy Zarrillo, has been investigating the biology of these borers to increase our understanding of species diversity, Known distribution of the viburnum leaf beetl e in 2010 and 2017. Black circl es show sites with the beetle; hollow ones show those without it. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 106 distribution, and host use. To acquire new data, they capture adult beetles in traps baited with various sex pheromones or host volatiles, rear adults from wood infested by the larvae, col lect adults on flowers, attract adults to light- traps, capture adults in flight interception and fermenting bait traps, and examine label data on specimens in museums. In 2017, Dr. Maier and his team completed a 16- year study of host use by northeastern longhorned beetles. They reared 58 Prioninae, Lepturinae, Spondylidinae, and Cerambycinae. New hosts were discovered f or 34 (58.6% of total) of the species. In all, they reared 1,892 adults from infested wood to document 170 host associations, including 87 ( 51.2% of total ) new ones. The red -headed ash borer ( Neoclytus acuminatus ) had the broadest host range with 32 hosts, followed by the rustic oak borer ( Xylotrechus colonus) with 13 hosts; the remaining 56 species developed in 7 or fewer hosts. Adults emerged from 62 woody species in 33 genera distributed in 20 plant families. Over the past 11 years, Dr. Maier and his assistants have added new biological information to a database that now has over 18,000 entries, representing more than 23,000 specimens of longhorned beetles encountered du ring their studies or housed in museums. Biological information compiled in this database includes floral hosts, larval hosts, distribution, activity periods, and methods of sampling. These data should assist in developing management plans for destructive species of longhorned beetles and possibly for species of conservation concern. The ultimate goal of their project is to provide an annotated checklist of the longhorned beetles of Connecticut. Delayed Emergence of 17 -Year Periodical Cicadas Dr. Maier has studied the distribution and emergence of periodical cicadas (Magicicada spp.) for the past 40 years. During that period, brood II of periodical cicadas had large emergences in 1979, 1996, and 2 013. First in 1983, and then again 2000 and 2017, he noticed that a small number of periodical cicadas in this brood emerged 4 years late in the Hudson Valley of New York and in Connecticut. In June and July 2017, he measured the density of emergence holes at two sites with the highest density. The density of emergence holes was 0.1/meter2 at the Mohonk Preserve in New Paltz, New York, and 0.06/meter2 at Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden. The estimated cicada density per hectare was 1,000 in New York and 600 in Hamden. At these population levels, the adult females cause no detectable damage when they lay their eggs in the twigs of trees. In an attempt to determine if periodical cicadas in brood II could delay their emergence by 4 years, Dr. Maier and Tracy Zarrillo put cicada eggs on young apple t rees at Lockwood Farm in 1996. A large number of cicadas emerged at this site in 2013, but only one emerged in 2017. Although the emergence was disappointing ly low in 2017, it did show the periodical cicada can sometimes require 21 years to complete development.

Nursery Inspection and Certification Two hundred nurseries were certified to conduct intra - and interstate business. There were 178 nursery inspections during the growing season. Nursery Insects and Diseases The most important diseases and pests found in nurseries (in order of prevalence) w ere aphids on various trees and shrubs, thrips, lily leaf beetle, imported willow leaf beetle, red headed flea beetle, boxwood leaf miner, and powdery mildews. Nursery Dealer Permits Nursery dealer permits were issued to 92 firms. Phytosanitary Certifica tes Three hundred twenty phytosanitary inspection certificates were issued covering the shipment of the following plant materials to 31 destinations outside the United States.

Sixty -six inspections were made to assist nurseries moving the following plants interstate, either to destinations in other states, to the CITES port, or to US Territories and Puerto Rico (9 listed destinations). Nineteen consignments were bound for Puerto Rico, fifteen to Washington, and thirteen to California. Product Quantity Nursery stock (containers) 1,523 (bare root plants) 851 Greenhouse plants 1,522 Perennials 2,388 Seed (# Bags) 66 109 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Destinations for out of state export from CT, including US Territories and Puerto Rico. Special Inspections Three inspections were made for 21 individual plants to assist homeowners moving out of state. Permits to move live plant pests, noxious weeds, and soil In 2017, there were seventy PPQ 526 Permits (Permit to move live plant pests, noxious weeds, and soil) approved in CT. There were five Controlled Import Permits issued. There were no new permits for Post En try Quarantine approved. Boxwood Blight compliance agreements for shipment to Pennsylvania Four nurseries met requirements for shipment of boxwood nursery stock to Pennsylvania. Gypsy Moth Due to drought conditions in spring and early summer of 2017, the fungus that usually keeps gypsy moth larvae in check did not \"kick in\", and there was considerable damage due to larval feeding. We observed defoliation due to gypsy moth on 1,175,004 acres, mostly in the eastern half of the state, which includes Middlese x, New London, Tolland, and Windham counties. In December 2017 through March 2018, a gypsy moth egg mass survey was conducted in 80- 95% favorable host sites on a 7-mile grid (102 sites) throughout Connecticut . Egg mass counts were very high in many locatio ns, indicating a high potential for another outbreak in 2018. Other locations had many dead egg masses, indicating that there was some mortality due to parasitoids. Hemlock Woolly Adelgid and Elongate Hemlock Scale These pests have been present in CT for many years, and continue to cause patchy damage and decline among the remaining population of hemlocks. Statewide in 2017, 46 acres were affected by HWA, and 1,855 acres were affected by EHS. Scale insects, such as elongate hemlock scale and circular scale, are increasing in some areas, and may be more of a factor in tree damage and mortality than HWA. Emerald Ash Borer Emerald ash borer has been detected in all eight counties; the quarantine for this insect was ext ended statewide to encompass all of Connecticut. Detections and outreach efforts included monitoring of Cerceris colonies, trapping was suspended when the state became fully quarantined. During aerial survey, we mapped 10,318 acres defoliated by EAB, and e xpect acreage and mortality to increase in the coming years. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 110 Winter Moth Damage due to feeding by winter moth larvae has been concentrated in coastal New London County, and continues to increase. Parasitoids of winter moth have been released in this area, but their effectiveness in reducing populations has not been significant as yet; a lag time of up to 5 years is expected. Southern Pine Beetle This insect was recently detected in CT, and damage estimates are still in the preliminary stage. The infestatio n app ears to be widespread, however. Cynipid Gall Wasp Cynipid gall wasp was detected on the Bluff Point Coastal Reserve in New London County and adjoining areas in the town of Stonington in late 2014. The infe station has not been delimited. Apiary Inspection During the 2017 season Connecticut had over 642 registered beekeepers maintaining over 5,000 hives. In 2017, one thousand four hundred hives were inspected. Unofficial estimates indicate that over 5000 packages of Honey bees were imported into Connec ticut for sales to new beekeepers and to replace losses. American foulbrood was detected in five hives; these were destroyed by burning. Colony inspection determined varroa mite infestation and the viral complex associated with varroa infestation as the pr imary reason for colony mortality. The USDA APHIS National Honey Bee survey for 2016 identified a varroa mite average of 3.95 per 100 bees for Connecticut beekeepers, s econd highest in the Northeast. CT beekeepers continue to lose colonies overwinter in higher numbers; the Bee Informed Annual Loss report for CT in 2017 was 53.89 %; the winter loss was 49.83% . These losses are slightly lower than regional and nationwide trends. The viral pathogens that cause deformed wing virus (DWV), Israeli acute paralys is virus (IAPV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and even the varroa destructor virus (VDV) were detected in Connecticut as part of the USDA Honey Bee Pests and Diseases Survey. Due to high winter losses in 2017, local beekeepers continued to replace los ses with package bees from southern states. Despite these challenges, beekeeping interest is still strong with over 400 new beekeepers being trained this winter. There were one hundred sixty Apiary Certificates of Health issued. Four certificates were issu ed for export out of CT, and over one hundred certificates for interstate movement of honey bees. During the summer 2015, we established 40 permanent forest plots on state, Nature Conservancy, and municipal water company properties . In this short -term (5 year) survey, we will examine the death/replacement of trees due to emerald ash borer. Within each plot, 20 trees were tagged and will be evaluated for signs of EAB infestation, including branch and tip die back, woodpecker activity, and bark loss. We will measure the trees at Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) as a way to monitor their health . Plots were established in all counties of CT. In general, our forests remain healthy, but are under considerable stress from repeated drought and defoliation by gypsy m oth. Areas of forest damage mapped during aerial survey in 2017 are illustrated below with the 2017 -2018 egg mass survey results. 111 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 112 DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES Environmental Chemistry (Dr. Joseph Pignatello) The Environmental Chemistry program has been involved in research topics dealing with the interactions of pollutants with environmental particles, the bioavailability of pollutants in environmental particles, pollution prevention and remediation, and natur al chemical processes in the environment. It covers many types of pollutants, including industrial solvents and chemicals, fumigants, insecticides, herbicides, pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, engineered nanomaterials, and greenhouse gases . A. Interactions of Contaminants with Environmental Particles (Joseph Pignatello, Yi Yang, Santanu Bakshi, and numerous collaborators) 1. Effects of thermal air oxidation on the surface and adsorptive properties of biochars. Biochar (BC) is the char coal-like material remaining after heating (pyrolyzing) vegetative wastes in the absence of air. It has been studied for its beneficial effects on soil fertility and utility in pollutant remediation. In this study, we systematically investigated the effect s of post -pyrolysis air oxidation (PPAO) on the properties of BCs made from wood or corn cobs at heat treatment temperatures (HTTs) of 300-700 C under nitrogen. Including air during the pyrolysis step was found to result in BCs with a low surface area and underdeveloped pore structure. Substantial changes of BC were observed after PPAO, however. Well -carbonized BC samples made anoxically at relatively high HTTs (600 and 700 C) and subsequently PPAO treated showed significant increases in N 2 BET surface ar ea (SA) (up to 700 times), porosity below 6 nm pore width sizes (up to 95 times), and adsorptivity (up to 120 times) of neutral organic compounds including two triazine herbicides (atrazine and prometon) and one natural estrogen (estriol). Partially carbon ized BC made at a lower HTT (300 or 400 C) showed moderate increases in these properties after PPAO, but a large increase in the intensity of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy bands corresponding to various oxygen- containing functional groups. Well -carbonized BC samples, on the other hand, were deficient in surface oxygen functionality even after PPAO treatment. Adsorption of the test organic compounds on BC generally trended with the SA when it was less than 300 m2/g, but SA was poorly predictive of adsorption when it was greater than 300 m2/g. Overall, the results suggest that thermal reactions between molecular oxygen and BC, 1) increase surface oxygen functionality more effectively for low -HTT than for the high- HTT BC samples; 2) increase SA and porosity (< 6.0 nm) especially for high -HTT BC samples; and 3) create new adsorption sites and/or relieve steric restriction of organic molecules to micropores, thereby enhancing the adsorptivity of BC. These results will prove useful, not only for understa nding the fate of environmental BC, but also in devising strategies for improving the performance of biochar in practical applications. This work is published in Xiao et al., 2018. 2. Adsorption and desorption of nitrous oxide on raw and thermally air -oxidized biochars. Nitrous oxide (N 2O) is an important greenhouse gas \u2014third behind carbon dioxide and methane \u2014as well as perhaps the most important stratospheric ozone -depleting gas. About 60% of N 2O emissions are natural and result primarily from enz ymatic conversion of both ammonium and nitrate in soil and the oceans. Of the remainder, in the U.S. about 80% originate from agricultural activities mainly from fertilizer use. Addition of biochar to soil reportedly suppresses emissions of N 2O, but the ca uses are unclear. Some studies report the effect is only temporary. To determine whether adsorption may play a role in the behavior of N 2O, adsorption isotherms of N 2O were constructed at 273 K on samples of anoxically- prepared wood- derived biochars (300 -700 oC) and on a subset of those biochars that were briefly reheated in air at 400 oC. Adsorption of N 2O by the chars was greater and more reversible than by soils or 113 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 soil mineral phases. Adsorption by chars increased with initial pyrolysis temperature aft er post -pyrolysis air oxidation. The Langmuir maximum capacity correlates well with the CO 2-determined surface area, but not N 2-B.E.T. -determined surface area. At environmentally realistic partial pressures in soil, N 2O adsorption correlates with CO 2 adsor ption, and is found to predominate in the micropores nm), especially the ultramicropores (< 0.7 nm). Neither adsorption nor adsorption reversibility was affected by coating the char with soil organic matter extract. It is concluded that char added at levels above 1% in soil would act as a strong and reversible sink for N 2O, and could be responsible for the temporary nature of emission suppression observed in some cases. This work is published in Xiao, Pignatello, and Gamiz, 2018. 3. Structural transformation of char particles by C60 fullerene. Pyrogenic carbon (char) is widespread in soil due to wildfires, soot deposition, and intentional amendment of pyrolyzed waste biomass (i.e., bio char). Interactions between engineered carbon nanoparticles and chars are unknown. This study first employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X -ray diffraction (XRD) to interpret the superstructure composing fullerene (C60) nanoparticles prepared by prolonged stirring of commercial fullerite in water (nC60- stir). The nC60- stir was found to be a superstructure composed of face -centered cubic (fcc) close- packing of nearly -spherical C60 (100 nm) reproducibly disintegrated pecan shell biochar pellets (2 mm) made at 700 oC into a stable and homogeneous colloidal (<100 nm) aqueous suspension. The amorphous carbon structure of the biochar was preserved after the disintegration, which only occurred above the mass r atio of 30,000 biochar to nC60- stir. Favorable hydrophobic surface interactions between nC60- stir and 700 oC biochar likely disrupted van der Waals forces holding together the amorphous carbon units of biochar and C60 packing in the nC60 superstructure.

Bioavailability of Contaminants in Environmental Particles (Joseph Pignatello and numerous collaborators) 1. Bioaccumulation of cerium oxide nanoparticles by earthworms in biochar amended soil. The interactions of nanoparticles (NPs) with biochar and soil components may substantially influence NP availability and toxicity to biota. In this study, earthworms ( Eisenia fetida ) were exposed for 28 days to a residential or agricultural soil amended with 02000 mg of CeO 2 NP/kg and with biochar (produced by the pyrolysis of pecan shells at 350 and 600 \u00b0C) at various application rates [05% (w/w)]. After 28 days, earthworms were depurated and analyzed for Ce content, moisture content, and lipid peroxidation. The results showed minimal toxicity to the worms; however, the pyrolysis temperature (35 0 or 600 \u00b0C) was the dominant factor, accounting for 94 and 84% of the variance for the moisture content and lipid peroxidation, respectively, in the exposed earthworms. For both soils with 1000 mg of CeO2/kg at 600 \u00b0C, biochar significantly decreased the accumulation of Ce in the worm tissues. Amendment with 350 \u00b0C biochar had mixed responses on Ce uptake. Analysis by micro X -ray fluorescence ( -XRF) and micro X - ray absorption near edge structure ( -XANES) was used to evaluate Ce localization, speciation, and persistence in CeO2 - and biochar -exposed earthworms after depuration for 12, 48, and 72 h. Earthworms from the 500 mg of CeO2/kg and 0% biochar treatments eliminated most Ce after a 48 h depuration period. However, in the same treatment and with 5% BC -600 (biochar pyrolysis temperature of 50 m) with Ce adsorbed to the surfaces were retained in the gut after 72 h. Additionally, Ce remained in earthworms from the 2000 mg of CeO2/kg and 5% biochar treatments after depuration for 48 h. Analysis by -XANES showed that, within the earthworm tissues, Ce remained predominantly as Ce4+O2, with only few regions (23 m2) where it was found in the reduced form (Ce3+). The present findings highlight that soil and biochar proper ties have a significant influence in the internalization of CeO2 NPs in earthworms; such interactions need to be considered when estimating NP fate and effects in the environment. These results appear in Servin et al., 2018. C. Pollution Prevention and Re mediation (Joseph Pignatello, Yi Yang, and numerous collaborators) 1.

Peroxymonosulfate (HSO 5-, PMS) is an optional bulk oxidant in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for treating wastewaters. Normally, PMS is activated by the input of energy or reducing agents to generate sulfate and/or hydroxyl radicals, which are highly reactive towards most organic compounds. This study shows that PMS without explicit activation undergoes direct reaction with a variety of compounds, including antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, phenolics, and commonly- used singlet oxygen (1O2) (FFA), azide, and histidine. Reaction timeframes varied from minutes to a few hours at pH 9. Using a test compound with intermediate reactivity (FFA), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and scavenging experiments ruled out sulfate and hydroxyl radicals. Although 1O2 was detected by EPR and is produced stoichiometrically through PMS self - decomposition, 1O2 plays only a minor role due to its efficient quenching by water, as confirmed by expe riments manipulating 1O2 formation rate (addition of H 2O2) or lifetime (deuterium solvent isotope effect). Direct reactions with PMS are highly pH - and ionic strength -sensitive and can be accelerated by (bi)carbonate, borate, and pyrophosphate (although no t phosphate) via non- radical pathways. The findings indicate that direct reaction with PMS may contribute to degradation pathways and must be considered in mechanistic and product investigations of AOPs and other applications. There are many literature reports attributing the unactivated reaction of PMS with organic compounds to 1O2, a conclusion in light of our results may have to be reconsidered . Our results also signal caution to researchers when choosing buffers and 1O2 traps/quenchers for PMS or other reactions. This work appears in Yang et al., 2018. D. Chemistry of the Environment (Joseph Pignatello and Yi Yang) 1. Participation of the halogens in photochemical reactions in natural and treated waters. Halide ions are ubiquitous in natural wate rs and wastewaters. Halogen plays an important and complex role in environmental photochemical processes and in reactions taking place during photochemical water treatment. Photolysis critically affects the global biogeochemical cycling of halogen. While i nert to solar wavelengths, halides can be converted into radical and non- radical reactive halogen species (RHS) by sensitized photolysis and by reactions with secondary reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced through sunlight -initiated reactions in water an d atmospheric aerosols, such as hydroxyl radical, ozone, and nitrate radical. In photochemical advanced oxidation processes for water treatment, RHS can be generated by UV photolysis and by reactions of halides with hydroxyl radicals, sulfate radicals, ozone, and other ROS. RHS are reactive toward organic compounds, and some reactions lead to incorporation of halogen into byproducts. Recent studies indicate that halides, or the RHS derived from them, affect the concentrations of photogenerated reactive oxyg en species (ROS) and other reactive species; influence the photobleaching of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM); alter the rates and products of pollutant transformations; lead to covalent incorporation of halogen into small natural molecules, DOM, and pollutants; and give rise to certain halogen oxides of concern as water contaminants.

Armstrong, John Shepard, Michael Thomas, Michael Misencik, Angela Bransfield) Mosquito- borne viral diseases constitute an annual threat to human health in Connecticut . A comprehensive surveillance program complemented by science- based controls and timely public outreach are the most effective ways of protecting the public and reducing the risk of human disease. Experiment Station scientists and technicians monitor mosquitoes and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile virus (WNV) activity at 91 locations throughout Connecticut from June - October . The objectives of the surveillance program are to provide: 1) early evidence of local virus activity; 2) information on the abundance, distribution, identity and infection rates of potential mosquito vectors and; 3) information that is used to assess the threat of WN virus and EEE to warn the public and g uide the implementation of disease prevention and control measures. The CAES is responsible for conducting all mosquito trapping and testing activities. In 2017, statewide mosquito trapping was conducted from June 5 through November 7. Approximately one -third of the sites were located in densely populated residential locales along an urban/suburban corridor in the coastal southwestern corner of the state extending up through the Connecticut River Valley . Trap sites typically included parks, greenways, gol f courses, undeveloped wood lots, sewage treatment plants, dumping stations, and temporary wetlands associated with waterways . Trapping locations in the other regions of the state were established in more sparsely populated rural settings that included 117 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 permanent fresh -water swamps (red maple/white cedar) and bogs, coastal salt marshes, horse stables, and swamp -forest border environs. Mosquito trapping was conducted with CO 2 (dry ice)- baited CDC miniature light traps equipped with aluminum domes, and gravi d mosquito traps baited with a lactalbumin- yeast -hay infusion. Traps were placed in the field in the afternoon, operated overnight, and retrieved the following morning . Trapping frequency was minimally made once every ten days at each trap site over the co urse of the entire season . Adult mosquitoes were transported alive to the laboratory each morning in an ice chest lined with cool packs. Mosquitoes were immobilized with dry ice and transferred to chill tables where they were identified to species with the aid of a stereo microscope (90X) based on morphological characters . Female mosquitoes were pooled in groups of 50 or fewer by species, collection date, trap type, and collection site and stored at - 80oC until processed for virus. Aliquots of each mosquito pool were inoculated into Vero cell cultures for detection of West Nile virus (WNV), eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and other mosquito - borne arboviruses of public health importance . Isolated viruses were identified by Real Time (TaqMan) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) or standard RT -PCR using virus -specific primers. All of the virus isolation work was conducted in a certified Bio- Safety Level 3 laboratory at the CAES. During 2017, 195,543 mosquitoes (14,708 pools) represe nting 42 species were trapped and tested from 91 locations statewide between June 5 and November 7. A total of 125 isolations of WNV were made from 10 1, Ochlerotatus Oc. taeniorhynchus = 1, and Psorophora ferox = 1 collected at 30 sites in 26 towns in six counties . As in prior years, the majority of WNV activity was detected i n densely populated urban and suburban regions in southwestern (Fairfield and New Haven counties) and central (Hartford County) Connecticut. The first positive mosquitoes were collected on June 29, and the last on October 5. Three human cases of WN virus- associated illness which have been locally acquired (encephalitis/meningitis n=2, and WN fever = 1) were reported . Dates of onset of symptoms were from August 22 to August 28. Human cases were temporally and spatially consistent with WN virus isolations fro m mosquito pools . A single horse case of WN virus infection occur red in Fairfield County with date of onset on October 23 . There were six isolations of EEE virus from mosquitoes collected in New London and Windham counties and no human or equine cases were reported. Other viruses isolated from mosquito pools include: Jamestown Canyon virus (N= 25), Cache Valley virus (N=12), (N=128), (N=9), and Flanders virus (N=1) . All arbovirus and mosquito trapping data has been reported on the C AES/CT Mosquito Management website, the CDC via ArboNet and MosquitoNet, and to the Department of Public Health for dissemination. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 118 Impact : Participation in the statewide surveillance program provides timely information about levels of virus activity in the mosquito population which is used to monitor virus amplification within enzootic transmission cycles, and assess risk of human infection . This information is used inform the public and health care providers of these risks, guide disease prevention and mosquito control efforts, and prevent disease outbreaks . In addition, this large -scale sampling effort also informs out understanding of the ecology of mosquitoes and mosquito- borne viruses . Additional studies on the role of different mosquito species t o serve as vectors of viral pathogens may be used to target anti -vector interventions more effectively. B. Population Genetics of Mosquitoes and Epidemiology of Mosquito- borne Viral Diseases 1. Wetland characteristics linked to broad -scale patterns in Culiseta melanura abundance and eastern equine encephalitis virus infection (Philip M. Armstrong and Theodore G. Andreadis in collaboration with Nicholas K. Skaff and Kendra S Cheruveli) Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an expanding mosquito- borne threat to humans and domestic animal populations in the northeastern United States. Outbreaks of EEEV are challenging to predict due to spatial and temporal uncertainty in the abundanc e and viral infection of Cs. melanura, the principal enzootic vector. EEEV activity may be closely linked to wetlands because they provide essential habitat for mosquito vectors and avian reservoir hosts. However, wetlands are not homogeneous and can vary by vegetation, connectivity, size, and inundation patterns. Wetlands may also have different effects on EEEV transmission depending on the assessed spatial scale. Accordingly, we investigated associations between 119 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 wetland characteristics and Cs. melanura abundance and infection with EEEV at multiple spatial scales in Connecticut, USA. Our findings indicate that wetland vegetative characteristics have strong associations with Cs. melanura abundance. Deciduous and evergreen forested wetlands were associated with higher Cs. melanura abundance, likely because these wetlands provide suitable subterranean habitat for Cs. melanura development. In contrast, Cs. melanura abundance was negatively associated with emergent and scrub/shrub wetlands, and wetland connecti vity to streams. These relationships were generally strongest at broad spatial scales. Additionally, the relationships between wetland characteristics and EEEV infection in Cs. melanura were generally weak. However, Cs. melanura abundance was strongly associated with EEEV infection, suggesting that wetland -associated changes in abundance may be indirectly linked to EEEV infection in Cs. melanura . Finally, we found that wet hydrological conditions during the transmission season and during the fall/winter pro ceeding the transmission season were associated with higher Cs. melanura abundance and EEEV infection, indicating that wet conditions are favorable for EEEV transmission. Impact : These results expand the broad -scale understanding of the effects of wetlands on EEEV transmission and help to reduce the spatial and temporal uncertainty associated with EEEV outbreaks . Such an understanding will help us anticipate future disease outbreaks and focus resources for vector control and surveillance more effect ively . 2. Cache Valley Virus in Aedes japonicus Mosquitoes, Appalachian Region, United States (Philip M. Armstrong in collaboration with Fan Yang, Kevin Chan, Paul E. Marek, Pengcheng Liu, Jacob E. Bova, Joshua N. Bernick, Benjamin E. McMillan, Benjamin G. Weidlich, Sally L. Paulson) Cache Valley virus (CVV) is widespread throughout North and Central America and infects many species of domestic ungulates (sheep and cattle), but white -tailed deer are a likely reservoir. Anopheles quadrimaculatus and Anop heles punctipennis mosquitoes appear to play important roles in its transmission cycle in eastern U.S. CVV infection is common in sheep triggering spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and congenital defects (Edwards 1994). The virus is neuro- invasive in humans and there have been 3 confirmed human cases, with a single mortality in the U.S (Nguyen, Zhao et al. 2013) . Medical laboratories rarely test for CVV, belying its true incidence and impact on human health, but serological studies have reported high infecti on rates (18%) in endemic areas . The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 120 In this study, we report the discovery of CVV from the invasive mosquito, Aedes japonicus , from Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. The virus was genetically most similar to strains previously isolated in the northeastern U.S. To determine the vector competence of local mosquitoes for CVV, a laboratory strain was established from uninfected Ae. japonicus . Week -old female mosquitoes were offered an infectious blood meal (IBM) in a membrane feeder. After a 14 -day incubation, CVV was present in 41% of mosquito abdomens, 38% of legs and wings, and 28% of saliva samples. Impact : This study shows the first occurrence of CVV in Appalachia and demonstrate that the invasive mosquito species Ae. japonicus is a competent vector of the virus . Aedes japonicus readily feeds on humans and large animals such as white- tailed deer. Consequently, it is probable that this species may help contribute to local transmission of CVV . Phylogeny of Cache Valley virus isolates collected in V 121 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 3. Large scale complete genome sequencing and phylodynamic analysis of eastern equine encephalitis virus reveal source- sink transmission dynamics in the United States. (Philip M. Armstrong and Theodore G. Andreadis in collaboration with Yi Tan, Tommy Tsan- Yuk Lam, Lea A. Heberlein -Larson, Sandra C. Smole, B. Stockwell, Robert B. Tesh, Edward C. Holmes, Scott C. Weaver, Thomas R. Unnasch, Alexander T. Ciota, Laura D. K ramer, Suman R. Das) Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) has a high case- fatality rate in horses and humans, and causes sporadic outbreaks in the United States. Florida has been hypothesized to be the source of EEEV epidemics for the northeastern U.S . because of its year -round EEEV activity compared to the observed seasonal activity observed in temperate northeastern states. However, there has been insufficient viral genome sequence data to test this hypothesis in a phylogenetic framework. To this end , we performed high-throughput next -generation sequencing to determine the complete genome sequences of 433 EEEV strains collected within the U.S. from 1934 to 2014. These data substantially increased the size of publically available EEEV sequences and all owed high -resolution phylodynamic analyses. Phylogenetic analysis suggested EEEV evolves relatively slowly and that transmission is enzootic in Florida, which is characterized by extensive genetic diversity and long -term local persistence. In contrast, EEE V in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts was characterized by lower genetic diversity, multiple introductions, and shorter local persistence, although overwintering was observed. Our phylogeographic analysis also supported a source- sink model in which Florida is the major source of EEEV compared to the other localities sampled. In sum, this study revealed the complex epidemiological dynamics of EEEV in different geographic regions in the U.S., which may provide general insights into the evolution and transmission of other avian mosquito- borne viruses in this region. Time -scaled Phylogeny of EEE virus The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 122 Impact : Our data enabled us to address the long -standing hypothesis that Florida is the ultimate source of EEEV epidemics in northeastern U.S. Such information could be used to improve surveillance and intervention strategies against the virus. 4. Vector -Host In teractions of the Asian Tiger Mosquito, Aedes albopictus , The Potential Vector of Zika (Dr. Olivia Harriott and The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus , garnered international attention in 2015 after the emergence and rapid spread of Zika virus in Brazil and other countries in Central and South America, the Caribbean, and in the state of Florida. This mosquito species has been expanding beyond its native boundaries in Africa and Asia into temperate zones in North America and Europe, heightening concern about possible human health implications. Aedes albopictus has been implicated in outbreaks of Dengue and Chikungunya viruses in several countries in Europ e and Asia, prompting public health agencies in the United States to closely monitor local populations of this mosquito species. Connecticut is among 40 states where established populations of Ae. albopictus have been reported. As mosquito- borne disease agents are transmitted primarily during blood feeding, knowledge of vector feeding patterns and blood meal sources can aid in assessing the role of mosquitoes and their host species in disease transmission, maintenance, and amplification. We are investigatin g blood- feeding behavior of Ae. albopictus collected from mid -Atlantic regions of the U.S., using molecular methods. Of the blood meals analyzed to date, over 98% were from mammalian, and occasionally reptilian, hosts. These findings are consistent with reported feeding tendencies ascribed to this mosquito species. Impact: Detailed knowledge of the vector -host interactions of mosquito populations in nature is essential for evaluating their vectorial capacity and for assessing the role of individual vertebr ates as reservoir hosts involved in the maintenance and amplification of zoonotic agents of human diseases. Our study will clarify the host associations of Ae. albopictus in mid -Atlantic region of the U.S., identify vector host preferences as the most impo rtant transmission parameter, and determine the risk of human infection with Zika and other arboviruses likely transmitted by this important mosquito species. 5. Population Genomics of Culiseta melanura, the Principal Vector of Eastern Equine Encephalit is Virus in the United States (Dr. Goudarz Molaei, Dr. John Soghigian, Dr. Theodore G. Andreadis, Mr. Michael Thomas, Mr. John Shepard) Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) (Togaviridae, Alphavirus) is a highly pathogenic mosquito- borne arbovirus that circulates in an enzootic cycle involving Culiseta melanura mosquitoes and wild Passeriformes birds in freshwater swamp habitats. Recently, the northeastern United States has experienced an intensification of virus activity with increased human involvement and northward expansion into new regions. In addition to its principal role in enzootic transmission of EEE virus among avian hosts, recent st udies on the blood- feeding behavior of Cs. melanura throughout its geographic range suggest that this mosquito may be also be involved in epizootic/epidemic transmission to equines and humans in certain locales. Variations in blood feeding behavior may be a function of host availability, environmental factors, and/or underlying genetic differences among regional populations. Despite the importance of Cs. melanura in transmission and maintenance of EEE virus, the genetics of this species 123 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 remains largely unex plored. To investigate the occurrence of genetic variation in Cs. melanura , the genome of this mosquito vector was sequenced resulting in a draft genome assembly of 1.28 gigabases with a contig N50 of 93.36 kilobases. Populations of Cs. melanura from 10 EEE virus foci in the eastern North America were genotyped with double -digest RAD -seq. Following alignment of reads to the reference genome, variant calling, and filtering, 40,384 SNPs were retained for downstream analyses. Subsequent analyses revealed gene tic differentiation between northern and southern populations of this mosquito species. Moreover, limited fine -scale population structure was detected throughout northeastern North America, suggesting local differentiation of populations but also a history of ancestral polymorphism or contemporary gene flow. Additionally, a genetically distinct cluster was identified predominantly at two northern sites. Impact : This study elucidates the first evidence of fine -scale population structure in Cs. melanura throughout its eastern range and detects evidence of gene flow between populations in northeastern North America. This investigation provides the groundwork for examining the consequences of genetic variations in the populations of this mosquito species that could influence vector -host interactions and the risk of human and equine infection with EEE virus. C. Virus -Vector Interactions 1. Infection rate of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with dengue virus depends on the interaction between temperature and mosquito genotype (Philip M. Armstrong with Andrea Gloria -Soria, Jeffery R. Powell, and Paul E. Turner) Dengue fever is the most prevalent arthropod -transmitted viral disea se worldwide, with endemic transmission restricted to tropical and subtropical regions of different temperature profiles. Temperature is epidemiologically relevant because it affects dengue infection rates in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the major vector of t he dengue virus (DENV). Aedes aegypti populations are also known to vary in competence for different DENV genotypes. We assessed the effects of mosquito and virus genotype on DENV infection in the context of temperature by challenging Ae. aegypti from two locations in Vietnam, which differ in temperature regimes, with two isolates of DENV -2 collected from the same two localities, followed by incubation at 25, 27 or 32\u00b0C for 10 days. Genotyping of the mosquito populations and virus isolates confirmed that each group was genetically distinct. Extrinsic incubation temperature (EIT) and DENV -2 genotype had a direct effect on the infection rate, consistent with previous studies. However, our results show that the EIT impacts the infection rate differently in each mosquito population, indicating a genotype by environment interaction. These results suggest that the magnitude of DENV epidemics may not only depend The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 124 on the virus and mosquito genotypes present, but also on how they interact with local temperature. This information should be considered when estimating vector competence of local and introduced mosquito populations during disease risk evaluation. Impacts: Dengue incidence is expected to increase over the next decades as exotic Ae. aegypti populations and DE NV genotypes are introduced to new areas through human migration and trade, and as Ae. aegypti expands its geographical distribution in response to global temperature increases that facilitate year-round survival at northern (colder) latitudes. Studies of vector competence for arboviruses are usually performed at a standard 28\u00b0C temperature. Our results suggest that accurate vector competence assessments of these populations should incorporate the local temperature. Our data suggest that introduction of vec tors from warmer to cooler areas can result in higher infection rates than in their native range depending on the virus genotype. Changes in local temperature patterns resulting from climate change will thus have a positive or negative impact on the epidem iology of arbovirus transmission based on the introduced vector and pathogen. 2. The Role of RNA Interference in Arbovirus Diversification (Dr. Doug Brackney, Dr. Phil Armstrong) Arthropod- borne RNA viruses exist within hosts as heterogeneous populations of viral variants and, as a result, possess great genetic plasticity. Understanding the micro -evolutionary forces shaping these viruses can provide insights into how they emerge, a dapt, and persist in new and changing ecological niches. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the innate immune pathway of arthropods, RNA interference (RNAi), serves as one of these micro -evolutionary forces and can directly impact the diversity of virus populations. However, because of other forces such as genetic drift and genetic bottlenecks it is unclear the true role of RNAi in arbovirus diversification. We are currently performing a series of experiments to address this specifically. Using vir uses which over -express RNAi agonists, we will be able to quantify RNAi -mediated diversification. In addition to the canonical RNAi pathway, recent work has demonstrated that arbovirus sequences can be integrated into the mosquito genome and that these sequences can serve as templates for RNAi -mediated targeting of viral genomes. Our work will be to further quantify the contributions of this non- canonical RNAi based defense mechanism in virus diversification. Ultimately this line of research will provide me chanistic insights into arbovirus evolution and epidemic potential. 3. Factors influencing vector competence (Dr. Doug Brackney, Dr. Philip Armstrong, Ms. Angela Bransfield) The emergence and re- emergence of arthropod -borne viruses (arboviruses) over the last 40 years constitutes a continued and significant public health threat. Determining the relative risk for transmission is typically assessed in the laboratory by performing vector competence studies. Vector competence is the ability of an arthropod vector (e.g. mosquitoes) to become infected with a pathogen, permit replication and ultimately transmit the pathogen to a na\u00efve vertebrate host. This can be determined by providing the local vector populations with an 125 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 infectious bloodmeal containing the pathogen of interest (e.g. Zika virus). Subsequently, individual mosquitoes are assayed at varying time points post -bloodmeal to determine if the gut became infected, if the virus was able to escape the gut and enter the hemolyph (i.e., the open circulatory system), and to determine if the pathogen is being transmitted in the saliva. This basic procedure has been utilized for the better part of a century; however, for some species such as Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, it doesn't take into consideration the natur al habits of the mosquito. For instance, it is well documented that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes take a bloodmeal every two to three days in the wild. Therefore, we have recently begun studying the effects that multiple feeding episodes may have on the vector co mpetence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus to Zika virus, dengue virus and chikungunya virus. Surprisingly, we have found that non- infectious bloodmeals provided after the initial infectious bloodmeal significantly enhanced the rates in which the virus is able to escape the gut and infect the salivary glands. These paradigm shifting findings will change how risk assessments of vector -borne disease outbreaks are determined and help explain the explosive epidemic potential of viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. 4. The Role of Autophagy during Arthropod- borne Virus Infection of Mosquitoes (Dr. Doug Brackney and Ms. Maria Correa) Autophagy can be induced in metazoans by developmental stimuli or in response to various types of stress such as starvation, hypox ia, or microbial infection. During normal growth conditions, autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading unwanted or damaged organelles and protein aggregates. In times of cellular stress, autophagy catabolizes these cellular components, generati ng a pool of energy and macromolecules that maintain essential cellular processes until normal growth conditions return. Because this is a highly complex process requiring the reorganization of intracellular membranes and numerous signaling pathways, pertu rbations in normal activity, at any of these stages, can drastically affect the outcome of autophagic events. Not surprisingly, many viruses either directly modulate or indirectly alter many of these pathways and/or processes important in regulating autophagy. To date, our understanding of virus -host autophagy interactions has been limited to mammalian systems, yet arthropod -borne viruses (arboviruses) require both a vertebrate host and invertebrate vector for maintenance in nature. It is currently unknown if or how the autophagy pathway of vectors interacts with viruses. Our contribution here is expected to result in a detailed understanding of these events. The significance of these studies is that they will contribute to our understanding of virus -vector interactions. This is important because identifying cellular components/pathways essential to virus replication has the potential to be exploited for the development of novel control strategies. D. Mosquito Biological Control Life cycle investigations on a microsporidian pathogen of the mosquito, Aedes communis (Dr. Theodore Andreadis, Michael Thomas, and John Shepard) The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 126 A multi- year study was conducted to examine the natural ecology of the microsporidium Amblyospora khaliulini and more fully characterize parasite development and histopathology in all stages of its primary mosquito host, Aedes communis and intermediate copepod host, Acanthocyclops vernalis with the species. A. khaliulini exhibits polymorphic dev elopment, produces three morphologically and functionally distinct spores, and is both horizontally and vertically transmitted. Development in A. vernalis is restricted to females, occurs within the ovaries and results in death of the host. Development is haplophasic with division by binary and multiple fission producing rosette -shaped sporogonial plasmodia and infectious to Ae. communis larvae. Both sexes are equally susceptible and infections are confined to testes in males and ovaries in females. Initial stages of development include uninucleate schizonts that undergo karyokinesis forming diplokaryotic meronts that divide repeatedly by binary fission. Sporogony occurs in both host sexes, but spor ogenesis does not progress normally in adult males and elliptical, thin walled binucleate spores that function in vertical transmission of the microsporidium via infection of the ovaries and eggs are formed in adult females only. Development of vertically acquired infections in larval Ae. communis hosts occurs within fat body tissue, leads to the production of meiospores in male hosts only and results in death during the 4th larval stadium. Initial d evelopment is characterized by merogonial multiplication of diplokarya by synchronous binary division producing additional diplokarya. The cessation of merogony and the onset of sporogony are characterized by the simultaneous secretion of a sporophorous vesicle and meiotic division of diplokarya resulting in the formation of octonucleate sporonts that undergo cytokinesis and sporogenesis to form broadly ovoid meiospores enclosed within a sporophorous vesicle. The natural prevalence of patent vertically acquired fat body infections in field popul ations of Ae. communis ranged from 1.6% to 3.6%. infection rates in A. vernalis copepods ranged from 57.1% to 15.0%. Prevalence rates of horizontally acquired infections in emerging adult Ae. communis ranged from 69.0% to 11.9% in males and 50.0% t o 16.4% in females . Tick Management and Epidemiology of Tick -borne Diseases A. Spatiotemporal Modeling of Human Lyme Disease and Tick Distributions in Connecticut (Dr. Goudarz Molaei, Dr. Eliza Little , Dr. John Anderson, Dr. Kirby Stafford III) 127 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Lyme disease is the most prevalent arthropod -associated disease in the United States with an estimated 330,000 human cases occurring annually. Ixodes scapularis , commonly referred to as the blacklegged tick or deer tick, is the primary vector of the Lyme d isease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi , in the eastern United States. Connecticut has had pervasive populations of I. scapularis in all of its eight counties since 1996, and remains as an endemic region for Lyme disease. In addition to data for reported L yme disease cases from the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CDPH), the Tick Testing Laboratory at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES -TTL) has generated data annually since 1996 for human -biting I. scapularis ticks submitted by the public for screening of infection with B. burgdorferi . Tick-based passive surveillance data was used to generate estimates of nymphal tick submission rates, B. burgdorferi infection prevalence in engorged nymphs, and abundance of submitted infected nymphs. These risk measures were calculated for each year at two spatial scales in Connecticut: town (n=169) and county (n=8). Due to changes over time in Lyme disease case reporting practices, calculation of corresponding town and county level Lyme disease incidence was restricted to an 11 - year period from 2007 to 2017. Spatiotemporal patterns in tick- based measures and Lyme disease incidence were assessed with generalized linear and spatial models, and data from 2007 to 2017 were used in generalized linear mi xed effect models, together with land cover and household income data, to examine the association between tick -based risk estimates and Lyme disease incidence. Between 2007 and 2017, the CAES -TTL received 26,116 I. scapularis tick the CDPH reported 23,423 Lyme disease cases. Nymphal tick submission rates, nymphal infection prevalence, the abundance of submitted infected nymphs and Lyme disease incidence all decreased over time during this 11- year period. Nymphal tick submission rates, abunda nce of submitted infected nymphs, and Lyme disease incidence were spatially clustered while nymphal infection prevalence was not. We found positive relationships between nymphal tick submission rate or abundance of submitted infected nymphs and Lyme diseas e incidence at both town and county spatial scales but not for nymphal infection prevalence. When also considering landscape and socioeconomic factors, the best fitting tested model to predict Lyme disease incidence revealed a positive association with the abundance of submitted infected nymphs and a negative association with the percent of developed land at the county scale. We further assessed the model by comparing predicted and observed Lyme disease cases using spearman's correlation and through leave- one-out temporal and spatial cross validation. We conclude that data from passive surveillance, relying on tick submissions from the public, were strongly predictive of Lyme disease incidence in Connecticut (rho=0.945). Tick- based passive surveillance metho ds may be particularly useful in settings where Lyme disease case reporting practices change substantially over time. Impact : We find a strong relationship between nymphal submission rates and the abundance of submitted infected nymphs with Lyme disease i ncidence at the town and county level. This finding underscores the relevance of using passive surveillance based on ticks recovered from humans, and guides in the complex decision making processes concerning prevention and treatment of tick -associated diseases. B. Evaluation of Temperature -dependent Physiological Parameters Associated with Disease Transmission in Blacklegged Tick (Dr. Goudarz Molaei, Dr. Kirby C. Stafford III) The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 128 Climate models predict that the environment will warm in the tick geographic ranges. Historical data on tick dispersal patterns has been incorporated into recently developed computer -based models to predict how this warming climate will alter the biogeography of this arthropod vector. However, conspicuously little or no empirical information is available on the potential association between increasing temperature and physiological processes that influence tick vector competence. The overall aim of this proposed project is to reduce this knowledge gap by quantifying the effect of a w arming environment on a defined set of disease transmission -relevant physiological parameters in blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ). Specific aims of the project are: 1) Determine if a warming environment alters the density of endogenous symbiotic bacter ia. I. scapularis house endogenous symbiotic bacteria that mediate several aspects of its host's physiology, including vector competence. We will determine whether a warming environment alters the dynamics of the microbial population by quantifying the rel ative density of endogenous symbionts present within blacklegged ticks maintained at elevated temperatures, relative to their counterparts maintained under normal insectary conditions, and 2) Determine if a warming environment alters the transmission dynam ics of B. burgdorferi within I. scapularis . We will investigate whether a warming environment alters the infection dynamics of B. burgdorferi within blacklegged ticks. Specifically, we will expose I. scapularis to infectious blood meals, and then a) quanti fy the percentage of hosts infected, and b) the pathogen burden of infected hosts. These infection parameters will be quantified in individuals maintained at both elevated and conventional temperatures. C. Distribution and Establishment of the Lone Star Tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), in Connecticut and Implications for Range Expansion and Public Health (Dr. Kirby C. Stafford III, Dr. Goudarz Molaei, Dr. Eliza A. H. Little, Dr. Christopher D. Paddock, Dr. Sandor E. Karpathy, Mr. Andre w M. Labonte ) In the United States, the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.), is an aggressive southeastern species whose range has reportedly been steadily expanding northward. The number of A. americanum specimens submitted to the Tick Testing Laboratory (TTL) at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) increased by 58% from the period of 1996- 2006 (n = 488) to 2007- 2017 (n = 773), mainly from Fairfield County in the southwestern corner of t he state. The greatest numbers of A. americanum submissions to the CAES -TTL were from the City of Norwalk and a few adjacent municipalities. We also report the discovery of a large infestation of adult and nymphal lone star ticks detected on a dead male white -tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmerman), on Manresa Island, Norwalk, in June 2017, indicating a long established, undetected population. A sample of nymphal and adult host -seeking A. americanum collected July 2017 from Manresa Island were teste d and a proportion were positive Ehrlichia chaffeensis, ewingii , and Anaplasma phagocytophilum americanum tick and its associated disease pathogens are expected to become an increasing public health concern in southern New England. Impact: As A. americanum expands its established range into new regions and more ticks are found on humans seasonally in areas beyond established populations, it is expected that this species and associated pathogens will become an increasing medical and veterinar y concern in southern New England. D. Virus -Vector Interactions: Deer Tick Virus Population Dynamics during Infection of Ixodes Scapularis Ticks 129 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 (Dr. Doug Brackney, Dr. Phil Armstrong, Dr. John Anderson, Ms. Angela Bransfield) Arthropod- borne RNA virus es exist within hosts as heterogeneous populations of viral variants and, as a result, possess great genetic plasticity. Understanding the micro -evolutionary forces shaping these viruses can provide insights into how they emerge, adapt, and persist in new and changing ecological niches. While considerable attention has been directed toward studying the population dynamics of mosquito- borne viruses, little is known about tick- borne virus populations. Therefore, using a mouse and Ixodes scapularis tick transm ission model, we examined Powassan virus Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) populations in and between both the vertebrate host and arthropod vector. We found that genetic bottlenecks, RNAi - mediated diversification, and selective constraints collectively inf luence POWV evolution. Together, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for the slow, long - term evolutionary trends of POWV, and suggest that all arthropod -borne viruses encounter similar selective pressures at the molecular level (i.e. RNAi), yet evol ve much differently due to their unique rates and modes of transmission. E. Tick Testing Program for Lyme and Allied Diseases (Dr. Goudarz Molaei assisted by Alex Diaz, illnesses including Lyme disease (LD) constitute a major threat to human health in Connecticut. The disease was first described in 1977 following the investigation of a cluster of children with arthritis -like symptoms in Lyme, Connecticut. Ixodes scapularis, commonly referred to as the blacklegged or deer tick, is the primary vector of Borrelia burgdorferi , the bacterium that causes LD. Connecticut has had pervasive populations of I. scapularis in all of its eight counties since 1998 and remains a hotspot of disease transmission. In 2017, 2,022 LD cases were reported in Connecticut with an incidence rate of 56.6. In recent years, 95% of reported LD cases in the United States were reported from 14 states, including Connecticut. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 130 The CAES Tick Testing Program was established in 1990. Each year, an average of 3,000 ticks are submitted for testing. However, in recent years, the number of submissions has substantially increased. In 2017, the CAES Tick Testing Laboratory received great er than 5,700 ticks. In the past, testing was limited to B. burgdorferi , the LD agent, but in view of increasing human cases of tick -related illnesses in the state, testing has been expanded to include Anaplasma phagocytophilum , submitted by Connec ticut residents, health departments and/or physicians' offices, of which 4,458 were identified as I. scapularis . Of 3,989 engorged nymph and 6% for babesiosis; and 7% for anaplasmosis. Impact: As a passive surveillance, testing human -biting ticks provides important spatial and temporal information on infection rate and the risk of human infection with important tick -borne human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis, respectively, in Connecticut . Tick testing results generated by this passive surveillance, in conjunction with other lines of evidence, can also be use d to make the important decision as to whether treatment is required. Environmental Microbiology A. Alterations in sediment microbial communities associated with sudden vegetation dieback in a coastal wetland (Dr. Blaire Steven) Number of Ticks Submitted, Number of I . scapularis Tested, and Percentage Positive for B. burgdorferi in 8 CT counties, 2017 Ixodes scapularis Infection infection Rates with Pathogens, in CT, 2007- 2017 131 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 There is an increasing recognition of the role coastal vegetated ecosystems play in atmospheric carbon seques tration. However, the development of sudden vegetation dieback (SVD), a phenomenon which causes the rapid death of Spartina alterniflora, followed by no or slow recovery, has affected large- scale alterations in Atlantic coastal systems. In 1999, Hammonas set Beach State Park in Connecticut experienced the initial appearance of SVD. After more than a decade, the plants have not recovered. Yet, sediment chemistry was similar between vegetated and SVD affected sites, with the exception of water loading, which was significantly higher in the SVD affected sites. Soil CO 2 flux, a proxy for soil respiration, was reduced by 64% in SVD sites compared to sites that remained vegetated. This suggests that SVD has affected large changes in carbon cycling in the wetland sediments. More recently SVD has also developed at sites at Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island (Figure 1A). We are currently comparing and contrasting the sediment microbial communities between these two sites to characterize how SVD affects carbon cycling, microbial community composition, and biogeochemistry between two sites that differ in geography and the time since SVD development. B. Characterizing the apple flower microbiome for developing potential biological controls for fire blight (Dr. Blaire Steven and Dr. Quan Zeng) Fire blight, caused by the bacterial pathogen Erwinia amylovora , is one of the most devastating diseases of apples and pear. Despite the tremendous damage posed by fire blight, the control options for organic growers are extremely limited. Further, the removal of antibiotics from the list of organic control options by the National Organic Standards Board in 2014, put organic growers at significant risk for control failures. As the pathogens enter the plant through open flow ers, we are characterizing and screening the natural microbiome of apple blossoms to identify potential natural biocontrol Fig. 1. SVD affected site s in CT. A). Map of the two field sites being studied. B). Site of SVD at Hammonasset State Park. C). SVD develops as patches of unvegetated soils along tidal creeks, leading to distinct zones of vegetation status. Fig. 2. Bacterial species identified on apple flowers and their abundance. Each point represents a bacterial species identified on different flower parts (colored by the phylum to which they belong) the size of the point represents the abundance of each species on that part. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 132 agents that could be employed in organic agriculture. Our initial work has been to characterize how the apple flower microbiome varies with flower anatomy and apple cultivar. Overall, different flower parts harbor a similar microbial community (Figure 2). Similarly, apple cultivar was not associated with flowers harboring different bacteria. Taken together, these data suggest that the apple flower is colonized by a relatively small set of bacteria that are well adapted to life on a flower. We are currently isolating members of this community in pure culture and screening them for their potential to control fi re blight. C. Mosquito Microbiota: Transitioning the Microbiome into a Controllable Variable (Dr. Doug Brackney, Dr. Blaire Steven) The presence of a host associated microbiota or the \"microbiome\" (the collection of bacteria living on or in animals) is a commonality shared among most, if not all animals, including mosquitoes. Because of their importance in mediating mosquito development and their ability to influence disease transmission, there is considerable interest in understanding to role of microorganisms in mosquito biology. However, without the ability to manipulate the microbiome it is not possible to perform mechanistic experi ments. We have recently developed methods to rear mosquitoes in the complete absence of living bacteria, also called an axenic state (Figure 3). In the sterile controls the larvae do not develop, but when fed on a high nutrient diet embedded inside an agar plug, axenic larvae grow. H owever, their development is delayed in comparison to gnotobiotic mosquitoes (colonized by a singe bacterial species) or mosquitoes reared with a conventional microbiome. These experiments for the first time allow the microbiome to become an aspect of mosq uito biology that can be controlled and manipulated in a variety of experiments. Evolutionary Microbiology A. Ecological Genomics of the Microsporidia (Dr. Charles Vossbrinck) Recent advances in genomics and related technologies are giving scientists unprecedented abilities to solve problems in the biological world. We are using computational chemistry to look at protein structures (superoxide dismutase) of microsporidial parasi tes to learn how they protect themselves from the destructive effects, such as mutation and degradation, by oxygen radicals. We are now extending this research to other components of microsporidial cells. Fig. 3. Growth and development of axenic mosquitoes. Sterile control mosquitoes do not develop. Axenic mosquitoes show slower development than gnotobiotic (colonized by E. coli ) or mosquitoes with their normal microbiome. 133 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Figure above .

Identifying New Species of Microsporidia (Dr. Charles Vossbrinck) Microsporidia are single -celled parasites that can be found living inside (infecting) members of essenti ally all animal species. Our goal is to describe new species of microsporidia from a variety of animal species (insects, crustaceans, etc.) and to determine their phylogenetic placement with other microsporidia species. Through the use of traditional methods such as light and electron microscopy combined with modern methods of DNA and phylogenetic analysis we are uncovering new species of microsporidia that infect aquatic organisms such as Daphnia. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 134 At left we see Daphnia pulex , right is a light microscope image of the spores infecting this species (Berwaldia singularis ) and center is a phylogenetic analysis of several species of spores that infect Daphni a. Invasive Aquatic Plant Program (Mr. Gregory Bugbee) We are quantifying the locations of invasive aquatic plants in Connecticut's lakes and ponds, determining their effects on native plant communities, establishing baseline data to track their spread and providing information that is critical for management strategies. A. Surveillance and Mon itoring Locations of invasive plants in Connecticut' s lakes and ponds as found in CAES IAPP surveys from 2004- 2017 . 135 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Surveying aquatic vegetation in Taunton Lake , Newtown. Since 2004, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Invasive Aquatic Plant Program (CAES IAPP) has completed aquatic vegetation surveys of 230 Connecticut lakes and ponds. A total of 56 waterbodies have been resurveyed to determine how invasive plants are changing the quality of lakes over time. In fiscal year 2017 -2018, Gregory Bugbee and staff mapped the aquatic vegetation in th ree new and 12 previously surveyed waterbodies. Lake Candlewood, Connecticut's largest lake, was surveyed for the ninth consecutive year to determine the effects of alternate year, deep and shallow winter drawdown, and recently introduced grass Squantz were also surveyed. We established transects in each waterbody, using global positioning systems, to quantify changes in native and invasive aquatic species abundance and distribution. We collected water samples and analyzed them for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, clarity, alkalinity, conductivity, and phosphorus. This data , along with watershed information, is being used to investigate the factors that influence the susceptibility of waterbodies to individual invasive species. We archive dry specimens of all plant species in the CAES herbarium for future reference. We desig ned our Invasive Aquatic Plant Program to utilize the latest digital technology to rapidly and comprehensively report our findings to the public. Lake survey maps and other data are published online within days of their completion ( http://www.ct.gov/caes/ IAPP ). Nearly 60 percent of the waterbodies contained one or more invasive plant species and some lakes contained as many as four invasive plant species. The most common invasive plants are Eurasian watermilfoil, variable survey of Fence Rock Lake, in Guilford, discovered Connecticut's first infestation of Brazilian waterweed (Egeria densa) and our resurveys in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 found the population expanding. We have since found Brazilian waterweed in Lower Moodus Reservoir (East Haddam), Staffordville Reservoir (Stafford Springs), and Mono Pond (Coventry). We are working with the local lake associations and the CT DEEP to develop and test novel control technologies. Change in aquatic vegetation in Lake Housatonic from 2005 -2017 . The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 136 Locations of phragmites and variable watermilfoil in Bashan Lake in 2018. We surveyed Lake Housatonic in 2005 and again in 2017 to document changes in aquatic vegetation over time. Lake Housatonic is immediately downstream from Lake Zoar and we now have updated surveys of all lakes formed by the damming the Housatonic River beginning with Lake Candlewood. Our surveys found a significant increase in both invasive and native species over the twelve- year period. This provided stakeholders with the detailed information needed to begin management in 2018. B. Control Technologies The goals of this objective are 1) to resear ch novel means of control that minimize herbicide usage and protect native vegetation and 2) to investigate non- chemical management options such as winter water level drawdown. 1. Herbicides. Novel methods of chemical control with herbicides can rapidly remove invasive plants and begin to restore native plant communities to aquatic ecosystems. Bashan Lake - East Haddam, CT. We are in the 17th year of research involving the use of spot applications of the herbicide 2,4- D to control variable watermilfoil in Bashan Lake. We had largely restored the lake to preinfestation conditions prior to lowering the lake for dam repairs in 2014. Surveys of Ba shan Lake in 2016 and 2017 found a regrowth of variable watermilfoil and areas where phragmites ( Phragmites australis ) had become established. With support from the Bashan Lake Association (BLA) and the Town of East Haddam, CAES IAPP performed a targeted herbicide application of the phragmites and variable watermilfoil in late September. Our 2018 survey found little phragmites but the variable watermilfoil seemed nearly untouched. CAES is procuring the necessary CT DEEP permits to treat the variable watermilfoil this September with an experimental product that claims to be both effective and environmentally benign. Fence Rock Lake - Guilford, CT. CAES IAPP discovered Brazilian waterweed in Fence Rock Lake in 2009 and has since documented its yea rly expansion. Because this is the first documented case of a large scale invasion of this plant in CT and no information is available on its control, we arranged for testing the summer of 2014. The herbicide was applied by bottom injection to the shoreline areas of the lake in July 2014. A pretreatment survey on over 100 georeferenced points found 59 points were occupied by Brazilian waterweed. Although a survey one year later found only one point with the plant, another treatment was performed to increase the chances of long term control. We resurveyed the lake in July 2016 and 2017 without finding a trace Brazilian waterweed. We believe we have completely eliminated the plant without harm to the native plant community. 137 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 2. Winter water level drawdown and grass carp. Brazilian waterweed in Fence Rock Lake in 2013, pretreatment 2014, and three years post treatment in 2017).

Yearly changes in in the acreage of invasive aquatic plants in Candlewood L ake (deep drawdown years in bold). Candlewood Lake - Brookfield, New Fairfield, New Milford, Sherman, CT. Lake Candlewood's aquatic plant community is dominated by Eurasian watermilfoil. W inter water level drawdown is used to manage this invasive aquatic plant. Using state- of-the-art global positioning systems, we have documented the success of the drawdowns each year since 2007. The winter drawdown protocol consists of alternate year shallow (1 m) and deep (3 m) water level reductions. Drawdown timing and duration varies depending on the hy drogenerating needs of FirstLight Power Resources. These variables and inconsistencies in winter weather result in differences in milfoil control. The coverage of milfoil shows a negative relationship to drawdown depth. In 2015 and 2017, a total of nearly 10,000 sterile grass carp were introduced into the lake. These fish eat aquatic vegetation and we are determining their effectiveness. Our yearly report to The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FirstLight Power Resources, CT DEEP, Candlewood Lake Authority and other stakeholders provide data that is crucial for making decisions on future drawdown and grass carp introduction practices for Connecticut's largest lake. 3. Benthic Barriers. Lake Quonnipaug, Guilford and Bashan Lake, East Haddam. Benthic barriers are blankets designed to be placed over nuisance vegetation in lakes and ponds. They provide an alternative to herbicides and are thought to control vege tation by blocking the light aquatic plants need to grow. Benthic barriers are not new; they are typically placed over weed beds early in the growing season and removed in the fall. Recently, marketers of benthic barriers have claimed that their products need only be placed over weeds for a few weeks and then moved to another location or removed. To test this practice, we collaborated with the Town of Guilford and placed twenty- one 50' X 20' benthic barriers at Lake Quonnipaug's public beach for the third s traight year. The beach has had an increasing problem with Eurasian watermilfoil and fanwort (Cabomba caroliniana ). We placed the benthic barriers in early April and removed them prior to the opening of the beach on Memorial Day weekend. The results are pr omising with little vegetative regrowth throughout the summer. In 2018, we are testing the use of benthic barriers to control a pioneer infestation of fanwort in Bashan Lake. Further tests are needed to determine why these barriers provide impressive weed control even when they are used for short periods of time. C. Outreach . We strive to disseminate all information from our program to the public in a timely fashion and educate stakeholders in the identification, Benthic barrier installed over pioneer infestation of fanwo rt Bashan Lake, East Haddam. 139 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 prevention, and management of invasive aquatic species. We make every effort to engage citizens, lake associations, and other stakeholders. CAES scientists have organized several workshops (Figure 8) on the identificatio n of invasive aquatic plants. We also have given presentations to professional organizations such as the Northeast Aquatic Plant Management Society, the Northeast Aquatic Nuisance Species Panel and the Connecticut Federation of Lakes. In addition, CAES IAP P staff speak to numerous lake associations, town meetings, and student groups such as the Connecticut Envirothon. We have made our information freely and readily available via our website. Included are digitized interactive lake maps, our herbarium, and publications ( http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ). Our invasive aquatic plant control and outreach efforts have resulted in the protection of lakes and provided scientifically proven methods for use by others. Our works hops have trained hundreds of citizens to recognize and report new infestations in order to prevent future problems and the associated control expenditures. Soil Testing Laboratory (Mr. Gregory Bugbee) Testing soil samples for fertility and suggesting methods for growing better plants are provided for citizens of Connecticut. At the laboratory in New Haven, 6,457 samples were tested and approximately 1,500 related inquiries were answered. The soil testing services and recommendations made by the Connec ticut Agricultural Experiment Station reduce unnecessary fertilizer treatments to lawns and nursery stock throughout the state. This provides direct economic and environmental benefit to the suburban community by reducing nitrogen runoff into soil and wate r. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 140 DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND HORTICULTURE Connecticut's landscape is a quilt of forests, farms, towns, and cities. Scientists in the Department of Forestry and Horticulture are studying the factors that influence both forest and farm productivity, including how trees respond to novel pests and a changing climate, innovative forest management practices, the effect of the growing deer population on natural and managed landscapes, and novel specialty crops. The value of the forest to Connecticut is much more than the timber and other forest products. First and foremost, forests protect watersheds, aquifers and groundwater supplies that provide the bulk of our clean drinking water. Trees also provide air pollution control, acting as giant filters to rem ove dust, particulates, and some airborne chemicals. In addition, trees cool our environment in the summer by recycling water and reflecting sunlight. Forests contribute to the character of Connecticut and add to our enjoyment throughout the year. Forest Rehabili tation Study (Dr. Jeffrey R. Ward assisted by Mr. Joseph P. Barsky) Poorly stocked stands are a common problem across a broad geographical range - occupying more than 200,000 acres in Connecticut, 660,000 acres in southern New England, and 32 mill ion acres of upland oak forests in the eastern United States. In addition, there are another 57 million acres with medium stocking that are potentially one high -grade harvest away from becoming poorly stocked. Poorly stocked stands have too few trees to fu lly utilize available growing space; resulting in low productivity, including carbon sequestration, compared with fully stocked stands. Poorly stocked oak forests generally have trees of less desired species with lower quality stems and irregular stand str uctures that are logistically difficult to manage. Poorly stocked stands rarely develop on publicly managed lands and other professionally managed forests except following severe weather, repeated defoliations, or wildfire. While the majority of family f orest s (small, privately owned forests) are held for non- financial amenities such as scenic beauty or protecting nature, there is a much higher risk of poorly stocked stands developing on family forests as the majority have not received professional consul tation. Most of the poorly stocked stand s were created by high - grading or repeated diameter limit harvests which emphasize maximizing immediate economic return with no consideration of future stand growth and value. Returning poorly stocked stands to thei r economic and ecosystem services potential will require innovative rehabilitation practices that are at least cost -neutral. While there are suggested guidelines for rehabilitating poorly stocked stands, research has been limited to studies in southern pin e and hardwoods in Arkansas and mixed conifer/hardwood stands in central Maine. Suggested approaches have focused on stand level treatments, i.e., having a single prescription for an area of several acres or larger. This one- prescription fits all approach, unless the stand is uncharacteristically homogeneous for a poorly stocked stand, will result in inappropriate treatment for some of the stand and will likely be unacceptable to many landowners with less than one hundred acres. 141 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 An alternative approach originally developed for northern hardwoods in Quebec i s to recognize that poorly stocked forests are a conglomerate of stand types at the microstand scale (~0.1 ac) and to assign unique treatments to each microstand type. In 2012, Dr. Ward initiated research at five study areas in Connecticut to examine rehabilitation of poorly stocked stands. Rather than a single prescription for the entire stand, we used a prescription decision tree developed in consultation with CT DEEP foresters to assign treatments at the microstand scale to account for the irregular, spatially patchy structure typical of high-graded stands. The treatment prescriptions incorporated earlier research showing that crop tree release can greatly increase diameter growth and survival, together with timber stand improvement, for the several microstand types commonly found in poorly stocked stands: poletimber (5.0-10.9 diameters) diameters ), or regeneration. The goal was to determine whether this approach could be implemented on family forests, whose owners could accomplish much of the treatments by harvesting firewood and, in some cases, removing cull trees and release a limited number of saplings. Study areas were established in collaboration with Town of Guilford, Rebekah's Hill Flora and Fauna Preservation Society (Goshen), Weantinoge Heritage Land Trust (New Milford), the White Memorial Foundation (Litchfield), and the Winchester Land Trust. Study areas had nine to twenty -eight 0.1 acre plots arranged in 3x3 contiguous blocks to form a square. After initial measurements were completed, each plot was evaluated and categorized as one of four microstand classes based on initial conditions: poletimber, two- aged, sapling, or regeneration. Poletimber plots had at least five well -spaced acceptable High -grading results in poorly stocked forest stands with a mosaic of conditions such as this forest in Goshen. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 142 growing stocking (AGS ) poletimber trees - equivalent to a minimum of 50 trees per acre. Two- aged plots had two to four well -spaced AGS poletimber trees. Sapling plots had at least ten well -spaced saplings of desirable species (e.g., oak, white pine) with good form. The last microstand class, regeneration, did not have sufficient sapling or poles to create a fu lly-stocked future stand. Plots were then randomly designated as either control (no management) or treated (active management) with two treated plots for every control. Unacceptable growing stock (UGS) basal area growth was 60% greater than for AGS on bot h poletimber and two- aged plots during the four years after initial treatment. In sharp contrast, basal area growth of AGS was more than double that of UGS on treated plots. In general, AGS basal area growth was constant for a given microstand class regard less of treatment, while UGS basal area growth was reduced following treatments that removed a large proportion of UGS stems. Plots that had some residual basal area showed a dramatic shift in allocation of basal area growth from predominately on UGS stems on untreated plots to predominately on AGS stems on treated plots. Crop tree release on treated plots increased 4 -year diameter growth of sapling and pole crop trees, doubling growth of upland oaks. Impact: Our research indicates that a microstand approach has potential to increase stand value and growth and is economically feasible where a commercial biomass market exists or for landowners cutting their own firewood. Family forest owners can bring their poorly stocked woodlots up to their full productive capacity. This project emphasized treatment options that could be implemented by non- professionals with minimal training to increase the likelihood of widespread adaption by landowners without a professional forestry background. A very modest gain of 5% productivity across the three million acres of poorly stocked oak forests would be equivalent to adding 150,000 acres of productive 143 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 forest and would have the additional benefit of increasing value added by concentrating growth of trees of higher quali ty species with superior stems. Microstand prescription decision tree for poorly stocked hardwood stands in Connecticut Old-Series study - 90 years of n atural change (Dr. Jeffrey R. Ward assisted by Mr. Joseph P. Barsky) Ultimately, forest stand dynamics is the aggregate of growth and demise of many individual trees. Understanding the relative importance and interaction of habitat, climate, disturbance, and neighborhood density on individual tree development requires a large, long- term data set of geo-referred trees. The Old - Series tracts provide a unique opportunity to understand the mechanisms of forest stand dynamics by analyzing the recruitment, growth, movement among canopy strata, and mortality of mapped trees that have been monitored over a ninety- year span . During the summer of 2007 Dr. Ward with the assistance of a volunteer field crew completed the ninth inventory of these plots established in 1926- 27. The location, species, diameter, and crown classes of all woody stems > 1.2 cm dbh (di ameter at 1.4 m ) were recorded on 5.3 ha of strip transects. The data base of all nine inventories now includes 48,232 stems. W oody vegetation with diameters smaller than 1.2 cm are being inventoried using 1/ 1000 ha circular plots located at 128 foot inter vals along the transects. The regeneration survey is the fifth since the initial inventory in 1977. 2017 field crew (Paul Bryant, Rebecca Harris, Sarah Sullivan, Jant Bryant) Originally established to study the relationship between species and soil characteristics; these plots have chronicled slow, inexorable natural dynamics of Connecticut's second -growth forests . The four plots were established in stands typical of Connecticut's forests, i.e., stands which originated around the turn of the century, pa rtly on land abandoned from agriculture and partly on land repeatedly cut for timber or fuelwood. The Old -Series long- term study plots are invaluable because they have allowed us to observe the gradual segregation of species along soil moisture gradients and to evaluate canopy stratification models. In addition, thirty years after the study was started, there was an unanticipated twenty -year period of repeated defoliations by a non- native insect - gypsy moth. Subsequent establishment of a viral and a The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 144 fungal pathogen stopped defoliation for thirty years. Because defoliation levels were mapped and differed among the tracts, we were able to develop species- specific quantitative models correlating metrics of individual tree vigor to mortality susceptibility. In addition, we compared how stand dynamics and recovery differed by defoliation intensity during the first decades after defoliation ceased. With several years of recent dry springs, gypsy again became a significant defoliator in 2017 . We will now be able to compare the effects of defoliations in 60- 80-year-old stands (earlier defoliations) with those in 120- year- old stands (current defoliations). Prior to completing an analysis, we are adding data from the original 1926- 1957 paper strip maps. The new information includes many shrub species not previously included in the database along with tree diameters in 1932 and whether or not stems were part of a sprout clump. . J.P. Barsky working with the original 1926, 1937, and 1957 paper strip maps Deer Herbivory Exclosure Study (Drs. Scott C. Williams and Megan Linske assisted by Mr. Michael R. Short) One method to study the impact of deer on natural ecosystems is to compare growth rates and species diversity of vegetation protected from white -tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) herbivory to unprotected plots. Drs. Williams and Linske are collecting vegetation data within deer exclosures and adjacent control plots in collaboration with the Metropolitan Distric t Commission (MDC) and the Wildlife Division of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). Deer exclosures prevent deer from accessing vegetation within . Growth rates and species diversity of enclosed vegetation are compared with that of an adjacent control plot, where deer have access to vegetation . Plots have been sampled for woody and herbaceous plants for the past several years. Preliminary data analyses indicate that herbaceous cover within exclosures is greater than cont rol plots . Density of tree seedlings at least two feet tall is twice as high within exclosures compared to control plots . All locations will be resampled for both woody and herbaceous vegetation in late summer 2018. Results from this study will reveal plan t species composition and growth rates in the absence of browsing deer. 145 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Staff from the Wildlife Division of CT DEEP and Drs. Williams and Linske erecting a in a Impact: Overabundant herds of white -tailed deer negatively affect forest regeneration by repeated herbivory. This in turn will negatively affect the future of the timber industry and other wildlife populations in Connecticut . CT DEEP and MDC are using these data to scientifically justify and document the results of their deer management program to limit overbrowsing of vegetation by white - tailed deer to insure forest regeneration to protect the drinking water supply of greater Hartford . The Metropolitan District C ommission will use these data to monitor similar impacts by overabundant deer but as it relates to water quality in terms of minimizing erosion and siltation into surface drinking water bodies. New Crops Program (Dr. Abigail A. Maynard) Investigation of new crops is essential to provide new opportunities for farmers during a time of changing agriculture in Connecticut . Today, about 11,000 acres on 733 farms in Connecticut are devoted to vegetable production with a cash value of 30.2 million dollars . This compares to 19.1 million dollars from 582 farms in 2002. Seventy -nine percent of these farms are less than 100 acres in size; sixty -three percent are less than 50 acres in size. With numerous small farms, there is a need for growers to find a diversity of high value niche crops . In addition, small farm sizes in Connecticut have resulted in marketing shifts from wholesale contracts with local supermarkets to direct retail sales. Approximately 313 farms offer direct sales through roadside stands and sales ro oms, where a variety of fruit, vegetables, nursery stock, and Christmas trees are offered . About 36 of these are open all year . Nearly 20% of these farms offer pick - your-own fruit and vegetables to reduce the cost of harvest labor . These savings are passed on to the consumer . The development of a network of farmers' markets in Connecticut's major urban centers and densely populated suburbs is an important segment of direct sales of vegetables to consumers. All produce sold at farmers' markets must be \"Con necticut Grown. \" Farm fresh produce is offered at reasonable prices to The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 146 urbanites who cannot travel to the farms . Niche crops valued by diverse ethnic groups are generally sold at these markets. According to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, there were 1 14 farmers' markets in 2017, attended by over 400 farmers compared to 87 markets in 2007, a 31% increase . As the popularity of farmers' markets in Connecticut have surged, so too has the need for growers to find a diversity of high value niche crops . Consumers used to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in large supermarkets are seeking a greater diversity of ethnic and specialty crops at farmers' markets and roadside stands . A recent survey of vegetable growers by The Connecticut Agricultur al Experiment Station showed that over 70 vegetable crops are currently being grown in Connecticut . The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has been investigating specialty crops to provide new opportunities for Connecticut's farmers since 1982 . Over 50 fruits and vegetables have been studied resulting in over 50 publications . Results have been, and continue to be, communicated to growers at meetings and farm visits . Some of the crops studied in the New Crops Program include globe artichoke, Belgian endive, radicchio, heirloom tomatoes, sweet potatoes, specialty melons, okra, and tomatillos . Research included cultivar trials and experiments to determine the best cultural methods for growing each specific crop in Connecticut . Crops that were chosen ha ve a high market value and an existing or expanding market that would readily accommodate these commodities. Sweet Potato Trials: A 1998 Connecticut Department of Agriculture survey noted that sweet potato is one of the most popular specialty vegetables . In addition, it is very nutritious, with high values of beta carotene (vitamin A) and vitamin C . North Carolina and Louisiana are the leading US producers where they are grown in hilled soil , but we have found that they can easily be grown in Connecticut . Since they have a long growing season and thrive in warm soil, they have always been grown in the Northeast with black plastic mulch. However, black plastic mulch and hilling the soil increases both the labor and the cost per acre of producing the crop. In 2017, Dr. Abigail A. Maynard evaluated the effect of different cultural treatments on the yield and quality of sweet potatoes. There were 4 treatments: black plastic/flat soil, black plastic/hilled soil, no mulch/flat soil, and no mulch/hilled soil. Impact: The greatest yields were from plots amended with black plastic mulch (7.0 lbs/plant) compared to bare soil plots (4.0 lbs/plant). By growing sweet potatoes on black plastic instead of on bare soil, the grower can produce almost 44,000 more pounds/acre . At a retail price of $0.99/lb, the grower can gross over $43,000 per acre by utilizing black plastic. Hilled plots averaged 5.4 lbs/plant compared to 5.6 lbs/plant from flat soil plots. The long- term benefits of growing sweet potatoes include additional revenue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume sweet potatoes. About 43% of vegetable growers in Connecticut grow sweet potatoes. Okra Trials: Okra is grown for its long pointed seed pods, which are used in gumbos and soups. It is best picked when the pods are young and immature or about 2- 4 inches long. It is considered a delicacy in the southern United States particularly when breaded with corn meal and deep fr ied. It is in the same family as cotton, hollyhocks, and hibiscus which make it a nice ornamental plant as well. Okra plants are extremely drought resistant which make a popular vegetable in countries with difficult growing conditions. It grows best in hot weather with warm soils so that yields are usually increased when grown with black plastic mulch in the Northeast. In 2017, Dr. Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of ten cultivars of okra at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. In addition, the crop was grown with and without black plastic mulch to determine whether the expected increased yields utilizing the black plastic mulch is enough to offset the added expense of the plastic. Impact: Averaging both sites and both treatments, Zarah (49 pods/plant), Silver Queen (48 pods/plant), and Emerald Green (45 pods/plant) had the greatest yields. Yields from the black plastic amended plots averaged 87% greater when compared to plots with no plastic. Cultivar selection and cultural conditions 147 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 can dramatically increase yields and grower profits. By growing the cultivar Zarah (49 pods/plant) instead of the cultivar Red Burgundy (36 pods/plant), the grower can produce 13 more pods/plant or almost 126,000 more pods/acre. At a retail price of $2.99/12 pods (6 oz), the grower can gross over $31,000 more per acre by growing Zarah. In addition, by growing the crop on black plastic instead of bare soil, the grower can produce an average of 26 more pods/plant or almost 252,000 more pods/acre. At a retail price of $2.99/12 pods (6 oz), the grower can gross almost $63,000 more per acre by utilizing black plastic. The long- term benefits of growing okra include an additional product and revenue for growers who attend farmers ' markets or have their own roadside stands . About 35% of vegetable growers in Connecticut grow okra. Brussels Sprouts Trials: Brussels sprouts are related to other better -known vegetables in the mustard family including broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower. Typically, it is grown as an annual and the axillary buds, which resemble miniature cabbages, are harvested either by hand with several harvests of 5 -15 sprouts, or by cutting the entire stalk at once for processing. Each stalk can produce about 2 lbs . per stalk. Brussels sprouts g row best in temperatures ranges of 45 -75oF with the highest yields at 60 -65oF. Quality does not decrease from freezing, and, in fact, sprouts are considered to be sweetest after a frost. Sprouts that develop in hot weather often do not form compact heads a nd can be bitter. In 2017, Dr . Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of ten cultivars of Brussels sprouts at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. In addition, the crop was grown with and without black plastic mulch. Black plastic mulch controls weeds. However, as Brussels sprouts are cool loving plants and black plastic raises the soil temperature, it is important to determine the effect of plasticulture on the yield and quality of marketable sprouts in Connecticut . Impact: Jade Cross E (3.6 lbs ./plant) averaged t he greatest yields followed by Dagan (3.0 lb/plant), Corbus (2.9 lb/plant), and Dimitri (2.9 lb/plant). Cultivar selection can dramatically increase yields and grower profits . By growing the cultivar Jade Cross E (3.6 lbs/plant) instead of the cultivar Lee (2.0 lb/plant), the grower can produce over 15,000 more pounds per acre of Brussels sprouts. At a retail price of 5.28/lb, the grower can gross almost $82,000 more per acre by growing Jade Cross E. The long -term benefits of growing Brussels sprouts includ e providing a product that has growing consumer demand and additional revenue for growers who attend farmers ' markets or have their own roadside stands. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume Brussels sprouts . About 30% of vegetable growers in Connecticut grow Brussels sprouts. Butternut Squash Trials: Winter squash varieties such as butternut, buttercup, acorn, and Hubbard have long been favorite fall crops for vegetable growers who operate roadside stands an d attend farmers' markets. An Experiment Station survey of vegetable growers found that 93% grow winter squash with butternut squash the most popular. Consumers often purchase by the bushel because they store well and can be eaten well into the winter mont hs. Most squash varieties are long -vined and discourage home growers with limited space. New cultivars have been developed that produce fruit on shorter vines, allowing closer spacing. In 2017, Dr. Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of 5 semi bush but ternut squash varieties and 5 traditional long vined varieties at Lockwood Farm and Windsor. Impact: Ultra (long -vined) averaged the greatest yields (21.6 lb/plant) followed by Atlas (semi bush) (15.2 lb/plant). Cultivar selection can dramatically increa se yields and grower profits . By growing the cultivar Ultra (21.6 lb/plant) instead of another long -vined cultivar Quantum (11.4 lb/plant), the grower can produce almost 99,000 more pounds per acre of butternut squash. At a retail price of $0.59/pound, the grower can gross over $58,000 more per acre by growing Ultra. For semi bush varieties, by growing Atlas (15.2 lb/plant) instead of Butternut 1744 (6.8 lb/plant), the grower can produce over 81,000 more pounds per acre of butternut squash. At a retail price of $0.59/pound, the grower can gross almost $48,000 more per acre by growing Atlas. The long -term benefits of growing butternut squash include providing a product that has growing consumer demand and additional revenue for growers who attend farmers ' The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 148 markets or have their own roadside stands . Butternut squash is an especially important product for growers in the fall after a frost when other vegetables are not available. Pawpaw Trials: Pawpaws are shrubby trees that are native to the temperate woodlands of the eastern United States. The American Indian is credited with spreading pawpaws across the eastern U.S. to eastern Kansas and Texas, and from the Great Lakes almost to the Gulf. They are woodland understory plants that need shade to protect the seedl ings but once established prefer full sun. They produce maroon, upside -down flowers which are self -incompatible, requiring cross pollination from another unrelated pawpaw tree. They are not pollinated by bees but by flies and beetles. The pawpaw is the lar gest edible fruit native to America. Individual fruits weigh 5 to 16 ounces and are 3 to 6 inches in length. The tasty fruit has a smooth, custard texture. In this trial, 4 cultivars of pawpaws were planted in 2002. Since 2013, annual yields were recorded from each tree Impact: Thus far, the cultivars Rebecca's Gold and Overleese have averaged the greatest yields (67 and 48 fruit/tree, respectively) with Sunflower producing the largest fruit (7.6 oz/fruit). Pawpaws are an ideal fruit for Connecticut growers who attend farmers ' markets or have their own roadside stands as they are very delicate and difficult to ship long distances. The long- term benefits of growing pawpaws include an additional unique product and revenue for growers . Sheet Composting of Oa k and Maple Leaves Many municipalities in Connecticut with leaf collection programs in the fall are turning to farmers to dispose of their leaves. However, not all farmers have extra land to set aside for a standard composting operation. Instead, they layer undecomposed leaves on their fields and simply plow the leaves under . This is called sheet composting . Nitrogen deficiency can be a problem in these soils because microorganisms involved in leaf decomposition use nitrogen more efficiently than plants . There is some question whether the differences in the rates of decomposition between oak and maple leaves would lead to differences in plant response when these leaves are used in a sheet composting operation . This is also a situation that confronts many home gardeners who have a predominance of oaks in their backyards. To help answer this question, Dr . Maynard conducted a sheet composting experiment in which plots were amended with either all oak or all maple leaves. Undecomposed leaves were layered abo ut 6 inches thick in the falls of 1994- 2016 and incorporated into the soil by rototilling . In 2017, t he greatest cabbage yields were from plots amended with oak leaves (3.3 lb/plant ) followed by plots amended with maple leaves (3.2 lb/plant) and the unamen ded control plots (3.0 lb/plant). For peppers, the greatest yields were from plots amended with maple leaves (4.7 lb/plant) compared to 4.6 lb/plant from the unamended control plots and 4.3 lb/plant from plots amended with oak leaves. For onions, plots ame nded with maple leaves averaged the greatest yields (7.4 lb/10 ft row) followed by plots amended with oak leaves (7.2 lb/10 ft row) and the unamended control plots (6.6 lb/10 ft row). Average yields of 12 different vegetable crops over 23 years show no sig nificant differences between the treatments. Impact: Many Connecticut homeowners are now disposing of their oak and maple leaves in their gardens without worrying about any deleterious effects on yields in their vegetable gardens . Incorporating tree leaves into gardens improves the environment by storing carbon in the soil and reducing the volume of material in the solid waste collection and disposal system . 149 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY Using Nanoparticles to Enhance Plant H ealth Nanoparticles (NP) of metalloid and metallic oxides (< 100 nm) have great potential in agriculture as a means to deliver essential micronutrients like B, Cu, Mn, and Zn along with beneficial elements like Si. These elements important roles in activating enzyme systems important in host defense and form dismutase enzymes that detoxify free radicals . Since Cu, Mn, and Zn have poor intraplant mobility and poor availability in neutral soils, we explored the use of foliar sprays of NP to nourish susceptible root systems and protect against soilborne disease. Drs. Elmer has conducted greenhouse and field trials on many vegetable and ornamental plants. While NP performance varied across all studies, we observed that NP of CuO and CuPO 4 enhance plant health and suppressed disease more consistently than other NP . Transcriptomics of tomato roots treated with NP of Cu have revealed a g radual uploading of host defense genes (Figure 1). Field experiments were conducted in the 2016- 2018 field season where the individual and combined effects of NP of CuO, MnO, and ZnO were examined for their on yield of eggplant in soil infested with Verticillium dahliae . We discovered that NP of CuO and MnO alone along with all the combination of all three improved yield and growth performance. Impact : These studies reveal that application of NPs of micronutrients offer an improve delivery system for these crucial element to susceptible tissues. Nanoparticles may be the new weapon in plant disease management . Winegrapes in Connecticut In cooperative involvement with the \"NE the project, \"Coordinated wine grape variety evaluations in the eastern USA,\" which was initiated by Dr. Nail in 2008. This year three more cold- hardy hybrid cultivars ( Itasca, Aromella, and Briana) have been planted at the three CAES research farms. The performance of the 15 cultivars at these three locations will provide information on the effect of climate variation on growth, yield, and disease susceptibility. Figure 1. Tomato plants exposed to NP of CuO (Upper) or CuPO 4 (Lower) and inoculated with the Fusarium wilt fungus or left untreated. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 150 Figur e 2. 3D-sonic anemometers measure wind data in a Pinot Gris vineyard at Lockwood Farm. Dr. Ferrandino is continuing his work on 3D Lagrangian Stochastic Simulation for turbulent flows in hedgerow canopies in collaboration with Dr. D. E. Aylor. These simulations are programmed in Microsoft Visual Studio . The verification of such models requires direct measurement of turbulent wind statistics . 3D-sonic anemometers are deployed in the vineyard to collect this information. Since 2009, Dr. Ferrandino has maintained three remote sensing weather stations located on the CAES research farms (Hamden, CT; Windsor, CT; Griswold, CT). Weather data from the three CAES experimental is available at: https://www.hobolink.com/s/d0696313715dd96f86b25f3552cc1f47 . This link is available on the CAES website. Each weather station measures temperature, relative humidity, sunlight, wind speed and direction, rainfall, leaf wetness and soil temperature every 15 minutes. On-site weather station data are used to calculate disease risk assessments, which are delivered to the winegrape growers on a weekly basis. Impact : The planting of a vineyard requires a large investment ($4,500/acre) with no expected ret urn for at least 3 years. Thus the choice of a suitable cultivar is critical to the eventual success of such an enterprise . Improved models of spore dispersal enable better predictions of the spread of disease. Growers are alerted when disease risk is high . Early fungicide sprays are more efficacious and may reduce the need for later applications reducing overall use of chemicals. Analytical Epidemiology Dr. Ferrandino is examining model solutions to the advective -diffusion equation which describe the dispersal of airborne particles near the edge of a field. Most previous work has concentrated on steady state dispersal over a very large area. However , the importance of transient solutions at the edge of a field or between two different fields is not wel l studied . This involves a detailed description of the relative flux of particles to the ground, foliage and downwind targets . When used to describe pollen dispersal, this is important in the quantification of outcrossing, particularly in the generation of GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) seed stock . When applied to aerosol droplets of pesticide or herbicide the model will predict the expected spray drift dose. Figure 3 . An illustrated model showing advective -diffusion that occurs near the edge of a fie ld. 151 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Impact: To maintain seed purity in plant breeding programs, or in seed production fields, or in commercial grain production fields it is important to limit as much as possible cross fertilization between plots or fields of maize (or other grasses) of different types (cultivars) . Thus, border strips of isolating foliage are used to genetically isolate different fields . The necessary width of these strips depends on a thorough knowledge of the transport processes between fields. Quantifying Uncertainty in Tomography- Based Estimates of C in Living Northern Hardwoods . Dr. Marra's National Science Foundation funded project resulted in the development and validation of a novel and unprecedented methodology, using sonic and electrical -resistance tomography (SoT and ERT), for nondestructive quantification of sequestered structural carbon (C) present in living trees. Most importantly, the methodology derives its accuracy by using tomography to account for the role of internal decay in releasing C back to the a tmosphere. An additional benefit of the project was the validation of the accuracy with which SoT and ERT permit qualitative assessment of the internal condition of trees, as shown in the Decision Rules Table (Table 1) and Figure 4, which will be of benefi t to the tree -care industry . A manuscript describing this work has been submitted by invitation for publication in the Environmental Research Letters' \"Special Focus\" issue, \"Focus on Carbon Monitoring Systems Research and Applications.\" Figure 4 : Stem- disk SoT and ERT tomograms and photographs corresponding to each of four decay categories, according to Table 1.

The results of this project will constitute an important first step in Dr. Marra's long -term goals of addressing these critical missing components, and contributing data that will be relevant to other ecologists and carbon balance modelers. Pending the successful procurement of additional research funds, Dr. Marra's methodology will be applied at larger scales in northern hardwood forests, and will also be applied to longer -term (5 -, 10-, 15- year) studies that will constitute the first inquiry into rates of internal decay at these scales. Using Tomography to Nondestructively Assess the Impact of Perennial Injections for Treatment of Dutch Elm Disease on Internal Decay. The native American Elm, with its unique umbrella -like canopy, is the iconic tree of streets and parks of the American landscape. For nearly a century, the American Elm has been decimated by Dutch elm disease (DED), caused by the invasive fungal pathogen, Ophiostoma novo -ulmi, which is spread by both elm bark beetles (also invasive) and by intraspecific root grafts, further propitiated by the traditional monocultural planting of this magnificent tree. The most effective treatment of DED has been through the delivery of fungicides, principally as prophylactics, via multiple injections around the perimeter of the trunk, administered through small (~1/4\") holes drilled through the bark and into the conducting tissue (the xylem) . Effective control via this treat ment regime requires that these injections be repeated once every one to three years . Although the trunk- root interface is physiologically prone to rapid compartmentalization and healing around holes such as those drilled for these injections, the holes still represent a potential entry point for a variety of wood- decaying fungi and bacteria . However, no research to date has been done to determine if elms undergoing regular (every 1 -3 years) injections have a higher incidence and severity of internal decay relative to those that do not receive injections . Dr. Marra and his collaborator on this project, Dr. Nicholas Brazee (University of Massachusetts Amherst), have undertaken a three -year study using sonic and electrical -resistance tomography to nondestr uctively examine elms that have been undergoing regular fungicide injections for treatment of DED, and to compare these elms to elms that have not received injections. Elms in this latter category are typically maintained through vigilant scouting for early signs of elm bark beetles and DED, followed by aggressive pruning and other strategies for maximizing the trees' health and vigor. While this project is still underway, to date Drs. Marra and Brazee have performed tomographic scans on 201 elms in Conne cticut, Massachusetts, New York City (Governors Island), and the National Mall of Washington, D.C. Of these, 96 trees have been receiving fungicide injections, and 115 have not. The elms 153 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 of the National Mall are of particular significance to this study because fungicide injections have not been used; the National Park Service has instead opted for scouting, pruning, and, in cases of severe infection, replacement . Preliminary results show only a small difference in the incidence of decay between the two groups: 33% of the injected elms, compared to 28% of the non- injected elms, harbored some degree of internal decay. Impact : As American elms of the urban landscape continue to mature, their continued survival despite the onslaught of Dutch elm disease will be via aggressive management regimens that include routine trunk injections. The consequences of these repeated injections are not well -understood, and management decisions are so far uninformed by the potential consequences of injections vis- \u00e0-vis interna l decay . This work should facilitate those responsible for the care of these trees to make and advise more informed decisions, especially in the case of trees shown by tomography to have advanced stages of decay . Genetic Variation and Dispersal Dynamics in Fusarium palustre , associated with Sudden Vegetation Dieback in salt marshes of eastern United States With assistance from a M.S. student at Southern Connecticut State University, Alysha Auslender, Dr. Marra continues to pursue his , a fungal pathogen of Spartina alterniflora that was described by Drs. Marra and Elmer. Because of the unique nature of F. palustre distribution (i.e., in isolated patches in discontinuous salt marshes), Dr. Marra is interested in testing hypotheses about the introduction and spread of the pathogen, and relatedness among populations. A key component of wetland dieback syndrome, F. palustre has been shown by Dr. Marra to have a surprisingly high degree of genetic diversity both within and among populations sampled from various marshes ranging from Louisiana to Maine. In addition to constructing molecular phylogenies using DNA sequences from three genes, Dr. Marra has used Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP) in a preliminary study to show a significant amount of genetic variability among a group of approximately 100 F. palustre isolates North America as well as several from China. The genetic diversity in F. palustre demonstrated via AFLP analysis warranted the development of a more robust set of genetic markers for purposes of studying the epidemiology of this fungus. To that end, Dr. Marra and Ms. Auslender have generated a whole- genome sequence for the fungus's type specimen, CaesSaCT2, through the facilities at the Yale Center for Genom e Analysis. The genome is currently being used to screen for candidate microsatellite loci. Primers designed around these loci are being tested for length polymorphisms against a screening population of 32 isolates representing the currently known distribu tion of the fungus . The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 154 Figure 5 : Ms. Alysha Auslender, Master's student from Southern Connecticut State University, testing Fusarium palustre isolates for microsatellite locus polymorphisms. Impact : The appearance of SVD in multiple marshes over large areas makes it of considerable ecological and societal importance. Our findings will provide insight into the critical factors associated with the distribution of F. palustre in SVD sites and lay an unde rstanding for how genetic exchange may operate in this fungus. Neonectria Canker caused by Neonectria ditissima Perennial Target Canker (also known as Neonectria canker) continues to be researched by Dr. Marra. This research focuses on the ecology and ge netics of the causal agent of perennial target canker, the fungal pathogen, Neonectria ditissima . The goal of this research is to gain a fuller understanding of the life history, evolution, population dynamics, and host -interactions of N. ditissima , particularly with respect to its principle hosts, black and yellow birch ( Betula lenta and B. alleghaniensis ). Fundamental knowledge of the natural history of N. ditissima is lacking, yet is an essential component to effective management strategies. Dr. Ma rra has developed the field techniques and laboratory tools necessary to the study of this fungus and the disease it causes, and has used these tools and methods to examine the relationship between mating system and genetic structure. Previously, Dr. Ma rra developed and used a set of 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers to study mating and genetic differentiation in N. ditissima from two nearly adjacent sites at West Rock Ridge State Park in New Haven, CT . This study revealed a paradoxical juxtaposition of high levels of genetic diversity alongside high levels of selfing and biparental inbreeding. The results confirm an earlier hypothesis that N. ditissima has a \"mixed mating system\" (selfing and outcrossing occurring in the same population). All observa tions of selfing were confirmed through the use of AFLPs. With the assistance during June and July of 2018 of a USDA Plant Health Fellow, Dr. Marra is in the process of analyzing the genetic relatedness of N. ditissima isolates sampled from cankers vertically distributed on each of four black birch trees (Figure 6), which were felled in June 2018. To date, 12 isolates have been successfully isolated and taken to pure culture from these cankers. Once pure cultures for all 28 cankers have been obtained, they will be genotyped using Dr. Marra's microsatellite markers. These microsatellite data will then be used to test the hypothesis that genotypes from the same tree are more closely related than those among trees . 155 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year along stem. Because cankers typically only form on stems younger than ~15 years of age, lower cankers were likely initiated many years before those higher up the stem . Figure 7: The USDA Plant Health Fellow, Melvin Mercado -Ayala, an undergraduate student from the University of Puerto Rico, received training in nearly all aspects of forest pathology and fungal genetics, from field sampling, to isolating pure cultures of N. ditissima from field samples, to DNA extractions and PCR -amplifying microsatellite loci. Impact: Due to its increasing abundance in Connecticut, black birch is a tree of growing importance and concern. Although trees infected with Perennial Canker can persist for decades, the extensive scarring caused by the cankers renders them of little value for lumber or veneer . Our efforts to more fully understand the biology and natural history of N. ditissima is an important contribution in the fields of mycology and evolutionary biology, and will contribute to the identification and utilization of control strategies. An important result of this research is that they are the first to demonstrate, in a fungus, empirical support for theoretical models that posit the importa nce of biparental inbreeding to the evolutionary stability of mixed mating . Can nanoparticles be effective for treatment of vascular wilt diseases of trees? Great promise has been shown in the use of nanoparticles for delivery of metallic oxides and other compounds to crop plants to enhance growth and protect against disease . However, this technology has yet to be used in the treatment of tree diseases. The current treatment for Dutch Elm Disease (DED), a deadly vascular wilt caused by the fungus, Oph iostoma novo- ulmi, involves the prophylactic injection of fungicide (usually tebuconazole) into trees every 1 -3 years. Although O. novo- ulmi is highly sensitive to copper, phytotoxicity issues have precluded its use in conventional treatments such as spray s. However, phytotoxicity has not been an issue when copper has been delivered via nanoparticle formulations for treatment in other pathosystems. Dr. Marra has planted an orchard of 50 American elms ( Ulmus americana) and 50 the CAES Lockwood Farm in Hamden, CT, which will be used in experiments testing the efficacy of prophylactic injections of copper and other metal -oxide The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 156 nanoparticle formulations for both DED and sapstreak of sugar maples caused by the vascular wilt fungus , Ceratocystis virescens. 8 : Lockwood in Hamden, CT . The trees, started from wild-collected seed, are enclosed within \"tree tubes,\" which protect from harsh winter weather as well as from deer, and bark -chewing rabbits and rodents. Impact: Both Sapstreak and Dutch Elm disease cost millions every year. Once trees are infected, there is little effective management strategy . Nanoparticles may offer a new method for distributing anti - microbials through the vasculature of the tree . Erwinia nucleobase Schultes is studying Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of a devastating disease of apples and pears called fire blight. Fire blight is causes large losses in apple and pear production and is a major disease for commercial farmers. Like other bacteria, E. amylovora has a panel of membrane localized transporters that import nitrogen rich purines and pyrimidines from the environment - effectively increasing the growth potential . Dr. Schultes objectives are: 1) to determining the function and biochemical properties of nucleobase cation symporter 2 (NCS2) transporters from E. amylovora; 2) det ermine if these transporters can move the toxic purine derivative, 6 -thioguanine, that E. amylovora synthesizes and excretes; 3) determine if these transporters contribute to pathogen establishment on the host. We have determined the function of the uracil transporter, guanine -hypoxanthine transporter, adenine transporter and xanthine transporter through heterologous complementation in E. coli strains deficient for endogenous nucleobase transporters. Only the guanine -hypoxanthine transporter is capable of t ransporting 6- thioguanine. We have also generated specific gene deletion -insertion mutations in the E. amylovora genes encoding for the guanine -hypoxanthine, adenine and uracil transporters . These mutant E. amylovora lines were compared with wile type E. a mylovora line Ea1189 in immature pear pathogenicity tests and determined that the re is no difference in disease establishment of pathogenicity . Impact: Comprehending how Erwinia amylovora the derivative - 6 thio- guanine - in disease establishment will contribute to devising new strategies for fire blight control. The 157 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 research is conducted by Dr. Neil Schultes and a colleague Dr. George Mourad at the Dept. of Biology at Indiana University - Purdue University Ft. Wayne, IN. Inves tigating the role of the Xanthomonas effector AvrRxo1 as a toxin -antitoxin system. Drs. Triplett and Shidore, along with collaborators at Colorado State University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute have discovered that Xanthomonas pathogens, including those causing bacterial spot of tomato and pepper in Connecticut, secrete a previously unknown type of protein toxin that can alter central metabolism in bacteria, fungi, and plants. Dr. Triplett demonstrated that the toxin is a new ty pe of universal \"poison\" that directly alters a central metabolite in plant cells during infection to suppress immunity, and that this likely works by changing the oxidative environment inside the cell rather than through toxicity. In the past year, in col laboration with Dr. Christina Robb, Dr. Triplett began studies toward the long -term goal of determining how the toxin is recognized by certain plant resistance genes. Impact: This finding greatly expands our understanding of the ways in which bacteria ca n directly harm both plant and human hosts. This family of toxic proteins targets rapidly growing cells, and has been investigated toward harnessing its antibacterial and antifungal potential, but was never previously shown to be a weapon in pathogenesis. The characterization of how this new type of bacterial toxin is recognized will help us find new strategies to fight disease, and the toxin may also have uses in biomedical and synthetic biology research. The contribution of toxin- antitoxin systems to bac terial plant disease. Drs. Lindsay Triplett and Quan Zeng, along with Dr. Teja Shidore, have continued identifying the roles of numerous different toxin- antitoxin systems in bacterial plant disease. Genomic analysis was continued, which has helped us under stand the potential roles of these mysterious genes in different pathogen strategies. This year Dr. Shidore characterized the role of six TA systems in the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora, a significant disease in Connecticut orchards, and showed that one system was required for persistence of E. amylovora to the antibiotic spray streptomycin. All six systems suppressed the virulence capabilities of E. amylovora in some way, suggesting novel roles for these systems in regulation of virulence. Impact : In addition to being virulence factors, toxin- antitoxin systems are thought to play a major role in bacterial survival of antibiotics and survival in the host, making it difficult to eradicate disease in an area. Discovering which ones are important will tell us which ones to target for disease control strategies, and which ones could be used to improve biocontrol strains for improved survival. Identification of a novel Xanthomonas disease resistance mechanism shared by rice and tomato. In the past two years Dr. Lindsay Triplett along with collaborators at Yale, Colorado State, and Cornell University discovered and mapped the genetic location of a new type of broad- spectrum resistance gene in rice. Candidate genes were identified and candidate interactor s were found. This year, we performed genome sequencing of the rice variety with the trait and assessment of other varieties, revealing possible features that are essential for resistance. We also discovered that a tomato resistance gene can recognize the same pathogen trigger as the rice gene, and have identified new minimal requirements in this molecular pattern. We are working on confirming the gene's identity and determining how it detects the target protein from pathogens. Impact: This is the first e ffective genetic resistance against a pathogen that causes up to $1 billion in annual yield loss in West African rice, and has been labeled a security threat to US rice. The resistance gene is a novel type of resistance found in both monocot and dicot plants, and it is triggered by a protein found in 60% of Xanthomonas and many Ralstonia plant pathogens. Once the mechanism of resistance is identified, it could be harnessed for resistance against a wide variety of crop diseases. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 158 Nanoparticle effects on Chry santhemum Wilt: An approach to incorporate undergraduate training into original field research Dr. Lindsay Triplett and collaborators at Southern Connecticut State University completed the first year of a USDA -funded project to train the next generation of the agricultural workforce through undergraduate research experiences. As part of this project, ten undergraduate students participated in a group research project aimed at determining the effect of nanoparticle treatments on a fungal wilt disease of Chry santhemums. Students participated in plot design, planting, disease inoculation, taking three types of plant health measurement, and analyzing data. The first year yielded publishable data indicating that nanoparticle treatments significantly affected Chry santhemum growth and disease development. The project was prepared along with Dr. Wade Elmer and maintained by Mr. Peter Thiel and farm Staff. Figure 9 USDA funded interns preparing soil for chrysanthemum - nanoparticle research at the Lockwood farm. Impact: Chrysanthemum wilt is a significant problem of Chrysanthemum, which represents a $124 million market in the United States. The disease can be lethal and is currently only treated with fungicide drenches. Nanoparticles may represent a better alternative for control of root diseases. Second, although field research skills are strongly needed on the job market, there are currently extremely few opportunities nationwide for meaningful undergraduate training in agricultural field research. This project will expose 30 undergraduate students to participation in a complete field project, and will generate pedagogical resources used to increase opportunities for future students. Fire Blight Pathogen Erwinia amylovora Transmission in North America and Europe Erwinia amylovora is the causal agent of fire blight, one of the most devastating diseases of apple and pear. Erwinia amylovora is thought to have originated in North America and has now spread to at least 50 countries worldwide. An understanding of the diversity of the pathogen population and the transmission to different geographical regions is important for the future mitigation of this disease. In this research, Dr. Zeng performed an expanded comparative genomic study of the Spiraeoideae infecting (SI) E. amylovora population in North America and Europe. We discovered that, although still highly homogeneous, the genetic diversity of 30 E. amylovora genomes examined was about 30 times higher than previously determined. These isolates belong to four disti nct clades, three of which display geographical clustering and one of which contains strains from various geographical locations ('Widely Prevalent' clade). Furthermore, we revealed that strains from the Widely Prevalent clade displayed a higher level of recombination with strains from a clade strictly from the eastern USA, which suggests that the Widely Prevalent clade probably originated from the eastern USA before it spread to other locations. Finally, we detected variations in virulence in the SI E. amylovora strains on immature pear, and identified the genetic basis of one of the low virulence strains as being caused by a single nucleotide polymorphism in hfq, a gene encoding an important virulence regulator. 159 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Figure 10. Genome comparison of Erwinia amylovora isolates from North America (top five genom es) and Europe (bottom genome). Impact: Our results provide insights into the population structure, distribution and evolution of SI E. amylovora in North America and Europe. It provides indication that transporting plant materials may facilitate the transmission of plant diseases. Using a Genome -Based PCR Primer Prediction Pipeline to Develop Molecular Diagnostics for the Turfgrass Pathogen Acidovorax avenae Creeping bentgrass is one of the most comm only used grass species on golf course putting greens in the United States. Since 2009, grass decline with symptoms of wilting, necrosis, and etiolation were consistently observed on creeping bentgrass of many golf courses in the \"transition zone\" of the U nited States. Later the causal agent of this disease was diagnosed as a bacterial pathogen Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae (Aaa) and the disease is named as bacterial etiolation and decline (BED). However, how this disease emerged and spread to different p arts of the U.S. was unknown. Dr. Zeng, in collaboration with Dr. Paul Giordano, employed a novel alignment -free primer prediction pipeline to design diagnostic primers for turfgrass pathogenic A. avenae using 15 draft genomes of closely related target an d non- target Acidovorax as input. Twenty candidate primer sets specific to turfgrass pathogenic A. avenae were designed. The specificity and sensitivity of these primer sets were validated via a traditional PCR and a real- time PCR assay. Primer sets 0017 and 0019 coupled with an internal oligo probe showed optimal sensitivity and specificity when evaluated with the target pathogen, closely related bacterial species and microorganisms that inhabit the same host and soil environment. Finally, the accuracy of the newly developed real -time PCR assay was evaluated to detect BED pathogens from BED symptomatic and asymptomatic turfgrass samples. The diagnostic results produced by the real - time PCR assay were consistent with results of a cultural -based method. This assay will allow quicker and more effective detection of the BED pathogen thus potentially reducing misdiagnoses and unnecessary usage of fungicides. Impact: Golf industry is an important component of the economy in the United States and Connecticut. The total size of Connecticut's golf economy was estimated at $638 million in 2008. The diagnostic assay developed can provide rapid and accurate response regarding this disease on golf courses. The Influence of Flower Anatomy and Apple Cultivar on the Apple Flower Phytobiome. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 160 Dr. Zeng has been characterizing the microbial communities (microbiome) on apple flowers . Apple flowers represent the primary infection sites of fire blight . Pathogen friendly ecological conditions on apple flowers are critical for the occurrence of fire blight infection. Apple flowers are the main targets of biological control agents. Despite the importance of apple flowers, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the microbial composition, diversity, abundance on apple flowers. This knowledge gap directly resulted in the lack of biocontrol agents that can provide consistent, high level of protection against fire blight . In this research, stigmas, stamens, receptacles, and petals were dissected from flowers, and the microbiome of each structure was characterized. Each flower part harbored a largely overlapping set of bacterial taxa, predominantly within the groups Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. However, the structure of the communities differed. The stigmas showed a high dominance of a small number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 97% sequence identity) whereas OTUs on petals were more even in relative abundance. Results from the OTU analysi s of phytobiomes from stigmas from three apple cultivars, Braeburn, MacIntosh, and Sunrise, indicated cultivar did not significantly influence community structure. Correlation analysis of bacterial taxa in the apple phytobiome found a negative correlation between Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae, suggesting a potential niche exclusion relationship between these taxa. In this respect, the phytobiome of the apple flower is relatively simple but different flower parts, particularly the stigma, enrich the rel ative abundance of specific bacterial populations. Correlations in the community structure point to potential antagonistic relationships, which could be used to manipulate the structure of the microbiome for biocontrol of pathogens or other orchard managem ent strategies. Impact: The management of fire blight is challenged by the spread of streptomycin resistance in the pathogen population. While the streptomycin is less useful in fire blight management, alternative control measures have yet been developed . In Connecticut, most growers still heavily rely on the streptomycin spray . This not only puts the growers at the risk of control failure in case of resistance, but also significantly limits the organic tree fruit production in CT, as antibiotics are no l onger allowed in organic production after 2014. Thus, effective, environmental friendly options for fire blight control is urgently needed in CT. Understand How Bacteria Pathogens Respond to Host Signals and Modulate Virulence Expression. As single cell organisms, bacteria multiply through asexual replication. A bacterial population formed by genetic replication consists of billions of single cells with identical genetic background. When perceive an environmental signal, these single cells often respond uniformly by producing a related gene product evenly in each individual cell of the population. However, under certain adverse, fluctuating environments, bacteria sometimes express a gene in a \"non -uniform\" manner in a population. Dickeya dad antii is a bacterial plant pathogen that causes soft rot disease on a wide range of host plants. The type III secretion system (T3SS) is an important virulence factor in D. dadantii . Expression of the T3SS is induced in the plant apoplast or in hrp- inducing minimal medium (hrp -MM), and is repressed in nutrient - Figure 11 . Anatomy of apple flower investigated in the microbiome study. Figure 12 . Bacterial colonization (top, represented by GFP) and their corresponding virulence gene expression (bottom, represented by mCherry) of D. dadantii in potato. 161 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 rich media. Despite the understanding of induction conditions, how individual cells in a clonal bacterial population respond to these conditions and modulate T3SS expression is not well understood. In our previous study, we reported that in a clonal population, only a small proportion of bacteria highly expressed T3SS genes while the majority of the population did not express T3SS genes under hrp- MM condition. In this study, we developed a method that enabled in situ observation and quantification of gene expression in single bacterial cells in planta. Using this technique, we observed that the expression of the T3SS genes hrpA and hrpN is restricted to a small proportion of D. dadantii cells during the infection of potato. We also report that the expression of T3SS genes is higher at early stages of infection compared to later stages. This expression modulation is achieved through adjusting the ratio of T3SSON and T3SSOFF cells and the expression intensity of T3SSON cells. Our findings not only shed light into how bacteria use a bi -stable gene expression manner to modulate an important virulence factor, but also provide a useful tool to study gene expression in individual bacterial cells in planta . Impa ct: This study will significantly advance our knowledge on what additional strategies bacterial pathogens use to modulate the virulence gene expression during plant -pathogen interactions . In addition, this research will be performed in the context of two economically important bacteria plant diseases, thus findings from this research will also immediately benefit the U.S. agriculture by providing basic knowledge to guide the development of disease management strategies in the future. Disease Survey Dr. Yonghao Li diagnosed a wide range of fungal, bacterial, viral, nematode, and abiotic diseases on trees, shrubs, flowers, lawn grasses, fruits, and vegetables during the year 2017 -2018. The drought stress during the growing season past several years and dra matic fluctuating of winter temperatures resulted in severe winter injury and diebacks of woody ornamentals in 2018. Cool and wet spring weather conditions favored for many fungal and bacterial diseases on trees, shrubs, herbaceous ornamentals, fruits, and vegetables in the year 2017 -2018. Ornamentals: Root rot diseases were major problems on annual and perennial flowers in greenhouse and nursery production and landscapes, such as Pythium root rot on impatiens, Volutella blight pachysandra remained a major problem in ground cover ornamentals because of drought stress during the summer and wet spring weather . Powdery mildew and Botrytis blight wer e problematic on Botrytis blight was also found on rosemary . Alternaria leaf spot was found on zinnia. Significant diebacks and browning of needles on Eastern red cedar were noticed statewide, which might be attributed by drought stress and mild/ex treme cold winter temperatures in past few years. In several Christmas tree farms, severe wilting and diebacks of new growth were observed, but the causing agents this phenomenon haven't been confirmed. Rhizosphaera needlecast and Stigmina foliar diseases on spruce. Phytophthora root rot was detected on Fraser fir in many Christmas tree farms . Pestalotiopsis needle blight was prevalent in arborvitae, which might be associated with drought stress and winter injury on the trees. Fabr ella needle cast of hemlock was found in a landscape. Boxwood blight was continuously problematic in both landscapes and nurseries . Thirty -five boxwood blight incidences were confirmed in landscapes between August and October in 2017. Boxwood blight was al so confirmed in a commercial nursery in the spring of 2018. Winter injury, Volutella canker and Macrophoma leaf spot were major contributors of severe diebacks of boxwood in landscapes . Gymnosporangium rust diseases were prevalent on apple, pear, quince, s erviceberry, hawthorn, and cedar . The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 162 Many fungal canker diseases were found on woody ornamentals, such as Phomopsis canker on Japanese maple, holly, and identified on arcuba. Uncommon foliar diseases were identified this year, which includes Phyllosticta leaf spot of azalea, downy spot of hickory, and Cercospore leaf spot of Figure 14 . Botryosphaeria canker of arcuba (Left); (Right). Figure 13 . Browning of eastern red cedar needles (left) and Fabrella needle cast of hemlock (right). 163 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Vegetables: Septoria leaf spot remained the most common disease problem of tomato. Stemphylium gray leaf spot was found in field- -grown tomato plants . and blossom -end rot were common diseases in garden- and field -grown tomatoes . Bacterial pith necrosis and Botrytis ghost spot were found in several commercial production tomato fields and greenhouses, respectively . On peppers, bacterial leaf spot and Phytophthora blight were problematic . Powdery mildew, anthracnose, and downy were major disease on cucurbit crops . Verticillium wilt and Phomopsis blight were found on eggplant . Basil downy mildew was found in late summer . White r ot and anthracnose were two major diseases on garlic. Pythium root rot was an emerging disease of hydroponic -grown lettuce. Fruit: Cedar -apple rust, scab, frogeye leaf spot, and black rot were prevalent on apple trees. Marssonina leaf spot of apple was found in an orchard 2017. On pear trees, rust and Fabraea leaf spot were found . Leaf curl and brown rot continued to be major diseases on peach. Brown rot and winter injury caused significant tip diebacks on cherry and plum trees. Rust was frequently detected on fig trees. Severe epidemics of black rot resulted in significant yield losses of grapes in home gardens and commercial fields. Powdery mildew, downy mi ldew, and anthracnose . Botrytis blight was also found on . Downy spot of hickory (Left); Cercospora l eaf spot of linden tree (Right). Figure 16 . Marssonina leaf spot of apple (Left); Black rot of grape (Right). The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 164 Turf: Widespread of dollar spot of law n grass was reported, which might be contributed by wet and humid weather conditions in the summer of 2018. Brown patch, summer patch, red thread, anthracnose, and rust were common diseases of lawn grasses. Many cases of Pythium blight, Drechslera leaf spo t, and Bipolaris leaf spot were found in lawns that were frequently irrigated and over -fertilized . Weeds: Poison ivy and oriental bittersweet remained significant problems in residential properties. Running bamboo continued to be a topic of increasing public concern because it is difficult to control and has the potential for causing problems between neighbors . Crabgrass, annual blue grass, bittercress, nutsedge, purslane, red sorrel, wild garlic, and wild violets were major weed problems in turf grasses. Other common weeds were Asiatic dayflower, sumac. Impact: Information of disease survey in Connecticut landscapes, greenhouses, nurseries, vegetable fields, orchards, natural woodlots, forests, and home properties each year helps to monitor and assess the impact of these problems on the overall health of plants in the state. This information also assists in detecting new diseases or in identifying potentially important emerging diseases on specific plants, which can then be monitored in the years that follow. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Members of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology are involved in a wide range of service and public outreach activities . Some of these services involve presentations, publications, displays at meetings and other outreach events, tours of facilities, and interviews, in addition to being conducted in cooperation with other state agencies. Seed Testing: In Cooperation with the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Regulation and Inspection Every year, official samples of vegetable, crop, and lawn grass seeds are collected by inspectors from the Bureau of Regulation and Inspection of the Connecticut Department of Agriculture and submitted to The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, an official seed testing laboratory for Connecticut, for seed purity and germination tests . In 2018, a total of 321 seed samples including 210 vegetable, 15 lawn grass, and 6 crop seed samples were submitted to Dr. Li for testing . Germination and purity analys es have been Figure 17. Alternaria leaf spot of zinnia (Left); Dollar spot of lawn grass (Right) 165 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 performed by complying with Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act and by following strict protocols designated by the Association of Official Seed Analysts . As of the date of this report, tests for 210 of the 321 vegetable samples, 12 of 15 grass samples, and all 6 crop samples were completed. The final result will be analyzed and the report will be submitted to the CT Department of Agriculture and published in the Station website. Impact: Results of seed tests conducted by Station staff are reported to the Seed Control Official of the CT Department of Agriculture who has the authority to stop the sale of products that do not meet label claims or contain noxious weeds . In the short term, this program protects state residents from purchasing inferior seed and ensures that seeds comply with the Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act . The long -term benefit of the seed testing program is to minimize the unintentional introduction of noxious weed seeds that coul d potentially impact crops of economic importance and the state's ecosystem. Samples for Analytical Chemistry and the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection During the year, Dr. Li examined 24 samples from the Connecticut Department of Consumer Pro tection at the request of the Department of Analytical Chemistry at the Experiment Station. Citizen Inquiries Plant Disease Information Office Dr. Li answered 4,093 inquiries about plant and plant health from Connecticut citizens . The majority of inquirie s were on ornamentals, trees, and shrubs (69%), Inquiries about food crops (13%) and turf grasses (4%), were also well represented . A moderate percentage of inquiries fell into the miscellaneous category (14%), which included identification of various plants and weeds, mushroom identification for health officials, and information about pesticides and their relationships to health and environmental concerns. The majority of inquiries were from Connecticut homeowners (56%) . The inquiries from commercial growe rs and plant care professionals (38%) were increased 4% this year . Six percent of inquiries were from cooperative extension, health, news, municipals, garden clubs, and other organizations . A further breakdown of inquiries showed that 27% of the questions came in by phone, 18% came in by mail, 16% came as email, and 39% were brought in person . A total of 1,954 physical samples were examined by Dr. Li and the other 2,139 inquiries were handled through phone calls, emails, and visitor's inquiries without samp les. Dr. Li responded 1,575 inquiries via letters and email messages with attached files of fact sheets, which was 54% higher than that in last year. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 166 VALLEY LABORATORY Scientists at the Valley Laboratory conduct research on insects, diseases, soil nutr ition, mycology, integrated pest management and weeds of concern to commercial agriculture and homeowners in Connecticut . The Valley Laboratory, located in Windsor, was originally established by the Board of Control in 1921 to conduct tobacco research. While research on tobacco continues today, the research mission has expanded to reflect the diverse agriculture present in the State. Scientists and staff also diagnose insect and plant health problems, test soils for fertility, conduct outreach to growers an d homeowners by speaking to professional and community groups, host informational meetings, and assist municipalities, state agencies, and students. Activities on the Farm There were a total of 50 experimental plots at the Windsor research farm during the past year . Four Windsor -based scientists had 3 8 of these plots; five New Haven -based scientists were using 1 2 plots . Additional plots were maintained by the Farm Manager as rotation crops or for seed collection . Valley Laboratory scientists also conducted experiments in many plots off site, such as in growers' fields, the Lockwood and Griswold farms and in State forests . Valley Laboratory Farm Manager James Preste kept the farm and equipment ready and in excellent shape . He expertly maintained the many field plots and addressed the specific needs of each scientist . He and his summer research assistants did an outstanding job maintaining the extensive ornamental garden in cooperation with the Connect icut Nursery and Landscape Association . Mr. Preste and Dr. LaMondia coordinated the Valley Laboratory effort to comply with EPA Worker Protection Standards for Agricultural Pesticides and organized and conducted safety and pesticide training sessions for t he staff. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Research Biological control using imported predators of Adelges tsugae , the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) is a major long -term national strategy for reducing the impact and spread of this damaging and invasive insect which threatens the entire range of eastern and Carolina hemlocks. Sasajiscymnus tsugae (Coleoptera:Coccinellidae), originating from Honshu, Japan, discovered and studied at the CAES, is one of the first biological control agents released f or HWA management in the US and the only major species released in Connecticut . From 1995 -2007 >176,000 S. tsugae were mass reared and released in 26 state forest and parks, municipal, water company and private forest sites throughout Connecticut . Encourag ing results of hemlock recovery from HWA damage in Connecticut were recorded from 2005 -2009 in >75% of sites with S. tsugae releases. The overall goals of this project are to integrate established and new approaches, into (1) an overall current assessment of the health of forest hemlocks in Connecticut, 30 years after the arrival of HWA, and (2) to improve the understanding of the role of climate and biological control of HWA with the introduced adelgid predator, S. tsugae . S. tsugae remains the only biolog ical control agent for HWA available commercially due to ability for large scale laboratory rearing . Current assessments are evaluating the implementation of S. tsugae to manage HWA infestations as an important and economical option for public and private stakeholders who cannot or do not want to use chemicals for controlling HWA . These assessments quantify predation of HWA under hot humid summer conditions. Assessments of the field efficacy of S. tsugae as a biological control agent documented many advant ageous attributes for a second year in 2017. S. tsugae males and females are effective HWA predators under variable ambient environmental conditions, feeding on HWA from late spring through fall. Following continuous HWA predation in summer 2016, one of the hottest summers on record, female and male S. tsugae again fed weekly on HWA stages continuously from late June to October 2017 167 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 during field experiments conducted at the Valley Laboratory, Windsor . July and August 2017 were on average 5\u00b0F cooler than in 2016, which prolonged the duration of the HWA summer progrediens generation . Correspondingly, females had a longer oviposition season in synchrony with the developing progrediens generation. Adult females and males both fed on an average of 62-98 progrediens nymphs and adults over a 3 -week period while larvae also feed on the same, further increasing predatory impact on the second HWA progrediens generation. Adults also uniquely feed continuously through the hot summer but do not oviposit on dormant HWA N1 settlers of the subsequent sistens generation . During the cooler summer of 2017, S. tsugae females and males consumed >1000 - 1100 HWA sistens N1 each from July to late October, rates which were comparable to that in 2016. During a warmer than nor mal (by 6\u00b0F) October in 2017, several females oviposited on developing sistens nymphs, although the eggs did not survive a sudden deep freeze in mid -November when overnight temperatures reached 19 \u00b0F at Windsor . Adult S. tsugae survived the cold snap well . However, if fall temperatures continue to trend warmer without abrupt freezes, S. tsugae may be able to complete another generation in milder areas. These field experiments document that S. tsugae is able to survive the variable, increasingly hot and humi d summers and fall, adapting to the changing climate in Connecticut . Furthermore, S. tsugae is commercially reared and available to the public for biological control and should be released to control HWA in spring especially after mild winters . In some protected areas near the coast, S. tsugae could also be released strategically in low numbers to target HWA survivors after extreme winters which can significantly kill off large numbers of HWA. Impact: S. tsugae is a commercially available biological contr ol that can survive Connecticut climate conditions and aid in hemlock wooly adelgid control. HWA Winter Mortality in 2018 The winter of 2017- 2018 started with one of the coldest 2 weeks in late December into early January with devastating wind chills of -10 to -30\u00b0F in the first week of January 2018. Winter sampling and counts of HWA mortality from 16 sites throughout Connecticut were conducted in February and March and the results showed that there was high HWA mortality throughout most of the state but not of the magnitude of 2015 and 2016. Mean HWA winter mortality throughout the state was 88.4% . In the Northwest (climate division 1), normally the coldest region of the state, minimum daily temperatures plunged to - 8 and - 10\u00b0F but HWA mortality was variab le as HWA may be showing greater cold tolerance in some areas such as Norfolk . Mean HWA winter mortality in Division 1 was 84.7% . In the Central region of the state (climate division 2), HWA mortality was the highest, at 91.5%, with the highest mortalities in the north. Minimum daily temperatures ranged from -7 to - 16\u00b0F (near the northeastern MA border) . In areas near the coast (climate division 3), HWA winter mortality was reduced in 2018 with a mean of 88.5% . Minimum daily temperatures ranged widely from - 2\u00b0F in Bridgeport, - 6\u00b0F in interior Bridgeport to - 11\u00b0F in Stamford. Minimum temperature in New Haven was 0\u00b0F. Impact: HWA winter mortality can be predicted based on temperature and climate division and may preclude the need for management. Releases of S. tsugae in 2018 In response to the public interest in potential biological control with S. tsugae , a small release of the predator was implemented at the end of May 2018 in cooperation with the Board of Edgerton Park Conservancy, and the City of New Haven Department of Parks, Recreation and Trees, as an experiment. Edgerton Park Conservancy, a historic and beautiful New Haven public park, has stunning vistas and garden landscapes which provide a peaceful retreat and is located near the CAES . Hemlocks there have been treated twice annually with horticultural oil sprays for HWA and elongate hemlock scale control . Although these treatments are very effective in killing these hemlock pests, complete coverage is unfeasible and occasionally a few adelgids survive the sprays. It is hoped that these ladybeetle predators will survive and establish to control HWA refugia at Edgerton Park. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 168 George Jones, Jenny Byers and Diane Holsenbeck, Edgerton Park Conservancy Board members, releasing Sasajiscymnus tsugae at Edgerton Park The extended extreme drought of 2015- 2017 lasted 22 months in Coastal climatic division 3, 18 months in Central climatic division 2 and 11 months in Northwestern climatic division 1, as determined by the Northeast Regional Climate Center at Cornell University . The extended drought in Connecticut officially ended in April 2017 and heavy rains and cool temperatures in spring and early summer had favored dramatic hemlock refoliation and recovery statewide during the summer of 2017. 15 S. tsugae release sites were revisited to assess hemlock crown health ratings one year later post drought in early spring 2018 at 15 of Connecticut's older S. tsugae release sites . The increased precipitation had triggered tremendous reflush of new growth in hemlocks at almost all sites visited in the summer of 2017, somewhat counteracting needle loss due to drought impacts in many areas. Even in poor sites, individual trees showed very good recovery: 169 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Steep Rock Association, Washington Sep 2016.......May 2017 May 2018 However, extreme wind chills of - 20 to -30 F in early January 2018, exacerbated by delayed impacts from the extreme drought, may have result ed in dramatic unexpected needle loss in some release sites, especially in parts of the central and the northeast part of CT. These effects of extreme winter desiccation have not been recorded by this researcher before. By the banks of the Salmon River 2018 The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 170 Mashamoquet Brook State Park, Pomfret May 2017...and May 2018 Mashamoquet Brook State Park, Pomfret May 2017...and May 2018 2016 hemlock health assessments had shown that hemlocks in some marginal release sites ex hibited heavy decline on northeast and northeast ridges, due to heavy EHS infestations, in either single or joint infestations with HWA, exacerbated by native hemlock borer attacks. In 2016 ratings, a third of sites had heavy hemlock borer outbreaks on roc ky ridgetops with thin soils but no significant new tree mortality was recorded in 2017 season assessments. It is possible resumption of rains allowed adjacent hemlocks to resist further borer attack . HWA levels continued to be significantly depressed in m any sites due to another severe winter in 2018. Recent severe winters have not greatly reduced elongate hemlock scale (EHS) Fiorinia externa infestations . The scale has continued to encroach on high elevation hemlock stands in northwestern CT. However, th e most severe and prolonged drought since 1964- 66, together with heavy EHS infestations at some sites resulted in rapid tree decline and thin hemlock crowns, especially in marginal sites on stressed ridge tops in the northern half of the state . Many perenn ial and feeder streams were dried up in the fal l of 2016 and winter of 2017. Extensive needle drop of scale infested foliage in 2017 resulting in extreme decline of stressed hemlocks although also resulting in a drop in EHS levels in some sites. 171 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Hemlock mortality due to hemlock borer infestations in northern Connecticut Implementation of Biological Control of Mile -a-Minute Weed in Connecticut Mile -a-minute weed, Persicaria perfoliata, (MAM) originates from Asia, was first discovered in eastern U.S. in the 1930s and is classified as a serious invasive weed in Connecticut . Infestations are found in 14 eastern states from North Carolina to Ohio and the first record of MAM in Connecticut was in Greenwich in 1997, later confirmed in 2000. As of June 2018, 49 towns in Connecticut have confirmed reports of MAM, with Chester and East Lyme as the latest towns confirmed in 2018 (https://mam.uconn.edu/distribution/ ). Several towns have only limited reports o f a few plants which have since been removed . This rapidly growing prickly and prolific vine is annual in its northern range but quickly forms dense thickets which overwhelm and displace native vegetation and reduces plant diversity . An introduced weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), imported from central China, has been successfully reared and released for biological control of this invasive species in the Mid - Atlantic and southern New England states . This project is a collaboration b etween the CAES and Donna Ellis, Senior Extension Educator at the University of Connecticut and is funded by USDA APHIS PPQ, in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Agriculture Phillip Alampi Beneficial Insect Laboratory . Many volunteers and coope rators from the private sector work together with our team, other state, town and federal officials in a team effort to implement MAM biological contro l to limit the spread of MAM. Dr. Cheah and Donna Ellis have collaborated on the releases and monitoring of all the release sites since 2009. Emmett Varricchio, summer research assistant at the Valley Laboratory, continued a third season in 2017, with GIS mapping of MAM and weevil dispersal, assisting in the release of weevils and conducting extensive scoutin g for MAM spread and weevil dispersal. Releases of R. latipes began in 2009 in Connecticut, and to date, 55,624 weevils have been released in 25 towns as of June 2018. In June 2018, 2,000 weevils were released at 2 new sites: a school playing field in the town of Washington and at a private property in the town of Westport. Weevils were also added to a 2017 island site, Sheffield Island, part of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge, with the assistance and cooperation of Wildlife Biologist Kri s Vagos and NWR interns, and Charles Baker, USDA APHIS PPQ . This project has documented the continued successful establishment and wide spread of this phytophagous insect species in southern New England.

McKinney Wildlife Refuge, with Charles Baker (APHIS PPQ) and NWR su mmer interns, releasing weevils on Sheffield Island, Norwalk, 2018 Emmett Varricchio, CAES Windsor, Adult weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes on MAM recording data at a MAM weevil release site in 2017 Forty -nine CT towns were recorded with confirmed reports of MAM to date in June 2018 (https://mam.uconn.edu/distribution/ ) with weevils released in 25 towns to date. Monitoring in 2017 showed the weevils' continued p resence at all sites, very late maturation of fruit, reduction of MAM at some sites. For the third successive year, intensive scouting in adjacent areas, open space, town and state lands around release sites have shown little or no spread of MAM. Weevils h ave overwintered successfully again in Connecticut following successive severe winters in 2018 . Weevils have now survived severe flooding, drought, storms, variable winters, site interference from mowing, tree felling, vegetation clearance and herbicide tr eatments. This marks the 9th year of successful weevil overwintering and establishment . Establishment and spread of the weevils has also occurred in the majority of release sites in a variety of different habitats on the mainland and to offshore islands in Long Island Sound. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 174 Impact: Establishment of R. latipes for mile -a-minute weed appears to have limited the spread of mile- a- minute vine in some towns, together with other cultural and chemical means of control. Biological control of MAM is reducing the need for chemical control, especially in watershed areas, in utility right- of ways, agricultural lands, bird refuges etc. Augmentative Biological Control of Elongate Hemlock Scale Elongate hemlock scale, Fiorinia externa (EHS), an exotic scale present in Connecticut since the 1960s, has recently rapidly expanded its range and population densities to seriously damaging levels on forest and landscape hemlocks over much of Connecticut in the past 5 years . Forest stands in no rthern and western Connecticut with heavy elongate hemlock scale infestations have shown thinning crowns and declining health, leading to pre -emptive hemlock salvage in forest management . Recently, the native species, Abgrallaspis ithacae , or the hemlock s cale, has increased in abundance in south western and central parts of Connecticut on forest hemlocks while it has also been seriously damaging Christmas tree plantations for at least the past 3 years. As EHS and hemlock scale also infests other conifers, especially firs, which are the most popular species for Christmas trees, the industry is impacted and mostly resorts to chemical control for management of scale outbreaks. There is no effective natural enemy of EHS in North America . However, the twice -stabbed lady beetle, Chilocorus stigma, is a native and widespread omnivorous scale predator . But there have been no attempts to mass- rear C. stigma and it is not available commercially . The goal of project is to develop optimal laboratory methods to mass rea r suitable scale cultures and C. stigma for potential augmentative and safe biological control releases in EHS -affected stands. Chilocorus stigma continued to be reared on a small scale through the fourth generation on Florida red scale, Chrysomphalus aoni dum (FRS) on butternut squash in 2017. Butternut squash were grown and provided by Farm Manager James Preste at the CAES Farm in Windsor and stored at the CAES Griswold Farm with Farm Manager, Robert Durgy's help, and this has been a critical improvement f or operations in 2017. Impact: Currently there is no effective non- chemical control of elongate hemlock scale and the range is expanding northwards into Maine . Development of novel mass rearing procedures for C. stigma, a safe, omnivorous, climatically -adapted native predator of EHS, would allow implementation into new areas, augment local forest populations and also provide a method of biological control for many scale pests in plantations and orchards and reduce pesticide usage. Insect Management Efforts to better quantify the potential for neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) for causing harm to pollinators requires an understanding of the concentration of these insecticides in floral rewards (nectar and pollen), the sensitivity of pollinators to the ins ecticides (known as intrinsic toxicity), the quantity of the pollen or nectar collected by the pollinators, and the duration of time that the pollinator may be exposed. 'PJM' cultivar rhododendrons were drenched or sprayed with low and high labeled rates o f five systemic insecticides, two of which are newly available to the ornamental horticulture industry . The concentrations of insecticides from pollen and nectar collected in 2018 and 2019 will be evaluated by Dr. Eitzer following that single treatment. A parallel experiment uses dahlias as a model plant to understand the dynamics in systemic insecticide movement into pollen from an herbaceous perennial during one growing season . These data will be of great value to establish best management practices for n ursery growers, and to determine whether these insecticides can be used in ways that are not likely to harm pollinators. Honey Bee Health Honey bee colonies have experienced poor overwintering survival in Connecticut for the past several years, with losse s each year of about 50% of hives . The chief suspect for poor honey bee health is varroa mite infestation . These mites not only weaken bees through direct parasitization, but also by transmitting 175 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 viral diseases within and between hives. A \"vicious cycle\" exists, in which colonies that have died during the winter are restocked by beekeepers during the spring by purchasing packages of bees. If these replacement queen bees have poor genetic traits and the colonies are also poorly managed for varroa mite infest ations, then the colony would be likely to die the next winter and have to be replaced. A two -year collaboration between Dr. Cowles and the CT State Bee Inspector, Mark Creighton, is being supported by the CT Department of Agriculture Specialty Crops Block Grant program. This project, initiated in 2017, addresses the needs of Connecticut beekeepers by starting a honey bee queen rearing and breeding program . The goal of this project is to obtain bees from exceptional commercial sources (based upon hygienic traits), and also from feral bee populations to use for production of queens to share with CT beekeepers. We evaluated honey bees from genetic improvement programs in other parts of the country, including \"Mite Biter\" bees from the Indiana Queen Breeders' Association, VSH (varroa sensitive hygiene) bees from a California breeding program, Russian bees from a national network of breeders, hygienic bees from Michael Palmer (a renowned Vermont beekeeper), and most recently, Saskatraz bees from a collaboration between Saskatchewan and California bee breeders. Russian bees were found to develop unacceptably high populations of varroa mites, the Palmer bees were not highly competitive, and some of the California bees were found to be highly aggressive. The most re liably gentle, healthy, and productive bees to date hav e been the \"Mite Biter\" bees. An additional potential source of survival genes for honey bees is from feral honey bee colonies, because, if they have survived for multiple years, they have done so without involvement of chemical treatments to manage mite populations . Feral bee swarms were trapped in Mohawk State Forest (northwest corner) and in Yale Myers Forest (northeast corner of CT). Based upon the success in trapping feral bees in 2017, feral bees are being trapped in a southeast to northwest transect in state forests near New England cottontail wildlife management areas, courtesy of permission from CT DEEP . In addition to trapping feral populations bee -lining techniques are being developed that should facilitate quantification of the numbers of colonies in forested areas of the state . Conventional beelining methods do not work in heavily forested areas, and so new methods - both for initial capture of worker bees and for identifying the location of their home colonies, are being developed. An added benefit from this project involves outreach to beekeepers, so that they gain a better understanding of the joint necessity for improving the hygienic traits carried by their queen bees and of the need to maintain varroa mites at low populations . Side benefits expected from these actions will be (1) state beekeepers will start to purchase or replace existing queens with hygienic bees, which will improve overall health and survival of the state's honey bee population, (2) the Connecticut Queen Breeders Association (founded in 2015) will have a \"jump start\" in terms of beekeeping supplies and breeding material for which they will become responsible, (3) the increasing proportion of bees with hygienic traits in the state may reach a threshold that increases the likelihood that open matings of bees will result in hygienic traits in the hive, and (4) better health for honey bees will improve the health of our native species of bees, because it will reduce the sharing of viruses from honey bees with other species on flowers that both species visit. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 176 Lifting and setting traps to collect feral bee colonies Impacts: Nursery growers indicate that they have become more cautious about using neonicotinoid insecticide s, or have discontinued their use. Connecticut beekeepers have expressed an intense interest in our bee breeding project, trapping of feral bees, and other practices to improve the health of their colonies . A leading beekeeper involved with preservation of \"survivor bees\" from structures in New England has initiated queen rearing from these colonies, to share with other beekeepers. Mycology Research Dr. DeWei Li conducts research on indoor molds of human health concern, fungal succession on water - damaged building materials, and infiltration of mushroom spores from outdoors into residences. A phylogenetic study of Harzia and allies with synanamorphic Proteophiala state or sexual connections: Multi -locus phylogeny of Harzia and allies were studied using i nternal transcribed spacer (ITS), large subunit rRNA (LSU), and small subunit (SSU) indicated reduced to synonymy of Harzia . The generic concept was amended and expanded accordingly . Eight new combinations were proposed. Melanospora and Sphaerodes are phylogenetically related to Harzia . The Proteophiala morph is not only a crucial morphological character, but also has a phylogenetical significance in defining Melanosporales. It is hypothesized that the taxa with synanamorphic or asexual Proteophiala all belong to Ceratostomataceae, Melanosporales. This is a collaboration with Neil Schultes, Dept . of Plant Pathology. Impact: The result of this study clarified the confusion in delineation of Harzia and allied genera . 177 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Maximum Likelihood analysis of Harzia and allied genera, including 70 taxa/isolates, based on concatenated sequence data of ITS, LSU and SSU. Xylaria hypoxylon is included as outgroup. The bootstrap test was conducted with 1000 replicates. Bootstrap values >50% were indicated by the nodes. The scale bar indicates the number of expected changes per site. T indicated the ex -types used in the analysis. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 178 Fungal taxonomic study This collaborative study with Neil Schultes and mycologists from several countries: Brazil, Canada, Cuba, China, Mexico, has led to discovery of four Nine new combinations were made also . These new species and genera have been published in four papers and the fifth one is in press . Among them, the article on Triadelphia is a monographic paper on the genus with detailed descriptions on all accepted species in the genus. For the taxa, from which cultures were isolated, both morphological and molecular methods were used for the study and their phylogenies were elucidated. Bactrodesmiastrum domesticum is an indoor fungus and found from water damaged wood in a residence in the USA . Triadelphia acericola was collected on the premises at Valley Laboratory. Impact: Discovery and descriptions of new fungal species add very important information for fungal diversity in the world and for the studies such as fungal ecological studies, in which fungi need to be identified . The newly described species add new information to fungal diversity, resour ces and conservation and utilization. Circinotrichum sinense (NHES L1703) a.

Several newly emerged diseases, walnut anthracnose diseases caused by Colletotrichum fructicola and C. siamense, and shoot blight on Chinese fir ( Cunninghamia lanceolata) caused by Bipolaris oryzae (Figure 3) were found and studied from both pathological, morphological and phylogenetic aspects . The study has led to three publications . This is a collaboration with several plant pathologists in China . Bipolaris o ryzae is a major rice pathogen, however it is reported for the first time its jumping from Graminae hosts to conifer. Impact: These new diseases are causing severe damage to farmers and forest . Determination and characterization of these pathogens are imp erative for disease management and future studies to fully understand the diseases for finding solutions to these diseases as well as how a phytopathogen evolved.

Weed Science Invasive Plant Management Trials Mugwort ( Artemisia vulgaris L.) is a highly invasive, non- native perennial plant that reproduces via rhizome as wel l as seed . Dense monotypic stands of mugwort are commonly found along roadsides, floodplains and riparian areas, pastures and rangelands, rights -of-way, and in various agronomic, turf and landscape settings. It is considered as one of the 10 most troubleso me weeds in the US nursery industry. Two field research projects are underway since fall 2016 at the Lockwood research farm, Hamden to evaluate mugwort ( Artemisia vulgaris ) response to herbicides and mowing regimes under enhanced levels of soil nitrogen. The first experiment included a factorial combination of three levels of nitrogen (0, 25, and 50 kg N/a) and three different rates of herbicides aminopyralid, clopyralid and glyphosate . The second experiment consisted of three different levels of nitrogen ( 0, 25, and 50 kg N/A) and three mowing schedules (7, 15, and 30 day intervals). The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 180 Mugwort management research A: floz/a with e xcellent mugwort control. Mugwort did not respond to the increased mowing frequency under any of the nitrogen fertilization levels. Intensive mowing at 7- day interval s (18 to 20 summer and fall mowings) over the last two years did not reduce mugwort rhizome biomass more than 20% . The results from chemical control trials revealed significant reduction in mugwort infestation with lower (0.5 x) than recommended (1 x) rates of aminopyralid and glyphosate herbicides . Glyphosate at 1.1kg ae/ha per hectare) and aminopyralid at 0.06 kg ae/ha resulted in 99 % visual control of mugwort . Lower rates of glyphosate at 0.55 kg ae/ha and aminopyralid at 0.03 kg a e/ha gave 65 and 85% visual control and reduction in mugwort rhizome biomass, respectively . Increased N fertilization did not affect mugwort control in response to any herbicide treatment . However, addition of nitrogen favorably affected perennial grasses. Ornamental Nursery Trials Weed management in ornamental plants is a highly challenging and costly production activity . Ornamental species as well as cultivars within a species differ widely in their tolerance to herbicides . Several ornamental plant safety and weed control efficacy trials are being conducted in multiple ornamental species that include: black -eyed and zinn ia. These studies will help in developing safe use practices for these new products and comparing their weed control efficacy and safety with the conventional pre -emergence herbicides. Ornamental plant safety trials at Valley Lab Wind sor, CT. Impact: The 2017 ornamental plant safety trials resulted in the discovery of many newer and safer chemical weed control options for sedum (biathlon and freehand 1.75 G at 200 and 300 lbs/a, A B A B 181 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 respectively), chocolate flower (freehand 1.75 G up to 600 lbs/a)), gladiolus (biathlon up to 400 lbs/a), flag iris (biathlon up to 400 lbs/a), and shasta daisy ((biathlon up to 200 lbs/a). Christmas Tree Weed Management Trials: Many pre -emergence herbicides are available for controlling annual grassy and br oadleaf weeds in Christmas trees. However, some weeds escape pre- emergence control, particularly the weed species that are either naturally tolerant to a pre -emergence herbicide or emerge late in the summer when the herbicide has undergone significant degr adation. Dr. Aulakh Dismiss Turf, Glyphosate), their different formulations, and combinations for weed control efficacy and Christmas tree tolerance. Christmas tree species under evaluation are: balsam fir, C anaan fir, D ouglas -fir, Fraser fir, Nordman fir, Turkish fir, Colorado blue spruce, Norway spruce, eastern white pine, and eastern hemlock. Christmas tree weed management research trials 2018 at Windsor (A) and Griswold (B), CT. The 2017 weed management trials have discovered several safe and effective herbicides for pre- emergence weed control in Fraser fir, balsam fir, Colorado blue spruce, Canaan fir, and Doug las-fir. Full labelled rates of SC (15.5 floz/a), Sureguard (12 oz/a), atrazine + s- metolachlor (2 pt/a) + mesotrione (5 floz/a) resulted in excellent weed control . Although the westar herbicide resulted in excellent weed control and the longest duration of weed control in 2017 it also resulted in significant reduction in leader length compared to other herbicides . Leader length in westar treated plant s was not different from the non- treated plants due to weed completion in the non-treated plots . Results from these trials are being shared with the Christmas tree growers at the twilight meetings of CCTGA . The 2018 post -emergence research trials have found good to excellent levels of Christmas tree (balsam fi r, Douglas -fir, fraser fir, Colorado blue spruce, Norway spruce, and white pine) tolerance to imazapic and callisto herbicides. Impact: These two herbicides may become valuable post -emergence options for growers to control or suppress several of the difficult -to-control weeds such as field bindweed, yellow nutsedge, mugwort, wild carrot, and smooth bedstraw without any serious risk of Christmas tree injury. Organic Production Systems Weed management is one of the greatest challenges in organic produ ction systems because chemical herbicides are not allowed in order to meet the organic production standards . A multi- year field study is underway at the Valley Laboratory to investigate the role of cover crops, crop rotations, and weed management systems ( organic vs chemical) for managing weeds in sweet corn and winter squash . Cover crops being investigated include cereal rye, spring oats, Sudan sorghum, and crimson clover . Rotational components include winter squash and sweet corn crops . The organic weed control methods include A B The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 182 hoeing, application of vinegar or Weed Zap, an organic herbicide (clove oil 45% and cinnamon Oil 45%) . First year results indicated significant reduction in weed density (common purslane, field pansy, redroot pigweed, crabgrass, and horseweed) with a combination of cereal rye and crimson clover . Following cereal rye, overall weed control in chemically managed sweet corn/summer squash ranged between 95 to 99%. In organically managed sweet corn and winter squash, following a cereal rye plus crimson clover mixture weed control was in the range of 85 to 95 % . These results indicate that cereal rye plus crimson clover mix can be a viable weed management option for organic sweet corn and winter squash. Sweet corn -winter squash rotation fo llowing cover crops at Valley Lab, Windsor, CT. Strawberry and Rosemary Trials There are few safe pre- emergence and early -post-emergence herbicides for weed control in newly transplanted strawberries . Two field research trials are being conducted since 2 017 at the Valley Laboratory, Windsor CT to assess safety and weed control efficacy in strawberry and rosemary to A16003 (bicyclopyrone), an experimental herbicide being developed by Syngenta . These research efforts seek to provide safer and more effective chemical weed management options for strawberry and rosemary growers in CT. Strawberry (A) and Rosemary (B) bicyclopyrone herbicide tolerance trials 2018 at Windsor, CT . Research trials in 2017 revealed excellent rosemary tolerance to over -the-top application of A16003 (bicyclopyrone) up to 6.84 fl . oz/a made either within 48 hours after transplanting or 14 days after transplanting. However, strawberry was very sensitive when application (directed) was made within 48 hours of transplanting with a stand loss of 55 to 70% at 3.42 and 6.84 fl . oz/a, was treated at 3.42 fl . oz/a, 14 days after transplanting, only temporary chlorotic injury (25- A B 183 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 30%) was observed . Therefore, it appears application of bicyclopyrone at 3.42 fl . oz/a may have a use as an early -post-emergence herbicide for controlling many broadleaf and grassy weeds in newly planted as well as established strawberries. Plant Disease Research Boxwood Blight Boxwood blight i s a new, introduced disease in Connecticut . The fungus that causes boxwood blight, Calonectria pseudonaviculata (C.ps), forms leaf spot and stem lesions resulting in defoliation and dieback of boxwood. The impact of the disease has been very high; boxwood plant losses have been estimated at over $5.5 million in Connecticut since October 2011. In addition, the concern about boxwood has resulted in reduced or lost orders for other plants, resulting in a multiplier effect on economic losses. Development of th e boxwood evaluation program The breeding of disease -tolerant boxwood cultivars is important for reducing the incidence of boxwood blight in Connecticut while providing landscapers with cultivars that have desired traits . In order to better assess boxwood tolerance to blight among cultivars, Dr. LaMondia is collaborating with researchers across the United States to create a standard protocol for boxwood evaluations that can be conducted across institutions. This will include rating cultivars against previou sly tested plants to assign a scaling of 1 (most susceptible) to 5 (least susceptible) . A number of early stage breeding lines have been evaluated and significant variation has been demonstrated consistent with parental traits . This is the first year of th e evaluation program in which the standard protocol will be developed and tested at the Valley Laboratory before being assessed at other institutions. Movement of C. pseudonaviculata through a landscape Boxwoods are an important component of established l andscapes, especially historical plantings in which they are highly valued . A better understanding of how boxwood blight moves through a landscape from an infected plant to other cultivars and how fungicides can be used to manage disease spread are importa nt for preserving boxwoods in landscapes . Dr. La Mondia is conducting a field trial to determine how an infected boxwood plant will spread infection to surrounding boxwoods under conditions of no fungicide treatments, the use of a protectant spray (a fungicide that stays on the surface of the plant), and the combination of protectant sprays with systemic sprays (fungicides that move into the plant) . The fungicide treatments will be evaluated using a calendar -based spray approach (every month regardless of disease detection or weather) versus an incidence- based spray approach (fungicides will only be applied after disease is detected) . Additionally, temperature and humidity will be monitored in the plot to determine how these two environmental conditions affec t disease development . Data will be collected for three years. The results will help in creating disease management recommendations for boxwoods in established landscapes. Rotation crops for management of lesion nematodes The lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans , is a very common pest that can directly affect perennial strawberry plantings and is associated with fungal root rots in the strawberry black root rot complex . Management of the disease complex is currently achieved through reducing the number of lesion nematodes by crop rotation, but these rotations require multiple years out of strawberry . We evaluated 4 rotation regimes in replicated field microplots to determine whether 3 potentially nematode -antagonistic crops grown in sequence within one y ear could effectively manage lesion nematodes within a shorter 1 - year time frame. Rotation crops were planted in spring (early April), summer (beginning of July), and fall (mid -September) of 2016 and 2017. Rotation crop sequence treatments consisted of: 1) oats till soybeans ( Glycine max) , and a fall The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 184 planting of no- till rye (Secale cereal ) plus hairy till buckw heat (Fagopyrum esculentum ), and a fall planting of no- till wheat (Triticum aestivum ); 3) Pacific Gold ( Avena followed by no -till millet plus Rudbeckia hirta , and a ) tilled in spring 2017 and populations were monitored using a soybean bioassay . Roots and soil in plots were sampled and the number of lesions per g soybean root were counted after 3 weeks . In microplots, lesion nematode populations were lower after a full year for rotation sequences 3 and 4 than for rotation treatments 1 and 2, indicating that growing multiple nematode -antagonistic crops within a single year may be a viable nematode control tactic . Lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans Tobacco Disease Research The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Valley Laboratory was established in 1921 as the Tobacco Substation, to combat tobacco problems and diseases such as wildfire, a devastating disease caused by a bacterial plant pathogen . Wildfire was eventually eliminated by the development of plant resistance to this pathogen. Ever since, tobacco breeding to incorporate genetic plant resistance to plant pathogens has been used to successfully manage diseases. Plant resistance is the most economical, environmentally responsible, and often most effective way to control diseases. The development of plant resistance to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) in the 1950's, to ozone damage (weather fleck) in the 1960's, black shank in the 1970's, and Fusarium wilt in the 1980's and early 1990's effectively controlled serious diseases which each threatened to seriously impact or even wipe out cigar wrapper tobacco production in the Connecticut River Valley . There are currently a number of pathogens that threaten the crop. Dr. LaMondia conducts an ongoing breeding program to develop tobacco mosaic virus, and Peronospora 185 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 tabacina (blue mold) for both shade and broadleaf types . Recently, a male -sterile F1 hybrid 'B2' highly resistant to Fusarium wilt, TMV and the TCN and with moderate resistance to blue mold and black root rot was released and licensed . Black shank, caused by Phytophthora nicotianae , has re -emerged as a serious pathogen in Connecticut and we working to develop a hybri d line with significant resistance to the pathogen. Our first candidate line, B3, was evaluated under field conditions in 2014 and 2015 and, while resistant, was found to be lacking in sufficient wrapper leaf quality . Additional crosses are now being made . Black root rot, caused by the fungus Thielaviopsis basicola has been damaging and increasing in impact in recent years with cool wet springs. We obtained three sources of dark wrapper tobacco with high levels of black root rot resistance from cooperating scientists in Kentucky . A back -cross program is being used to transfer resistance to CT broadleaf, and resistant plants are being selected for broadleaf characteristics. Inbreds have been developed and have been used to develop hybrid lines with resistance to multiple pathogens . A number of these lines are being evaluated under commercial conditions and three have been licensed with a company for commercial seed production . Breeding for resistance to Potato Virus Y (PVY) has been a high priority, however, t he burley tobacco cultivar (TN -86) that is the commercial source of resistance to Potato Virus Y (PVY) has been evaluated and found not to be resistant to the new PVY strains that occur in potato, tobacco, and other solanaceous crops . No source of resistan ce to the new strains is currently known, so this objective has been put on hold. Impacts: C9 tobacco carries resistance to Fusarium wilt and TMV . It has been widely grown since its release (>80% of acreage) and has prevented more than $5 million in losse s each year since 1992. The development of a male -sterile hybrid broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco with resistance to most of the major pathogens, including Fusarium wilt, TMV, the TCN and blue mold, will allow sustainable production with reduced disease and much reduced pesticide inputs . Growing B2 eliminates the need for nematode management at over $500 per acre per year . New varieties in development are resistant to black root rot, for which there are no current management options. B1, B2 and D1 have been released as a new cultivars and licensed to a local company. Proceeds will support further research on plant resistance . Adding resistance to black root rot will further reduce plant losses to disease. Tobacco Cyst Nematode Management Trap crops are being developed for nonchemical control of cyst cyst nematodes Globodera pallida. Because of the difficulties in working with this regulated pathogen in the United States, Dr. LaMondia is cooperating with scientists from Idaho to conduct experiments with the closely related tobacco cyst nematode G. tabacum as a model system . The influence of broadleaf cigar wrapper the tobacco cyst nematode, Globodera tabacum , was investigated in two years. Sixty -five microplots 1- m-diam, naturally infested with various densities of TCN, were transplanted with nematode -susceptible shade tobacco (cv. Litchi tomato. In 2016, treatments were expanded t o include eastern black nightshade and a cultivated fallow . TCN densities were determined before planting and again after harvest by sampling each microplot with 10 cores 1.5- cm-d to 15- cm depth. Soil was dried and extracted using a modified Fenwick can. Cysts were crushed and the number of viable encysted J2 per cm3 soil determined . Nematode reproduction as determined by the ratio of the final (Pf) to initial (Pi) populations varied between treatments . In 2015, Pf/Pi ratios were 2.89, 0.38 and 0.14 for susceptible tobacco, resistant tobacco and Litchi tomato, respectively . All three plants were significantly different from each other . In 2016, Pf/Pi ratios were highest for eastern black nightshade (6.64) and susceptible tobacco (2.84), which were differe nt from fallow (0.56), resistant B2 tobacco (0.32) and Litchi tomato (0.20) . These results are consistent with previous Litchi tomato, S. sisymbriifolium , stimulates tobacco cyst The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 186 Yellow Lupulin glands of female hop cones contain resins, acids, and essential oils, which are responsible for aroma, flavor, and bitterness in beer. than resistant or susceptible tobacco but unlike eastern black nightshade, does not allow significant nematode reproduction in roots, indicating that it may be an effective trap crop for management of G. tabacum . In addition, G. tabacum may be useful as a substitute model for the quarantined path ogen Globodera pallida for trap cropping with tobacco cyst better than tobacco but unlike eastern black nightshade, does not allow sig nificant reproduction in roots, indicating that it may be an effective trap crop for management of G. tabacum . In addition, G. tabacum is useful as a substitute model for the quarantined pathogen Globodera pallida for trap cropping with S. sisymbriifolium under field conditions. Reduced Pesticide Residues in Tobacco Connecticut shade and broadleaf tobacco types are used to produce some of the highest quality cigar wrappers in the world. Blue mold, caused by Peronospora tabacina , is a leaf spot disease tha t can completely destroy the crop, valued at up to $50,000,000 per year . Fungicides can help protect the leaves, but growers and cigar makers want to keep residues low . Dr. LaMondia conducted experiments to maximize disease control with reduced levels of f ungicide in cured leaves in 2016 and 2017. The strategy tested investigated the effects of using azoxystrobin, dimethomorph, mandipropamid, fluopicolide or oxathiapiprolin fungicides early in the season and avoiding or minimizing sprays prior to harvest as opposed to the standard application of the same total amount of fungicide spread out over the season. Leaves were harvested, cured and fungicide residues determined by Dr. Brian Eitzer of the Department of Analytical Chemistry . Our results indicated that fungicide concentrations were stable in the plant and may have more systemic activity than thought . Reduced spray programs were as effective in managing blue mold and target spot as standard sprays with reduced fungicide residues in cured leaves. Impact : An effective spray program that results in reduced fungicide residues in broadleaf and shade cigar wrapper tobacco types will increase marketability and reduce human exposure to pesticides. Hops Research Hop ( Humulus lupulus ) cultivation in the Northeastern United States dates back to the first settlers, but disappeared for a century because of disease pressure and the enactment of Prohibition. Subsequently, it was established in the Pacific Northwest, which is currently the largest production ar ea worldwide (53,282 acres; IHGC - 2017 Statistical Report). New York State has the largest production area in the Northeast (400 acres, IHGC -2017 Statistical Report) followed by Vermont and Massachusetts (25 acres each; IHGC - 2017 Statistical Report) and Maine (24 acres) . Commercial hop production has just started in CT and New Jersey (15 acres each) . The increasing popularity of the microbrew culture, local brewpubs, home brewing, and the growing demand for regional products have created a niche market for high quality hops in the Northeast. The initial objective of this project, which is supervised by Dr. James LaMondia, Dr. Katja Maurer, and Dr. Elisha Allan -Perkins was to investigate the feasibility of hop production in CT . Current objectives are to expand the number of hop varieties evaluated and to demonstrate effective integrated pest management (IPM) techniques . Growing characteristics and susceptibility to diseases and pests were examined for five varieties using high and low trellis systems in two locations - Valley Laboratory in Windsor and Lockwood Farm in Hamden, CT - over the last 5 years. The most common diseases and pests are downy 187 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 mildew, which is the most damaging disease in the northeastern U.S., two- spotted spider mites, and potato leafhoppers, which is a unique pest to hops in the Northeast . Diseases and pests can be controlled by inten sive scouting rigorous sanitation measures, pesticides, biological controls (e.g. predators), removing weeds, and stripping the lower leaves off of the bines . A region -specific integrated pest management program was established, which includes intensive scouting and timely control measures, and is available as the Guidelines for Integrated Pest Management for Hops in C onnecticut on the CAES website. (A) In the spring, the crew prepares the hop yard, trains bines on twine and prunes . (B) Hop bines can climb more than 20 feet . During the season the hops are fertilized, irrigated, scouted for diseases and pests and treated . (C) Female mature cones are harvested mid of August to beginning of September. (D) The crew cuts bines to bring them to the shed and hand picks the cones or (E) using a mechanical harvester. The cones are weighed to determine yield, dried and shipped to a laboratory for quality analysis. The varieties Cascade and Summit are well suited for CT, with Cascade being more reliable on the high trellis set up, whereas the semi -dwarf variety Summit does well on either high or low trellis . Perle, a German breeding line, had the smallest growth and lowest yield . AlphAroma, moderately resistant in other areas, was the most susceptible to downy mildew . Cascade tended to have less downy mildew and potato leaf hopper damage than the other varieties . Hop plants at Lockwood farm produced more cones than plants at the Valley Laboratory . Especially on high trellis systems, the varieties tested met the industry standards for yield, and for alpha and beta acid content, except for Newport which was consistently low and Cascade which was consistently high for alpha and beta acids. In conclusion, the trial has proven the general feasibility of successful hop production in CT, but not all varieties do well . More varieties are currently being tested . An additional 44 varieties were planted at Lockwood Farm since 2016 and an additional 17 more varieties were planted in Windsor . Preliminary results suggest the varieties Zeus (CTZ), Cluster High, and Super Alpha are highly susceptible to downy mildew in Connecticut . Brewer's Gold, Chinook, Comet, and Southern Brewer seem to be promising candidates, but more research needs to be done. A recent project supported by the CT Specialty Crop Block Grant Program has been initiated to collect and assess wild or feral hops representing unique germplasm that has survived without human intervention from multiple locations and environments around the state . In tha t regard, ten wild hops were collected across Connecticut and were planted at the Windsor Farm . These plants will be assessed for their yield, flavor, quality, and disease susceptibility as possible sources for new breeding lines and/or to be cultivated as Connecticut specific hops with flavor profiles. Impacts: Assessment of different cultivars in terms of their growth, yield, and disease/pest development will lead to a better understanding of successful hop cultivation in Connecticut. The general feasibi lity of successful high quality hop production in CT has been proven. A D E The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 188 Hops varieties differ in yields, growth characteristics, quality, and susceptibility to downy mildew. Not every variety does well in CT. Downy mildew, spider mites, and potato leafhopper s, which are the most dreaded disease and pests, can be controlled with a rigorous pest management. Drs. Maurer and LaMondia created an Integrated Pest Management Guideline for CT. The testing of wild hops may bring new varieties or breeding lines to CT. Christmas trees In 2015, Dr. Cowles established a planting of firs in Brooklyn, CT, at a site with a high naturally occurring incidence of phytophthora root rot . This experiment is investigating soil acidification through the addition of elemental sulfur to the soil as a method to prevent infection by root rot organisms. The underlying hypothesis is that Phytophthora spp. are less tolerant of acid soils than are the fir tree hosts . Two species were planted, Fraser fir, which is highly susceptible to Phytophthora , and Canaan fir, which is somewhat tolerant. Evaluation of tree health in the same year as planting demonstrated a highly significant treatment effects from application of sulfur, which benefitted both species of fir, and a phosphite root dip, which benefitted only the Fraser firs. In the 2016 evaluation of this experiment (the year following planting), the trees in the low pH (acidified soil) plots had twice the terminal growth as the trees in plots not amended with sulfur . Through 2017, the order from lowest to highest in mortality rate has been Canaan with low pH, Canaan with high pH, Fraser with low pH, and Fraser with high pH . The hypothesis that phytophthora would not grow well in acid conditions was confirmed in laboratory dose - response experiments for four Phytophthora spp. previously isolated from CT Christmas trees by Dr. Katie McKeever. Overall, acidification of soil in this field is projected to result in acceptable yield of harvestable Canaan firs with minimal losses due to root rots , whereas the losses resulting from other treatment combinations would probably be considered unacceptable. Diseased trees from this Brooklyn, CT, field site were used by Drs. LaMondia and Cowles to isolate the associated Phytophthora pathogen. Gene sequencing conducted by Dr. Schultes and morphological examination by Dr. DeWei Li have determined that this species was previously undescribed . Experiments are underway to fulfill Koch's postulates and to publish a description of this new species of plant dise ase organism. The observation that tree growth one year after planting was associated with better tree color in the year of planting, and that all trees were somewhat yellow in the year of planting, suggests that improvement of plant nutritional status du ring the year of planting could have tremendous dividends for initial establishment and future growth of the trees . In spring of 2017, a follow -up experiment was started, in which the influence of sulfur incorporation at the time of planting, and root dips or drenches of products that could enhance root growth were tested in a factorial experiment to determine which tools may benefit tree growth . Bare -root transplants significantly benefitted from the addition of controlled- release fertilizer, as evident fr om their improved color . Addition of sulfur at this research site, which does not have a history of problems with phytophthora root rot, did not improve the health of these trees. Impact: Root dips to improve initial establishment and protect Christmas tree bare -root transplants from infection with Phytophthora are now being practiced, with the result of reducing by one year the time to grow a salable tree. VALLEY LABORATORY SERVICE ACTIVITIES 189 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Requests for Information A total of 6,539 inquiries were answered at the Valley Laboratory during the past year . The majority of these queries were answered by Ms. Rose Hiskes (72%) in the inquiry office (6 5% of these from the public sector ) or by Dr. LaMondia ( 15% of total of whic h were commercial) . About 65% of the information requests to the inquiry office were from the public sector; the remainder was from commercial growers, government, and nonprofit, educational or other ( 35%). The majority of inquiries answered by Ms. Hiskes concerned insects ( 26%), diseases (1 5%), pesticides (1 2%) or horticulture (11%) . Most concerned landscape and nursery 41%), and structural entomology ( and animal (1%) inquiries . These inquiries primarily concerned tobacco (4 2%), hops (2 2%), nursery and landscape (15%), vegetables ( 7%), fruit (5%), golf turf (8%) and Christmas trees ( 1%). All scientists and many of the staff at the Valley Laboratory assist growers and homeowners. Valley Laboratory scientists made 97 presentations to grower, professional and citizen groups (over 5,000 people), were interviewed 17 times and made 2 13 visits to commercial nurseries, greenhouse s, farms, forests and landscapes to diagnose complex problems or conduct research projects . Dr. LaMondia maintained the Connecticut River Valley Blue Mold Web Site to keep growers current with the disease in North America, and inform about management optio ns. His laboratory conducted 125 nematode diagnostic samples and conducted testing as an APHIS certified pinewood nematode export testing facility. Thomas Rathier , emeritus soil scientist, continued to visit specific urban sites where community gardens either already existed or were planned by community organizers . At each site, Mr. Rathier made an assessment of the horticultural capabilities of the site as well as the likeliness of heavy metal contamination being found in soils on the site . Samples were t aken at each site and analyzed by Mr. Rathier and Mr. Musante (Analytical Chemistry Department) . Mr. Rathier subsequently relayed results to appropriate stakeholders along with suggestions for remediation and/or avoidance of soils whose metal concentration s exceed the Connecticut standards. Soil testing A total of 4,454 soil tests were expertly performed by Ms. Diane Riddle during the past year . About 6 8% were performed for commercial growers and 3 2% for homeowners . Of the commercial samples submitted, 69% were for landscapers; 8% for tobacco growers; 5% for vegetable growers, 5% for municipalities, 3% for golf course superintendents; 1 % for nursery growers; 1% for small fruit, 1% for Christmas tree growers, and 4% for research. Impact: Approximately 25% of soil samples tested did not require additional fertilizer . Reducing the over-application of fertilizers protects the environment. Valley Lab Information Office Insect, Disease and Plant Health Survey Ms. Rose Hiskes diagnosed a wide range of insect, disease, weed and plant health problems on herbaceous and woody ornamentals, lawns, vegetables, fruit and Christmas trees for homeowners, farmers, commercial businesses, other government agencies and nonprofits. The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 Figure 1. Leafhopper nymph. \u00a9 CAES, Rose Hiskes Insects During the spring and summer months, insect pests, such as gypsy moth caterpillars, leafhoppers, and the fourlined plant bug affected trees, shrubs and flowers in landscapes. In 2018, most gypsy moth caterpillars did not die from the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga or nucleopolyhedrosis virus. Rains in April, May and June were two inches less than in 2017 and likely insufficient to build up the fungus population and keep infection cycles going in the caterpillars. As of late June call s were coming in from eastern and central parts of the state about the numerous brown moths flying in yards. Leafhoppers were a problem in nurseries, landscapes, vegetables and small fruits during late season 2017 and early summer 2018 (Figure 1) . Hopper burn, a browning and curling of leaves caused by the toxic saliva injected when the insect feeds, causes people to think the host has a foliar disease. Redbud and witch hazel were hosts in nurseries and landscapes. Fruits such as grape and raspberries had leafhopper damage . Multiple people came in with leafhopper damage on their eggplants . For field crops, hops were host to leafhoppers as well. Fourlined plant bug was a problem in early summer this year. Hosts were herbs such as rosemary, lemon balm, sage, basil and mint . Also ornamentals such as coleus and hydrangea were affected. (Figure 2) . With this insect as well people think their plant has a leafspot disease as there are uniform round brown s pots all over the young leaves. At times the brown tissue drops out, causing people to think they have a shot hole leaf disease . The insects are skittish and disappear to leaf undersides as people approach and so are rarely seen.

Fourlined plant bug adult. \u00a9CAES, Rose Hiskes 191 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 Structural and human inse ct pests continue to create problems for Connecticut citizens . Pest control operators as well as homeowners have brought in the spotted Mediterranean cockroach, a European species found in homes and landscapes. It is a nuisance pest, not feeding on our foods or landscape plants. A human pest, the black widow spider was reported found in Rhode Island. The digital image submitted was credible . Another pest, the human bed bug, is still very problematic, coming in from congregate housing and also an Air BnB site this year . Bat bugs are also being found and need to be distinguished from the human bed bug as treatment is very different . (Figure 3). Connecticut has a new pollinator protection law that took effect in 2017. Homeowners are no longer able to buy some neonicotinoid insecticides that may harm pollinators. One neonicotinoid, acetamiprid, is still available to homeowners . A homeowner product with acetamiprid, labelled for use on flowers, v egetables and fruits as a foliar spray is available. Homeowners can protect pollinators from insecticide poisoning by applying insecticides only to plants that are not frequented by bees . Diseases Vegetables such as tomato and squash have many possible disease problems . Late blight arrived in Connecticut last September attacking tomato and potato. (Figure 4) . Plants die quickly with leaves, stems and fruit being affected . Bacteria l diseases were prevalent in late season 2017 and have been seen already in the summer of 2018. Bacterial leaf spot of peppers continues to be a problem in the homeowner market and since it is seed borne, it is therefore a problem in the greenhouse industr y where transplants are produced. Woody plants such as stone and pome fruits suffered severe disease damage in the 2018 season . Both fruit and ornamental cultivars of plum and cherry suffered twig dieback from brown rot in June . Plants blossomed beautiful ly and began developing fruit before conditions became favorable and the disease struck . Fireblight has been confirmed by Dr. Quan Zeng in a large old fruiting pear . Crabapple samples have come in with the burned foliage and shepherd's crook tips as well. Weeds and Herbicides Homeowners fight weeds in their vegetable gardens. Nettleleaf goosefoot, a summer annual, was a new plant to this office in 2017 . Since then it has come in from other gardens throughout the state. Figure 3 . Bed bug, left. Bat bug, right. \u00a9 CAES, Rose Hiskes Figure 4. \u00a9 Rose Hiskes The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 192 Lawn weeds can be difficult to man age. One shrub that many people love, Rose of Sharon, can become a weed problem in lawns . As the seeds mature in the fall the pods open and can drop seed onto the lawn. Once they germinate their broadleaves are very noticeable in a lawn . Mowing does keep them short but it does not kill them and pulling them by hand seems to be the only viable option. Just as is the case with Ajuga (bugleweed), there are no herbicides labelled for Rose of Sharon control in lawns. Plant Health - Weather Connecticut's weath er continues to live up to the statement \"If you don't like the weather, wait a minute.\" Frost for most of the northern part of the state came the last day of October for the 2017 growing season. A hard freeze followed on November 9. There was a cold snap the week between Christmas and New Year's and the first week of January. Some boxwoods suffered significant winter injury and even death with many people suspecting boxwood blight . With boxwood blight, affected leaves drop from the plant but when winter i njured the straw colored leaves remain on the plant. The remainder of the winter was mild with some rain and some snow . Bradley Airport reached 77o F on February 21. March temperatures were more normal with two and a half inches of snow falling . The last freeze of the winter at Bradley Airport was April 23 . In the light, sandy soils of the river valley cole crops such as peas and broccoli were able to be planted late March. Impact: Accurate identification of pests of agricultural and human health significance has resulted in economic savings to commercial growers and homeowners, reduced human and environmental exposure to pesticides, and increased human safety. The Gordon S. Taylor Conference Room Many agricultural organizations used the conference room at the Valley Laboratory regularly for their meetings. During the past year , 18 different groups used the room on 47 occasions . Our most frequent users were the CT Rhododendron Society, C T Invasive Plants Working Group, CT Farmland Trust, Pesticide License Training, C T Invasive Plant Council, Land Trust Alliance, CT Native Plant Pollinator & Wildlife Working Group, CT Department of Agriculture Food Safety, CT Christmas Tree Growers Association, CT Hop Growers Association, Nursery Landscape Research Group, CT Agriculture Information Council, CT Invasive Plant Council, CT Vineyard & Winery, West Hartford Farmers Market, UCONN Greenhouse Specialist, Farm Credit East, and Bishop's Orchard Board of Directors . Ms. Jane Canepa -Morrison scheduled the meetings and J ames Preste and Isaac Buabeng arranged the furniture and ensured that the room was available after hours. 193 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2017 -2018 SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL ARTICLES PUBLISHED BY STAFF DURING 201 7-2018 Adisa, I.
