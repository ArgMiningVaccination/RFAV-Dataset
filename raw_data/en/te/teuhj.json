Spring already? Well, not quite. But the clocks [sprung forward](https://www.firstforwomen.com/posts/entertainment/why-daylight-savings-time-exists-127514), and that means we're well on our way. While we may have lost one precious hour of sleep on the clock this morning, [recovering your energy](https://www.firstforwomen.com/gallery/health/snacks-for-energy) and motivation with a meditation practice is great way to welcome the new season. This week, it might be a little harder than usual to get out of bed. If energy and motivation are dwindling, we get it. With that in mind, we wanted to offer you a simple way to start claiming the vibrant energy of spring for extra motivation and energy. If you've never meditated before, don't worry, a [guided meditation](https://www.firstforwomen.com/gallery/beauty/pictures-for-meditation-158046) is an easy way to start. They can help wake up your brain and [ regulate your stress levels](https://www.firstforwomen.com/posts/sleep/pink-noise-better-sleep) without too much work, so you can stay focused, calm, and collected throughout your day instead of getting frazzled and you guessed it \u2014 more tired. [One specific study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170906103416.htm) found that mindfulness meditation increased energy levels and executive functioning in the brain of subjects in as little as 25 minutes per day! The best thing about these practices, though, is that they don't involve sitting cross-legged for uncomfortable amounts of time (though, if that's what you're into, feel free!). Plus, you can listen to one just about anywhere. With all that said, here are five of my favorite guided meditations that you can use to find extra energy and motivation starting today. Listen to one (or as many) of the videos below in the morning or even at night before bed, and be sure to practice daily! This morning meditation by spiritual leader and author [ Louise Hay](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYTGWaEBUiCYhCESRwu8loA) will lift your spirits as you wake up. Hay's soft voice leads you through an experience of giving thanks for all that you have and all that you are in a way that will set you up for a day of peace and continuous gratitude. This guided meditation from [Linda Hall Meditation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTDiRJp9MeAgZbmwmq4w4GA) will help you think positively and focus on abundance. Through a visualization practice, Linda helps you picture what it is you want in life so that you can focus on it and attract it to you. She will also guide your thoughts toward self-confidence with affirmations that help you believe you deserve to have everything that you want. This guided meditation from [Jason Stephenson](https://www.youtube.com/user/ILoveJuicyShow) is a personal favorite. Not only is Jason's voice soothing and lovely, but his relaxing tone puts you into a meditative state allowing his affirmations about energy use and productivity to sink in. This meditation will teach you how to use your energy so you're getting everything done, but not burning out. You'll feel motivated and at peace by the end. This meditation by YouTube user [Michael Sealy](https://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelSealey) is another go-to. Sealey refers to it as a self-hypnosis, and you will most certainly feel as though you've been put in a trance listening to it. Sealy first guides you through a breathing practice to help you relax and reach a meditative state, then recites affirmations that will boost your confidence and sharpen your focus. If you've got a day ahead of you or a project to work on, but you're just lacking energy and focus, this guided meditation from [The Honest Guys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4jWo5kiyOCt4PnvF4jbaLg) is for you. This meditation is perfect to do just before you buckle down to complete any task. The narrator will first guide you through a breathing practice into a fully relaxed state, then you'll hear soothing nature sounds like birds chirping for the remainder of the video. You'd be surprised how much a quick nature break can help your brain focus!
