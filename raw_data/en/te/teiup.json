Different meditation tools such as guided breath work and imagery, mantra, concentration, free writing, walking and conscious eating will be explored whether you are new to meditation or wish to deepen your personal practice. There are many ways to meditate and we encourage sampling and experimenting with different classes to find the meditation style that inspires and works best for you. Mindfulness Mindfulness is a powerful way of promoting health, reducing stress and living more fully in the present moment. The practice of mindfulness can bring awareness to an individual's relationship to stress. By understanding that relationship, one can choose to develop alternative ways of being with, reacting to and addressing stress. At the Center for Wellness and Integrative Medicine, every offering is based in mindful experience. We also offer a more directed approach to mindfulness, through hands-on study, workshops and intensive trainings in mindfulness. "}
