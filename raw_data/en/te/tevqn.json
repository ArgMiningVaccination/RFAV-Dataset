Over the next few years, the Hamilton site expansion is expected to add a combination of temporary construction and contracting jobs, as well as new permanent positions, including scientists, engineers and manufacturing and quality professionals. \"Thanks to the bi-partisan support of Governor Steve Bullock and the congressional delegation - Sens. Jon Tester and Steve Daines and Rep. Greg Gianforte - Montana is emerging as a hub for the biotechnology industry,\" said Bailey. \"GSK is grateful for their leadership and the opportunity they have given us to create new jobs and expand our footprint in the state.\" Hamilton is one of nine GSK manufacturing sites in the United States, and 86 sites globally, that produce a variety of prescription medicines, vaccines and consumer healthcare products.
