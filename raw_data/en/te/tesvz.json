Read on to find out its health benefits.", "sitename": "All Things Health", "date": "2022-11-09", "cleaned_text": "Kelp (Laminaria) What is Kelp (Laminaria)? Kelp (kun bu, ), also known as [Laminaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminaria), is one of the fastest growing seaweeds on earth that can grow as much as 300 feet in a single year. Kelp forests grow primarily on the Pacific Coast, and they provide food and shelter for thousands of fish and marine mammal species, which means that the plant plays a very important role in the underwater ecosystem. The earliest evidence of human usage of Sea Kelp is found in the stone age sites in Africa. It is suggested that the growth of Kelp around the Pacific Rim may have facilitated the early migration of humans across Northeast Asia into the Americas. This is also known as the Kelp Highway Hypothesis. Also, as Kelp is very efficient at creating methane and sugars that can be converted to ethanol, it is a possible eco-friendly energy source. In [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/traditional-chinese-medicine/), Kelp falls under the category of 'Cool herbs that transform Phlegm and stop [Cough](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/respiratory-health/spring-allergies/)'. Cold in nature, Kelp can help individuals who have too much Heat in their body, such as those experiencing a Yang Excess or a Yin Deficiency, to restore a healthy yin-yang balance. Salty in taste, Kelp has a draining effect on the body by clearing accumulations, removing phlegm and softening hard lumps. In particular, the herb targets the [Kidneys](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/energy-and-immunity/kidney-function/), the Liver and the stomach. Functions and Benefits of Kelp (Laminaria) Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) shows that Kelp has the following benefits: Kelp can reduce phlegm and soften hardness. In TCM, phlegm is a condition caused by the Stagnation of fluids that tend to start in the [Spleen](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/energy-and-immunity/spleen-function/) and go towards the Lungs. When such Stagnation accumulates, it thickens and becomes phlegm, which often transforms from Cool to Hot as the condition worsens. Kelp can help to treat the later stages of such Stagnation: Hot and Dry Phlegm with symptoms such as cough, goiter or scrofula. Also, this herb can help to address nodules in the neck and fullness in the chest due to phlegm, as well as palpable abdominal masses, Liver and Spleen enlargement, and a swollen painful scrotum. Also, Sea Kelp can promote urination to reduce swelling. For example, this herb can address edema and dysuria. Other than the above Kelp benefits, modern studies also suggest that Kelp can promote thyroid functions. As Kelp is high in natural iodine, which is essential to the proper functioning of the thyroid, it can help to encourage growth, energy and metabolism in the body. Hence, Kelp can also support our [immune system](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/natural-products/healing-foods/reishi-mushroom/) to fight infections.

It can help to slow down the metabolism of sugar, which reduces sugar spikes that are commonly found in diabetics after eating. This herb can reduce inflammation in joints and bones as well, which alleviates pain, especially for people suffering from arthritis. Extremely alkaline, Kelp helps to keep our body's pH balanced and prevent cancer growth. The high amount of lignans and phytochemicals found in Kelp also limit the amount of cancer cells that can be released into the bloodstream and limit tumour growth. The high iron, calcium and magnesium levels in Kelp also promotes better sleep through menopause.

Also, if Sea Kelp is overconsumed, it will result in an overdose of iodine, which can disrupt thyroid functions. Hence, Kelp is unsuitable for individuals with hyperthyroidism.
