The definition of a green therapy session can vary, ranging from a simple walk through a park to more adventurous activities like tree climbing, canoeing, or beach sitting. The primary objective is to help individuals reconnect with their bodies, which can enhance mental well-being, reduce stress and sadness, and provide inner peace by exposing them to natural elements such as greenery or water. Nature therapy is not a novel idea, as people have relied on natural environments for physical and mental healing for centuries. In recent times, with the emergence of environmentalism, there has been a renewed interest in the concept of nature therapy. Gardening has traditionally been a well-known form of nature therapy, and outdoor activities like hiking, birdwatching, swimming, and rock climbing are also gaining popularity.
