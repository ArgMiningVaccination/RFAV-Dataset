Listing a study does not mean it has been evaluated by the U.S. Federal Government. Read our | |ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02983487| | | Recruitment Status : Completed First Posted : December 6, 2016 Last Update Posted : April 1, 2022 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT02983487) [No Results Posted](/ct2/show/results/NCT02983487) [Disclaimer](/ct2/about-site/disclaimer) [How to Read a Study Record](/ct2/help/how-read-study) Due to waning of infectious as well as vaccine immunity and lack of vaccination boosters, a large number of adolescents and adults are no longer immunized against Bordetella pertussis, the agent of whooping cough and consequently may contract whooping cough. Furthermore, these populations represent a reservoir of the infectious agent from which the dissemination to non-immune infants is possible, causing severe illness, or even death, in this age group. Few studies have been carried out on whooping cough in developing countries (incidence, contaminator's age, etc.) and, specifically, none have assessed the duration of protection induced by the whole cell pertussis (wP) vaccine mainly presently used in these countries. However, data on the duration of vaccine induced protection are essential to determine i) the usefulness of vaccine boosters and ii) the target age group for these boosters. The aims of the present study are: - To evaluate the proportion of confirmed pertussis cases in infants presenting whooping cough syndrome (WP1a) - To evaluate the proportion of confirmed pertussis cases or healthy carriers among contact cases - To determine origin of the infant's contamination (WP1b) - To determine the duration of protection induced by the wP vaccines used in contact cases and the child population aged 3 to 15 yo (WP1b and WP2) - To bring new scientific evidences documenting the potential need for initiating boosters (WP1b and WP2) - To allow a comparison of the results with those obtained using the same methodology for the acellular pertussis vaccine and/or in other contexts. Potential implications for the use of pertussis vaccines in low and moderate income countries. - To increase local capabilities by the transfer of materials and expertise that will make the diagnosis of pertussis possible in the centres of reference and strengthen a pertussis monitoring network in the implicated countries. - To improve children's health through a better match of the vaccination schedule according to the reality of the situation. |Condition or disease||Intervention/treatment| |Bordetella Pertussis, Whooping Study Start Date :||January 22, 2017| |Actual Primary Date :||July (WP1a) | Infant under 6 months old with clinical signs of whooping cough syndrome. Nasopharyngeal sampling: A nasopharyngeal sample collected from each nostril by aspiration or swabbing | Procedure: Nasopharyngeal sampling | Nasopharyngeal sample by aspiration or swabbing | Control case (WP1b) | Contact cases of infant with a positive diagnosis for whooping cough. Nasopharyngeal sampling: A nasopharyngeal sample collected from each nostril by aspiration or swabbing Blood sampling: A blood sample collected by fingerprick | Procedure: Nasopharyngeal sampling | Nasopharyngeal sample by aspiration or swabbing Procedure: Blood Sampling Blood sample by the tip of a finger (fingerprick) | Seroepidemiological cohort (WP2) | Children between 3 and 15 years old with complete primo-vaccination against B.Pertussis Blood sampling: A blood sample collected by fingerprick | Procedure: Blood Sampling | Blood sample by the tip of a finger (fingerprick) - Proportion of biologically confirmed cases of pertussis in patients under 6 months old admitted into hospital with clinical signs corresponding to whooping cough syndrome. [ Time Frame: November 2018 ]Primary Outcome of WP1a (Cohort 1) - Proportion of cases tested positive for B.Pertussis given by the presence of B. pertussis DNA in the nasopharyngeal sample or by the presence of an anti-pertussis toxin IgG level >100 IU/mL in the serum. [ Time Frame: November 2018 ]Primary Outcome of WP1b (Cohort 2) - Proportion of cases tested positive given by the presence of an anti-pertussis toxin IgG level >100 IU/mL in the serum. [ Time Frame: November 2018 ]Primary Outcome of WP2 (Cohort 3) - Estimation of the relative risk of the disease occurring in the contact patients based on their immunization status and age groups [ Time Frame: April 2019 ] Biospecimen Retention: Samples Without DNA Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
