The idea that a patient's own cells can be reprogrammed to replace or eliminate faulty genes or to attack cancer cells in a way that is not naturally possible is giving hope to many. In 2017, we have seen several approvals from these innovative medicines, Kymriah, Y escarta and Luxturna to name a few. However, a key challenge for all players and drug-makers in this field remains to be addressed: the cost of manufacturing is critically high due to the nature of these highly personalized medicines. This high cost greatly limits the number of patients that can be eligible and threatens the sustainability of the therapy as a whole and this is likely to be reflected in the already high price tags of these drugs for the foreseeable future. In his presentation, Andreas Weiler would like to show the way these medicines are manufactured and delivered to the patients could have significant and disruptive implications for the future of healthcare. He will be sharing his vision and innovative technologies that could reduce the cost of these medicines significantly and make them accessible to a larger number of patients. Biography Andreas Weiler is the Global Business Unit Head of Emerging Technologies at Lonza where he oversees the Cell and Gene Therapy Contract Manufacturing businesses. Before joining Lonza he worked for Sigma Aldrich (SAFC), another leading CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) to the Pharma/biotech industries, for over 17 years where he held several positions as Business Director and finally as the Head of Strategic Marketing to the organization.

He holds a PhD in Organic Chemistry from the University of Freiburg and a MBA degree. andreas.weiler@lonza.com Andreas Weiler , Health Care Current Reviews 2018, Volume: 6 DOI: 10.4172/2375-4273-C9-062Page 32 Notes: Health Care : Current Reviews | ISSN: 2375-4273 | Volume: 6 October 26-27, 2018 | Boston, USAPredictive, Preventive & Personalized Medicine & Molecular Diagnostics9th International Conference on Integrative Medicine & Alternative treatments 3rd International Conference on&Optical coherence tomography imaging of human kidneys for prediction of post-transplant function Yu Chen University of Maryland, USA Statement of the Problem: The number of people on the waiting list for a kidney transplant grows each year and efforts to expand the donor pool to meet this demand have fallen short. Current discard rate for higher risk, expanded criteria donors (ECD) kidneys are nearly 45% compared to just over 10% for standard criteria donor (SCD) kidneys. Surgeons reference a multitude of factors which contribute to their decision to reject a kidney. Principal among these is biopsy results, which are performed routinely on ECD kidneys and are credited as the most frequent reason for discard. The true relevance of these factors is contested, with the majority appearing to have little correlation with graft function following transplant. There is a critical need to enhance prognostic measures and to explore new ways of gaining insights into the viability of these more at-risk kidneys. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides a non-invasive method for obtaining optical cross-sections of the superficial kidney cortex, i.e., \"virtual biopsy\" . OCT images reveal the microanatomy of the proximal convoluted tubules (PCTs). Quantification of the degree of swelling or prevalence of dilation may provide a valuable addition to current measures of kidney viability. Findings: OCT imaging was performed on donor's kidneys before and immediately after implantation during 169 human kidney transplant surgeries. In ECD kidneys, increased PCT lumen diameter and decreased epithelial thickness was found to predict delay graft function (DGF). Conclusion & Significance: OCT analysis of the donor's kidneys may aid in the allocation of kidneys to expand the donor pool, as well as help, predict post-transplant function in transplanted kidneys to inform post-operative care.

However, there is little research on genomics-based practice protocols or clinical decision support systems (CDSS's) that incorporate genomic information technologies at the point-of-care. We developed a CDSS whose user interface combines raw DNA sequence variant data and gut microbial biomarkers to enable a high level, holistic interpretation of the holobiome. Our goal was to individualize therapeutic and preventive interventions, based on insights gleaned from two 'omics' data sources and advanced laboratory biomarkers for oxidative stress and inflammation. While several studies have shown that polygenic risk analysis accurately predicts the individual risk of developing a chronic disease, our model attempts to extend risk stratification to identify molecularly defined subsets of individuals. Specifically, our CDSS clusters polymorphisms in multiple genetic loci that contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases: glucose and lipid dysregulation, endothelial dysfunction, mitochondrial stress, deficiencies in DNA repair capacity, circadian disruption, maladaptive emotion regulation and a dysbiotic gut microbiome. We believe that intelligent decision support tools are crucial to the integration of heterogeneous inputs from 'omics' technologies and evidence-based clinical regimens. Towards that end, we have designed an application that allows for easy, reliable and rapid assessment of genotype-phenotype relationships. The output is relevant and intelligible to both physicians and patients. In short, our vision of a genomic CDSS fully embraces the concept of the clinical holobiome. Finally, we present a descriptive case study of a 58-year old woman with a history of thrice recurrent bladder cancer. The presentation demonstrates how genetic loci, likely representing disease mechanistic pathways, can be paired with microbiota datasets and interpreted in the context of other known risk factors. This comprehensive approach provides new prospects for disease management and prevention.

In Brazil, cholesterol reaches about 18.4 million people and with the great growth, many seek alternative resources to improve this public health problem. Acupuncture, which originated in China for more than 5000 years, is based on the stimulation of points that provide various treatments. Phytotherapy, much older than acupuncture, is a worldwide practice of several ancient people, has its main proposal to obtain the benefits active principle of plants to treat various pathologies. This work aims at the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia, especially hypercholesterolemia, through stimuli with acupuncture points and the use of the herbal medicine turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), the root, popularly known as saffron, in the decrease and control of LDL. Methodology: Treatment was performed in 60 patients, of both sexes in the Integrated School Esphera. All patients underwent total cholesterol testing prior to treatment. The research was conducted from July 2017 to January 2018. Thirty patients were treated with 12 weekly sessions of acupuncture and 30 were instructed to take 1 spoon of turmeric dissolved in 150 ml of warm water in the morning and received 12 weekly sessions of acupuncture. Results: Patients who received only acupuncture treatment, 74% had post-treatment exams, LDL reduction, the other group who received acupuncture treatment associated with herbal medicine, 81% had LDL reduction after exams. Conclusion: It was found that acupuncture benefits in the decrease of LDL and associated to the herbal medicine with turmeric, patients have obtained the reduction of the LDL in the body thus guaranteeing the improvement in the quality of life.

There are quite a number of disease conditions which have caused many preventable deaths; if only the practitioners had taken a closer look at combining conventional medicine with alternative treatments, those precious lives would have been saved or there would have been better healing and recovery processes. Research has proven that quite a number of patients still do not seem to have a better health and well-being even though they may be religiously taking their conventional medicine. Many eventually get discouraged and default in the conventional medical treatment plan. Methodology and Theoretical Orientation: An intersubjective study using an interactive dialogue, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were used. An ecological framework was used to analyze the relationship between patients and their practitioners and how this relationship impacts on their health. Findings: Most patients are gradually losing trust in the use of only conventional medicine to treat diseases most especially chronic conditions. For most of them, they believe a combination of conventional and alternative treatments produced better health outcome than when conventional medicines are used alone. A better patient and practitioner relationship produces better health outcome. Conclusion and Significance: Effective adherence to integrative and alternative medicine will go a long way to improve health and well-being. It will improve preventive health care and reduce the occurrence of various diseases and untimely deaths.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to gain the understanding of the use of traditional or local and modern medicine in healthcare delivery among the people in Ghana, West Africa. Methodology and Theoretical Orientation: Data was collected from eleven participants using an open-ended and closed-ended question (Semi-structured) questionnaire developed based on a review of the literature. Findings: The results indicated that choices in healthcare modalities by literate Ghanaians included either traditional or modern medicine or the blending of both. Strong influences on these choices were the level of education and related themes, the influence of family and friends and spiritual or religious beliefs. Conclusion and Significance: We hope that traditional and integrative medicine will always be part of Ghanaian healthcare delivery and efforts should be made to integrate traditional medicine practitioners into the national healthcare delivery system.

To achieve the implementation of PM concept into the daily practice including clinical cardiology, it is necessary to create a fundamentally new strategy based upon the subclinical recognition of bio indicators (bio-predictors and biomarkers) of hidden abnormalities long before the disease clinically manifests itself. Each decision-maker values the impact of their decision to use PM on their own budget and well-being, which may not necessarily be optimal for society as a whole. It would be extremely useful to integrate data harvesting from different databanks for applications such as prediction and personalization of further treatment to thus provide more tailored measures for the patients and persons-at-risk resulting in improved outcomes whilst securing the healthy state and wellness, reduced adverse events and more cost-effective use of healthcare resources. One of the most advanced areas in cardiology is atherosclerosis, cardiovascular and coronary disorders as well as in myocarditis. A lack of medical guidelines has been identified by the majority of responders as the predominant barrier for adoption, indicating a need for the development of best practices and guidelines to support the implementation of PM into the daily practice of cardiologists. Implementation of Personalized Medicine requires a lot before current model \"physician-patient\" could be gradually displaced by a new model \"medical advisor-healthy person-at-risk\" . This is the reason for developing global scientific, clinical, social and educational projects in the area of PM to elicit the content of the new branch.

Hypertension is the leading curable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, affecting more than 1 billion people worldwide (Patel et al., 2016). Treatment of hypertension is to reduce future cardiovascular morbidity and early death. Antihypertensive therapy has shown improvement in the incidences of stroke, heart failure & renal failure, however, the incidence of CHD has not been reduced to that degree (The Sprint Research Group, 2017). Normal human BP (Systolic/Diastolic) ranges from 120/80mmHg to 140/90mmHg. Hypertension is the continuous elevation of resting systolic 140mmHg and diastolic 90mmHg BP (Carretero & Operil, 2000). Effects of Nifedipine an antihypertensive drug were seen on glucose, insulin & epinephrine, in the light of Helsinki Criteria, a study designed on non-diabetic and diabetic hypertensive patients. Two sets, minimum of 12 patients (6-non-diabetics and 6-diabetics) were recruited for treatment. In set-A non-diabetic hypertensive patients were kept on placebo first for two weeks and GTT was performed, then patients switched on Nifedipine at an average dose of 23.8\u00b17.4mg/day. When the diastolic BP normalized 90mmHg at-least for 6-weeks period, then the second GTT was performed. In Set-B, diabetic hypertensive patients treated with Nifedipine first at an average dose 21.3\u00b13.5mg/day for 6-weeks period, GTT was conducted, followed by a placebo period for 2-weeks then the patients went through the second GTT for quantifying glucose, insulin and catecholamine blood levels and results were compared. Based on results it is concluded that Nifedipine worsens glucose tolerance and it is a diabetogenic drug.

Materials and Methods: The study included the results of transvaginal ultrasound examination 193 female with menstrual irregularities, aged 18-27 years were recruited in the study. Transvaginal echography (TVE) was performed on the 4th-6th and 8th-10th days of the menstrual cycle, and in the absence of menstruation on any day. All women had the ultrasound criteria of PCO: the presence of 12 or more 2-9mm ovarian follicles and ovarian volume of more than 10cm3. Considering the distribution of follicles in the ovaries and their volume, the blood flow in the stroma, the level of anti-mueller hormone, the ratio luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones (LH/FSH), polycystic syndrome multifollicular ovaries (MFO) in 54 (28.0%) women. Results: Peripheral location of ovaries in women with PCOS was noted in 78 (56.1\u00b14.2%) cases, mixed in 61 (43.9\u00b14.2%) cases (P<0.05), in patients with MFO in 23 (42.6\u00b16.7)%) and in 31 (57.4\u00b16.7%) cases, and among the fertility healthy women in 27 (79.4\u00b16.9%) and in 7 (20.6 \u00b1 6.9%) cases respectively (P<0.001). An enhanced in stromal echogenicity was noted in 74 (53.2\u00b14.2%) of women with PCOS, in 17 (31.5\u00b16.3%) women with MFO (P<0.01). The number of follicles within the limits of 13-15 was registered in 64 (46.0\u00b14.2%) of women with PCOS, 38 (70.4\u00b16.2%) of women with MFO (P<0.001), and more than 15 follicles - in 75 (54.0\u00b14.2%) and in 15 (27.8\u00b16.1%) women (P<0.001), respectively. In the group of PCOS, the average volume of the ovaries was 18.1\u00b13.8cm3, in the group of MFO-12.3\u00b12.8cm3, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the volumes between these groups. However, in both groups, the volume of the ovaries was significantly (P<0.01) higher than the parameters of the control group. The vascularization of the ovary stroma in the patients with PCOS was significantly more than in the MFO. The average value of Vmax in the group of PCOS was 49.1\u00b18.6cm/s, in the group of MFO-35.6\u00b17.1cm/s, in fertility healthy women - 18.9\u00b14.6cm/s, respectively (P<0.001 and P<0.05). Parameters of resistances index (RI) these groups were 0.48\u00b10.03; 0.54\u00b10.03 and 0.54\u00b10.03, respectively (P<0.05). The average length of the cervix in the group of women with PCOS was 43.7\u00b13.6mm, in the group with MFJA - 34.1\u00b13.2mm, in healthy women - 28.6\u00b12.9mm, respectively. The average uterine body length in the group of women with PCOS was 43.7\u00b13.6mm, in the group with MFJA - 34.1\u00b13.2mm, in healthy women - 28.6\u00b12.9mm, respectively. The ratio of the length of the cervix and the body of the uterus was 1.12\u00b10.07; 0.92\u00b10.06 and - 0.69\u00b10.05, respectively. Conclusion: (a) Mixed type distribution of follicles, their number is more than 15 on the echo graphic section, the volume of the ovary is more than 14 cm3, an increase in the number of color vascular signals, an increase in the maximum systolic velocity of more than 50 cm/s, a decrease in peripheral resistance to blood flow of fewer than 0.51 increases the reliability of ultrasound PCOS criteria. (b) In the syndrome of polycystic ovaries, uterine hypoplasia is observed, which is manifested by an increase in the length of the cervix and an increase in the ratio of the length of the cervix and the body of the uterus.

As a result, these disorders often affect many body systems and mostly cannot be cured. However, approaches may be available to treat or manage some of the associated signs and symptoms. For a group of genetic conditions called inborn errors of metabolism, which results from genetic changes that disrupt the production of specific enzymes, treatment sometimes includes dietary changes or replacement of the particular enzymes that are missing. Limiting certain substances in the diet can prevent the buildup of potentially toxic substances normally broken down by the enzyme. In some cases, enzymes replacement is used to manage existing sign and symptoms and may help prevent future complication. For other genetic condition, treatment and management strategies are designed to improve particular signs and symptoms associated with the disorder. Conclusion and Significant: Genetic disorder may cause such severe health problems that are incompatible with life.
