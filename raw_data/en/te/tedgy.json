Infections and irritations occur when the pH becomes disturbed, but you can incorporate a few simple habits and natural remedies to restore pH balance. 1. Wear Cotton Underwear Your vagina is naturally wet and often leaks fluids that help clean and lubricate the area. Certain fabrics, tight underwear, wet clothes, and panty liners trap moisture, which can cause irritation and promote the growth of unhealthy bacteria or yeasts. Instead, wear clean, loose [cotton underwear](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmwh.13344) and use unscented liners and pads only as necessary. Change out of wet clothes immediately after swimming or working out. Sleep nude or bare under pajamas to give your skin a chance to breathe. 2. Use Condoms and Barrier Methods While the vagina is acidic and ranges between 3.8 to4.5 on the pH scale, semen is more alkaline at about 8.0. During unprotected penetrative sex, semen can change the vaginal pH and disturb the natural environment for up to [10 to 14 hours](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8618584/). It can also trigger the growth of some bacteria and make you vulnerable to infections. But semen isn't the only culprit. You can also [alter your pH](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55929-7) from the vaginal fluid exchange during sex with women or exposure to other organisms during oral sex or penetrative sex with toys. A simple solution is to use condoms and barrier methods during penile or oral sex and over toys. Don't forget to wash your toys with soap and water. 3. Stay Hydrated [Dehydration ](https://www.stonybrookmedicine.edu/southbayobgyn/news/hydration)can throw off the delicate balance of vaginal bacteria. Because these bacteria control the pH level, your pH will also change. You might also experience dryness and skin irritation. On average, women need about 2.75 liters or 11 cups of water daily, with one cup being eight ounces. 4. Try Probiotics People often recommend probiotics for pH balance or using yogurt tampons or other home remedies for fishy odor. The idea is that introducing friendly bacteria will crowd out the harmful ones and protect against infection, but research isn't clear that probiotics help. Plus, putting food in your vagina can cause additional problems. However, [some studies](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/should-you-use-probiotics-for-your-vagina-2019122718592) suggest a probiotic strain called Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 might have benefits. If you want to try pH balance pills by mouth, it likely won't hurt. 5. Practice Good Hygiene Good hygiene can help keep your [vulva clean](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmwh.13344) and dry and promote healthy flora. However, you don't need to wash out the inside of your vagina because it is self-cleaning. This practice is called douching and disrupts your vaginal flora and pH, increasing your risk for infections. Instead, practice regular bathing habits. Wash your vulva with warm water or unscented soap, and avoid personal wipes, perfumes, and sprays. Shower immediately after exercise, and wash your vulva and genitals after sex. Monitor pH With Vaginal pH Balance Test While probiotics and vitamins for vaginal health might not make a difference, your hygiene and sexual practices can. If you suspect your pH is off, check it at home with [Vaginox VpH test strips](https://www.diagnoxhealth.com/product/vaginox). If it's out of range, adjust your lifestyle habits and see your doctor. - Diagnostics: \"Vaginal pH Value for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Common Vaginitis.\" - Harvard Health Publishing Harvard Medical School: \"Should you use probiotics for your vagina?\" - Journal & Women's Health: \"Vulvar Care.\" - Scientific Reports: \"Sexual practices have a significant impact on the vaginal microbiota of women who have sex with women.\" - Stony Brooke Medicine: \"Hydration for Vaginal Health.\" Adele Morris served as the editor and proofreader of this blog, displaying her exceptional editorial skills and expertise in the field.
