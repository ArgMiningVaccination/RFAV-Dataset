There are even hospitals that solely focus on homeopathy, including some in Britain and India. Many different types of practitioners prescribe homeopathy, but it can also be used by patients in their daily lives. This is one of my favorite things about homeopathy. That it is accessible to everyone. There are thousands of remedies though, so often it is advantageous to have a healthcare provider skilled in prescribing homeopathic remedies on your team. Homeopathic remedies are made in a very specific and methodical way, eventually diluting a substance so much that it is beyond what can be physically measured. Most often they are made from plants, minerals, or animal substances. These substances are made into a tincture and one drop of that tincture is mixed with 99 drops of water creating 100 total drops. This new mixture is then shaken vigorously while also being tapped on the heel of the hand of the person preparing the remedy. This creates an energetic imprint of the substance onto the water, and some would even say an energetic imprint of the preparer onto the new mixture! Then 1 drop of that new mixture is mixed with 99 drops of water, and so on and so on. This preparation gives us different dilutions and therefore different strengths of the remedies. The more dilute a substance, the stronger the remedy. Usually lower dose remedies, such as 6C, 12C, or 30c you may see in the grocery store, are used more for physical issues. Stronger remedies such as 200C, 1M, or greater are used more often for mental, emotional, or spiritual healing. The way homeopathy works is not quite known. There is only theory, as is the case with a lot in medicine, more than we may think. What we do know is that every substance in our world is made of atoms. These atoms are always moving, vibrating, creating a frequency. Each substance has a different frequency that can be measured. Our bodies also emit different frequencies depending on our state of being and health. Homeopathy's goal is to cause an energetic shift in the body by gently altering the frequency, and with the hope of bringing you back to a state of health. Personally, I have had a relationship with homeopathy ever since I learned about it. I use it for acute issues that come up in my life, including the common cold or stage fright, and also have used it for chronic conditions. I self-prescribed a remedy to aid in diminishing my monthly menstrual migraines and have never had one come up again! Of course, this was in conjunction with many other nutrition and lifestyle changes, but the remedy is what seemed to finally change that energetic pattern for me. It does sound like magic, and it partially is, but it is a wonderful way to promote healing as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. It is holistic medicine at its finest, focusing on the entirety of a person in order to heal, and harnessing the body's energy in order to set itself back onto a course of healing. "}
