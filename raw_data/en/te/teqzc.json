The Educational Programs Committee (EPC) is charged with creating and reviewing educational content to produce high-quality CE for the AAEP. The committee is composed of AAEP membervolunteers from both small and large private practices as well as academia and industry. Membersinclude both general practitioners and specialists. The Orlando program includes invited papers for the \"In-depth\" and \"How to\" sessions as well as sessions comprised of papers that independent authors submitted for consideration. Topic choicesfor the invited \"In Depth\" and \"How To\" sessions are based on member feedback from the 2010 &2015 AAEP CE Needs Analysis surveys. Topic session leaders are selected by the Program Chair,and then these session leaders invite a slate of speakers to prepare the papers that become an \"InDepth\" overview or a series of related \"How To\" talks. Although invited, these papers undergo arigorous peer review process by the EPC. Papers submitted by independent authors are each assigned 3 reviewers from the EPC. The reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Content is scored using the criteria of StudyDesign, Study Quality, Innovation and Impact, Practicality, and Manuscript Quality. Once papersare scored they are discussed by the section facilitators and reviewers. The highest ranking papersare included on the program to accommodate the number of slots available. This year 165 paperswere submitted for the 55 available slots on the program. Non-scientic sessions addressing business, welfare, ethical and industry concerns are also planned as the scientic program materializes. Speakers who are invited to participate in these sessions prepare papersthat are also reviewed by members of the EPC for inclusion in the Proceedings. The peer review process for the AAEP Proceedings requires an enormous effort by more than 50 members of the EPC to create the best possible program for the AAEP membership. Several thousand volunteer hourswere spent putting together the Orlando program, so please thank them for all their hard work creating thisprogram for you. ii 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFrom Your President Dear AAEP Members & Guests:It is my pleasure to welcome you all to Orlando and the AAEP 62 ndAnnual Convention.

The clinicalsignicance should also be included, as well as a clear state-ment of the objective or purpose of the submission. Thestatement of objectives is usually found in the last sentenceof the Introduction. Materials and Methods: This section should describe experimental methodology inthe case of a didactic study or, in the case of a clinical study,should include a description of the population from whichthe animals were selected and how they were selected forinclusion in the report. Data obtained and how they were obtained must be de- scribed. A description of the statistical methods used tosummarize data, test hypotheses, and characterize the sig-nicance of results should also be included. For weights andmeasures, metric units should be used. Dosages should beexpressed entirely in metric units and with specic timeintervals. vi 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSExample:22 mg/kg, q 12 h, IV (not 10mg/lb, BID, IV)Results: Actual results with numbers and data must be presented.When possible, quantify ndings (mean, median, proportion)and present them with appropriate estimates of measure-ment error or uncertainty (such as standard deviation (SD),standard error (SE) or condence interval) in addition to theresults of hypothesis testing. If the data can be well repre-sented with a graph or gure, these are encouraged if sub- sequent publication is not anticipated. If numbers and dataare not presented due to concerns regarding publication in arefereed journal, indications of relative differences betweengroups such as odds ratios, % change, and signicant differ-ences must be included in the submission to be consideredacceptable. In these instances, the authors should submitthe data in the form of means, standard deviations, or otherdescriptions of comparisons among groups in an appen-dix, which will not be published and only used for reviewpurposes. Discussion: Important ndings documented in the results of the studyshould be stated. Results should be related to other workwhich has been done and how the results differ or agree withpreviously published work and why any differences may haveoccurred should be discussed. The practical take home mes-sage for the equine practitioner should be clearly dened andstated in the summarizing nal statement. This statementmay be longer, but should be similar in content to the takehome message at the beginning of the paper. The following items also must be fully explained in the paper: the number of horses that have been worked on, howmany will be affected, and evidence that the procedure worksand is safe. Acknowledgments: Acknowledgments should include nancial and materialsupport for research (e.g. Grayson Jockey Club ResearchFoundation, AQHA Foundation) and technical support forwork performed.

Submitted papers that use compounded drugs or medical devices will be reviewed by at least two individuals with ex-pertise in this area selected by the CE Steering Committee.The individuals will then make a recommendation to the EPCabout the suitability of the submission for potential inclu-sion in the program. viii 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSStandard of Care: The AAEP is sensitized to having people use the term \"Stan-dard of Care\" from the podium. If you plan to do this pleaseinclude this in your abstract or written submitted material sothe EPC can conrm its agreement with your statement.1. A diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clin-ical circumstance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung can-cer is \"a new standard of care, but not necessarily the onlystandard of care.\" (New England Journal of Medicine,2004). 2. In legal terms, the level at which the average, prudent provider in a given community would practice. It is howsimilarly qualied practitioners would have managed thepatient's care under the same or similar circumstances.The medical malpractice plaintiff must establish the ap-propriate standard of care and demonstrate that the stan-dard of care has been breached. Deadline: ALL papers must be submitted as a .pdf online by March 15,2017, 3:00 p.m. E.T.; under no circumstances will submis-sions received after the deadline be considered or reviewed.ALL deadlines must be adhered to in order to have the pub-lished Proceedings available at the meeting. Review Process: To respect the integrity of the Annual Convention programand ensure the fairness of the review process, AAEP hasadopted blind reviewing in which the identity of the authorsand reviewers are not known to each other. Papers will bereviewed, scored, and selected by the Educational ProgramsCommittee. Please follow the blinding guidelines below.Blinding Guidelines:The title page and/or front matter of the blinded version of a paper should contain no references to any author or tohis/her afliation. All unpublished works by an author of the submitted man- uscript should be blinded. When referring to an author's publication, the form of third person should be used. Any acknowledgments section should be removed from the blinded version. Also, please delete any notes that indicateafliation, conference presentations, grants, author or de-partmental web sites, etc. Do not use author name or afliation in the names of the submitted les. Scoring Criteria: One goal of the Educational Programs Committee (EPC) inchoosing submissions for the AAEP annual meeting is tocombine the best available clinical research with clinicalexperience and expertise to meet the needs of our patients.The AAEP Scoring Criteria can be found at https://aaep2017.abstractcentral.com/.Pre-Press Approval: Authors will have nal approval at the page proof stage.Changes/updates in numbers, dosages or inappropriategrammar may be made within one week of receiving pageproofs. Final grammatical changes will be the decision of theeditors. Substantial changes or removal of any data will re-sult in forfeiture of complimentary registration and travel,and exclusion from the program. Reimbursement: Presenting authors will receive one complimentary registra-tion and a reimbursement of $550 to help support travel.Mentors for Authors: Paper submissions by private practitioners and rst timeauthors are highly encouraged. The AAEP has a list of mem-bers in various areas of expertise that have agreed to volun-teer their time to mentor an author who needs guidance.

The aim of the paper is to help themembership put the information in perspective, and to makejudgments on conflicting information. A review paper will notprincipally present original data. The goal is to clarify exist-ing knowledge on a subject and help the membership betteruse the information in their day to day practice. Review papers should generally be formatted as described in the General Instructions for Authors except where other-wise noted here. The paper should be titled \"Review of SomeSubject.\" The content of review articles should be organizedwith headings and subheadings that provide a logical flow tothe material presented. A \"Take Home Message\" is requiredfor a Review Paper. The Introduction should dene the sub-ject matter and put it in context, explaining why the review isnecessary. The purpose of the review paper should be clearlystated in the Introduction. Agreement and disagreement within the subject matter should be identied along with the strengths and limitationsof the information sources. Reference should be made to theauthors who generally support the opinions stated. The au-thor's perspective, including his/her own interpretation ofthe information if it is different from previously publishedopinions, should be included. The end of the discussionshould contain a summary and the conclusion that the au-thor has drawn for the audience, based upon the revieweddata. Abstracts <250 Words: Guidelines for Authors For those who intend to publish in a refereed journal 63rdAAEP Convention San Antonio, TX November 17-21, 2017 To submit a paper, go to https://aaep2017.abstractcentral.com/ALL papers must be submitted as a .pdf online by March 15, 2017, 3:00 p.m. ET. In order to encourage submission of the newest scienticinformation for inclusion in the AAEP Annual Conventionprogram and simultaneously not jeopardize future publica-tion of this material in a refereed journal, the following cri-teria have been developed for these submissions of ScienticPapers that will be published in the AAEP Proceedings. Insuch instances, the published abstract can be /H11349250 words. However, these \"abbreviated abstracts\" should follow astructured format with the same subheadings (Take HomeMessage, Introduction, Materials & Methods, Results andDiscussion) as the full-length scientic paper. Please be aware that the Take Home Message is included in the totalword count. The abbreviated abstract does not need refer-ences but appropriate acknowledgments should be included.Note that this abbreviated abstract format does not apply toReview, How To, or In-Depth Papers. A full paper conforming to the General Instructions for Authors must also be submit-ted to allow the reviewers to assess the experimental design,materials and methods, statistical analyses, results (withgraphs, tables, charts, etc.) and a discussion of the results asit pertains to interpretation and conclusions ( see specic guidelines below for full papers ). The submitting author must include a statement that only the short abstract can bepublished in the AAEP Convention Proceedings.

The earliest studies in the 1960s reportedan abysmal prognosis for colic, and survival rates forsurgical colic described in the late 1980s rangedfrom 39 to 58%. 1,2In these early retrospective studies, postoperative complications included anastomotic failure, aswell as complete incisional dehiscence, problemsthat are much less common today. Historically, apoor prognosis for surgical colic was likely due todelayed referral, protracted or delayed diagnosisand intervention, and less experience with surgicaltechnique. It seems that in the mind of many own- ers, colic surgery is still strongly associated with apoor prognosis. In addition, many owners are con-cerned that their horse will no longer be a usefulathlete if they have had colic surgery. Owners arethen reluctant to incur signicant nancial burdenwith an uncertain outcome. Today the reported prognosis for the treatment of colic has greatly improved. Recent studies citevastly improved survival for some of the more chal-lenging surgical lesions, from large colon resection 3to gastrojejunostomy.4Survival to discharge for horses recovering from colic surgery at our institu-tion is 90.8%. 5Although improved outcome is as- sociated with advanced surgical techniques andbetter monitoring of the critically ill equine patient,perhaps timely referral and rapid diagnosis and in-tervention plays the biggest role in survival. Acomplete, thorough, and timely workup of the horsein acute abdominal discomfort has the greatest ef-fect on successfully treating colic. Appropriatelysetting client expectations and developing a sharedagenda for treatment with the owner should greatlyimprove their understanding and satisfaction in adifcult and stressful situation. 2. Initial Evaluation and Stabilization Careful collection of a complete history, including anaccurate signalment, information regarding man-agement practices, and recent administration ofmedications, can be extremely useful in narrowingthe possible causes of abdominal discomfort. Thediagnostic steps that comprise a colic workup arefairly standard\u2014perhaps what varies is how manyof them are needed to make a diagnosis, and whatcomponents are reasonable or practical to completein a eld vs referral setting. A recent prospectivestudy in the United Kingdom evaluating the assess- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 1IN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURES NOTESment of 1016 colic patients by veterinary practitio-ners reported that 76.4% were noncritical, meaningthey were managed with minimal medical treat-ment. 6The challenge becomes identifying the re - maining roughly 25% that require intensive medicalmanagement, surgery, or euthanasia. Standardcomponents of colic triage should include a briefphysical examination/rapid patient assessment,abdominal palpation per rectum, passage of a na-sogastric tube, and actively checking for reflux.Ancillary diagnostic tests can include ultrasonog-raphy and abdominocentesis. Perhaps the mostuseful hematologic parameters are packed vol-ume, total solids, and serum lactate. 3. Physical Exam/Rapid Patient Assessment A rapid patient assessment is essential to determin-ing whether a horse with colic will require referral/intensive management or be able to be managed inthe farm setting. The assessment should focus onseverity and nature of pain, mucous membrane (andscleral) color, pulse quality, jugular rell time, de-gree of abdominal distension, heart rate, respiratoryrate, and rectal temperature. Careful observationof how the horse displays what the owner/trainerhas perceived as \"colic pain\" can also be very useful.A gastrointestinal cause of abdominal pain is oftenassumed in horses that present with varying signs ofdiscomfort. However, there are several diseasesthat can take on the clinical appearance of colic, butare not colic. 4. Abdominal Palpation per Rectum Despite advances in ultrasonography, abdominalpalpation per rectum remains a mainstay of the colicworkup. In the prospective study of 1016 horses,abdominal palpation was performed in 73.8% ofhorses. 6A careful but systematic approach to the rectal examination is extremely useful, and should not be omitted from the process. It probably makesthe most sense for each practitioner to develop his orher own approach, but the approach should be con-sistent. Specic palpation goals might include thebase of the cecum, positioning of the colon, cranialpalpation directed on either side of the root of themesentery, spleen, nephrosplenic space, small colon,bladder, and ovaries and uterus if applicable. Sa-lient ndings can be simply categorized as largebowel distension, small intestinal distension, or im-paction (large colon, small colon or cecum). In thecase of a large bowel impaction, it is important toattempt to determine whether the viscus involved iscecum or colon. In most cases, the cecum can beidentied by tracing the base of the viscus to arelatively distinct attachment to the dorsal bodywall, a feature lacking in the palpation of the largecolon per rectum. Typically, palpation of a largecolon impaction can be identied by its relativelycaudal position in the abdomen (often pelvic inlet),the fact that one can readily sweep dorsally over thebody of the large colon without encountering anydorsal body wall attachment, and the cecum can still be palpated to the right of the affected viscus. Thisdistinction affects patient management, and couldplay a signicant role in determining prognosis andtreatment plan. If large bowel distension is appre-ciated, one should attempt to characterize the posi-tioning of the colon. Other meaningful ndingsthat could suggest an immediate need for surgeryare the palpation of signicantly thickened smallbowel, or an intussusception. A change in clinical signs or level of discomfort is an indication to repeat abdominal palpation per rec-tum. The ability to appreciate an abnormality onpalpation per rectum can change in a matter of anhour, and repeat palpation is an often overlooked,but very useful tool in the horse that is not improv-ing or has had a change in clinical status. 5. Nasogastric Intubation/Checking for Reflux Passing a nasogastric tube and actively checking forreflux is an essential component of the colic workup.Probably the most commonly made mistake is thefailure to create an effective siphon to aid in theevacuation of the stomach contents, in combinationwith a lack of persistence. Placement of the tubeinto the stomach is not sufcient to determine thepresence or absence of reflux; most horses will notspontaneously reflux, regardless of the amount ofreflux present. A siphon can be created by intro-ducing a solid column of water into the tube to thelevel of the stomach, using either a stomach pump orhalf-liter dose syringe. The tube is then lowered,and the column of water, now contiguous with thestomach contents, will readily follow gravity andflow of the stomach. If small intestinal distensionis palpable on abdominal palpation per rectum, donot administer any fluids via nasogastric tube. 6. Initial Patient Stabilization Typically, patient stabilization is occurring simultane-ously throughout the evaluation process. Initialtreatment of a horse with colic often includes admin-istration of analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication,most commonly or 0.1 mg/kg orally) or phenylbutazone (2.2mg/kg IV). Depending the circumstances, treatingthe horse with N-butylscopolammonium bromide a(0.3 mg/kg IV) might be helpful. Buscopan competitively inhibits parasympathetic activation (via muscarinicreceptors) of smooth muscle cells, resulting in anantispasmolytic effect. It is important to rememberthat N-butylscopolammonium bromide can increasethe heart rate for up to 30 minutes following adminis-tration; during this time frame, heart rate may not bereflective of discomfort or declining physiologic status. The use of alpha-2 agonists in combination with butorphanol (0.1-0.01 mg/kg IV) to control discom-fort during the completion of the examination is verycommon, with xylazine (0.2-1.1 mg/kg IV) and deto-midine (10-40 /H9262g/kg most frequently 2 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURESused medications. It is important to realize thatthe onset of action of detomidine is appreciablyslower than xylazine, a point that is not insignicantif you have a relatively violent patient. It is notunusual for a clinician to administer repeated dosesof detomidine in a relatively short time frame, im-patiently wondering why the horse's comfort levelhas not improved. Adverse effects might includeprofound bradycardia or collapse, so use caution.A larger dose of xylazine in combination with butor-phanol might be more effective, depending on thepatient. If indicated, fluid volume resuscitation is often ongoing during a colic workup in a referral hospital,and is often possible in a eld setting depending onthe circumstances. A common approach is to beginwith a 20-30 mL/kg bolus of polyionic, pH-balancedcrystalloids pulse quality, jugular rell time, capil-lary rell time, limb temperature, packed cell vol-ume/total solids/lactate if available). Ongoinglosses or circumstances affecting cardiovascular sta-bility, such as presence of reflux or endotoxemia dueto large colon volvulus, will influence the need forfurther fluid volume resuscitation. Rapid intravas-cular volume expansion can be achievedwith a 4-mL/kg dose of 7.2% hypertonic saline, butthis effect will be transient, and must be followedwith appropriate volume replacement. An addi-tional benet of the administration of hypertonicsaline is the improvement of vascular tone, believedto be mediated by the release of vasopressin. Depending on the circumstances, enteral fluid therapy can be a very effective way of correctingmild hypovolemia in the acute colic patient, partic-ularly in horses with large or small colon impaction.In patients without signicant dehydration, enteralfluid alone may be completely effective in improvinghydration and aid in treating the impaction. Whatto administer via nasogastric tube is strongly linkedto practitioner/clinician (water, mineraloil, electrolytes, etc.). Studies have demonstratedthat aggressive enteral fluid therapy using balancedisotonic electrolyte solution is the most effectivechoice for resolving large colon impaction whileavoiding relevant electrolyte disturbances. 7,87. Additional Diagnostic Tests Ultrasonography The use of ultrasound in horses with colic is well described, and is certainly helpful in both a eld andreferral setting. Many clinicians at tertiary carereferral practices consider a brief sonographic exam-ination of the horse with acute colic standard of care.The sonographic appearance of lesions causing colicin the horse are well described in the literature. 9 A limited, rapid scan is commonly used in humanpatients presenting to emergency departments foracute abdominal pain or trauma, and a similar ap-proach has been described in dogs 10and horses.11 In horses, identication of recent prospec - tive clinical trial in our hospital evaluated the use-fulness of a modied fast, localized abdominalsonography in the horse (mFLASH) in horses withacute colic, in combination with abdominal palpa-tion per rectum. 12The mFLASH (Fig. 1 ) consists of ve sonographic windows instead of seven,11and is specically aimed at detecting surgical lesions.12 Agreement between diagnostic modality and lesion localization (large bowel vs small bowel) was betterwith mFLASH than transrectal palpation alone, for strangulating small-intestinal lesions. 12 Obviously, ultrasonographic examination can alsobe useful in patients who are too small for safeabdominal palpation per rectum (foals, small wean-lings, Miniature Horses). Abdominocentesis Evaluation of peritoneal fluid has been a relativelyconsistent component of the colic workup, althoughit is probably most commonly used in a referralsetting. Abdominocentesis is particularly useful inconrming strangulating and possiblyhemoabdomen. bowelis typically cell count ( /H110225000 total solids or increased lactate (compare with B.L. Dallap Schaer. Windows left side; Windows right side. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 3IN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURESserum lactate). The increased reliance on perito-neal lactate has likely decreased the absolute needfor availability of a hematology analyzer for perito-neal analysis. If the peritoneal lactate is greaterthan the peripheral lactate, one can usually feelfairly condent that some degree of bowel compro-mise is present. 13The difference in peritoneal: plasma lactate can vary depending on the clinicalcondition; but in cases of strangulating intestinallesions, the peritoneal lactate is often 2-4 times thatof the peripheral lactate. In the prospective studyby Latson et al 13, horses with strangulated small intestine had a lactate value of 8.45 mmol/L, com- pared with those with nonstrangulating obstruction2.09 mmol/L. Although the usefulness of peritoneal fluid in the evaluation of the horse with acute colic has beenwell documented in the literature, it is importantto remember that it can be associated with a fewsignicant complications, such as enterocentesis(sometimes innocuous, sometimes not), or full-thickness laceration of bowel or spleen. Some cli-nicians feel strongly that the use of a teat cannuladecreases the risk of complication. We have seencomplications associated with all methods of abdom-inocentesis. As with any diagnostic procedure, it isimportant to consider the risks vs the benets of theproposed intervention. 8. When to Refer/Indicators for Surgery The fastest referrals, and indeed the shortest work-ups, are associated with the violently painful horsepresenting for colic. Unrelenting discomfort thatcannot be managed medically usually results in arelatively rapid progression to surgical interventionor euthanasia. Other indicators for referral mightinclude moderate or severe hypovolemia, largeamounts of gastrointestinal reflux, signs of physio-logic decline (increased heart rate, respiratory rate,increased lactate, abnormal mucous membranecolor), or discomfort that persists despite adminis-tration of analgesics, even if it is not violent. Insome cases, the signalment in combination with thepresenting clinical signs might influence the deci-sion to refer; a 25-year-old gelding with a heart rateof 56 bpm and mild abdominal discomfort is muchmore concerning than a yearling with the same clin-ical ndings. It is also important to distinguishbetween cecal and large colon impaction, as onemight be more inclined to refer a horse with cecalimpaction, depending on the owner's feelings re-garding surgery. The decision for surgery is based on the compila- tion of all components of the colic workup. Abnor-mal ndings on abdominal palpation per rectum,such as thickened small intestine or palpable intus-susception, and peritoneal fluid that is serosangui-nous or has an increased lactate, are often indicatorsthat surgery is required. Horses that fail to re-spond to medical management, despite aggressiveintervention, and do not have salient evidence ofenterocolitis, might need an exploratory celiotomy to make a diagnosis. Surgery should at least be con-sidered, and discussed with the owners, in horseswith cecal impaction/dysfunction, given that it isdifcult to predict which will develop a cecal rup-ture. It is important to remember that timely re-ferral, thorough evaluation, and appropriatelytimed surgical intervention have likely been thegreatest contributors to the improved prognosis forcolic appreciated in the last 10 years. 9. When It's Not Colic One of the few areas in our hospital setting in whichinitial patient assessment approaches a protocol isthe admission and workup of a colic patient. Allmembers of our clinical team have been trained inthe elements of the routine of \"colic workup,\" whichwe have reiterated in lectures, rounds, and talks.In many settings, and in fact in the case of mosthorses presenting with colic, adherence to a protocolcan be quite useful. However, horses may demon-strate colic-like behavior and have a disease that isnot of gastrointestinal origin, with specic etiologiesvarying based on geographic location and equinepopulation. Occasionally these patients are inter-preted as \"uncomfortable\" or \"painful\" enough towarrant exploratory celiotomy; in some cases thiscould be contraindicated. Misdiagnosis or delay intreatment could negatively affect outcome. Common causes of \"colic\" behavior that is not as- sociated with tractcan include uterine artery rupture, hyperammonemia, andpheochromocytoma have all been presented for colicto our hospital. Careful attention to the historyand details of the initial assessment by the referringveterinarian, as well as the description of the rstsigns observed by the owner, can be extremely use-ful in determining the cause of the clinical signs.Horses suffering from various toxicities can also dis-play signs that can be interpreted as colic, such asjimsom weed toxicosis, ingestion of Acer rubrum ( red maple leaf), cantharadin toxicity, or adverse flu-phenazine reaction. It is safe to say that few ofthese patients would benet from inadvertent ex-ploratory celiotomy, and a delay in treatment couldcertainly decrease chances of survival. 10. Conclusion The referring veterinarian plays a critical role in theinitial evaluation and referral of the horse with colic.Increased awareness and timely referral both playan extremely important role in improving the sur-vival of horses that require surgery. A thoroughworkup and appropriate compilation of all the avail-able information is important for all veterinariansevaluating horses with colic, in either a primary orreferral setting. It is also important to rememberthat there are a variety of colic \"imitators\" that 4 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURESrequire careful observation and integration of allinformation to avoid inappropriate intervention ordelay in treatment.

It can be due to avariety of factors including fetal, maternal, a com-bination of the two, or iatrogenic. In a study byFrazer et al in 1997, 1the most common breeds to experience dystocia are Thoroughbreds, Standard-breds, and Draft breeds. One of the most impor-tant parts of the initial workup of a dystocia is todetermine that the cause of the mare's distress isdue to foaling. Therefore, understanding the stagesof parturition and what is normal is important. Stage I labor is composed of the mare showing signs of abdominal discomfort as the foal moves intothe correct orientation. Proper space orientationincludes presentation, position, and posture. Pre-sentation should be anterior longitudinal with thefoal's head presented toward the mare's vulva.Normal position is dorsal sacral describing the rela-tionship between the foal's back with the mare'sspine. Proper posture is extension of the extremi-ties, head, and neck (Fig. 1 a). Stage II labor begins with the rupture of the cho- rioallantois and is completed when the foal is ex-pelled. This stage should be no longer than 30minutes and when decision to refer to a clinic orcontinue attempting to reduce the dystocia is themost important. Stage III labor is complete withpassage of the placenta.2. Dystocia-Triage Obtaining a comprehensive history is key to initial decision making. When called for a dystocia,key questions that should be asked include the following: 1. How old is the mare? 2. Is this the rst foal?3. Is the foal to term and has the mare bagged up? 4. When did she begin to foal or break water?5. Have you seen or felt the foal move?6. Who owns the mare and are they aware of the situation? Will they want a C-section ifrequired? Depending on the information provided, several decisions can be made prior to the initial examina-tion of the horse. Information regarding the viabil-ity of the foal and positioning of the foal, can beacquired prior to arriving at the farm or seeing themare at the clinic. Financial constraints imposedby the owner can help determine whether the dysto-cia can be relieved at the farm or if immediate re-ferral to a nearby clinic is warranted. To improve fetal viability, having the information needed tomake decisions quickly is crucial. Time is of theessence in dealing with a dystocia\u201410 minutes 6 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURES NOTEScan be the difference between an excellent resultand a dead foal. When you arrive at the farm or the mare arrives at your clinic, a physical examination of the marecan be performed. Depending on the mare's com-fort and strength of contractions, sedation with xy-lazine or xylazine and torbugesic can aid in theexamination. The perineum should be quicklyrinsed with iodine to maintain hygiene and a vagi-nal examination performed to assess the foal's posi-tion. Once the orientation of the foal is identied, adecision can be made as to the next step in reducingthe dystocia. 3. Procedures to Solve a Dystocia There are four procedures that can be used to reducea dystocia. Attempt should be made to deliver thefoal via assisted vaginal delivery rst. The methodcan be used at both the farm or referral clinic.Manual manipulation of the foal to correct malposi-tion can be performed standing with the mare se-dated. The use of tools such as a head snare orchains on the distal limbs is useful to assist the mareto deliver the foal. Care should be taken whenpulling on the chains to pull in time with the uterinecontractions to reduce trauma to the mare and foal.Once the rib cage enters the pelvic canal, the mareshould be allowed to nish delivery herself to pre-vent rib fractures. Controlled vaginal delivery is when the mare is induced under general anesthesia and placed inTrendelenburg position with the hind limbs liftedvia a hoist. The position is useful to facilitate ma-nipulation of the foal in the uterus by the use ofgravity to repel the foal. Controlled vaginal deliv-ery is useful for delivery of live or dead foals and incombination with a fetotomy. The advantages ofthe procedure are obvious in that the foal can bemanipulated without pressure from the mare andthe foal can be pushed in to allow much more room for manipulation. Generally, this method is per-formed at a referral clinic due to the equipmentneeded for general anesthesia and to elevate thehind end of the mare. Cesarean section (C-section) is indicated for dysto- cia that cannot be corrected vaginally. C-section isperformed mare incision. Indications forthis procedure include severely malpositioned fe-tuses, abnormal birth canal, or to decrease reproduc-tive tract trauma. Although there are manycomplications that can arise with a C-section, maresthat underwent the surgery had an 80-85% dis-charge rate from the hospital in a study performedby Freeman et al in 1999. 2In addition, a study by Byron et al in 20023showed 59% of mares undergoing C-section had a live foal 1 year post- operatively. Another study by Abernathy-Younget al in 2012 4showed that breeding in the same year as C-section, a dystocia for /H1135090 minutes before C-section, and mare age /H1135016 years were associated with poor foaling rates. Prognosis fordelivery of a live foal in years following C-section Fig. 1. Proper foal orientation. Fig. 2. Incomplete elbow extension. Fig. 3. Dog sitting/hurdling position. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 7IN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURESwas good if duration of dystocia was less than 90minutes and the mare was less than 16 years oldat the time of surgery. Fetotomy is reserved for dystocia when the foal is conrmed dead and vaginal manipulation does notresult in successful delivery of the foal. Fetotomyshould be performed by experienced personnel.The complications with a fetotomy are potential lac-eration of the uterus either with the fetotomy wireor the sharp ends of a bone. For example, when thehead and neck are resected a hand should be placedon the remaining vertebrae and held there duringthe extraction of the remaining fetus. 4. Most Common Presentations Most Common Anterior Presentations Incomplete Elbow ExtensionAt the incomplete elbow extension position, fetalhooves lie at the same level as the muzzle (Fig. 2).The procedure to correct this is to repel the fetaltrunk as far as possible and then apply traction onone limb at a time, thereby introducing the foal in a more normal position. The foal's head shouldthen be pulled into and through the birth canaland at this time the foal may be pulled with gentletraction. Dog Sitting/Hurdling Position In a dog sitting/hurdling position (Fig. 3) your rst clue that something is wrong will be the apparentnormal position of the foal that seemingly will notmove. Upon further palpation, you will nd one ortwo hind feet up. The mare should be placed in theTrendelenburg position. This is a very critical sit-uation and should be handled with utmost caution.It is occasionally possible to push the foal back intothe uterus far enough to allow for one or both of thehind legs to be positioned cranial to the pelvic brim(Fig. 4). If you manage to do this then the foal canbe pulled. If this maneuver is unsuccessful youshould move to a C-section. Carpal Flexion/Contracture Carpal flexion/contracture (Fig. 5) is a very common Fig. 5. Carpal flexion/contracture presentation. Fig. 4. Trendelenburg position. 8 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURESpresentation and these foals are generally eitherquite large or contracted to some extent. These canbe either unilateral or bi-lateral. They can bereduced in the standing mare. It is important tobe able to reach the pastern to place a chainaround it. If you cannot reach the pastern, thenthe mare should be placed in the Trendelenburgposition and the foal repelled to some extent tocreate some working room. The chain is thenapplied to the pastern, and the carpus is reflectedlaterally. A hand should guide the foot and therotation should be gradual so as to not tear theuterus.Foot Over Nape PositionFoot over nape position (Fig. 6) is when one or bothof the forelimbs is displaced over the head andagainst the roof of the vagina. Correction is accom-plished by repelling the fetus and forelimbs arepulled under head. If this is not corrected immedi-ately, there is a high risk of rectovaginal stula or athird-degree perineal laceration.Head and Neck Lateral Flexion Head and neck flexion (Fig. 7) is a common abnor- mality, and difcult to correct. If the fetus is alive,an attempt should be made to repel the foal andbring the head around. Placement of a snare al-lows traction on the head while the body is repelled.If the foal is dead, a fetotomy at the level of the baseneck is a good solution. You must be careful toguide the remainder of the neck through the birthcanal so as to not lacerate the roof of the vagina. Head and Neck Ventral Flexion Ventral deviation can be relatively easy to correct if the fetal nose is just below the brim of the pelvis andthe foal is not too large. Pressure is applied to thepoll and the snare can be placed on the lower jaw.In severe cases, the neck is tucked down between thetwo legs and you may be unable to reach the head(Fig. 8). If this is the case, you may need to performa C-section. Shoulder Flexion This presentation may be unilateral (swimming pos- ture, Fig. 9), or bilateral (diving posture.) The fetalhead may make access to the retained forelimb im-possible. If this is the case, a C-section may be theonly viable option. Most Common Posterior Presentations Common posterior presentations are generally re-ferred to the facility almost immediately. Theseare extremely difcult to correct under eldconditions. Hock Flexion Hock flexions (Fig. 10) represent approximately 25% of the referred posterior cases. These are typicallybilateral, and you run the risk of rupture of thedorsal wall of the uterus if you attempt to pull thefoal. If the foal is small enough and there is ade-quate room, you can attempt reduction. Otherwise,you should progress to a C-section if the foal is aliveand fetotomy if the foal is dead. Fig. 7. Head and neck flexion. Fig. 6. Foot over nape position. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 9IN-DEPTH: CARE PROCEDURESBilateral Hip Flexion (Breech)Bilateral hip flexions (Fig. 11) are generally associ-ated with deformed foals. It is unlikely that man-ual reduction will be successful in these cases, andC-section is generally preferred. Most Common Ventral Presentations Anterior Presentation, Ventral PositionThese are generally easy to reduce, and can usuallybe resolved at the farm. It is important to keep thehead straight while rotating the foal and engaging itinto the birth canal (Fig. 12).Posterior Presentation, Ventral Position, ExtendedPostureThere is a risk that the hind legs penetrate thevagina or the rectum with this presentation (Fig.13). An attempt can be made to rotate the foaland deliver in a posterior manner. This will be areasonable approach as long as the foal is notoverly large, in which case there is risk of ruptureof the gastrocnemius muscle at its femoral attachment. Transverse Presentations These transverse presentations (Figs. 14 and 15) arenot common, and are most often associated with acongenital abnormality. The majority of them areventral. It is important to make sure you are notdealing with twins, which can usually be resolvedwithout a C-section; otherwise, most of these shouldgo to surgery or be resolved with fetotomy. 5. C-Section There are many instances in the author's practicein which C-sections are an elective procedure.This is usually due to a pre-existing condition suchas a damaged cervix or a mare with a deformedpelvis. There are several fetal presentations thatwill generally go almost immediately to C-section.Breech presentations are almost impossible to re-duce and are generally deformed foals.

Hind feet presented, thesecan often be viable foals and can occasionally bepulled backward but if too much traction is ap-plied you can get a rupture of the gastroc or theperoneus tertius, neither of which the practitionerwants to explain to the client or treat. If they cancome out fairly easily and the owner does not wanta C-section, then give it a try. Otherwise, go witha C-section. If the head and neck are both backand all you can feel is the back of the neck and thetwo front feet, you can try and reduce if it is asmall foal; otherwise, fetotomy of the head andneck is required for a vaginal delivery or a C-sec-tion is necessary. In this position with the headand neck all the way back it is quite difcult to tellwhether the fetus is alive. If the foal is valuable,perform a C-section. It is important not to lingerwith uncertainty in dealing with these problems.It is very easy to spend 15-20 minutes trying toreduce a dystocia and this is valuable time forseveral reasons: the obvious one is the viability ofthe fetus, but also fatigue and swelling of the birthcanal in the mare should be considered. The lon-ger the events take, the higher the probability willbe that the mare may not survive. Obturatorparalysis is directly linked to duration of thedystocia and fetus positioning. If a mare goesdown on the way to the clinic and is recumbent onpresentation to the clinic, her chances of survival diminish substantially. We make a point to try and determine early in the process whether a C-section is going to be required.On maiden mares that are not bagged up or havenot relaxed sufciently, and are term with a largefoal, the author will generally make the \"Big Foal/Small Hole\" call and move to a C-section in quickorder after an attempt to reduce the dystocia byputting the mare in the Trendelenburg positionand attempting to pull the foal. This asymmetrybetween the size of the birth canal and the size ofthe foal should be kept in mind, especially if themare is overdue or is not bagged up and has notrelaxed in her vulva. 6. Fetotomy Fetotomy should be performed by experienced per-sonnel. The problems with a fetotomy are potentiallaceration of the uterus either with the fetotomy orby sharp ends of a bone. For example, when thehind leg is removed, a sharp end of the femur caneasily lacerate the uterus. Fetotomy is a very valu-able tool and should be used with caution whennecessary. When initiating a fetotomy, you should Fig. 12. Anterior presentation, ventral position. Fig. 13. Posterior presentation, ventral position, extended posture. Fig. 11. Bilateral hip flexion.

Thehead and neck should be removed at the base of theneck and not in the middle. The pelvis should besplit as close to midline as possible. If fetotomy isperformed in a judicious, cautious manner, then themare will have a productive life. If not, she may besignicantly damaged.

Introduction Respiratory disease constitutes a major cause ofmorbidity and mortality in horses. Timely diagno-sis and or referral to provide optimal therapeuticintervention is critical to the outcome of these cases.The objective of this article is to outline the ap-proach to the diagnosis, treatment, and manage-ment of a select few respiratory conditions in theeld, including when referral for tertiary careshould be initiated. Clinical manifestation of respiratory distress may or may not be obvious depending on the rate of onsetof the condition and its severity. Disease processeswith an acute onset will typically exhibit signs ofrespiratory embarrassment. Nostril flare, tachy-pnea, usually with an increased abdominal compo-nent to expiration, may be present. Short shallowbreaths may accompany the tachypnea. Horsesmay also exhibit a cough or nasal discharge, andvarying degrees of exercise intolerance. Horseswith a pleural component to the disease process mayexhibit reluctance to walk due to pleural pain orpleurodynia. Horses with this condition may alsostand with their elbows abducted, an effort to re-move external pressure on the thoracic wall. Thisclinical manifestation can often be misconstrued asa sign of colic or laminitis.Initial examination should begin with assessment of the mucous membranes. Cyanosis may reflectthe presence of hypoxemia and for oxygensupplementation. Injection or hyperemia of mu-cous membranes may reflect an infectious diseasecomponent. Careful auscultation of the tracheaand lung elds should be performed. Althoughauscultation of the respiratory tract in the adulthorse necessitates the use of a rebreathing bag, itsuse may not be necessary in the patient with respi-ratory embarrassment because it will likely exacer-bate the existing distressed state. Auscultation ofthe trachea may reveal the presence of a trachealrattle, the degree of which reflects the quantity andviscosity of any mucus present. Thicker more vis-cous mucus may not elicit a tracheal rattle. Lungauscultation may determine patency of the lowerairways and the presence of any adventitial lungsounds such as crackles or wheezes. Both lung elds should be auscultated in their entirety. Thisauthor prefers to begin auscultation in the cranialdorsal lung eld, and move ventrally toward themost dependent portions of lung. This increasesthe chance of detecting regional decreases in bron-chovesicular lung sounds, which most often occur inthe compromised ventral lung elds in most respi-ratory conditions. Pleural rubs may be AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 13IN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURES NOTESpresent in the acute stages of the disease process.Cardiac sounds may radiate over a wider area due tothe presence of consolidated lung. Percussion ofthe thoracic body wall may also be employed todetect the presence of a fluid line. Thoracic ultrasound is the most valuable diagnos- tic procedure used in the diagnosis and managementof lower respiratory tract disease. It allows for crit-ical evaluation of the pleural space and lung paren-chyma. Ideally a 2.5-5-MHz curvilinear probewith a maximum depth of 30 cm should be used tothoroughly assess the thoracic cavity, cranial medi-astinum, and lungs. However, use of a linear probeof higher frequency may be sufcient to provide use-ful diagnostic information. Beginning once againin the cranial dorsal lung eld and moving ventrallywithin the connes of the intercostal rib spaces, thepleural surface can be assessed for any breaches inits integrity, which may range from mild pleuralroughening to areas of consolidated lung involvingthe pleural surface (Fig. 1). The presence of freefluid or pleural effusion within the thoracic cavityshould be determined, being sure to evaluate thecranial-ventral-most aspect of the thoracic cavity.Pleural pleural surfaces. The cel-lularity of the fluid present will dictate the level ofechogenicity of the fluid. When evaluating the dor-sal lung eld, care should be taken to observe forcontact and movement of the visceral pleural surfaceagainst the parietal pleura. Lack of movement ofthe lung surface in these regions may reveal thepresence of free air in the thoracic cavity, and thus acomponent of pneumothorax. The presence of in-trathoracic fat and pleural folds in the cranioventralthorax can sometimes be mistaken for pathologicabnormalities. Intrathoracic fat is located in thecranial-ventral-most aspect of either hemithorax ad- jacent to the pericardium. It typically has a smoothrounded border and is of moderate echogenicity. 2. Bacterial Pleuropneumonia Pleuropneumonia is a severe form of pneumoniacharacterized by the presence of inflammation of thevisceral and parietal pleural membranes with sub-sequent transudate production and thoracic cavity. Most cases of pleural effusion and pleuritis occur secondary to bacterial pneumonia. Other potentialcauses of pleural effusion include fungal pneumonia,hemothorax, Determiningwhen pleural effusion may be present in a lowerrespiratory tract disease process, or when pleuraldrainage may be warranted can sometimes be dif-cult to ascertain. 3. Epidemiology Racehorses seem to be at greatest risk of develop-ing bacterial pleuropneumonia. Upper respira-tory tract viral infections, as well as stressfulevents such as long-distance transportation andracing may all contribute to development of dis-ease in any breed. General anesthesia, immuno-suppressive therapy, and poor nutritional statusmay also lead to compromise of the respiratorydefense mechanisms. These stressful events mayalter the host's respiratory defense mechanismssuch as suppression of phagocytic activity. Bac-terial pleuropneumonia secondary to aspiration offeed material associated with esophageal obstruc-tion is also seen in a host of other breeds. Exercise- induced pulmonary hemorrhage may also predis-pose the development of pneumonia. 4. Pathogenesis Suppression of the pulmonary defense mechanismspermits bacterial contamination of the lower respi-ratory tract to progress to pneumonia. Most bacte-ria associated with pleuropneumonia are ubiquitousin the horse's environment, and become pathogenicwhen pulmonary defense mechanisms are altered.The most common aerobic , and Enterobacter spp. are also often isolated, along with anaerobic bacteria such as bac-teroides and fusobacterium species. Horses sub-jected to long transport distances and that areunable to lower their heads to clear their airwaysare at great risk of bacterial contamination of thelower respiratory tract. Signicant bacterial con-tamination of the lower respiratory tract may alsooccur during dirt racing under wet conditions. Pul-monary hemorrhage associated with racing mayalso be a predisposing factor in the development ofbacterial pneumonia. Fig. 1.

Clinical Examination Clinical signs vary with the stage of the diseaseprocess and the degree of effusion present.Acutely, most horses are febrile, anorectic, and orlethargic. They may exhibit a cough or nasal dis-charge, exercise intolerance, and some degree of re-spiratory effort as evidenced by nostril flaring or anabdominal component to expiration. Pleural painor pleurodynia may be evident upon deep palpationof the intercostal space. Pleurodynia may also bemanifested as a reluctance to move, abducted el-bows, or stiff forelimb gait, and may be mistaken forlaminitis or exertional rhabomyolysis. Rapidweight loss may occur in chronically affected horses.The development of sternal and distal limb edemamay be present in advanced cases. 6. Diagnosis Diagnosis of the condition is based upon historicalinformation gathered in addition to clinical and di-agnostic ndings. Thoracic auscultation with the aid of a rebreathing bag typically reveals diminishedor absent bronchovesicular lung sounds in the midto cranioventral lungs elds. Pleural friction rubsmay be present in the acute stages of the diseaseprocess. Cardiac sounds may radiate over a widerarea due to the presence of consolidated lung. Atracheal rattle is often auscultated indicating exu-date in the trachea. Percussion of the thoracic bodywall may also be employed to detect the presence ofa fluid line. Bloodwork typically reflects evidence of nonspe- cic inflammation or infection. In peracute cases aleukopenia may be noted. Hyperbrinogenemia is usually present. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is typicallysignicantly elevated given the degree of bacterial in-volvement. In more chronic cases leukocytosis maybe observed along with anemia of chronic inflamma-tion and a low albumin-to-globulin ratio. Thoracic ultrasound is the most valuable diagnos- tic procedure used in the diagnosis and managementof this condition. It allows for critical evaluation ofthe pleural space and lung parenchyma. The quan-tity and character of the pleural fluid along with thedegree of the brinous component can be assessed.Pleural parietal and visceral pleural surfaces (Fig. 2).The character of the fluid depends on the degree ofcellular inltrate. Strands of brin may be seenfloating throughout the fluid, and adhered to thelung, diaphragm, or thoracic wall (Fig. 3). Thepericardial diaphragmatic ligament should not bemistaken for brin. Consolidated lung appears asareas of hypoechoic tissue (Fig. 2). It is often ob-served floating within the free pleural fluid (Fig. 2).Bright gas echoes may appear within the consoli-dated lung tissue and reflect an anaerobic bacterialcomponent or the presence of a broncho-pleural s-tula (Fig. 4). A mid-to-cranioventral distribution ofaffected lung tissue is most common. Fig. 2. Sonogram of the left hemithorax (8th ICS) demonstrat-ing the presence of echogenic pleural fluid surrounding an area ofhypoechoic consolidated lung parenchyma. Also note the pres-ence of the pericardial diaphragmatic ligament. Fig. 3. Sonogram of the right hemithorax (8th ICS) demonstrat-ing the presence of an extensive brin network extending fromthe diaphragm and lung surface to the body wall. Fig. 4. Sonogram of the left hemithorax (9th ICS) demonstrat-ing the presence of a hyperechoic gas echo within the consolidatedlung tissue. This reflects the presence of an anaerobic bacterialcomponent to the infection. Also note the thick band of brinspanning from the diaphragm to the affected lung. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 15IN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURESThoracic radiographs are useful only after the pleural fluid has been drained, given that the fluidline will prevent proper imaging of the affected lung. Endoscopic examination should be performed to assess for any upper respiratory tract abnormalitiessuch as dysphagia, which may have contributed tothe development of the pneumonia. The quantityand character of the exudate in the trachea may alsobe briefly assessed prior to sampling. Transtracheal wash samples should be collected and submitted for cytological analysis as well asaerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture. Pleural fluid obtained via thoracocentesis should be submitted for cytology and aerobic and anaerobicbacterial culture. In affected horses the fluid maybe turbid with a sanguineous component. Thepresence of foam reflects the presence of large quan-tities of protein in the fluid. A malodorous compo-nent suggests the presence of anaerobic concentrationsgreater than plasma lactate concentra-tion may suggest a septic effusion. 7. Treatment Antibiotic Therapy Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be usedpending culture and sensitivity results. A commoninitial choice would be a form of penicillin in combi-nation with either an aminoglycoside (gentamicin)or fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin). Metronidazoleshould also be added to provide additional anaerobiccoverage, given that penicillin is ineffective againstBacteroides spp. A 6-8-week course of antibiotic therapy is usually warranted depending on the se-verity of disease. Ideally a 10-14-day course ofintravenous antibiotic therapy should be used priorto switching to an oral antibiotic regimen. Chlor-amphenicol administered at a dose of 50 mg/kgorally four times a day is this clinician's preferredchoice of oral antibiotic depending on susceptibilityresults. Response to therapy is assessed by serialultrasonographic evaluation, the presence of contin-ued fevers, and resolution of bloodwork abnormali-ties such as SAA. This clinician also employs the use of nebulization of antibiotics as an adjunct to systemic antibiotictherapy in these cases. Ceftiofur is most often usedat a dose of 2.2 mg/kg once a day due to its effective-ness against S. zooepidemicus . 1 Pleural Drainage Drainage of pleural effusion is critical in allowing forthe re-expansion of the lungs. Horses may presentin varying degrees of respiratory embarrassment.As a general rule, if there is enough fluid to facilitatefloating of the consolidated lung, then it should bedrained. A mild degree of pleural effusion may re-solve without drainage after 48-72 hours on theappropriate antibiotic therapy. Tubes are placed inthe ventral-most aspect of the chest cavity, at a site deemed appropriate based on ultrasonographic eval-uation. This clinician prefers to leave the chesttube indwelling with a one-way Heimlich valve.The size of the tube used should be based on thewidth of the rib space, character of the fluid, andquantity of brin. Based on these criteria, argyletrocars ranging from 20 French to 32 French aremost often used. The site is selected and local an-esthesia is used to block the skin and cranial aspectof the rib margin prior to placement of the tube. The tube may then be removed after 48-72 hours if fluid ceases to re-accumulate or stops drainingfrom the tube. Clamping of the tube for 12 hoursmay be helpful in determining whether fluid produc-tion has ceased. The author flushes the indwellingtube every 4-6 hours to minimize obstruction withbrin. Pleural lavage with sterile fluids is of benet if proper egress can be established. It allows for re-moval of some brin and pro-inflammatory cyto-kines. Horses have an incomplete mediastinum.As such, drainage of one side may allow for drainageof the opposite hemithorax if the mediastinum is notobstructed with brin. Concurrent intravenous fluid may be warranted during drainage if removal of a large quantity offluid (5-10 L) is anticipated, given that pleural drainage will result in a reduction in central venouspressure, reduce preload, and hence, cardiac output.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy is used todecrease inflammation and minimize the effects ofendotoxemia. A single dose of corticosteroids issometimes used to reduce inflammation in the acutestages. Bronchial Lavage This procedure is used in some cases to evacuate theaffected small airways of exudate. This is per-formed under endoscopic guidance. An affectedbronchus is identied and 25 mL of 2% lidocaineinfused into the airway. The airway is then and the dislodged exudate aspiratedand discarded. and targetedbrin removal and adhesiolysis. Thoracotomy and Rib Resection This procedure is recommended for chronically af-fected patients who have a large degree of brin orexudate in the affected hemithorax and are stillexperiencing febrile episodes. It allows for removalof necrotic lung and brin from the chest cavity.Prior to surgery it should be determined whetherthe mediastinal communication is closed. If stillincomplete, the procedure may result in severe bi-lateral pneumothorax. 16 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURESComplications The most common complication seen is pleural ab-scess formation. Laminitis secondary to the severeendotoxemia seen in the more severe cases may alsooccur. Pneumothorax is most often seen in associ-ation with pleuropneumonia, 2and may be diagnosed via thoracic radiography or ultrasound. 8. Pneumothorax and Hemothorax Pneumothorax occurs when there is a collection ofair within the pleural space. It leads to collapse orretraction of the lung away from the parietal pleuraor internal thoracic wall, and is often associatedwith respiratory distress. Pneumothorax is mostoften seen secondary to pleuropneumonia; 2however, may also occur secondary to trauma involving the thoracic cavity or less often as a sequelae of surgeryof the upper respiratory tract. 3 Hemothorax refers to the accumulation of blood within the pleural space, and is most often seensecondary to trauma involving the thoracic cavity.It has also been documented to occur secondary tothe intravenous administration of phenylephrine inolder horses, 4although the incidence of this compli - cation is rare. 9. Clinical Examination Either condition is often associated with tachypnea,dyspnea, tachycardia, and cough. Tachycardia andpale mucous membranes may be particularly asso-ciated with hemothorax. Thoracic auscultationmay reveal an absence of normal bronchovesicularlung sounds in the affected hemithorax. Subcuta-neous emphysema may also be detected in the tho-racic wall. For the patient with pneumothorax, theabsence of lung sounds will be noted in the mid-to-dorsal aspect of the affected hemithorax whereas anabsence of lung sounds in the mid to ventral hemi-thorax will be seen in the patient with hemothorax. 10. Diagnosis Either condition should be strongly suspected with ahistory of thoracic trauma. Pneumothorax shouldbe suspected if there is a history of pleuropneumoniaand may be related to the primary disease process ormay occur as a complication of an indwelling chesttube. Thoracic ultrasound may be performed in theeld to conrm the presence of blood in the thoraciccavity, which will appear as hyperechoic fluid be-tween the visceral and parietal pleural surfaces.If active bleeding is still present, consistent swirlingwithin the fluid may be present. With pneumotho-rax, thoracic ultrasound may also reveal the lack ofcontact and movement of the visceral pleural surfaceagainst the in the of the thoracic cavity are indicated toconrm the presence of pneumothorax. If present,retraction of the lung from the diaphragm caudallyand vertebral bodies dorsally will be observed.11. Treatment Treatment of hemothorax may involve drainage of the fluid from the affected hemithorax to allow forre-expansion of the lungs. However, the decision todrain should be based on the degree of respiratorycompromise and quantity of fluid present in theaffected hemithorax. Thoracocentesis and drain-age should be performed only if active bleeding hasceased. Identifying landmarks for placement of achest tube are similar to the protocol described inthe section on bacterial pleuropneumonia. Awhole-blood transfusion may be warranted prior toconsidering drainage of blood from the affectedhemithorax. Indications for a transfusion include alow packed cell volume in the range of 12-15% orlower, with concomitant tachycardia and tachypnea. Treatment of pneumothorax should be considered once conrmed with the use of both ultrasonographyand radiography. Any open penetrating woundthat may be contributing should be immediatelypacked and an airtight pressure bandage applied.Thoracocentesis with aspiration of the free air canthen be performed to re-establish negative pressurewithin the pleural space. A teat cannula or thora-costomy tube may be used to insert into either one ofthe intercostal spaces of the twelfth to fteenth ribs.The air may then be slowly removed with use of a60-cc syringe or a suction device. The tube may beleft indwelling with a one-way Heimlich valve ifcontinued escape of into the pleural space isanticipated. Pneumothorax associated with pleuropneumonia warrants a poor prognosis. 2Pneumothorax associ - ated thoracic trauma or upper airway surgery car-ries a more favorable prognosis. 3 12. Rib Fractures in Foals Rib fractures occur with relative frequency in new-born foals. Incidence rates range from 20-65%based on retrospective and prospective studies. 5,6 A higher incidence rate in llies has been reported,and the ribs of the left hemithorax seem to be mostsusceptible to trauma. An increased incidence infoals born to primiparous mares has not been ob-served contrary to popular belief. In most in-stances, the rib fractures are of little clinicalsignicance; however, depending upon their locationand degree and manner of displacement they havethe ability to inflict severe damage to organs withinthe thoracic cavity with sometimes fatal conse-quences. Hemothorax, pneumothorax, diaphrag-matic rupture, hemoabdomen, cardiac puncture,and sudden death may occur as a sequelae. 7 13. Clinical Examination Clinical examination of any neonate should involveparticular attention to the thoracic cavity. Itshould begin with assessment of the foal's respira-tory pattern. Tachypnea and nostril flare withshort shallow breaths may suggest the presence of AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 17IN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURESthoracic trauma and rib fractures. The pain in-volved may also prohibit the foal from ambulatingwillingly as well as lying down in a normal manner.Observation for any abnormal swellings of the tho-racic cavity or ventral edema under may also be suggestive of thoracic trauma.The foal's rib cage should be palpated with the foalstanding for assessment of symmetry. Displacedrib fractures may elicit a palpable click during therespiratory cycle. The rib cage should also be ex-amined with the foal in dorsal recumbency with itsforelimbs extended to assess for any visible depres-sions in the thoracic wall. 6 Thoracic auscultation may reveal harsh lung sounds if there is a signicant component of pulmo-nary contusions and thus pleural roughening. Aclick emanating from a fracture site may also beauscultated during the respiratory cycle. Dimin-ished or absent bronchovesicular lung sounds maysuggest the presence of either hemothorax orpneumothorax. 14. Diagnosis If abnormalities on the clinical examination are sug-gestive of the presence of rib fractures, further diag-nostic investigation is warranted to determinewhether interventional therapy or triage to a ter-tiary care facility is warranted. Normal thoracicsymmetry does not exclude the possibility of thepatient having a rib fracture. 6 Historically, radiographs of the thoracic cavity have been used to detect rib fractures, although thesensitivity of this modality is considered poor basedon the location of most fractures at the costochon-dral junction. Overlying lung pathology or abdom-inal viscera may prohibit adequate visualization offractures at this location. Use of ultrasonographyhas been shown to be four times as sensitive asradiography in detection of rib fractures in equineneonates. 6Ultrasonography also allows for the de - tection of soft tissue abnormalities of the thoracicwall such as hematomas. Fractures and their de-grees of displacement can be documented. 6 Ultrasonography may be performed with a 7.5-10- MHz linear probe. With the foal in lateral recum-bency and the upper limb extended, the ribs areultrasounded from the costovertebral junction to thecostochondral junction in both the transverse andlongitudinal views. Ribs two through seven are themost likely to sustain trauma during parturition.Fractures associated with ribs three through six inthe left hemithorax carry a greater risk of trauma tothe thoracic organs due to their proximity to theheart. 7The normal rib margin should appear as a hyperechoic line that should be contiguous with the more hypoechoic costal cartilage. Any break in thecontour of the rib margin or displacement betweenthe rib margin and costal cartilage is suggestive of arib fracture (Fig. 5). At the same time the lungsshould be ultrasounded to ascertain whether thelung has sustained any contusions or for the pres-ence of hemothorax or pneumothorax. Evaluation of the thoracic cavity should ideally be performedwith the patient standing to maximize the ability todetect these abnormalities. 15. Treatment Most rib fractures do not pose a clinical problem forthe patient. Fractures located in the cranial andventral half of the thorax, especially those of the leftside associated with ribs three through six oftenrequire surgical intervention due to their proximityto the heart. Complete fractures of two or moreribs with axial deviation of either fracture fragmentshould also be considered for surgical correction,especially if located over the heart. If either hemothorax or pneumothorax are de- tected, then further intervention is certainly war-ranted. One should anticipate that if a hemothoraxis corrected via thoracocentesis and drainage that apneumothorax may follow as the lung re-expandsand comes in contact with the displaced rib frag-ment. Thus, surgical correction of the rib fractureshould be performed simultaneously to prevent sec-ondary complications. In one report the fourth andfth ribs were the most frequently surgically re-duced pair. 7Many methods of repair have been documented, including the use of reconstruction plates, cerclage wires, nylon cable ties, and nylonstrand suture. 7,8,9 16. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Foals Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is alife-threatening condition characterized by wide-spread inflammation of the lungs. Risk factors fordevelopment include primary lung injury such aspneumonia or aspiration, or nonpulmonary condi-tions such as severe sepsis. 10A few reports have documented this condition in foals, with their ages ranging from 1 to 12 months of age.11,12An acute onset, the presence of pulmonary inltrates in both lungs, a ratio of PaO2(partial pressure of arterial Fig. 5. Sonogram of the right hemithorax demonstrating thepresence of a complete fracture of the sixth rib. 18 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURESoxygen) to FiO2(fraction of oxygen in inspired gases) less than or equal to 200 mm Hg characterize the condition. The syndrome is differentiated fromacute lung injury, which is dened by a ratio of PaO 2 to FiO2of less than or equal to 300 mm Hg.10 17. Clinical Examination Fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia are common clin-ical ndings. Lung auscultation may reveal re-duced bronchovesicular lung sounds with thepresence of diffuse adventitious lung sounds. 18. Diagnosis A history of acute onset of respiratory distress, mod-erate leukocytosis and neutrophilia, hyperbrino-genemia, and an elevated SAA are all supportive ofthe condition. Hypoxemia and the presence of dif-fuse interstitial or bronchointerstitial radiographicpattern along with pulmonary inltrates are conr-matory characteristics of the condition. Despitethe visible severity of respiratory embarrassment,thoracic ultrasound typically reveals the presence ofonly mild comet tail artifacts emanating from thepleural surface of either lung. Transtracheal washmay yield growth of a variety of different types ofbacteria. A viral component has not consistentlybeen identied in association with the condition. 19. Treatment Treatment involves intranasal oxygen therapy.A second nasal cannula may be warranted if initialtherapy fails to improve the PaO 2.11Due to the variety of bacteria that may be isolated, broad-spec- trum antibiotic therapy is recommended. If Rhodo- coccus equi is suspected as a contributor, antibiotic therapy should be tailored toward treatment of thisorganism. Inhalational therapy with antibioticssuch as ceftiofur at a dose of 2.2 mg/kg once a day 1 may also be considered if the severity foal's condi-tion allows it to tolerate the mask for nebulization.The effectiveness of this modality to deliver drugsinto the compromised alveolar space is questionable.Administration of corticosteroids, although gener-ally considered to be contraindicated for use withrespiratory disease with a bacterial component, iswith a critical component of treatment of this condi-tion. In one study describing a syndrome resem-bling ARDS, few foals survived; however, to broad-spectrum systemic antimicrobi-als. 12In a retrospective study looking at the man - agement of ARDS/acute lung injury in 15 foals,there was a 60% survival rate, with 13 of 15 foalshaving been treated with parenteral corticosteroidsin conjunction with antibiotics. 11Of the two foals not treated with corticosteroids, one survived and one was subjected to euthanasia. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy is also indi-cated to address the widespread inflammation andfevers that these patients are subjected to. The use of bronchodilator therapy in ARDS is controversial.There have been no studies in equines to demon-strate their benet in the treatment of ARDS. Thenebulization route of therapy may be rendered inef-fective, given that drugs are unlikely to reach thefluid-lled alveolar space in the consolidated andpoorly ventilated lung. 10Although ad - ministration of beta-2 agonists such as albuterolhave been demonstrated to reduce airway pressure,resistance, and alveolar fluid and in human ARDSpatients, their ability to positively affect outcome ofthese cases has never been demonstrated. In fact,in one study evaluating the outcome of intravenoussalbutamol in human patients with ARDS, the mor-tality rate was higher in the salbutamol group vs theplacebo group. The patient's dependence on theventilator was also increased in the salbutamolgroup. 10 Prognosis for survival in foals afflicted with ARDS is considered poor; however, treatment with a com-bination of systemic corticosteroids, broad-spectrumantimicrobials, and inhalational oxygen may posi-tively affect the outcome of these cases.

Introduction The transformation from fetus to neonate representsa series of rapid and dramatic physiologic changesduring which the placenta is replaced by the lungsas the primary organ of gas exchange. The transi-tion goes smoothly most of the time; however, inhuman medicine (we do not know in equine medicine), approximately 10% of the time active intervention of askilled individual or team is necessary to ensure thatthe newborn receives the appropriate assistance toassume independent existence as quickly as possible. 1 Ideally, whenever a foal is delivered appropriateequipment (Table 1) should be close and easily acces-sible. These supplies should be routinely checked forcompleteness, good working order, and expirationdates. A delay in effective resuscitation may occur ifsomeone needs to leave the \"scene\" during the proce-dure to obtain an essential piece of equipment. Theneed for full resuscitation, including chest compres-sions or medical administration or both, is relativelyrare, occurring in humans approximately 1-2 per 1000live births. 2Cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation in humans has a success rate between 10 and 15%; in veterinary medicine, the success rate is less than10%. 3-6Resuscitation is only the beginning. Own - ers must realize that the initial event causing respira-tory or cardiac arrest, as well as hypoxia (reduction of oxygen supply to tissues) that occurs during arrest,can cause more problems for the foal. Thus, referringa resuscitated foal to an intensive care facility forfurther evaluation is appropriate. The approach to the management of the sick foal will vary depending on the size of the breedingestablishment involved, the economic value of thefoal, and environmental, geographic, and seasonalfactors. All of these factors should be taken intoaccount when advising each owner of the bestintervention to help mitigate any potential issues.The use of \"risk categories\" for foals is very helpfulfor veterinarians in determining the stage andspeed of intervention. The use of examinationforms and foaling charts can be useful as theymay guide future decision making and also beuseful if the animal is later assessed by anotherpractitioner. 2. Risk Categories I.

Any abnormalitiesfound during the examination should guide the se-lection for further diagnostics. II. Moderate- and High-Risk Foals Moderate-risk foals have been described as foalsthat have only one risk factor of maternal, environ-mental, or foal origin. These foals, if not treatedcorrectly, can quickly become high-risk foals, so low-and high-risk foals should initially be approached inthe same manner. High-risk foals are those thathave more than one risk factor. Many of the risk factors involved (maternal illness or concurrent infectious disease on the premises) areidentied before delivery and allow for anticipationof problems and warrant early intervention. In ad-dition to the clinical examination outlined belowthat will take place at an earlier stage followingbirth, additional measures should be taken: A. Frequent monitoring of the foal for signs of deterioration or absence of normal developmen-tal steps (e.g. failure to nurse, urinate, etc.) B. Serum chemistry with electrolyte evaluationC. Serial monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) D. Serum IgG levels, IgG may be rapidly con- sumed in these foals and repeat analysis isadvisable E. Frequent monitoring of body weight (BW). Foals should gain on average of 2 pounds daily. F. Determine whether chemoprophylaxis is war- ranted i. Low white blood cell (WBC) count ii. Placental pathology iii.

Most com-mercial laboratories will have the normal ranges foradult animals and therefore the practitioner mustknow what is normal for a foal so that proper inter-pretation can be achieved (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Alterations in the Total WBC Count Values Leukocytosis can be characteristic for a newbornfoal that had an infection in utero and is rarelyassociated with physiologic causes (stress, excita-tion, and exercise). Leukopenia is considered bythe author to be always pathologic. In summary,foals with a WBC count of greater than 15,000 orless than 5000 and an absolute neutrophil count lessTable 2.

Serum Amyloid A could also be performed as an acute marker for inflammation on high-risk foalsand to the authors experience anything greater than100 /H9262g would be a risk factor for a foal to develop clinical disease. Serum creatinine is usually an unreliable marker for renal disease because the placenta is primarilyresponsible for elimination of waste from the fetus.Therefore, an increase in creatinine is usually areflection of placental dysfunction and not indicativeof renal dysfunction. However, if levels continue toincrease or do not decrease in 2-3 days' time, thenrenal insufciency may be the cause. 7 Creatinine kinase is monitored routinely in our clinic's blood work because subtle increases can be amarker for perinatal asphyxia. This elevationcould be the result of hypoxia that occurredduring the foaling process or placental insufcien-cies and could be elevated due to trauma of birthingorigin or prolonged recumbency. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) isoenzymes are found in every tissue with high activities in the liver, bone,intestine, kidney, and placenta. Neonates can beexpected to have values of 100 /H11003that of adults for the rst 10 days of life, especially after the ingestionof colostrum. /H9253-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity in foals can be noted to be signicantly increased over that inthe adult horse for the rst month of life. GGTactivities in the foal are not the result of colostrumabsorption but primarily due to endogenous sources.The ratio of hepatic weight to total BW is greatest infoals and decreases with age. This relative dispar-ity in hepatic mass may account for some or all of theincreases in GGT values in foals. Human fetal he- patic tissue is reported to have specic activities ofGGT 10/H11003 higher than those in adults. 8 Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) should be in the foal reference range like that of an adult, but withtissue hypoxia, sorbitol dehydrogenase can be ele-vated and is used by the author as a marker todetermine the risk of perinatal asyphxia syndrome. 4. Neonatal Sepsis (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome[MODS]) Sepsis, despite the advancement of equine neonatal care, is still implicated as the major cause of mor-bidity and death (up to 50%) in equine neonates. 9-10 Sepsis refers to the development of a systemic in-flammatory response syndrome to a conrmed infec-tious process. Clinical signs of neonatal sepsis arenonspecic and cannot be used to predict which bac-terial isolate is the causative organism. Diagnosisof sepsis remains somewhat illusive in neonates.Blood cultures for pathogens continue to be the goldstandard for diagnosis; however, clinical signs con-sistent with sepsis in the face of negative culturescan be frequent and is referred to as \"clinical sepsis.\"This clinical sepsis may reflect a suppression ofgrowth from maternal antibiotic administration ornoninfectious triggering of the innate immune sys-tem known in humans as the \"inflammatory baby.\"This systemic inflammatory response results fromthe dysregulation of systemic host response to cas-cading inflammatory and anti-inflammatory media-tors induced by infecting organisms. 2Over the years, as more and more has been discovered about the complexities of neonatal sepsis, promising ther-apies have failed, which is a reflection of the com-Table 3.

As of now, man-aging sepsis in the neonatal foal will remaingrounded on the same cornerstones that were estab-lished more than two decades ago: infection control(antimicrobials, plasma, drainage), hemodynamicsupportive therapies (crystalloid fluids, colloids,plasma, vasopressors), respiratory support (nasaloxygen, ventilation), and nutritional support. 10 5. Treatment Infection Control Antimicrobials are aimed at broad-spectrum cover-age of the most likely organisms. As equine ambu-latory practitioners tend to examine the patientbefore referral to the hospital, they can implementantimicrobial treatment before referral to the hospi-tal. If the referral hospital is just minutes, awaythen blood cultures should ideally be obtained be-fore the start of antimicrobial treatment. However, if the trip is longer than 45 minutes, then it isstrongly recommended that antimicrobial therapybe initiated at the farm. Once organisms are iden-tied, specic therapy is initiated. Antimicrobialscommonly used at the author's referral practice in-clude (remember that therapeutic drug monitoringis recommended for aminoglycosides): Amikacin, 20-25 mg/kg IV or IM q 24 h 20 mg/kg IV q SQ q h 8-15 mg/kg IV q 24 h Metronidazole, 10 mg/kg PO or per rectum q 12 h Potassium penicillin, 22,000 IU/kg IVq6h Hemodynamic Support Fluid therapy is a universal therapeutic modalityused in critical-care patients. It is considered thesecond most important component in equine neona-tal sepsis. Hypovolemia, which can occur in casesof severe sepsis, septic shock, high-volume diarrhea,or acute hemorrhage, demands immediate interven-tion. A balanced isotonic fluid is an appropriatefluid for resuscitation. Some studies have recentlynoted that excessive chloride concentration of thefluid may have negative effects on renal function.Therefore, avoid isotonic saline and use fluids withlower aor Plas - malyte Abfor resuscitative fluids. The author tends to deliver a fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg delivered (without additives) over 5-20 minutes with a reeval-uation of perfusion after the bolus. This re-evalu-ation includes perfusion parameters such as pulsequality, extremity temperatures, return of borbo-rygmi, improving lactate parameters, urine produc-tion, improved mental status, and improved bloodpressure status. Always assess the glucose levelsof the patient, because septic patients are often hy- poglycemic, which necessitates the use of glucose inthe fluids (if you are bolusing the fluids, then theaddition of 25 cc of 50% dextrose may be appropriateto raise the glucose levels out of the critical range).Repeated fluid boluses are not uncommon whentreating septic shock with most neonates receivingbetween 20 and 40 mL/kg bolus. If signs of hypo-perfusion are still present after giving 60 mL/kgboluses, then vasopressor therapy should be in- itiated. 11The use of synthetic colloids is contro- versial for septic shock. One study using antien- dotoxin plasma on survival in septic and critically illfoals documented a higher survival rate to dischargewith use of antiendotoxic plasma compared withfoals receiving another plasma type. 12The author, after fluid resuscitation in the septic foal, will also use antiendotoxin plasmacat a dose of 20 mL/kg with 2000 IU/L of heparin added before administra- tion. Once perfusion parameters have been normal- ized, then a transition to maintenance fluids can beimplemented. It is very important to prevent over-loading the neonate with sodium because of their nat-ural sodium-conserving physiology. Remember that milk is a low in sodium and considered a high-potas-sium source for the foal; therefore, we want to admin-ister fluids that are physiologically equivalent to ourpatient needs. Examples of maintenance fluids meq/L of Na and Cl. The author tendsto give his neonates a maintenance rate of 3-4 mL/kg/h (which comes out to be roughl y1Lo fcrystalloids q 6 h for a 60-kg foal). 6.

Introduction Genuine emergencies are genuinely stressful! Noone can argue that point but clients rely on theirveterinarian not only to deal with the situation butalso to help them make the best decision. Withproper sedation and simple emergency bandaging, alarge proportion of \"catastrophes\" can be humanelymanaged until a thoughtful decision has been made. Recommendations for the selection and application of splints have been published. 1,2An excellent online graphical reference can be found at the followinglink: https://www.acvs.org/sites/default/les/les/EQ_Frac_SplintingChart.pdf. A more text-basedonline resource can be found at manual.com/mvm/emergency_medicine_and_ critical_ care/equine_emergency_medicine/equine_trauma_ and_rst_aid.html. Perhaps the most critical determinant of the out- come for a horse with an extremely unstable injuryof the distal limb (radius/tibia down to the hoof) iswhether or not the skin remains intact and howmuch soft tissue and further bone injury occurs priorto surgical treatment. Proper splinting duringtransportation may well be a life-saving procedure.Having some appropriate materials immediatelyavailable can make all the difference. The mostversatile and inexpensive material remains thick- walled PVC pipe ( /H110116-in diameter) cut into staves of appropriate curvature and length. The PVC can bereadily cut to length with just about any type of sawin a eld situation. It is strong, light and the cur-vature of variously cut 6-inch pipe staves will gen-erally t a reasonably padded bandage. Othermaterials (electrical conduit, rebar, strong-enough/light-enough wood, thermoplastics, molded ber-glass cast tape) can be used but for ease of use andprice, the simple PVC staves are the most practicaland versatile. 2. Errors in Fracture Assessment The biggest mistake that can be made by an attend-ing veterinarian is acting without appropriateknowledge. A rush to euthanasia is certainly indi-cated in terribly catastrophic injuries but euthana-sia is exceptionally difcult to reverse so it shouldnot be done immediately if you are even slightlyuncertain about the \"xable\" nature of the injury.The reality is that many severe lacerations and or-thopedic injuries seem to be far worse than they are.In today's information-rich world, it is both possibleand undesirable to have an owner nd out after ahorse has been euthanized that there have beenother horses with the same injury successfully AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 29IN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURES NOTEStreated. Be wary of offering a prognosis unless youreally do know a lot about that specic injury.Have a good relationship (more importantly, theircell phone number) with an expert (or experts)whom you trust to provide an accurate secondopinion. It is impossible to offer strict \"rules\" on whether or not an individual horse with a given fracture has achance to be successfully treated. (It is a reliablerule that euthanized horses never heal.) Some gen-eralizations about fracture \"treatability\" are possi-ble, however. 1. A skin wound over a fracture is not a death sentence. Contamination of a fracture is atremendously important consideration butsimple observation of a wound is not evi-dence that the prognosis is hopeless. Themost obvious examples are ulnar fracturessecondary to kicks. The laceration is oftenproximal and supercial to the fracture andrarely results in unmanageable infection. 2. Any nondisplaced fracture of any bone has a chance to heal. There is no reason youmust summarily euthanize a horse with assure fracture, even if it is non-weightbear-ing. Not every horse with a non-weight-bearing lameness will develop support limblaminitis. 3. Simple fractures are nearly always more man- ageable than comminuted fractures but location is everything. Comminuted frac-tures of the phalanges are often salvaged,some even to useful activity, but the moreproximal the fracture is on the limb, themore improbable it is that it can be savedwith surgical treatment. In contrast, com-minuted humeral fractures have been suc-cessfully managed with nothing more thanstall rest. 3,4More hospitals today have options for long-term sling management, which should allow for more horses tosurvive. 4. Articular fractures are always more serious if athletic soundness is demanded as an out-come. Articular fractures are not necessar-ily worse if the involved joint can be fused aspart of the fracture repair. This denitelyincludes the carpus, fetlock, and interpha-langeal joints. 5. Fractures with major vascular compromise, i.e., true loss of blood supply, are nearlyalways fatal but a dramatic quantity of vis-ible blood does not equate to loss of vascu-larity. Fracture severity does not typicallycorrelate with hemorrhage. 3. Errors in Wound Management Wound management is usually very difcult in aseriously injured horse. If you have a truly severefracture that will require emergency surgery it willbe nearly impossible to do a meaningful debride- ment. Valuable time and resources will be spentattempting a procedure that will need to be re-peated. It is probably wiser in such instances towrap the site up in an antiseptic soaked gauze andship to a referral facility as quickly as possible.Broad spectrum antimicrobials should be adminis-tered intravenously if a wound is evident in a horsewith a suspected fracture. 4. Errors With Splinted Coaptation The most common errors with a splinted bandageare listed below: Applying Too Much Bandage Material An excessively heavy splint (e.g., a 2 /H110034) will often make the limb more cumbersome and possibly serveto worsen the situation. Do your best to get appro-priate material. Excess bandage material addsweight to the limb and makes it more awkward forthe horse to move. Use just enough padding toallow a tightly wrapped bandage not to act as atourniquet. The outdated concept that a RobertJones Bandage needs to be 3-5 times the diameter ofthe limb is not sound, especially when splints areused. The mechanical value of a splint is dimin-ished the farther it is placed away from the limb.If you use splints, make the bandage light enough toget the splints closer to the skin, but thick enough toprevent trauma from the splint to the skin/soft tis-sues. Interestingly, there is a recent publicationusing a bandaging model that supports the mechan-ical concept that the splint should be close to theskin surface. 5 Using Elastic Tape Using elastic tape for attaching a splint will nearlyalways result in the splint shifting/slipping. Bothelastic adhesive (e.g. Elastikon) or self adhesive (Ve-trap), bandage material are good for incorporatinginto the bandage itself, but splints should be se-curely attached with non-elastic material such asduct tape or packing tape. If multiple staves areplaced around the limb, metal hose clamps also canassist to help compress the splints against the pad-ded bandage and hold them in alignment. Incorrect Length of a Splint Use of a splint that is too short or too long may leadto more harm than good. A good principle is tostabilize the joint above and the joint below theinjury. The most common error for cannon bone,carpal, tarsal, radial, and tibial fractures is not tohave the splint reach the ground. If the splint doesnot reach the ground, motion and gravity will tendto shift it down. Incorrect Placement of Splint(s) Splinting the incorrect side of the lower limb can beavoided if you remember to apply at least one of yoursplints to the convex or \"open\" side of the injury, i.e., 30 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE PROCEDURESif the fetlock is deviated laterally (valgus),place at least one splint on the medial side andincorporate the foot. For severe carpal/tarsal, ra-dial and tibial fractures always have the splint incontact with the shoulder/pelvis. In severe lower limb injuries (e.g., traumatic dis- ruptions of the suspensory apparatus, comminutedphalangeal fractures), the splint can be used to holdthe bones \"stacked\" vertically as well as possible.A Kimzey Lifesaver splint is easiest if you have itbut a simple dorsal PVC splint over a light bandagewith the heel taped up to it will work well. Pulling/holding the heel up with the metacarpus and pha-langes aligned simulates the position of the Kimzeyand is quick and practical. Another major error to avoid is failure to splint the carpus of a horse with a fractured ulna. Splint-ing for radial and tibial fractures will afford modeststability and only slightly relieve anxiety but a horsewith a properly splinted ulnar fracture will immedi-ately relax and be able to maneuver itself with somecondence. 5. Errors in Transportation The most common error when shipping an injuredhorse is to give the horse \"as much room as possible\"in the trailer/van. Ensuring the horse is shipped ina conned area/stallas possible will allow the horseto protect its injured limb optimally if it can lean itsbody/shoulder/pelvis against rm support. The other major shipping error is often made with foal fractures. Foals fatigue quickly when they arestressed and balancing on three limbs. Placementof an intravenous catheter prior to transport mayfacilitate administration of sedatives/tranquilizersduring transport to keep the foal quiet and/or re-cumbent. Take the time to get the foal in recum-bent position on the trailer and, if at all possible,keep an attendant with the foal to maintain it inrecumbency during shipping. This is especially im-portant in more proximal fractures that are difcultto stabilize with a splinted bandage, e.g. radius andtibia. Protect the eyes of any recumbent foal/horseduring transport. If possible, ship the horse with the injured limb closest to the rear of the trailer/van. Smooth accel-eration (loading the south end of a horse headednorth) is easy. Smooth braking is not alwayspossible.Summary Most mistakes concerning emergency managementof orthopedic injuries are made because decisionsand actions are made too quickly. The clinician isalways in a high stress situation where the owner isexpecting rapid action. The problem is that rapidactions are not always the best action. The clini-cian should always attempt to quickly stabilize andcomfort the patient (and owner) but make no \"nal\"decision, i.e., euthanasia, until options for treatmentare at least considered and discussed. It may givesome immediate solace to an owner to hear that\"nothing can be done for your horse\" but today'sworld is such that many owners will later discoverinformation that may make them question that de-cision. It is fair to say that we, as veterinarians,have led to the continued public perception that anyseriously injured horse \"needs\" to be euthanized.Education of the public should eventually result inthe understanding that practical considerations($$$) are the foremost reason to euthanize horses.It is absolutely true that some injuries are so painfuland debilitating that our current techniques cannotmanage them successfully but we need to have de-cision making evolve alongside improvingtechniques.

Introduction Understanding the structure and function of theequine mouth assists veterinarians in recognizingpathology and formulating dental treatment plans.Equine teeth are hypsodont in nature so they areconstantly changing through continued eruptionand response to wear or trauma. A thoroughknowledge of tooth development and wear enablesclinicians to optimize oral cavity function in individ-ual horses and avoid causing iatrogenic damage tothe teeth and associated structures. One must re-alize that there is no \"ideal\" equine mouth and theprimary goals of equine dentistry are to minimizepain and maintain function, not to try to shape theteeth to some pre-dened paradigm. The equine mouth is uniquely adapted for acqui- sition and initial processing of nutrients to fuel thebody. The teeth, gingiva, tongue, palate, andcheeks all play a role in the process of masticationand transport of a food bolus to the pharynx. Al-though we often think of the oral cavity as having alarge empty space similar to a cave, the tongue llsmost of the oral cavity between the dental arcades.The cheeks maintain contact with the lateral as-pects of the teeth. Because of the proximity of thesoft tissues to the teeth, sharp edges on the teeth cancause trauma to the adjacent soft tissues. It isimportant to understand how the components of the oral cavity function together. This discussion of oral anatomy begins with the structural anatomy of the equine tooth, reducing itto its component parts, their formation, and rela-tionship to each other. Then, the architecture andfunction of supporting structures of the tooth areconsidered. Finally, we examine the spatial ar-rangement of teeth and their supporting structureswithin the head to understand their functional in-teractions. Recently, several authors have writtenexcellent reviews of pertinent equine dental anat-omy. 1,2The overall objective of this paper is to review the oral anatomy and physiology of the horseto provide information veterinarians in generalpractice can use to administer better dental care. Primary Objectives Understand the structure of the dental pulp system, how the hard dental tissues formaround it, and why this is important duringodontoplasty (floating) procedures. Understand how the timing and order of teeth eruption is important and how it can be relatedto pathologic processes. Understand the three-dimensional arrange- ment of the teeth in relation to the temporo- 32 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CARE NOTESmandibular joint and how this is used clinically in the maintenance of function. Understand how the hypsodont nature of equine teeth is related to wear and continuederuption of the cheek teeth and incisors. Understand the basic defense and repair mechanisms of the teeth and their supportingstructures to be able to use this information todevelop and implement nonharmful treatmentprotocols. 2. Denitions Before the anatomy of the oral cavity is examined indetail, some basic dental terms should be dened 3,4: Apical: A term used to denote a direction toward the root tip. Occlusal: The table or grinding surface of the tooth. Coronal: Direction toward the crown.Proximal (interproximal): Surfaces facing to- ward adjoining teeth within the same jaw quad-rant or dental arch. Mesial*: The proximal surface facing toward the median line. Distal*: The proximal surface facing away from the median line of the face. Vestibular: The preferred term for the surface of the tooth facing the vestibule or lips; buccal andlabial are acceptable alternatives. Lingual: The surface of a mandibular or maxil- lary tooth facing the tongue (the term \"palatal\"is often used to refer to the same surface ofmaxillary cheek teeth). Anisognathous: The condition of having unequal jaw widths in which the mandibular molar oc-clusal zone is narrower than the maxillary counterpart Modied Triadan system: The preferred compos- ite numbering system for the teeth of a horse inwhich the four dental arcades are numbered100 (upper right), 200 (upper left), 300 (lowerleft) and 400 (lower right) and the teeth arenumbered from 1 to 11 starting with the centralincisor and proceeding to the 3rd molar. Forexample, lower right 2nd premolar is numbered406. Deciduous teeth are numbered similarlybut the dental arcades are numbered 500 (upperright), 600 (upper left), 700 (lower left) and 800(lower right) (Fig. 1). *Note: some authors do not consider mesial and distal to be appropriate terms in equids due to thelack of a complete dental arch in these species; 5 however, the American Veterinary Dental Collegeconsiders the terms appropriate while recognizingthat most veterinary species lack a complete dentalarch. 3. Equine Oral Structural Anatomy Equine teeth are similar to teeth of other domesticanimal species and humans as they are all composedof pulp, dentin, enamel, and cementum. Horses,however, are unique in that all three of the miner-alized dental tissues (cementum, enamel, and den-tin) are exposed on the clinical crown of a tooth inwear, whereas only enamel is exposed on the normalbrachydont tooth. The pulp is the most interior portion of the tooth and is composed of veins, arteries, lymphatics, nervebers, connective tissue, and undifferentiated stemcells. 5,6The pulp \"heart and brain\" of the Fig. 1.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 33BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREtooth as it is the connection of the tooth to the headthrough the nervous and circulatory systems. Thepulp system in the horse is composed of individualpulp horns connected to a common pulp chambernear the roots. One or more root canals then tra-verse the roots and exit at the apical foramen orapex (Fig. 2). The pulp comprises a large percent-age of the volume of a tooth, and is surrounded onlyby a thin shell of mineralized tissues in the younghorse. The number of pulp horns per tooth remainsconstant though their height and diameter de-creases with age due to the deposition of secondarydentin. Incisors, canines, and rst premolar teeth have a single pulp horn although the pulp horns of incisorscan sometimes be divided into two horns occlusallydue to a prominent infundibulum. 1The third and fourth premolars (Triadan 07 and 08) and rst and second molars (Triadan 09 and 10) each have vepulp (Triadan 06) andmandibular third molars 311 pulp horns, and the maxillary third molars(Triadan 111 and 211) have six or seven pulphorns. 7,8(Fig. 3 ) Counting the incisors and cheek teeth arcades, a typical horse has at least 140 pulphorns potentially vulnerable to damage. In a re-cent study, two thirds of horses over 15 years stillhad teeth with an open apex and all horses in thisstudy, including horses up to 27 years of age, hadpersistent root canals despite an apparently \"closed\"apex in all horses greater than 23 years of age. 9 In contrast, the apices of the teeth of cats and dogshave been found to be radiographically \"closed\" by10-11 months of age in most cases. 10,11The open apex leads to a better blood supply to the equine tooth for a longer period of time, which might allowfor a better reparative response to trauma. The pulp serves as a nutrient delivery system for the tooth to support the physiologic and reparativefunctions of the odontoblasts, a sensory organ to detect external stimuli, and as an immune center forthe recognition and processing of antigens. 12When existing odontoblasts are damaged, undifferentiated stem cells in the pulp give rise to new odontoblasts,which aid in repair of a tooth by the deposition oftertiary dentin. 6Because the pulp system is imme - diately surrounded by odontoblasts and both tissuesare derived from the same embryologic stem cells,this duo of dental components is often referred to asthe dentin-pulp complex. Although a tooth has aviable pulp, it is a living structure that has thecapability of constant change through normal phys-iologic processes or in response to external stimuli. Dental hard tissues (dentin, enamel, and cemen- tum) surround the pulp and are arranged in a lay-ered manner (Fig. 4). Odontoblasts produce dentin Fig. 2. Divisions of the pulp system (red) of an equine maxillarycheek tooth in a young horse. Fig. 3. Endodontic numbering system for maxillary and man-dibular cheek teeth in horses.

There are four major types ofdentin in the equine is a very thinlayer of an unmineralized dentin matrix termed pre-dentin between dentin and theodontoblasts. The mineralization of the predentinlayer occurs at approximately the same rate as theproduction of new predentin. 6Primary dentin is produced during the initial development of the tooth. Production of primary dentin ceases aroundthe time period that the tooth erupts through thegingiva. Regular secondary dentin is produced pe-ripheral to the pulp horns from this point onward asa normal, physiological process and is, morphologi-cally, an extension of primary dentin. Deposition ofirregular secondary dentin is also a physiologicalprocess. It is produced similarly to regular second-ary dentin but is found subocclusally near the tip ofeach pulp horn. Irregular secondary dentin hasfewer tubules so is less porous than regular second-ary dentin, an additional mechanism to protect thepulp from damage due to tooth attrition. In con-trast, tertiary dentin is not physiologic. Damagedodontoblasts or replacement cells from the pulp pro-duce tertiary dentin in an attempt to protect thepulp system in response to restorative dental proce-dures, caries, or trauma to the tooth. 6,13If trauma to a tooth is severe enough to damage it beyond what tertiary dentin deposition can repair, the irrevers-ible pulpitis can result in death of the odontoblasts.Death of the odontoblasts results in cessation ofproduction of secondary dentin. This can be seenclinically on radiographs of incisors or canine teethin which one of a pair of complementary teeth has awider pulp horn indicating that production of dentinhad ceased in that tooth at some point in the past.Radiographic evaluation of individual pulp horns ina cheek tooth is usually not possible due to super-imposition of the pulp horns and enamel folds withinthe tooth. However, differences in pulp horn diam-eter indicative of pulpitis or pulp necrosis can beobserved with computed tomography or magneticresonance imaging of diseased teeth, although thesemodalities are infrequently used clinically to detectearly pulp disease (Fig. 5). 14,15 Odontoblast cell bodies extend pro- cesses through tubules extend peripherally tothe amelodentinal junction (Fig. 6). The dentinaltubules in the horse are covered peripherally byenamel throughout the length of the clinical andreserve crown. The role of the odontoblast pro-cesses and tubules in the equine tooth is not certainalthough they are likely involved in transport ofnutrients through the dentin as well as transmis-sion of external stimuli to nerves in the pulp. Dentin is more mineralized (70%) than cementum (60%) but less quickly than enamel, contrib-uting to the \"rough\" occlusal surface important for grinding brous feed material. Secondary dentin isrecognizable on the occlusal surface of a tooth dueto its tendency to be a dark brown color from theuptake of plant pigments. A surfacedecreasing the permeability of the dentin to sub-stances that might otherwise traversethe dentinal tubules and traumatize the pulp. 12 Fig. 5.

Arrangement of pulp, odontoblast cell bodies, dentin, THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREEnamel is the hardest substance in the body and is the most mineralized tooth substance. Enamel ispresent external to the dentin in what is called theperipheral enamel ribbon. Enamel is also found inall incisors and maxillary cheek teeth as an invagi-nation from the occlusal surface called the infundib-ulum (Figs. 4 and 7). The infundibulum of incisorsis also referred to as the \"cup\" and is used as an aidin determining the approximate age of a horse.It extends apically a variable distance from the oc-clusal surface and will eventually disappear withnormal tooth wear. Each maxillary cheek toothhas two infundibula. The infundibula form to in-crease the amount of enamel present on the occlusalsurface to improve wear resistance of the tooth (Fig.7). Mandibular cheek teeth lack infundibula buthave extra enamel on the occlusal surface through amore extensive pattern of infolding of the peripheralenamel ribbon than is present in maxillary cheekteeth. 8(Fig. 8 ) Because enamel is not grossly pres- ent in the root region of teeth, once a tooth wears tothis level it will wear more quickly. Similarly, oncea maxillary cheek tooth wears past the infundibularenamel, the tooth will tend to \"cup\" out with weargiven that there is no longer any enamel protecting the central portion of the tooth from wear. Type 1 enamel predominates in the maxillary cheek teeth and Type 2 enamel predominates in theincisors. 16Mandibular cheek teeth are composed of a mixture of Type 1 and Type 2 enamel, although Type 2 predominates. Type 1 enamel prisms andinterprismatic plates have a regular arrangementthat is more or less perpendicular to the occlusalsurface, giving it superior resistance to wear. Type2 enamel contains prisms that are arranged morethree dimensionally, giving it more resistance tofracture from shearing forces. The predominanceof Type 1 vs Type 2 enamel in the maxillary cheekteeth and incisors, respectively, and a blend of Type1 and Type 2 enamel in mandibular cheek teethgives each type of tooth the best structure for itsintended function. 16Enamel is the only one of the trio of dental hard tissues that has no capacity to regenerate. Enamel, because of its hardness, wears more slowly than dentin and so represents the \"ridges,\" asopposed to the dentinal \"valleys,\" on the occlusalsurface of the tooth. The resulting roughness of theocclusal surface facilitates grinding of feed material,particularly forages. If the occlusal surface of acheek teeth arcade were smooth, which can occuriatrogenically through odontoplasty that is too ag-gressive, the opposing teeth can no longer properlyprocess forage until some degree of \"roughness\" ofthe occlusal surface is restored through dentinalwear. Enamel is very brittle due to its high min-eral content. However, it is protected in much thesame manner as safety glass in a vehicle windshieldgiven that the peripheral enamel ribbon is sand-wiched between dentin internally and cementumexternally. Cementum is found external to the enamel, pe- ripherally, and is a hard-tissue histologically similarto bone that serves as an attachment point by whichthe periodontal ligament anchors a tooth to the den-tal alveolus or socket. Cementum is also the sub-stance that lls the infundibulum of incisors andmaxillary cheek teeth. A study of cemental llingin the maxillary cheek teeth found that 22% of theinfundibula examined exhibited degree of ce-mental hypoplasia, had caries normal cementum. 17 Infundibular cemental hypoplasia and other defectsleave a void in the tooth that can pack with feedmaterial which subsequently may undergo bacterialfermentation. This process leads to progressive de-mineralization of the inorganic dental tissues. 18 Mild-to-moderate infundibular caries may ormay not destroy the infundibular enamel can pre-dispose an affected tooth to fracture. Severe in-fundibular caries can progress through theinfundibular enamel to the den-tinal tubules and causing a near-pulp exposure, orcan erode completely through the dentin to the pulp Fig. 7. Peripheral and infundibular enamel in a maxillary cheektooth. Fig. 8. Peripheral enamel folding in a mandibular cheek toothdemonstrating high degree of infolding.

In fact, additional ce-mentum is produced immediately subgingivally, ex-cept on the interproximal faces, given that the toothcontinually erupts so that the cementum layer isthicker around the clinical or erupted crown. 19 Cementum has the capacity for regeneration andcan be deposited in excess (hypercementosis) in re-sponse tooth resorption andhypercementosis). The periodontium consists of the components that anchor a tooth into the bone of the jaws. The peri-odontium is made up of the alveolar bone, periodon-tal ligament, gingiva, and cementum. Because thecementum is histologically similar to bone, it makessense that the periodontal ligament attaches alveo-lar bone to \"bone\" (cementum). The periodontal lig-ament is made up of bers that attach at variousangles and make the tooth resistant to many forcesincluding vertical extrusion forces such as thosecommonly applied during tooth extraction. Theperiodontal ligament also becomes more organizedapically as a horse ages such that geriatric teethwith a decreased reserve crown are supported by astronger periodontal ligament attachment makingthe root tips more difcult to extract. 20Structur - ally, the periodontal ligament has a network of bloodvessels within three specic arrangements with col-lagen bers that respond to differing forces duringmastication: 1) to help maintain blood flow despitemasticatory stresses, 2) to resist mechanical tractionforces, and 3) to provide a hemodynamic cushion toprocess compression forces. 21In addition, due to their hypsodont nature, the periodontal ligament ofequids must constantly remodel to allow for contin-ued eruption of the reserve crown. The periodontal ligament is protected coronally by the gingiva. Gingiva is specialized tissue that sur-rounds each tooth. Although it has a free edge thatmakes up the external border of the gingival sulcus,gingiva is rmly attached to the tooth through anepithelial attachment at the apical aspect of thesulcus, which limits access of bacteria deeper alongthe tooth. In addition to the gingival attachment tothe tooth, the gingival sulcus is bathed with gingivalcrevicular fluid that contains leukocytes and im-mune mediators that also help prevent bacterialinfection. 1When this dentogingival attachment is breached and bacteria reach the deeper tissues, tis- sue destruction known as periodontal diseaseresults. Equine teeth differ from the brachydont teeth of dogs, cats, and humans in that they are consideredradicular hypsodont in nature. 4This means they form true roots, and most equine teeth, with the exception of the rst premolars, continue to eruptthroughout a nite lifetime. A cheek tooth in thehorse has no root development at the time of erup- tion. The tooth continues to lengthen for approxi-mately 1-2 years after eruption after which timethere is no net length gain of the tooth and the toothactually shortens due to eruption and occlusal wear.Equine teeth wear at an average rate of 2-3 mm/year but have been found to erupt up to 9 mm/yearin some younger horses. 1Enamel production oc - curs in cheek teeth until approximately 5 yearspost-eruption. Formation of true roots throughproduction of cementum and dentin continues forapproximately is completed, ameloblasts disin- tegrate and there is no capability for repair ofenamel for the rest of the life of the tooth. 22Equine incisors tend to elongate for a slightly longer period of time, increasing in length for 2-4 years post-eruption then maintaining that length despite con-tinuing wear for another 13-15 years. After thattime they will gradually decrease in length due towear at the occlusal surface. 23Because of the hyp - sodont nature of equine teeth, with continued erup-tion they are vulnerable to wear or eruptionabnormalities that can interfere with proper mas- tication. Enamel insufciency on an antagonistic tooth, absence of an antagonistic tooth due to devel-opmental reasons or extraction, or maleruption of atooth can result in abnormal wear patterns, result-ing in the development of a Class 1 malocclusion. 24 On a positive note, due to this same hypsodont na-ture of the teeth, the periodontal ligament is contin-ually remodeling to facilitate eruption of the reservecrown for continual replacement of the chewing sur-face as it is worn. This process makes it possiblefor periodontal disease to be clinically improvedthrough nonsurgical means in the horse if detectedbefore it is too advanced. 4. Equine Oral Functional Anatomy Equine teeth are classied into four means theyhave both a deciduous and a permanent componentof teeth at different stages of their life. 4Horses have a complement of 24 deciduous teeth and 36-44 permanent teeth. Incisors and premolars to The 12 incisors are consid-ered the \"nipping\" teeth that function during graz-ing to sever the stems and leaves from pastureforage plants. Because horses have both maxillaryand mandibular incisors compared with cattle thatonly have mandibular incisors that contact a maxil-lary dental pad, they are very efcient at grazinggrasses close to the crown of the plant. Canine teeth, up to four total, are more common in male horses but are often present as rudimentaryversions in mares. Interestingly, in 1895, Goodallremarked that \"small deciduous canines are alwayspresent in both sexes, but they are absorbed withouteruption.\" 25Canine teeth are considered to be ght - AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 37BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREing teeth and do not really participate in masticationgiven that they do not make occlusal contact withany other teeth. Although canine teeth do continueto erupt and remodel like other hypsodont teeth,these processes occur at an extremely slow rate.Although in the past it has been recommended toreduce the canine tooth height, removal of the pe-ripheral enamel layer may expose dentinal tubulesthat can lead to an indirect pulp exposure. Directpulp exposure with crown reduction is also a distinctpossibility given that the level of the pulp horn of acanine tooth cannot be determined clinically orbased on age. Premolars and molars have the same tooth form and are referred to as the cheek teeth. The excep-tion is the rst premolar (Triadan 05), also known asthe wolf tooth. First premolars are variably pres-ent and more likely to be present in the maxillaryarcades. Like the canine teeth, they do not partic-ipate in mastication. Premolars 2-4 and the threemolars, six teeth in each of four arcades, are packedtogether to function as a single grindingunit. Three dimensionally, there are a few impor-tant features of the cheek teeth to consider whenexamining the equine oral cavity. Horses exhibitanisognathism, which means the maxillary cheekteeth component is wider than the mandibularcheek teeth component. In addition, based uponmeasurements by Merillat, maxillary cheek teeththemselves are approximately theopposing mandibular cheek teeth 26(Fig. 9 ). These features are important because they highlight theneed for a full lateral excursion to ensure even wearof the opposing cheek tooth surfaces. Cheek-teetharcades often have an occlusal surface that is notplanar but has a curvature in a vertical dimensionsuch that the distal mandibular teeth can seem to beelongated. This curvature is termed the \"Curve ofSpee\" and is very pronounced in Arabian horses(Fig. 10). Horses with an exaggerated Curve ofSpee can falsely seem to have large hooks of their mandibular 11s. In a horizontal dimension, man-dibular arcades are relatively straight from mesialto distal whereas the maxillary arcades tend to bepositioned in a slight arc with the distal one or twomaxillary cheek teeth curving medially enough tomake them more difcult to access during odonto-plasty procedures (Fig. 11). The cheek-teeth ar-cades also have an angulation of their occlusalsurfaces dorsally in a vestibular to lingual/palataldirection that was traditionally thought to be be-tween 10 and 15 degrees. A recent study includingboth normal and pathological arcades showed thatthe mean maxillary cheek teeth occlusal angleranges from 12.5-18\u00b0 with the steeper angles moremesially in the arcade. 27The mean mandibular cheek teeth occlusal angle ranged from 19.2-30\u00b0 with the steeper angles more distally in the ar-cade. 27Therefore, these angles should not suggest treatment goals, only that occlusal angulation is a normal feature of the cheek teeth within certainranges. Extremely steep angles such as are found Fig. 9. Anisognathism and disparity in widths of individualmaxillary (blue line) vs mandibular (red line) cheek teeth. Fig. 10. Curve of Spee. The red line indicates curvature of thearcade and the yellow line indicates an imaginary flat occlusalplane. Fig. 11. The red arc indicates the medial curvature of the distalcheek teeth. The blue lines demonstrate the nonparallel natureof the interproximal spaces. 38 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREin a condition called shear mouth as well as iatro-genically induced flat table surfaces may interferewith mastication. An additional feature of cheek teeth is the non- parallel nature of the interproximal spaces (Fig. 11).This should be taken into account during burring ofthe interproximal spaces for pathologic diastematreatment or application of a tooth spreader duringtooth extraction because working outside of the in-terproximal space will result in damage to the teeth.Each maxillary cheek tooth has two prominent ver-tical ridges on its vestibular aspect called cingula(Fig. 12). The cingula are formed by enamel out-foldings and are the location of the so-called enamelpoints that are smoothed during odontoplasty orfloating procedures. Note the close proximity of thevestibular pulp horns to the cingula, a fact thatshould be taken into account during odontoplasty ofthe sharp enamel points to avoid pulp exposure onthe vestibular aspect of a maxillary cheek tooth.Transverse ridges on the occlusal surface, one tothree per tooth, are another morphologic feature ofcheek teeth. 5(Fig. 13 ) They may have a role in guiding the medial movement of the cheek teethduring the power stroke phase of mastication or mayincrease the surface area for mastication but thishas not been studied. The timing and pattern of eruption of both the deciduous teeth and the permanent teeth are veryimportant to dental function. Additional cheekteeth erupt as the jaws elongate with growth so thatthe mouth is functionally \"full\" of teeth as a horseages until all teeth are erupted by approximately 5years of age. A foal will erupt three deciduous pre-molars in each arcade that will be replaced over timewith the three permanent premolars. Three mo-lars will also erupt to complete the full complementof six cheek teeth in each arcade. The cheek teetherupt in a staggered fashion with the last perma-nent tooth to erupt, the 4th premolar (Triadan 08,also known as the 3rd cheek tooth), erupting be- tween the 3rd premolar (Triadan 07) and the 1stmolar (Triadan 09) (Fig. 14). This pattern of erup-tion serves to pack the six cheek teeth in each arcadeinto a single functional grinding unit. All of the equine incisors have both deciduous and permanent components. Maleruptions are fairlycommon in the incisor arcades. The incisors eruptin order from mesial to distal and are not packed asan arcade in the same manner as the cheek teeth.If a deciduous incisor does not exfoliate at the propertime, it is common for the permanent tooth to eruptlingual/palatal to its deciduous component (Fig. 15).This can result in a failure of the opposing incisors toocclude. When exfoliation and eruption of the inci-sors occurs \"properly,\" the four incisor arcades func-tion together as two units, a maxillary componentand a mandibular component. The maxillary teeth are xed within the maxilla and incisive bones. The mandibular cheek teethare xed within the paired mandibles that are fusedtogether at the mandibular symphysis. The man-dibles articulate with the rest of the skull at thetemporomandibular joints (TMJ). The TMJs are Fig. 12.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 39BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREunique joints in that they allow for both pivoting andtranslational movements. In the resting or centricincisor position, the incisors are loaded and thecheek teeth are separated (Fig. 16). The transla-tional movements come into play in the process ofmastication as the mandibles descend ventrally(opening stroke) and then laterally and dorsally toone side until cheek teeth contact (closing stroke).Finally, the mandibles move back toward the incisorcentric position (power stroke) to complete one chew-ing cycle 28(Fig. 17 ). The power stroke phase of mastication is the phase during which the actualgrinding of feedstuffs takes place. There is actuallymovement in all three dimensions as there is alsosome movement in a rostrocaudal direction duringthe process of mastication. In the \"normal\" horse,when the incisors are in contact in the centric orresting position, the cheek teeth are not in contactocclusally due to a separation between the maxillaryand mandibular arcades and, in addition, are alsoseparated in a mediolateral dimension due to theanisognathic nature of the horse's jaws. In con-trast, during mastication, when the active mandiblehas moved laterally then closed to allow cheek toothcontact on that side, the incisors will be separated in a vertical dimension. In this manner, the dentalapparatus of the horse can perform two functions,nipping and grinding, although at different times. Another interesting observation regarding the three dimensional arrangement of the cheek teeth,incisors, and TMJs is the fact that an imaginary lineextending along the incisor occlusal tables caudally Fig. 15. Permanent incisor 403 (yellow arrow) malerupting lin-gual and distal to persistent 803 (red arrow). Fig. 16. Incisor and cheek teeth relationship in centric incisorocclusion. Fig. 17.

This shouldprompt a clinician to make sure to maintain thisincisor occlusal table relationship to the TMJ in theevent that occlusal odontoplasty of the incisors isdeemed necessary. Interestingly, the cheek teethtables are on an entirely different plane than eitherthe incisors or TMJs. These factors are likely bio-mechanically related to the function of incisors vsthe cheek teeth. The last pieces of the masticatory puzzle are the cheeks, tongue, and palate. The cheeks function tomaintain a food bolus between the cheek teeth ar-cades or more medially. The tongue, working inconjunction with the staggered folds of the palate(Fig. 19) functions as an auger system to transportthe feed bolus toward the pharynx for swallowing.Although these soft tissues are not usually consid-ered as part of the dental apparatus, they are inti-mately associated with the teeth and are prone toinjury by sharp dental projections. Pain resultingfrom this soft tissue trauma can affect the ability ofthe horse to efciently acquire, process, and trans-port feed materials. 5. Clinical Relevance The pulp system of a young horse comprises a largepercentage of the volume of each tooth. As odonto-blasts produce secondary dentin in a centripetalmanner, each individual pulp horn decreases in di-ameter and height. To complicate this processhowever, due to the hypsodont nature of the tooth,the tooth is continuing to erupt while the occlusalsurface of the tooth is being worn down. As long asdeposition of secondary dentin at the occlusal end ofthe pulp horn occurs at a rate that equals or exceedsthat of wear, opening of the pulp horn should not occur with normal attrition. However, a pulp horncan inadvertently be violated during removal of den-tal hard tissue in an odontoplasty procedure as wellas by fracture of a tooth. Recent work has shownthat the thickness of subocclusal secondary dentinvaries greatly among horses and even between pulphorns within a normal individual cheek tooth. 29 Subocclusal secondary dentin thickness in elongatedcheek teeth was found to be extremely variable, from1.87-36.02 mm with a mean of 12.14 mm. 30Be- cause it is nearly impossible to determine the depthof a pulp horn below the occlusal surface of a tooth ina horse without the use of advanced imaging such ascomputed tomography, one must be very carefulwhen reducing the height of any tooth. Pulp horndistance from the nearest interproximal space hasalso been assessed and it was determined that somewere as close as 1.3 mm with a mean of 5.75 mm,and 5.3% of pulps were found to be within 3.5 mm ofan interproximal space in this same study. 31A pulp horn does not have to be directly opened to cause damage. An indirect pulp exposure can occurthrough exposure of dentinal tubules that still com-municate with the pulp. Pulpitis can be induced in a tooth with injudicious use of dental burs. Overheating can occur with dullburs, working for too long on a single tooth, or failingto properly cool the tooth. Histologic studies exam-ining the effect of tooth temperature changes on thepulp using macaque monkeys as a model haveshown that a 5.5\u00b0C increase in tooth temperaturecauses destruction of the odontoblasts in the regionof the thermal insult. 32Interestingly, similar teeth examined 56 days after thermal insult showed his- tologic evidence of successful recovery from thetrauma. This demonstrates the ability of teeth toundergo repair and survive despite signicant in-jury. In horses, it is not known at what tempera-ture pulp change occurs, but studies have shownincreases in pulp temperature in isolated horseteeth after short periods of grinding. One studydemonstrated a 4.62\u00b0C temperature increase in atooth from a 6-year-old horse after only 20 seconds ofgrinding with a high-speed die grinder. 33Also of importance, it was noted that the teeth did not cool back to normal temperature for 5 to 10 minutes afterthis 20 seconds of grinding. However, when con-stantly water-cooled burs were used or intermittentirrigation was provided, tooth temperatures did notincrease more than 2.64\u00b0C, a temperature not asso-ciated with histologic damage to the pulp in themacaque study. When considering the cheek teeth as grinding sur- faces, we think about the 24 teeth being composed of12 pairs of teeth making occlusal contact. If any ofthese pairs of teeth are taken out of occlusion eitheriatrogenically or by natural processes such as male-ruption or malocclusion, the efciency of masticationdecreases. In extreme instances, such as a wavecomplex in an older horse, the planes of occlusal Fig. 19. Staggered palatal folds indicated by yellow and redarrows. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 41BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREcontact are very irregular but often there is stillcontact in some areas. Attempts to \"level\" the ar-cades will likely take most of the teeth out of occlu-sion and prevent effective mastication, despite goodintentions. The normal, rough occlusal surface ofcheek teeth should be preserved during odonto-plasty as this is what provides the ability to masti-cate brous feedstuffs. Normally, the six cheek teeth in each arcade are packed together to function as a single grindingunit. Anatomically, this is accomplished by angu-lation of the dental buds so that the mesial one ortwo cheek teeth are angled distally from root tocrown and the last two cheek teeth are angled me-sially from root to crown. 34Occasionally, the tooth buds either develop too far apart or with insufcientangulation to achieve arcade packing. 35This can predispose the development of pathologic diastema or abnormal spaces between adjacent teeth. Themost problematic type is the \"valved\" diastemawhere the adjacent teeth may have a gap betweenthem at the gingival margin but may be tight to-gether at the occlusal surface. Forage particles be-come lodged within the resulting \"V-shaped\" gapand decompose, creating a local environment favor-able for the development of periodontal disease.Detection of diastemata, especially between the cau-dal mandibular cheek teeth can be very difcultwithout the use of an intraoral mirror or ber-opticscope. 6. Conclusions The three-dimensional anatomy of the pulp system of an equine tooth and its likely prox-imity to the tooth margins should be consid- ered before a clinician performs odontoplastyprocedures to avoid causing irreparable dam-age. Treatment of large occlusal elongationsmay require staged reductions to allow timefor deposition of secondary or tertiary dentinbetween procedures to avoid pulp exposure. The nature of a canine tooth (Triadan 04) should be considered before performing crownreduction because removal of the peripheralenamel exposes dentinal tubules and can re-sult in a secondary pulp exposure. The relationship of enamel and dentin and their relative wear resistance is important be-cause the occlusal surface of cheek teeth mustbe rough to facilitate efcient mastication ofbrous feed material. Because periodontal disease is so destructive and painful, a clinician should understand thestructure and function of the gingival attach-ment in protecting the periodontal ligament toguide periodontal disease preventative andtreatment measures. The complexity of the periodontal ligament and its role in the support of a tooth shouldbe considered when performing dental extractions. Due to the order of eruption of teeth to promote packing of an arcade, young horses should beexamined frequently to facilitate early detec-tion of eruption problems. Equine teeth maintain a good blood supply to their teeth for a longer time than those ofmany other species, so care must be taken tonot overheat teeth and inadvertently damagethe pulp. Equine dentistry, including teeth floating, has been practiced for centuries. Advancements in technol-ogy have allowed a better understanding of a horse'smouth and how it functions. Dentistry is an impor-tant component of the health care of a horse. Aveterinarian must understand the structure of theteeth and how and why they are arranged the waythey are before removing dental hard tissue to avoidcausing damage to the teeth or causing functionalchanges in the mouth. Much research is stillneeded to further unravel mysteries of the anatomyand physiology of the equine oral cavity.

Introduction Many of us were taught in veterinary school to floatteeth, never giving a thought to a proper oral exam-ination. Clients call requesting a dental float with-out even considering the importance of examination.Now it is inappropriate to perform a dental treat-ment (floating) without a proper dental examina-tion. An oral evaluation can be broken down intofour main components. The rst component in-cludes the orthodontic examination to determinewhether the teeth are in proper alignment and ifthere are any dental overgrowths due to misalign-ment. Second is the periodontal examination to de-termine pathology of the periodontal ligament,gingival, and alveolar bone. Third is the endodon-tic examination to detect pathology of the dentalpulp. Lastly, an examination of the oral soft tis-sues is performed to determine pathology of thecheek, palate, and tongue including trauma and neo-plasia. These examinations can occur individuallyor concurrently but should be performed in a consis-tent order to minimize pathology being overlooked. 2. Materials and Methods Using minimal, inexpensive equipment and simpleexamination techniques, the equine practitioner canrecognize dental disease and inform owners of treat-ment options. The oral examination should be per-formed in a safe environment for the horse andpractitioner. This may be in a stall, wash stall, or stock. The footing should be level and not slippery.There should be little backlight behind the horseand shining toward the practitioner, which makes itdifcult to illuminate the oral cavity with a head-lamp. The equipment needed for a proper dentalexamination in the horse includes a full-mouth spec-ulum, bright light source (headlamp), dental mirror,dental explorer (Shepherd's hook), and periodontalprobe (Fig. 1). Each instrument should have a han-dle long enough, usually 19 inches, for the workingend to reach the third molar. Standard-sized,human, periodontal probes and explorers may beused for the incisors and canine teeth. The work-ing end of periodontal probes should be thin andhave grooved markings for measuring pocketdepth. For a more complete diagnosis of end-odontic and periodontal disease, dental radiogra-phy is necessary. Prior to sedation, perform a general examination to ensure there are no cardiovascular conditionsthat would make the patient unt for sedation.Next, perform an extra-oral examination of the pa-tient's head. This portion of the examination in-cludes palpating the temporomandibular joint, the upper and lower jaws, and just ventral to the facialcrest along the buccal surface of the upper cheekteeth. Swellings, draining tracts, or areas that arepainful should be noted for further investigation. 44 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CARE NOTESTo perform the oral examination, sedate the patientusing methods for standing restraint and rest thepatient's head in a dental halter or head stand.The incisors are examined prior to the placement ofa full-mouth speculum. Part the lips and observethe upper and lower incisors as well as the canineson the labial, lingual, proximal, and occlusal sur-faces. Normal alignment of the upper and lowerincisors is when they are contacting each other inocclusion and are level on the horizontal plane withthe midline of the upper incisors directly opposingthe midline of the lower incisors. Note any devia-tions from the normal alignment as well as diagonal,ventral, or dorsal curvatures of the incisors. Thesemisalignments are often due to uneven jaw growthduring development and may or may not requiredental therapy. When the incisors are observedfrom the lateral view, the upper incisors should be inocclusal contact with the lower incisors. A mis-alignment in which the lower jaw is shorter than theupper jaw, thus causing the upper incisors to restrostral to the lower incisors is called a Class IImalocclusion. This can be caused by either man-dibular brachygnathism or maxillary prognathism.The opposite misalignment in which the upper jawis shorter than the lower jaw is a Class III maloc-clusion. This can be caused by either mandibularprognathism or maxillary brachygnathism. Thenumber and location of incisors are noted as well astheir color, mobility, and surface texture. The den-tal explorer is designed to be used above the gingivalmargin by drawing the point of the instrument overthe tooth surface. Normal dental tissues should behard and smooth and the explorer will glide acrossthe surface of the tooth. Defects in the cementum,enamel or dentin may be seen visually or felt as soft,\"sticky\" areas when a dental explorer is drawn overthe defect. The gingiva, mucosa, and adjacent softtissues should also be examined. The gingivasurrounding the incisors should be light pink,smooth, and even along the vestibular margin(Figs. 2 and 3). A periodontal probe is gentlyintroduced into the gingival sulcus at multiplelocations around each tooth to identify periodontal pockets. Gingival sulcal depths of less than 5 mm are clinically acceptable. 1 Inspect the occlusal surfaces of the upper and lower incisors both visually and with the dentalexplorer. Use a 6-in. dental explorer to examine Fig. 1. Basic equine examination equipment from top to bottomincludes a dental mirror, measuring device, Shepherd's hook den-tal explorer, 6-in. combination dental explorer and periodontalprobe, and a long-handled periodontal probe for examination ofpocketing around cheek teeth. Fig. 2. Normal gingiva appears smooth and pink. The gingivaadheres to the tooth and conforms closely to the shape of thetooth. Fig. 3. This horse has gingivitis caused by foxtail plant awns. The gingiva is red and raised. Areas of gingival reces-sion can be seen especially well on the central incisors where thegingiva does not conform to the shape of the tooth. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 45BACK TO BASICS: DENTAL CAREthe incisors and canines. Special attention shouldbe employed with the dental explorer to the brownstained area of secondary dentin that sits labial tothe infundibulum. Normal dentin is smooth. Ifthe explorer sticks into the dentin or drops into thepulp cavity, this may suggest a pulp defect. Allincisor and canine crown fractures should be exam-ined with a dental explorer to determine whether apulp exposure has occurred. A discolored tooth (ex-cluding stained cementum) has suffered pulp injury(Fig. 4). Tooth fractures, pulp defects, and discol-ored teeth should be radiographed to make a diag-nosis and offer a treatment plan. Examine the gingiva surrounding the incisors for gingival recession and draining tracts (Fig. 5).Draining sinus tracts from abscessed incisor teethappear like papules at the mucogingival margin.When an or canine tooth abscesses, the sinustract typically drains intraorally, either at the mu-cogingival margin near the infected tooth appearinglike a small papule (Fig. 5) or along the periodontalligament. Before using the oral speculum to look at the cheek teeth, place a cheek retractor in the commis-sure of the lip and look in the vestibule on the leftand right side alongside the cheek teeth to observethe space between the upper and lower cheek teeth(Fig. 6). Shift the mandibular incisors left andright and observe the point of molar contact of thecheek teeth. 2This view along the space between the cheek teeth reveals overgrown teeth and where there is premature contact during the chewing cycle.Lateral excursion of the mandible can be examinedby moving the lower jaw to the left and right to thepoint where the cheek teeth contact and separatethe upper and lower incisors while the head is rest- ing in a dental halter or stand. The excursion tomolar contact can be measured by comparing thelocation of midline of the lower incisors in relation tothe upper incisors when the cheek teeth come incontact and cause the incisors to part. 3Observing the point of cheek teeth contact identies the cheek Fig. 4. This upper, rst incisor (tooth 101) is discolored (gray/black) and has gingival recession (the gingival margin is recessedapically compared with the gingival margin of the neighboringteeth). This is an indication for taking radiographs of thistooth. This tooth was found to be necrotic and required endodon-tic therapy. Fig. 5. Gingival recession and a draining tract can be observedat the mucogingival junction of this lower right second incisor(tooth 402). This is an indication for dental radiography to de-termine a diagnosis and to make a treatment plan. Fig. 6. A cheek retractor and bright light source are used to viewthe point of cheek teeth occlusion and to determine cheek teethovergrowths that may cause premature contact duringmastication. 46 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREtooth overgrowths that are making premature occlu-sal contact that should be reduced. A second objec-tive measurement of mandibular motion duringocclusion is the rostral-caudal mobility. During thechewing cycle, the lateral pterygoid muscle con-tracts causing a slight rostral-to-caudal motion ofthe mandible. This motion can be duplicated pas-sively in the sedated horse by comparing the relativepositions of the upper and lower incisors when thehead is held in a horizontal plane to when the headis held vertically. When the neck is flexed 90\u00b0 atthe poll, the mandible will move rostral in relationto the maxilla. A measurement is made comparingthe difference between the labial surface of the up-per and lower rst incisors when the head is held ina horizontal plane vs the difference when the head isflexed 90\u00b0at the poll. Failure of the mandible tomove rostrally may suggest dental interlock, whichis occlusal interference due to overgrown cheekteeth that prevents normal range of mandibular mo-tion during mastication. 4Rostral-caudal mobility has been found to increase after floating and occlu- sal correction of dental overgrowths.5 To examine the cheek teeth, place a full-mouth spec- ulum in the horse's mouth. Examine the cheek teethin a systematic fashion, looking for sharp enamelpoints that may be lacerating the cheeks or tongue.Examine the occlusal surface for dental overgrowthssuch as hooks, waves, steps, and excessive transverseridges (Fig. 7). Overgrowths may occur due to mis-alignment of cheek teeth or to pathology in the oppos-ing arcade (e.g., a fractured tooth, a dysplastic tooththat did not develop normally, an age tooth with noinfundibular enamel, a missing tooth, or a widenedinterproximal space). These pathologic conditionswill lead to steps or excessive transverse ridges in theopposite arcade. The elongated tooth is a normaltooth that is not sufciently worn by the opposing tooth during mastication. The interproximal spaces between teeth are ex- amined for separations called pathologic diastemawhere foodstuffs lodge and cause periodontal dis-ease. Food must be cleaned from the space withlong-handled Gracey curettes and lavage. Aftercleaning the interproximal space of food material,tartar, and plaque, use a periodontal probe to mea-sure gingival recession and depth of pocketing todetermine the amount of periodontal attachmentloss. Examine the occlusal surface of each maxil-lary and mandibular cheek tooth using a dentalmirror and dental explorer. Look for fractures,pulp exposures, and cavities. Feel for defects in theocclusal surface by pulling the sharp point of a longequine dental explorer over the occlusal surface ofthe tooth. The brown stained areas on the occlusalsurface are secondary dentin that was laid down ineach of the retreating pulp horns. A clinicianshould carefully explore these areas for pulp defects(Fig. 8). Infundibula should be assessed for decayand care must be taken not to mistake the vascularchannels in the center of the two maxillary cheekteeth infundibula as pulp defects. The practitionershould note if the decay involves the central cemen-tum only, cementum and enamel or if the Addi- tional signs of endodontic disease in the maxillarycheek teeth are draining tracts or nasal dischargethat is typically unilateral. Swellings or drainingtracts that develop along the ventral border of themandible may be an indication of dental disease inthe mandibular cheek teeth. After examining allthe cheek teeth and the interproximal spaces with a Fig. 7. This is an excessive transverse ridge of tooth 107 with asharp enamel point that has caused a severe laceration in thecheek. The overgrown tooth 107 was caused by a widened inter-proximal space between teeth 406 and 407 on the opposing dentalarcade. Fig. 8. Using a mirror to examine tooth 407, a pulp defect of thesecond pulp horn is observed. When a dental explorer wasdrawn across this area it stuck into the defect. Observation of apulp defect is an indication for dental radiographs. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 47BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREdental mirror, periodontal probe, and dental ex-plorer, also examine the oral soft tissues. Use adental mirror and cheek teeth retractor to examinethe cheek and hard palate. Move the tongue side toside to examine the sublingual portion of the oralcavity. Look for lacerations caused by sharpenamel points, foreign bodies embedded in the cheekor tongue, and soft tissue lumps and growths thatmay need biopsied. Record all of the examinationndings, radiographic interpretations, treatments,and prognoses in a dental record or medical chart. Proper diagnosis and treatment of dental disease necessitates a complete oral examination and theidentication of pathology such as elongated teeth,discolored teeth, draining tracts, pulp defects,cavities, fractures, feed impactions, periodontalpocketing, and soft tissue lesions. A thorough oralexamination with ancillary testing such as radiog-raphy leads to a complete diagnosis so that a treat-ment plan and a prognosis can be established.Treatment will decrease patient pain and improvethe health of our equine patients.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction The Dental Chart Dental charting is the process of recording the stateof health or disease of the teeth and oral cavity, andit is an integral part of the examination, diagnosis,treatment, and monitoring of dental cases. 1Given that training, in general medicine and surgery, isprerequisite to the practice of veterinary dentistry,most veterinarians also include pertinent regionaland systemic examination ndings and diagnoses onthe dental chart. The dental chart is a permanent record of a pa- tient's dental care. Completion of a dental chart isthe minimum standard of care for documenting anyprofessional dental procedure. In addition to providing legal documentation of the procedure performed, the dental chart assiststhe practitioner in providing a consistent, compre-hensive examination, facilitates accurate treatmentplanning and fee estimation, and facilitates commu-nication with colleagues and clients. Although most small-animal and human dentists prefer a two-chart system (one chart for recording examination ndings, diagnoses, and proposedtreatment planning and a second chart for recordingthe treatment performed), most equine veterinari-ans use a combined report for both the examinationand treatments. The most commonly acceptedchart format is an anatomical dental diagram sup- plemented by brief descriptions to clarify the ex-amination ndings, diagnoses, and procedureperformed. Numerous acceptable equine dentalcharts are available free of charge through col-leagues aand on the Internet. The author uses dif- ferent dental charts for primary dental care andadvanced procedures (endodontics, oral surgery,etc.) and recommends that veterinarians developdental charts that meet their specic clinical case-load. Given that equine dentistry is rapidly pro-gressing, dental chart templates should be stored ina document format, such as Microsoft Word, bwhich allows for easy editing as a veterinarian's dentalpractice changes. Standardized Terminology and Abbreviations To properly document any dental procedure, to com-municate with colleagues, and to advance dentalscience, practitioners must have a working knowl-edge of dental terminology. An extensive glossaryof terms can be found in many veterinary dentaltextbooks. 2,3Also, to facilitate scientic communi- cation between colleagues, the Nomenclature Com-mittee of the American Veterinary Dental College(AVDC) reviews, claries, and recommends termi- nology for dental and oral anatomical locations, pa-thologies, diagnoses, and treatments. To simplifydental charting, the AVDC recommends a list of AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 49BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CARE NOTESabbreviations for dental nomenclature. The AVDCNomenclature and Abbreviations are available onthe AVDC website. c,d Although various systems for describing and num- bering teeth are recognized, the Modied TriadanTooth Numbering System is the tooth-identicationsystem of choice in veterinary dentistry. 4This sys - tem is applicable to most domestic animal speciesand provides accurate tooth identication in bothwritten and oral communication. Similarly, theduToit Endodontic Numbering System is the systemof choice for the identication of the pulp horns inequine cheek teeth. 5Both of these numbering sys - tems are described in detail in the accompanyinglecture on anatomy. Although each practitioner's dental charts may be personalized to meet his/her specic needs, the au-thor encourages veterinarians to complete their den-tal records using the four standardized systemslisted above to minimize confusion between col-leagues. Veterinarians electing to use nonstan-dardized nomenclature and abbreviations shouldinclude a legend in their dental record. The required legal content of healthcare records, 6 and the process of dental charting have been previ-ously described in other publications 7,8; therefore, the purpose of this presentation is to describe how the use of digital technology can improve the speed,accuracy, and communication of dental records com-pared with written documentation. 2. Materials and Methods Digital Records Advances in and the affordability of handheld,touch-screen, WiFi-enabled, tablet devices and soft-ware applications offer improved recordkeeping ca-pabilities for both the clinic-bound and ambulatoryveterinarian. Tablet note-taking and drawing ap-plications, such as GoodNotes eand Graphicf, are available, which allow the importation and modi- cation of PDF templates. Similarly, several anno-tation applications for Android and PC platformsare available; however, the author has no familiaritywith these applications. Internet le-hosting ser-vices, such as Dropbox.com g, allow for easy access to and sharing of documents from almost any location. The author uses an iPadhtablet and the Good - Notes application for dental recordkeeping. Withthis application, PDF templates are uploaded fromthe clinic server into a Dropbox.com account and arethen imported into the GoodNotes application on theiPad (Fig. 1). Once in GoodNotes, the PDF tem-plate can be duplicated or modied by adding ordeleting pages from other templates using cut/copy/paste commands. Given that the author uses dif-ferent charts for different dental procedures, thistemplate modication feature facilitates creating acase-based dental record for each patient(Fig. 2).Given that GoodNotes a note-taking applica- tion, handwritten modications (notes and illustra-tions) in multiple colors and highlighting are madeon the dental chart template using a stylus. The\"lasso\" tool in GoodNotes allow handwritten notes tobe selected so that they can be moved to anotherpart of the template page, as well as copy/cut andpasted to other pages within the same template oronto another template. This feature facilitates du-plication of repetitive introductory information,such as date, client information, and history, whenservicing multiple patients at one location (Fig. 3).GoodNotes also has textbox and other features, withwhich the author has little experience. Given that most rubber-tipped styluses wear rap- idly, producing sloppy handwriting, the author rec-ommends using a stylus with a replaceable disc tip.This stylus design produces legible writing until thedisc tip is physically broken. The author uses theMusemee Notier Prime Stylus, iwhich allows the tip to be stored within the stylus when not being used (Fig. 4). Once the dental record is completed, it can be stored within the GoodNotes le folder and modiedindenitely. Modied record templates in theGoodNotes le folder can also be copied, perma-nently deleted, or erased (there is an Undo com-mand) for use on another patient. Modied records can also be exported back into Dropbox.com under a unique lename. Once a re-cord is exported from GoodNotes into Dropbox.com,the handwritten modications are permanentlysaved onto the PDF le, and the modications can-not be changed if reimported back into GoodNotes. Although is specically linked to Drop- box.com, other le-hosting services areavailable for offsite le storage/access. Internet re-cord storage is becoming increasingly popularwithin the veterinary profession, and this servicecan be especially time-saving to ambulatory veteri-narians and veterinarians who provide after-hours emergency services. Although some practiceshave committed to permanent Internet storage ofmedical records, this author prefers to use Drop-box.com for temporary storage of the previousyear's records. An introductory Dropbox.com2-GB account is free of charge with available pro-motional space upgrades and reasonable rates forbusiness account storage. Dropbox.com is alsolinked to several email servers and is commonlyused by veterinary professionals. Digital Photography and Oral Endoscopy \"Pictures are worth a thousand words\" and with theadvances in and affordability of handheld cameras,photographic and video supplementation of the writ-ten dental record is a common practice of veterinarydental professionals. It is almost impossible for theconsumer to purchase a camera or phone today thatdoes not feature publication-quality photographicimaging capabilities. Many lesions and oral condi- 50 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREtions are difcult to describe accurately, and dentalphotographs optimize the recording of lesion char-acterization and location, support treatment plan-ning, and improve accounting of treatments. Digitalphotographs and videos also provide a visual plat-form to facilitate communication with colleaguesand clients. Visual oral examination is the standard of care within veterinary dentistry, but due to the long andnarrow anatomic conguration of the equine mouthand the limited spaces dentition, cheeks,and tongue, adequate examination of the caudal oralcavity is difcult to achieve using traditional ex-amination instrumentation. Oral endoscopy sig-nicantly a and equine oral cavity; however, the cost and poorimage quality of the commercially available oro-scopes have relegated the use of this technology toacademic and referral practices. Due to the limita- tions of the commercially available oroscopes, Dr.Frank Schellenberger, in Germany, introduced theconcept of coupling a digital Micro Four Thirds(MFT) camera, which features an interchangeablelens and captures high-quality images and high-denition (HD) video, to a rigid endoscope to createan affordable oroscope suitable for both clinic andambulatory practice. Dr. Robert Pascoe, in Eng-land, further developed this concept by coupling anHD, WiFi-enabled MFT camera to a rigid endoscopeso that the examination could be live streamed to atablet device, using the camera's free app, for im-proved viewing and remote control of the camera.Drs. Ed Earley and Allison Doztel, in Pennsylvania,further expanded this concept by linking the oro-scope system to a video monitor for group viewing inan academic/client education setting.

Results The author has digitalized all paper dental recordsand stored, and transported them on ambulatory calls,on an external hard drive, as well as on the clinicserver for over a decade. The author has used thedigital technologies described in this presentation forover 1.5 years and estimates that his personal daily document management time has been decreased byat least 1 hour. In addition, digital storage andtransfer of clinic documents has signicantly re-duced, but not eliminated, the use of paper withinthe author's dental practice. Digital recordkeepingrequires that the practice implement new policy and training on document handling and storage to pre-vent accidental loss of records during transfer be-tween tablets, Internet le-hosting services, clinicservers, and network stations; however, most em-ployees are eager to use digital technologies andrapidly embrace these policies (Fig. 6). 4. Conclusion Written documentation of professional veterinaryprocedures is required by both legal and ethicalstandards, and the dental chart is the most commonformat for written documentation of dental proce-dures. Dental photography provides the most ac-curate method of supplementing the written dentalrecord, as well as providing a visual platform toimprove communication with colleagues and clients.Advances in touch-screen tablets and software ap- Fig. 2.

The word float is derivedfrom masonry in which a tool or apparatus is used tosmooth or level wet plaster or cement. This termdental float has been applied to the horse whenusing tools to remove enamel points from the cheekteeth 1as well as the process of reduction of teeth with elongations such as hooks, ramps, and beaks.2 Dental prophylaxis is another term that has beenused to describe the reduction of equine teeth toprevent or arrest disease processes. 3 Dental equilibration is a term that has been used to describe procedures that reduce dental crownelongations and treat purported related pathologiessuch as imbalance, asymmetrical occlusal angles, ordisproportionate clinical crown heights. 3The the- ory of equilibrium as applied to engineering statesthat an object subjected to unequal forces will beaccelerated causing movement to a different positionin space. Conversely, if an object is subjected to aset of forces but remains in the same position, thoseforces must be in balance or equilibrium. 4When applying this terminology to orthodontic forces, ithas been shown that the duration of the force ismore important than the magnitude of force. It is the author's experience that this terminology hasmorphed into \"equalizing\" the arcades so they aremade similar to each other or shaped into a precon-ceived idea of a normal tooth height and occlusal angle. All of these terms refer to procedures that remove or reduce tooth structure. The term odontoplastyrefers to the removal of tooth structure or adjust-ment of the tooth contours. 5When performing corrective odontoplasty in the equine patient,orthodontic forces are affected that will change tootheruption, wear, and orientation. It is necessary tohave a fundamental understanding of orthodonticprinciples so that the desired results are accom-plished when corrective odontoplasty is performed.Malocclusions in the horse can be described in fourcategories. Normal occlusion is termed as a Class0. Class I malocclusions involve horses with nor-mal jaw length of the maxilla and mandibles. How-ever, the teeth are either shifted, tipped, rotated,overlong, or short. Classes II, III, and IV are de-scribed in Table 2. Odontoplasty of equine teeth has been performed on horses for \"hundreds of years.\" 1It is a fre- quently performed AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 55BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CARE NOTESdence-based research. A literature search wasperformed for scientic articles on dentalequilibration,\" or \"Equine/Horse odontoplasty,\" anda total of nine articles published in peer reviewedjournals were located by the author. Of these ninearticles; two are randomized controlled clinical stud-ies, 6,7one is a case-controlled clinical study without randomization,8one is a descriptive uncontrolled case study of sedation protocols,9one is a descriptive controlled case series for dental equilibration,10one is a case report,11and three are review articles in - volving expert opinion and case series.12-14Based on the grade of evidence15-17(Table 1 ) with these nine articles: two are Grade I evidence,6,7two are Grade III evidence,8,10and the remaining ve are Grade IV evidence.9,11-14It is interesting to note that the two Grade I evidence studies concluded that dental floating and improved rostral caudalmobility of the mandible did not affect weight gain,feed digestibility, fecal particle size, or body condi-tion score. 6,7In summary, even though dental floating is a procedure that has been performed com- monly in the horse for many decades, there is min-imally published research with very low evidence ofscientic effect for procedures involving odonto-plasty in the equine patient.2. Materials and Methods Bone Physiology, Metabolism, and Biomechanics Bone is very dynamic in terms of physiology and biomechanics. Bone remodeling depends on theinteraction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts.Osteoblasts can originate in the blood, perivascular mesenchymal cells,and precursor cells within the periodontal ligament.Osteoclasts originate from a hematogenic line oflarge monocytes derived from stem cells in the bonemarrow. The cellular activity of osteoblasts andosteoclasts is directly regulated by the interactionbetween receptor activator of nuclear factor kB li-gand on osteoblasts, the receptor activator of nu-clear and the decoy receptor osteoprotegerin. 18,19Wolff's Law4,5describes the net effect based on the dynamics of the cellular activity due to orthodontic forces. It is the principlethat describes the response of biologic hard and softtissues as they become distorted due to externalforces. The forces will affect the form and functionof bone, tooth, and surrounding soft tissue. Thesechanges will lead to changes within the internalarchitecture of the hard and soft tissue. During mastication, orthodontic forces are deliv- ered to the maxilla and mandible. The load on themaxilla is primarily compression and the stress isdistributed evenly throughout the entire cranium.With the expansive lattice network of the nasal tur-binates and sinus structures, the stress is distrib-uted through an architectural lattice so that thestress loads are minimized. As a result, the bone ofthe maxilla is a thinner trabecular (spongy) bone(Fig. 1). The load on the mandible is primarily abending and torsion stress. Unlike the maxilla, themandible must absorb the entire load from the mas-tication force. With adaptation to occlusal forces(Wolff's Law of bone remodeling), the mandibularbone is much stiffer and stronger than the maxilla.The bone of the mandible is composed of thick cor-tices connected by relatively coarse trabeculae. 20 Due to the anatomy and design, the mandible has four types of forces applied to the bone during mas-tication (Fig. 2). The rst two forces are the tensileand compressive forces. The tensile force is pri-marily along the alveolar margin whereas the com-pressive force is along the ventral margin of the Table 2. Classications of OcclusionOrthodontic classication Orthodontic description Class O Normal occlusion relative to the species and breed.Class I Neutroclusion where both the mandible and maxilla are normal length. Teeth are in a normal mesiodistal location. Teeth are displaced in a buccal, lingual or palatal orientation. Rotated or crowed teeth. Class II Distoclusion where either the mandible is short or the maxilla is long.Class III Mesioclusion where either the mandible is long or the maxilla is short.Class IV Mesiodistoclusion is a special classication where one jaw is in mesioclusion and the other is in distoclusion.Table 1.

The other two forces are inward andoutward torsional or twisting forces along the axis ofthe mandibular body. The masticatory musclestend to roll the long axis of the mandible in byinverting the alveolar margin and everting the ven-tral margin. The bite force tends to rotate the longaxis of the mandible in the opposite direction byrolling the mandible out so that the alveolar margintends to evert and the ventral margin is inverted. 20 When excessive torsional or twisting forces of themandible occur, the periosteum will react and createadditional support or bone exostosis in response tothe surface strain. These areas of exostosis arecalled \"Tori\" (Fig. 3). 20The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the princi- ple adaptive center for determining the proper rela-tionship in all three planes of space (transverse,occlusal, and anterior-posterior) for the maxilla andmandibles. 20,21When jaw structure and function is altered, the TMJ has the ability to adapt, relocate, and even regenerate so that functional masticationis maintained. In humans, following a unilateralsubcondylar fracture and a medially displaced con-dyle head (due to forces from the superior pterygoidmuscle), the displaced condyle head will resorb.A new condyle will form and replace the originalcondyle with full normal function and no signicantdeviation of the mandible. 20In domestic small an - imals (dogs and cats), it has been shown that ifrestriction to mobility of the TMJ occurs throughankylosis; 90% of the time it is dueto of the TMJ. The equine orthodontic force applied during masti-cation has been measured at 248 newtons (55 lb/force) in the closing stroke and 875 newtons (196lb/force) in the power stroke with the rst cheekteeth (306/406). A force as high as 1925 newtons(432 lb/force) has been calculated for the powerstroke with the last cheek teeth (311/411). 23,24 Forces for physiological tooth movement typicallyonly require 0.04-0.06 lb/cm 2of pressure or less. The force should be less than capillary blood pres- sure so that bone necrosis does not occur.5Pres - sure is the amount of force applied over a givensurface area.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 TO CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREapproximately 6.25 cm2, the calculated pressure values would be 8.8 lb/cm2for the closing stroke of the rst cheek tooth, 31.36 lb/cm2for the power stroke of the rst cheek tooth, and 69 lb/cm2for the power stroke of the last cheek tooth. Orth- odontic pressures in the equine patient range be-tween 25- and 197-fold above the requiredpressure for tooth movement. This extreme dif-ference between orthodontic pressure and physio-logic pressure demonstrates how a minor changewith odontoplasty can have a tremendous influ-ence on tooth movement. There are six types of tooth movement that can occur. The types of movement are listed belowfrom the easiest to the most difcult: 5,24,25 1. Extrusion is movement of the tooth out of the alveolus. It is best to use light forces toreduce the chance of accidental avulsion. 2. Tipping is the most common orthodontic movement, in which the crown is affectedprimarily. The true center of rotation is lo-cated at the junction of the middle and apicalthirds of the tooth. The root/apical third ofthe reserve crown will slightly move in theopposite direction of the crown. Light con-tinuous force is best for tipping movement. 3. Radicular (root) movement is referred to as root tipping, in which the fulcrum is betweenthe coronal and middle third of theroot. The coronal edge is held stationarywhile force is applied to the neck of the tooth. 4. Rotation refers to rotation around the long axis of the tooth. All periodontal ligamentbers are stretched in the same spiral direc-tion. Recoil is a major problem. Light in-termittently applied forces are best. 5. Translation is the bodily movement of the entire tooth by using an appliance that isxed to the crown. Movement is bestachieved with light forces initially followedby moderate forces. 6. Intrusion is movement of the tooth into the alveolus. Force is applied in the same di-rection as occlusal forces (the periodontalligament is designed to resist this move-ment). It is best to use light forces to re-duce the chance of apical resorption andpulp necrosis secondary to compression ofapical vessels. 3. Results and Discussion: Class I Malocclusions Skull Asymmetry Skull asymmetry will predispose the equine patientto occlusal abnormalities. Typically, these areClass I malocclusions that involve the incisors, pre-molars, and molars, and may develop into Class IVmalocclusions (Table 2). 5Skull asymmetry com - monly involves the maxilla and incisive bone. Asmastication occurs with an asymmetrical skull, theforces applied to the premolars and molars of the maxillae and mandible become disproportionate.As a result, tipping of these teeth may occur to allowfor equal forces to be applied between the maxillaand mandible. As the cheek teeth shift/tip, the oc-clusal angles of the right and left arcades willchange to accommodate functional mastication.As a result of the shift with the occlusal forces on thecheek teeth, the incisor teeth develop an offsetasymmetrical wear pattern or incisor diagonalwhere there is excessive attrition of the mandibularincisors in the direction of the maxilla deviation.Maxillary incisors will have increased attritionopposite the direction of the maxilla deviation.Conversely, inadequate attrition occurs with theover long maxillary incisors that are in the samedirection as the maxilla overlongmandibular incisors are opposite maxilla devi- ation. 14,25A 204 incisor malocclusions inhorses. 26The results of the study described skull asymmetry by noting a decrease in molar (and pre- molar) excursion on the side opposite the elongatedmaxillary incisor(s). Corrective odontoplasty pro-cedures (not clearly described in the materials andmethods) did not signicantly improve the cheekteeth excursion along the opposite side of the max-illary incisor(s) elongation. 26 Corrective odontoplasty should focus on the pre- molars and molars so that the occlusion will allowfor functional mastication. Excessive odontoplastyis not indicated. Care should be instituted to try tomaintain the occlusal angles that the masticatoryforces have created. Equalizing or balancing theocclusal angles will make it more difcult for theasymmetric patient to masticate. Once a func-tional occlusion has been established with the cheekteeth, the occlusion of the incisors can be evaluated.If the over-long incisors (inadequate attrition) com-promise the occlusion of the cheek minimalodontoplasty may be Maleruption The equine radicular teeth that contin-ually erupt. As a consequence, a maleruptinghypsodont tooth has the potential to create moredental pathology than a brachyodont tooth. In theequine patient a continual maleruption may lead toperiodontal and/or endodontic pathology. Malerup-tions can be developmental or genetic. Developmental maleruptions may occur when there is a change in masticatory forces due to miss-ing or overlong teeth. Typically, the orthodonticmovement with a developmental maleruption is tip-ping. Careful evaluation of the occlusion is indi-cated with the oral examination when determiningthe cause of a developmental maleruption. In ad-dition, radiographic evaluation may be necessary toevaluate the periodontic and endodontic status ofthe tooth. Once the abnormal occlusal loads have 58 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF DENTAL CAREbeen identied and isolated, specic focal areas ofodontoplasty should be applied to change or removethe forces on the tooth. Genetic maleruptions may occur due to decrease in length of the maxilla/mandible or crowdingfrom supernumerary teeth. A common orthodon-tic movement with genetic maleruption is rotation.These teeth should be evaluated radiographicallyand may need treatment other than odontoplasty(such as periodontal, endodontic, or extraction). 27 Tooth ElongationTooth elongation refers to a tooth that is taller thanthe neighboring teeth in the same or contralateralarcade. When performing an oral examination,careful evaluation is indicated to discern whetherthe tooth is elongated or if there is excessive attri-tion with the adjoining teeth. An evaluation of theopposing tooth in occlusion should be performed.Commonly, the tooth opposite the elongated tooth iswhere the pathology exists, whereas the elongatedtooth is a normal tooth that has not been allowed towear through normal masticatory forces of occlu-sion. As a result of a decrease in occlusal force withthe elongated tooth, there may be less secondarydentin 28,29created above the pulp horns. With ex - cessive odontoplasty this could create pulp expo-sure(s) and lead to pulpal inflammation andendodontic disease. Elongated teeth have an aver-age depth of secondary occlusal dentin (SOD) of 10mm. However, the range is between 2.5 and 17 mmof SOD. As a result of the wide range of SOD, if anelongated tooth is reduced to the occlusal level of theneighboring teeth, there is a 58% chance of pulpexposure occurring in the elongated tooth. 28The conclusion of Marshall et al was that tooth elonga- tions should be treated \"by a few millimeters at atime, over a prolonged period.\" From an orthodon-tic force perspective, typically, only 1-3 mm of toothremoval is needed to change the forces of mastica- tion and decrease the occlusal force directly over theopposing tooth (Fig. 4). Pathological Wave Pattern? In human orthodontics an example of a wave pat-tern does exist. Dental equilibrium would be whentwo opposing teeth are in occlusion, a balanced forceexisting so that the tooth height and alveolar marginare of similar height. If one of the opposing teeth inocclusion has excessive attrition or is missing, theopposite tooth will erupt into the space created.The alveolar margin bone 30(Margo alveolaris) of the missing tooth will resorb while new alveolar bone forms around the erupting tooth for support. Withthe remodeling of the alveolar margins, the orth-odontic forces are once again in equilibrium. 4This scenario demonstrates that a wave pattern will co- exist with dental equilibrium (Fig. 5). Equalizingor leveling the arcades is not necessary for dentalequilibrium to occur. In the equine patient, a wave pattern is a common nding that commonly involves the molars. Themandibular rst and second molars tend to have ahigher rate of attrition, whereas the maxillary rstand second molars tend to be slightly elongated.In the author's practice, a moderate wave is presentapproximately 42% of the time. The wave patternmay be explained by Wolff's Law, as described pre-viously. Supraeruption is a general term describ-ing eruption of the crown beyond its occlusal plane.Supraeruption can be due to active eruption or peri-odontal growth. Periodontal growth is a type ofsegmental alveolar bone growth in which the peri- Fig. 4. Elongated tooth (409). Fig. 5. Wave development in human dentistry with equilibrium. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 59BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREodontal tissues (including alveolar bone and gingiva)develop in a coronal direction. 31If periodontal growth occurs; examination of the gingival margin relative to the occlusal surface should be evaluatedprior to implementing corrective odontoplasty so asto prevent excessive crown reduction. In normal horses it has been shown that the oc- clusal angles of the caudal steepen in a caudal direction. The maxillarypremolars and molars tend to average the sameangle of occlusion (range, 12.5-18\u00b0). 32Studies have suggested that the common condition of enamel points may be a normal condition.33,34When evaluating a wave pattern, careful examination should be given to the vertical curvature of the caudal mandible alongthe alveolar margin and the height of the clinicalcrown relative to the gingival margin. A curvatureof the arcade may be normal due to the curvature ofthe caudal alveolar margin of the occlusal curve). Horses age 3-10years have a signicant difference in the height ofthe curve of spee compared with horses greaterthan 11 years of age. 35Masticatory force is sig - nicantly affected by the occlusal curve and thetooth location. Both a larger occlusal curve andteeth located more caudal result in increased mas-ticatory force. 23,35If inappropriate or excessive crown reduction is performed on a caudal molar in a young horse, the functional mastication could beseverely jeopardized. The mandibular fourth premolar may have an appearance of being elongated due to attrition of therst and second mandibular molars. Careful andcritical evaluation of the crown to gingiva heightshould be made to determine whether the crownheight is truly elongated (Fig. 6). If the wave issevere and the fourth premolar is accurately diag-nosed as elongated, then a slight (1-3 mm) and focalodontoplasty may be indicated. The removal of ex-cessive tooth structure or drastic change in the oc-clusal angles could create excessive loss of occlusionand alter the normal masticatory forces.Missing Dentition Extractions, injuries, broken teeth, dental agenesis,etc. will lead to a missing tooth or teeth. Missingdentition may occur in the incisor arch and thecheek teeth arcade. Orthodontic forces are differ-ent when comparing the incisors to the cheek teeth. The primary orthodontic force with missing den- tition in the incisor arch is tipping. This tippingaction may predispose the tipped incisor to abnor-mal premature wear along the distal or mesial as-pect of the reserve crown, depending upon thedirection of tipping. Minor odontoplasty of the op-posing incisor(s) may be indicated to prevent abnor-mal attrition of the tipped incisors. A sequence of orthodontic forces occurs with miss- ing dentition in the middle of the cheek teeth arcade.Tipping is usually the rst movement, followed byradicular movement. The nal net effect of theorthodontic movement is translation. A cheekteeth arcade tends to act as a single large toothwith the mastication forces. Following the net translation movement, the cheek teeth arcade isshorter than the opposing arcade. The initial tipping movement will require light odontoplasty of the op- posing tooth that would normally occlude with themissing tooth.

Excessive Cingula, Enamel Point, and Transverse Ridge? The maxillary cheek teeth have prominent verticalridges (cingula or styles) along the buccal aspect. 3 The mandibular cheek teeth also have ridges butthey are not as prominent as in the maxillary cheekteeth. With the layering of the cementum, enamel,and dentin, these cingula give strength and supportto the cheek teeth so that they are able to withstandthe forces of mastication. Enamel points tend todevelop along the occlusal extent of the styles (Fig.5). Transverse ridges are linear cusps that runalong the occlusal surface in a buccal to palatal/lingual direction (Fig. 6). The transverse ridges al-low for an increased occlusal surface area formastication. The combination of the enamel point,cingula, and transverse ridge allows for an enhancedtearing and shearing function with roughage/forageand an improved mastication process. Aggressiveenamel point, cingula, and transverse odonto-plasty will weaken the dentition and reduce func-tional mastication (Fig. 7). 4. Conclusion Masticatory pressures in the equine patient are 25-197-fold greater than orthodontic pressures re-quired for tooth movement. Duration of pressure iseven more important than the magnitude of pres-sure when dealing with equilibrating orthodonticforces and tooth movement. With the increasedpressures and almost constant mastication of theequine patient, orthodontic forces are continually ineffect compared with other species. As a result,minor changes with odontoplasty will still have atremendous orthodontic effect, whereas excessiveodontoplasty could be devastating. An orthodonticexamination should entail an accurate evaluation ofhow masticatory forces are effecting a Class I mal-occlusion. Occlusal forces can be reduced or elimi-nated with minimal focal odontoplasty of theinvolved teeth. A diagnosis should be made on a\"tooth-by-tooth\" basis so that a treatment plan ofprecise focal odontoplasty can be developed andimplemented.

Introduction Many practitioners struggle to obtain radiographs ofthe horse's teeth that are of diagnostic quality.The most common factors responsible for poor qual-ity dental radiographs are below: Patient movement Improper positioning of \"standard\" views Poor radiographic technique (combination of kVp and mAs) Outdated or malfunctioning radiographic equipment or imaging software 2. Materials and Methods Obtaining diagnostic dental radiographs of thehorse requires adequate sedation. This oftenmeans sedation more profound than is required fororal examination or performing minor dental proce-dures, such as floating sharp enamel points on cheekteeth. As an example that many practitioners arefamiliar with, this would be similar to the level ofalpha-2 adrenergic sedation used prior to ketamineanesthetic induction. With this level of sedation,the horse will be unresponsive to placement of theradiographic sensor next to the head and will restthe chin on a low support, such as a step stool.If using a direct radiography (DR) system, restingthe sensor on the same stool will usually eliminatemotion artifact (Fig. 1). If using computed radiog- raphy (CR) systems, the cassette can be secured tothe head with elastic straps (bungie cords); with thisarrangement, even if the horse's head moves therewill not be blurring of the image. For the intraoralviews of the incisors and canine teeth, it will oftenhelp ug/kg, IV).With in a low position, it is also mucheasier to properly position the central beam for thedorsoventral (DV) and lateral views of the head. It is very helpful to strive for standard views of the horse's teeth. This greatly improves the diagnosticquality of the images and permits more productiveconsultation with radiologists and equine veterinarydental specialists. Be as fussy with your dental ra-diographs as you are with your pre-purchase radio-graphs of the extremities. One of the greatadvantages of digital radiography is the ability to takeadditional views when the image is unsatisfactory.With practice, the number of \"retakes\" will becomefewer. Some positioning tips that may be helpful arebelow: Obtain the intraoral views rst, when sedation is most profound. This will improve your chancesof the horse not chewing when the imaging plate/sensor is placed within the mouth (Fig. 2). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 63BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CARE NOTESProceed to the DV views next. With the horse's head in a low position, with the chinresting on a stool, it is possible to hold thegenerator and look directly over it to line upthe central beam perpendicular to the dorsalplane, which is parallel to the plane of the hardpalate (Fig. 3). There are multiple methods ofobtaining right and left offset-mandible DVviews (Fig. 4), and these are likewise best to obtain during this initial period ofmore profound sedation. Survey DV views ofthe cheek teeth should be obtained with thecentral beam perpendicular to the long axis ofthe head (the dorsal plane, which is parallel tothe hard palate). However, given that therostral and caudal cheek teeth are not at a 90\u00b0 Fig. 1. Using a DR system (left), the patient's head and the DR sensor are supported by the stool. The assistant holding the sensor must position him/herself out of the primary beam and wear protective gloves, apron, and thyroid shield. The technician holding the generatorshould also try to wear protective gloves if possible. With a CR system (right) the plate can be attached to the patient's head with elasticcords. In the image on the left, the horse's mouth is opened with a Stubbs speculum, while on the right a 2-inch piece of PVC pipe is used. Fig. 2. Intraoral views of the maxillary incisors and mandibular incisors and canine teeth. The bisecting angle technique is used toprevent foreshortening or elongation of the incisors. For the maxillary incisors this is a rostrodorsal-caudoventral oblique in whichthe central beam is approximately 60\u00b0 to the dorsal plane, which is parallel to the sensor (R60D-CdVO). For the mandibular incisors,the view is R60V-CdDO. In geriatric horses, the angulation of the incisors might require changing the x-ray beam to /H1135070\u00b0. Adding right and left obliquity to the central beam helps isolate the apices of the 3rd incisors. Note that the mandibular canine teeth cangenerally be imaged with the intraoral view, whereas the maxillary canines are too caudal in the mouth to image.64 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREFig. 3. Positioning for the DV view. Line up the central beam perpendicular to the dorsal plane (which is nearly parallel to thepalate and the sensor) by looking directly over the x-ray generator. Fig. 4. Positioning for the DV with offset mandibles. One assistant is using gauze bandage material to pull the maxilla to the horse'sleft, whereas the other pulls the mandibles to the right. A commercially available device (right) designed to offset the mandibles. Fig. 5. Straight DV view (left) and the DV with the mandibles offset to the horse's left (right). Note that the central beam is aligneddown the long axis of the right maxillary 3rd premolar (107) in the image on the left, with poor detail of the maxillary molars.In the image on the right, the central beam is directly down the long axis of the right maxillary 3rd and 4th cheek teeth (108, 109),with poor detail of the 2nd premolar (106) and the 3rd molar (111). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 65BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREangle to this plane, their images will be slightly blurred (Fig. 5). Slight rostro-caudalor caudo-rostral adjustment of the centralbeam will be necessary to obtain a good long-axis image of these teeth. The straight lateral (laterolateral) view is ob- tained with the central beam centered on theocclusal aspect of the cheek teeth, at the levelof the rostral end of the facial crest. The right-left marker should indicate the side ofthe head that is closest to the imaging plate/sensor. The technique should be chosen thatgives good detail of the paradental alveolarbone and sinus anatomy (Fig. 6). The oblique lateral views should be obtained with the mouth held wide open with a biteblock or dental speculum. Using the Ameri-can College of are the Lt30D-RtVO, Rt30D-LtVO, Lt45V-RtDO, and Rt45V-LtDO views. It is important to have the mouth wide Fig. 6. The right lateral view. The sensor is on the right side ofthe horse's head, so the right (R) marker is used to identify thedirectionality. The technique used maximizes the detail of thesinus anatomy. Fig. 7.

The apices of the right maxillary cheek teeth are isolated in this view. This view alsoisolates the crowns of the right mandibular cheek teeth.66 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREopen for these views. As with the straight lateral, with these orthogonal views the cen-tral beam is directed perpendicular to the longaxis of the head. When the long axis of thehead is parallel or perpendicular to the ground, it is easy to align the centralbeam. However, the head is usually at anangle to the vertical or horizontal, so care mustbe taken to keep the central beam perpendic-ular to the long axis of the head for theselateral oblique views. For example, it is easyto obtain caudorostral obliquity when position-ing for the ventrodorsal (VD) obliqueview of the mandibular cheek teeth. Although the mandibular canine teeth are usually imaged with the intraoral views of themandibular incisors, In this case,use with the central beam 5-10\u00b0 caudal tothe frontal plane (e.g., the central beam isangled slightly in a caudal-to-rostral direc-tion). This will project the and caudalto the contralateral maxillary canine, which iscloser to the generator (Fig. 7). 3. Discussion The Lt30D-RtVO view will isolate the apices of theright maxillary cheek teeth; with the mouth wideopen, this view will also isolate the coronal aspect ofthe right mandibular cheek teeth (Fig. 8). TheRt45V-LtDO radiograph, if carefully positioned, willisolate the apices of the left maxillary cheek teeth in the space between the mandibular cheek teeth and thecrowns of the right maxillary cheek teeth. If theplate/sensor is large enough, this positioning willalso image the apices and reserve crowns of the leftmandibular cheek teeth (Fig. 9). This open-mouthVD lateral oblique view will usually project the pal-atal roots of the maxillary cheek teeth, whereas theDV lateral oblique view projects the buccal roots ofthe maxillary cheek teeth. These two views arecomplementary and should be considered togetherin the evaluation of the apices and reserve crowns ofthe maxillary cheek teeth. Fig. 9. The Rt45V-LtDO open mouth view. The central beamneeds to be approximately perpendicular to the long axis of thehead. Start as if taking a straight lateral view then lower thegenerator 45-50\u00b0 while keeping the central beam perpendicularto the long axis of the head. A common mistake is to move thegenerator caudally as it is lowered to the 45\u00b0 results incaudal-rostral obliquity. With a large-enough plate/sensor, theapices of the left maxillary cheek teeth and the left mandibularcheek teeth are isolated in this view. Fig. 10. Alternative positioning for imaging the left mandibular 3rd molar (311). The central beam is directed from dorsal to ventraland from CHANGING FACE OF EQUINE DENTAL CAREAs a starting point, use the technique for 3rd phalanx imaging for the intraoral views of the inci-sors, the fetlock technique for the lateral extraoralviews, and the stifle technique for the DV views ofthe skull. For the Cuatro Slate DR system used inthis publication, the generator was 20mA, the focal-lm (sensor) distance was 26 inches, and the kvp/mAs used is below: Incisors (and canine teeth): 60 kVp/1.6 mAs Cheek teeth, lateral views: 75 kVp, 2.5 mAs Caudal mandibular cheek teeth, lateral may require 80 kVp/3.2 mAs DV views: 90-100 kVp/3.6-4.5 mAs Note that the straight lateral view will often haveunderexposure of the cheek teeth to obtain the cor-rect exposure of the sinus anatomy. Commonly,the manufacturer's suggested technique for skullradiographs results 10% will likely remedy this. Themandibular 3rd molars are also often challenging toimage, primarily due to the thickness of the overly-ing masseter muscle. The clinician can try usingthe maximum kVp setting and doubling the mAs.Alternatively, the mandibular 3rd molar can be im-aged with an open-mouth DV and slightly caudal-rostral projection (Figs. 10 and 11). Some systems,notably the portable equine CR systems, may nothave software algorithms that provide ideal imagingof the cheek teeth and sinuses. If changing thetechnique as described above does not improve yourimage, then it is likely that the algorithms requireadjustment by the technical support service pro-vided by that particular software company. If theradiology system cannot image the stifle, then it willsimilarly be unable to image the mandibular molars. If the imaging software seems to be preventing proper contrast and detail of the area of interest, itmay prove helpful to collimate the generator so that a smaller portion of the imaging plate/sensor is ex-posed, and the center of the plate/sensor is thencentered on the area of interest (e.g. the caudalmandible, or maxillary sinuses). With some practice, the clinician should be able to obtain diagnostic quality radiographs with most ofthe portable radiographic systems currently in use. 4. Summary Although the equine head has a complex anatomy,the teeth and sinus anatomy can be imaged quitewell with portable digital radiographic systems thatmost equine practitioners have in clinical practice.The prerequisites for obtaining diagnostic images ofthe equine dentition are adequate sedation, properpositioning, and technique. the\"standard views\" in an equine dental imaging studywill assist the clinician in obtaining images that areof diagnostic quality for immediate use in the eld,or for consultation. Clinicians are encouraged toobtain both right and left lateral oblique views forcomparative purposes. The oblique lateral viewsare most informative if they are obtained with themouth wide open.

Caldwell, DVM Author's address: Silverton Equine lac4492@aol.com. \u00a9 2016 AAEP. 1. Introduction The dentition of the horse, also known asthe deciduous dentition, is frequently encounteredby the equine practitioner either during routine pro-cedures or as a primary complaint, and is a never-ending source of discussion. Questions regardingthe rst premolars, also known as \"wolf teeth,\" willstill elicit strong opinions regarding their extraction.In the past decade, little has changed about the waywe approach the canines, but our knowledge of theunique nature of radicular hypsodont dentition inthe horse, Modied Triadan system designates decid-uous, or primary dentition, as the 500 through 800teeth, with the 500 arcade indicating the upper rightquadrant, 600 is upper left, 700 is lower left, and 800is lower right. The central incisors are tooth num-ber 001 and the teeth are numbered distally (to-wards the back of the mouth) to the third and lastmolar which is designated tooth number 011. Forexample, the deciduous right maxillary central inci-sor is number 501 and maxillary fourth premolar is tooth number 508.The molars are always permanent teeth, so thisdiscussion will focus on teeth number 001-008.The use of the Modied Triadan system signicantlyreduces confusion. \"Caps\" is the colloquial term for deciduous teeth just prior to shedding or \"exfoliation\" because of thethin, rootless structure they become. Deciduousteeth are present for up to 5 years in the horse, andthey may be present longer in the donkey anddraft breeds. 1Primary central incisors and second, third, and fourth premolars are present in foals atbirth or shortly thereafter. The central incisors areTriadan tooth number one and the fourth premolarsare Triadan tooth number eight. The eruptionschedule is depicted using Modied Triadan Sys-tem in Table 1. The deciduous incisors are small and round with an obvious \"neck\" at the intersection of the crownand root at the gingival margin. Deciduous inci-sors are very white and shiny because there is nocementum on their labial surface, leaving the pe- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 69BACK TO BASICS: THE CHANGING OF DENTAL CARE NOTESripheral enamel exposed. The becomes \"level\" or \"in wear\" approxi-mately 6 months after eruption and has exposedsecondary dentin inside the outer ring of enamel.An enamel infundibulum isvisible on the occlusal to the permanent The decid-uous radicular hypsodont crowns undergo wear or\"suffer attrition\" while the permanent teeth are de-veloping within the bone. Permanent (secondary or succedaneous) teeth de- velop in a dental follicle or sac just underneath theroot of the primary tooth. The permanent incisorsdevelop lingually/palatally to the deciduous incisors.The contains the enamel organ andprimitive dentin and pulp. Within the dental folli-cle of the incisors and maxillary premolars, a bloodvessel enters the developing permanent tooth fromits crown to form the infundibula. 2Infection or loss of the primary tooth may damage the developing secondary tooth because of the intimate proximity ofthe two structures. For this reason, it is importantto know the exfoliation schedule of the deciduousteeth and the eruption schedule of the permanentdentition. As the developing permanent tooth moves through the \"eruption tunnel\" underneath the decid-uous tooth, pressure develops upon the root of theprimary precursor. This pressure, among otherfactors, causes the deciduous tooth to undergo rootresorption and to move further orally. As the de-ciduous tooth root resorbs and suffers simultaneousattrition of its crown, the permanent tooth continuesto move orally and cause resorption of the bone.As the succedaneous tooth reaches the level of thegingiva, the dental follicle and oral epithelium fuseto form the gingival attachments. The deciduousincisor becomes a loose, rootless structure or \"cap\"labial to the erupting permanent incisor. The de-ciduous premolar also becomes a thin \"cap\" justprior to exfoliation. 3 Eruption and exfoliation tends to occur in pairs. The mandibular caps tend to exfoliate shortly beforethe maxillary caps exfoliate, although this is highlyvariable. Masticatory forces, abrasive forces of feedmaterial, or movement of the lips and tongue aid in the shedding of the caps. Exfoliation should resultin both members of an analogous pair being shed atapproximately the same time. If this is not thecase, the cap is considered to be \"retained\" or \"per-sistent.\" The exfoliation schedule for horses is asfollows in Table 2. The decision to extract a cap is centered around the exfoliation schedule and the clinical condition ofthe tooth. The succedaneous (permanent) toothshould be visible above the gingiva and the capshould be mobile when touched with ngers or for-ceps (Fig. 1). Premature removal of deciduous teeth can be an invasive surgical procedure and may damage theunderlying developing secondary tooth. Rupture ofthe immature dental follicle of the permanent toothwill stop development of the enamel, prevent properformation of the gingival attachment, and may re-sult in loss of that tooth completely. Extraction of persistent deciduous teeth is gener- ally neither difcult nor painful for the horse. Theexception would be if the tooth is broken or retainedwith incomplete resorption of the root. A deciduoustooth is considered retained or persistent when itscounterpart in the adjacent arcade has already suc-cessfully exfoliated (Fig. 2, A and B). The deciduous incisors, when retained, tend to have long roots that have been resorbed lingually orTable 1.

Extraction will requireanesthesia of the gingival attachments to avoidcausing discomfort upon incision and elevation ofthe gingiva from the retained tooth. If a persistentdeciduous incisor is left in place for too long, thepermanent incisor may be forced lingually or pala-tally. After the persistent deciduous incisor is re-moved, the permanent tooth will move into line withthe rest of the incisors fairly quickly. The premo-lars, when retained, tend to have root spicules pal-atally, or are fractured and only a piece is retained,which can then retard the post-eruptive phase of thepermanent tooth and may lead to formation ofmalocclusions. Prior to extraction of any cap, it is necessary to elevate the gingival attachments, if any. By judi-ciously cutting any remaining attachment to thegingiva, avulsion of gingiva or mucosa can beavoided and loss of blood kept to a minimum. Cut-ting the gingival attachment can be facilitated bythe use of aor A small periosteal elevator4is useful to cut the attachment of any junctional epitheliumthat remains on a deciduous incisor. A pair of leftand right Cryer elevators 5works cut the junctional epithelium of the deciduous premolars. Luxation (sharp cutting of the periodontal attach-ment) should not be necessary in the case of mostdeciduous caps that are ready to be removed (Figs. 3and 4). When all gingival attachments have been cut, for- ceps may be applied to remove the tooth from themouth. The persistent deciduous incisors shouldjust lift out. Premolar caps be then checked for root spicule fragments inthe gingiva of the palate. Root fragments left in thepalate can be a source of irritation or periodontaldisease. Mild periodontal disease is a frequentnding with normal deciduous caps that have be-come so thin and loose as to allow feed material tobecome entrapped underneath the cap. Development of the secondary dentition in the horse may cause visible eruption cysts of the headand are normal in three and four year olds. The boney swellings should be symmetrical and non-painful. These eruption cysts are commonly visibleon the ventral border of the mandible and corre-spond to the development of the third and fourthpremolars (Fig. 5 and 6). Not infrequently, the development of the maxil- lary fourth premolars will result in a swollen andboxy appearance to the face, especially in miniaturehorses. These swellings should resolve within afew weeks after the deciduous tooth has shed andthe permanent tooth has reached its position withinthe arcade. Asymmetrical swelling of the eruptioncysts with associated inflammation and pain maysuggest a problem with eruption and exfoliation. A commonly encountered problem with eruption and exfoliation in horses occurs with the fourth pre- Fig. 2. A and B, Retained or persistent deciduous tooth 601. Fig. 3.

The reason for this is that the fourth pre-molar (No. 08 tooth) is the last deciduous cheektooth to erupt and shed. This tooth must form aneruption tunnel between the rst molar (No. 09tooth), which erupts into the mouth at 1 year of age,and the third premolar (No. 07 tooth), which eruptsapproximately 1 year before the fourth premolar(No. 08). The fourth premolar must form an erup-tion tunnel in the middle of an arcade of teeth heldtightly together by the interdental ligament and theangulation of the rst and last cheek teeth. Theinterdental or transseptal ligament is the structurethat runs along the alveolar process and connectsthe crowns of the teeth together to form the tightinterproximal relationships that prevent food frombecoming entrapped between the teeth. 6This tight space afforded to the fourth premolar leads to the aforementioned eruption and exfoliation problems. Impaction of the fourth premolars will cause pain- ful, inflamed, potentially infected dental folli-cles. Inflamed maxillary eruption cysts mayinterfere with the normal function of the nasolacri-mal duct, resulting in the development of persistentocular discharge. Inflamed mandibular eruptioncysts may form a stulous tract through the mandi-ble and discharge either subcutaneously or cutane-ously. The veterinarian should understand why it is not wise to remove the deciduous fourth premolarcap in this situation. By removing the cap, theinterdental ligament pulls the adjacent teeth to-gether even tighter, exacerbating the pinching effectand encouraging impaction of the erupting tooth.Therefore, it is recommended to leave the No. 08 capin place as long as possible until the permanentfourth premolar has moved well above the alveolarprocess and into the correct position in the arcade. The permanent fourth premolar (No. 08) will fre- quently erupt either palatally, lingually, or buccallywhen the eruption tunnel does not afford enoughroom for completion of eruption. The developingtooth may also rotate along its vertical axis to ac-complish eruption. The premolars are longer me-sial to distal than they are wide, so the uneruptedpermanent tooth may rotate 90 degrees, usuallysuch that the buccal side occupies the mesial posi-tion. This will result in periodontal disease lateron because the enamel columns in the interproximalspace trap feed material. It may not be possible toprevent rotation of the tooth, or lingual, palatal, or buccal but these maleruptions arepreferable to impaction. Radiographs are neces-sary for complete evaluation in the case of eruptionand exfoliation problems. Removal of deciduous caps is most appropriate if they are ready to shed during routine dental proce-dures or if there is a clinical problem that is discov-ered during a complete oral and dental healthexamination. Poorly timed exfoliation while beingridden has reportedly caused violent, explosive epi-sodes in surprised young horses, so a comprehensiveoral health assessment is indicated for all horsesprior to the commencement of training in the bridle,and frequently during the eruptive and exfoliativeyears (up to 5-6 years of age). Caps should only beremoved when they are ready to exfoliate or if thereis no other option because their presence may en-danger the developing permanent tooth. Thefourth premolar caps should be left in situ for as longas possible, especially in the case of partial or com-plete impaction. Judicious odontoplasty of the deciduous teeth can be performed to remove sharp enamel points, butodontoplasty of the deciduous incisors is rarely nec-essary. Doing so, especially during the eruptiveand exfoliative phase of the young horse, can placetoo much occlusal pressure upon the newly eruptedpermanent teeth if the deciduous incisors arebrought down to level the arcade. The newlyerupted incisors are not strong enough to withstandocclusal forces. The adjacent deciduous incisorswill continue to function in occlusion while theerupting incisors are reaching the occlusal level ofthe arcade and developing additional strength byadding secondary dentin to the structure of thetooth.

The First Premolars or Wolf Teeth First premolars of the horse are vestigial and areknown colloquially as \"wolf teeth.\" They are No. 05in the Modied Triadan system. There may be zeroor up to four wolf teeth in a horse, but most horseshave only two maxillary rst premolar teetherupted. Because digital radiography in equinedental practice is more commonly employed at thetime of this writing, more unerupted wolf teeth areidentied. The wolf teeth erupt between 6 and 12months of age and are generally present just mesialto the second premolars (Modied Triadan No. 06,also known as the rst cheek teeth). The locationcan be in tight interproximal relation to the secondpremolar, palatal, buccal, or anywhere within thebars of the horse's mouth. The farther the wolftooth is located mesially from the second premolar,the more likely it will be unerupted or \"blind.\" Theshape of the wolf tooth can vary from spiculated toconical to molarized, meaning that it may displaycusps and a complex pulp system. It may or maynot be associated with an alveolus (Fig. 7). The wolf tooth may or may not be shed when the second premolar cap sheds, depending upon howclose it lays to the No. 06 tooth. Many wolf teethbecome loose as the No. 06 tooth erupts and maycause discomfort when a horse is bridled. The con-troversy as to whether one should extract the wolfteeth continues to this day, and it may just be saidthat it is a matter of the owner and the veterinari-an's decision. The extraction procedure should always be per- formed with local anesthesia and with care as to theproximity of the palatine artery. Local anesthesiais accomplished by infusing with orwithout epinephrine, just underneath the mucosapalatally and buccally to the tooth. The palatineartery lies just palatal to the maxillary cheek teethand can easily be lacerated by dental instruments,resulting in an impressive loss of blood. Many lux-ators (instruments that sharply cut tissue) and ele-vators (instruments that tear tissue with atorqueing motion) are available for wolf tooth re-moval. An assortment of luxators that can accom-modate various sized wolf teeth is recommended,along with an orthopedic mallet. The use of theorthopedic mallet provides a controlled force for cut- ting any periodontal attachments, greatly reducingthe risk of slippage into the mucosa of the palate orlaceration of the palatine artery. It is the author'spreference to avoid the Burgess-type extraction in-struments, given that they tend to core out the toothand surrounding gingiva, causing excessive bleed-ing, and one can easily break the tooth off in thelumen of the Burgess instrument. With time andexperience, each individual operator will nd theinstruments that work best in their hands. 4. The Canine Teeth The canine teeth are No. 04 in the Modied Triadansystem. Horses have zero to four canines, with fourpermanent being the usual precede thepermanent canines resorb during eruption ofthe permanent canine. The permanent canineerupts between 4 and 6 years of age and reaches itsfull length of 5-7 cm a few years later. Sharp andspade shaped with a convex bump on the lingual/palatal surface, the canine teeth are specialized inmale equidae for ghting. Females typically do nothave permanent canine teeth, but may have persis-tent unerupted deciduous or only barely eruptedpermanent canines that remain throughout theirlives. It has been frequently spoken and written inthe recent past that the canine teeth \"are the onlybrachydont teeth in the horse.\" This statement is notconsistent with the facts. Horses have radicularhypsodont dentition and are not a brachydont spe-cies. All the teeth in the horse are of the radicularhypsodont type and behave as such, including thecanines. Although the canine teeth are completelyenveloped in enamel with a smattering of externalcementum, there is no cemento-enamel junction ofthe crown and root in the equine is typical of radicular dentition. The in a Class 1 occlusion (neutro-occlusion or normal occlusion 7) do not occlude. They are lo - cated in the interdental space between the thirdincisor and the rst or second premolar. This spaceis also known as \"the bars\" of the mouth. The man-dibular pair of canines is mesially situated to themaxillary pair as in dogs, cats, and humans, andextend deeply into the bone of the mandible leavingonly 10-20% of the crown visible above the gingiva(Fig. 8, A and B). The canine teeth have a single pulp chamber that is very large when newly erupted. The pulp cham-ber can be as close as 5 mm from the tip of the crown,especially in young animals with less internal sec-ondary dentin. The apex is not fully formed forseveral years after eruption, also typical of a radic-ular hypsodont tooth. 8Extraction of the canine teeth requires a surgical procedure because of the necessity of removal of alveolar bone, especially inthe mandible.

An extra-oral ventral to dorsal obliqueview will produce diagnostic images of the maxillarycanines without overlap (Fig. 8, A and B). Judicious crown reduction of the canine teeth is typically performed in horses to \"disarm\" them, pre-vent tongue and dental trauma while bridled, pre-vent human injury when working in and around thehorse, and prevent crown fracture in stalled horsesor in horses that have a Class 2 or disto-occlusionwherein the canines may interfere with one another.The nature of the radicular hypsodont dentition al-lows some careful crown reduction of the canines butcaution and planning with respect to the age of thehorse must be exercised to avoid causing permanentdamage to the tooth. Direct pulp exposure or indi-rect pulp exposure (live dentin containing live odon- toblastic processes usually within a few millimetersof the pulp proper) will result in a degree of pulpitis.In response to the pulpitis, the tooth will undergo aprocess of repair or death, and may result in an\"endo-perio\" lesion whereby the tooth creates a lat-eral canal for drainage into the periodontium. De-pending upon the age of the horse, depth of the pulphorn and degree of exposure and inflammation, thetooth crown may become compromised and brittle. Careful reduction of the crown of the canine tooth in this radicular hypsodont species is possible andbenecial in some situations but overzealous reduc-tion of the canines is not recommended as pulp ex-posure may occur, particularly in younger horses.In the young horse, when pulp exposure is of thehighest concern, the canine may be simply bluntedto remove the sharp cutting edges of the spade- Fig. 8.

In the female horse,the deciduous canines, if present, may be extractedto provide a more comfortable interdental space forthe bit. In contrast with the analogous teeth in adog, crown reduction is not possible in a brachydonttooth without the use of an immediate restorativeprocedure to seal off and protect live odontoblastprocesses within exposed secondary dentin. It has also been previously thought that crown reduction of the canines leads to increased calculusdeposition on the canines. This has not been theauthor's experience, although periodontal disease with concomitant bacterial flora change anywherewithin the horse's mouth may contribute to thiscondition. Calculus should always be removedduring any routine dental procedure, and by doingso, the crowns of the canines may be clearly eval-uated. Calculus on the canine teeth may cover upa pulp granuloma or other evidence of endodonticor periodontal disease such as equine odontoclas-tic tooth resorption and hypercementosis, whichmay manifest itself in the canines before movingmesially into the incisors. 9 Although the canine teeth are not occlusal teeth, they should always be examined and evaluated withevery dental examination and treatment. Carefulcrown reduction may be performed to reduce useful-ness of the canine teeth as weapons, to decreaseinterference with the bit and prevent damage to thetooth by the horse. Occasionally, extraction of acanine tooth is necessary, but this can be a majororal surgery. Take-home points from each section include:Know the eruption and exfoliation schedule of the horse Do not remove excessive tooth structure from the deciduous dentition especially in the caseof the incisors Unless necessary, do not remove deciduous dentition before the teeth are ready to shedand permanent dentition is visible especiallyin the case of the fourth premolars Wolf teeth may require removal or may be left in place per the owner and their veterinarianand they are best extracted with an assort- ment of luxators and an orthopedic mallet Canine teeth should always be evaluated with any comprehensive oral health assessmentand treatment The canine teeth, especially the mandibular teeth, require experience and surgical skill toremove Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Charles, DVM, MA Formal mentorship programs improve employee satisfaction, retention and recruitment1and are not only a critical tool for the equine practice owner, but for the equine associate veterinarian as well. Under-standing the role of the mentor, the role of the mentee, and the critical skill sets necessary to form aneffective mentor-mentee relationship ensures a successful 1. The idea of \"mentoring\" has been around for over1000 years and the rst use of the concept datesback to its use in Greek mythology in The Odyssey by Homer. However, the word \"mentor\" did notappear in the English language until after 1750 atwhich time it began to represent a sort-of fathergure who took someone under his wing to shepherdprofessionally, often for long periods of time. Thementor was the authority gure and chose the per-son/people he would mentor. 2Its modern deni- tion is somewhat vague but is usually a seniorworker who provides guidance and mentorship tothe younger employee so that the younger employeecan learn and grow in his or her position within theorganization. In the beginning, these programswere not formalized, nor were outcomes measuredand their success or failure was largely due to themore experienced employee's skill as a mentor.In the current equine veterinary job market, newgraduates, especially those in the Millenial Genera-tion, are increasingly choosing practices that have aformal mentorship program and are directing whatthose programs will look like. In fact, young work-ers say they value mentorship, coaching, and train-ing more than they value money. 3Because theMillenial Generation makes up the majority of new graduates and those early in their career, it is im-perative that seasoned practitioners pay attention totheir needs and understand the characteristics thatlead to a successful mentorship experience. Ifthose in equine practice are going to recruit andretain the next generation of practitioners, a men-torship program strategy is critical. In the last 10-15 years, organizations have begun evaluating mentorship programs to determinewhether the programs are successful and some re-search has been done to better identify the charac-teristics necessary to be an effective mentor ormentee, while also elucidating the characteristicsthat make a mentorship program successful. Al-though this research is limited and much more workin this area is needed, a study done in 2013, byStraus et al 4looked at mentor-mentee relationships and provided an excellent overview of specic char-acteristics that lead to positive outcomes. This pa-per will explore their ndings and provide apractical framework for both mentors and menteesto consider when evaluating and/or setting up aformal mentorship program in equine practice.Specically, this paper will weave together the char-acteristics of a successful mentoring relationship 76 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS NOTESwith both the characteristics of effective mentorsand the characteristic of effective mentees with anemphasis on what early and mid-career equine prac-titioners can do to make sure they know how toevaluate a program while also better understandingtheir role as either a mentee or a mentor. 2. Characteristics of Successful Mentoring Relationships When considering entering into a mentor relation-ship, it is important for both the mentor and menteeto understand what characteristics can help providea framework for success. It is also helpful to knowwhat things can lead to failed mentoring relation-ships. Straus et al 4identied ve characteristics of an effective mentoring relationship. These include the following: 1. Reciprocity: bidirectional nature of mentor- ing, including consideration of strategies tomake the relationship sustainable and mu-tually rewarding. 2. Mutual respect: respect for the mentor and mentee's time, effort, and qualications. 3. Clear expectations: expectations of the re- lationship are outlined at the onset and re-visited over time; both mentor and menteeare held accountable to these expectations. 4. Personal connection: human connection be- tween the mentor and mentee. 5. Shared values: around the mentor and mentee's approach to research, clinical work,and personal life. They also identied characteristics and conse- quences of failed mentoring relationships that canserve as warnings to mentees and a list of things toavoid for mentors. These include poor communica-tion, lack of commitment, personality differences,perceived competition (or real), conflicts of interest,and a mentor's lack of experience. 4 Equine practitioners, whether in academia, pri- vate practice, industry, or other venues withinequine veterinary medicine, are incredibly busy.This is also true whether one is new in their careeror more seasoned. Thus, taking on a mentor/men-tee role can be seen as just another thing to add tothe list without much thought on how to enter intosuch a relationship or what parameters will helpensure a successful outcome for both the mentor andthe mentee. Making sure that both the mentor andmentee understand the pros and cons of mentoringrelationships will take time on the front end, butunderstanding these ideas by taking the time nec-essary leads to much more likelihood of success. 3. Characteristics of Effective Mentees Because the Millenial Generation is driving the de-velopment of formal mentorship programs in veter-inary medicine, some of the responsibility of whatthe program looks like should come from the men-tee. 3Straus et al4identied several characteristics of effective mentees which include the following: 1. Mentees should be open to feedback and be active listeners. 2. Mentees should be responsible, paying atten- tion to time lines and taking responsibilityfor \"driving the relationship.\" 3. Mentees should show respect for their men- tor by respecting meeting times, being pre-pared for meetings, attending meetings withtopics for discussion, recognizing the mentormay have competing demands (i.e. meetingwith other mentees, their own deadlines). This quote, taken from a participant in Straus' study exemplies the expectations of today's mentee. \"You can't just go in and be an undifferentiated blob about what you want, you have to really havethought before you go in and meet with your mentorabout what the issue is that you need help with andyou know it's much more useful if you bring yourown analysis in with you and then the mentor cangive you their analysis and you can talk.\" 4 Thus, new grads and early career equine practi- tioners play a huge role in developing meaningfulmentoring relationships and ne tuning these skillsduring veterinary school is a must. 4. Characteristics of Effective Mentors Although the responsibility of the mentoring rela-tionship is shifting and changing as the MillenialGeneration enters the workforce, the mentor stillplays a large role in the mentoring relationship andStraus' study provides several ideas about whattypes of characteristics lead to being an effectivementor which are listed below. 1. Mentors should be altruistic. 2. Mentors should be honest, trustworthy, and active listeners. 3. Effective mentors have substantial mentor- ship experience. 4. Effective mentors have professional experi- ence (including networks or colleagues andcollaborators) that can facilitate menteedevelopment. 5. Effective mentors exhibit important rela- tional characteristics, including being acces-sible and able to identify and support thedevelopment of potential strengths and skillsin their mentees. 4 Further, the Coalition of Counseling Centers, Inc. (CCC)/Mentoring Group suggests that mentors con-sider the following before entering into a mentoringrelationship. 1. Have a good rationale for being (or not being) a mentor. 2. When asked to mentor, don't say \"yes\" or \"no\" too quickly. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 77THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS3. Recognize all you have to offer. 4. Negotiate several factors (including the structure of the relationship, how long willthe relationship last, how often and wherewill you meet, what will the mentee work onin terms of goals and development activities,how will the mentor and mentee give eachother feedback, how will you handle dis-agreements, what is condential, and howmuch you will share with others). 5. Help your mentees lead the process.6. Provide encouragement frequently.7. Be ready to transition when it is time. 2 With the gender shift that is happening in equineveterinary medicine, understanding the changingrole of the mentor (away from father gure toward amore collaborative mutual relationship) is critical.The characteristics listed above combined with ashared development of the relationship betweenmentor and mentee is more likely to result in apositive mentoring relationship, one that is not onlybenecial to the mentee, but is also benecial for thementor. 5. Conclusion In closing, the mentor-mentee relationship is onethat requires attention to the characteristics thatlead to success. Fortunately, the work by Strauset al 4gives equine practitioners a framework to better understand these characteristics and look for them when considering entering a mentoring rela-tionship. The nal thing to consider is all the waysa mentor can help a mentee. If the mentee knowswhat they are looking for and the mentor is aware ofwhether he or she can provide it, the chance forwin-win is increased. Again, Straus et al 4provide a list of three types of actions that mentors can taketo help the mentoring relationship in a positive man- ner. These include 1) providing career guidance(includes advising, advocacy, networking, creatingopportunities, goal setting, career monitoring, help-ing mentees navigate institutions/organizations,providing feedback, acting as a sounding board), 2)offering emotional support (sharing their own feel-ings honestly and encouraging their mentees to dothe same, helping to identify possible stressors,check in to see how mentee is doing), and 3) helpingthe mentee focus on work/life balance. 4 By taking an evidence-based approach to the men- toring relationship, equine practitioners, both youngand old, mentor and mentee, can more effectivelyensure that high quality equine veterinary medicineis passed on from one generation to the next.

Introduction As veterinarians we are trained to treat horses andmake them well. But how do we make our businesswell? Throughout my career I have seen great vet-erinarians falter because they were not good busi-ness people. Although I received a great veterinaryeducation it did not prepare me for the businessworld. How do we bridge that gap with the areaswe have little or no knowledge in? In my veterinary business I have always felt that I needed to surround myself with people who hadmore experience than I. I have been very fortunateto have had many mentors who have helped me notonly with my career but also my personal and familylife. What is a mentor? I recently read an article in theSan Antonio Business Journal titled, \"You Can't Do It Alone\" by Hilary Burns. She described amentor as a person you can tell the good, the bad,and the ugly to, someone that you should feel com-fortable sharing the intimate details of your careerwith. It should be someone you can trust. In myopinion it is possible to have mentors from manydifferent walks of life and in many different stagesin your life. I have an attorney who is a mentor.I have an accountant who is a mentor. My dad's oldboss has been a huge mentor especially as I gotfurther into my career and in my life. If you are asfortunate as I am even your wife and children might be able to act as mentors in certain cases. I havemany veterinarians who have also acted as mentorsin my life. A good mentor to me is someone who Ican be completely open with. Someone who will tellyou when you are wrong or going in the wrong di-rection or someone who lets you know when you aredoing things correctly. But also to me a mentor issomeone I can learn from. That to me is the valueof a mentor. So why do we need mentors? What is the value of having mentors? There have been so many times in my career that I needed advice on something. Aswe struggle to balance work and family and run abusiness there is always a need to get an opinionfrom someone else. Am I making the right deci-sion? How should I react to my employee's wantsand needs? What should I do in this situation?Surround yourself with people who can help youanswer those questions. What did they do in thissituation? How did they become successful? Whydo you do things that way? How often should you meet with mentors? I think this answer is different for everyone. In my veter-inary study group we meet twice a year. On someof my personal mentors I try to meet once or twice ayear for lunch, just to catch up and talk aboutthings. If I have a question or a problem that I AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 79THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS NOTESneed help with then I reach out immediately towhom I deem the most appropriate. How did these people become mentors? As I stated earlier, I try to surround myself with peoplewho have more knowledge and experience than me.I actively look for people who I feel would be helpfulor inspirational to me. Some of these relationshipshave evolved over many years and started backwhen I was a kid. But others have come throughacquaintances or people I have come into contactwith through my everyday business. My advice isto always look around for people who might inspireyou and/or become possible mentors. What can a mentor offer? Especially for those of us who are in mid career or even late in our career? 2. Inspiration How many of us have felt like quitting or felt burn-out later in our careers? A mentor can inspire youto become focused and possibly help you to remem-ber why you chose veterinary medicine. 3. Experience As we mature in our practice lives we start to facedifferent problems. It might be more employees,more veterinarians, and more paperwork. A goodmentor is someone who has the experience and re-sources to help you navigate through the differentthings you encounter. 4. Retirement Advice Who do we talk to about retirement advice? Whatif you are the rst person retiring in the practice?Someone who has been there and done that would probably have some very good advice. 5. A Pat on the Back As I walk into my practice every morning as I havedone for over 20 years, I try to come up with ways tomotivate myself and keep everybody else motivatedin the practice. As each year goes by I think tomyself why do I do this and how do I keep a positiveattitude and continue to try to make my practiceflourish, change, and grow. I seek out one of mymentors and they help me realize how fortunate Iam and how great a career veterinary medicine canbe and what a good job I'm doing. Sometimes it isjust that little pat on the back from someone yourespect and trust who makes you realize what agreat job you really have. There are many reasons to have mentors and I have touched on just a few of them. But don't beafraid to seek someone else's help and don't be afraidto tap into someone else's knowledge and talent.It doesn't matter what stage of practice you are in, itis always nice to have a mentor.

Introduction There are a thousand questions you can ask whenthinking of starting a family. When is it the righttime? How am I going to work while pregnant andafter with a child? Will I lose clients while on ma-ternity leave? How much time can I take off onmaternity leave? Can I afford not to work? Whowill watch my baby when I am at work? How willI balance being a mom and a veterinarian? Theseare only a few of the concerns that immediately maycome to mind. Many equine veterinarians havefound ways to raise their children successfully, andeach of them took a different path. All of themfound ways to make it work for their families, andyou will too. Deciding when to start your family is a personal decision, but there will never be the perfect time.Things to consider are the type of practice you arein and how supportive your employer and staffwill be. Has there been another veterinarianthat has paved the path or will you be the rstemployee? It is important to review the employeehandbook to know the pregnancy policy and ndout the state and federal laws that may protectyour job. Determining the amount of time off formaternity leave will depend on several factorssuch as practice policy, nancial support throughsavings/state disability/private disability insur-ance, and clientele pressures.Your ease in managing your career after becoming a parent will vary depending on your personal situ-ation: whether you have family nearby, whether your spouse will be able to provide some of the child's care, what type of a practice you work at andhow accommodating your boss is. When you gurethe economics of paying for the childcare you maynd that you cannot rationalize continuing to workinitially. On the other hand, you may need or wantto continue your professional development right af-ter the birth. No matter whether you decide not togo back to work short or long term, work part time,or full time you will need support from others. Your career may change directions over time to ac- commodate for the many responsibilities of being aparent. Finding the right balance between your responsi- bilities as a veterinarian, mother/father, wife/hus-band, and to yourself is another very personal journey, and may change as your children grow. Nothing else can compare with having a family. It will change your perspective on life and your career. Being a parent comes with challenges, butthere is nothing else more rewarding than to watchchildren grow. The equine veterinary industry de-mands that you be available 24 hours a day, which isdifcult to balance with a quality family life. Again AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 81THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS NOTESit is important to have support from family, friends,and colleagues to help keep things in balance.

The decision to start a new family is not one to betaken lightly. However, when one or multiplemembers of this growing family are part of the vet-erinary eld, the obstacles and challenges faced canbecome exponentially greater. Aside from the longhours, possible emotional fatigue and physical toll,veterinarians, specically those focusing on allthings equine, face potentially serious danger everyday. Planning and instituting precautions prior toexpanding a family can make the transition a mucheasier one and also allow the parent or parents tofocus on the joy of welcoming a new member intotheir family. This paper is intended to assist vet-erinarians looking to expand their family in consid-ering the potential challenges and precautionsassociated with pregnancy, maternity or paternityleave, and pumping breast milk at work. Pregnancy while working around horses presents many challenges as they are quick, powerful, andoften unpredictable animals. A once straightforwardlower-limb laceration become problematic whenbending from the waist and crouching are nearlyimpossible. Euthanasias can become a signicantrisk given that horses often collapse quickly andmay fall forcefully to the ground, or can becomeexcitable. Adequate sedation and proper restraintwill often help to make most situations safe for ev-eryone, but there are some dangers for both mother and fetus that should be avoided. Radiographs are unsafe for a developing fetus; however, this does not mean a pregnant veterinar-ian cannot use this helpful diagnostic tool for 9months. 1Instead, plan ahead, taking enough staff or recruiting extra barn help to assist with anyneeded radiographs. When on emergencies, mostveterinarians nd that many radiographs can waituntil normal hours with severe fractures being theexception. Gases from inhalant anesthesia are also poten- tially harmful and with no clear safe levels estab-lished, it is best to avoid these dangers wheneverpossible. Active scavenge systems, leak checks,and good ventilation systems can help keep anes-thetic gas levels to a minimum. The National In-stitute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)approved chemical cartridge respirator for organic va- pors, or several varieties of supplied air/self containedbreathing apparati can be used in addition to environ-mental precautions to minimize risk to pregnantwomen. NIOSH and the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration (OSHA) have several recom-mendations for safety when using anesthetic gases. There are many decisions pregnant veterinarians must face such as when to tell their employer and AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 83THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS NOTESother staff members, when to start maternity leave,how much leave to take, returning to full- or part-time work, pumping at work, etc. All of these arepersonal choices with no right or wrong answer.Informing an employer sooner rather than later istypically helpful and avoids frustration for everyonewhen radiographs and anesthetic gases are to beavoided. Depending on your clinic's policies andtime on the job, maternity leave may or may not bepaid. Employees looking to expand their familyshould determine whether their clinic offers paidmaternity leave and assess their own nancial situ-ation beforehand. Saving vacation days can oftenhelp defray the lack of income during leave. TheFamily and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows newmothers working in companies of 50 or more employ-ees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave as long asthey have been at their current place of employmentfor at least 1 year. 2Complications for pregnant mothers may also play a role and influence not onlywhen maternity leave is started, but also other re-strictions at work, such as time standing and avoid-ing heavy lifting. After a breastfeeding mother returns to work and has made the decision to continue pumping while atwork, the Department of Labor requires that em-ployers allow adequate breaks for pumping and aspace other than a bathroom in which to do so foremployees covered under the Fair Labor StandardsAct. 2Veterinarian are often salaried employees who are exempt from coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act; however, the Department of Laborencourages all employers to allow for pumping at work and 27 states have laws related to breastfeed-ing or pumping in the workplace. The NationalConference of State Legislatures' Web site has moreinformation for individual states. When new mothers or fathers return to work, some opt to return at a part-time status and may ormay not become full time as their infant ages.Each family will need to decide what arrangementworks best for them and discuss any changes withtheir employer when appropriate. Although thereis no right or wrong answer when it comes to ex-panding a family, there are many decisions andchanges to be made in a small amount of time.With a small amount of planning, the transition intoparenthood can be relatively easy.

The prevalence of nasopharyngealand laryngeal dysfunction with nasal and tracheal obstruction and willbe the focus of this presentation. Upper airwayobstruction may affect a horse's performance orquality of life by interfering with ventilation duringinhalation or exhalation. Alternatively, a changein airflow pattern or airway wall collapse may resultin an abnormal upper respiratory noise. It is im-portant to note that the presence and intensity ofthe abnormal noises are not always correlated withthe degree of airway obstruction. Depending on the gait of the horse and exercise intensity, the horse can use three breathing strate-gies to compensate for an impairment to its ventila-tion 1,2as listed below: 1. Increase its driving inspiratory pressure 2. Uncouple its gait and respiratory frequency (normally a 1:1 ratio)3. Change the duration of its inspiratory and expiratory time (i.e., prolong the time avail-able for inhalation as seen during laryngeal collapse). With continued exercise in the presence of resistive breathing, the change in flow pattern and perhapsmuscle fatigue can lead to further soft tissue col-lapse and even pulmonary damage. Another facetsuspected by many trainers/owners/veterinarians isthat the horse learns to anticipate an anoxic eventand modify its performance accordingly. This \"be-havior\" is difcult to identify and quantify let aloneseparate from the effects of the actual ventilationcompromise. We must rst identify and recognize the clinical problem. It should be noted that 30-43% of horsesexperience multiple obstructions (i.e., comorbid ob-structions). 3,4These may be co-existing disease or induced collapses because of changes in pressuresand flow dynamic caused by the obstruction. 5There- fore, it is especially important to fully identify all theobstructions so that the management/treatment canbe tailored appropriately to the patient. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 85FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE NOTESThis review use preferentially evidence-based data in horses with naturally-occurring diseasewhen available. Data resulting from high-level evidence-based clinical trials gives us the bestguidance on how to clinically approach a problem. Unfortunately, this body of clinical evidence is lim-ited in many elds of veterinary medicine and thatis certainly true in this area of specializa- tion. When high-level evidence base is lacking,data from experimental models is also of value toquantify the various tests and treatments to give usguidance in the management of horses with upperairway obstructions. Information on which diag-nostic method or treatment is preferable can be answered based on determination of the airwaymechanics or frequency analysis of abnormalsounds. However, extrapolations from experimen-tally-created disease in normal horses to horses withnaturally-occurring disease performing differentathletic functions may not be fully appropriate.Experience from trial and error will modify thisguidance. It is hoped that over the years more evidence-based data will replace this \"softer\" guid-ance. In addition, both the recognition and thetreatment remain an \"art\". For example, a Grade4 laryngeal hemiplegia is a seemingly simple andclear description of recurrent laryngeal neuropa-thy (RLN). However, upon inspection of threecases of RLN (Fig. 1), marked differences becomeobvious and the degree of interference with venti-lation differs. The horses in Figure 1, A and Bwere asymptomatic at rest whereas the horse inFigure 1C was dyspneic at rest. The author hopes to properly pay tribute to the many authors of papers and presentations duringthe last few years that have greatly increased ourunderstanding in the diagnosis, pathophysiology,and management of upper airway dysfunction inhorses. This review will also be in line with recentrecommendations to clean up the various terms thathave been used through the years but are not con- sistent with the proper Nomina Anatomica Veteri- naria and yet have been pervasive in the veterinary literature. 6 2. Diagnosis History Horses with upper airway obstruction may have a history of poor performance and/or abnormal upperrespiratory noise. The degree of poor performancesubjectively plays a role in influencing treatment.A racehorse with decreased, yet still satisfactoryperformance may be treated less aggressively thanthe same horse that is nishing 48 lengths behind.Remember to extend the history and the examina-tion beyond concern for upper respiratory obstruc-tion. Hypoxemia from lower airway disease orcardiac arrhythmia is likely to render the upperairway more collapsible and should be addressed. The abnormal noise can happen during inspira- tion, such as in horses with dynamic laryngeal col- lapse, or expiration (more characteristically describedas gurgling). 7,8Although abnormal upper respira - tory noise is a reasonably sensitive test (80-84%)for obstruction of the upper airway, it has a very lowspecicity (25%). 7-10The specicity might be higher except that a percentage of horses (20-30%) are silent despite the presence of an upper airwayobstruction. 7,8,11In addition, many horses have more than one obstruction so the abnormal upper airway noise is not specic.7-10 While gathering a medical history, getting infor- mation on the head position and influence of thedegree of poll flexion on noise production is impor-tant. In sport horses, poll flexion has been reportedto be important in recreating the abnormal upperrespiratory noise and is one of the reasons whyoverground endoscopy (OGE) is the gold standard inthose horses doing this activity. 9,12-14 Fig. 1.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREGurgling noise (i.e., also described as snoring or a rattling noise) during exhalation is reported inhorses with soft palate displacement. It has beenassociated with fluttering of the caudal free edge ofthe soft palate displacement. 9,11Franklin et al, 2004 reported that the highest amplitude of fre-quency associated with soft palate vibration inhorses ranges from 50-150 Hz. 9By inspection, we have observed that some horses have marked flut- tering of the caudal edge of the soft palate whereasin others the palate billows up and down at therespiratory frequency ( /H110112 Hz). This can be vari- able during the exercise intensity given that gener-ally more fluttering is heard as the horse's exerciseintensity decreases. This may explain \"silent dis-placers\" and horses in which the noise is only heardwhen the horse pulls up. It is worth noting thatbecause complex (i.e., multiple co-existing) obstruc-tions are common, additional noises of alar foldsfluttering, palate billowing, and medial deviation ofthe aryepiglottic folds would \"muddle\" the charac-teristic \"gurgling\" noise. The noise described with vocal cord and/or aryte- noid collapse is also a common abnormal noise andhas been described as \"whistling\" or \"roaring\" and isheard during inhalation. 4,8,14,15Spectrum analysis of this noise has revealed three frequency bands centered around 300 Hz, 1.6 kHz, and 3.8 kHz.11,16 These latter reports were done in horses with exper-imentally induced left laryngeal hemiplegia andtherefore some slight differences can be expected ina clinical population. The range of intensity ofsounds would be different and degree and onset ofcollapse would be quite variable in a clinicalpopulation. 10 In summary, the absence of noise is not an assur- ance of a fully patent airway and the aforemen-tioned noises are suggestive of the cause of theabnormal sounds but are neither a perfect nor acomplete indicator of the full spectrum of airwaycompromise or whether surgery is or is not needed. Physical Examination The basis of an upper airway examination is to per-form a thorough evaluation of the upper airways.This starts with assessment of the presence or ab-sence of drainage at the nostrils. A critical evalu-ation is to assess the symmetry of the airflow:although masses/enlargements of the sinuses orventral or dorsal conchae are a common cause ofairflow obstruction, one cause that can be missed ishorses with Horner syndrome. Although the typi-cal sign of Horner syndrome is sweating rostral tothe site of lesion of the sympathetic nerve, we havefound that the sweating at rest seems to resolveearlier than the sympathetic dysfunction of the na-sal capillary bed. The resulting loss of tonic sym-pathetic tone can result in ipsilateral occluding clinical feature that, in the author's experience, has been quite reliable is thevertical position of the eyelashes (Fig. 2) compared with the unaffected contralateral side. This isassociated with enophthalmos and prolapse ofthe third eyelid seen with syndrome. 18,19 External assessment of the external boney contourof the head and sinus is important to perform toidentify xed obstruction created by mass or fluidenlarging the sinus. The laryngeal cartilages should then be identify laryngeal structural malformation andcysts. 20,21One should specically assess and com - pare the left and right thyroid lamina as well as thecricothyroid spaces, which are generally abnormalin cases of laryngeal dysplasia or fourth branchialarch defect. 20,21The affected side, usually the right side, has a larger cricothyroid space and a more elevated dorsal extension of the thyroid carti-lage that \"feels\" like a smaller muscular process.Both jugular veins be palpated for patencyand enlargement given that jugular thrombophlebi-tis may be associated with vagal and recurrent la-ryngeal nerve injury. The cricoarytenoid dorsalis(CAD) muscles should then be palpated for evidenceof atrophy. Most textbooks describe palpation ofthe left and right muscular processes to identifyatrophy of the CAD. However, in the author's ex-perience, palpation of the caudal aspect of the cricoidis more sensitive because of the factors listed below: 1. The cricopharyngeus muscle is not overlying the target area as it is with the muscularprocess 2. The muscle compartment palpated on the cau- dal aspect of the cricoid cartilage is the cau-dolateral compartment of the CAD, which ismore affected with atrophy in horses withRLN Upper respiratory dysfunction is not only a concern of airway patency (i.e., respiratory), it is also a con- Fig. 2.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREcern of the protective mechanism ofthe larynx (i.e., deglutitive). Dysphagia, esopha-geal reflux, or laryngeal and/or nasopharyngeal in-competence may all result in penetration of feed andwater into the trachea and may lead to lower airwayinfection and pneumonia. Once it is recognizedthat tracheal aspiration is occurring, one should alsoevaluate the lower airways and evaluate systemicsigns of infection. Resting Endoscopy Generic Respiratory ExaminationResting endoscopic examination is the standard andis most commonly used as a diagnostic aid to assesspatency and abnormalities of the upper airways. The examination is performed with or without anose twitch or lip chain and preferably withoutsedation. Many authors have emphasized thatsedation may interfere with the evaluation of la-ryngeal function in horses. 22-24Sedation with xylazine hydrochloride, detomidine hydrochloride,or acepromazine maleate movements of the arytenoid cartilages, pre-dominantly by decreasing the abduction of the leftarytenoid. 24In addition, abnormalities such as nasopharyngeal collapse are difcult to reliably identify from resting examination after sedation.In the author's experience, sedation can also leadto a worsening of a clinical nasopharyngeal col-lapse and can also lead to a false diagno-sis. Therefore, the nasal passage, nasopharynx,larynx, and extrathoracic trachea are masses, cysts, the (pDDSP), andepiglottic abscess can be readily assessed. Dy-namic obstruction such as nasopharyngeal collapse,palatal instability, and intermittent dorsal displace-ment of the soft palate (iDDSP), and various formsof laryngeal collapse are more difcult to identifyand their signicance is much harder to characterizebased on a resting exam. Epiglottic retroversion and tracheal collapse are two abnormalities that can sometimes be suspectedfrom resting endoscopy although they can only beconrmed by exercising endoscopy or dynamic imag-ing. Epiglottic retroversion can be suspected inhorses in which the epiglottis is more dorsal thannormal and close to the roof of the nasopharynx (Fig.3). Tracheal collapse can be suspected if it occursduring endoscopic exam of the extrathoracic trachea orif it induced with simultaneous thelarynx. (Note: Radiographic assessment can also de- See Imaging Digital Radiography section). Guttural pouch examination is also important to perform given that disease in this area can affect the neural function of the vagal and glossopharyn-geal nerves, which affect stability of the upperairways. 25-27Guttural pouch empyema, mycosis,and enlargement of the nasopharyngeal lymph nodes can all interfere with the vagal, pharyngealbranch of the vagus, hypoglossal, or glossopharyngeal nerves. Neuritis and/or neuropraxia of these nasopharynx, dysphagia,and/or pDDSP. Guttural pouch tympany is an-other cause of collapse of the roof of the nasopharynxwithout inflammatory disease in the gutturalpouch. 28-30Finally, endoscopy should evaluate the size of the stylohyoid bone and the mobility of the temporohyoid articulation.31-33Although temporo sectionwould suggest THO. Palatal Problems Palatal abnormalities may (i.e., cleftand palatal cyst) of functional iDDSP. Congenitalcleft palate can be observed to be on the midline orassymetrical. 34-36The tip of the epiglottis can be observed with the endoscope looking ventrally at the level of the cleft. Oropharyngeal mucosa and pala-tine tonsils 37can be readily seen. Lower airway evaluation is very important to decide whether the cleft needs to be repaired and what the proper delayis before treatment. 34,35,38 Palatal instability and iDDSP are both very common causes of airway obstruction and abnor-mal upper airway noise during exercise. Diagno-sis of iDDSP based on endoscopy has a very lowdiagnostic accuracy when performed based on a rest-ing examination. 7,39-41Dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP) seen during resting endoscopy, considered with the positive history of making anoise during exercise, was only correct in predicting Fig. 3. Resting endoscopic image of the larynx of a 14-year-oldFriesian mare with epiglottic retroversion conrmed during ex-ercise. Note the elevated position epiglottis duringexercise. 88 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK in 50% of cases.3Identication of ulcer on the caudal free edge of the soft palate may be an indication of iDDSP but is also observed with sub-epiglottic ulcer/granuloma, entrapment. Flaccidity by by nasal occlusionis not reliable evidence of DDSP given that these areseen also in nondisplacers during exercise. 40When DDSP is induced, one can observe the caudal aspectof the soft palate not only for the presence of ulcers,cysts, and granuloma but also evidence of priorstaphylectomy (Fig. 4). Resting identication of persistent DDSP (pDDSP) is reasonably accurate. The exception is in somehorses, which will have been induced to displace andwill not replace their soft palate until the twitch isremoved. The examination should then proceed to-ward identifying the cause of the displacement:is there pain in the nasopharynx or laryngeal area?Look for evidence of denervation to palatal acute orchronic epiglottitis. The author uses the DDSP grade in Table 1 to categorized status of the soft palate on resting en-doscopy (Table 1).Recurrent Laryngeal Neuropathy RLN is of hemi- plegia or arytenoid and/or vocal cord collapse duringexercise. The value of a resting grade is to have asystem that can reliably describe the ndings of aresting exam in relation to laryngeal respiratoryfunction. A signicant amount of work focuses onthe correlation of resting laryngeal grade at restcompared with exercise. The original proposedfour-grade system 42was further rened during the 2003 Havemeyer workshop (Table 2).43How useful is this laryngeal grading system beyond describing to others the apparent status of the laryngeal function?A few recent studies have looked at the predictive value of the four broad resting laryngeal grades inracehorses. Horses with a laryngeal Grade of I and IIare associated with good performances. 44-46Clearly, however, not all horses with laryngeal Grade III have laryngeal collapse during exercise nor do all laryngealGrade I and II show the absence of laryngeal col-lapse. 3,7,42,47Barakzai and Dixon correlated the rest - ing Havermeyer laryngeal grade with exercising gradein 272 horses. 3They reported that 96 and 92% of laryngeal Grade I and II, respectively, did not have laryngeal collapse whereas only 34% of laryngealGrade III had full laryngeal abduction. 3Garret et al, 2010 also emphasized the value of the Havermeyer laryngeal sub-grade in a study of with laryngeal sub-grade of II.2 hadlower earnings than horses with a laryngeal grade of Ior II.1. 48The value of the laryngeal sub-grade in Grade III horses was showed by Barakzai and Dixon, 2011.3Indeed, horses given a Sub-grade III.1, III.2, or III.3 had good correlation with increasing collapse during exercise (Grade A, no collapse; B, partial col-lapse; and C, collapse) medial to neutral position ofarytenoid ( /H9267/H110050.43; P/H11005.0017). The aforementioned data focuses on correlation of laryngeal collapse during exercise with resting en-doscopic ndings. Yet what is the correlation withactual RLN? This was explored by a few au-thors. 49-51Horses with decreased abduction of the left arytenoid have the typical neuromuscular signs associated with distal axonopathy, which is progres-sive denervation with evidence of reinnervation. 52 It was rst reported that in all horses evaluated, Fig. 4. A 3-year-old Thoroughbred lly with a laryngeal Grade3.2 and evidence of prior staphylectomy. Table 1.

Note: the author considers Grade 2-4 to be more likely to indicate clinical disease and Grade 0-2 within normal limits. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 89FRANK MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREthere was histopathological evidence of left RLNeven in horses with resting laryngeal Grade I andexercise Grade A. 50,53Collins et al, 2009 demon - strated a statistically signicant correlation be-tween the severity of the histopathological muscleassessment of the left CAD and the Havemeyer la-ryngeal grade and sub-grades. 50In summary, the well-dened, and universally adopted Havermeyer resting laryngeal grade (Table 2) allows a fair andvalidated description of the status of a given horse'srespiratory laryngeal function at the time of exam-ination. It broadly and ipsilaterally correlates withthe RLN disease process (with the caveat that allhorses may have the disease), and has fair predic-tion of laryngeal collapse during exercise. It isworth noting that the laryngeal ultrasound dichoto-mized assessment (i.e., normal vs abnormal) of theechogenicity of the cricoarytenoid lateralis (CAL)muscle has a better sensitivity and specicity and istherefore likely a predictive value of laryngeal col-lapse during exercise. 54,55However, laryngeal ul - trasound should not replace the resting assessmentof the larynx given that the luminal side of thelarynx is not well evaluated with laryngeal ultra-sound. 56Small or localized luminal side arytenoid chondromas, arytenoid subluxation, and abnormal movements of the arytenoid cartilage are likely to bemissed on laryngeal ultrasound, not to mention allother important Resting evaluation of the protective mechanism of the larynx is another important value of endos-copy. Dysphagia is observed in neonatal foalswith apparent lowing guttural pouch diseases with extension ofthe disease or surgical trauma to adjacent periph-eral nerves. 27,58-62Dysphagia is also reported as a complication of various upper-airway surgical procedures such as staphylectomy,63-65arytenoid - ectomy,66-69and laryngoplasty (Table ).15,70-75 Dysphagia is broadly described as nasal regurgi- tation of feed material or water and tracheal aspi-ration of feed material. Equine practitioners havebeen increasingly frequently asked to treat horseswith swallowing disorders/dysphagia. Its true def- inition is passage of food, saliva, secretions, and/orliquids past the vocal folds into the extrathoracic tra-chea. 76The author has observed (no doubt as have others) that the site of aspiration is different in horses with a cleft palate compared with that seen after alaryngoplasty or arytenoidectomy. Furthermore, dys-phagia after laryngoplasty may be in our estimationdue to the following: 1. Failure of the arytenoid cartilages and vocal fold to meet on the midline to protect thetrachea 2. Predominant scarring of the left dorsolaryn- geal area that prevents laryngeal elevationTable 2.

Transient asynchrony, flutter or delayed movements are seen.2. There is asymmetry of the rima glottidis much of the time due to reduced mobility of the affected arytenoid and vocalfold but there are occasions, typically after swallowing ornasal occlusion, when full symmetrical abduction is achievedand maintained.

Esophageal regurgitation (because of damage to the cranial-esophageal sphincter or brosisinvolving the esophagus causing a simpleobstruction) The goal of endoscopy during swallowing is to identify the mechanism or site of respiratory in-tegrity incompetence. These sites are upper esoph-ageal regurgitation. 73This is an emerging eld for surgeons and has been observed with and with- out any prior surgical intervention.77,78Barium swallows are of value in identifying those yet they are less readily available so the endoscopic swal-lowing test is used more often. Typically, the horse is fasted overnight to en- sure a good appetite. The endoscope is placedthrough the right nasal passage and secured to thehorse halter as performed for treadmill endoscopy(alternatively, an overground endoscope can beused). The horse or foal is then fed at the heightat which the aspiration or coughing is reported.In foals, the endoscopy is performed while itnurses on the mare as that is when the aspirationis most common. In adult horses, it is at shoulderheight. During barium studies, the horse forms abolus in the caudal aspect of the nasopharynx,caudal to the base of the tongue which is detectedby elevation of the caudal aspect of the soft palate.During swallowing, this bolus is elevated over theclosed larynx aspect of the larynx being sealed by theary-epiglottic folds). The above three sites of la-ryngeal competency can then be evaluated as wellas the three mechanisms of laryngeal closure.In severely dysphagic cases, only one or two swal-lows can be observed given that after contamina-tion assessment of its source may be prevented.In addition to looking for the site of the feed pen-etration, one should conrm and evaluate the fol- lowing critical sites: 1. Verify that the epiglottis is indeed retrovert- ing properly. This is determined by observ-ing the epiglottis fully covering symmetricallythe arytenoid cartilage and \"coming backdown\" at the end of the swallowing phase asthe nasopharyngeal constriction is released 2. Proper midline contact of the vocal fold and arytenoid cartilage (Fig. 5, A-C) is occurring 3. Esophageal reflux is not occurring (Fig. 6) Dynamic Endoscopy Fixed airway obstruction resulting in resistivebreathing can generally be identied by externalexamination of the upper airway and by restingendoscopy. Many obstructions occur only or moremarkedly during exercise because of one or more ofthe following: increased respiratory pressures, in-creased respiratory frequency, and decrease inspira-tory and expiratory times associated withexercise. 1,65,79,80The reduction in airway geometry results in changes in kinetic energy, velocity, and turbulence in the airway5,81which results in second - ary collapses. Therefore, an airway obstruction may change airflow pattern and wall-pressures and explainwhy secondary collapse may also be observed and havebeen reported in nearly 50% of horses. Dynamic endoscopy is an important diagnostic test to allow recognition of dynamic collapse or to conrmthe absence of airway obstruction. 82Dynamic endos - copy during exercise was rst performed using stan-dard flexible videoendoscopes with horses exercisingon a high-speed treadmill (HSTE) (HST). This form of dynamic endoscopy was rst popularized byclinicians at Tufts University in the 1980s. 86 Many other equine clinicians40,42,84-86have per - formed those dynamic exams as it became the goldstandard for the diagnosis of upper airway abnormal-ities in horses. It remained the gold standard proba-bly until a few years after the introduction ofcommercially available overground endoscopes(OGEs). 87,88The advantages of HSTE are that the protocols are well established leading to a maximal or near-maximal exercise intensity.4,40,42,83,85,89-95InTable 3.

Finally, a key point is that the desiredexercise intensity is decided by the team doing theexamination and not the trainer/owner. In 2008-2009, Tamzali et al, Desmarizieres et al, and Pollock et al, introduced OGE. 87,96,105OGE offers an even closer approximation of upper-airwaymorphology and function during exercise/competi- tion. This is because it allows the head position,action of the riders (including jockeys and drivers),presence of the sulky, and subjective elements ofcompetitions (i.e., grounds, temperature, environ-ments, adjacent horses, etc.) to be reproduced. 97-101 This approximation to the exercise intensity in com-petition became even closer when OGE was per-formed during qualifying races. 98Both dynamic endoscopic techniques (HSTE and OGE) are prefer- able to diagnosis solely made based on resting en-doscopy. Indeed, numerous studies have reportedthe low correlation of resting endoscopy and dy-namic endoscopy regardless of whether the examwas performed on HST 3,7,40,42or overground14,98,102 or both.82How do we compare the value of dy - namic exam during HST vs overground? Thestrength of overground examinations are obviousand have been well described. They \"should\" mostclosely resemble the situation during the competi-tion or athletic competition. However, as pointedout by Allen et al, 2010, the distance that flat Thor-oughbred racehorses are tested at is not always (orperhaps more accurately not often) as long as theyare during their last race. 82Unlike the situation during HSTE, the trainer has a strong (if not full) control of the intensity and duration of the exercisetest. The author nds that it is often the trainer'sdesire to add endoscopy (i.e., OGE) to the pro-grammed training session (i.e., length and intensityof the horse's workout), rather than program theexercise test that best simulates the racing condi-tions. To be sure, this is usually due to the train-er's important priorities listed below: 1. Prevent injury to the horse 2. Consider the horse's most recent training effort Fig. 5.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE3. Use the exercise intensity that leaves the horse on track to perform its next race This typically results in exercise tests that are oflower intensity (speed, duration or both) than thoseexperienced during competition. Allen and Frank-lin 2010, 103reviewed exercise protocols in the United Kingdom noting that the detection of someupper airway abnormalities, specically iDDSP, re-quires strenuous exercise and therefore have beeneasier or more frequently detected (i.e., accurately)during treadmill examination. 82In that aforemen - tioned review, the authors found that the total over-ground exercise test was quite variable (800-6100m), some in straight gallop and others in circulargallop), some on the flat and some on the incline.The peak speed achieved in those overground testswere slower than those during racing. In the au-thor's experience, these results are quite represen-tative of the obstacles and the main weakness of theoverground test. The OGE exercise tests are closerto the situation experienced during racing/competi-tion in all aspects except in regard to exercise inten-sity. It has been found that only the lower limits ofan OGE exercise test can be reliable set. The min-imally acceptable limits (unless the horse experi-ences clinical signs very early during the com-petition) under which we will perform the test variesfor flat racehorses vs trotters/pacers. In Thorough-bred racehorses we only do an examination if thehorse is exercised at least 5 furlongs (1200 m) andpreferably in company. In harness horses, the min-imal distance of the test is 1600 m. If the minimalexercise protocol is not dened, the veterinarian isliable to make false-negative conclusions in regardto the status of the upper airway (miss a diagnosis ofDDSP or palatal instability) 82or underestimate the degree of laryngeal collapse. As previously reported, injury rates are very low during both HSTE4,104and OGE,105,106although the perception is that HSTE has more risks.87Injuries occur during both types of examinations (HSTE and OGE) associated with exercise intensity. On thetreadmill, additional risk is present to the horse if ittries to jump off, but in practitioners' experience ofthousands of horses, this is extremely rare. It hasbeen observed that the injury rate is very low withproper protocol and the most common (if not onlyinjury) are minor hoof injuries related to losing ashoe during exercise. During overground endos-copy, the added injury risk is to the rider/driver andthis is also very rare. 88 In the author's practice we use both HST and OGE but do not do both examinations on the same horse.Because of the affect of head positions and poll flex-ion collections in sport horses, OGE examinationsare preferred in all horses that perform those activ-ities. Thoroughbred racehorses are examined pref-erably with OGE unless a more completeexamination (i.e., including a lower airway and/orcardiology exam) is medically indicated, then anHSTE is performed. We believe that the diagnostic value of dynamic endoscopy is equivalent in Thor-oughbred racehorses regardless of whether HSTE orOGE is used as long as criteria for exercise intensityare respected. In trotter/pacers because of thehigher prevalence of co-existing morbidity (requir-ing additional physiological testing), we believe thatHSTE is preferred. Imaging Digital Radiography Imaging of the upper airways has107-111been used for years to assess the patency of the nasal passage and the influence of paranasal sinus diseases on theairway. Standard lateral, lateral oblique, and thedorsoventral radiographs (probably the most usefulview) are used for assessment of patency and todene the geometric abnormalities of the nasal pas-sages. High-denition endoscopy is more accurateto assess patency of the upper airway but obstruc-tions may be further dened by radiography al-though CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most complete modalities for thatlatter purpose. Radiographs of the nasopharynx have been used to assess the diameter of the nasopharynx with var-ious head positions, 100,112and the position of the larynx in relation to the nasopharynx,94,113,114and other general assessment of those two areas.115 The relationship between native epiglottic length and prevalence of DDSP is no longer viewed as hav-ing much clinical signicance. 41However, this modality is used most commonly to assess the ana- tomical location of the larynx post laryngeal tie-forward. For that purpose, the head is placed in anextended position. 113Objective measurement of the position of the center of the lateral aspect of the basihyoid bone, the ossication in the thyroid carti-lage, and the thyrohyoid bone junction to the thyroidlamina have been described. 94,113It is well estab thelaryngeal tie-forward procedure is determined tobe appropriate or satisfactory if the center of ossi-cation of the thyroid cartilage is rostral to the thy-rohyoid bone and the epiglottis overlaps thestylohyoid bone on the lateral view of the area. Radiography of the trachea larynx is not com- monly performed and is really limited to lateralradiographs. 116It has been shown that unlike dogs and humans, the timing of the radiographs in refer- ence to the respiratory cycle is not as important as atrest; the trachea during exhalation vs inhalation reported. 116Lateral radiographs of the extra thoracic trachea can thus be used to assess tracheal collapse on that plane.117Collapse from AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 93FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREside to side has been observed and is not detected bythis lateral cervical view of course. Ultrasound Examination Upper airway endoscopy, whether it be performedat rest or exercise, gives an assessment of therespiratory function of the nasopharynx and lar-ynx. Structural assessment of the laryngeal car-tilage and supportive muscles must be done through imaging. The normal ultrasonographic anatomy ofthe equine larynx was rst described by Chalmerset al in 2006. 56Chalmer's paper describes four ac - coustic windows to get a complete examination ofthe larynx:1. Rostroventral window: to image the basihy- oid, lingual process and area rostral to thosestructures. That window was used in refer-ence for cases of localized swelling or to assessinvolvement of the ceratohyoid bone in horseswith hypo-glossal nerve(s)) or THO 2. Mid-ventral window images of the area be- tween the thyroid cartilage and the basihyoidbone: this is helpful in assessment ofwhether the sutures from a prior tie-forwardare tight (Fig. 7) or to guide laser treatment ofthe thyroepiglottic articulation 3. Lateral window (Fig. 8) showing the relation- ship between the cricoid, thyroid, and aryte-noid cartilage as well as the CAL andcricothyroideus muscle (CTh) 4. Caudoventral window at the thyroid notch (cricothyroid space) allow imaging of the vocalfolds After that study, our team started to perform laryn- geal ultrasound to better dene and characterize thearytenoid cartilage and unusual swelling (Fig. 9, Aand B) or chondritis (Fig. 10, A and B). Indeed,laryngeal ultrasound gives the clinicians knowledgeof the proper cartilage anatomy (shape and thick-ness) and the ability to detect changes from what isnormal. With regard to the larynx, the exam isfacilitated by the fact that the contralateral side canserve as control (unless of course the horse has bi-lateral disease). Garrett et al, 2013 described thatthe features of arytenoid chondritis in the horseincreased cross-sectional area view from the lateralwindow both in the longitudinal and transverse Fig. 7.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREplanes, compared with thecontralateral side, small hyperechogenic foci (pres-ence of gas) within the cartilage, and luminalmasses can be seen. 118This is consistent with surgical ndings, and the value in cases of arytenoid chondritis is to identify those with nondenitive en-largement of the arytenoid cartilage or to identifyabscess that would guide the treatment towarddrainage as opposed to partial arytenoidectomy. Differences in echogenicity in the CAL muscle in horses with RLN and the contralateral (presumablynormal) side were noted. That same observationwas conrmed in two separate studies. 54,55 It is logical since both the CAD and the CAL are innervated by the ipsilateral recurrent laryngealnerve. With the naturally-occurring RLN or withtrauma/damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, both muscles are subjected to denervation atrophy.This is perhaps because innervation to the CAL islonger than to the CAD; histopathological evidenceof denervation is more severe in the CAL (an adduc-tor muscle) that the CAD muscle. 119,120Therefore, the status of the CAL muscle should be a good sur- rogate of the evaluation of the CAD muscle (i.e., beable to identify the disease earlier or easier as atro-phy is more severe) whose decit is actually respon-sible for the laryngeal collapse. Both groups who reported on laryngeal ultra- sound in diagnosis of RLN expected originally thatthe cross-section and/or width of the CAL (Fig. 8) ofthe horses affected by RLN, and thus subjected todenervation atrophy, would be smaller. 54,55How - Fig. 9.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 95FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREever, this was not the case presumably because de-nervation of the CAL is also accompanied bydenervation of the ipsilateral CAD and thereforearytenoid cartilage medialization with a xed thy-roid cartilage occurs resulting in an increase inwidth of the CAL. This increase echogenicity has ahigh predictability for laryngeal collapse during ex-ercise. Indeed, when the specicity and sensitivityof the detection of increased echogenicity on predict-ing some degree of laryngeal collapse ranged from90-95% and 95-98%, respectively. 54,55 The reason for the increased echogenicity of the CAL muscle in horses affected with RLN was re-cently evaluated by Chalmers et al, 2016. 121In this paper, the authors correlate the histopatholog-ical ndings to the ultrasonographic appearance of28 horses that were subjected to experimental tran-section of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve. Twoimportant ndings were reported in this study.The rst clinically relevant nding was that theincrease in echogenicity did not occur until 4 weeksafter transection and this nding was only mini-mally apparent. For a nonimagist it may be morereasonable to assume that detection of RLN by la-ryngeal ultrasound will not be evident until closer to8 weeks postdenervation. What is the relevance forthis? If increased echogenicity is detected, then thedenervation is probably at least 4 weeks in duration.Therefore, if one is exploring if an RLN could havebeen caused by a missed jugular vein injection orcervical surgery within 4 weeks, then laryngeal ul-trasound indicating increased echogenicity would beevidence of pre-existing RLN. The other impor-tance of Chalmers's paper is the explanation for theincreased echogenicity. It is rst due to reductionin muscle ber diameter (increasing the number ofacoustic barriers i.e., beam-angle deflection) and atan increase in collagen content per unit area asdescribed in other species. 31,122,123At least over a 28-week period, increase of fat content in the CAD muscle is minimal in horses.31 Esophageal ultrasound more recently gives one the ability to directly evaluate the muscle responsi-ble for the decit in laryngeal abduction and laryn-geal collapse during exercise-the CAD muscle.This modality was rst used in a research coopera-tion on the use of functional electrical stimulation inthe equine upper and lower airways (University ofGuelph, University of Liverpool, Royal VeterinaryCollege, Maison-Alfort, Hackensack UniversityMedical Center, and Cornell University). In an ex-periment of acute denervation of the hemilarynx,Chalmers et al, 2016 was able to also correlate in-creased echogenicity of the denervated CAD com-pared with the control side. 121It is well known that denervation reduced muscle mass on a cross- sectional area and this is associated with a loss offorce-generating capacity. 124-130As expected, ex - perimentally denervated laryngeal muscle de-creased muscle volume. 31,131The investigators in the above collaboration looked at a way to measureCAD muscle volume after 12 weeks of acute dener- vation, rst using computed tomography131and were able to measure a 30-40% decrease in volume in the ipsilateral denervated CAD. However,standing CT was not readily available in NorthAmerica (unlike in the UK) and laryngeal ultra-sound was a more practical test. The ultra-sound (TEU), the correlation between ex- vivo muscle volume measurements and those mea- sured by CT volumetric reconstruction proved to bevery close (P /H11021.0001, R 2/H110050.76).132Ex-vivo mus - cle volume measurements also signicantly corre-lated with mid-body thickness of CAD measuredusing CAD, albeit a lower correlation(P/H11005.002; R 2/H110050.44).132 However, the experimental data needed to be cor- related with measurement in naturally-occurringRLN. From clinical experience we know thathorses with naturally occurring RLN also have vary-ing degrees of atrophy. Using a clinical populationof 90 horses presented for upper airway evaluationat Cornell University with both dynamic endoscopyand TEU, a ratio of left-over-right thickness wasreported to account for breed and size differences.No signicant difference was noted in resting laryn-geal Grade 1 (0.99 /H110060.14; P/H11021.0001) and in horses with laryngeal Grade A abduction duringexercise, 0.98 /H110060.12; P/H11021.0001). 132However, horses with exercising Grade B and C had signi- cant lower ratio (0.81 /H110060.13) mid-body of the CAD muscle issufcient to result in vocal and arytenoid collapse.When using the TEU on the caudal aspect of theCAD (i.e., the lateral compartment), a /H1101110% atro- phy is associated with some degree of laryngeal col-lapse. Cornell is using TEU as a diagnostic test tohelp decide which patients with laryngeal Grade I orII or III and with some degree of laryngeal collapseshould be treated with laryngoplasty vs ventriculo-cordectomy alone. CT As described above, CT is quite useful in assessmentof the volume of the CAD muscle and has beendescribed above. 131The incursion of the paranasal sinus into the airways is best dened and character- ized by CT exam.110,133CT image acquisition can be performed with the horse standing or under gen- eral anesthesia. Temporohyoid osteoarthopathy - pression of the vestibularcochlear and facial nervesand under some stress fractures of the petrous tem-poral bone. 32,135-137It was originally believed to be secondary to otitis media/interna,135,137but is now 96 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREpredominantly associated with a degenerative pro-cess. 138,139The purpose of the CT exam is to con - rm disease of the temporohyoid articulation, anddetermine whether there is fusion of the temporohy-oid articulation that poses a risk of petrous temporalbone fracture, which may be fatal. 135,140The pres - ence or absence of otitis can also be determined.From a surgical point of view, the CT exam conrmedwhether the ankyloses is unilateral or bilateral, whichwould warrant consideration for bilateral surgery.Finally, it guides the surgery by characterizing theextent of the enlargement, 138,140presence or absence of fracture in the squamous part of the temporal bone (which would emphasize delicate surgical manipula-tion), and denes the articulation of the stylohyoid andthe ceratohyoid bone, which guides the surgicaldisarticulation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging The normal anatomy of the equine head has alsobeen dened using MRI. Therefore, incursion ofparanasal, dental, and para-airway structures intothe upper airway can be established most accuratelyon MRI. 141Kaminsky et al, 2016 recently com - pared the value of CT imaging to 3.0T MRI imagingof the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinus. 142 As expected, CT exam gave a better denition of thecortical bone whereas MRI gave better characteriza-tion of the soft tissue. 142When deciding which mo - dality to use, the clinician should consider the targettype of tissue to image, the longer acquisition time ofthe MRI, and the need for general anesthesia. There is much less information on the value of MRI for assessment of the equine larynx. Garrettet al, 2009 reported on the ability to really dene thelaryngeal cartilage abnormality in horses with fourth branchial arch defect. 143They were able to show the multiple abnormalities seen with this disease which has an important effect on the po-tential treatment. Indeed, abnormalities of thethyroid lamina, and lack of cricothyroid articula-tion, and abnormalities to the muscles of the cra-nial esophageal sphincter were known, but theextent of the deviation of the cricoid cartilage hasa critical effect on the potential surgical options.An important nding that was also seen on ultra-sound exam in this study was that the CAL muscleseems to be normal. High-Denition Robotic CT Systems An emerging diagnostic modality that offers greatpromise in standing imaging of the structures of theequine upper airways is high-denition robotic CTsystems. It is claimed to allow sub-millimeter-res-olution images allowing 3-D volumetric imaging.The author will share experiences with this mo-dality at the following link http://equine4ddi.com/(Fig. 11). 3. DDSP Etiopathogenesis There are multiple etiopathogeneses to this condi- tion. The evidence-based data listed below are re-producible models of this disease: 1. Desensitization of the pharyngeal branch of the vagus 25,144 2. Bilateral resection of the thyrohyoideus muscle145 Fig. 11. Robotic acquisition of a 6-year-old Quarter Horse head region for assessment of THO. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 97FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE3. Bilateral desensitization of the hypoglossal nerves at the level of the ceratohyoid bones146 The rst model introduced by Holcombe et al, 1999hypothesized that DDSP was secondary to a dys-function of the palatinus and palatopharyngeusmuscle. 144The model did reproduce DDSP at rest and during exercise and therefore was a more severe form of palate displacement than most naturally-occurring cases. However, this model also resultedin dysphagia, which is not a feature of iDDSP.In this model the cause of DDSP is a neuromusculardysfunction of the nasopharynx. In a follow-upstudy, glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal at pouch did notresult in DDSP. 144The next two models were able to recreate iDDSP and only during exer- cise.145,146These latter two models of DDSP sug - gested that factors other than the intrinsicneuromuscular structures of the nasopharynxwere implicated in iDDSP namely the thyrohyoi-deus muscle and/or one or more of the followingmuscles: genioglossus, styloglossus, geniohyo-deus, and hyoglossus. More recent observationssupported that early muscle fatigue may be at theroot cause of some iDDSP. 147The current work - ing hypothesis is that cervical descent of the lar-ynx is the underlying cause of iDDSP. Strapmuscle resection and laryngeal tie-forward seemsto caudal descent of thelarynx. The non-evidence-based data are centered on ob- servation of intermittent or persistent DDSP asso-ciated with soft as a cause for DDSP are anecdotal, yetfrequently observed. However, the mechanism bywhich they are associated with displacement wasthought to be structural: interfering with laryngo-palatal seals. The author has observed recentlythat sensory input may play a role because blockingthe sensory afferent results in near-immediate res-olution of the palate displacement on endoscopy. In summary, at the level of the nasopharynx, neu- romuscular decits, sensory abnormalities, andstructures that interfere with the laryngopalatalseal represent the intrinsic pathway to DDSP.Extrinsic pathway seems to be tied to early fatigueof the external musculature that controls the posi-tion of the larynx. Specic Diagnosis Physiologically, we know that DDSP results in amarked airway obstruction during exhalation. 25,151 Therefore, in horses working at high velocity, per-formance impairment occurs quickly after the occur-rence of palate displacement which is referred to as\"choking down\" or \"hitting a wall\" by trainers and/orriders. Although 20-30% of horses with DDSPmake no abnormal upper respiratory sounds (i.e., silent displacers) as described earlier, the majorityhave abnormal sounds. 8,9,14,152Historical reports of a \"gurgling noise\" are not pathognomonic of iD- DSP but are a useful clue as to the potential differ-ential diagnosis. Additional history to inquireabout is whether billowing of cheeks has been ob-served. This observation is because the soft palateis displaced dorsal to the epiglottic cartilage airflow,during exhalation, is diverted through the mouthcausing fluttering of the cheeks. This is rarely partof the history volunteered by the trainers/riders soshould be inquired about from them. Although dynamic endoscopic exam is the most helpful diagnostic aid, an external physical examshould focus on ruling out other causes of airwayobstruction and the presence of infection of the up-per airways, which could affect the neuromuscularcontrol of the nasopharynx as introduced by Hol-combe et al, 1998. 144In parallel, the observation of the presence and nature of nasal discharge and size of intermandibular lymph nodes should be deter-mined; signicant inflammation of the airwaywould dictate guttural pouch Externalsymmetry of the nasal cavity and sinus would helpidentify or suspect obstruction of the nasal passage. In practice, most equine practitioners are asked to diagnose DDSP without the availability of OGE orHSTE. In those cases, the diagnosis must be basedon the history and a resting exam, preferably imme-diately after exercise. This is far less accurate andassociated with a signicant high level of false-positive or -negative diagnosis. 3,7,8,40The focus of the exam with the horse standing is to identify intrinsic signs of nasopharyngeal abnormalities.Loosely \"non-evidence-based\" indicators are listedbelow: There is a signicant association in epiglottic cartilage changes and the occurrence ofDDSP. 48,102Look for appearance of epiglottis Grade II (thinner than the typical structure, of adequate length, and mildly flaccid with curlededges and no obvious vasculature on the dorsalaspect) or more marked flaccidity and loss ofconcavity of the caudal half of the soft palate An endoscopic evaluation of the guttural pouch is indicated if signicant upper airway in-flammation/infection is present especially ifdysphagia is present. Look for enlargedlymph nodes near the pharyngeal branch ofthe vagus 25 If the horse is still displaced while hyperneic, the cheeks billowing as air exits the oral cavityshould be observed and a gurgling or snoringsound may be heard. If these signs are ob-served during examination, an immediate en-doscopic exam should identify the soft palatedorsal to the epiglottic cartilage Presence of bruising on the dorsal aspect of the nasopharynx 98 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREIf not displaced at the time of exam, introduc- ing the endoscope in the proximal aspect of thetrachea and retracting it induces displacement(both in normal or horses with naturally occur-ring DDSP). This allows one to look for anysigns of ulceration or redness on the caudaledge of the soft palate One should also judge whether the horse seems to realize that it has displaced (makesan effort to replace its soft palate) and whethermore than two swallows is needed to correctthe displacement The presence or absence of subepiglottic masses/cysts or palatal cysts must also beascertained The subepiglottic region should be observed; this may necessitate the use of laryngeal for-ceps to elevate the epiglottic cartilage DDSP may be caused by or associated with ary-epiglottic entrapment. Therefore, thisabnormality must be ruled in or necessitate oral endoscopy (standing orunder general anesthesia) DDSP may be caused by tracheal aspiration (i.e., secondary to laryngoplasty). Here thetreatment is to reverse the aspiration and notseek specic DDSP treatment Oral examination could be needed to identify palatal cysts, ari-epiglottic (AE) entrapment How Accurate Is Diagnosis Performed at Rest?Eighty percent of horses with intermittent DDSP ontreadmill do not have abnormality on resting endos-copy. 40This is because DDSP is a dynamic condi - tion that occurs during exercise. Furthermore, theuse of a characteristic history and ndings of restingendoscopy alone resulted in a 35% misdiagnosis rateof palatal dysfunction compared with diagnosis ob-tained from treadmill endoscopy. 7 ImagingAlthough DDSP can be observed by radiography,this procedure is of limited value at this time. If airis present in the mouth, the thickness of the softpalate can be seen and it can be helpful in identify-ing palatal and sub-epiglottic cysts. Air in the oro-pharynx is considered abnormal by the author.There is some evidence 94,153that position of the larynx and hyoid apparatus might be related to theoccurrence of DDSP and therefore assessment ofthese structures might become useful in the futurethrough radiography. Currently, detecting a moreventral position of the basihyoid bone on ultrasonog-raphy 153has a low positive predictive value (36%) of iDDSP during exercise. However, it has a high negative predictive value (89%). This test is notready for clinical application yet given that the dif-ferences in position of the basihyoid bone is /H110113m m and this is clearly affected by the pressure on theultrasound probe. Its value is more in researchapplication on the position of the larynx and hyoid apparatus on the pathophysiology of iDDSP. Exercise Examination Dynamic endoscopy by OGE or HSTE is the gold standard. Sound analysis is no longer of much clin-ical importance now that the availability of OGE hasproliferated throughout the world. The diagnosisof DDSP is obvious when we observe the soft pal-ate positioned dorsal to the epiglottic cartilage foreight or more breaths during strenuous exer-cise. 9,41However, horses with exercise-induced iDDSP do not necessarily displace during every exercise test nor at every race. The DDSP diag-nosis rate is lower with OGE exam if the exerciseintensity is not as strenuous as treadmill testing,probably because protocols are less well estab-lished. 154,155These data are improving as the need for maximal speed is emphasized during overground exam.cThis means that a negative diagnosis of DDSP during videoendoscopy during exercise may not rule out this diagnosis. There-fore, during high-intensity exercise, we should rec-ognize prodromal signs of DDSP. Those that areindicative of palatal instability are billowing of thesoft palate (evidence of palatal instability), appear-ance of flaccidity of the epiglottic cartilage, and re-traction of the larynx. 3,4,156 4. Treatment Management After Initial Diagnosis Allen et al, 2011 reported on the rst systemic re- view of the numerous treatments of iDDSP.157 Because of the heterogenicity of the prior publishedpapers on the various treatments, the lack of appro-priate controls (including the status of disease incontrol), they were not able to determine which pro-cedure is the most appropriate in management ofthis condition. There are published reports that suggest that nonsurgical treatments (rest and the use of tongue-tie) of this condition are associated with a successrate comparable to surgery (in general, not all pro-cedures evaluated) and therefore medical treatmentshould be considered seriously. 158-160Only two pa - pers have looked at the effect of the tongue-tie onupper airway mechanics in horses during exercise.One study was performed in normal horses 161while the other was in normal horses after having per- formed a strap muscle resection.162It was shown that it had no negative or positive effect during exercise. With the goal to enhance the effective-ness of the tongue-tie, various bits have been pro-posed namely the \"w\" bit and the Serena Song bit. 163 Consistent with the principle of the laryngeal tie-forward surgery, an external device (see Conflict ofInterest Disclosure) that places the larynx forwardand dorsally J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREOther changes in tack of horses are commonly described in the management of palatal instabilityor iDDSP, usually with other changes (rest or in-crease training to improve tness). 160The use of the gure-eight nose band or dropped noseband is claimed to be effective in preventing air into theoropharynx and it is logical that this would predis-pose the soft palate to instability if the air is main-tained at that location. There are no data todemonstrate whether this happens and why airwould remain there after a swallow which is reason-ably frequent during exercise. Other anecdotaltack changes suggested for managing DDSP arethose that decrease head flexion. A bitless bridlehas been suggested for sport horses. Horses with pharyngeal inflammation have been recommended to be treated rst with systemic, andperhaps topical, anti-inflammatory agents unless aprior equine protozoal made. rela-tionship between the occurrences of DDSP andpharyngitis. Holcombe et al, 1999 has shown that damage of the pharyngeal branch of the vagusnerve as it traverses the medial wall of the gut-tural pouch can result in DDSP; inflammation isthought to be the most common cause of this pha-ryngeal nerve dysfunction. 144Two different anti- inflammatory protocols that are used as treatment are below: 1. Dexamethasone (25-30 mg by mouth [PO] or IV SID for 3 days, 20 mg PO or IV SID for 3days, 10 mg PO or IV SID for 3 days, and 10mg PO or IV EOD for three treatments), and 2. Prednisolone (300 mg PO twice a day [BID] for 2 weeks, 300 mg PO SID for 2 weeks, and 300mg PO EOD for 2 weeks). The dexametha-sone protocol is more potent Anecdotally, structural abnormalities of the larynx and nasopharynx andpredisposes horses to DDSP. When present, thetreatment should those lesions. Cysts,which are excised using as granulomasand epiglottitis are more difcult to address. How-ever, if there is not a prolonged history of medicaltreatment, the latter should be performed rst.The standard treatment for horses with acute orsub-acute epiglottitis is 10-21 days of antimicrobi-als (usually trimethoprim-sulfadiazine, SID) anti-inflammatory (phe-nylbutazone, PO, BID for for 3-5 days). Although controversial, topicalnasopharyngeal anti-inflammatory preparations arefrequently used in the author's practice. The prep-aration we use is a throat spray at 20 cc BID (madeup of 250 mL glycerin, 250 mL dimethyl mg/mL]), or a steroid inhaler (be-clomethasone) has been used by others. a Two-year-old horses with DDSP may have an \"im- mature nasopharynx,\" so owners should considerwaiting a year before pursuing any surgical treat-ment. Finally, an unt horse's tness level shouldbe raised before considering any surgical treatment. Surgical Treatment There are many surgical treatments for this condi-tion whose etiopathogenesis is clearly not fully un-derstood and/or has different pathogenesis. Withthe absence of a valid meta-analysis to identify thebest treatment, the following represent the ap-proach used by the author. Horses diagnosed withiDDSP after two or more races in which the medical/tack modication has failed to correct the problem,are candidates for surgical treatment. In sporthorses, DDSP is far less common, the outcome moresubjective, and surgical results reported less often. Quinlan introduced and popularized the rst sur- gical treatment staphylectomy. 165This treatment is still used (but not recommended by the author for iDDSP) as part of a composite treatment in generalin association with strap muscles resection. 63-65 Aside from the staphylectomy, there are three cate-gories of surgical treatments: 1. Those that target correcting the intrinsic nasopharyngeal structures (cyst/granulomaremoval) 2. Those that seek to increase palatal stiffness (by thermal palatoplasty by cautery, 154,166-168 agents,171-173and tension palatoplasty by suturing174) 3. Those targeting the position of the larynx and hyoid bone, such as strap muscle resec- tion63,64,175-178and laryngeal tie-forward.94,154,177 The primary benet of other surgery of the intrin- sic structure of the nasopharynx relevant to the softpalate is related to removal of granulomas, cysts,and abnormal subepiglottic tissue. One should beaware that the subepiglottic tissue is quite sensitiveto surgical trauma (laser, blade, or scissors), and sothe veterinary surgeon should be cautious aboutthese areas, especially during repeated surgery.Staphylectomy is currently only performed for occa-sional resection of soft palate cysts, rarely for softpalate ulcer, or as a part of a composite treatmentfor persistent DDSP after a laryngeal tie-forwardhas been performed. 150 The rationale for targeting a procedure that in- creases palatal stiffness is being questioned giventhe results in three studies. In one study usinginjection of a sclerosing agent in the soft palate, theauthors did not nd evidence of sustained change instiffness or morphology of the soft palate at up to 6 100 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREmonths post injection.178In another study, some histological evidence of brosis (168 days post injec-tion) was seen which might increase rigidity. 173 In the third study,179brosis was also induced with a diode laser (15 watts ; 1 s on, 1 s off) but the biomechanical property was not changed at 45 days.Therefore, although we can induce some brosis ofthe soft palate, its biomechanical value may be lim-ited if at all present. Furthermore, there is achance that inducing brosis would also damage thepalatinus muscle or interfere with its function andfor those reasons, these treatments are no longervery popular. The author's view on this surgicalgoal is that if increasing stiffness of the soft palatecould be performed reliably and for a prolonged pe-riod of time, it would likely reduce the fluttering ofthe caudal free edge of the soft palate and thusreduce abnormal upper respiratory noise associatedwith this flutters. Whether it would reduce theairway obstruction is far less likely. Strap muscle resections (bilateral partial steno- thyroidectomy) with a reported success rate of 58-70% remains one of the most popular treatments ofthis condition. With the horse in dorsal recum-bency under short-acting or other form of generalanesthesia, a skin incision (5-7 cm in length) ismade centered on the ventral aspect of the cricoidcartilage on the midline. After incising the subcu-taneous tissue, the muscles are di-vided using curved scissors. With nger dissectionon the lateral aspect of the cricoid cartilage, the right sternohyoideus muscle is identied tendinous The tendon is transected 1-2 cmcaudal to thyroid cartilage to avoid trauma to thecricothyroid muscle which tenses the vocal cord orcaudal laryngeal artery. A 3-cm section of each ster-nothyroideus muscle/tendon is then removed. Thisprevents re-attachment of the cut end of the muscle onthe cricoid or thyroid cartilage (Fig. 12). Laryngeal tie-forward procedure is also per- formed with the horse under general anesthesia indorsal recumbency. As part of this procedure,the partial stenothyroidectomy is performed asdescribed above and the larynx is elevated dor-sally and rostrally using sutures placed from thethyroid cartilage to the basihyoid bone Becausethe weak part of this procedure is anchoring thesutures to the thyroid cartilage, a couple of mod-ications have been described: 1. Four passes of sutures in the thyroid cartilage (Fig. 12) 2. The use of surgical buttons to buttress the thyroid cartilage. 180In addition, various su - tures pattern around the basihyoid bone havebeen described. 181Mechanically, the ofthe basihyoid bone 94,114,177There is far less information on the treatment of horses with persistent DDSP.148,150,182,183No evi - dence-based study is present here to guide the clini-cians as to how to manage these cases. In ourexperience, if there is any tracheal aspiration of feedmaterial, this should be resolved rst. Any painfulcondition that has epiglottic ulceration or chondritismust also be resolved. Then the surgical steps inthe order suggested by Ortved et al, 2010 should beused. 150Redundant ari-epiglottic tissue is rst re - moved, followed by a laryngeal tie-forward and, ifneeded, laser staphylectomy is performed. Nasopharyngeal Collapse Etiopathogenesis The etiology of nasopharynx collapse (NPC) is largely unknown. Males are more affected than females.184 It should be pointed out that some nasopharyngealcollapse can have a different degree of severity (onlyroof, unstable palate, entire nasopharynx) and canalso be associated with dysphagia. Immaturity andsystemic disease such as hyperkalemic periodic paral-ysis (HYPP) and vitamin E and selenium deciencyhave been reported to affect the neuromuscular controland function of the upper airway and can be associatedwith dysphagia (predominantly Vitamin E, SEdeciency). 185,186 Most commonly, nasopharyngeal collapse is pre- sented as a source of upper airway noise and isdiscovered during dynamic endoscopy during exer-cise. We do know that the stylopharyngeus muscleis the main dilator of the roof of the nasopharynx. 187 This muscle is activated during inhalation and hastonic activity that increases with an increase in ex-ercise intensity. 188Experimental data from Mich - igan State187showed that collapse of the roof of the nasopharynx can be reproduced by desensitization Fig. 12. A previous strap muscle resection was performed in thishorse and the proximal end of the strap muscle has reattached onthe cricoid cartilage, likely invalidating glossopharyngeal nerves at the level of theguttural pouches. Therefore, upper airway inflam-mation of those efferent nerves to the dilators of thenasopharynx can result in NPC and thereby therationale of using anti-inflammatory medications inthe management of this condition. It is also known that the vertical diameter of the nasopharynx is affected by neck position. 100This is believed to be a geometrical consequence of bending of the upper respiratory tract, which increases resis-tance. 14,100In addition, Cehak et al, 2010 reported that not only was the diameter reduced with head flexion but also the shape of the nasopharynxchanges from round to oval, suggesting that it in-creases the compliance of its wall. 100Mechanical devices that change the head position during exer- cise could then be logical to manage this condition. Another hypothesis is that some horses with dor- sal collapse of the nasopharynx have sub-clinicalguttural pouch tympany and therefore may be im-proved with surgical treatment of this condition. 28 Certainly, unilateral collapse of the roof of the na-sopharynx is a strong indication of guttural pouchdisease and the need for endoscopy of those struc-tures. Usually unilateral collapse of the roof of thenasopharynx is with guttural pouch em-pyema. Bilateral sub-clinical tym-pany being a congenital oran acquired stricture or stenosis of the \"valve\" pouch. guttural pouch pressure with thenasopharyngeal pressures. Inspiratory pressure is thought to activate the driving receptors for the increase in muscular ac-tivity during exercise. The afferent loop to thesepressure receptors may therefore also be part ofthe clinical disease in horses where recruitment ofthe nasopharyngeal dilators is dysfunctional.Indeed, in \"normal\" experimental horses, desenti-zation of the nasopharynx with local anesthesiaresults in nasopharyngeal collapse. 189It is felt that the upper respiratory sensory receptors are located in a submucosal area and receive afferentinnervation from the internal branch of the cra-nial laryngeal, or the vagus, or the trigeminalnerves depending on where they are located in theupper airways. 25,190-192Therefore, inflamma - tory condition of the upper airway may interferewith either or both the sensory or motor innerva-tion to the upper airways, 188,189and would be the justication for the anti-inflammatory treatmentsin the management of this condition. Olderhorses with NPC have been reported to have apoor prognosis. 193Perhaps this is because the inflammatory cause of NPC would be less frequent in older horses and more signicant structuraldamage would be present. Unilateral nasopharyngeal collapse is, in the au- thor's experience, a xed obstruction associated withstylohyoid bone fracture and or infection. 31,134,140,194 The cause of these fractures is largely unknown.We have observed some fracture associated with \"palatal injection.\" These \"paralaryngeal injections\" that do not re-ally reach the soft palate. The injections can, how-ever, reach an area between the thyrohyoid boneand the stylohyoid bone and lead to infection. In-fection at that area could result in local oropharyn-geal or nasopharyngeal swelling depending on itslocation. This has resulted in some horses as alarge (i.e., egg size) bulge compressing the ipsilat-eral lateral wall of the nasopharynx. Fracture ofthe stylohyoid or ceratohyoid bone is associated witha similar swelling but is distinguished by the detec-tion of submucosal hemorrhage at the apex of theswelling on endoscopy. Fractures of the stylohyoidand ceratohyoid bones are rare. They have beenassociated with THO. 31,134,140The author believes that the laryngeal tie-forward procedure may pre- dispose a very small number of horses to stylohyoidbone fracture. Bilateral nasopharyngeal wall collapse causes an abnormal upper respiratory noise and airway ob-struction during exercise. It more commonly pres-ents as an entire lateral wall collapse and is a verydebilitating disease in terms of severity of the air-way obstruction. This is likely a result of afferentor efferent neuromuscular dysfunction as describedabove. However, in three racehorses, it was sec-ondary to a marked increase in nasal resistance.A second form of bilateral dynamic lateral wall col-lapse usually presents as a horse with an abnormalupper airway noise with a very questionable airwayobstruction. On endoscopy, a longitudinal leadingedge of the nasopharynx at the level of the areaimmediately dorsal to the lateral wall attachment ofthe soft palate collapse toward the midline. Thecause of this obstruction is unknown. Management In neonatal foals, nasopharyngeal collapse and dys-phagia is often, (but not always), transient within afew weeks, and treatments usually consist of feedingfrom a pan and supportive medical therapy tailoredto the foal's need (antibiotics, IV fluids, etc.). 57 To manage horses where the cause or the exacer- bation of the NPC is due to head flexion, whichcontributes to a decreased dorsoventral diameter ofthe nasopharynx, a change in tack should be consid-ered. The change in head flexion must of course beconsistent with the required horse's head positionduring working activity. For example, the \"rollkur\" is a training method used in dressage competitionthat may or may not be reduced. The effect of headposition on dorsal nasopharyngeal diameter is con-sistent with the prevalence of nasopharyngeal insta-bility and collapse seen in sport horses duringexercise where head flexion is much greater thanracehorses. 13,14This is a key reason where OGE is preferable to HSTE in sport. 102 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREIn terms of medical management, if upper airway inflammation is present that is signicant enough toaffect the afferent or efferent neural innervation,anti-inflammatory treatment protocols are logical.It should be emphasized that there are no doubleblind or even case-control data available to guide theclinician. We have used empirically one of threeanti-inflammatory protocols: 1. Dexamethasone (30 mg PO or IV SID for 3 days, 20 mg PO or IV SID for 3 days, 10 mg POor IV SID for 3 days, and 10 mg PO or IV EODfor three treatments) 2. Prednisolone (300 mg PO BID for 2 weeks, 300 mg PO SID for 2 weeks, and 300 mg PO EODfor 2 weeks; Note the dexamethasone protocolis more potent) puffers such as fluticasone mi- crogram (Flovent): 4-5 puffs of the metereddose inhaler BID for 10 days then SID or EOD for 3 weeks depending on severity. (Notethat only the puffer in the metered dose in-haler is suitable; not the powder diskinhaler b) Horses that are HYPP positive should respond to acetazolamide therapy.185,186No case control data are available to guide the prognosis. Horses with dorsal nasopharyngeal collapse may respond to fenestration of the guttural fenestration (a technique introduced by Woodie,Rood and Riddle, KY) may be considered and is theauthor's preference because it is simple and does notoffer the possibility of brosis and stenosis of theguttural pouch opening or the early course of theauditory tube. In horses with severe nasopharyngeal collapse, usually accompanied with iDDSP, many have beentreated with laryngeal tie-forward and alar fold re-section. This is an empirical treatment and has notbeen objectively evaluated through a case-controlanalysis. In addition, the author has treated threeseverely affected Thoroughbred racehorses in whichwe diagnosed an abnormally high nasal resistance.The treatment consisted of standing nasal septumresection and bilateral alar fold resection using amodication of previously described techniques un-der general anesthesia. 195,196Two horses received an additional laryngeal tie-forward. All three re- turned to racing and two won their rst start al-though none of them were high-level racehorses. Laryngeal Collapse There are multiple forms of laryngeal collapse andclinicians should be aware that although RLN is themost common cause, it is not the only cause of col-lapse of the hemilarynx. Bilateral collapse of thearytenoid cartilages should be suggestive of disease Etiopathogenesis laryngeal neuropathy paralysis or idiopathic laryn-geal hemiplegia/hemiparesis) 6is the most common cause of left laryngeal collapse during exercise and is associated with decreased or absent abduction ofthe left arytenoid at rest. The disease is character-ized histologically (predominantly on the left side)as a progressive loss of myelinated bers, with ax-onal loss, and with regenerating axons in distalaspect of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. 197-201The primary lesion seems to be axonal in nature with secondary myelin loss although the reverse may betrue. The lesions to a much milder degree are alsoseen in the right side 198,199,201At this time RLN in horses is classied as a distal axonopathy and is a bilateral mononeuropathy limited to the recurrentlaryngeal nerves. 201 The cause of the disease is largely unknown. As- sociation with a horse's height (withers height) and agenetic basis on increased prevalence of the diseasehave been numerous. 202-206Gradual nerve elonga - tion has been associated with ischemic damage to thenerve. 207,208Trying to tease the purely height effect from a separate yet associated genetic effect in the prevalence of RLN has been investigated by case-based epidemiological studies 202,203,209-211and by genomic-wide association.204,205,212Poncet et al, 1989 reported on the 59 \"related\" offsprings of a French riding stallion conrmed to have RLN by post-mortem exam. The offspring had a prevalence ofnearly 50% RLN compared with 10% in the 50 controlswith the status of disease and control all determinedby resting endoscopy. 203The affected horses were taller than unaffected horses as was reported by oth- ers.209The heritability of RLN in horses in similar studies has been estimated ranging from 0.2 to 0.6.202,213,214 Dupuis et al, 2011 identied two genome-wide loci in warmbloods on chromosome 21 and 31 but was aprotective halotype in controls. 205In a population of Thoroughbreds, Boyko et al, 2014 did a genome- wide association study GWAS in 282 RLN-positivevs 268 RLN-negative horses using the resting endos-copy phenotype. 204They found a strong genetic correlation between the and RLN (LCORL/NCAPG locus on ECA3). previously identied. 212If there is not a modier loci altering the prevalence of RLN, the studies to date suggest that it may be difcult bybreeding restriction to restrict the prevalence ofRLN without reducing the height of unaffectedhorses. Another concern is that according to some authors' histopathological analysis, all Thorough-breds are affected with at least make likely natu- rally occurring RLN, any trauma or diseases affect-ing the vagus or the recurrent laryngeal nerve canresult in the same condition. Indeed, perivascularinjection, esophageal surgery, guttural pouch myco-sis, 27,216and planned surgical transection of the re - current laryngeal nerve217can all result in RLN. Cervical trauma to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and/or vagus is often associated with sympatheticnerve damage because of the close approximation ofthe sympathetic trunk to those structures. Signs ofHorner's syndrome may be helpful in identifying thecause of RLN in a given horse. In summary, naturally occurring or traumatic or inflammatory RLN can result in resting endoscopicipsilateral arytenoid cartilage movement asymme-try and asynchrony as well as various degrees ofarytenoid cartilage and vocal cord collapse duringexercise. Diagnosis The various clinical (abnormal upper respiratorynoise and/or poor performance), endoscopic (gener-ally left vocal cord/arytenoid failure of full abductionor collapse as seen in Table 1) have been describedearlier. The flow dynamic consequence of a de-creased cross-sectional area of the left hemilarynxand a change in pressure prole in the nasopharynxlead to predisposition for right vocal cord and rightary-epiglottic fold collapse, which is often seen dur-ing dynamic endoscopy. 5Red-flag endoscopic fea - tures to clinician anothercause of the laryngeal collapse are listed below: 1. Bilateral arytenoid and/or vocal cord collapse (Fig. 13B) 85,215,2182. Enlargement of one or more of the arytenoid cartilage68,118,219,220 3. Subluxation or medial deviation of one or both medial aspects of the corniculate pro-cesses (Fig. 13 A and C) with or withoutmedial folding of the lateral borders of theepiglottic cartilage 98,221 The hallmark of RLN is various degrees of ipsilat-eral atrophy of intrinsic laryngeal muscle bers thatresult in a change in muscle volume. This changein CAD volume may be detectable on digital palpa-tion of the larynx, and quantied using esophagealultrasound or CT exam. This atrophy of the muscleber results in increased echogenicity of CAL andCAD detectable on laryngeal ultrasound. Thesemuscle changes are the basis of imaging-diagnosismodalities to identify RLN. 55,131,222 To further determine the level of neuropathy, var- ious neurodiagnostic tests have been used in thepast targeting determination of nerve conduc-tion. 223,224The thoraco-laryngeal reflex (i.e., slap test)225response was introduced by Cook and Thal - hammer, 1992 as a possible test to identify slowernerve conduction in horses with RLN. 226This test as described does not measure true nerve conduction but rather latency, which may be affected by manyfactors, so it is not a simple and reliable test. 224 This test is not recommended as a diagnostic orresearch tool. True measurement of recurrent la-ryngeal nerve conduction has been reported 227and may become an accurate and practical test in the future although it is a primary research tool at thistime. Fig. 13.

There are no mechanical advantages in terms of airway patency to perform a ventriculectomy 230 2. Ventriculocordectomy (VC) improves airway mechanics although more so with bilateralprocedures 16,231 3. Both ventriculectomy and ventriculocordectomy reduce abnormal upper respiratory noise, butventriculocordectomy is more effective 16 These results in an experimental populationare broadly supported in naturally occurringdisease. 10,232-234 In a clinical population unilateral or bilateral la- ser-assisted VC or ipsilateral VC and right ventri-culectomy are the preferred treatment for use insport and draft horses where abnormal respiratorynoise is the main complaint. 235Ventriculectomy and/or ventriculo-cordectomy techniques are com-monly combined with laryngoplasty. 71,233,236-240 Laryngoplasty Since the introduction of laryngoplasty by Marks in1970, multiple modications of the techniques havebeen introduced, probably with incremental im-provement in success rates using historical controlsonly. 15,241-244What are the evidence-based data? We know that the target abduction is somewhere around 88% to improve respiratory mechanicswithin 4% of normal. 5,245In experimentally cre - ated laryngeal hemiplegia in horses, treatment bylaryngoplasty has led to the following conclusions: 1. Laryngoplasty restores airway mechanics to normal. 230,246This statement has been chal - lenged, also in experimentally created RLN, andalthough respiratory mechanics have beenmainly restored, ventilation was not. 69Given the results in clinical treatment of naturally occurring RLN, it is unlikely that this procedurerestores airway mechanics to normal. Fur-thermore it is associated with as prosthesis 15,73,75,152,183,238,241,244 2. Laryngoplasty alone reduced abnormal upper respiratory noise but not as effectively as bi-lateral ventriculocordectomy. 247In a clinical population, it is very rare that a laryngoplasty is performed without a ventriculectomy orventriculocordectomy. And it has been shownthat horses which had a laryngoplasty without aventriculectomy have been reported to be ve time more likely to have an abnormal upperrespiratory noise, thus supporting the ndingsin experimental horses. 183 3. There are no added benets in terms of airway patency of performing ventriculocordectomyunilaterally or bilaterally after a laryngo-plasty has been performed. 246The results in clinical populations do not strongly support this latter experimental conclusion. Veryfew, if any, surgeons will perform a laryngo-plasty without a ventriculectomy or ventricu-locordectomy. It is likely that this conclusionin the experimental animal was based on thesuboptimal degree of precision measured byrespiratory mechanics. Indeed, if the laryn-goplasty truly restores the airway to normal,how can the addition of ventriculocordectomymake it \"more normal?\" Nevertheless, laryngoplasty is the current gold stan- dard of treatment of horses with unilateral aryte-noid and vocal cord collapse associated with RLN.Important recent elements of this treatment thatthe author considers noteworthy are below: 1. The Dixon laryngeal Grade 1-5 (Table 2) is used in the clinical population to character-ize the postoperative degree of abductionachieved 75 2. The average location of the arytenoid cartilage within a few days of a tieback is a Grade II butis Grade III at 6 weeks postsurgery 75 3. Most of the loss in abduction after surgery occurs in the rst 6 weeks postoperatively andthe correlation between rst day scoping and6 weeks or 33 months is poor but the correla-tion between 6 weeks and 33 months isgood 183 4. Facilitated ankyloses of the cricoarytenoid joint is helpful to maintain abduction242 5. Performing a ventriculocordectomy as the step immediately prior to laryngoplasty im-proves the degree of abduction obtained 248 6. Soft palate displacement is frequently seen in horses after a laryngoplasty152,249 7. Standing laryngoplasty is the preferred method to perform this surgery because it al-lows more precise intraoperative positioningof the arytenoid cartilage 250 Partial Arytenoidectomy Arytenoidectomy is one of the oldest treatments ofRLN and arytenoid chondritis. The procedure, rstintroduced as a treatment of roaring in horses, hasevolved from the original description of a total re-moval of the arytenoid cartilage to a sub-total wherethe corniculate process and muscular process is leftin place to a partial arytenoidectomy where only themuscular process is left in place. 251What is the best procedure in terms of restoring airway patency AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 105FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREas determined by measurement of upper airway me-chanics? This question may not be relevant insome cases, aside from cases affected with arytenoidchondritis when the location and extent of the dis-ease process affecting the arytenoid cartilage influ-ence the selection of procedure. In experimentalanimals, left laryngeal hemiplegia was created inunaffected horses and a sub-total arytenoidectomywas performed. 252No signicant improvement in airway mechanics was reported indicating that thisprocedure is not recommended in the treatment ofRLN or in performance horses with arytenoid chon-dritis. It may, however, be indicated in the treat-ment of arytenoid chondritis in broodmare/ nonathletic horses. This is because this surgeryeffectively removes the infected cartilage and it isbelieved (although not tested) that this procedure isless likely to expose the horse to postoperative tra-cheal aspirations. On the contrary, the partial ar-ytenoidectomy procedure has been shown, also in anexperimental model of laryngeal hemiplegia, to im-prove airway mechanics in horses during exer-cise. 67,69This improvement was not as good as seen after laryngoplasty either using historical con- trols230,246or within the same horse submitted to the two subsequent procedures.69 In a clinical population, partial arytenoidectomy was once thought of as a salvage procedure66,253but is now recognized as an effective alternative to laryngoplasty.68,69,236,254Recent clinical studies indicate that in horses that have raced before, re-turn to racing is approximately 80%, perhaps higherthan after laryngoplasty, which is reported to beapproximately 70%. Both partial arytenoidectomyand laryngoplasty procedures properly result inshorter racing careers when compared withpeers, 216,217although that result has been chal - lenged recently.255The level of performance (using earning as a surrogate for airway patency) after partial arytenoidectomy seems to be inferior to thatof racehorses with laryngoplasty, 236indicating the superiority of the latter procedure when successful(i.e., successful tieback is better than a successfulpartial arytenoidectomy). In summary, the data suggest that laryngoplasty yields superior results in terms of improving airwaypatency, although results after a partial arytenoid-ectomy seem to be more uniform. The degree ofrestoration of airway patency is of course dependenton the demand of the desired athletic endeavor of aparticular horse. Laryngeal Reinnervation Laryngeal reinnervation procedures (nerve-pedicleor nerve implantation) were rst introduced in hu-mans. 256,257At the time, the value of the reinner - vation was to prevent atrophy and provide bulk tothe reinnervated muscle. This is still considered ofvalue in reinnervation of the vocal cord. 258The nerve-pedicle, nerve implantation procedures, as well as nerve anastomosis of the rst or secondcervical nerve to the recurrent laryngeal nerve were then adapted to experimental horses in 1989.259-261 In experimental horses, the value of the nerve-musclepedicle transplant procedure was evaluated by Ful-ton et al, 1991. 262,263This group was able to show an improvement of the airway patency as assessed by determination in airway mechanics after trans-plantation of nerve-muscle pedicle(s) in the left CADmuscle of a recently denervated muscle. However,the time for this maximal effect ( /H1101152 weeks) re- mains the main negative of this procedure: thelong delay associated with reinnervation. The target clinical patient for a reinnervation is a clinically affected horse (often 1-2 years old) withlaryngeal Grade II or III where the muscle volumeof the CAD is still signicant. Is there a need fortransection of the native recurrent laryngeal nerveto avoid the blocking effect of dual innervation?These horses still have signicant arytenoid move-ment and transecting the native recurrent laryngealnerve would worsen the laryngeal collapse until re-innervation occurs. Other questions not answeredby the study in experimental animal were: Whatare the results in horses with naturally-occurringdisease? Is there a way to speed up the reinnerva-tion process? Here we are missing a double blindstudy, yet much progress has been made in answer-ing this question in great part by the work of IanFulton and colleagues in Australia. 264,265In his population, his group has not transected the native recurrent laryngeal nerve and still reported successin terms of return to racing as similar to what isseen after laryngoplasty. The hypothesis is that the transplanted nerve-pedicle reinnervated the dener- vated muscle and muscle still innervated by nativerecurrent laryngeal nerve are excluded from thisprocess. The reported successes conrm that theprocedure is applicable in horses with naturally oc-curring RLN. The main advantage of the laryngeal reinnerva- tion technique is its lower morbidity once the horsehas recovered from general anesthesia. This is be-cause it provides a more physiological restoration offunction without compromising airway protectivemechanisms. The complication rate after laryn-geal reinnervation is consequently very low. How can reinnervation be improved? The au- thor currently has abandoned the nerve-pedicleprocedure in favor of a newer technique intro-duced in human laryngeal reinnervation describedby the group led by J. P. Marie in Rouen, France. 266 There is a question as to the quantity and extent ofthe reinnervation obtained from the rst/second cer-vical nerve. As a result, the abduction of the ary-tenoid cartilage might not be sufcient afterreinnervation to prevent vocal cord collapse duringexercise. Therefore, unilateral ventriculocordec-tomy with reinnervation procedures was performed. How can the speed of reinnervation be improved? Tessa Gordon and colleagues have shown that1-hour electrical stimulation at the time of injury 106 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREcan enhance the speed of motor neuron regenera-tion. 267-270This offers us the possibility of improv - ing the speed of reinnervation after laryngealreinnervation procedures in horses. At this time,the J.P. Marie technique in clinical patients is beingused and the rehabilitation process of the CAD mus-cle enhanced by electrical stimulation investigated,which is described below. Electrical Rehabilitation of the CAD Muscle Reanimation of the human larynx has been investi-gated since the early 1990s. Ira Sanders and DavidZealear were pioneers in this modality and manyothers followed their lead of electrical stimulationtreatment of humans with unilateral or bilateralvocal cord paralysis, generally using the dog or catas a model. 271-278The technique has been investi - gated in humans and although voice restoration isan important need in humans, airway patency isalso needed in many patients. 276,279-283 In horses, this is an emerging modality of reani- mation thanks to a large collaboration with col-leagues at Hackensack University Medical Center(Ira Sanders, Liancai Mu), Royal Veterinary Col-lege, University of London (Justin Perkins, and Since 2004 the grouphas investigated the use of functional electrical stim-ulation to modulate treatment of upper and lower air-way diseases. Neuroanatomy and function of therelevant laryngeal muscles were mapped. 284,285In parallel studies, stimulation of the recurrent laryngealnerve, CAD, and cricothyroid muscles in both nativeand/or denervated states were performed. 131,286-288 To improve patient selection and track the rehabilita-tion of the CAD muscles, imaging modalities as theycorrelate with CAD muscles volume and immunohis-tochemistry were performed. 56,121,131Other groups or authors have also investigated electrical stimula- tion of the larynx.289 Fabrice Rossignol and Celine Mespoulhe `s-Riviere are leading a study looking at the application of elec-trical stimulation in this laryngeal application. Thehypothesis is that electrical stimulation will enhancethe speed of recovery and the rehabilitation of the CADmuscle after reinnervation. Throughout the years the members of the collaboration and the corporatesponsor (MED-EL Medical Electronics 6020 Inns-bruck, Austria) have identied and brought aboutmultiple improvements in material and surgical tech-niques to support this rehabilitation of the reinner-vated CAD muscle. Other potential applications arein rehabilitation of upper airway muscles involved inDDSP and inducing bronchodilation.Complications of Treatment Tracheal Contamination Both arytenoidectomy and laryngoplasty surgical pro- cedures interfere with the airway's normal protectivemechanisms and have similar rates of airway contam-ination and coughing. 69On occasion, some horses suffer from an unacceptable amount of airway contam- ination after either laryngoplasty or partial arytenoid-ectomy. This is a well-recognized complication thathas been reported for many years. 71,75,290This dis - tressing complication can be a welfare issue in affectedhorses. The reported principles of treatment revolvegenerally around removing the laryngoplasty suturesand lysis of the adhesions surrounding the cricoaryte-noid joint so that the arytenoid cartilage returns to aneutral position. The latter step is especially impor- tant if a facilitated ankyloses of the cricoarytenoidjoint has been performed by one of the three tech-niques described. 240,242,243Unfortunately, no evi - dence-based data exist to guide the propermanagement of this condition. A review of the cases will be presented for man- agement of various degrees of tracheal aspirationand palate displacement. It has been reported thatDDSP is frequent after laryngoplasty 152,183and DDSP is also seen after partial arytenoidectomy. A common cause of DDSP after laryngoplasty is dueto tracheal penetration of feed material through oro-pharynx contamination or esophageal reflux. 73 This emphasized the need for a proper diagnosticinvestigation to understand the cause of the aspira-tion post laryngoplasty. This is reviewed under di-agnostic methods for dysphagia and describedabove. In terms of treatment, strategic injectionbulking is also used by the author. Persistent Complaint of Upper Airway Obstruction/Abnormal Noise After Surgical Treatment Persistent complaint of upper airway obstruction/ abnormal noise may be due to failure of abduction orcollapse of additional soft tissue. 152,247,291-293Col- lapse of the remaining parts of the vocal cord, of thecontralateral vocal cord, of the contralateral ary-epiglottic fold, DDSP can all contribute to persistentnoise and/or poor performance after a laryngoplasty.Some of this associated tissue collapse is predictablebased on flow studies given that laryngoplasty doesnot restore normal geometry to the larynx. 5Post- laryngoplasty DDSP is speculated by the author to be associated with the occurrence of tracheal pene-tration of feed material. Regardless, persistence ofnoise or airway obstruction after laryngoplasty re-quires at least a resting endoscopic exam. In addi-tion, unless the abduction is a Dixon Grade V, adynamic exam is preferred to identify all the com-ponents of the persistent upper airway noise and/orobstruction. 152,291,294The frequency of the afore - mentioned post-laryngoplasty soft tissue collapseargue for considerations to perform bilateral ven- PROCEEDINGS /H114082016 107FRANK and ary-epiglottic folds with a la-ryngoplasty procedure. There was an association between laryngoplasty and the development of EIPH and airway inflamma-tory disease in a case-cohort study. 238Both of these support the documentation of shorter racing career reported in the past.236It has been proposed that the interference with the native protective mechanism of the larynx by the laryngoplasty predispose to pulmo-nary inflammation and brosis of the pulmonary pa-renchyma. Both factors are likely to increase theoccurrence and severity of EIPH. Failure to Maintain Abduction The loss of abduction in the rst 6 weeks post laryn-goplasty has been well described by the classicalpaper of Dixon et al, 2003. 75However, there is ample evidence that a Dixon laryngeal Grade III (modest abduction) is compatible with good athleticperformance. Moderate abduction of the arytenoid6 weeks after surgery is likely to be maintained andis sufcient for racing soundness (probably the hard-est clinical test of this treatment) if the arytenoid isstable during exercise and no other soft tissue col-lapse is present. 291,292,294 This has led many investigations on various tech- niques to improve the stability of the upper airways.They can be classied under the following: 1. Increased stability of the cricoarytenoid articulation 240,242,243 2. Increasing stability of the suture-cartilage interaction244,295-299 3. Better abduction intra-operatively248,250 Laryngeal Collapse Without RLN There are many laryngeal collapses that resembleRLN prompting our human counterparts to suggestthe term \"laryngeal movement disorder.\" 300The affected horses have no evidence of RLN yet exhibit laryngeal collapse during exercise (Fig. 13, A-C).The horses in Figure 13 all had arytenoid collapseduring exercise without evidence of RLN. No ex-perimental or histopathological data was availableto explain the collapse. The author hypothesizedthat in horses with the collapse represented in Fig-ure 13A, the corniculate process medialize into theairway because of a structural weakness at the junc-tion of the corniculate and body of the arytenoidcartilage. We have information of the elastic con-tent of the body of the arytenoid cartilage 301and propose that a greater percentage of elastic content at the junction cause the body and corniculate cartilageleads to the collapse seen during exercise. Althoughwe have limited experience with this odd condition,these horses do not respond to laryngoplasty. Treat-ment at this time is still experimental. This form of collapse showed in Figure 13B has been reported in the Norwegian cold blood trot-ter, 95,302,303and we have observed it in Saddlebred, Hackney pony, Warmblood and Thoroughbred race-horses. Catherine Fjorbakk's PhD thesis is an ex- haustive explanation of the condition.304The condition is associated with poll flexion leading to an external compression of the larynx. This occurs be-cause poll flexion leads to a more cephalic position ofthe larynx and narrowing of the laryngealdiameter. 303,304The source of the intra-mandibular ex - ternal compression of the larynx is not identied but isclearly obvious on the CT exam. 304Although some histopathological evidence of RLN is present, prev- of histopathological lesion is similar tothose of nonaffected controls. 215These animals do not respond well to ventriculocordectomy with or with- out laryngoplasty. A device that restricts poll flexionhas been shown to resolve this problem. 305 The form of collapse shown in Figure 13C has been reported by at least three differentgroups 98,221,306and is not well understood. In a recent paper calling for a plea for consensus on no- menclature of upper airway obstruction, it was rec-ommended to refer to this condition as ventromedialluxation of the apex of the corniculate process of thearytenoid cartilage (VLAC). 6The condition may be unilateral or bilateral, may be obstructive or not, and can be observed in horses that also have RLN,although this is rare in the author's experience.In humans, a similar endoscopic appearance is ob-served associated posterior (i.e., dorsal) cleftof the cricoid cartilage. 307A post-mortem exam has not been performed in any affected horses but an esophageal ultrasound was performed in one caseand failed to detect a cricoid cleft. Barakzai hasreported the post-mortem exam of an affectedClydesdale horse and has suggested that the condi-tion is due to an abnormally wide transverse ary- tenoid ligament. 221Treatment at this time still experimental. Arytenoid Chondritis Horses affected with arytenoid chondritis present with various degrees of restriction or inability toabduct their affected arytenoid cartilage(s). 219,251 The condition can be unilateral or bilateral. Cur-rent evidence of this condition is a result of a pro-gressive infection following mucosal injury to thebody of the arytenoid cartilages. 219,308,309The cause of the direct mucosal trauma has been associ- ated with direct trauma from endoscopy, attempts atnasogastric intubation, inhaled foreign body (fromdirt tract?), or more violent evidence of coughingwhen both vocal process contact each other. 219,309- 311 Excessive vocalization has been hypothesized as a cause.308The author has observed an associ - ation between subepiglottic lesions and these muco-sal lesions. By inspection it seems that the ventral-lateral edge of the epiglottis contacts the medialsurface of the arytenoid cartilage and creates a mu-cosal ulceration (Fig. 14). Chondritis of the arytenoid cartilage is believed to start with a mucosal ulcer, which extends throughthe basal membrane into the arytenoid /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREThe etiopathogenesis was pursued in an experimen-tal study where mucosal ulcers were created by na-sotracheal intubation in 21 horses. 309In 52% of these horses, the lesions were healed within 1 week and another in 3 weeks. None of the horses devel-oped granuloma or clinically evident chondritis.This is consistent with the clinical nding that thesemucosal lesion are rare and only a small percentageof horses with mucosal injury progress to intralumi-nal granuloma or chondritis. 308,309Smith et al, 2006 reported in a large survey of 2317 New Zealand Thoroughbred racehorses during sales (range,15-24 months of age) only 33 horses (1.2%) hadarytenoid mucosal lesions including ve with overtchondritis. 309Horses with mucosal lesions were not statistically different than control in terms ofnumber of horses that raced. Kelly et al, 2003 re-ported on 3312 post-sales endoscopies in AustralianThoroughbreds and 21 horses (0.63%) had arytenoidmucosal lesions. There was an apparent preva-lence of farms from which they originated and werepredominantly female. Five of the 21 were knownto develop intraluminal granulomas and only one ofthem developed chondropathy. 308The low percent - age of mucosal ulcers progressing to arytenoid chon-dritis is also consistent with the low prevalence ofchondritis in Thoroughbred racehorses ranging from 0.21 to 0.22% (note that prevalence data have notbeen reported in North America). 308,309 The pathogenesis of arytenoid chondritis is be- lieved mucosal trauma to medial surface ofthe arytenoid cartilage leading to mucosal ulcer-ation. If the lesion does not extend past the base-ment membrane, epithelization occurs in 1-4weeks. If the trauma does extend past the base-ment membrane, bacterial invasion of the perichon-drium leads to formation of granulomas and possiblythe development of septic chondropathy. When thearytenoid cartilage geometry enlarges, the aryte-noid cartilage has progressive reduction in abduc-tion despite normal neuromuscular laryngealanatomy. Ultrasound now allows a much moreprecise denition of the extent of the arytenoid le-sions (enlargement of body of the arytenoid carti-lage) 118and the reader is referred to the earlier section in diagnosis. This is particularly important as in theory, resolution of the granulomas yieldsrestoration of full abduction function, whereas par-tial arytenoidectomy does not restore airway me-chanics to normal. 69The other important contribution of ultrasound in the management of arytenoid chondropathy is the identication of anabscess surrounding or in the cartilage. In thosecases, drainage of the abscess can restore full aryte-noid abduction function. 312 In the veterinary literature, medical treatment consisting of local anti-inflammatory agents /H11006anti- microbials has been reported to be associated with ahigh success in treating mucosal lesions. The au-thor has also recommended the use of hyperbarictherapy. The triage issues are based on the an-swers to the following questions: Are/is the granulomas obstructive? Does the granuloma risk causing a mucosal lesion to the other side? What is the status of abduction of the affected cartilage? If granulomas are small, they are also treated and if this modality is not successful then surgical resec-tion of the granulomas is recommended. 308,309It should be pointed out that recurrence of the granu- lomas is possible and the author would estimate thisto be approximately 30%. Similar problems havebeen seen in humans and many different techniqueshave been investigated to reduce the recurrence ofvocal process granulomas, which is approximately22-44%. 311,313The principles of treatments seems similar in the human patient counterpart where a recent analysis of treatment for vocal process gran-uloma was performed. 311 A partial arytenoidectomy is recommended on a performance horse if abduction is compromised. Asub-total may be considered on a pasture sound an-imal. The reader is referred to the above discussionon Partial Arytenoidectomy. Fig. 14. Left arytenoid chondromas associated seen over the dorsal aspectof This movement of the epiglottis is animportant part of the deglutitive airway protectivemechanism allowing the base of the epiglottis (thedorsal surface) to approximate against the adductedvocal cords and arytenoid cartilage 316 Epiglottic entrapments are seen with three broadly different presentations. It can be a congen-ital deformity (often associated with cleft palate 36), or an acquired condition, predominantly racehorses, resulting in a respiratory obstruction and/or abnor-mal upper respiratory noise. 314,317,318and nally, in mature non-racehorses it can be an acquired condi- tion resulting in coughing, nasal discharge and/ordysphagia. 182 The cause/etiology of the congenital condition is unknown, but when associated with cleft palate, itseems to be protective of tracheal penetration of feedmaterial. The acquired condition is not well under-stood. It can be seen as a sequel to an epiglotticinjury (acquired or iatrogenic) leading to inflamma-tion and swelling of the sub-epiglottic tissues anddorsal displacement (i.e., entrapment) of the glos-soepiglottic fold over the epiglottic cartilage. In-flammation and infection into the epiglottis hasbeen observed and can result in a loss and deformityof the cartilage matrix so the glossoepiglotticmembrane is relationally redundant. As entrap-ment becomes chronic, they become thickened andulcerated over time. 182,319The signicance of the entrapment is variable. It may not be affecting the horse's performance, insome thin and short entrapments, no obstruction ispresent. This is consistent with a couple surveysindicating no negative association between the pres-ence of epiglottic entrapment and racing perfor-mance. 45,74,320In other cases, the entrapment seems to cause an expiratory obstruction for which the severity correlates with the caudal extent of theentrapment. During exhalation, the entrapment islifted by the flow of air causing an obstruction. It has been reported that chronic entrapment thenbecomes thicker and ulcerated and causes pressurenecrosis on the tip of the epiglottic cartilage. 319 From the authors' perspective it is difcult to deter-mine what came rst \u2014 the entrapment or the epi-glottic chondritis. Diagnosis The diagnosis is generally straightforward with thepersistent entrapping membrane over the dorsal as-pect of the epiglottis. 74,314,319Ary-epiglottic en - trapment differs from DDSP insofar as the outline ofthe epiglottic cartilage is covered by the entrapmentand can be recognized as a separate structure fromthe soft palate (Fig. 15A). Intermittent entrap-ments may be more difcult to identify as they areoften not entrapped at the time of the exam. Manyintermittent entrapments that are not entrapped onresting examination may be made to entrap by in-ducing swallowing. This is a mechanism by whichswallowing-induced entrapment is not understood.Alternatively, one can place local anesthetic in thenasopharynx including the epiglottis and sub-epiglottic tissue after sedation. A laryngeal for-ceps is then used to grasp the sub-epiglottic tissueand force an entrapment to observe if it stays in Fig. 15. A, Epiglottic entrapment. B, Epiglottitis. 110 2016 MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART The clinician be as this in-duced entrapment may be articial. Factors suchas how long the horse stays entrapped are suscep-tible to false-positive diagnosis. The best way toassess the clinical signicance of intermittent en-trapment is to observe its occurrence during over-ground endoscopy. Treatments The principle of treatments of epiglottic axial transection of the glossoepiglotticfold 74,318,319,321-324or wedge resection of the en - trapping membrane.182,325Most commonly the procedure is performed in the sedated horses under endoscopic control thru the nasopharynx. How-ever, it can be performed on the horse standingthrough the oropharynx. Axial division can also beperformed on a short-acting general anesthesiathrough the oropharynx. This is the preferred ap-proach for procedures using the unguarded hook toprevent trauma to the soft palate, esophagus, orguttural pouch. Laryngotomy under general anes-thesia is reserved for more severe presentationswith very thick and sometimes adhered ary-epi-glottic membrane to the epiglottis. The divisionof the membrane can be achieved with a curved-hook bistoury, 317,318,322,326a shielded hook bis - toury,319electro-coagulation,324snare,327and laser surgery.321,323,326 This is a relatively successful procedure associ- ated with a recurrence rate ranging from 10 to 40%.The latter highest recurrence obtained using elec-trocautery is not recommended at this time. 74The second complication to avoid is epiglottitis. Dam- age to the epiglottis can occur with any of the tech-niques and it is the single most important technicalaspect to focus on during the procedure. Technicaltips will be presented to minimize the occurrence ofthese risks. DDSP is the second most commoncomplication after treatment for epiglottic entrap-ment. 317,322,323Although the root cause of the per - manent DDSP is not described, the author believesthey are a sequel to subepiglottic ulceration and/orepiglottitis either as a response to direct iatrogenicdamage, prior epiglottitis, or problems related tosecondary wound healing in the sub-epiglottic area. 6. Epiglottitis Etiopathogenesis Epiglottitis is an inflammatory condition that maybe of viral or bacterial origin. 74,148,328,329Bacterial and viral epiglottis are apparently common in hu- mans and are a potential life-threatening eventbecause of airway obstruction. 330-332Severe air - way obstruction is a rare occurrence in horses andthey generally present for milder obstruction, abnor-mal upper airway noise, and sometimes dyspha-gia. 148,328,333Our understanding of the true cause is extremely limited in veterinary medicine. Pre- sumably, local inflammatory agent (i.e., viral, surgi-cal trauma) leads to epiglottis. Alternatively, a foreign body perforation of the sub-epiglottic mucosaleads to bacterial invasion with marked mucosalswelling. If the infection extends through the basalmembrane of the epiglottic cartilage, this leads to anepiglottic chondritis. In the acute phase soft tissueswelling predominated, whereas in the chronic situ-ation, deformity of the epiglottic cartilage is seen.This condition may be quite painful and result incaudal retraction of the larynx and DDSP or cough-ing and/or dysphagia. Diagnosis The diagnosis is driven by the clinical signs thatdictated an endoscopic examination. Epiglottitis ischaracterized by marked swelling of the sub-epiglot-tic membrane with or without sub-epiglottic ulcer-ation. It is important for the clinician to recognizethe loss of normal border of epiglottic cartilage asepiglottitis (Fig. 15B) and differentiate this fromepiglottic entrapment (Fig. 15A). In both cases, thescalloped edge of the epiglottic cartilage is lost but incases of epiglottic entrapment there is a nite edgeto the lateral aspect of the ary-epiglottic (i.e., glos-soepiglottic) fold vs just being swollen. If there isinfection of the epiglottic cartilage, a dorsal bulge(Fig. 16A) or ulceration is observed. Treatments Acute epiglottitis are managed by local anti-inflam-matory treatment (see earlier description) and theprognosis is good if there is no epiglottic chondri-tis. 148,328Acute epiglottitis is not a surgical condi - tion unless a tracheostomy is needed to relievedyspnea, which is very rare. If epiglottic chondritisis present, the prognosis may decrease as deformityand inflammation of the epiglottic cartilage maypredispose to intermittent DDSP. The prognosismay become guarded as severe epiglottic deformityis associated with persistent DDSP. 148,150 If an epiglottic abscess is present, the author rec- ommends surgical drainage which is achieved with aminimal opening/incision in the epiglottic cartilage.This may be achieved using an endoscopic laryngealscissor and laser surgery followed by surgical lavage(Fig. 16, B and C). Sub-Epiglottic Pathology Etiopathogenesis In a study of 91 horses received for post-mortem exam from a southern California racetrack, theprevalence of sub-epiglottic pathology was 7.7%. 334 There are no evidence-based data to explain theetiology of these lesions. It has been hypothesizedthat sub-epiglottic ulcer and granulomas are second-ary to bacterial sometimes theinflammation surrounding the ulcer seems mini-mal. 335In terms of infectious agents, one study of the ulcer beds revealed low to moderate numbers of mixed bacterial colonies and no fungal elements.334 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 111FRANK J. MILNE LECTUREIt has been proposed that trauma from soft palateulceration, foreign body while swallowing (i.e., dirt,sharp ends from diet) or intermittent ary-epiglotticentrapment is the original cause of mucosal irrita-tion. The lesions are typically chronically activewith granulation tissue and hyperplastic epithelialmargins. 334 These lesions are thought to predispose the horse to intermittent or persistent DDSP and can be seenin association with ulcers of the caudal free edge of the soft palate. Diagnosis Lesions of the sub-epiglottic area are particularlyeasy to miss unless the swelling or disease extendsbeyond the lateral border of the epiglottis. The au-thor has seen a fair number of sub-epiglottic lesionsin association with mucosal lesions on the medial Fig. 16.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREaspect of the arytenoid cartilage (Fig. 14). An ob-servation of such lesions on the arytenoid cartilagewould suggest the need to explore the sub-epiglottictissue. Blea and Arthur 335emphasized the impor - tance of and described the manipulation needed toget a good examination of the sub-epiglottic tissue(glossoepiglottic fold). The horse should be sedatedand liberal application of local anesthesia is neededto the area. A \"puddle\" of local anesthesia can bemade to rest under the epiglottis cartilage if thehead is elevated to an appropriate ablunt \"laryngeal elevator\", 335or an equine laryngeal forceps is used elevate the epiglottis (Fig. 17). Without evaluating the epiglottic cartilage, it is dif-cult to have a precise and complete evaluation ofthe sub-epiglottic tissues. Management The element of treatment of this condition includesremoving the horse from active training with thecombination of local anti-inflammatory and systemicantibiotics. 335They are slow to heal and often do not fully heal. The author has tracked the healingof a few of them over 2-3 months. Empirically, theauthor often used sucralfate (20 cc at 250 mg/mL orthree tablets in 10 mL of water [1 g/tab]) three timesa day to coat the area. There are no data to conrmwhether any of the medication reaches, adheres to,or benets the area. In addition, 20-30 cc glycerincan be given orally prior to training to protect afreshly healed area. 7. Conclusion The cartilage in the upper airways crosses the nishline rst and is therefore clearly the most importantcartilage in the equine body.! Despite that, as inmany aspects of equine veterinary medicine, level 1evidence-based data is lacking to precisely guide theoptimal management course of our patients. Un-derstanding the etiopathogenesis of many of theseconditions is still surprisingly limited. Despite thelack of information, one must still recognize andtreat patients; a key factor is recognizing and inter-preting the different nuances of the clinical presen-tation. It is hoped that in the future moreevidence-based data will be gathered to guide ourrenements in treating and managing the afore-mentioned conditions. In the author's opinion, thegoals should always target less-invasive approachwith a quicker return to function. Acknowledgments To Drs. Richard P.

Debt: Integrating Student Loan Repayment Into a Personal Financial WellnessPlan Tony Bartels, DVM, MBA Navigating and objectively assessing the rapidly evolving student loan repayment options can be achallenge and signicant source of stress for the busy veterinary practitioner. This session willdescribe how you can use your debt-to-income ratio, your average monthly student loan interestaccrual, your income and family size information, and your short- and long-term career and familyplans to cater an income-driven repayment option that allows you to integrate student loan repay-ment into a strong nancial wellness plan. Author's address: Veterinary e-mail: tonyb@vin.com \u00a9 2016 AAEP. 1. Introduction For those entering veterinary school in the Fallof 2016, the estimated total cost of attendance(tuition /H11001fees/H11001average living expenses, assuming a 4% increase each year) for 4 years ranges from$147,000 to more than $393,000 depending on theschool, residency status, and borrowing needs. Although scholarships can help, most veterinary students nance their education through federalstudent loans. For those who do, interest now ac-crues on a majority of their loans during vet school,which will further increase their total cost ofattendance. With the increases in cost of attendance outpacing starting salaries, repaying educational debt can bechallenging for the recent veterinary graduate. During the Climbing Mt. Debt session, we will discuss how to analyze your student loans and thevarious options available, including income-drivenrepayment and the associated \"side effects\" of thevarious plans.The objectives of the Climbing Mt. Debt session are below: Know your student debt Know your repayment options Know your nances Know the challenges and side effects of various repayment strategies Integrate your loan repayment into a compre- hensive nancial plan 2. Solution Income-driven repayment (income-based repayment[IBR], pay as you earn [PAYE], and revised pay asyour earn [REPAYE]) are recent federal studentloan programs that base your minimum monthlypayment on your taxable income, family size, as wellas any federal student debt your spouse may have.As your income and family circumstances change,your federal student loan payment changes withyou. This will allow you to diversify your monthly 122 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS NOTEScash flow allocation and include items considered tobe nancially healthy, such as: building an emer-gency reserve, saving for retirement, planning for afamily, buying or starting a practice, as well as othershort- and long-term nancial goals. However, when we base student loan payments on income, the total balance may grow over time due tonegative amortization. As a result, income-drivenrepayment options have the potential to culminatein a forgiven balance that may be treated as taxableincome at the end of repayment. Therefore, thisstrategy requires the diligence and understanding tomove from a debt \"pay off\" to \"management\" mindsetas we often must account for a sizeable tax paymentdue in the last year of repayment. Knowing how to manage student loan(s) through an income-driven plan and prepare for the potentialforgiveness, as well as being able to compare thisstrategy against traditional repayment methodsmay save you tens to hundreds of thousands of dol-lars over the course of student loan repayment. 3. Results Let's consider a 2016 graduate who borrows$175,000 for veterinary school and accumulates$20,000 of interest during school. This graduate's starting repayment balance will be $195,000 with aweighted average interest rate of 6.22%. We will assume this graduate's rst-year salary is $45,000,increases to approximately $62,000 per year, then3.5% per year on average for the next 25 years.For the purpose of this simulation, we will assume afamily size of one for the duration of student loanrepayment. Figure 1 is a snapshot of total pro-jected repayment costs under various programs runvia the VIN Foundation Student Loan RepaymentSimulator. For those who already have a family or have mar- riage and children in their future, your family size,as well as spouse's debt and income, play a majorrole in simulating your repayment. Let's considerthe same 2016 graduate above with a starting re-payment balance of $195,000 at 6.22% and sameincome assumptions. This time, let's assume thisgraduate is married in 2018 to a small animal vet-erinary practitioner spouse who makes $70,000 peryear and carries a $170,000 federal student loanbalance. They plan to le their taxes jointly whenmarried. They will have one child in 2019 and a Fig. 1. Loan Repayment Simulation 1.

Figure 2 is a snapshot of the totalprojected repayment costs run via the VIN Founda-tion Student Loan Repayment Simulator for thegraduate only. The number and types of simulations that can be run are only limited by the number of personal sit-uations we can document or imagine. We can runsome additional simulations during the sessions toaccount for other scenarios like ling your taxesseparately from your spouse, as well as signicantincreases to income later in repayment due to prac-tice ownership. Many of these simulations will de-pend on how the borrower and spouse are paid vshow their income flows through their federal incometax returns.

Discussion Understanding your student loan repayment op-tions depends on the specics of each circumstance.Variables that contribute to the complexity includeyour borrowing history, your various loan types,your various interest rates, your current loan repay-ment plan, your income and family size, how youdocument your income, as well as your career and nancial goals. The rst step is understanding which repayment plans you can use. The second step is decidingwhich plan you should use, and the third step isknowing how to analyze and evaluate your repay-ment plan at least yearly or whenever your incomeand family situation changes. Simulation results vary greatly for each situation and the plan must be re-assessed each year or when-ever there are changes to your family and nancialsituation. From the two simulations provided in the results, we see there can be signicant savings usingincome-driven repayment options vs more tradi-tional methods, especially when the borrower's debt-to-income ratio is greater than 2. The income-driven repayment plans are primarily designed tohelp you navigate those periods where your debtexceeds your income. The length of time that situ-ation persists determines whether veterinariansshould plan for a tax liability at the time offorgiveness. When simulating income-driven repayment, we must consider the taxes due at forgiveness and Fig. 2.

If we do so as part of acomprehensive nancial plan, you may save moneyover the course of repayment while being able tomeet your other nancial goals. Income-driven repayment also requires the dili- gence to provide the required documentation eachyear or whenever your nancial or family situationchanges appreciably. Although the initial learningcurve is steep, the potential savings and flexibilityoffered can often be worth the effort.

Brokken, DVM, DACVS, DACVSMR This paper will serve to highlight abnormalities noted with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in theproximal metatarsal and tarsal regions (particularly MR ndings of horses with lameness localizedwith some type of subtarsal block) and treatment methods based off of the results of the nd-ings. The paper will also discuss current diagnostic analgesia methods and their limitations whenlocalizing lameness in this region. Author's address: The Ohio State 601 Vernon TharpStreet, Columbus, OH 43210; e-mail: brokken.1@osu.edu. and tarsal regions are acomplex and very important source of lameness inthe performance horse. Horses in a variety ofdisciplines and ages may manifest with pain asso-ciated in this region. Recently, the use of mag-netic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) in this regionhas served to improve our recognition of injuriesin this region. 1,2However, there are horses in which lameness persists or fails to improve de- spite treatment. Having amassed a moderatenumber of clinical cases with MRI (this paper will serve only to address high-eld MR images) we areslowly developing treatment strategies based onthe MR appearance of lesions and thus movingtoward more-appropriate treatment. However, itis important to note that we are in the early stagesof this and the learning curve is steep and allsuccesses and failures should be scrutinized basedon the clinical presentation of the horse, the MRndings, the treatment(s), and ultimately how thehorse responds to the treatment(s).2. Diagnostic Analgesia Lameness problems in the proximal metatarsus can be difcult to accurately diagnose because affectedhorses frequently do not have clinical signs (heat,pain, swelling) that allow the lameness to be lo-calized to this area. Frequently, the localizationof proximal metatarsal lameness is accomplishedby observing improvement after diagnostic localanalgesia. There are multiple techniques for de-sensitizing the proximal aspect of the plantarmetatarsus; local inltration, high 4- or 6-point, anddeep branch of the lateral plantar nerve (DBLPN).However, confusion exists when interpreting the re-sults due to the lack of specicity of local analgesictechniques. Many horses do not block completelysound with local analgesia of the proximal meta- tarsus. This is likely related to the nature of theblock and dependency on local diffusion through-out the region. In many cases a combination of intra-articular and regional anesthesia is crucial toaccurately isolate the lameness to this specic area.Even then, there can be confusing results due to 126 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF MRI NOTESdiffusion from one site to another. In a study thatperformed MRI examinations on horses that blockedto a DBLPN block, only 25 of 46 limbs ( /H1101154%) had injury of the proximal suspensory ligament or itsosseous attachment. 2Another study found that limbs that responded to analgesia of the proximalmetatarsal region (35.7%) had more severe changesin the distal tarsus. 3One of 12 horses with lower hock pathology demonstrated on high-eld MR im- ages also improved with a subtarsal block.4 Recent studies have investigated the in-vivo dis- tribution of contrast while performing variations ofthe single injection site technique to block theDBLPN and thus, hypothetically, the proximal sus-pensory ligament (PSL). One study investigated using two techniques with low (2 mL) and high volumes (8 mL) of a mixture ofcontrast and mepivacaine. 5Contrast diffusion was greater ( /H1101145\u00b0 distal to proximal and 20 mm dis- tal to the head of the lateral splint bone) comparedwith the technique that was perpendicular to thelimb and 15 mm distal to the head of the lateralsplint. The authors also concluded that despite sig-nicant differences, contrast diffusion could be vari-able irrespective of the technique or volume used.They also concluded that the high-volume of injec-tion may have increased the risk of false-positiveresults. With regard to accidental injection of ad-jacent synovial structures, 16% of injections (5/32)were in the tarsal sheath (found with both tech-niques) and 6% of injections (2/32) were in the tar-sometatarsal joint (all with the perpendiculartechnique /H1101115 mm distal to the head of the lateral splint bone). Interestingly, six of seven synovialinjections were in the right hindlimb (suggestive ofdifculty of \"cross-handed\" injection for right-handed individuals). In study by Contino et al, 6the concentra - tion of mepivacaine was investigated in the tarso-metatarsal joint after the single injection (DBLPN)technique ( /H1101120 mm distal to the head of the lateral splint with 3 mL perpendicular to skin). The authorsfound that 25% of limbs had a sufcient amount ofmepivacaine in the joint to produce analgesia. In ad-dition, they also performed a contrast study with asimilar injection technique and found that 37.5% oflimbs (3/8) had contrast in the tarsal sheath and nocontrast was found in the tarsometatarsal joint. Due to the possible confusion associated with this region when performing diagnostic analgesia, theauthor prefers to perform a block of the lower twotarsal joints at some point during the diagnosticworkup; typically after improvement from a subtar-sal block. In horses with radiographic evidence oflower-hock osteoarthritis, performing analgesia ofthe lower hocks after a positive response of a sub-tarsal block is very important to determine how toproceed in the diagnostic and therapeutic workup.In addition, taking into consideration the degree oflameness of the horse as well as historical informa-tion (i.e., horse typically has hocks injected and now has become nonresponsive to the injections andlameness has worsened is a typical presentation ofproximal suspensory injury or, less commonly, boneinjury of the lower tarsus). 3. Diagnostic Imaging (MRI) After localization of lameness to the proximal meta-tarsal region, radiographic and ultrasonographic ex-amination should be routine. If the diagnosis is notdetermined or if it is inconclusive, MRI may be per-formed. Based on the limitations already discussedregarding diagnostic analgesia in this region, it iscritical that the tarsus (at least from the proximalintertarsal joint distally) also be included in an MRexamination of the proximal metatarsal region(Fig. 1). Depending on the MR unit and the indi-vidual variation between horses, positioning of thehorse to this level may be challenging. StandingMR images aof this region are certainly possible and can provide valuable information; however, motion artifacts are common and eld-of-view limitationsmay make it difcult and impractical to scan such alarge region. Due to the concern about motion, di-agnostic fat-suppressed images (which can be veryhelpful for bone injuries, etc.) can be very difcult toacquire in the standing patient. In addition, theauthor believes that the contralateral limb should bescanned if possible (even if it is an abbreviated scan)due to the propensity for bilateral disease in thisregion. 4. Abnormalities Identied With MR Imaging Proximal Suspensory Injury There are several types of injuries to the proximal suspensory ligament that have been identied withMRI. Typically, there is increased size of the liga-ment with areas of increased signal intensity; typi- Fig. 1. Sagittal MR image representing the area (distal talus toproximal 1/3 of the metatarsus) that should be evaluated inhorses with lameness localized to proximal metatarsal region. /H114082016 127IN-DEPTH: CLINICAL OF MRIcally more dorsally located within the ligament (Fig.2). These areas of increased signal (ber disrup-tion) can be present at the level where the ligamentattaches to the proximal cannon bone and/or justdistal to the attachment with extension distally forseveral centimeters. The author has also identiedhorses with injury to the proximal extension of thesuspensory ligament in the distal tarsal region (Fig.3) at or near its attachment onto the third tarsalbone. With regards to enlargement, there are also horses in which there is irregular and thickenedtissue at the border of the ligament; typically asso-ciated with the lateral splint bone. At surgery,these horses have adhesion/increased tissue forma-tion that connects from the ligament to the splint bone (Fig. 4). In addition to the ligamentous injury, some horses will also have osseous reaction in the plantar aspectof the proximal cannon bone at the attachment ofthe PSL. Typically, this is an area of low signalintensity within the plantar medullary cavity; rep-resentative of sclerosis on proton density sequences.This also demonstrates the fact that when mostproximal injuries are noted, they are more chronic innature. In some horses, there will be increasedsignal intensity within the plantar medullary cavity/cortex on the fat-suppressed images. This is indic-ative of a more acute injury at the ligamentousattachment (Fig. 5). Tarsal Abnormalities Examination of the distal tarsal region with MRcan also demonstrate damage associated with thearticular surface of the tarsometatarsal and distalintertarsal joints. In particular, MR imaging hasallowed us to identify the horses with lower hockcartilage/bone damage associated with the plantaraspect of the joints as well as surrounding the inter-tarsal ligaments (Fig. 6). In addition, there havebeen horses with osseous cyst-like lesions noted inthe distal tarsus that MR imaging allows character-ization of the activity and joint involvement. Pri-mary bone injuries have also been identied in thetarsus with typical locations adjacent to the inter-tarsal ligament in the central or third tarsal bones,the head of the splint bones, or in the plantar aspectof the tarsus (Fig. 7, A and B).

Davis et al 7 described four horses with injury to the lateraldigital flexor tendon at the level of the proximalsuspensory ligament. All horses had lamenesslocalized to the proximal metatarsal/distal tarsal region before MRI. Based on the MR abnormalitiesin the lateral digital flexor tendon, all horses re-sponded positively to tarsal sheath anesthesia. 5. Treatment Proximal Suspensory Whereas most with acute proximal suspen- sory desmitis of the forelimb respond well to stallrest and a regime of controlled exercise, hindlimbinjuries have a much lower prognosis with conser-vative therapy. 8In addition, there is a large num - ber of horses where lameness persists or reoccurswith exercise. Some have hypothesized that thepoor prognosis and persistent lameness is due to acompartment syndrome from the enlarged PSLcausing compression of the plantar metatarsalnerves (particularly the DBLPN) the restric-tion revealed evi-dence of chronic nerve compression. 9Recently, new surgical procedures have been aimed at decom- pression, desensitization, and promoting angiogene-sis of the injured PSL. The most popular surgicalprocedure of late has been neurectomy of theDBLPN and plantar fasciotomy as described byBathe. the thick plantar meta - tarsal fascia restricts the expansion of the injuredPSL leading to a local compartment syndrome andcompression of the plantar metatarsal nerves. Thepremise for developing this surgical procedure wasthat persistent lameness is due to both compart-ment syndrome and chronic local nerve irritation.In horses with desmitis of the PSL without otheradjacent abnormalities, neurectomy and fasciotomyalone are performed. In horses with severe ultra-sonographic abnormalities in the ligament, thesehorses are injected with some type of autologouscell-based therapy in addition to the surgery. Bathereports success rates of 79% in horses that under-went neurectomy and fasciotomy alone. With cell-based injections and surgery, the success rate wasreported to be 84%. Only 55% of those horses withligament and osseous damage returned after sur-gery. In the publication by Dyson and Murray,78% of horses with primary proximal suspensorydesmopathy without major conformational issues orother managedsuccessfully with neurectomy and fasciotomy (re-turned to full athletic function at their previous levelfor/H110221 y). 11They also concluded that surgery is contraindicated in horses with straight hind-limb conformation or excessive extension in the metatar-sophalangeal joints. It still remains unknown what effect performing fasciotomy alone without neurectomy and vice versahas on horses with proximal suspensory injury.Information presented by To \u00b4 t he ta l 9suggests that just excising a portion of the deep branch of the Fig. 5. Transverse fat-suppressed image of the proximal meta-tarsus depicting increased signal in the plantar medullary cavityof the third metatarsal bone (arrow) indicating an Fig. 6. Sagittal fat-suppressed image of the proximal metatar-sus/distal tarsus depicting loss of joint space of the distal inter-tarsal joint (arrows) which extends into the region of theintertarsal ligament (arrowhead). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 allowhorses with Hewes 12report a procedure hindlimb proximal suspensory injurythat allowed 87% of horses return to full work,suggesting that decompression and or ligamentsplitting may be effective in returning horses toperformance. In addition, there are veterinarianswho just perform a fasciotomy (typically along withsome type of intralesional regenerative therapy)with reported results similar to that of performing afasciotomy and neurectomy. In horses with osseous abnormalities at the at- tachment of the PSL to the cannon bone, some havesuggested that performing osteostixis or \"scoring\"the boney surface may help some of these horsesreturn to exercise. 12,13 In horses with concurrent osseous and ligamen- tous injuries, advanced imaging will allow determi-nation if the osseous injury is acute or chronic (i.e.,increased signal on the fat-suppressed images in theproximal third metatarsal bone at the PSL originsuggests an acute bone injury). In horses withacute osseous injuries, appropriate time to allow thebone to remodel is necessary (the author prefers /H1135060 d stall connement). Additional treatment for theconcurrent PSL injury could also be performed dur-ing this time. The author prefers not to performneurectomy/fasciotomy in horses with acute osseousinjuries noted on MRI. Tarsal Abnormalities For horses diagnosed with primary damage in thedistal tarsal region, treatments typically consist ofcortisone, with or without hyaluronic acid, injection.If a primary bone injury is detected on MR imageswith little, if any, joint involvement, these horses typically respond well to a 90-day stall rest withlimited handwalking protocol to allow time for thebone to remodel. In horses with severe cartilagedamage/osteoarthritis or horses that become nonre-sponsive to intra-articular cortisone injections, a va-riety of facilitated arthrodesis techniques have beenadvocated. Surgical drilling or passing a diode la-ser across the joint seems to be the most commonsurgical procedures currently performed. In addi-tion, injection of ethyl alcohol has been studied toaid in the fusion of the lower hock joints. However, there is concern about communication with the prox-imal intertarsal joint. Horses treated with lasersurgery or ethyl alcohol typically are more com-fortable and less lame compared with horses thathave drilling performed. 14However, horses with marked osteoarthritis can make laser surgery (with- out predrilling) and ethyl alcohol injections moredifcult or impossible to perform. 6. Summary In conclusion, determination of the exact cause oflameness in the proximal metatarsal/tarsal regioncan be very difcult modalities. MRI is a valuablediagnostic modality that allows diagnosis of injuryin horses with lameness localized to these regions.The ability to accurately diagnose the source oflameness is important in selecting treatment thatwill maximize the chance to return to performance.Future research should be aimed at describing whattype of specic treatment should be performed onhorses with specic MRI ndings and the results oftreatment.

In a recentsurvey of causes of lameness in different horsebreeds, synovitis or osteoarthritis of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint was consistently listed as one of the10 most common causes of lameness in all categoriesof sport horses surveyed. Fetlock pain was rankedmore highly as a cause of lameness in racehorsesthan in nonracing sport horses. 1However, lame - ness referable to the fetlock region can sometimes bedifcult to accurately diagnose. A careful and com-plete examination of the distal limb of the horse willoften indicate the fetlock as a clinical problem. A positive distal limb flexion, frequently thought to be associated with a MPJ problem may actuallybe due to lameness from elsewhere on the distallimb. In addition, the clinical examination may notconclusively identify the MPJ as the source of lame-ness. Conrming the MPJ region as the source ofpain is critical to direct imaging of the appropriatearea of this region. Placement of local analgesiadirectly into the MPJ (intra-articular or intra-synovial) often results in a rapid and signicantresolution of the lameness associated with the fet-lock joint. In contrast, some conditions that affectthis joint (particularly in young racehorses in race training) do not respond to intra-articular analgesiabut require perineural (regional) diagnostic analge-sia to resolve the lameness. Regional diagnosticanalgesia should be performed in a distal-to-proxi-mal sequence with the clinician being cognizant thatproperly placed nerve blocks can anesthetize struc-tures proximal to the site of injection. If the fetlock is considered the source of lameness then intra-articular analgesia of the MPJ should beperformed rst. If this is negative, analgesia of thedigital nerves at the level of the base of the sesamoidnerve block should then be performed, eliminatingthe distal limb as a source of pain. If this is nega-tive then a low palmar/plantar nerve block to isolatethe MC region as the source of the lameness shouldbe performed. Unfortunately, it is now commonlyrecognized that the blocking patterns just describedare not always accurate. Abaxial nerve blocks can effectively anesthetize the palmar/plantar aspect ofthe fetlock joint and an intra-articular jointblock may effectively block some of the distal sesa-moidean ligament injuries. In addition, it has beenfound that on occasion a well-placed palmar digitalnerve block can quite effectively block out a fetlockregion problem due to retrograde flow of the anes-thetic solution. 2Intrathecal anesthesia of the dig - 132 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF sheath (DFTS) was effective atimproving lameness in of 22 horses with mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI)-conrmed distalsesamoidean ligament (DSL) injury. In addition,intra-articular anesthesia improved lameness in 11of 19 horses with DSL desmitis near their origin onthe base of the proximal sesamoid bones (PSBs) andthree of three with lameness due to collateral liga-ment (CL) injury. 3 Once the MPJ is determined to be the source of the pain, diagnostic imaging is directed to evaluatethe bone and soft tissue structures of the joint.Given that many injuries that occur in the fetlockinvolve multiple structures, careful assessment ofboth bone and soft tissue structure involvementshould be performed. Knowing the specic struc-ture(s) and the severity of injury is critical to appro-priately determine the prognosis and appropriatelytreat and rehabilitate injuries of this area. Radio-graphic, ultrasonographic, and occasionally nuclearscintigraphic examinations are routinely used toevaluate the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCJ).Radiographic examination and nuclear scintigraphyare considered bone imaging techniques and ultra-sonography a soft-tissue-imaging technique. Eachof these imaging techniques has known limitationswhen assessing the MPJ. When clinical examina-tion and diagnostic analgesia indicates the fetlockjoint as the source of pain but these examinationtechniques provide little denitive results MRI ex-amination is indicated. MRI is now considered the gold standard for im- aging the distal limb of the horse. It can provideinformation about both bone and soft tissue whilealso demonstrating both pathologic and physiologicchanges in tissue. The choice of protocols is deter-mined by the type of scanner, the region under scru-tiny, and the preference of the attending clinician.Consequently, protocols often differ between hospi-tals. Sequences and image planes should be stan-dardized to allow for comparison between limbs andbetween horses. Deviation from the standardizedprotocol complicates interpretation and may lead tomisdiagnosis. Increasing scanning times prolongsrecumbency, which can result in post-anestheticcomplications. The best assessment of an anatom-ical region requires images to be obtained in threeplanes, sagittal, dorsal, and transverse. At NorthCarolina State a extremity radiofre-quency flared-end 1.5 shot) sequence with fat saturation in thetransverse and sagittal planes and a 3D T1 FISP(fast imaging with steady precession) sequence inthe dorsal plane. It is helpful to place the affectedlimb down to enhance the image quality by minimiz- ing motion and to use the contralateral limb forcomparison. Using the opposite limb for compari-son is essential to determine whether a suspicioussignal in a structure is real or a normal anatomicalvariation. In addition, bilateral pathology canmanifest at the same locations, which requires care-ful reading of the signicance of some signalabnormalities. The fetlock region is becoming a common site of MRI to help accurately diagnose the causes of lame-ness in sport horses in a variety of disciplines. 3-8 The fetlock region becomes a candidate for an MRIwhen pain has been localized to the fetlock regionusing diagnostic analgesia but radiographic or ultra-sonographic examination are appreciatesignicant sufcient to explain thedegree of lameness. 9King et al3reported on 232 horses with lameness localized to the fetlock region that were without a radiographic diagnosis. Soft-tissue abnormalities were observed in 218 limbs(162 horses). Subchondral bone (SCB) and articu-lar cartilage abnormalities were in 43limbs (34 horses). Oblique distal sesamoidean lig-ament desmitis was the primary abnormality ob-served in 73 limbs (56 horses). Straight distalsesamoidean ligament desmitis was the primary ab-normality observed in 44 limbs (38 horses). In an-other retrospective study of 40 horses that had thefetlock evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR), itwas found that the most common injury to be SCBabnormalities of the distal metacarpus. Cartilageand osteochondral lesions in joint andinjuries of the suspensory ligament branches andPSBs were less common but also occurred with reg-ular frequency. Concurrent soft-tissue injurieswere present in 63% (25/40) of with SCBinjury, most commonly involving the suspensory ap-paratus. 8Both studies found that the most com - mon soft-tissue injury was of the distal sesamoideanligaments (DSL) although the prevalent DSL injuryoccurred in the straight sesamoidean ligament(SSL) in one study and the oblique sesamoideanligament (OSL) in the other. 3,8Abnormalities of SCB and lesions of distal sesamoidean ligaments have also been frequently diagnosed in other re-ports. 6,7,10SCB injuries can be diagnosed with low- eld MRI5but there are currently no reports on distal sesamoidean ligament injuries diagnosed with low-eld MRI. 2. SCB Abnormalities Normal SCB thickness of the distal aspect of thethird metacarpal/metatarsal bone and proximalphalanx can be quite variable and is likely to changewith the type and intensity of exercise the horseperforms. In general, the SCB thickness of the dis-tal aspect of the third metacarpal bone varies fromdorsal to and from abaxial to beingthinnest axially and thickest in the middle of eachcondyle, especially toward the palmar aspect. 9 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 133IN-DEPTH: CLINICAL OF MRIThe SCB thickness of the proximal phalanx in-creases slightly toward the palmar aspect of eachcondyle. There is reasonable symmetry in SCBthickness of both the third metacarpal bone andproximal phalanx. Joint injury is often manifested in the SCB. SCB remodeling due to repetitive cyclic loading can leadto sclerosis, which can become painful, often withoutdisruption of the articular cartilage. The most rec-ognizable example of chronic SCB trauma in horsesis seen in cases of nonadaptivebone remodeling can develop focal osteonecrosis inthe center of an area of sclerosis in the palmar/plantar condyles of the metacarpus/metatarsus.When located close to the articular surface, osteone-crosis may lead to secondary articular cartilagedamage and loss. The MR signal changes associ-ated with this condition are often seen as diffuse T1,PD, and T2 signal decrease consistent with trabec-ular thickening and osteosclerosis. Occasionallythe changes progress to diffuse or focal increase insignal in fat-suppressed images as well. SCB damage can also occur due to traumatic in- cidents with or without articular cartilage damage.A \"bone bruise\" is a well-recognized cause of jointpain in people and is identied using MRI. Acutetraumatic injury can develop a fluid-like signal thatappears in bone as diffuse or focal increase in signalin fat-suppressed images. Diffuse or focal increasein signal in fat-suppressed images is a descriptiveterm called bone edema or bruising. Microfrac-tures in the trabecular bone can lead to hemorrhageand edema and are likely the source of the abnormalhigh-signal intensity. Often these acute injuriesoccur without sclerotic changes. When these inju-ries occur in sites of normal sclerotic change it maybe difcult to stage the injury, making it unclearwhether the presence of bone-edema signal is anindication of acute traumatic accumulation of in-flammatory fluid, or whether it may occur as a con-sequence of chronic SCB remodeling and brosiswith or without venous congestion. Occasionally,small osseous cyst-like lesions may withtrabecular necrosis demonstrated by a focal T1, PD,and T2 signal increase, often with a sclerotic rim ofbone. Osteoarthritis with associated articular cartilage damage and/or loss can lead to increased low signalin SCB with related increased bone density. It washoped that MRI would be a good imaging modality todetermine the status of articular cartilage damageseen in osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, particularlywith respect to the fetlock joint of the horse, thisdoes not seem to be the case. Several studies havereported on the inaccuracy of MR imaging in thedetection of cartilage lesions. Small cartilage de-fects can be difcult to detect in both people and inhorses. The location of focal articular cartilage le-sions are most often located in the medial condyle of the distal third metacarpal/metatarsal bone 3,8with a preference for the palmar/plantar aspect of the condyle.4,5,10The dorsal aspect of the condyles can also be affected with traumatically induced focal cartilage defects most often seen in non-racehorses.8 Several papers have described the presence of proximal phalanx fractures not demonstrated on ra-diographs but seen with MR. 3,11Although sagittal fractures of the proximal phalanx are seen primarily in racehorses, they are now being reported in sporthorses. These fractures are usually nondisplacedand begin at the dorsoproximal joint surface, mak-ing it difcult to appreciate radiographically unlessthe radiographic beam angle is positioned appropri-ately. Diagnostic analgesia can effectively elimi-nate pain associated with this condition and allownormal weight bearing, which could lead to fracturepropagation. Quite surprisingly, several reports ofappropriately placed diagnostic analgesia at thelevel of the palmar digital and basi-sesamoid caneffectively eliminate the pain associated with thesetypes of fractures. 3. Distal Sesamoidean Ligament Injuries As mentioned earlier, the most commonly diagnosedsoft-tissue injury seen on MRI of the fetlock regionis to the DSLs. 3,8Both of these studies reported difculty in the use of diagnostic ultrasound to accurately diagnosis these injuries. On MR exam-ination, the straight distal sesamoidean ligament(SSL) has a heterogeneous appearance with multi- ple high- and low-signal areas spread throughout most of its length. 7A normal small homogenous triangular signal hyperintensity exists at the inser- tion of the SSL onto the middle phalanx in theproton density and/or T1 weighted sequences. The oblique distal sesamoidean ligaments (OSLs)have intermediate signal intensity due to brocarti-lage separating the collagen bundles at their proxi-mal aspect and heterogeneous signal intensitythroughout their entire length from origin to inser-tion. The lateral OSL is frequently larger and morehyperintense than the medial ligament. 7Because of the variation between individual horses, imaging both limbs is critical to identify variations in signalintensity as normal or abnormal. In standing MRexaminations, images of the proximal third of theOSLs are susceptible to magic angle effect, espe-cially medially. This effect results from the diver-gence of bers within the proximal third of eachOSL, and the tendency for the medial OSL to be at amore oblique angle to the vertical than the lateralOSL. Magic angle effect results in increased signalintensity in the ligaments, thereby confounding im-age interpretation. 12 The heterogeneity of the DSLs varies between individual horses.13Normal signal heterogeneity should not be confused with the presence of abnor- mal signal hyperintensity, which commonly covers alarger cross-sectional area in several consecutive 134 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF MRIslices. Lesions within the OSLs and SSLs can re-sult in discrete or diffuse areas of signal hyperinten-sity within the body or along the edge of the affectedligament. One or multiple small core lesions withfocal-signal increase may be observed in affectedligaments, extending from 5 to 30 mm in a proxim-odistal direction. Enlargement of a ligament mayalso occur with or without abnormal signal increase,but this nding is less consistent. Lesions may oc-cur biaxially or bilaterally. King et al 3found that of 22 horses diagnosed with DSL injury, all blockedto an intrathecal analgesia of the DFTS. In addi-tion, they also found that intra-articular anesthesiaimproved lameness in 11 of 19 horses with DSLdesmitis near their origin on the base of the PSBs. The location of lesions within the distal sesam- oidean ligaments and the distribution of lesions varies between studies. 6-8Straight sesamoidean ligament desmitis occurs more commonly in the dis- tal part of the ligament, proximal to its insertion onthe middle phalanx, 6,7although proximal lesions near the origin were most common in one study.8 Oblique sesamoidean desmitis can occur proximallyor throughout the of ligament. 6-8 Cruciate distal sesamoidean desmitis is very rare.7 Reports suggest that when DSL desmitis occurs it is frequently regarded as the primary cause of lame-ness, 6,8although another author considered lesions to be the sole cause of lameness in only 2 of 58 horseswith evidence of desmitis. 7The majority of horses with OSL or SSL desmitis diagnosed with MRI do not have a palpable enlargement or ultrasono-graphic abnormalities. 6-8King et al3reported that OSL injury was diagnosed more frequently in West- ern performance horses (34%) compared with hunterjumpers (29%), racehorses and 11%). 3In that study, SSL jury was more common in Warmbloods Suspensory Ligament Branch Injuries Suspensory ligament branch injuries often occur insport horses, sometimes without palpable localizingclinical signs, although there may be accentuation oflameness after distal limb flexion. Desmitis of themedial and or lateral branches of the suspensoryligament (SL) in forelimbs and hind limbs is a rela-tively common injury in all types of sports horses. Usually only a single branch is affected in a single limb, although both branches may be affected, espe-cially in hind limbs. With the distal quarter of thebranch positioned subsynovially branch, desmitiscases can often improve to an intra-articular block ofthe fetlock joint. Each branch inserts primarily onto the abaxial surface of the ipsilateral PSB, apices of signal in-tensity (hypointense) can make dening the two structures as separate difcult. The suspensoryligament branches are paired triangular structuresof low signal intensity that flatten in a dorsopalmardirection and widen lateromedially as they movedistally toward their insertion on the PSBs. Themargins of the branches are sharply delineated.Close to the insertion, the branches become C-shaped on cross section and high intensity, lineardorsopalmar striations appear in the branches, pos-sibly associated with adaptive brocartilagenousmetaplasia at the insertion. A small hyperintenseindentation may be present in the palmar border ofthe (normal suspensory) branch immediately proxi-mal to its insertion. Suspensory branch lesions are characterized by an intraligamentous focus of signal hyperintensityin PD, T2, and STIR images, usually near the pal-mar/plantar border of the affected branch, with orwithout enlargement of the branch. Enlargementand increased high signal intensity may only be-come evident when compared with the contralaterallimb. Pathology associated with distal suspensory liga- ment desmopathy can often continue onto its inser-tion to the PSB, which signicantly increases risk ofbone pathology. When there is an increase in thecross-sectional area of the ligament with desmopa-thy, there is often a statistically signicant higherrisk of PSB pathology, as seen with MRI. 12 5. Injuries of the PSBs Abnormal MR signal in the PSBs includes osteoscle-rosis, STIR hyperintensity consistent with boneedema focal bone lossassociated with osseous lesions the at-tachment site of ligaments. Hyperintense lesionsassociated with osteolysis may be found at the axialmargin the PSBs in association with intersesam-oidean (ISL) desmitis. and distal margins of the sesamoid bonesmay be present in association with osteoarthritis ofthe fetlock joint. 6. Articular Cartilage Abnormalities MRI carries the distinct advantage of being able todetect bone and cartilage abnormalities not visibleon radiographs. However, the cartilage on the dis-tal surface of the third metacarpal/metatarsal bonein the fetlock joint is very difcult to image due tothe curved distal margin and due to the fact that thearticular cartilage layer is very thin. This jointtests the limits of current MR systems and the ca-pability of these systems to resolve ne detail. 14 Volumetric averaging occurs making it difcult toidentify abnormalities in this thin articular carti-lage. Using thinner slice thicknesses and obtain-ing slices perpendicular to the articular surface canmake it easier to identify cartilage defects. Protondensity or T1-weighted images with fat suppressioncan be helpful in creating differences in signal in- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 135IN-DEPTH: CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF MRItensity the synovialfluid and SCB, making easier. Smallosteochondral (OC) defects occur commonly on themedial condyle in horses of all types and occur morefrequently in the forelimbs. Cartilage lesions mayalso occur as isolated focal injuries with localizedcartilage loss and little evidence of osteoarthritis oras part of the disease complex of an osteoarthriticjoint. Cartilage injury or degeneration that resultsin wear lines or erosions in the cartilage is usuallyidentied by the focal accumulation of hyperintensejoint fluid in cartilage defects on PD and STIR im-ages. Focal, irregular islands of fluid hyperinten-sity associated with pooling of synovial fluid in a chondral defect can sometimes be recognized on trans-verse PD, T2, or STIR images that are located exactlyparallel with and through the affected articular sur-face. Cartilage defects have been identied on allarticular surfaces in the fetlock joint. 8MR imaging tends to underestimate the size and extent of cartilage loss in the fetlock joint compared with arthroscopicndings. 8King et al3found few articular cartilage abnormalities that did not involve the SCB. Abnor- malities observed were thinning of the articular carti-lage with decreased signal intensity. However, therewere 36 horses in which a SCB or cartilage injury andsoft-tissue injury were concurrently diagnosed and theprimary cause of the lameness could not be deter-mined. SCB damage can occur alone without disrup-tion of the articular cartilage by repetitive cyclicloading or by one-time, traumatic incidents. In-creased low signal in SCB can be due to increased bonedensity as a result of osteoarthritis and loss of articu-lar cartilage; this could be the cause of increased bonesclerosis observed in some of the horses. Osteophytes may be seen as contour changes of the proximal and distal articular margins of thesesamoid bones and the dorsoproximal, lateral, andmedial margins of the proximal phalanx. However,osteophytes may be more easily recognized on radio-graphs due to the radiographic summation effectand the better radiographic contrast between corti-cal bone soft-tissue attachments at the jointmargins. 7. Osteochondral Fragmentation Osteochondral defects are often the result of osteo-chondrosis or trauma. Osteochondral fragmentsfrom the dorsal eminences of from the margin ofthe PSBs may not be visible radiographically butmay be recognized as focal, osseous hypointensitiesseparated from parent bone on all sequences. Os-seous fragments may be difcult to distinguish fromend-on blood vessels near joint margins as both mayappear hypointense on MRI. Sagittal FLASH andPD images are most helpful in identifying thesefragments. Fragments that occur within or aroundthe attachment of the suspensory or distal sesam-oidean ligaments to bone can be difcult to discernas they are both hypointense. Large OC defectsoccur most commonly around proximal P1 and the medial Small OC defects occurred mostcommonly on the medial condyle and were seen inall types of horses. OC defects as a group werediagnosed more frequently in the forelimbs. 8. Abnormalities of the Digital Flexor Tendons and Associated Sheath Injuries to the and deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) in the DFTS maybe recognized as dispersed small, focal areas of sig-nal hyperintensity, distinct hyperintense core le-sions, thickening of the affected lobe(s) and/orlongitudinal parasagittal splits of the lateral or me-dial border of the tendon with partial separation ofthe tendon margin. Lesions of the SDFT withinthe DFTS may also extend distally into one of thebranches of the tendon into its insertion. In theKing study, 3SDF tendonitis was diagnosed in 10 limbs (nine horses) and involved the manica flexoria in six limbs (ve horses). Abnormalities in themanica flexoria appeared as thickening with diffuseincreased high signal intensity and often with overttears. DDFT injuries are often visualized as en-larged with diffuse areas of increased high signalintensity, and core lesion. Lesions of the DDFTwithin the DFTS may continue distally the insertion the distal and contour changes of the flexortendons within the DFTS are most obvious in trans-verse FLASH (gradient echo) images and frequentlynot visible ultrasonographically. Flexor tendon ab-normalities seem to be uncommon in the reports ofMR evaluation of the fetlock probably because theseinjuries are frequently seen with diagnostic ultra-sound and addressed without the need for MR evaluation. 9. Other Abnormalities Other injuries have been reported in the fetlockregion with a lower incidence than those listedabove, including desmitis of the intersesamoideanligament (ISL) and CL. 8Intersesamoidean desmi - tis results in a large or small, focal, central area ofhyperintensity within the ISL in T2, PD, and STIRimages. Extension of the inflammatory changethat extends the axial surfaces of the PSBs isconsidered axial osteitis. repre-sented as an area of intraosseous hyperintensityconfluent with the area of signal increase in the ISL.MR imaging proves helpful to dene the extent ofthe osteolysis and determine whether the fetlockjoint or the DFTS is/are involved. Increased fluiddistension and intrathecal soft tissue proliferation ofthe DFTS may occur with associated change in thepalmar annular ligament (PAL). Primary PAL abnormalities unrelated to ISL desmitis and axial osteitis can be seen as thickeningof the ligament. Primary PAL abnormalities canbe seen as thickening of the ligament and mildlyincreased high signal intensity. Flexor tendinitis 136 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF MRIcan occur in association with or due to abnormalitiesof the PAL. In addition, insertional injuries to thePSBs do occur as isolated injuries and often haveabnormal high signal intensity visualized on fat-suppressed images. Other soft-tissue injuries canbe seen infrequently. They included thickening of the brocartilage pad and dorsal joint capsule thick-ening or tearing increased high signal intensity. CL desmitis does occur and is characterized by enlargement of the supercial or deep part of the CLrelative to the contralateral limb and by the pres-ence of hyperintensity in T2 and PD images in theaffected part of the ligament. Signal increase maybe difcult to recognize in the deep part of the col-lateral ligament as this structure is frequently ob-scured on MR images by the presence of magic angleeffect when the leg is aligned with the central axis ofa high eld magnet. Evidence of endosteal re-sponse may be present as an irregularity at theorigin of a collateral ligament. A small avulsionfragment at the base of the epicondylar fossa inassociation with CL desmitis has been described. 8 In one study, lameness due to CL injury improvedthree of three horses with intra-articular fetlockanesthesia. 3 Short incomplete sagittal P1 fractures have been found on MR when radiographs were negative. Inone study of TB racehorses with pain originating fromthe fetlock region examined with standing MR, it wasfound that 19/131 (14.5%) horses were diagnosed withshort incomplete sagittal plane fractures of P1. Fivehind limbs and 14 forelimbs were affected. Focal lin-ear hyperintensity was seen withinthe dorsal articular margin (84.2%) of cases surrounded marked boneremodeling (BMO-type signal) (STIR and T2* hyper-intensity/T1 hypointensity). 11 Conclusion The main advantage of using MRI to evaluate thelameness felt to originate in the fetlock region isaccurate denition of the specic cause(s) of lame-ness. As many of these injuries are not often appar-ent with conventional imaging tools (radiographicand ultrasonographic examination) it may be thatMRI is the only imaging tool capable of demonstrat-ing the injury(s). Treatment obviously should bechosen based on the specic injury(s) and can bemodied based on the specic structure, the site andseverity of injury, and the suspected duration of theinjury. This is often heavily influenced by clinicianpreference/experience. Discussion of specic injuriesand their treatments will be addressed during thepresentation.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Pathology in numerousstructures within the foot can cause clinical signs ofnavicular syndrome, the liga-ments, middle phalanx, or laminae. 9-19Abnormal-ities in any of these structures have the potential to cause pain, which is alleviated by injection of localanesthetic around the palmar digital nerves(PDNs). 9-19With the myriad of different patho- logic problems that can be present within the foot,treatment can vary greatly depending upon the du-ration of the problem and the location of the patho-logic change. 15,20 The purpose of this paper is to identify the use- fulness of MRI in making an accurate diagnosis oflameness that has been localized to the foot andhighlight common pathologic problems within thefoot and anatomical structures that can often goundiagnosed with conventional diagnostic modal-ities. In addition, therapeutic approaches andprognosis, when a diagnosis is determined, will bediscussed. Foot Pain In cases in which lameness is abolished by a palmardigital nerve block (PDNB), a common misconcep-tion is that pathology is isolated to the palmar/plantar structures of the foot (i.e. DDFT, navicularbone, navicular bursa, DSIL, and CSL). Althoughthis is true in many cases, there is also a propensityfor a routine PDNB to alleviate pain associated with 138 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF MRI NOTESnumerous other structures in close proximity (i.e.straight and oblique sesamoidean ligament, pasternjoint, cofn joint, middle and fetlock joint). 21As equine veteri - narians become more aware of the number of abnor-malities that can be present within the foot andsurrounding structures, we continually strive to be-come more specic with our blocking patterns.However, even with the addition of more specicblocks (cofn joint, tendon sheath, navicular bursa,unilateral PDNs), it difcult or impossible toisolate the cause of lameness to a single structure,given that multiple structures can be and are com-monly affected. 2. Specic Pathologic Abnormalties Bone Abnormalities Bone EdemaBone edema is a common term that is used in ad-vanced diagnostic imaging and can be misleading.\"Bone edema\" is simply an abnormal increase insignal on any fat-saturated sequence (Fig. 1). Theterm implies that if edema is present, inflammationis also present. Although this is sometimes true,this increase in signal can also suggest many patho-logic processes that are not inflammatory in naturesuch as hemorrhage, necrosis/osteonecrosis, or bro-sis. 22,23Based on personal experience, by far the most common location of bone edema within the footis the navicular bone. In addition to the navicularbone, other common locations for bone edema in-clude P2 (predominately distal P2) and P3. Al-though some minor osseouschanges such as periarticular remodeling/navicularbone degeneration, specic denitive only possible with Bone DegenerationThe severity of navicular bone degeneration is some-times quite difcult to predict based on radiographicstudies alone (Fig. 2). It is well documented thatradiographic changes, or the lack of radiographicabnormalities of the navicular bone do not alwayscorrelate with clinical Palmar the navicular bone are easily diagnosed with MRIbut can commonly be overlooked on radiographicstudies.Subchondral Bone and Cartilage InjuriesMultiple abnormalities of the subchondral bone andcartilage can be identied with MRI (Fig. 3). Theability to detect cartilage abnormalities can behighly dependent on the eld strength of the mag-net. Low-eld magnets are much less likely to de-tect early partial thickness cartilage injuries andsome full-thickness abnormalities. In contrast, high-eld magnets allow for a more detailed evalu-ation of the articular cartilage. Early partial thick-ness and more severe full-thickness distal edema, and microfractures. Fig. 1.

Sagittal STIR images ofthe foot showing focal severe 62 /H114082016 APPLICATIONS OF MRISoft-Tissue Abnormalities Deep Digital Flexor Tendonitis/TendonopathyInjuries of the DDFT are common and can occur insingle or multiple locations within the foot (Fig. 4).Severity, location, and type of lesions are critical todetermine the most appropriate treatment option andprognosis. The type of damage to the DDFT can bemanifested in many ways, including sagittal splits,core lesions, brillation, diffuse disease, andgeneralized enlargement. Based impres-sion, a common location for tendinosis/tendonitis is atthe proximal recess of the navicular extension into the digital flexor ten-don sheath. In addition, sagittal splits at the level ofthe navicular bone, insertional injuries at the attach- ment of the DDFT onto the palmar/plantar solar mar-gin of the cofn bone, and signicant extension oftendonitis into the digital flexor tendon sheath are alsocommon locations of damage. The severity/chronicity of lesions is largely based on the signal intensity. It is largely acceptedthat lesions with high signal intensity on proton Fig. 2. Degeneration of the navicular bone.

These supporting ligaments are com-monly injured within the foot. A denitive diagnosisof desmitis examinations alone due tothe location deep within the hoof capsule. MRI ap-pearance in desmitis of the CSL is manifested by en- largement and increased signal intensity in acutecases or low signal intensity due to brosis in morechronic cases. Many times this is accompanied byradiographic evidence of enthesopathy present on themedial and lateral proximal wings of the navicularbone. Impar ligament desmitis is also characterizedby enlargement and increased signal intensity on theMRI. In addition to enlargement many cases havetissue of intermediate signal intensity between theimpar ligament and the DDFT suggesting the pres-ence of adhesions between the ligament and theDDFT. Avulsion/marginal fragments at the origin ofthe impar ligament on the distal border of the navic-ular bone, and insertional bone edema/cysts of thecofn bone can also be present.

Lesions of the collateral ligament are dis-tinguished by enlargement and increased signal in-tensity of the ligament. A portion (proximalaspect) of the ligament can be evaluated ultrasono-graphically; however, a majority of the ligament isconned within the hoof capsule making diagnosis ofmore distal abnormalities challenging. Cystic le-sion within the third phalanx at the insertion of thecollateral ligament (collateral fossae) can occur and are characterized by increased signal intensity onall sequences.

With pos-sible proximal diffusion of local anesthetic, it ispossible to block out lameness due to injuries of thesesamoidean ligaments. Because of the propensityto block lesions more proximal than the foot, it isimperative to obtain limited MRI sequences moreproximal to include the sesamoidean ligaments,given that they are often not obtained during a rou-tine MRI examination of the foot. Lesions of thesesamoidean ligaments are characterized by en-largement and focal or diffuse areas of increasedsignal intensity within the ligament. Interpreta- tion of abnormalities of the oblique sesamoideanligaments is often difcult due to the variability insize and signal intensity of subclinical or normalsesamoidean ligaments. It is essential to havecomparative images of the contralateral sesam-oidean ligaments to aid in determining the signi-cance of abnormalities noted on the MRI. Navicular Bursitis Navicular bursitis can include simple increased fluid present within the navicular bursa or severethickening of the bursa with scar tissue and adhe-sion formation (Fig. 8). Effusion present within thenavicular bursa is characterized by an hyperintense synovial presentwithin the proximal and distal recess of the bursa.The exact cause of the increase in fluid is unknown;however, in many cases there is concurrent navicu-lar bone edema. In most cases, effusion is easilymanageable and can be transient. In contrast, pro-liferative bursitis seems to occur in more chroniccases of navicular bursitis. It is speculated thatpersistent inflammation of the bursa causes prolif-eration of tissue of intermediate signal intensity andthickening of the bursal wall leading to the develop-ment of adhesions and proliferative the proximal bursa.Proliferative bursitis is more difcult to manage andsometimes requires more aggressive treatment. Laminar Abnormalities MRI provides excellent detail regarding the sensi- tive and insensitive lamina of the foot (Fig. 9).This allows the early diagnosis and intervention ofkeratomas, acute laminitis, laminar separation,helping to prevent progression of disease. Therapeutic Approaches Following and Accurate MRI Diagnosis Deep Digital Flexor Tendonitis/Tendonopathy Injuries to the DDFT within the foot are one of the most common pathologic conditions diagnosed withMRI. As discussed previously, there are many fac-tors to consider when determining appropriatetreatment regimens for injuries of the DDFT. Ma-jor factors that determine treatment and prognosisinclude duration (acute vs chronic), type (core le-sions, diffuse disease, and sagittal splits), location,and severity of injury to the DDFT. In addition totreatments described below, the primary treatmentrecommendation for many soft-tissue injuries is arest and rehabilitation program to allow time for thetendon or ligament to heal, in addition to a recom-mended therapeutic shoeing protocol. Biologic Therapies Recently, the use of biologics in the treatment of tendon and ligament injuries has become well ac-cepted and very popular. Currently, the most pop- Fig. 7.

It is generally accepted that biologictreatments are typically administered by direct in-tralesional injection, local regional limb perfusion,or a combination of the two methods. Althoughthese methods are widely accepted and used intreatment of equine musculoskeletal injuries, thereare still many unanswered questions about their mechanism of action, duration of action, andefcacy. Acute core lesions present within the DDFT can be treated by direct injection of biologics under ul-trasonographic guidance. Direct intralesional in-jection relies on the ability to observe the lesionsunder ultrasonographic guidance, but are somewhatlimited to locations proximal to the navicular bursa.As lesions progress more distal within the foot, di-rect injection becomes more difcult. Guided place-ment of needles into acute core lesions is reportedunder computed tomography (CT) guidance. Ra-diographic guidance is also that the biologic is administered directly intothe lesion is questionable. 27In cases of direct com - munication with synovial structures, biologics canbe administered via synovial injections. In diffuse injuries to tendons or ligaments and lesions located distal to the navicular bursa, re-gional limb perfusions of BM-MSCs gaining pop-ularity. This relies on the BM-MSCs ability tohome to areas of active inflammation or injury. In addition to the use of biologics, other medical and surgical treatments are described below for thetreatment of soft-tissue injuries within the foot. Collateral Ligament Desmitis of the Distal Interphalangeal Joint There are a wide range of treatment options for collateral ligament injuries. The primary treat-ment recommendation for collateral ligament inju-ries is a rest and rehabilitation program to allowtime for the ligaments to heal. Additional thera- Fig. 8. Bursitis.

Directinjection of the entire collateral ligament is typicallyperformed under radiographic guidance. 28Osse - ous abnormalities at the origin and insertion of thecollateral ligament are common. 17Development of cysts at the origin and insertion of the collateral ligaments may require additional surgical thera-pies. Invasion and curettage of the cyst the navicular treatment tool in pathologic condi-tions of the navicular bursa following an MRI diag-nosis. There are two surgical approaches to thenavicular bursa in the horse. Surgical approachesfor navicular bursoscopy include a direct approachand a transthecal approach in which the bursa isentered through the tendon sheath following resec-tion of the T-ligament. 29The author prefers the transthecal approach unless there is suspected or conrmed sepsis of the navicular bursa. The tran-sthecal approach to the navicular examination of the digital flexor tendon sheathand in many cases can aid in tenoscopic guidedinjection of biologics at the time of surgery. 30In cases of septic navicular bursitis the direct approachis preferred to prevent contamination of systemic antibiotics, and in somecases development of distal drainage if the bursawas invaded through a tract in the frog or solarsurface of the foot. 29 Non-septic pathologic conditions that are com- monly treated with navicular bursoscopy includesaggital splits within the DDFT at the level of thenavicular bone, dorsal margin abrasions/tearing/fraying of the DDFT at recurrentnavicular bursitis, and erosive lesions on the pal-mar/plantar surface of the navicular bone. 29,30 A majority of conditions treated within the navicularbursa are associated with injuries to the soft tissuesin close association to the navicular bursa. Injuriesto these soft tissue structures require resection ordebridement of the affected tissue. In some cases,there is subsequent damage to the palmar/plantarbrocartilage of the navicular bone that requiresdebridement. The rationale for debridement of le-sions within the navicular bursa is based on clinicalobservations that tendon injuries with synovial com-munication do not heal well. The inability of theDDFT to heal is likely multifactorial. Ingress ofsynovial fluid has the potential to decrease the abil-ity to create a scar of the affected area thereby decreasing the ability to contain the intrinsic cofac-tors required to promote healing. In addition, theproportion of exposed disrupted collagen within asynovial cavity can causes persistent inflammationand lameness that has a direct correlation with theseverity of synovitis present within the navicularbursa. In addition, tendons conned within a sy-novial structure rely heavily on intrinsic healing.Debridement of these damaged bers is thought tostimulate the intrinsic healing mechanism. A re-cent study reports favorable outcomes following bur-soscopy for the treatment of numerous pathologicconditions of the navicular bursa. In this report of114 horses, 63% of horses that underwent navicularbursoscopy were sound and in work and 37% ofthese horses were performing at a level of equalor greater than that achieved before surgery. 31 Horses in the study with extensive tearing of theDDFT and combined injuries to the navicular boneand DDFT were less likely to be sound comparedwith horses with only small tears of the DDFT.Outcomes following surgical debridement of tendonlesions compares favorably to medical managementalone reported in other studies. 31 Tenoscopy of the Digital Flexor Tendon Sheath Injuries of soft tissue structures conned within the digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) are commonlydiagnosed with MRI following resolution PDNB. and desmitis of theDDFT, - tive scar-tissue adhesions spanning from the ten-dons to the tendon sheath are also common ndings.Tenoscopy is indicated in cases in which there isproliferative tissue within the DFTS, adhesion for-mation between signicant enlargement of the DDALthat requires desmotomy. At the time of tenoscopicevaluation if there is concurrent tendonitis/desmitis,tenoscopic-guided injections of biologics can beperformed. Cofn Joint Arthroscopy Pathologic conditions that warrant arthroscopy of the cofn joint are limited to subchondral bone, ar-ticular cartilage abnormalities, and surgical trans-action of the of navicular bone. Commonlesions debrided are subchondralcysts and articular cartilage located distance from the extensor process toallow adequate accessibility. 32When surgical de - bridement is not possible, medical managementwith intrasynovial therapies are the treatment ofchoice. Options for medical management includeautologous conditioned serum, BM-MSCs, and cor-ticosteroids. In addition, enlargement of the CSLof navicular bone is a common MRI diagnosis.When CSL desmitis is the sole abnormality noted,horses are placed in rest and a rehabilitation pro- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 145IN-DEPTH: CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF MRIgram to allow time for the ligament to heal. Ifresolution of the CSL does not occur, arthroscopictransaction of the ligament is warranted. 33 Navicular Bursa InjectionsPreviously, injection of the navicular bursa with hyaluronic acid had been reservedfor cases of lameness that did not respond to thera-peutic shoeing, administration of NSAIDs, or injec-tions interphalangealjoint. More recently, navicular bursa injectionshave become a rst line of medical treatment afterMRI has revealed a pathologic change in the bursaor within close proximity. Medical management ofthe navicular bursa can be used to continue horsesin work or to reduce the inflammation associatedwith acute pathologic changes followed by place-ment of horses into a rest and rehabilitation pro-gram. Currently, the author's approach totreatment of horses with pathology localized to thenavicular bursa region is highly dependent on thelesion present. 1. Horses with acute core lesions present within the proximal navicular bursa, over the palmar/plan-tar aspect of the navicular bone, and insertional coreDDFT injuries: If there is no of the navicular with cortico-steroids acetate) and hyal-uronic acid. Following injections, the horses areshod with therapeutic shoes and placed in a rest andrehabilitation program to allow time for the tendonto heal. 2. Horses with sagittal splits of the DDFT or tears that communicate with synovial fluid: Mostsagittal splits within the tendon have a communica-tion with the bursa that allows ingress of synovialfluid into the tendon injury. One approach to treat-ment is injection of BM-MSCs directly into the na-vicular bursa. The second approach to treatment isintrabursal injection of corticosteroids (triamcino-lone acetonide) and hyaluronic acid. Following in-jections, the horses are shod with therapeutic shoesand placed in a rest and rehabilitation program.The author prefers triamcinolone acetonide whenthere is a direct communication of synovial fluid andtendon tissue as there are some potential deleteri-ous effects of certain corticosteroids within the ten-don tissue. 3. Horses with scar tissue/adhesions within the proximal recess of the navicular bursa. The authorprefers to treat these horses with injections of corti-costeroids and hyaluronan if navicular bursoscopy isnot an option. In an attempt to break down some ofthe scar tissue and adhesions, the navicular bursamay be injected with 4-5 mL (40-50 mg) of hyal-uronic acid to create volume distention and highpressure within the bursa. Creating fluid pressurein the bursa may break down some of the restrictivescar tissue and increase relative movement of theDDFT through the proximal aspect of the navicular bursa. 4. bursitis can sometimes resolve with a one-timeinjection; however, some horses continually developbursitis that requires repeated injections. Somehorses that require frequent injections warrant na-vicular bursoscopy and resection of the T-ligamentso that a direct communication between the tendonsheath and navicular bursa is obtained. Develop-ment of a direct communication allows treatment(less invasive than continued navicular bursa injec-tions) of the tendon sheath and subsequent treat-ment of the bursa due to the establishedcommunication. 5. Horses with multiple abnormalities (i.e., flexor cortical erosions and concurrent soft tissueinjuries within the DDFT): In most cases thesehorses are treated with intrabursal injections of cor-ticosteroids and hyaluronic acid. Many times thesehorses are continued in work unless there is evi-dence of an acute soft tissue injury that would re-quire a rest-and-rehabilitation program. A recent study evaluating the efcacy of navicular bursa injections in horses with navicular syndromedemonstrated that response was highly dependenton the disease process detected on MRI and theduration of lameness. In this study, 70% of horseswith deep digital flexor (DDF) tendonitis were ableto return to their intended use for a mean of 14months and 50% were still sound at the time offollow-up. This compares favorably to other stud-ies in which return to soundness in DDF tendonitisranges from 20 to 75%; however, in the currentstudy a large portion of horses were diagnosed withacute tendonitis. Horses with chronic soft-tissueinjuries (/H110226 mo) or multiple abnormalities had a variable and poorer prognosis than horses withacute injuries. 34 Intrathecal Injections of the Digital Flexor TendonSheath Injections of the digital flexor tendon sheath can be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.There are relatively few structures conned withinthe digital flexor tendon and sesamoidean liga-ments, and DDAL). In many cases of lamenesslocalized to the foot there are multiple soft tissueinjuries present on the MRI examination. The dif-cult question is which pathologic abnormality iscontributing most to the current lameness? Localintrathecal anesthesia of the DFTS can be used ifthere is suspected pathology that is conned withinthe sheath. Injection of local anesthesia into theDFTS will lameness associated with inju-ries of sesamoidean ligaments, /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF MRIand DDAL. If the horse responds favorably to localanesthesia of the DFTS, medical or surgical therapyof the sheath is indicated. Therapy can consist ofdirect intralesional injection with biologics intothe tendon or ligament affected or injection of corti-sone and hyaluronan into the DFTS. As indicatedabove in treatment of DDFT injuries most injuries tothe soft-tissue structures within the DFTS also re-quire a rest-and-rehabilitation program to allowtime for the tendon or ligament to heal. In someinstances, restrictive scar tissue adhesions or en-largement of the DDAL can be a source of lamenessin the sheath that can require tenoscopy for resec-tion of adhesions or release of the DDAL.Distal Interphalangeal Joint InjectionsIntra-articular injections of the distal interphalan-geal joint are commonly performed in the treatmentof lameness localized to the foot. In many cases,MRI is able to identify abnormalities of the cartilageor underlying subchondral bone within the distaland proximal interphalangeal joint that are surgi-cally inaccessible. In these cases, injection ofcorticosteroids or biologics can be performed to ame-liorate lameness and continue horses inwork. Prognosis is highly variable depending onthe severity and location of the underlying pathol-ogy. For treatment of navicular bone edema, a rou-tine with corticosteroids and aperiod of rest ( /H1101160-90 d) is often all that is needed for complete resolution of bone edema. Palmar/Plantar Digital Neurectomy Palmar/plantar digital neurectomies have been a mainstay in treatment of foot pain that is nonre-sponsive to conventional therapies. Prognosis andefcacy following neurectomies has been highlyvariable. Much of this variability is likely due tothe inability to effectively determine pathologywithin the foot prior to performing the procedure.MRI can help to better determine good candidatesfor the procedure. Horses with severe injury to thesoft tissues within the foot (DDFT, collateral liga-ment) and erosions on the flexor cortical surface ofthe navicular bone are poor candidates for surgery.Typically, if there is signicant injury to the softtissues within the foot, horses are placed in an ex-tended rest-and-rehabilitation program prior to con-sidering neurectomy as a surgical option. If horseswith severe soft-tissue damage are allowed theappropriate amount of time to heal there is likelyless chance for catastrophic injury if a neurectomyis performed in the future. In contrast, somehorses with mild pathology of the navicular bonethat is nonresponsive to medical treatments canhave a positive outcome following neurectomy. 3. Conclusion With the advent of MRI, it is evident that horsesthat were once classied into a single clinical diag-nosis can have very different pathologic conditionswithin the foot. Medical and operating approaches to foot-related lameness vary greatly depending onstructures affected within the complex anatomy ofthe foot. The ability to target treatments based onan accurate MRI diagnosis will continue to allowveterinarians to develop a more accurate prognosisand outcome.

Introduction Endocrine diagnostic tests are useful for evaluatingmany reproductive conditions in the mare. Whetherconsidering either an open mare or a pregnant mare, anumber of hormones can be used to evaluate overall reproductive health or wellbeing of a pregnancy.Although some of these tests have been in use formany decades and others were recently developed,there are still a number of tests that are being de-veloped and have great potential as diagnosticmarkers. Endocrinology has the obvious advan-tage of aiding diagnoses without requiring expen-sive equipment or spending too much time. Allthat is necessary to obtain an endocrine diagnosis isto collect a blood sample and send it to one of manyclinical laboratories along with a brief history for thecase. Some of these tests will provide a denitivediagnosis, but some tests will be inconclusive andtherefore in frustration for veterinarians and theirclients. However, such tests are sometimes incon-clusive because they were not appropriately selectedor because the blood sample was collected outside ofthe appropriate timeframe for that test. The scopeof this paper is to describe which tests are adequatefor each condition and when those tests are usefulfor evaluating the reproductive health of the mare.The discussion will also include some aspects of the main laboratory techniques used to measure thesereproductive hormones, their limitations, and thedirections clinical endocrinology will be moving inthe near future. Subfertility in the mare is a multifactorial dis- ease and is often dened as a mare that does notconceive easily or that has trouble carrying foalsto term. However, there is often a ne line be-tween fertile and subfertile mares and betweensubfertile and infertile mares. A number of con-ditions or circumstances associated with subfertil-ity are related to the age of the mare, toabnormalities of the anatomy in their reproduc-tive tract, or to mares prone to uterine infectionsand in some cases to specic hormonal imbalancesor deciencies. Often, a number of these condi-tions will overlap and it will be difcult or nearlyimpossible to elucidate the primary cause for thereproductive failure. There is an intrinsic dif-culty when assessing a subfertile mare, given thatthese mares are usually affected by a number ofdifferent conditions and do not have consistentendocrine proles. However, endocrine prolesare well characterized in the fertile mare and canbe used when evaluating a subfertile mare. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. SUB-FERTILE MARE NOTES2. Progestogens Progestogens are a class of steroid thatare synthesized by the corpus luteum (CL) duringthe luteal phase and early stages of pregnancy, andby the fetoplacental unit during mid and late gesta-tion. 1The role of progestogens, also known as pro - gestagens, is to switch the luminal and glandularepithelium from a proliferative state to a secretorystate, and to maintain uterine quiescence; in otherwords, to help sustain and nourish the embryo orfetus. There are at least 10 known progestogenspresent in maternal circulation at some point duringgestation 1with the potential for even more. How - ever, to date only a few of them are known to bebioactive: these are progesterone (P4), 5 /H9251-dihydro- progesterone (5 /H9251-DHP),2,3and to some extent allo - pregnanolone.4Other progestogens might also be bioactive or might simply be metabolites present in circulation. Progesterone is the most renowned and studied of this class of steroid hormones. Progesterone con-centration in the mare starts to increase immedi-ately after ovulation and is produced by the primaryCL. If there is an embryo present in the uterus andmaternal recognition of pregnancy occurs, the lifespan of that CL will extend beyond the normallength of diestrus and P4 concentrations will remainelevated. 5During early pregnancy, there will be a second increase in P4 concentrations, which is asso- ciated with equine chorionic gonadotropin. is rst detectable in circulation at ap-proximately days 35-40 of gestation and has a dou-ble effect in the P4 prole: rst through directluteotrophic stimulation of the primary Cl, and sec-ond through the formation of secondary corporalutea. Due to this second increase in P4, circulat-ing levels continue to increase, peaking betweendays 60 and 120 of gestation. From that point on,P4 slowly decreases until being nearly undetectableat approximately days 180 to 200 days of gesta-tion. 1,6Other progestogens are simultaneously produced by the fetoplacental unit and are rst de- tectable by day 60 of gestation. The sole productionof progestogens by the fetoplacental units is com-pletely capable of maintaining pregnancy at approx-imately days 120 to 140 of gestation, as shownthrough ovariectomy studies. 5,7 From a diagnostic perspective, circulating P4 has been used to evaluate luteal function during earlypregnancy. In the literature, when circulating P4is greater than 1 ng/mL, it is considered consistentwith the presence of luteal tissue, that apreovulatory follicle has ovulated, luteinized, P4. When circulating levels are greaterthan 4 ng/mL, they are considered adequate for themaintenance and support of pregnancy 5,8; however, this level may vary depending on the referenceranges used by the clinical laboratory where P4 wasassayed. There are few reports in the literature orin anecdotal cases of mares suffering primarily fromluteal insufciency. 9However, there are other rea - sons for monitoring and supplementing endogenousP4 with progestins (synthetic form of P4) duringpregnancy, such as mares suspect of compromisedpregnancies due to uterine infections, previous his-tory of pregnancy loss, inadvertent administrationof prostaglandins, and a number of other clinicalreasons. 1During late gestation, there are also a number of reasons to supplement endogenous prog- estogens; however, monitoring based upon currentstandard immunoassays does not provide usefulclinical information due to lack of specicity in thelaboratory techniques. There are a few important issues regarding labo- ratory techniques and progestogens that requireclarication. To date, all clinical veterinary diag-nostic laboratories use immunoassays to measurecirculating progesterone. Whether radio-immuno-assays or enzyme-immunoassays, the specicity ofthese tests is limited by the antibodies used in theseassays. Their specicity depends on the antigen orepitope with which the antibody is designed to im-munoreact. Therefore, if that epitope or antigen ispresent in other molecules, that antibody is unableto differentiate between those molecules and willgive false or inaccurate results. When it comes tolate gestation in the mare, there is a great variety ofprogestogens circulating in large quantities, whichmakes immunoassays unreliable to evaluate any ofthem. In addition to this lack of specicity, differ-ent antibodies will result in disparate amounts ofcross reactivity; therefore, each P4 assay will mea-sure different amounts of progestogens, producingdistinct results. 10It is important to emphasize that best clinical interpretation for any P4 result is the one provided by the clinical laboratory that mea-sured that P4, given that they should have normalreference ranges for that specic assay. The specicity lacking in immunoassays and the inter-laboratory variations can be overcome with theuse of the much more specic liquid chromatogra-phy-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Using LC-MS,researchers have been able to evaluate changes indifferent progestogens during late gestation, 6and there are current efforts to elucidate links between placental compromise during late gestation and thechanges associated with specic progestogens. 11,12 It would be advantageous for clinical laboratories toswitch to LC-MS to provide diagnostic panels thatwould yield greater specicity and a wider array ofprogestogens evaluated. In summary, current tests for P4 in the mare are useful to evaluate the presence of luteal tissue(P4/H110221ng/mL) and to ensure that levels of circulating P4 are adequate for maintenance of early pregnancy(P4/H110224 ng/mL) until approximately 120 days of gestation. 3. Estrogens Estrogens are also a useful diagnostic aid to evalu-ate reproductive status of the mare. Similar to pro- 150 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MAREgestogens, estrogens are a class of steroids that aresynthesized the ovary and the fetoplacental unitby aromatization of well-renowned and studied is 17 /H9252-estra- diol, which is key in the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and in driving behavioral andreproductive aspects during estrus. There are present in cir- culation during different stages of pregnancy in themare. 14 As with progestogens, the current standard labora- tory techniques used to measure circulating levels ofestrogens are also immunoassays. Therefore, all ofthe precautions previously described for progestogensshould be still taken into consideration. There arenevertheless several circumstances in which estrogensare useful diagnostic tools. To briefly summarize es-trogen physiology, estradiol peaks during estrus.Estradiol is synthesized in the ovaries by large folliclesand peaks in circulation during estrus, having a posi-tive feedback effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-go-nadal axis that leads to an increase of luteinizinghormone (LH) and ultimately to ovulation. Duringthis phase, estradiol also drives an important behav-ioral component, usually described as estrus behavior.It is noteworthy that this well-described \"peak\" of es-tradiol during estrus actually represents a very smallquantitative increase of short duration. Therefore,even though control studies are able to differentiatebetween estrus and diestrus concentrations with dailysamples, it is in most cases difcult to determine thephase of the estrous cycle in non-pregnant mares us-ing estradiol in a clinical setting. Currently, the best diagnostic use of estrogens in equine reproduction is that of estrone sulfate (ES)during pregnancy. There is a measurable increasein ES synthesized by the CL 15and associated with the increase in equine chorionic gonadotropin that occurs at approximately days 35-40 of gestation.14 This increase in ES is rst detectable in circulationafter day 45 in standard-sized horses, with levelsgreater than 6 ng/mL in pregnant mares. The cir-culating levels of ES continue to increase from thispoint on, due to production by the CL and also laterduring gestation by the feto-placental unit. ES re-mains elevated throughout gestation, peaking at ap-proximately days 150-180 and slowly declining asparturition approaches. 14Therefore, ES is a useful diagnostic tool for pregnancy from approximately day 45 until near term. If the timing of the diag-nosis is not critical, testing a week or a few weeksafter 45 days of gestation will certainly provide adenitive diagnosis. The only exception to this ruleis miniature horses. Minis have a higher baselinelevel of ES and the peak seems to be later in gesta-tion. Therefore, the recommended window for min-iature horses is after 80 days of gestation and ESmust be greater than 60 ng/mL to be consistent withpregnancy (http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/phr/ labs/endolab/index.cfm). Finally, estrogens have also been used as a mea- sure of fetal wellbeing and/or placental health.The rationale for this use comes from the fact thatduring mid and late gestation estrogen precursorsare synthesized by the fetal gonads and the aroma-tization to estrogens occurs in the fetoplacental unit.Therefore, a healthy fetus and placenta are neces-sary for adequate estrogen production. In additionto this hypothesis, estrogens decrease rapidly afterinduction of abortion with prostaglandins 16and eld studies also suggest that circulating concentration of estrogens are reduced in mares affected by pla-centitis. 15However, more research is necessary in this eld using LC-MS technology to elucidate the changing patterns of steroids during late gestationin the mare, as previous research is based in immu-noassays that evaluate total estrogens instead ofspecic estrogens. Recent data using LC-MS foundan association between experimentally induced pla- centitis and a decrease in circulating 17 /H9252-estradiol sulfate.17 In summary, current testing for estrogens is use- ful to diagnose pregnancy after 45 days of gestation(ES/H110226 ng/mL) in standard size horses and after 80 days of gestation (ES /H1102260 ng/mL) in is the most recent endocrine marker developed into a di-agnostic tool for equine reproduction. In the lastdecade, several scientic studies have establishedseveral diagnostic uses of AMH in both males 18and females.19For males, AMH has advantages over testosterone and ES in the diagnosis of cryptorchid- ism.20For mares, AMH has been proposed as an endocrine test with a number of useful diagnostic capabilities. It was rst proposed as a replacementor a complement to the granulosa cell tumor(GCT) 21-23panel that included inhibin, testosterone, and P4. In GCTs there is a hormonal component that leads to an increase in inhibin ( /H110220.7 ng/mL) a n of P4 ( /H110210.5 ng/mL). However, as with most diagnostic toolsthere is rarely complete agreement among all pa-rameters; levels are marginally outside the normalranges and/or they can be confounded by other con-ditions. According to the literature, the sensitivityof these endocrine markers is as follows: inhibin iselevated in approximately 80-87% of tumors, andtestosterone in approximately 48-54% of tumors. 22 In addition to the sensitivity of these tests, they arealso confounded by the fact that both hormones havebeen reported to be elevated during pregnancy in themare. AMH offers greater sensitivity, with and is not confounded by pregnancy asAMH remains relatively stable in circulation re- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 151HOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MAREgardless of circadian rhythms, seasonal changes,and pregnancy status. 23 In addition to the diagnostic use of AMH in GCTs, there is a new and unique diagnostic use of AMH forthe mare. As in other species, AMH proves to be adiagnostic marker to predict ovarian follicular re-serves. AMH in the mare is expressed in pre-an-tral and antral follicles in the ovary, with theexception of primordial follicles and antral folliclesgreater than 30 mm in diameter. 24AMH plays an important role by inhibiting the recruitment of pri- mordial follicles into follicular waves. As a the addition, both AMH and antral reflection of the number of mordial follicles and therefore of the follicular re-serve. 24Furthermore, in human medicine AMH has also been shown to have some predictive ability for the fertility of older women.25-27This has not yet been shown in the horse, but is another potential use of AMH for the mare, given that the importanceof follicular reserves might play an important role asa predictor of fertility especially in older mares. 5. Equine Metabolic Syndrome and Pituitary are two endo-crine dysfunctions that affect reproduction. Thereis a relatively small amount of scientic literatureregarding the effects of EMS or PPID on reproduc-tion, yet both seem to negatively affect the reproduc-tive health of the mare. EMS mares exhibit alteredreproductive cyclicity, with loss of the seasonal an-ovulatory period 28and prolongation of the inter - interovulatory periods and luteal phases.29Mares with PPID often suffer from persistent uterine in- fections, cycle irregularities, and difculties carrying healthy foals to term.30From an endocrine perspec - tive these conditions tend to overlap.31Horses with EMS have insulin resistance (IR) characterized by hy- perinsulinemia and anecdotally develop PPID. PPIDhorses can also be affected by insulin resistance butare characterized by increased adrenocorticotropichormone (ACTH). In addition to clinical signs such as general or regional adiposity and a history of or predisposi-tion to laminitis, horses with EMS can be diag-nosed endocrinologically based on elevated insulinconcentrations after an overnight fasting period.Thresholds delineating hyperinsulinemia arereached when insulin concentrations are greaterthan 20 /H9262IU/mL.31In addition, dynamic testing for evaluation of insulin sensitivity can be per- formed with an oral sugar test by collecting abasal blood sample, followed by oral corn syrup,followed by a second blood sample 60 minutesafter the syrup administration (post sample insu-lin/H1102260 /H9262IU/mL in horses with EMS). For horses with PPID, determination of circulatingACTH alone can be diagnostic (ACTH /H1102235 pg/mL;there are seasonal variations and seasonally ad- justed ranges); however, a thyrotropin-releasinghormone (TRH) stimulation test seems to be moresensitive for the horses with an early onset of thedisease. In case of a TRH stimulation test, abasal blood sample is followed by TRH (IV injec-tion of TRH, 1 mg/mL) and a second blood sampleis collected 10 after the TRH administra-tion (post-TRH ACTH level /H11022110 pg/mL regional adipos-ity and/or predisposition for laminitis are clinicalsigns sometimes present in both endocrine disor-ders, it is recommended to test for both endocrinedisorders when trying to accurately diagnose EMSand/or PPID. 6. Conclusion Endocrine markers are useful diagnostic tools whenevaluating the reproductive status of the mare.There are well established uses for P4, ES, andAMH for the mare. Reproductive endocrinology isstill an active eld of research as new technologybecomes available. Current research is focused ondeveloping new diagnostic markers for fertility andfor early markers of disease, especially during latepregnancy in the mare given that placentitis is stilla devastating loss to the industry. Currently dif-ferent steroids and miRNAs are being evaluated asdiagnostic tools and have promising utility as newtechnology is available for researchers (LC-MS forsteroids and RNA sequencing for miRNAs). It isvery important, however, to understand the currentlimitations and adequate uses of the diagnosticmarkers. The inherent variations that endocrinemarkers are subject to among individual horses andthe different assays used by different laboratoriesare particularly signicant. It is always recom-mended to refer to the preferred clinical laboratoryfor advice regarding the adequate test, timing foreach test, proper sample to obtain, and the best wayto handle it to prepare for shipping, as they will bethe ones interpreting the results within their refer-ence ranges and with knowledge of each test'slimitations.

Introduction The main methods for assisted reproduction applica-ble to management of the sub-fertile mare currentlyare intracytoplasmic sperm (ICSI), oocytetransfer (OT), and cloning. ICSI and OT requireoocytes to be collected from the donor mare. ForICSI, practitioners typically harvest oocytes from do-nor mares at their practice and then ship the oocytes toa laboratory equipped to perform the oocyte matura-tion, sperm injection, and embryo culture procedures.The resulting embryos may be shipped back to thepractitioner for transfer or may be transferred at theICSI facility. Oocyte transfer\u2014the surgical transferof a mature oocyte to the oviduct of an inseminatedrecipient mare\u2014is a procedure that the practitionermay perform entirely within their practice. Thistechnique offers a method for production of foals fromsub-fertile mares via assisted reproduction if there areno ICSI facilities available. Cloning is applicable ifthe sub-fertile mare does not produce viable oocytesdue to age or ovarian disease; the cloned lly resultingfrom the procedure can then be bred to yield foals. 2. Materials and Methods Detailed methods for the procedures used for theassisted reproduction techniques given above havebeen presented at AAEP previously. 1These in- clude methods for: Recovery of in-vivo matured oocytes from the dominant stimulated follicle via aspirationthrough the flank Handling of in vivo-matured oocytes for ship- ment to the laboratory Recovery of oocytes via transvaginal ultra- sound-guided follicle aspiration (TVA) Handling of immature oocytes for shipment to the laboratory Oocyte transfer Tissue collection for nuclear transfer (cloning) This how-to paper will go over some of the factors to be weighed when thinking of managing a sub-fertilemare using assisted reproduction. Basic parame-ters of ICSI, OT, and cloning to keep in mind whenmaking clinical decisions to use these techniques areas follows: ICSI The ICSI Laboratory Effective equine ICSI laboratories are only available in some countries; thus, ICSI may not be a possibil- 154 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MARE NOTESity for some practices. It is a huge undertaking toattempt to set up an equine ICSI laboratory, andeven when set up, new laboratories are often notsuccessful. If an effective laboratory is available,my strong suggestion is to ship oocytes to that lab-oratory; if no ICSI laboratory is available, considershipping oocytes internationally, performing OT, orrecommending cloning. International shipment of immature oocytes is a relatively simple procedure. Oocytes are placed ina suitable passive insulated device a, set up at room temperature,1and shipped via a standard overnight delivery service. Typically, international shipmentby a delivery service will take 2 days. At TexasA&M, we have had good blastocyst rates with re-search oocytes shipped from France, with a ship-ment time of approximately 50 hours. However, ifresulting embryos are to be transferred for preg-nancy, the health regulations can be complex. In-ternational oocyte shipment requires meeting thesame regulations set up for import of semen andembryos into the country in which the laboratory isestablished, and thus often quarantine and testingof the donor mare is necessary for each oocyte har-vest. For the United States, a new import permit isneeded for each shipment. When choosing an ICSI laboratory to which to send oocytes, the practitioner should ask what thelaboratory's success rate is in terms of percentage ofblastocysts achieved per injected oocyte and the on-going pregnancy rate (with heartbeat) after trans-fer. It would also be good to know the numbers ofICSI cases performed (one case referring to all theoocytes collected from one mare in one session).Currently, there are only a few laboratories in theworld that have published effective equine ICSI re-sults (i.e., /H1102225% blastocysts per injected oocyte and stallions); othersreport good rates anecdotally. The efciency de-creases when clinical work is performed, due tomare age, cause of subfertility, and variation insperm quality\u2014the rate of blastocyst developmentper injected oocyte can be much lower depending ontype of clinical caseload, and still be clinically useful. Now that ICSI is becoming more accepted as a technique for equine clinical reproduction, manylarger equine reproduction centers are attempting toestablish this technique. Remember that anyonewith the capability of injecting a sperm into an eggwith a micromanipulator can say that they are doingICSI, but the important thing is whether a viableembryo results from the procedure. For some rea-son, production of embryos for equine ICSI seems tobe more difcult, or at least technically different,than that for other species. Technicians experi-enced in human ICSI may produce no blastocystswhen performing equine ICSI.Oocyte Recovery and Shipment for ICSIICSI is more efcient when immature oocytes arerecovered from all immature follicles present on themares' ovaries, followed by in vitro maturation of the recovered oocytes. The practitioner shouldstrive to attain a 50% or greater oocyte recovery rateon transvaginal aspiration of immature follicles, as-pirating all follicles greater than 5 mm in diameter.This typically results (in Quarter-type mares) inaspiration of approximately 12 follicles and recoveryof approximately six oocytes per aspiration session,of which four oocytes undergo successful maturationin vitro with subsequent ICSI. If only the domi-nant stimulated preovulatory follicle is aspirated,recovery rates are approximately follow the preovulatory follicle and stim-ulate it, then during the TVA session recover oocytesfrom both the preovulatory follicle and the subordi-nate follicles present on the ovary. Interestingly,there seems to be no effect of this timing, eitherpositive or negative, on the developmental compe-tence of immature oocytes from subordinate follicleswhen compared with aspirating immature folliclesduring diestrus. Although the above \"combined\" approach yields both quantity (the immature oocytes) and quality(the preovulatory oocyte), the two kinds of oocytesare ready for fertilization at different times. Thisrequires ICSI to be performed at two separate times,and thus the expense to the client is increased andthe return from ICSI of the one preovulatory oocyteis low. In clinical mares at Texas A&M, our blas-tocyst rate for in vivo-matured oocytes from thedominant stimulated follicle is only slightly higherthan that for in vitro-matured oocytes (38 vs 23%,respectively per injected oocyte), thus in our hands,the increase in viability of the preovulatory oocytedoes not make up for the fact that only one oocyte isavailable. Immature oocytes can be shipped at room temper- ature by overnight courier, as noted above. In con-trast, the maturing oocyte from the stimulatedpreovulatory follicle must be shipped in culture me-dium in a portable incubator; we try to keep thetemperature between 37 and 38.2 oC. Some airlines do not want to accept active devices and so such incubators may have to be transported by car. Recovery of oocytes from immature follicles can be performed on a set schedule (i.e., once every 14 d),without checking the mare in between. 2At Texas A&M, because each recovered oocyte involves 12 days of monitoring and handling as it progressesthrough maturation, ICSI, and embryo develop-ment, we perform TVA on Mondays, Tuesdays, andWednesdays so that ICSI is performed on Wednes-days, Thursdays and Fridays. The weekends in-volve embryo evaluation, handling, and shipmentonly. In contrast, recovery of the maturing oocytefrom the dominant stimulated follicle requires ex-amining mares repeatedly to monitor follicle activityand evaluate the size and appearance of the preovu-latory follicle, timing gonadotropin stimulation ofthe dominant time after gonadotropin administration. Typi-cally, the gonadotropin stimulation is given on theday that the dominant follicle reaches receptive di-ameter (based on mare history or typical receptivesize for breed) or appearance on ultrasonography.A workable schedule is to give the gonadotropinstimulus in the afternoon of Day 1, aspirate thefollicle 24-28 hours later on the afternoon of Day 2,and immediately ship the oocyte by courier to thelaboratory where it is subjected to ICSI the morningof Day 3. These steps are difcult to organize to aset schedule and so may result in oocytes beingrecovered when a laboratory will not receive them orwhen they may result in signicant after-hourscharges for handling and micromanipulation. Although the above drawbacks exist for utilization of the dominant stimulated follicle, oocyte recoveryfrom this follicle is much easier and initially morerewarding than is aspiration of immature follicles,so practices just starting oocyte recovery may wantto start by performing preovulatory follicularaspiration. Oocyte Transfer Because OT involves standing flank laparotomy on arecipient mare, it is best conducted when a singleoocyte of high viability is available. Thus, OT ismost suitable for use with the in vivo-maturedoocyte recovered from the dominant stimulatedfollicle. 3 It is possible to use OT with multiple in vitro- matured oocytes (such as after collection of imma-ture oocytes from TVA of all immature follicles, orrecovery post-mortem); 4however, the pregnancy rate per oocyte transferred is very low because: 1) the maturation status of the oocytes is unknownat the time of transfer (the cumulus is left on so thatthe oocytes will \"stick\" in the oviduct, thus stagingthe meiotic status by viewing the polar body is notpossible), and 2) the developmental competence of invitro-matured oocytes is lower than that for in vivo-matured oocytes recovered from the stimulated pre-ovulatory follicle. In my opinion in the case ofmultiple oocytes, it is best to transfer all oocytes(maximum, 12 per oviduct) to one or two recipientmare(s), then to flush the uterus for embryo recov-ery\u2014this has been performed successfully 9-10days after OT in a commercial program 5\u2014and per - form standard embryo transfer (ET) to secondaryrecipients with any recovered blastocysts. This hasthe drawback of potential inefciencies at uterineflush and at ET, but is preferable to trying to per-form a surgery for each of multiple oocytes, with alow chance of pregnancy per surgery. All procedures for OT are workable within a well- equipped practice. Oocytes may be recovered fromthe stimulated preovulatory follicle with a needleplaced through the flank, 1eliminating the need to purchase and learn to use a TVA system. Recovery rates with this system are similar to those withtransvaginal aspiration. 5,6If the oocyte is har -vested close to the time of ovulation, it can be held for a few hours without a CO2incubator or need for gassing, if medium with a nonbicarbonate buffer system such as in M199 with Hanks' salts with 10%fetal bovine serum (FBS), is used. The oocyte maybe placed in this medium in a capped tube in a waterbath. The transfer procedure is straightforward 5,6 and is performed via standing flank laparotomy. The OT process is robust; within broad limits there is little effect of variation in factors such astime from donor gonadotropin administration to fol-licle aspiration, time from oocyte recovery to trans-fer, or time of recipient follicle aspiration in relationto insemination or transfer. 5 The main drawback to OT is the labor entailed. Recipients must be exactly synchronized and musthave their preovulatory follicle successfully aspi-rated (or be early estrus and be hor-monally treated); 7,8the donor mare must be monitored for follicle activity and have her follicle successfully aspirated, the recipient must be insem-inated (thus good-quality semen is required), andthen the surgery must be performed and the recipi-ent cared for afterward. When OT is used clinicallywith old, sub-fertile donor mares, the foaling rate isonly approximately 25% per oocyte transferred 5,9,10 therefore 75% of the time this labor will not result ina foal. However, it is a viable method for producingfoals from mares that cannot produce foals via nat-ural conception or ET. Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (Cloning) Cloning is an effective method to produce a young,fertile lly with the genetics of the original donor.This lly can then be bred throughout its life\u2014including via assisted reproductive technologies\u2014toproduce foals carrying the original donor mare'sgenetics. Cloning typically involves transfer of the donor mares' genome (via the nucleus of one of her somaticcells) into a host oocyte obtained from another mare.Host oocytes are typically obtained from ovaries re-covered from an abattoir. The mitochondria of theresulting foal will be that of the host oocyte, not ofthe original donor mare. It is unknown whetherthis has any effect on the cloned offspring but theclient must be informed of this, and educated tounderstand what it means. If this is important toyour client, this can be avoided by performing nu-clear transfer on oocytes recovered from mares thatare maternally related to the donor. 11 Cloned foals and their progeny are not able to be registered with many breed registries. If registra-tion is important to your client, then they shouldcheck with their breed registry to determine theregulations regarding clones. Cloning is many times more expensive than is one cycle of ICSI or OT; however, once the cloned lly isproduced, the expense of achieving foals from her isthat of standard reproductive procedures. Thus,over the cloned lly's life span, her ability to produce 156 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MAREnumerous foals, especially using techniques such asET, will lead to a cost per foal that is much less thanif multiple ICSI or OT cycles are performed on theoriginal sub-fertile donor mare. There is only one commercial company in the United States that clones horses. bThere are two commercial companies in Argentina that clone horses. Thus, for practitioners with patients inother countries, it is necessary to send cells interna-tionally to produce a cloned foal. This will requiretesting and quarantine of the donor animal beforethe tissue sample is obtained, but such testing isnecessary only once for obtaining the tissue sample.It is advisable to plan the cell preservation in ad-vance, arranging all import requirements and pa-perwork before the tissue is obtained. Althoughtissue culture may be conducted locally and the fro-zen cultured cells shipped to the cloning laboratory,some laboratories have found variable results withthese cells and prefer to have the tissue sampleshipped directly. Factors Regarding the Choice of Assisted Reproductive Technologies for a Given Sub-Fertile Mare OocytesIf the mare's subfertility is oocyte related, i.e., sheproduces no oocytes or produces only nonviableoocytes (e.g., due to extreme age, exposure to toxins,disease, or removal of the ovaries), neither ICSI norOT will be useful, and cloning should be considered.GeneticsIf the mare's oocyte-related subfertility is genetic,such as a mutation a chromosomal abnormality,cloning is possible but the chromosomal abnormalitywill also be present in the cloned lly, thus obtainingoffspring from this genetic line through the clonedlly will still not be possible. Technical proceduresfor correcting mutations in a specic cell line by gene\"editing\" are currently under development and arepromising, but are not yet ready for clinical use.Once this becomes feasible, in theory the mutationcould be corrected in cells in culture, and those cellsused for cloning, producing a cloned lly with thegenetics of the donor mare but without themutation.AgeInterestingly, mare age itself does not seem to be amajor factor in the success of ICSI or OT. This isnotable in light of the pioneering paper in OT, inwhich oocytes from old mares (/H11022 20 y) had a signif- icantly lower pregnancy rate after OT than didoocytes from young mares. 3However, that study was performed with research animals and the young mares were 6-10 years of age. In clinical practice,in which essentially all mares entering the OT pro-gram are greater than 17 years of age, no signicanteffect of donor age has been found in OT. 5,9Our data with ICSI also suggests no signicant effect ofdonor age on the oocyte recovery rate, maturation rate, or rate of blastocyst development after ICSIuntil mares are at least 24 years old; however, thenumber of follicles declines signicantly with age,thus fewer oocytes are recovered, reducing the ef-ciency per aspiration performed. 12 If mares are so old that they bring up only one or two follicles per cycle, and/or only cycle a few timesper year, assigning the mare to recovery of theoocyte from the dominant stimulated follicle shouldbe considered for two reasons: 1) the recovery rateis higher, and 2) the quality of the oocyte should behigher. However, it is possible that aged mares donot have the appropriate hormonal environment toraise preovulatory follicles up with maximal oocyteviability, and thus that recovering immatureoocytes, even if only one or two per cycle, mightprovide better-quality oocytes. The solution hereremains to be determined. Idiopathic Infertility In some mares, idiopathic infertility seems to be oocyte-related, as numerous attempts to producefoals from these mares' ICSI or recurring hemorrhagic anovulatory fol- licles are good candidates for TVA of immature fol-licles, as recovering immature oocytes and maturingthem in vitro avoids the problems associated withpreovulatory follicle development in these mares.Recovery of multiple immature oocytes from thesemares leads to selection of ICSI as the method ofchoice for their fertilization. Chronic Uterine Infection If the mare has a chronic uterine infection, she is a poor candidate for TVA. This is because the vaginawill be contaminated with the causal organism, andduring TVA a needle is passed through the vaginalwall into the peritoneum and ovary, thus riskinginduction of peritonitis or ovarian infection frommicroorganisms carried in with the needle. In suchmares, we recommend trying to clear the infectionbefore TVA is performed. Given that the mare willnot be inseminated again, this is sometimes possi-ble; extreme methods such as cervical wedge resec-tion or chemical curettage are applicable asthe mare will not need to carry an embryo again.Clearing of the infection should be monitored by lackof fluid in the uterus on transrectal ultrasound ex-amination and lack of a vulvar discharge, and im-mediately before performing the TVA, checking forlack of exudate in the vagina on speculum examina-tion. Clearing of the infection should not be moni-tored by taking a uterine swab, as performing anytranscervical manipulation, including the swab pro-cedure, may reintroduce organisms into an ex-tremely susceptible uterus 13and cause the infection to recur. AAEP /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 157HOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MAREIf the uterine infection cannot be cleared, it may be possible to perform TVA on the mare successfullyif she is managed appropriately with systemic anti-biotics, without increased incidence of negative ad-verse effects. Alternatively, TVA can be avoidedand the mare assigned to aspiration of the dominantstimulated follicle via flank aspiration. Unfortu-nately, as noted above, aspiration of the dominantstimulated follicle greatly reduces the efciency ofICSI per cycle, given that the oocyte is recoveredonly 80% of the time, and if recovery is successful,only one oocyte is available for ICSI. 3. Results ICSI If ICSI is conducted using TVA of all immaturefollicles and in vitro maturation of the recoveredoocytes, reported blastocyst production is approxi-mately 50-100% per aspiration. 12,14,15What we nd in our program is that many mares yield no blastocysts after an aspiration, and others can yieldseveral blastocysts. This may be related to individ-ual differences in mare oocyte quality, or possibly tosome effect (currently unstudied) of the stage ofcycle on oocyte developmental competence. The effect of the cause of subfertility on results after ICSI is unclear. Colleoni et al 14found no dif - ference in blastocyst development between eightmares presented for ICSI with reproductive disor-ders and 22 mares that were reproductively sound.We do not receive a reproductive history from manymares that present for TVA at Texas A&M, nor fromthe mares from which we receive shipped oocytes.If we separate the mares by the stallions used\u2014whether the stallion is available for breeding onlyvia ICSI, due to limited stores of frozen semen\u2014wemight suppose that the mares going to ICSI-onlystallions would tend to be more reproductively nor-mal than would mares having ICSI performed to astallion available for standard breeding techniques.In our data, there is a slight difference in blastocystrates per injected oocyte between these two stalliontypes (25 vs 21%, respectively, n /H11005574 and 399, respectively). The pregnancy rate after transfer of ICSI blasto- cysts may be good (82% for fresh embryos, 1269% for frozen embryos16) but embryo loss can be high (e.g., 20-30% of established pregnancies12). Foals produced from ICSI embryos seem to be completely normal, although to the best of ourknowledge no systematic studies on this have beenconducted. Oocyte Transfer Reports on clinical use of OT for management ofsub-fertile mares have found a 19-29% ongoing preg- nancy or foaling per (in vivo-matured) oocyte trans-ferred. 5,9,10Again, initial pregnancy rate may be higher, but 21-30% of the pregnancies are lost.5,9,10 Foals produced from OT seem to be normal.Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (Cloning) Commercial companies do not release their data; thus it is unclear what proportion of attempts atnuclear transfer at these facilities produce live foals.In our research program at Texas A&M, we haveproduced live foals from each of the nine horses wehave attempted to clone; thus, it is possible for thisto be an effective technique. Foals produced by nuclear transfer can have health problems at birth. In a retrospective studyof foals produced by nuclear transfer at Texas A&M,we found that 50% of cloned foals produced werecompletely normal, and 50% had some problem atbirth, most commonly maladjustment, enlarged um-bilicus, and contracture of the front limbs. Two of14 foals died within 7 days of birth; in the remainderany problems present resolved with treatment. 17 Although to the best of my knowledge there are no reports on fertility of cloned horses, the cloned lliesproduced in our laboratory have had normal fertil-ity, with owners reporting numerous foals producedfrom each by ET. 4. Discussion Equine practitioners who were in practice beforethese assisted reproductive procedures were avail-able understand the amazing relief of being able tooffer clients methods to obtain foals from valuablemares whose uterus, oviducts, or even ovaries arenonfunctional. More extensive availability of ICSIwill allow practitioners across the globe access tothis effective technique. I remain surprised at howfew practitioners have used OT, an effective methodthat can be conducted in-house in a practice with astanding surgery facility, with minimal additionalequipment required. Having worked with ET, OT,ICSI, and cloning, when registration is not an issueI believe that cloning should be considered by moreclients. Once the cloned lly is produced, the head-ache and expense of conducting repeated assistedreproductive techniques\u2014often with negative andfrustrating results\u2014is over.

Introduction Sub-fertile mares endocrinological chal-lenges both in their potential pathology and variableresponses to endocrine therapy. Despite this,achieving a live foal from a sub-fertile mare fre-quently depends on the veterinarian's application ofappropriate endocrine therapy. 2. Follicular Growth Stimulation Hormonal stimulation to manage the transition pe-riod in normal mares is well reviewed 1and includes the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, gonado-tropins, ovulation-induction agents, progestogens,and dopamine antagonists (Table 1). Sub-fertilemares can include mares that seem to persist inanestrus or transition well beyond other mares inthe same environment. The reasons for this arepoorly understood and likely due to multiple causes.Many of the same treatments used for expeditingthe transitional period are used in mares with fol-licular activity during the breeding season to sched-ule or induce ovulation. There is intriguing potential in the use of recom- binant equine gonadotropins. Recombinant gonad-otropins do not require obtaining equine pituitariesand avoid the concern about contamination withother hormones or infectious agents. Potential ap-plications for sub-fertile mares include superovula- tion to increase the of or \"targets\" of follicular activity in thedeeply anestrus mare. 2 3. Ovulation Induction Reliable induction of ovulation is a valuable tool to aid in optimizing the breeding of sub-fertile mares.Two more commonly used products are human cho-rionic gonadotropin a(hCG) and deslorelin acetateb (DA). The efcacy of (1.8 mg, IM) was com-pared with hCG (2500 IU, IV). There was no dif-ference in the percentage of mares that ovulatedwithin 48 hours after DA compared with hCG.There was a signicant increase in the percentage ofmares that ovulated within 24 hours after adminis-tration of hCG compared with DA, although it wasconsidered the dominant follicle in both groups mayhave been influenced by endogenous luteinizing hor-mone promoting early ovulation. A signicant dif-ference in follicle size was noted between groups,with the DA group having a follicle size of 39.9 /H110064.5 mm, and the hCG group having a follicle size of41.3/H110064.3 mm. However, the average intervals to ovulation were 41.4 /H110069.4 hours for DA and 160 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MARE NOTES44.4/H1100616.5 hours for hCG, due to a number of mares in both groups having prolonged intervals to ovula-tion and nonovulation in the hCG group. 3The variation in response to hCG administration overtime to individual mares has been theorized to bethe result of anti-hCG antibody induction; however,one study determined that there was no correlationbetween either the hCG-invoked immune response,or the ovulation time and pregnancy rate. 4Fur- thermore, cross-reactivity studies showed no signif-icant equine-luteinizing hormone (eLH) orequine chorionic Ovulatory agents may improve reproductive ef- ciency beyond ovulation timing. Ko \u00a8hne et al4re- ported that progesterone concentrations 5-15 daysafter ovulation were higher in mares whose ovula-tions were induced with hCG (n /H1100514) compared with mares whose ovulations were not induced (n /H11005 28). 5Nagao et al5evaluated the use of deslorelin to reliably induce double ovulation to optimize embryo production.6After luteolysis 8 days post ovulation, mares were monitored until two follicles (20-25 mmin diameter) were detected. At this time, 100 /H9262g DA was administered every 12 hours. Ovulationwas induced with 2500 IU hCG. The number ofdays until ovulation was 3.5 days in the deslorelin-treated group and 6.7 days in the control (saline-treated) group. The interval to ovulation wasshorter in DA-treated hCG-induced mares (35 /H11006 6.1 h) compared with saline-treated mares (42 /H11006 5.1 h). The average number of ovulations per es-trous cycle and the number of recovered embryos perestrous cycle was greater in the deslorelin-treatedgroup. There was no difference in the number ofembryos recovered per ovulation. 6 4. Mating-Induced Endometritis Sub-fertile mares frequently suffer from delayeduterine clearance after breeding. Oxytocin is one ofthe most commonly used ecbolics to aid in post-breeding uterine clearance. Administration of 10IU oxytocin IV induced a similar number of uterinecontractions in normal mares compared with mares with delayed uterine clearance. The duration ofuterine contractions was approximately 24 min-utes. 7Dose of oxytocin has an effect on contractil - ity, whereby higher doses lead to segmentalcontractility that may impede peristaltic clearance,whereas lower doses promote evacuation by coordi-nated peristalsis. 8,9Carbetocin is a long-acting oxytocin analog not available in the United States. Its efcacy has been studied in an ex vivo myome-trial tissue model, revealing a half-life of 17 minutescompared with the oxytocin half-life of 6.8 min-utes. 10Ecbolic effects can also be achieved by the use of cloprostenol; however, this has been shown to deleteriously affect progesterone production fromthe developing corpus luteum. 11,12 Glucocorticoids have been used to Compounds investigatedinclude prednisolone acetate and dexametha-sone. 13,14In a fertility trial evaluating the use of 0.1 mg/kg prednisolone acetate, none of fteen mares achieved pregnancy without prednisolonetreatment whereas 64.5% achieved pregnancy withprednisolone treatment. 13Dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg IV) administered once at the time of breeding was evaluated for efcacy in reducing breeding in-duced inflammation and increasing pregnancy ratesin susceptible mares. Pregnancy rates were signif-icantly improved in mares with at least three riskfactors (abnormal reproductive history, positive en-dometrial culture, at least 2 cm endometrial fluidprior to perineal conformationor unrepaired cer-vix, greater than 1.5 cm post-breeding fluid, post-breeding fluid persisting beyond 36 h, andabnormalities of the reproductive tract). 14A dose of 0.1 mg/kg IV dexamethasone with intrauterine infusion of 105colony forming units (CFU) of E. coli was used to assess changes in pro- and anti-inflam- matory cytokine expression. Treatment with dexa-methasone at the time of breeding caused asignicant effect on endometrial expression of cyto-kines and serum amyloid A (SAA) in susceptibleTable 1.

Metabolic Syndrome Insulin resistance can be associated with equinemetabolic syndrome and pituitary pars intermediadysfunction (PPID). Metabolic additionally regional adiposityand a pro-inflammatory state. In humans, insulinplays a major role in regulation of ovarian steroido-genesis, follicular development, and granulosa cellproliferation. 16Research in other species suggests that maternal insulin resistance contributes to oxi- dative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction inoocytes. 17The intrafollicular environment and oocyte quality are also altered in mares with meta- bolic syndrome.18,19Pregnant mares in the nal third of gestation demonstrated lower insulin sensi- tivity, lower basal glucose clearance rate, and alower acute insulin response to glucose comparedwith nonpregnant mares. Pregnant mares con-suming a high starch feed had greater glycemic andinsulinemic responses to feed than nonpregnantmares or pregnant mares consuming a diet high infat and ber. Monitoring the dietary energy con-tent of feed may be of increased importance in preg-nant mares. 20Evidence in other species also suggests that maternal obesity increases the risk of obesity and insulin resistance in offspring.21 Endocrine therapy for management of endocrine disease is complicated by the challenges of accuratediagnosis. Although not directly endocrine ther-apy, dietary modication and exercise are integralcomponents of management. mended for by mouth). Cyproheptadine (0.25 mg/kg, ev-ery 12 h, by mouth) may also be used typically toaugment pergolide in horses with more advancedPPID. As a prolactin antagonist, the use of per-golide during late gestation may affect initiation oflactation. In addition to diet and weight management, levo- thyroxine sodium and metformin hydrochloride canbe used to manage dysregulation. Levothy-roxine sodium (0.1-0.15 mg/kg, every 24 h, bymouth) lowers body weight and improves insulinsensitivity in horses. Metformin hydrochloride (30mg/kg every 8-12 h, by mouth) 1 hour before feedingor turnout may improve resting insulin concentra-tions and insulin sensitivity, and decrease blood glu-cose and insulin concentrations after feeding. 22,236. Pregnancy Maintenance The chance of pregnancy loss is always of great concern in sub-fertile mares. Progesterone and/orprogestogen supplementation is commonly imple-mented to \"prevent\" abortion or at least to be seen tobe making every attempt to prevent abortion. In ademonstration of their efcacy, progesterone and/oraltrenogest maintained early pregnancy in ovariec-tomized recipient mares when mares were adminis-tered 300 mg progesterone daily or 0.044 mg/kgaltrenogest daily. 24A of estradiol benzoate and a long-acting progesterone prepara- tion was able to maintain pregnancy in anovulatory,transitional recipient mares. 25Protocols differ from that used to manage cyclicity in the mare in the time leading up to breeding. The widespread administration of altrenogest to prevent pregnancy failure is not evidence based;however, positive effects on live-foal rates are possi-bly indicated in selected conditions including twin reduction, be elevated in compromised preg- nancies, and there is some uncertainty as to thevalue of exogenous progestogen administration ifplasma progestogens are already elevated. 27 Estrogen therapy for pregnancy maintenance is considered controversial and is not widely discussedin the literature. Estrogens decrease signicantlyin mares with experimentally induced ascendingplacentitis. 28One report describes a higher live- foal rate in mares assumed to be affected by placen- titis supplemented with estrogens versus mares notsupplemented with estrogens. 29However, in a study evaluating the last trimester of gestation with administration of letrozole, a potent aromatase in-hibitor preventing the conversion of androgens toestrogens in the placenta, no changes were observedin the length of gestation, uterine artery hemody-namics, or neonatal viability. Foals from treatedmares were signicantly smaller than those of con-trol mares at birth. 30 Endocrine therapy is essential for managing sub- fertile mares. Appropriate therapy is guided byclinical observations; diagnostics, which are re-viewed in another paper in this session; and re-sponse to treatment.

Introduction An economically successful brood mare needs toproduce a viable foal annually. For this to occur,she needs to be in good physical condition, haveregular estrous cycles, mate, conceive, maintainpregnancy, give birth, and raise a foal. If there isa breakdown in any of these areas she will becomeconsidered a \"problem\" mare. Consideration ofbreeding practices and fertility of the stallion isimportant before all the blame of subfertility isplaced on the mare. Therefore, to manage themare appropriately a complete reproductive exam-ination is imperative to identify the potentialcause of the mare's subfertility. A complete re-production evaluation can include the following:a complete history of the mare's past well as culture, cytology, and biopsy of theendometrium. Additional procedures that maybe used to identify the cause of subfertility arehysteroscopic examination, endocrine assays, cy-togenetic testing, and activation of zooepidemicus . Once an etiology has been de- termined, treatment and management can beorchestrated.This paper will focus on uterine culture and cytol- ogy as a useful tool in the diagnosis of endometrialinflammation and an indicator of bacterial endome-tritis. 1-3Endometrial cytology has been described and related to bacteriological ndings by severalauthors. 4-7Different methods to identify inflamma- tory cells (presence, type, and number), mucus, anddebris have been described in the literature to in-clude guarded swabs, cytology brushes, low volumelavage, and endometrial biopsy. 4,6,7The low- volume lavage technique has demonstrated as sensitive and cytological results obtained by endometrial bi-opsy are the most sensitive indicators bearing posi-tive predictive value compared with results obtainedby endometrial swab. 9Thus, bacteriological and the diagnosisof endometritis. 2,4 Endometrial biopsies can be indicated in barren mares, repeat breeders, early embryonic death orabortion, pyometra and mucometra, genital surgery,and fertility evaluation. 2,6Not only are they useful for culture and cytology as previously mentioned, 164 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MARE NOTESbut they provide an endometrial biopsy score, whichis an accepted marker of uterine health and pre-dicted fertility. 10More than one sample from dif - ferent areas of the uterus can be obtained to verifythe repeatability of degenerative changes. 11The endometrium is classied according to the presence of inflammation (type and severity), endometrialgland density, periglandular brosis number and severity of pathologies increase so does the category classication, whereas the potential ofcarrying a foal to term decreases. 13Category I has little or no pathologic changes with an 80-90% foaling rate. Category IIA has either slight-to-moderate diffuse supercial inflammatory changes, infrequent brotic changes involving individualglands (less than three layers of brosis), mild -brotic nesting, or lymphatic lacunae. Mares be expected a foal to term 50-80% of the time. CategoryIIB is any mare barren for 2 years or more, or withwidespread diffuse, moderately severe inflamma-tion, or more extensive brotic changes of individualglands with increased gland nesting. Thesechanges lead to a 10-50% expected term foalingrate. Category III has widespread, diffuse, severeinflammation with extensive brosis and nesting.Unfortunately, the Kenny-Doig classication systemdescribed may be present within theendometrium. 12-14 2. Materials and Methods Most subfertile mares have a pendulous uterus thatsits cranially and ventrally in the caudal abdomendue to stretching of the broad ligaments with in-creased age and parity, decreased uterine contrac-tility, and poor perineal conformation. 15These factors, combined with gravity, cause intraluminal fluid, inflammatory cells, bacteria, mucus, and de-bris to reside in the most dependent part of theuterus, usually the base of the uterine horns. Anendometrial sample obtained by a guarded swab orbrush would only reach an area of the uterine bodyjust cranial to the cervix due to the swab's length.Therefore, in the author's opinion, to obtain a rep-resentative sample of the uterine environment inthese problem mares, culture and cytology should beperformed with a low-volume lavage or endometrialbiopsy. Low-volume is described by LeBlanc by infusing theuterus with lactatedRinger's solution. 7The mare's perineal region is cleansed, especially between the vulvar lips. A sterile closed system is used with a catheter passedper vaginum into the uterus and up into a uterinehorn by an examiner whose arm is covered by asterile sleeve. Commercially obtained uterine la-vage tubes or medical grade silicone tubing can be used. 7Sterile saline is infused into the uterus by attaching either a 60-mL catheter-tip syringe con- taining 60 mL of saline or a 150-mL bag of sterilesaline to the end of the catheter. 7The uterus is massaged by transrectal palpation to distribute the fluid throughout the lumen, and subsequently, theeffluent is recovered back into the attached sterilebag. 7If the mare is in heat and the fluid is trapped in the edematous endometrial folds, the administra- tion of 10 IU stimulate uterinedrainage through myometrial contractions is recom-mended. 12However, when a small volume is placed into a pendulous large atonic uterus it can be very difcult to retrieve, especially if it has dissi-pated into the horns and extensive transrectal ma-nipulation can lead to contamination and increasedprocedure duration, which, in a eld situation maynot be optimal. The author therefore cathetersuch as bivona awith a Christmas tree, and an ex - tension set is connected to a sterile liter bottle offluids. The catheter system is primed with fluidand placed into the uterus shielding the tip of the flush catheter with a sterile gloved hand as it entersthe vagina, cervix, and uterus. The bottle ofwarmed fluids is inverted upside down and gravityallows influx into the uterus. The fluid dispersesthroughout the uterus by gravity rapidly. Removalof the fluid occurs with lowering of the bottle towardthe ground, thus minimizing contamination. Thesterile top is replaced and sealed with tape for de-livery to the laboratory. The recovered effluent isevaluated for cloudiness and the amount of mucus.When using the smaller volume (60-150 mL) toobtain the precipitate, the sample is allowed to set-tle for at least 30-60 minutes or centrifuged at400/H11003 gfor 10 minutes and all but 5 mL of the supernatant is discarded. The pellet is then sam-pled with a sterile cotton swab for culture and an-other for cytology. Whe n1Li s used, the laboratory at Hagyard Equine Medical Institute allows the bot-tle to sit for 1 hour. After the lavage effluent hassettled, a 10-mL pipet is inserted to the bottom ofbottle slowly and 10 mL of the sediment is drawn up.Five mL lavage sediment is placed in two 12 /H11003 75-mm test tubes. The tubes are centrifuged at400/H11003gfor 1 min. The supernatant is discarded, and the pellet is resuspended in the small amount offluid remaining in the bottom of the tube. Onesample is used for culture and the other for cytology.Two cytology samples are made by rolling the cellsonto a glass microscope slide. One is then Wrightstained and the other Gram stained. A swab of thecellular material from the other tube is streaked onblood and MacConkey agar aand incubated for 48 hours. Samples must be processed for culture within 8 hours because saline does not preservebacteria. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 165HOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MAREEndometrial biopsies can be performed when the mare is in estrus or diestrus. If the mare is indiestrus, the author prefers to perform the proce-dure 6 days post ovulation so that prostaglandin canbe administered to bring the mare back into estrusand open the cervix allowing any hemorrhage orcontamination that occurred during the process tobe evacuated. For the biopsy, the rectum is evacu-ated and the perineal area cleaned. The biopsyinstrument bis hand guided through the vagina and cervix into the uterus. The instrument is then identied per rectum and advanced to allow sam-pling at the base of a horn. If pathology has beennoted on ultrasound, sampling of that area or hornon the ventral aspect of the uterus may be morerepresentative. The sample is then removed fromthe biopsy basket with a 25-gauge needle so as not todestroy the sample architecture, and the biopsy isplaced in 10% formalin or Bouin's solution for xa-tion. The sample is then sectioned for histopatho-logical examination. If the biopsy is to be used forculture and cytology then placing a sterile speculumin the vagina through which to pass the biopsy in-strument allows less contamination on insertion andremoval. 4The author has also placed a sterile sleeve over the biopsy instrument for passagethrough the vagina and into the cervix, at whichpoint the biopsy instrument is pushed through thenger of the sleeve and inserted into the uterus.There may be some contamination on removal of thebiopsy instrument; however, this has been found tobe minimal. The sample is then smeared on Mac-Conkey and blood agar for bacteriology and a slide isprepared for cytology. 3. Results Cytological evaluation of any uterine sample shouldnot only include the presence, type, and quantity ofinflammatory cells, but also identify endometrialcells, red blood cells, bacteria, amount of mucus,debris, fungal elements or yeast, and anything elsethat is seen that would provide pertinent informa-tion i.e., urine crystals, squamous epithelial cells,sperm, and powder crystals. 16The presence of en - dometrial cells suggests that the sample is represen-tative of the uterine environment, whereas thepresence of stratied squamous epithelial cells sug-gests vaginal contamination or possible pneumome-tra. Identication of the other parameters allowsthe clinician to devise an appropriate treatmentplan. Slides should be reviewed rst on 10 /H11003to scan for cellular material, then at 40/H11003 to quantitate cells, and oil immersion (100 /H11003) to quantitate and identify bacteria. 16Ten elds should be examined and the average of the ten elds used to determine quantity. At Hagyard Laboratory, the inflamma-tory cells and bacteria are quantitated eld 4/H11001, Gross: too numerous to count Culture results should contain the name of the organism, the growth quantity, and an antibioticsusceptibility report. It should also be noted onthe report if normal skin flora was present. AtHagyard Laboratory the growth is quantitated asfollows: Scant: 10 colonies or less Light: growth on primary streak only Moderate: growth on secondary streak Heavy: growth on last streak Endometrial biopsy provides histological identica- tion of are present(i.e., neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils), the se-verity, distribution (focal, diffuse) and endometrium in which they reside (i.e.,luminal epithelium, interstitium, perivascular,periglandular). There is a seasonal and a influence on the endometrium with obviousdifferences between anestrus, estrus, and diestrus.Glandular density, epithelial height, and mitotic ac-tivity should be recognized along with glandulardistension and nesting. The severity of brosisaround individual glands and around nesting shouldbe quantied. The quantity of blood vessels, andmore importantly, the amount of elastosis or degen-erative changes should be noted. To do this, a largeand deep enough piece of endometrium is necessaryto include the deeper vascular structures. Finally,the extent of lymphatic dilation or lacunae should beidentied and reported. A biopsy report from a pa-thologist will take into account the presence andseverity of the rst three factors identied above toprovide the Kenny-Doig grade, giving a predictivevalue or percentage for that mare to carry a foal toterm. In addition, a histopathological descriptionof other changes within the endometrium will beprovided, commenting on all the anatomy describedabove. Further examination of the biopsy slide by atheriogenologist can provide a clinical interpretationof the changes and conditions present, with subse-quent potential therapeutic recommendations. 4. Discussion By identifying the underlying pathologies within theuterus, specic management and treatment of theindividual sub-fertile mare is possible. On cytolog-ical examination, the inflammatory componentsmost commonly identied are white blood cells (neu-trophils). The presence of more than two whiteblood cells per high powered eld (HPF) suggeststhat there is an inflammatory response. 16Degen - erative versus nondegenerative neutrophils suggestchronic versus acute inflammation. Care must betaken in differentiating the dark staining nucleusnuclei of degenerative cells from yeast. 16Identi - cation of eosinophils is suggestive of pneumovagina/ /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MAREuterus and chronic inflammation or can besuggestive of fungal or yeast infection. 16The pres - ence of red blood cells can suggest hemorrhage ortrauma during sample collection. Red blood cellswill be accompanied by the occasional white bloodcell, without true inflammation being pres-ent. Identifying and quantifying the amount ofmucus present is important given that mucus secre-tion increases during experimental uterine inflam-mation and in mares with delayed uterineclearance. 17,18Uterine debris can suggest chronic inflammation with increased cellular breakdown, delayed uterine clearance in older mares, or poorcervical relaxation in young mares. If the uterusdoes not contract effectively or there is poor lym-phatic drainage, fluid and cellular debris (sloughedepithelial cells) are not extruded from the uterusand increased quantities are identied on cytology.The same occurs with the mare whose cervix doesnot relax, trapping fluid and cellular debris withinthe lumen. The presence of bacteria, specicallyintracellular bacteria, is highly suggestive of infec-tion, as is the presence of fungal elements or yeast.Identication of urine crystals (calcium carbonate orcalcium oxalate) suggests that the mare has vesico-vaginal reflux (pooling urine) in her uterus. Themost common pathogen isolated in these situationsisEnterococcus faecalis . 16Therefore, even if there is no observation of urine or urine crystals in the presence of Enterococcus faecalis , additional inves- tigation is necessary. The presence of squamousepithelial cells is not common; however, it can sig-nify that collection of the sample may have beendifcult and that growth of normal skin flora mayfollow. 16 Culture of the low volume lavage more readily identies the presence of Gram-negative bacteria ( E. coliorKlebsiella pneumoniae) , an advantage over other techniques,7therefore identifying mares that may not have cultured positive previously. Antibi- otic-sensitivity patterns further allow the appropri-ate antibiotic to be used in the treatment protocol. On receiving a biopsy report from a pathologist, a practitioner is quick to identify the Kenney-Doigclassication number assigned to the mare. Al-though this provides the client with a prognosis fortheir mare to carry to term, the veterinarian shouldidentify the pathological changes described in theevaluation. By understanding the ramications ofthese changes, therapeutic goals can be imple-mented. For example, the presence of acute orchronic inflammation necessitates further investiga-tion to identify the cause of the endometritis. Thismay require correction of perineal conformation orcervical defects or the identication of bacteriadeeper within the endometrium, or possibly a bio-lm. The presence of lymphatic lacunae impliesthe stagnation of lymph with decreased lymphaticdrainage suggesting that uterine clearance may bean issue. A recent study investigating the associa-tion of age and endometrial biopsy score with uter-ine fluid retention after insemination revealed increased age was associated with biopsy scores ofIIB and III and that these groups had an increasedincidence of fluid retention compared with I andIIA. 10This led to the conclusion that age was as - sociated with fluid retention and that classicationcriteria for susceptibility to persistent breeding in-duced endometritis is that the line between poten-tially resistant and susceptible mares can be drawnbetween biopsy scores IIA and IIB. 10Treatment using oxytocin and lavage may be benecial in those mares. Endometrosis or chronicdegenerative endometritis is progressive and irreversible and tends to worsen with age.11Degenerative changes may result from repeated inflammation from breeding and infec- tion.11The relationship of chronic degenerative endometrial disease with age and parity was inves- tigated and found that maiden mares of increasedage exhibited endometrial changes indicating thatage alone will be a causative factor in the develop-ment of endometrosis. 18These authors also sug - gested that mares with an increased number ofpregnancies had a higher incidence of poor endome-trial quality. 18 Uterine blood flow is a dynamic process influenced by hormones, the presence of semen and pregnan-cy. 19-21Increased age and parity has also been demonstrated to influence the severity of uterine blood flow changes. Older maiden mares had ahigher incidence of degenerative changes such asangiosclerosis or vascular elastosis than youngermares. 11Degeneration of the uterine vasculature seems to be strongly associated with increasing number of foals and is associated with decreaseduterine perfusion below physiological levels found innormal mares. 22-25The importance of adequate blood flow and drainage of the uterus has been fur- ther substantiated with the use of Doppler ultra-sonography, which has detected differences inuterine blood perfusion in mares with varying de-grees of endometrial degenerative changes. 21,25 Understanding and determining the underlyingpathology present on culture, cytology, or biopsyenables the practitioner to identify the potentialcause of subfertility in the mare. Using the ap-propriate treatments or pentoxifylline in mares with poor vas-cular perfusion and blocked lymphatics can aid inthe resolution of subfertility in the mare.

Introduction Endoscopy is the technique of using a rigid or flexi-ble endoscope to visualize internal organs and struc-tures. First described in the 1800s in humans, itsuse in veterinary medicine since the 1960s has en-hanced diagnostic and surgical capabilities acrossspecies and disciplines. In the mare, the rst report of endoscopy for reproductive purposes occurred in1969 as an enhanced method of uterine evaluationand biopsy. 1Two methods of endoscopy used in reproductive evaluation and treatment of the mare will be discussed: hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. The term hysteroscopy will be used to refer to passing the endoscope through the mare's cervix tovisualize as anadvanced means of evaluating uterine health (en-hanced visualization, targeted biopsy of tissue) andtreating lesion de-bridement, hydrotubation, or authors have published previous articles onthe use of hysteroscopy for reproductive tract eval-uation and treatment and may refer to the proce-dure as examination of the uterus through videoendoscopy and broscopy. 2-4In general, this pro - cedure is not commonly used as part of a routinebreeding soundness evaluation, given that most cervical exami-nation. Hysteroscopy is indicated in our practicewhen a known abnormality must be further charac-terized, when infertility has persisted (usuallythrough one breeding season) without an identiedcause despite aggressive management and normalndings on routine diagnostics, or when treatmentvia hysteroscopy is indicated. This article will fo-cus on hysteroscopy as a means for identifying ab-normalities and a more-detailed explanation of howto perform oviduct flushing or hydrotubation. La-ser removal of cysts and foreign body removal hasbeen previously described elsewhere and will onlybriefly be discussed. 5 Laparoscopy (passing a rigid endoscope through a flank incision to visualize the reproductive tract in the abdomen) is used even less frequently as amethod of reproductive tract evaluation and wasrst described in the mare in the 1970s as a methodto evaluate ovulation. 6,7Flank laparoscopy has been used to identify, biopsy, or characterize ab- normalities of the reproductive tract that liewithin the abdominal cavity (adhesions, hemato-mas, abscesses, and neoplasia), 169HOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE NOTESmalities in structures accessible by this method(ovarian neoplasia, oviductal prostaglandin E 2 (PGE2) application, adhesions). Laparoscopy is rarely indicated to identify and characterize lesions, given that most are identied by routine breedingsoundness examination procedures, but can help incases of remote adhesions, ovariectomy, and whenoviductal treatment (PGE 2application) is per - formed. Only the procedure of PGE2application will be described in detail here. 2. Materials Hysteroscopy A 1-m flexible videoendoscopea, 1-1.4-cm in diame - ter, with a biopsy channel for instrument introduc-tion is used most commonly and should allow accessto the tips of the uterine horns. The video-endo-scope should have a light source that illuminateswell for adequate visualization and also the abilityto insufflate the uterus. Prior to hysteroscopy, theendoscope and biopsy are disinfected with asterilizing agent, to the manufacturer'sinstructions, and then rinsed copiously with sterile,distilled water. Any instruments that will bepassed through the scope or into the uterine lumen(biopsy forceps, laser, guide wire, and tubing foroviduct catheterization) should be sterilized prior touse. The capability to record the procedure andstore images is ideal, as well as a monitor thatallows multiple people to view the real-time endos-copy to facilitate certain procedures. Cyst Removal Depending on the size of the cyst, either a biopsy toolor a laser (Nd:YAG or diode) can be passed throughthe channel of the scope for cyst removal. Diodelasers are used most commonly for Biopsy Alligator endoscopy biopsy forceps, (160-cm lengtha), are for sample collection when evaluating focallesions seen on hysteroscopy. Samples are placed in Bouin'sbor formalin beenused to debride endometrial plaques or lesions, andthe removed tissue can be submitted for culture andhistopathology. Foreign-Body Removal Rat-tooth endoscopy grasping forceps, /H11350160 cm lengtha, which can be passed through the biopsy channel of the endoscope, are ideal for grasping and removing small foreign bodies. Oviduct Hydrotubation Thirty minutes prior to the procedure, the mare isadministered ceftiofur crystalline free acid d(6.6 mg/kg IM) and flunixin megluminee(1.1 mg/kg; IV). The materials required for oviduct flushing include a gas-sterilized 200-cm polyethylene tubing (1.7-mmouter diameter) fwith a 22-gauge catheter tipgtted and glued inside the internal tubing and extending approximately 1 cm from the end of the tubing (Fig. 1).A guide wire (0.46 mm diameter, 220 cm long, hu-man angiocatheter guide wire h) is placed through the tubing with the rigid end extended through the catheter tip. Sterile lactated ringer's solution (20mL) in a 20-mL syringe with a 1.5-in nee-dle attached is used for flushing each oviduct via theintroduced catheter. 3. Methods Mare Preparation The mare is placed in stocks and the tail is wrapped and deflected to the side. The mare is sedated ap-proximately 5-10 minutes prior to the procedure.Dose of sedation is based on behavior of HCl k0.01-0.02 mg/kg and butorphanol or detomidineHCl (0.006-0.01 mg/kg) is administered again if seda-tion is not adequate or if procedure length dictates Fig. 1. Image of catheter tip, guide wire, and tubing used for oviduct flushing. 170 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 ultra-sonography is performed to determine whether themare's cervix is toned and appropriate for the proce-dure. Ideally, mares should be in mid-diestrus with aclosed cervix to allow adequate insufflation of theuterus. If the cervix is relaxed it can be very difcultto maintain insufflation, and may be impossible tovisualize the entire uterus or perform additional pro-cedures (cyst removal, oviduct flushing). As muchfecal material as possible is evacuated from the rec-tum, and the mare's perineum including the vulva,clitoral fossa, and vestibule are aseptically prepared. Personnel Depending on the procedure performed, it is ideal tohave three or four people present (not includingmare restraint) to facilitate instrument and samplehandling. One person (A) operates the endoscope(driver). One person (B) maintains position ofscope at the level of the cervix, advancing and redi-recting under the driver's (A's) guidance and pre-vents escape of air from the uterine lumen. And athird person (C) is available as needed for instru-ment placement through the portal and sample han-dling. For oviduct flushing it helps to have a fourthperson to expedite flushing, as described below. Hysteroscopy Procedure The operator (B) wearing a sterile sleeve and gloverst \"white balances\" the videoendoscopy for accu-rate visualization of tones and brightness. Sterilelubricant is applied to the back of the hand, and theendoscope is advanced into the vaginal vault. Thecervix and vagina are evaluated, and then the endo-scope is passed through the cervical canal. Oncethrough the cervix, the uterus is insufflated with airso that the uterine bifurcation can be visualized.Mean pressures of 18-30 mm Hg are enough tofacilitate visualization and pressures of 100 mm Hg,or overdistention should be avoided as mares be-come quite uncomfortable and damage to the uterusis possible. 8,9Sterile lactated ringer's solution or sterile 0.9% saline can be used to dilate the uterusfor evaluation in place of air and is often less irri-tating. It should be noted that aqueous solution foruterine distention makes visualization difcultwhen blood, mucus or exudate is present, and for-eign body removal is more difcult in some cases.If the cervix is dilated sufciently and insufflation isdifcult, the ngers or entire hand can be passedthrough the cervix and then positioned in the open-ing to stop the efflux of air or fluid. Orientation is achieved by allowing several drops of water to be expressed from the tip of the endo-scope; the direction the water falls identies theventral position, allowing determination of the leftand right horn. Once insufflation is achieved theendoscope is advanced into one of the uterine hornswith continuous air being infused as needed to suf-ciently dilate and visualize the entire endometriumof that horn. The lens at the tip of the endoscopemay need to be repositioned or rinsed so that the view is clear and passes through the center of theuterine horn until the end of the uterine horn andoviductal papilla are viewed. Slow removal from one uterine horn is performed making sure tovisualize 360\u00b0 of the endometrium of the uterinelumen until the tip of the endoscope is returned tothe bifurcation. The same procedure is repeatedfor the other uterine horn. The scope is thenretroflexed upon itself so that the cranial aspect ofthe cervix and caudal uterine body can be exam-ined. Following hysteroscopy, air is infused asthe endoscope is withdrawn from the cervix, dilat-ing the cervical lumen and allowing visualizationof some cervical defects (adhesions, sacculations,diverticulums). The effect endometrial cysts have on fertility is debated in the literature, but in some cases, basedon size and location, they are believed to be potentialdetriments to normal uterine function (impede em-bryo motility in early pregnancy, or impair uterineclearance). Intraluminal cysts are removed at thebase of the structure the cyst wall meets thenormal-appearing endometrium. Laser cyst re-moval/ablation has the advantage of reduced bleed-ing, although the smoke generated is irritating tothe endometrium and mares often require at leastone estrous cycle to recover from the procedure.Alternatively, when using laser cyst ablation, insuf-flation with sterile lactated ringers has been usedsuccessfully as well to minimize smoke irritation.If the cyst is pedunculated, biopsy forceps can beused to the base of stalk, and the cyst canbe removed entirely. Pedunculated cysts well withminimal bleeding. Intraluminal adhesions bebroken down with a laser or biopsy forceps depend-ing on the size and character of For-eign bodies identied during channel ofthe endoscope and removed with the endoscopethrough the cervix, or removed with uterine lavagefollowing hysteroscopy. Biopsy of areas of sus-pected pathology (plaques, mucoid debris) can beperformed and submitted for culture and histologicevaluation. Following hysteroscopy, the uterus is lavaged with sterile lactated ringer's solution (1-3 L) or untilthe is 10 IU of oxytocin lis adminis - tered IM to facilitate uterine clearance and allow theair to escape following insufflation. Transrectalpalpation and gentle manipulation of the uterus canaide in expressing the remaining air or fluid fromthe uterine lumen. A luteolytic agent (PGF 2/H9251or cloprostenol) should be administered at the end of the procedure and follow-up treatment dictated previously AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 171HOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MAREdescribed in detail by Inoue10using a hysteroscopic approach. hysteroscopic identication visual- ized hysteroscopically as described above. Once theendoscope is within several centimeters of the oviduc-tal papilla, the guide wire is advanced through thetubing approximately 0.5 cm and passed into the open-ing of the oviductal papilla by advancing the tubingand wire together (Figs. 2 and 3). Once the wire isrmly seated in the opening, the catheter tip attachedto the tubing is advanced over the wire and gentlepressure is applied to hold it in place as the wire isremoved rapidly. Once the wire is removed usingsterile gloves, the 20-mL syringe is attached by seating the needle into the end of the tubing and slowly butrmly flushing the entire volume of sterile fluidthrough the tubing. Ideally, no fluid is seen flowingfrom the oviductal papilla, although small amountsare considered acceptable, excessive backflow requiresrepeating catheterization. Often there is an initialresistance when flushing, which often gives way togentle pulsing pressure. If the pressure is too great,the fluid will flush out the oviductal opening, minimiz-ing the likelihood of oviduct rupture. Once the fluidis flushed, the catheter tip is removed and the endo-scope is repositioned in the opposite uterine horn torepeat the procedure on the contralateral side. Theguide wire is replaced into the tubing during endo-scope repositioning. Over insufflation of the uterusmakes positioning and catheterization difcult as theuterine horns often contort and the angle of the open-ing of the oviductal papilla can be oblique. Changingthe orientation of the oviductal papilla can be achievedby changing the position of the cervix (left, right, cra-nial, or caudal) while holding the endoscope in place.Following flushing of each oviduct, the uterus is la-vaged as described previously. Transrectal ultra-sound of the ovaries is performed, and air is oftenvisualized around the ovary and infundibulum andcan be useful to determine whether the flush waslikely successful. Laparoscopy Materials Routine preparation and instruments required for a flank incision is described elsewhere.11An 11-mm capabilities are used for this procedure. Oviduct PGE2Application One tube (2.5 mL) of PGE2(0.5 mg of dinoprostone,m) is divided as 0.25 mL volume per individual 0.5 mL sterilized embryo transfer straw with cotton plugs(two straws are used per oviduct). A sterilized em-bryo transfer Cassou gun with a stylet is used to dis-pense the gel. Procedure The mare is restrained in stocks and sedated. Po- tassium penicillin n(22 000 IU/kg) and gentamicin sulfateo(6.6 mg/kg) is administered IV 30 minutes prior to surgery. The flank region is clipped, asep- tically prepared, and draped. The laparoscopiccannula and obturator are introduced into the ab-dominal cavity thorought the flank. The cannula ispositioned midway from the ventral aspect of thetuber coxae and the last rib. The laparoscope isintroduced into the abdomen and the abdomen isinsufflated with CO 2to 18 mm Hg. The reproduc - tive tract within the abdominal cavity is evaluatedfor any abnormalities. Fig. 2.

The laparoscope and Cassou gun are removed andthe incision is closed in a routine fashion. The pro-cedure is repeated on the other side. Postoperativecare includes NSAID administration for 5 days withstall rest and small paddock turnout. The marecan be returned to routine management 7 days afterthe procedure and live cover is considered safewithin days following the procedure. 4. Discussion In our practice, the most common use of endoscopy isfor hysteroscopic evaluation of the uterus, lymphaticcyst ablation with laser and hydrotubation of theoviducts. Laparoscopy is used for advanced evalu-ation of the reproductive tract, ovariectomy, or PGE 2 application when hysteroscopic hydrotubation hasbeen unsuccessful. Hysteroscopic evaluation of the uterus is very useful in cases where the pathology cannot be identiedby traditional means. Candidates for hysteroscopyinclude mares with persistent infertility despite ag-gressive and appropriate management, persistent in-fectious endometritis, or abnormal fluid patterns inthe uterus or cervix on transrectal ultrasonography.Endoscopy in these cases has revealed intraluminaluterine adhesions (in one mare a complete horn hadbrosis extending across the entire opening of a uter-ine horn (Fig. 4), sacculations of the cervix or uterusthat can serve as a chronic nidus for infection, andforeign bodies that were missed on routine evalua-tions. Interestingly, in our practice approximately35% of mares that have hysteroscopy performed havean abnormality identied. of these pa-thologies has helped dene an appropriate treatmentand management plan, and often leads to an improve-ment in fertility in mares that an abnormality is iden-tied. In addition, nding no abnormality is helpfulin narrowing the differential list for causes of infertility. Cyst removal can often improve uterine clearance and in some mares seems to assist in future fertility.Most cysts do not interfere with embryo mobilityand hysteroscopy is helpful in identifying those cystswhich, due to their location and size may cause aproblem, and also facilitates their removal throughlaser ablation. Oviduct hydrotubation has been used in our prac- tice over the past 2 years with moderate success.From 2014-2015 breeding seasons, 64% of treatedmares (9 of 14) conceived in the same breeding sea-son following treatment after most mares had beenbred unsuccessfully three or more times prior totreatment. PGE 2application of the oviducts is still used in our practice but due to cost and limited availability of PGE2, hydrotubation has become the preferred method of oviduct treatment in the limited cases where this treatment is indicated.

Clinically, many of thesemares can be identied by the presence of two ormore centimeters of intrauterine fluid during es-trous or between 3 and 36 hours post-breeding. 1-3 Mares that suffer from PMIE have decreased preg-nancy rates and increased early embryonic lossrates. 4-6 A normal, transient inflammatory response occurs in all mares post-mating. In normal mares thisinflammation peaks at approximately 6-12 hoursand resolves by approximately 48 hours post-breed-ing. 7This inflammatory response is characterized by the influx of neutrophils and cytokines into theuterine lumen to aid in the phagocytosis of nonvia-ble spermatozoa and bacteria combined with uterinecontractions to expel fluid and debris from theuterus. Normal mares are also often referred to asresistant mares. In approximately 15% of maresthe after peaking ( /H110228h ) 8In addition, some mares suffer from delayed uterine clearance eitherdue to a larger, more pendulous uterus that hangs over the brim of the pelvis and/or poor myometrialcontractility resulting in the accumulation of fluidwithin the uterus. These mares, known as suscep-tible mares, often retain greater than 2 cm of fluidwithin the uterine lumen for 24 or more hours post-breeding and have decreased pregnancy rates. The uterine environment is very dynamic and must transition from an open system that is hospi-table to semen and able to mount an acute inflam-matory response to spermatozoa to rid the uterineenvironment of all foreign debris to becoming aclosed quiescent organ that is ready to accept anembryo within 5-6 days. Post-breeding inflamma-tion must be resolved by 96 hours post ovulation tomaximize embryo survival. 9 The introduction of spermatozoa, seminal plasma, extender, and bacteria at the time of breeding in-cites a cascade of inflammatory events. The re- moval of a large portion of the debris is viamechanical clearance; however, the innate immunesystem also plays a very important role in eliminat-ing any foreign material from the uterus. Sperma-tozoa activate complement present within theuterine secretions. The cleavage of signal polymorphonu-clear (PMNs), the influx of AAEP PROCEEDINGS 62 /H114082016 175HOW TO TREAT THE the acti - vated PMNs bind to and phagocytose spermatozoa.Secondly, the activation of the PMNs results in re-lease of prostaglandin from the cell membrane,which causes contractions of the smooth muscle ofthe myometrium. Removal of all debris from theuterus results in a decrease in the inflammation andreturn of the endometrium to its normal state. 10 In a normal uterus, the mucocilliary apparatus andendometrial folds play an important role in the re-moval of debris from the uterus. It has been dem-onstrated that this normal architecture and abilityto remove fluid and debris from the uterus is com-promised in the susceptible mare. In a study per-formed by LeBlanc et al 11, methylene blue dye was infused into the uteri of both susceptible and resis- tant mares. Upon examination of the uteri at nec-ropsy dye was found within the channels created bythe endometrial folds in resistant mares. In thesusceptible mares the dye remained pooled withinthe uterine body and there was loss of the distinctchannels seen in the resistant mares. In susceptible mares, also referred to as delayed uterine clearance mares, some failure in this normalinflammatory process occurs. One of a number ofdifferent scenarios possibly transpires in thesemares. These scenarios include but are not limitedto: The inability to modulate or turn off the inflam- matory response once it is triggered, resulting ina persistent inflammation. Fumuso et al 12 showed that after articial insemination (AI)with dead sperm the post-breeding inflamma-tory condition persisted in susceptible mares un-til seven days post ovulation. In normal mares,this response is modulated within 8-12 hoursand resolved by 36-48 hours. Poor mechanical secondary to de- creased myometrial activity, disruption vascular elastosis orlymphangectasia. Poor cervical dilation as seen in aged maiden mares or donor mares subjected to repeatedembryo flushes over several years, or second-ary to cervical trauma and brosis. A combination of poor uterine contractility re- sulting in the inability to clear debris from theuterus thereby continual stimulation of the in-flammatory pathway leading to the accumula-tion of more fluid. Mares that will develop prolonged post-mating en- dometritis may be difcult to identify prior to theirrst breeding. If the mare suffers from the inabil-ity to mechanically clear fluid from the uterus, thismay be evident prior to breeding and give an indi-cation to problems that may develop post-breeding.Oftentimes it is not evident that the mare is a sus-ceptible mare until she is examined 24 hours post-breeding. The hallmark sign of a susceptible mare is the presence of greater than 2 cm of intrauterinefluid at this time. The purpose of this paper is to describe the treat- ments for PMIE in mares where bacterial endome-tritis has been ruled out. 2. Treatment of Post-Breeding Endometritis It is important to realize that when PMIE is recog-nized after the mare has been bred the rst time, alltreatments are attempted to modulate an inflamma-tory response that has gone awry. Figurativelyspeaking, \"we are already behind the eight ball\" aswe attempted to modulate an inflammatory re-sponse that should have started down-regulatingapproximately 16 hours earlier. At this point, allattempts at treatment are to quiet down the im-mune system, help remove all of the inflammatorydebris from the uterus, and aid in stimulating uter-ine contractions to prevent further accumulation offluid within the uterus. There are four main com-ponents to treatment: modulation of the inflamma-tion with steroids or other immunomodulators,uterine lavage to remove debris, ecbolics to aid inuterine contractility, and antibiotics if needed toprevent the development of a bacterial component inthe compromised environment (Table 1). 3. Management of the Susceptible Mare to Prevent the Development of PMIE Once a mare is identied as or suspected to be a susceptible mare, management is focused on pre-venting the development of PMIE. Studies haveshown that treatment prior to breeding with corti-costeroids in mares considered high risk is muchmore advantageous than waiting to treat 24 hourspost-breeding. Mares treated prior to breeding hadincreased pregnancy rates compared with marestreated post-breeding. 3Secondly, given that the normal inflammatory response that occurs in mares starts to dissipate approximately 8 hours post-breeding, the implementation of a post-breeding la-vage and ecbolics treatment 6-8 hours afterbreeding aids in clearing the fluid and inflammatorydebris thus reducing the risk for furtherinflammation. 4. Corticosteroids (Dexamethasone, Prednisolone) Administration of systemic steroids prior to breed-ing has been shown to aid in the modulation ofpost-breeding endometritis and improve pregnancyrates in susceptible mares. Bucca et al 3demon - strated that the administration of 50 mg of dexam-ethasone aat the time of breeding in mares that exhibited four or more risk factors associated with PMIE resulted in improved pregnancy rates. How-ever, if the administration of the dexamethasonewas delayed until 24 hours post-breeding, no im-provement in pregnancy rates was observed. 2This study demonstrates the importance of modulating the inflammatory response initiated by breeding and 176 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MAREthe detrimental effects that it has when allowed tocontinue unchecked. A study by Papa et al 13also demonstrated an improvement in pregnancy rates of susceptible mares when prednisolonebwas administered around the time of breeding. Prednisolone, 0.1 mg/kg wasadministered orally every 12 hours for 48 hour priorto and post-breeding. Pregnancy rates signi-cantly increased in susceptible mares treated withprednisolone from 0.0-64.5%. 13 5. N-Acetylcysteine N-acetylcysteinechas both mucolytic and anti- inflammatory effects. It is impossible to separate the roles of these effects when administered. When ad-ministered intrauterine 24 hours prior to breeding to a group of mares that had not become pregnant aftertwo to ve cycles, LeBlanc 14achieved 85 percent preg - nancy rates post treatment. There are two protocolsfor the administration of acetylcysteine. For maresthat are known to be susceptible to developing PMIE itis recommended that 30 mL of acetylcysteine be di-luted in 150 mL of saline and infused into the uterus24 hours prior to breeding. Oxytocin (20 IU IV or IM)is administered 8 hours post infusion. If the mare isnot treated prior to breeding and it is noted that thepost-breed lavage is cloudy, infusion of 30 mL of ace-tylcysteine at the end of the lavage is benecial.A uterine lavage is then performed 24 hours later andthe nature of the efflux is evaluated.Frequently Used Medication for the Treatment of Persistent Post-Mating Induced EndometritisMedication Dose RouteFrequency of Administration Indications for Use Cloprostenol 125-250 mcg IM luteolysis to facilitate return to estrus; alsoeffective ecbolic Dexamethasone 50 mg IM Administer LRS only Misoprostol (PGE 1) Massage small hbefore manipulationor intromission Oral Every 12 h Modulation of post-breeding endometritis Starting 48 h prior to breeding to 48 h post-breeding N-acetylcysteine (20% solution)30 mL of a 20% solution diluted mL ofnormal salineIntrauterine 1-2 d before antibiotic infusionMucolytic Lavage uterus with saline 24 h after infusion 30 mL of a 20% solution diluted in 150 mL ofnormal salineIntrauterine Infuse 24 h prior to breeding followed byoxytocin injection (10-20 IU, IV or IM) 8-12 hafter infusionAnti-inflammatory 30 mL of a 20% solution diluted in 150 mL ofnormal salineIntrauterine Infuse into uterus after post-breeding lavage iflavage fluids are cloudyor if there was free-intra-uterine fluid afterbreedingPost-breeding therapy Infuse 30 mL directly into followup oxytocininjection TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MARE6. Immunomodulators Several studies have demonstrated that the admin-istration of Mycobacterium cell wall extract dprior to breeding resulted in improved pregnancy rates insusceptible mares. Fumuso et al 12showed that ad - ministation to susceptible mares at the time ofarticial insemination resulted in uterine immuno-logical changes similar to that found in resistantmares. Without a separate study, Rohr - bach et al15showed that mares diagnosed with per - sistent endometritis were more likely to becomepregnant when treated with P. acnes ecompared with untreated mares, which were treated intrave- nously with P. acnes on days 0, 2, and 6. Treatment with P. acnes was most effective in mares bred be- tween 2 days before to 8 days after the rst treat-ment. 15It should be noted that there have been anecdotal reports of mares developing high fevers after being treated systemically with mycobacte-rium cell wall extract. dTypically these fevers re - solve in several days with medical treatment. 7. Autologous Conditioned Serum/Platelet-Rich Plasma/Mesenchymal Stem Cells The ability of f, platelet-rich plasmag, or mysen stem cellshto modulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines and increase pregnancy rates of treated mares affords the veterinarian withyet another modality to treat PMIE. Reghini et al 16 showed that the intrauterine infusion of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into susceptible mares 4 hourspost-breeding reduced the post-breeding inflamma-tion when measured as the percent of neutrophils inuterine cytology, uterine fluid nitric oxide concentra-tion and uterine fluid accumulation. In anotherstudy by Metcalf, susceptible mares treated intra-uterine with PRP had a lower incidence of delayeduterine clearance and improved pregnancy ratesthan untreated mares (67 vs 19% in untreatedmares). 17Other biological agents that have been shown to be benecial in the modulation of inflam- mation include autologous andmesenchymal stem cells. 18When administered in - trauterine around the time of breeding in normalmares both autologous conditioned serum and mes-enchymal stem cells reduced the number of neutro-phils within the uterine lumen 6 hours post-breeding. These treatments may also prove to bebenecial in mares susceptible to PMIE. 18 8. Uterine Lavage Removal of dead sperm, bacteria, and inflammatorydebris from the intrauterine environment is crucialto modulation of the post-breeding inflammatory re-sponse. Lavage can be performed as early as 4hours post-breeding to aid it the treatment of PMIE.It is recommended that the uterus be lavaged re-peatedly with 1-3 liters of saline or lactated Ringer's solution until a clear effluent is obtained. 6,19-24 Uterine lavage may need to be performed for morethan 1 day and can be carried out to 3 days postovulation. 9. Ecbolics (Oxytocin, Cloprostenol) Due to delayed uterine clearance and the abnormalaccumulation of intra-uterine fluid in susceptiblemares, the use of ecbolics is paramount to treatmentof PMIE. The administration of oxytocin i(10-20 IU, IV or IM, every 4-12 h) or cloprostenolj(250 /H9262g IM once) has been shown to improve pregnancy rates when administered post-breeding.21,22Sev- eral studies have shown that administration of clo-prostenol after ovulation can have an effect oncorpus luteum (CL) function and fertility; therefore,its use should be limited to prior to ovulation. Ad-ministration of cloprostenol greater than 12 hoursafter ovulation has been associated with decreasedprogesterone levels and administration greater than2 days post ovulation has been associated with de-creased pregnancy rates. For these reasons admin-istration should be limited to estrus and no greaterthan 12 hours post ovulation. 25-27 In mares that suffer from poor uterine clearance due to poor cervical dilation the administration ofmisoprostol or N-butylscopolammonium kto the cer - vix may aid in softening and dilating the cervix.This product can be applied to the cervix 1-2 hoursprior to breeding or immediately following the post-breed lavage to aid in uterine clearance. Manualdilation of the cervix at the same time is also bene-cial. The utilization of these modalities to dilatethe cervix in conjunction with the administration ofecbolics may result in more effective clearance ofuterine fluid. Some mares that have developed a severely pen- dulous uterus may continue to be unable to clearuterine fluid even with uterine lavage and the ad-ministration of ecbolics. Uteropexy, a surgical pro-cedure in which the uterus is lifted and sutureddorsally to reposition it in a more normal horizontalposition, is benecial. 28 Although there are no scientic studies demon- strating the effectiveness of acupuncture on uterinefluid clearance, some practitioners believe it is ben-ecial in some susceptible mares. Acupuncture is atreatment modality that can be used to potentiallyaid in uterine fluid clearance. 10. Reducing or Limiting the Number of Covers or Inseminations Mares that are identied as susceptible to develop- ing PMIE should be managed so that breeding islimited to only once per cycle. Research has shownthat each subsequent breeding results in a morepronounced inflammatory response than the priorone, reinforcing the importance of minimizing thenumber of inflammatory insults the uterus suffers. 29 178 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MARE11. Role of Seminal Plasma in Modulating Inflammation Seminal plasma plays an important role in modu-lating the endometrial inflammatory response elic-ited by breeding. 30,31When semen is processed by centrifugation for cooled shipment or for cryopreser- vation, the percentage of seminal plasma in thebreeding dose is greatly reduced. Therefore, insome mares, the inflammatory response to the in-seminate that had some or all of the seminal plasmaremoved is much more pronounced. In most casesthere is no option to have seminal plasma added intothe dose of semen being used. However, it is im-portant to recognize the role seminal plasma playsin the development of PMIE, especially in the sus-ceptible mare. 12. Conclusion When managing a mare with a history of PMIE, it iscritical to treat the mare prior to breeding and in the6-8-hour post-breeding time period in an attempt tominimize and modulate the inflammatory responsebefore it becomes persistent. Numerous studieshave shown that treatments that prevent the devel-opment of PMIE are highly successful in improvingpregnancy rates in susceptible mares. Researchhas also demonstrated that if treatment is delayeduntil 24 hours post-breeding, no improvement inpregnancy rates is observed. The most difcultcases are mares that are being bred for the rst timeor their breeding history is unknown. If PMIE isnot identied until 24 hours post-breeding, treat-ments should be initiated at that time to remove thefluid from the uterus and modulate the inflamma-tory response. If the mare does not become preg-nant on that cycle then treatments to minimize andmodulate inflammation should be employed proac-tively on the subsequent cycle.

Introduction As equine veterinarians, we are all too familiar withuntimely patient death. Although we spend ourcareers attempting to avoid it, situations will arisethat are out of our hands and devastating for horseowners. Reasons for euthanasia of older horses(/H1135015 y) have been ranked in the United Kingdom as follows: lameness, colic, chronic illness, acute ill-ness, laminitis, fracture, and other. 1In a retro- spective study performed on a younger population ofathletic Swedish Warmbloods, causes of their deathor culling included (in order of prevalence): prob-lems with system, accidents,respiratory system disease, digestive system prob-lems, hoof, circulatory system, tumors, reproductive tract, urinary system, infectious diseases, miscella-neous, and unknown. 2As evident in these surveys, untimely death for a young or aged mare can happenbecause of various etiologies and occasionally beforethere is opportunity for her to reproduce. The eldof equine reproduction has advanced within the pastdecade allowing horse owners the opportunity forpropagating important genetics long after theirequine companion is no longer living. Obtaining successful pregnancies through oocyte harvest from mares that have died or been eutha-nized was rst reported through the use of oocytetransfer and later intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). 3,4Historically, traditional in-vitro fertiliza- tion techniques have been unsuccessful in the horse,thus driving the implementation of assisted fertil-ization through ICSI, which is now well establishedwithin the industry. In recent years advancementshave occurred to improve specic media and culturemethods for sperm-injected oocytes in vitro rate, allowed ICSI to gain particular popularity withhorse breeders. 5,6The use of sperm injection for oocytes collected from postmortem ovaries was rstpublished in 2012 with ICSI-produced blastocystsbeing transferred into recipient mares through atranscervical approach. 4This is now the technique most commonly used by laboratories offering thisprocedure to try and provide a successful pregnancyfrom a deceased mare. The purpose of this docu-ment is to describe the process of submitting post-mortem ovaries to make it as seamless as possiblefor referring veterinarians and horse owners inter-ested in this procedure. 2. Materials and Methods Cause of Death Time is of the utmost importance when a mare dies unexpectedly. Retrieving the ovaries from the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 181HOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MARE NOTESmare as soon as possible is recommended althoughdelays of up to 5 hours following death have beenreported with successful production of foals; how-ever, this particular mare was placed in a coolerimmediately following euthanasia. 7Obtaining the oocytes from the deteriorating environment of ex- cised ovaries should also be performed as soon aspossible. Research has suggested that oocyte har-vesting less than 6-8 hours after the mare's deathresults in the most favorable outcome for pregnan-cies carried to term. 8,9Occasionally a mare's eu - thanasia is planned, which allows the practitionerthe opportunity to coordinate her cycle to the best ofher ability. We generally recommend that a marebe in late diestrus or early estrus to maximize theamount of follicular activity available on her ova-ries, but the total number of oocytes collected isheavily dependent upon a variety of details. Ovary Removal and Packaging Although many pregnancies have been obtainedfrom ovaries collected from a mare humanely eutha-nized with a barbiturate overdose, the effects ofthese drugs upon the oocytes are still not fully un-derstood. In one retrospective study, foals were re-portedly produced from oocytes collected from mareseuthanized through means prior toeuthanasia. 4Oftentimes the particular situation will dictate the best method available for humane euthanasia. Removal of the ovaries is a fairly straightforward technique, which can easily be performed in a eldsetting in lateral recumbency. Both ovaries areusually obtainable from one side/incision negatingthe need to roll the horse over to the other side.At our facility, we perform this procedure wearingnonsterile palpation sleeves with an examinationglove on each hand. It is not necessary to maintainsurgical sterility, but asepsis is advised. Once inlateral positioning, make a 15-cm longitudinalskin incision along the flank halfway between thelast rib and the point of the hip (Fig. 1). Continuethis incision through both the external and internalabdominal oblique muscles. Once the incision isthrough the muscle layers, use a gloved hand tobluntly puncture through the peritoneum enteringinto the abdominal cavity, being careful to avoidpuncturing bowel and possibly contaminating theovarian surface. Ideally, locate the ovary con-tralateral to the incision rst by palpating over thedorsal surface of the uterine body and following theuterine horn. Oftentimes the location of this ovarydoes not allow for complete visualization and blinddissection with a pair of surgical scissors may benecessary. Once the contralateral ovary has beenremoved, the ipsilateral ovary should be located eas-ily and often can be completely seen through theincision (Fig. 2). Once removed, rinse both ovarieswith room temperature embryo flush solution, saline Fig. 2. The ipsilateral ovary can be visualized through the inci-sion and aseptically removed with surgical scissors. Fig. 1. A vertical incision should be made across the flank,halfway between the last rib and the point of the hip. 182 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO TREAT lactated Ringer's solution and placewithin a secure plastic bag with a small amount ofthe same fluid to keep the tissue moist duringtransport.LogisticsWhen a person uses the phrase, \"the devil is in thedetails,\" it does not begin to describe the process ofcoordinating logistics behind timely ovary transport,and it can often deter a practitioner from offeringthis service. There are several different optionsavailable, and having a plan in place prior to anemergency situation will ensure the smoothesttransport possible. Universities, large practices, orany private practitioner with known clientele inter-ested in this option should establish this plan ofaction in advance of actually implementing it. Prior to arranging shipments, the receiving facil- ity should be contacted and timing coordinated.The ovaries must arrive at a time when the receiv-ing facility can prepare a team to harvest the oocytesand perform ICSI at 24-30 hours later during thefollowing day. This timing might vary with facilityand time of year. If the laboratory offering postmortem ovary pro- cessing is within driving distance, that is often thebest option. Generally it is recommended to shipthese ovaries at body temperature ( /H1101137\u00b0C) but only if the transport time is within an hour. This can beachieved by using a thermoprotective container withwarmed bags o f 1 L saline surrounding and protect- ing the ovaries. If the mare has a chronic ailment whereupon hu- mane euthanasia can be coordinated, ovaries sentvia Fed-Ex or UPS next day delivery provide a reli-able method for reasonable shipping intervals andarrival times. Organizing the procedure towardthe end of the day but allowing time for removal andpackaging will allow for the shipment to be one ofthe last packages picked up for the day. By choos-ing next-day delivery with the option of rst in themorning drop-off service, the ovaries can be pro-cessed approximately 12-14 hours after the marehas been euthanized. More often than not, shipping ovaries via counter- to-counter method is the best available option for arapid transit time to their destination. A planeflight must be organized and direct flights are heav-ily recommended, given that ovaries are notoriousfor missing their connecting flight. In this post-9/11 era, shipping tissue specimens is not an easytask and long gone are the days of just pulling up toa commercial cargo ofce to quickly send specimens.If you are afliated with a group that commonlyships semen you are likely a \"known shipper\"through the Transportation Security Administra-tion and much of the legwork has already been per-formed. Typically, a receptionist or ofce manageralready savvy in organizing shipments will choosethe flight based on the airline you have an accountwith, ll out the air bill information, and arrange acourier to transport. If you belong to a practice that has not established this service yet but willroutinely use and are interested in it, be sure tobegin the steps of becoming a \"known shipper\" as farin advance as possible, given that it will take a fewmonths to establish an account with an airline.It is possible for a solo practitioner to ship ovaries ona \"one-up shipper\" emergency basis without previ-ous experience by personally escorting the containerto the cargo service of an airline once a flight ischosen. As the person responsible for the contentsof the shipment, you are required to present onegovernment-sanctioned form of identication or twoforms of other identication and ll out a dauntingamount of paperwork to vouch for the safety of yourshipment. This may take several hours of prepara-tion and will likely cause delay in a process that isextremely time dependent. To avoid many of these delays, various nationwide courier companies are available, maintain \"knownshipper\" accounts with many airlines, and will com- plete a large portion of the paperwork ahead of time.To identify a courier in a certain area, a simpleInternet search for the term \"courier\" servicing theairport closest to your location will often yield re-sults. Everything comes with a price though, andeach step along the route will cost an additionalamount when handled by a third party. It is im-portant to weigh all of the variables in these situa-tions to determine the best course of action forpotential success. Finally, if nances do not provide a signicant hurdle, several chartering companies offer emer-gency transport of items 24 hours a day, 7 days aweek. Air transportation services such as UPS Ex-press Critical or Sonic Delivery will provide expe-dited same-day delivery of items both for domesticand international locations. These services are fre-quently used by human hospitals for transport oforgans across the country and may provide a usefulservice for transporting ovaries from a very valuablemare. Packaging It is extremely important to avoid large temperature fluctuations during transportation, which places anemphasis on the importance of appropriate shippingcontainers. If possible, attempt to plan aheadwhile maintaining an awareness of the ambienttemperatures that change throughout the course oftravel. Extremely hot periods of the year can provecatastrophic if a container is required to wait on atarmac for a lengthy period of time. If transporttakes longer than a few hours, ship the ovaries atroom temperature ( /H1101122\u00b0C), although during partic- ularly hot months or extremely prolonged transport,shipping them slightly cooler may be benecial.It is not recommended to cool the ovaries below acool room temperature or placing them on ice, giventhat this could have an effect on pregnancy success. 7 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 183HOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MAREProviding a consistent environment can be achieved by using a shipping container intended forsemen. A passive cooling device a,bwith the coolant cans removed, a cooler insulated container, or a sim- ple Styrofoam box with added layers of insulationare viable options. A couple of 1-L bags of roomtemperature saline can be added to provide protec-tion and help to stabilize the ambient temperature.Ideally, a thermoregulating portable incubator c could be set to an ultra-precise temperature andmaintain a reliable environment for shipping post-mortem ovaries. Newer units of this incubator of-fer the convenience of setting the two separatechambers within the device at different tempera-tures. This device would be very useful in a prac-tice offering postmortem oocyte extraction oradditional assisted reproductive procedures. Stallion Choice Finally, a key step to consider from the very begin-ning of this process is stallion selection and semenshipment. Although equine oocytes have been suc-cessfully cryopreserved and foals been pro-duced, the efciency is not high. Therefore, werecommend fertilization of the collected oocytes byICSI, even if the embryos are to be cryopreserved.Consequently, a stallion or stallions must be se-lected for sperm injection. If the collected oocytessuccessfully mature, sperm will be needed for ICSIby approximately 24 hours after oocyte harvesting.If possible, frozen semen should be organized toarrive either with the ovaries or the following day.We often recommend two straws, to allow one for abackup, but this may need to be adjusted based onthe specic straws. Cooled/shipped semen may of-fer better results and can be collected the day ofovary arrival and shipped to arrive the next day,prior to the sperm injection procedure. A limitedamount of cooled semen is needed. One advantagefor ICSI is that a mare owner may choose more thanone stallion to inject individual oocytes; however, wegenerally do not recommend picking more than twostallions. Although the ICSI procedure uses mini-mal amounts of sperm, good-quality semen fromwhich to select sperm for oocyte injections is stillessential for optimal results. Available Facilities As of today, there are two main facilities within theUnited States and a facility in Europe with pub-lished results, offering commercial postmortemovary processing with an ICSI procedure. ColoradoState University 7and Texas A&M University4have had the longest running programs and have been paramount in conducting research that has led theway to successful pregnancies and foals born fromoocytes collected from postmortem ovaries, and asimilar program is available for the European com-munity d. More facilities are offering the oocyte harvesting aspect of excised postmortem ovaries and will subsequently ship the oocytes to a facility offer-ing ICSI services. Location within the country should dictate which facility is chosen, given thatthe race against time is a big factor toward success. 3. Results What to Expect Although beyond the scope of this article, below is a brief overview of the overall process as previouslydescribed. 3Upon arrival, the temperature is im - mediately checked within the fluid surrounding theovarian surface and recorded. The ovaries are thenrinsed with warmed saline or a complete embryoflush medium to gently remove potential organicdebris. The surface of the ovary is examined andloose parenchyma and remaining oviductal tissue isremoved to facilitate easier access to palpable folli-cles. Palpable follicles are incised with a scalpelblade and the follicular fluid collected within a petridish. The interior of each follicle is carefullyscraped with a bone curette of a size proportional tothe follicular dimensions (Fig. 3) to physically de-tach the cumulus oocyte complex, which has uniqueanatomical features and a tight attachment to thefollicular wall. 10After each visible follicle has been processed, the ovary is sliced into sections to expose any additional follicles for scraping. Although timeconsuming, this procedure has provided the bestmethod to collect complete cumulus oocyte com-plexes that result in competent oocytes for ICSI. 11 The most optimal scenario for success is when a practitioner is comfortable with the process of har-vesting oocytes from postmortem equine ovariesprior to shipping. Once obtained by the practitio-ner, immature oocytes can be placed within a suit-able holding medium. One such published mediumis me-dium), which can be maintained at room tempera- Fig. 3.

At the American Association of Equine PractitionersAnnual Conference in 2014, similar blastocyst rateswere obtained when the EH medium was replacedwith a commercial complete embryo holding solutionfor the purpose of holding immature oocytes andcould provide an alternative method for generalpractitioners. 12Once collected, the immature oocytes can be placed in either a 2-mL Nalgene cryogenic tube or 1-mL borosilicate glass vialelled with the chosen medium and maintained at room temperature, taking care to minimize air within thetube. It is recommended to wrap the lid with plas-tic parafn lm fas extra security against leakage during transport. This container should then be placed into a larger container, such as a conical tube,also lled with the same media with the lid wrappedin plastic parafn lm ffor extra leakage prevention. These immature oocytes can then be sent in a por- table incubator set at approximately 22\u00b0C,ca pas - sive cooling deviceawith the coolant cans removed to maintain stable room temperature or an immatureoocyte specic container g. This technique could provide an alternative method for equine practitio- ners, adept at postmortem oocyte harvesting, forshipping the to a laboratory offering ICSIand reduce the stress afliated with emergencyovary shipment. The number of oocytes that can be collected per mare is variable and primarily depends on the num-ber of follicles present on the ovaries. When oocytes were collected from mares of various agesand reproductive activity, an average of 11 oocyteswere collected per mare. 13However, in our labora - tory, we have collected as many as 30 oocytes fromthe occasional mare, and no oocytes from mares withno follicular activity. In general, approximatelyhalf of recovered oocytes will mature in vitro and proceed to ICSI. Of that cohort, approximately 30-50% will cleave and begin to develop into an embryo.Finally, approximately half of the early embryoswill continue to develop into quality blastocystsworthy of nonsurgical embryo transfer. Manyfactors will affect these projections, some of whichinclude mare age, duration and severity of illness,quality of semen, environmental factors, and ship-ping conditions. 4. Discussion Offering postmortem ovary extraction and shipmentto a laboratory established in equine ICSI can pro-vide an important avenue for practices with clienteleinterested in the procedure (Fig 4). As mentionedthroughout this article, time is one of the most im-portant factors toward the success of this procedure.Preparing supplies and enacting a plan before theemergency phone call can also make a signicantdifference. If a practitioner is comfortable and hasprevious experience in scraping and processing post-mortem equine ovaries, shipping the oocytes to alaboratory with ICSI capabilities is the most ideal Fig. 4.

Several facilities across the contiguousUnited States offer this service and ICSI-producedembryos can often be transferred into a recipientmare at that facility, transported to another facilityfor transfer closer to the owner, or vitried for trans-fer at a later date. Between the advancement inreproductive technologies, the widening availability,and success at various locations, horse ownersshould understand that they have the opportunity topreserve important genetics for future generationsin the face of a catastrophic event. This paper isintended to provide enough details for a practitionerto feel comfortable in the removal and shipment ofovaries from a deceased mare to offer this procedureto interested clientele.

Mares are notorious for variable gestationlengths, and may foal normally as early as 320 days orafter more than 365 days. 1Given that the majority of mares (83%) foal out between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.,usually between 9:00 and 11:00 p.m. or 2:00 and 6:00a.m. (Fig. 1), 2owners may spend many nights moni- toring a mare before she foals. Traditionally foaling managers track physical changes in the mare to determine when parturitionis imminent. Many mares will \"bag up,\" or showmammary development in the weeks before foaling.Hormonal changes such as an increase in relaxinlead to relaxation of the pelvic ligaments, and elon-gation and softening of the vulva, which also signalimpending parturition (Fig. 2). Typically, mareswill or show precolostral secretion accu-mulation on their teats in the hours to days beforefoaling. Unfortunately, multiparous mares mayshow some of these changes more than a week before foaling, and maiden mares may show almost nochanges, or change very suddenly before foaling. The electrolyte composition of mammary secretions has been used to monitor for impending parturition inmares carrying normal pregnancies for years. 3-6 A decrease in sodium, increase in potassium, and in-crease in calcium and magnesium have all been dem- Fig. 1. Time of foaling in Thoroughbred mares (1090 parturi-tions). Adapted from 2 /H114082016 187HOW TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MARE NOTESonstrated to be useful parameters to predict fetaldevelopment and the onset of parturition. 3-6More recently, a study out of Japan demonstrated a de-crease in pH from mammary-gland secretions imme-diately before foaling, 7and a second study out of central Kentucky conrmed these ndings and showed an association between mammary-gland elec-trolytes and pH. 5Since those two studies came out, we have incorporated the assessment of pH from pre- foaling mammary secretions into our clinical foalingprogram the past 3 years and have found it to be areliable method to predict impending parturition.We have observed three particular trends in pHchanges/proles in mares in clinical practice, and heredescribe our experiences and present some novel un-reported patterns for the pH prole in normal pre-foaling mares. In addition, we also discuss variousmethods to determine pH and associations betweenpre-foaling electrolytes of the mammary gland and pH.Our overall objective is to provide a clinical paper toallow other equine practitioners to effectively use pHto monitor normal periparturient mares. Mammary-Gland Electrolytes in Pre-Foaling pre-foaling mg/dL),magnesium (30-40 mg/dL), and potassium (40 mg/dL), sodium (20 mg/dL) and chloride(20 mg/dL). 5,8Most mares present an inversion in the concentrations of sodium and potassium in the 1-2 days before foaling.8,5At the same time, mam - mary secretions change from a clear to yellow seroussecretion to a thicker, cloudier, whiter secretion. A seminal study out of England assessed changes in mammary-gland electrolytes and described a so-dium and potassium inversion, with potassium lev-els increasing, and sodium levels decreasing beforefoaling 8(Fig. 3 ). However, this inversion is not consistently seen in all mares, and is highly vari-able. 3,6Protein, lactose, and calcium also increasepre-foaling, and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) has been shown to be both a specic and sensitive pre- dictor of foaling within a 72-hour period, given thatCaCO 3increases dramatically in the normal mare before foaling.6Work by Ley and collaborators sug - gests that mares with a CaCO3less than 200 ppm are unlikely to foal within 24 hours. The kit tested by Ley and collaborators,6and similar kits measure calcium carbonate by a reaction with a zinc salt and a color indicator (zincon). These kits have beenpopular in North America for years for monitoringone or few foaling mares. The commercial kits available are considerably expensive, especially when monitoring multiplemares, and require at least 0.5-3 mL to allow accu-rate assessment of calcium carbonate. Unfortu-nately, some maiden mares may provide only a fewmicroliters of mammary-gland secretion, and somemares may foal unnoticed if the observer is not test-ing the secretions. Commercial water hardnessstrips are available as a cheaper and effectivemethod of estimating calcium in mammary secre-tions. 5,9,10These test strips detect calcium and magnesium that form a complex with disodium eth- ylenedinitrilo tetraacetic acid and causes a changein strip color from green to violet. The strips con-tain four or ve squares, and concentrations areestimated from the number of squares that change Fig. 2. Classic physical changes in a periparturient mare close to parturition. On the left, a pronounced mammary gland is noted,in the center picture, the examiner is holding the dorsal aspect of the labia to demonstrate vulvar softening and elongation.

However, given that the strips measuremagnesium as well as calcium, results may be lessaccurate than the test kits as magnesium also grad-ually increases in milk secretions pre-foaling. 5 Calcium carbonate levels have been incorporated into the criteria that most clinicians utilize if decid-ing to induce parturition in mares. Two studies outof Italy have demonstrated the usefulness of mea-suring calcium and then administering low doses of oxytocin, 11,12and clinicians have incorporated milk calcium levels as one criterion to help assess when induction of parturition will result in a viablefoal. 4,13,14Some clinicians, when presented with a situation in which induction of parturition is war- ranted, are comfortable inducing a mare when themare meets the following criteria: soft and relaxedcervix, at least 320 days of gestation, and mammary-gland secretions with calcium carbonate of 200 ppm.A recent study out of New York 14incorporated the presence of acidic mammary-gland secretions (pH /H11349 6.5) into their foaling induction criteria with appar-ent success. Mares with placental pathology exhibit abnormal electrolyte proles; thus, electrolytes are not reliablein these mares. 15At this time, we do not have enough data to provide meaningful information on pH values in cases of abnormal placental pathology.It is our clinical impression based on a small numberof cases ( /H1101110 clinical cases) that pH does change during times of fetal stress or impending abortion. 2. Materials and Methods Obtaining the Sample and Methods for Determining pH The rst time pre-foaling mammary-gland secre- tions are collected from a mare can be a challenge forcertain patients. Most mares will display signs ofdiscomfort by swishing the tail up and down andkicking at the operator. To safely milk a mare, oneexperienced handler should restrain the mare'shead. In fractious or nervous mares intolerant tothe procedure, a lip chain may be warranted. Theauthors recommend approaching the mare from theleft side, placing the left hand on the mare's hipwhile the right hand slowly touches the ventral as-pect of the abdomen. Some mares may become toodangerous; therefore, the practitioner may opt tosedate the mare for the rst time until the mare isused to being touched. Before milking a mare forthe rst time, it is advisable to clean the two udderhalves with warm cotton and dry with a paper towel.We prefer to milk the mare using a conical 50-mLtube or a disposable Dixie cup. We prefer to holdthe tube or cup with three ngers and milk the mare Fig. 4. Example of milking a pre-foaling mare using the one-handed technique and a 50-mL conical tube. Fig. 5.

Followingcollection, the milk sample should have the pH as-sessed by one of the methods described below. It isunknown for how long after collection pH can still beaccurately assessed; thus, we recommend measur-ing pH within 15 minutes. Determining pH with test strips has the advan- tage that strips require minimal secretions. This isparticularly useful for maiden mares that have verysmall amounts available to be tested, even on theday of foaling. Overall, pH meters are more accu-rate than most pH strip tests; 5however, pH meters are more expensive and oftentimes not readily avail- able, or easily broken in ambulatory practices (Fig. 5).If the practitioner elects to use pH strips over pHmeter, the strips should have a pH range from 5.5 to8 units, and have readings with increments of 0.1 or0.2 units. Unfortunately, commonly available pHstrip tests usually read in increments of 0.5 to 1 unitof pH. These strips are not accurate enough todetect the slight changes needed to determine im-pending parturition. Some test strips a(Fig. 5A), have been shown to be highly (r /H110050.93) and signif- icantly correlated with pH meter5and are suggested for use by the authors. There are several pH meters on the market. One company has a meterbcoupled with a small micro - convex electrode allowing determination of verysmall quantities; however, this meter is more expen-sive and probably best used for research rather thanclinical practice (Fig. 5B). 5The meter currently used by the authors is a relatively cheap handheld meter designed for testing water pH (Fig. 5C).Before each reading, the meter is calibrated to a pH7 standard, and then rinsed thoroughly with dis-tilled water, and tapped dry. Approximately 500-1000 /H9262L of mammary-gland secretion is then placed in the sample well, and the pH of the secretions aremeasured. After measurement, the pH meter isagain thoroughly rinsed with distilled water andallowed to dry.3. Results pH Prole Normal prefoaling secretions have a pH of 8.0-8.5 that then decreases in the weeks to days beforefoaling from 8.0 to 7.5, and eventually to 6.5 or lowerat time of foaling. Based on our experiences overthe past 3 years using pH of the mammary gland-secretions in approximately 100 mares (Thorough-breds, Standardbreds, Quarter Horses, Warm-bloods, and a number of mixed-breed mares, age4-23 yrs), we have been able to identify three pro-les as described below. Pattern 1 In our experiences, we observe this pattern mostcommonly in maiden or young broodmares. Marespresenting with this pH pattern may show discreteto no mammary-gland development until 24-48hours before parturition, when sudden mammary-gland development is noted. There is a simultane-ous decrease in pH from a slightly alkaline (e.g., 7.5) Fig. 6. Pattern 1 (Fast pH reduction). This is most commonly observed in maiden and younger broodmares. It is characterized bya fast decrease in pH from a slight alkaline pH (e.g., /H110117.5) to a slightly acidic pH (e.g., 6.5-6.8). These mares may not have any expressible mammary-gland secretions before sudden mammary-gland development and a decrease in pH. These mares will foalwithin the rst 24 h that pH turns acidic. Fig. 7.

TO TREAT THE SUB-FERTILE MAREto slightly in the next day (e.g., 6.6-6.8), withmares usually foaling that night (Fig. 6). Based onour experiences, this type of mare will show theclassic sodium/potassium inversion before foaling asdescribed by Ousey and others, 8and an associated decrease in milk pH, increase in calcium and mag- nesium, and reduction in chloride5(Figs. 7 and 8). These mares may decrease from a pH of approxi-mately 8 to slightly alkaline pH of 7.5, and thenbelow 7.0 at time of foaling. 5Mares that drop very rapidly (by /H113500.5 in 24 h) may be 7.0 in the morning, and be 6.5 or lower at foaling that night. Pattern 2 In our clinic, most mares following pattern 2 areolder multiparous broodmares or older maidenmares carrying a foal for the rst time (e.g., 15-23y). These mares do present mammary-gland devel-opment several days before parturition, and may have mammary secretions with elevated calciumseveral days they maresmay exhibit a sodium/potassium inversion and anassociated decrease in milk pH, but do not foal forseveral days to weeks after an acidic pH has beenachieved. These mares will decrease to 7.5, andthen below 7.0, and gradually decrease to below 6.5,and may not foal for a week afterward, or until thepH is 6.2 (Fig. 9). These mares also seem topresent more problems such as dysmature foals,dummy foals, and slow foals. In our clinical ex-perience, these mares may be the ones havingdysmature foals or other peripartum complica-tions, but we also have observed several normalmares presenting this pattern. Pattern 3 This is a very uncommon pattern for pH. Mares inthis category will foal with high and alkaline pH(7.5-8) (Fig. 10), will not a sodium/potas-sium inversion in mammary secretions (Fig. 11),and secretions calcium and magne-sium and high chloride. 5This pattern may be ob - served in older or younger mares and it does notseem to be associated with other problems, giventhat foals born from these mares are reported tohave normal passive transfer of maternal antibodiesthrough colostrum. 5 4. Final Considerations and Conclusion The addition of mammary secretion pH to the mon-itoring of peripartum mares not only provides an-other means for clinicians to assess imminent labor,but may also help provide a more accurate picture offetal maturation. It has been suggested that mam-mary electrolytes change with fetal maturation, andthe same pattern seems to apply to mammary pH.Clinicians that are using mammary electrolytes to Fig. 8. Calcium elevation pre-foaling in mares for patterns 1(red line, mare foaling with low pH and high calcium), and pat-tern 3 (blue line, when mare foals with alkaline pH and lowcalcium levels). Fig. 9. Representative samples from mares presenting pattern 2. This pattern is characterized by a slow reduction in pH. Oncethe pH of pre-foaling secretions is acidic, mares will foal when pH is around 6.2. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 191HOW TO of parturition maynd the combination of electrolytes and pH a morereliable indicator of fetal maturity. Collection of daily mammary secretions, even for up to 3 weeks before foaling, does not seem to neg-atively affect colostrum quality. In our clinic,mares with prolonged decreases in mammary pHbefore foaling were mares at higher risk for dysmatureor critically ill foals, and with more data, these pro-longed decreases in pH may be an indication of whento expect intervention at foaling, or a high-risk foaling. In summary, mammary-secretion pH is a useful test for imminent foaling, and can be measured withthe use of a simple test strip or with a pH metercapable of measuring many samples without theneed for replacement parts, given that is neededwith commercial milk calcium test kits. Althoughthe majority of mares will demonstrate a sharp de-crease in pH in the 24 hours before foaling, there aresome mares that experience a decrease in pH daysbefore foaling, or such a sudden decrease that it may be missed with once a day pH sampling.

Introduction Hemospermia can occur consistently or intermit-tently and has been described as a factor associ-ated with infertility/subfertility in stallions. Theaim of this study was to evaluate the effects of twolevels (low and high) of blood contamination (5%and 50% v/v, respectively) of stallion semen onfertility. 2. Materials and Methods Twenty-four reproductively sound mares and onefertile stallion were included in the study. Eachmare was inseminated on three consecutive es-trous cycles with one of three randomly assignedtreatments consisting of 10 mL of previously centri-fuged and extended semen containing 250 /H1100310 6total sperm with 0% (T0; control), 5% (T5), or 50% (T50)(v/v) blood. Pregnancy was diagnosed by transrectalultrasonography at 14 days post-ovulation.3. Results Pregnancy rates did not differ between Groups T0 (18/24; 75%) and T5 was re-duced ( P/H110220.05). 4. Discussion The amount of blood in an ejaculate is difcult to estimate based on the gross color change. Forexample, pink-tinged ejaculates contain /H110211% and 50%blood (v/v) are both red in appearance. Thismakes it difcult to visually estimate theamount of blood contamination in an ejaculate, andthus whether it will adversely affect fertility. Al-though 5% blood contamination did not de-crease fertility, the minimum level of blood contam-ination required to reduce fertility is notknown.

Introduction Equine veterinarians may become involved in failureof an equine rescue as the rescue's veterinarian, acommunity veterinarian, or when notied that a largegroup of horses need immediate assistance. Collapseof a large equine sanctuary, retirement farm, or failedhorse farm may be very similar. Based on the veter-inarian's oath, there is an ethical responsibility to pro-vide professional expertise to improve the animals'welfare. There are also legal responsibilities to con-sider. The scope of a veterinarian's role will dependon the circumstances, the number of veterinariansthat can be mobilized to triage and treat the animals,and realistically, assessment of the time commitmentand lost revenue. Communities and clients expectveterinarians to lead efforts to address both the imme-diate needs of the animals and any other healthabnormalities. With experience and training, veteri-narians can meet that expectation and greatly affectthe outcome for the horses. Very few clients arelikely to protest if a veterinarian reports a rescue thathas mistreated the animals, even if the rescue is thatveterinarian's client.2. Methods Veterinarians may take on a role in resolution offailure of an equine rescue at several stages.First, the rescue may be the veterinarian's client,but educational efforts to improve the horses' wel-fare failed. The veterinarian may be familiarwith the farm or suspect trouble on the basis ofanimals that are brought into the equine clinic.Similarly, a veterinary client or concerned volun-teer may insist that the veterinarian intervenebased on what that person has observed or heard.The rst notice of trouble may be a call from ahumane agent, animal control ofcer, or law en-forcement who may ask the veterinarian to look atthe animals and provide a professional opinion.After a decision has been made that the animalsmust be seized or surrendered, a veterinarian maybecome involved in triaging the multiple medicalissues that are often present as well as document-ing the condition of the animals. All entry pointsneed the veterinarian to be a strong advocate forthe horses' welfare. There are legal ramicationsthat must be reviewed given that ndings at any AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 195EMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BAD NOTESentry point stage may quickly evolve into a crim-inal investigation. What is the denition of animal cruelty in the state? Failure to provide adequate feed, water, andshelter as well as basic health care are unfortu-nately common in cases of rescue failures. Thesefailures may be dened as acts of omission thatjustify legal intervention. Many states include ne-glect under the denition of animal cruelty. 1Anal - ysis of the situation may also suggest that theresponsible person ts the denition of hoarding,which is often linked to mental illness. 2 When a veterinarian becomes aware that animal welfare has been compromised at an equine rescueor client's farm, the rst step is to review reportingrequirements for the state. Veterinary techniciansare affected by legal requirements in many states aswell. The American Veterinary Medical Associa-tion provides an excellent resource that is frequentlyupdated and easily accessible (Fig. 1). a This web site provides ve key pieces of informa- tion for each state: 1) who must or should reportsuspected cruelty; 2) whether reporting is manda-tory, voluntary, or not required; 3) what are report-able offenses; 4) civil immunity, if any, for good faithreporting; and 5) to whom suspected cruelty shouldbe reported. The site also provides links to thespecic state statutes or rules for additional detail. Among the details, the veterinarian should nd andreview the state's denition of cruelty, and any lawthat pertains to a veterinarian's role in investigationand documentation of cruelty. Increasingly, statesare enacting legislation that recognizes that animalcruelty and neglect are linked to abuse and crueltyto people and mental health. Law enforcementshould be aware of this link and anticipate the po-tential need for a two-pronged investigation. Leg-islative updates on bills under consideration or new laws about animal abuse are provided monthly bythe National LINK Coalition via the free e-newsletter,The LINK-Letter (www.nationallinkcoalition.org). In reporting suspected cruelty, regulations on the condentiality of medical records should be consid-ered based on the wording in the state's veterinarypractice act. Relinquishing records to law enforce-ment or humane agents may be allowed or requireeither owner permission or a subpoena from lawenforcement. State practice acts can be retrievedquickly on the American Association of VeterinaryState Board's Web site (www.aavsb.org) by selectingthe \"Board and Agency Directory\" option. Afterchoosing the state or province, the site provides thelink to the practice act and rules. Once the PDF isopened, a simple shortcut to nd the pertinent lan- Fig. 1.

Alternatively, the board's staff maybe able to answer the questions. Condentialityconstraints on medical records, investigative data,or ongoing legal processes may also apply to mediainterviews about the rescue collapse. A phone call to law enforcement, humane agent, or animal control ofcer to report neglect and/orcruelty can be followed up with a signed afdavit tolaw enforcement. This should be a statement of themedical history and facts, signed by the veterinarianand witnessed by a notary. The afdavit shouldrequest action. If there is no action, the afdavitcan be taken up the chain of command. When a veterinarian is asked to accompany law enforcement, humane agents, or animal control of-cers to go onto a farm for a possible cruelty investi-gation, legal preparation is required. In moststates, a search warrant is needed rst. The veter-inarian might otherwise be trespassing, and unableto look at the animals. The link between animalhoarding, mental illness, and at times human abuseis another reason to make a joint visit with lawenforcement. 2,3In addition, observations made without a search warrant may not be admissible in criminal cases. Criminal investigation of the rescue's managers or owners may be necessary and is best accomplishedwith input from both law enforcement and a veter-inarian with forensic training. Accuracy and com-pleteness of a veterinarian's report is critical forsuccessful prosecution. 1Depending on the state's laws, neglect, abuse, or intentional cruelty to horsesmay be a misdemeanor or felony offense. Maxi-mum sentences for a person convicted of animalcruelty are also highly variable, and may depend onfactors such as demonstrable intent, permanentharm, mortality, and previous animal crueltycharges against the individual. Unfortunately,some states have no animal cruelty laws whatsoeveror jurisdictions may choose to not enforce the laws. Veterinarians that are recruited to triage and treat surrendered or seized horses must be aware ofthe denitions of cruelty, neglect, and abuse for thatstate as well. Language chosen in medical reportsshould reflect the language in those denitions.The presence of infectious diseases such as stranglesmay be reportable to the state veterinarian as wellas affect whether the animals should be sheltered inplace, not moved to a state or county fairgrounds, orkept in isolation facilities at a veterinary clinic. Licensing requirements must be heeded if the vet- erinarian will be working temporarily on the scene.Some states may allow a veterinarian licensed inanother state to work as a consultant under thesupervision of a veterinarian licensed in that state.Alternatively, the state practice act may make ex-ceptions for emergency situations. These legal pro-visions should be ascertained before beginning workwith the surrendered or seized animals. The state's law may also dene who seized animals be-long to. This may be important for obtaining con-sent for treatment. Requirements for medical records should be kept in mind when evaluating the animals. State prac-tice acts and rules may be quite detailed about whatshould be included. In a forensic investigation,even more detail and photographs are critical forsuccessful prosecution. Adequate support staff tomeet these needs should be planned in advance ifpossible. Equine specic evaluation forms areavailable from the American Society for the Preven-tion of Cruelty to Animals veterinary investigationteam. Original records from triaged horses mayneed to legally remain with the veterinarian, inwhich case copies can be provided to law enforce-ment for cruelty prosecution if necessary. Authority to euthanize animals may be specied in state regulations. Specic criteria may need tobe met for euthanasia and should be documented inthe record for the animal. If multiple horses needto be euthanized, regulations pertaining to carcassdisposal must also be considered and may influencethe choice of method for euthanasia. If a forensic necropsy is needed, taking the remains to a diagnos-tic laboratory is ideal, but removal of \"evidence\" mayalso be under legal constraints and require writtenpermission of law enforcement. Responsibility for the cost of veterinary evalua- tion and treatment of the horses may be found instate regulations. Local or county governmentfunds, however, may not be sufcient for veterinaryexpenses or upkeep of the seized animals. This isimportant to understand and reinforce with localofcials. In counterpoint, this need to be paid forprofessional expertise in an economically challengedarea may discourage a request for veterinary ser-vices. The cost of housing seized horses may alsofall on the municipality and further discourage tak-ing action such as removing the horses. Nonprotorganizations may be able to contribute funds, vol-unteers, feed, transportation, and facilities. Moti-vated clients may be willing to use social media tohelp raise funds as well. A quick check with the veterinarian's liability in- surance provider before beginning the work may beprudent to determine coverage and ask whether aliability waiver for non-employees is needed. Thelikelihood of injury escalates if there are stallionsand other horses that cannot be handled. Relocation of large numbers of horses into foster care or other rescues may be challenging and re-quire a coordinated effort between multiple re-sponding organizations. Veterinarians should befamiliar with requirements for health certicatesfor interstate travel if such will be required.Some form of medical record sharing with newcaretakers should be pursued, even if it is not thefull forensic le. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 197EMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BADThe nal legal piece for consideration is the vet- erinarian's role in prosecution. The district attor-ney's advice should be followed in both preparationof reports and court testimony. Cases of equinecruelty that were successfully prosecuted are avail-able through animal welfare organizations. Thesecan guide those who are not familiar with strategiesfor successful prosecution. 4 3. Discussion and Conclusions A veterinarian can more effectively assist a largenumber of horses surrendered by or seized from afailed rescue by becoming familiar with the legaldetails for that state. A group of informed veteri-narians in a state can more rapidly form a cohesiveteam. Preplanning for such an emergency at thelevel of a state veterinary association or animalhealth agency can include a manual with a sum-mary of these parameters as well as protocols. 5 An incident command system can be established orencompassed by the state's disaster or emergencyveterinary medical assistance team. However, le-gal role denitions must be incorporated in the or-ganization of the team and decision making. Thisframework could also include a designated mediaspokesperson that is familiar with the legal con-straints on condential information. 2 Local equine veterinarians are critical to resolu- tion of the failed rescue's equine welfare crisis.These practitioners are most likely to know the lawenforcement ofcers, sites for temporary housing,and potential volunteers to assist with the task, ifvolunteers are needed or allowed. This veterinari-an's input is critical even if the local practitionercannot dedicate a large amount of time to the effort.This veterinarian is likely to be the rst person torealize that the number of horses exceeds local ca-pacity for veterinary care and housing. Calls toveterinarians and organizations with training inlarge-scale equine humane seizures should be madeearly in the process. Invaluable advice and addi-tional resources may be available. Positive working relationships with law enforce- ment and humane ofcers are very important andrequire nurturing. 6Law enforcement may have lit - tle knowledge of horse husbandry and fail to recog-nize underfeeding, signs of disease, and abnormal behavior. The veterinarian must then also take onthe role of educating law enforcement on standardsof care to persuade law enforcement leadership totake action. Support from organizations and veterinarians with strong backgrounds in humane investigationsshould be sought as early as possible. Veterinaryforensics is a rapidly evolving eld with signicantoverlay with human crime investigation. Animalcruelty, abuse, and neglect are linked to humancruelty, abuse, and neglect. Mental health profes-sionals can be a valuable addition to the interven-tion team.

Introduction Veterinary forensic medicine is an emerging andrapidly developing branch of veterinary medicine.It is essential for veterinarians to be involved incases of animal maltreatment, given that veterinar-ians are and should be the leaders for setting thehighest standards for animal welfare in society.Not only does society demand the investigation ofcrimes against animals, but crimes against animalsaffect more than just animals. There is a strongand established link between human violence andanimal cruelty. Crimes against animals can be awarning sign of future violent acts, and individualswho witness animal cruelty can become desensitizedto violence. Animal abuse may also occur in con-junction with other crimes such as domestic violenceand the illegal sales of drugs and guns. Havingtaken an oath, veterinarians have a duty not only toprotect and serve animals but humans as well.Violence is a public health matter. By addressinganimal abuse, veterinarians have the potential to save human and animal life as well as reduce suf-fering. Opportunities are increasingly available forveterinarians to educate themselves on these topics.Both a Graduate Certicate and Master's Degree inVeterinary Forensic Sciences are now available on-line through the University of Florida. In addition,more veterinary schools are beginning to offer elec-tive courses in the area of veterinary forensic med-icine and publications on the topic have becomemore plentiful. Veterinarians play a critical role in animal abuse cases, encompassing an array of duties within thecontext of veterinary forensic sciences. Veterinaryforensic science is the application of a broad spec-trum of sciences, including veterinary medicine, toanswer questions of interest to a court of law. Theterm \"forensic medicine\" is used to encompass allaspects of forensic work of a medical nature. In thepast, this term was often used interchangeably with AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 199EMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BAD NOTES\"forensic pathology.\" Forensic pathology, however,refers to the branch of forensic medicine that dealswith death investigations. More recently, the term\"clinical forensic medicine\" is applied to the branchof forensic medicine involving the living. There is a spectrum of the levels of animal mal- treatment, most laws use the term, \"cruelty,\" butmaltreatment may also be described as \"abuse\" or\"neglect.\" Legal denitions of these terms varyfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction but in general theterm, \"abuse\" refers to the willful failure to providecare and harmful behaviors that result in maltreat-ment regardless of the intent, motivation, or mentalcondition of the perpetrator. 1Whereas \"cruelty\" implies more deliberate infliction of pain from which the abuser derives enjoyment or amusement2, \"ne - glect\" tends to be the most commonly encounteredform of maltreatment and refers to the failure toprovide care or an act of omission, as opposed tocruelty, which would be an act of commission. 2. The Evolution of a Case Veterinarians may be approached by law enforce-ment or a humane agent to assist with a caseinvestigation or may come across a suspected orknown case of abuse during the regular course oftheir day. This may take the form of a rescuethat has exceeded its capacity to care. For exam-ple, in April 2009, a large-scale rescue of 211horses was accomplished by cooperation betweenseveral groups, both national and local. The res-cue started off with the goal of being a sanctuaryfor Bureau of Land Management (BLM) mustangsthat had gone through three adoption events with-out nding a home. These animals, deemed \"un-adoptable,\" faced life in a holding pen, or possiblyillegally being sent to slaughter. This sanctuarymeant to give these horses, and others whose own-ers could no longer care for them, an alternativeplace to go. However, things began to go wrongas the horse population climbed and funds andhay became limited. A mid-April investigation spawned by Internet chatter, concerned and observant neighbors, dili-gent veterinarians, county law ofcials, and oth-ers uncovered the grisly truth that at least 74head of dependent horses and burros were allowedto starve to death during the winter. Followingthis discovery, 211 head of horses, mules, anddonkeys in varied but serious stages of neglectwere rescued from the premises. Law enforce-ment flew over the rescue, spotting two pits lledwith horse carcasses and other scattered remains.BLM ofcials were alerted and went to the ranch,conscating one emaciated BLM horse and learn-ing that another three were dead. A charge offelony animal cruelty was led, resulting in thejailing of the owner. Fortunately, the organizations involved had al- ready developed extensive databases of trained vol-unteers who could be called upon to respond whenneeded, along with a list of each volunteer's creden- tials, training, and expertise. This is one of thekeys to dealing with large-scale animal disasters,whether natural or man made. Veterinarians mustget involved by reaching out to local and state gov-ernment disaster-relief agencies and state veteri-nary medical associations, as well as nonprots andlarge-animal technical rescue groups that are devel-oping in many states. This case relied on over 700volunteers as well as a team of dedicated veterinar-ians and veterinary students. 3. Recognizing Abuse Veterinarians are not traditionally trained toidentify features that raise the index of suspicionof animal abuse or signs consistent with or highlysuggestive of abuse. In addition, veterinariansoften fall into the trap of thinking that owners whocare enough about their animals to provide veter-inary care are unlikely to abuse their animals.This is simply not the case. The largest barrier todiagnosing abuse is the existence of emotionalblocks in the minds of veterinary professionals.These can be so powerful that they prevent thediagnosis from even being considered in obviouscases. The most important step in diagnosinganimal abuse is to force oneself to consider this asa differential diagnosis. For many equine veterinarians, abuse will likely be observed or suspected on the farm as opposed toin a clinic setting with other people around. Howthe situation is approached depends on the relation-ship with the client. But do not forget to treat theanimal rst. Although a crime may have been (oris being) committed, do not compromise timely treat-ment of the animal. A conversation with the clientmay shed some light, such as indications that theabuser may be a spouse or signicant other. Tak-ing thorough notes, and possibly photographs, if thiscan be done without arousing suspicion from theclient, is helpful; however, be aware of getting your-self into a situation that may become volatile orunsafe. If the circumstances do not allow for docu-mentation at the farm, do a thorough examinationwith detailed medical records as normal, address thepresenting complaint, and make additional noteswhen you leave the farm. It is important to note that animal abuse is a legal, not medical, determination. Just because aveterinarian may believe that an act qualies asabuse does not mean that the law recognizes it assuch. Therefore, the veterinarian must be familiarwith the applicable laws in order to make an in-formed opinion as to whether an act or omission mayqualify as abuse, but ultimately this is the determi-nation of the prosecuting attorney. When report-ing potential or suspected animal abuse it is not theduty of the veterinarian to identify suspects or de-termine guilt or innocence. All known or suspectedcases should be reported, allowing for law enforce-ment to investigate and for the prosecuting attorney 200 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BADto determine whether charges should be broughtforth. Ultimately, the judge or jury decides guilt orinnocence. Therefore, if abuse is suspected, itshould be reported. Unfortunately, many veterinarians are unaware of the appropriate authorities to whom they shouldreport and such authorities vary from state to stateand even from locality to locality within a givenstate, 3thus inhibiting the ease with which veteri - narians are expected to report known or suspectedanimal abuse. 3To alleviate this issue veterinari - ans should take a proactive response to reportingabuse and determine the appropriate authority towhom they should report prior to facing a known orsuspected case of abuse. Veterinary forensic science is essential to the prosecution of animal abuse and therefore lawenforcement should involve a veterinarian in ev-ery case. The veterinarian's role in potentialcases of animal abuse is multifaceted includingcrime scene investigation, the examination of liveand deceased animals, authoring a forensic veter-inary statement, and the provision of expert wit-ness testimony. Expert witness testimony willnot be addressed here as it is covered elsewhere inthese proceedings by Frederickson. 4Unfortu - nately, most veterinarians have little to no train-ing in forensic science but must at least have anunderstanding of their role and how to identify,collect, and preserve evidence before assistingwith a potential case of animal abuse. It is alsoimportant for veterinarians to understand thatthey should not extend beyond their skill set butinstead recognize when to utilize other profession-als as needed. Most veterinary forensic caseswill involve a multidisciplinary approach, includ-ing assistance from other specialists such as pa-thologists, forensic toxicologists, and radiologists. 4. Assisting in a Large-Scale Investigation Animal cruelty cases, particularly on a large scale,can involve many agencies on many different levels.Without a structured system, this can become verychaotic. The Incident Command System, estab-lished under the National Incident ManagementSystem, is a standardized, on-scene, all-hazards in-cident management approach that allows for thefollowing: 1. The integration of facilities, equipment, per- sonnel, procedures, and communications oper-ating within a common organizationalstructure 2. A coordinated response among various juris- dictions and functional agencies, both publicand private 3. Common processes for planning and manag- ing resources 5 The veterinarian(s) involved should be aware oftheir position within the Incident Command Systemand communicate effectively with law enforcement and any direct reports assigned to assist them. On a local level, veterinarians asked to be in- volved in a large-scale cruelty case will likely havecolleagues with whom they already have a rela-tionship, and a medical team can be developed.It is helpful to have made such contacts and de-velop a plan prior to an incident, so that this teamcan be pulled together quickly and efciently.Such a team might include individual veterinari-ans, veterinary clinics, vet schools and students,local rescue organizations, local emergency re-sponse personnel, and other individuals andgroups. This communication is also importantfor a plan moving forward after the animals areseized, given that they will need ongoing care,housing, and documentation of conditions and im-provement. It is also important to communicateclearly with incident command as to who will becovering payment for services rendered, coveringthe costs of diagnostic testing as recommended forhealth and evidentiary purposes, and the costs ofanimal care and housing post seizure and throughadjudication. When large-scale cases arise that exceed a locality's abilities or resources, there are a variety of nationalorganizations, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), whichcan provide direct (boots-on-the-ground) assis-tance to law enforcement at the local, state, andfederal level and can be tailored to t the needs athand. The ASPCA and others also provide grant funding to law enforcement across the country to sup- port their work in animal-abuse cases. For more infor-mation on assistance available at the ASPCA, pleasevisit www.aspcapro.org. The initial number of veterinarians needed on a case will depend on the number of animals, numberof scenes involved, and somewhat on the experienceof the veterinarians and the suspected condition ofthe animals. On scene, the forensic veterinarian isresponsible for the identication and documentationof animal evidence as well as non-animal medicalevidence. An on scene, treatment veterinarianmay also be necessary to focus on patient care, suchas handling critical animals, which may be sent to apredetermined facility off site after being stabilized.A federally accredited veterinarian should be onscene to perform Coggins testing and issue healthcerticates as needed. Moving forward into veterinary forensic examina- tions, a good rule of thumb is to have a veterinaryforensic team for every 50 equids to complete exam-inations within a few days depending on the extentof the medical conditions present. Ideally, theseteams would include a veterinarian, handler, tech-nician, and a scribe. The person responsible forphotographs (typically the veterinarian) should befamiliar with the equipment to obtain clear, usefulimages, which are an accurate depiction of theevidence. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 201EMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BAD5. Identication, Collection, and Preservation of Evidence To assist law enforcement with an investigation ofpotential animal abuse the veterinarian must un-derstand the basics of evidence identication, collec-tion and preservation. Evidence is generallydened as anything that can demonstrate or dis-prove a fact in contention. 6,7Such facts may be anticipated based on the applicable laws as well as prior experiences.7More specically, evidence is used to demonstrate guilt or innocence, to identify victims, and to identify suspects.6,7Care must be taken to ensure the integrity of each item of evi- dence, given that everything must be done with theultimate goal in mind to withstand scrutiny in thecourtroom. 7The veterinarian must recognize that their duty is to the court, assisting the trier of fact (the judge or the jury) in understanding the evidenceat hand and in effect, act as an advocate for thetruth. 7 To determine what may be important evidence in a given case, the crime scene and the forensic exam-ination should be approached within the context ofpotential criminal prosecution. 7Questions must be considered and answers sought within this context.7 Again, such questions will be based on the applica-ble laws, prior experiences, as well as specic ques-tions that law enforcement may be trying toaddress. 7 Veterinarians must be familiar with the process- ing of an animal crime scene, specically as it re-lates to their role on scene. Initially the scene willbe secured by law enforcement before anyone will beallowed on scene. 7Once the scene is secured, doc - umentation should begin and typically will occur inphases as follows. 7 Phase 1: Document the Condition in Which the Scene was Found Upon Arrival This should include overall photos and possiblyvideo of the areas covered under the search warrant.This phase is typically completed by lawenforcement. Phase 2: Documentation of Each Animal and Their Environment This phase can be further broken down into stages. Stage 1: Critical Triage Critical triage is conducted during the veterinari-an's initial walkthrough of the property. Triage onscene is a rapid, visual sorting of animals for exam-ination and treatment priority based on their med-ical condition. Critical triage is done to identifyanimals in immediate need of medical care and isthe responsibility of the veterinarian. Critical triage requires an expedited intake proce- dure to provide necessary and timely medical treat-ment. Intake requires assignment of a uniqueanimal identication number and documentation ofthe animal in situ. Documentation should include photographs as well as written notes. It is impor-tant to remember that each animal is an individualitem of evidence. In the case of a critical animalrequiring immediate treatment, this evidence willbe altered the moment treatment begins. Docu-ment the animal as thoroughly as possible prior tobeginning treatment, but obviously not at the ex-pense of causing the animal further distress (Fig. 1). Step 2: Intake Triage Following critical triage, noncritical animals shouldbe more closely assessed and their environment doc-umented. Intake triage should be conducted by theveterinarian during the second walkthrough of theproperty. It is imperative that the living conditionsof each animal not be altered in any way until theyhave been observed by a veterinarian, documented,and photographed. During intake triage, animals requiring a more in-depth assessment or treatment on scene prior totransport should be flagged. A simple color-codingsystem to use is red for critical animals, yellow foranimals that require further assessment and docu-mentation or treatment prior to transport, andgreen for animals that are ready for transport.Blue may be used for animals that are exhibitingsigns of infectious disease. These animals, unlesscritical, will then be handled last and transportedseparately, if possible. Ideally, there is an isolationarea set up in the barn or shelter that will be hous-ing the animals off site. Again, be sure to docu-ment as thoroughly as possible prior to initiatingany treatment on any animal, given that any evi-dence will be altered from this point forward. It is imperative to document each individual ani- mal's living conditions, given that they may holdinformation that will either contradict or corrobo-rate the animal's physical examination ndings(Figs. 2 and 5). Therefore, it is important to be ableto accurately illustrate the living conditions fromwhich each individual animal came and demon-strate how that environment may have directly af-fected the animal. This is especially true in cases ofneglect. Given this importance, the veterinarianmust take an active role in this documentation, in-cluding scene notes and photographs. If the veter-inarian is not the photographer, the veterinarianshould be actively directing the photographer to getthe necessary images. The veterinarian is the per-son who will also identify other details, such asquids of hay on the ground, or toxic plants eatendown along the fence line in a dry lot. In addition,the location of each animal will need to be docu-mented by either a sketch or other mapping tech-nique. This is ideally completed by a crime sceneanalyst or technician. Stage 3: Deceased Animals Deceased animals are considered noncritical and areoften given a non-animal physical evidence item 202 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BADnumber rather than an animal identication num-ber when seized in conjunction with live animals.Such a numbering system helps to eliminate confu-sion. If deceased horses are to be necropsied, theloading, transport, and location of necropsy shouldbe predetermined to avoid delay (Fig. 3). Stage 4: Post-Removal Photos Following the removal of each animal, more thor-ough documentation of the living space can be com-pleted. Mid-range and close-up photos of the livingspace should be completed once the animal has beenremoved. Such photos should include, but are notlimited to, any receptacles, presence or lack offood and water, quality of food and water, shelterand fence construction and possible hazards, feces,and urine (Fig. 4). It may also be necessary torecord the dimensions of the living enclosure in com-parison with the measurements of the animalhoused within the space. Such measurements canbe recorded on the sketch showing the location ofeach animal. In a group or pasture situation, besure to note the numbers and sizes of horses ex-pected to use one shelter. Phase 3: Non-Animal Evidence In addition to recognizing and documenting animalevidence, the forensic veterinarian may assist lawenforcement with the identication of non-animalmedical and also non-medical evidence. This couldinclude items such as medications, supplements andsurgical supplies, or identication of implementshaving certain purposes (Fig. 6). Some items ofevidence may be overlooked by law enforcement of-cers who are not familiar with the particular crimetype. Similarly, a forensic veterinarian can assistlaw enforcement with the potential evidentiaryvalue of an item, given that they may not be awareof an item's full evidentiary value. Phase 4: Document the Condition of the Scene Upon Exit This should include overall photos and possiblyvideo of the areas covered under the search war-rant. This phase is typically completed by lawenforcement. Evidence will also be identied, collected, and preserved during the forensic examination. Veter-inarians must be familiar with the necessary com-ponents of a forensic examination of both live anddeceased victims. A forensic medical examinationis a detailed and thorough examination performed tomethodically document examination ndings andfacilitate the collection of evidence from the patient'sbody. Like any other physical examination or nec-ropsy, this examination should be performed in asystematic manner, noting all normal and abnormalndings and evaluating all body systems. Thereshould also be a standard protocol for each animal.This protocol may vary from case to case dependingon the type and scale but the same protocol should be used for each animal in a given case. Forensic examinations should occur as soon as rational. They may occur on scene but tend to oc-cur more commonly off scene given the uncontrolledenvironment and lack of access to necessary equip-ment on scene. However, cursory or brief exams asmentioned previously may be conducted on scene toprovide necessary treatments prior to transport aswell as document transient evidence, such as milddehydration. Photographs are a fundamental component of a forensic examination. In addition to written notes,photographs should be obtained for several differentpurposes. 1. Identify the victim 2. Demonstrate the condition of the evidence at the time of discovery 3. Record and document evidence that cannot be preserved or left unaltered 4. Allow for later review of the evidence5. Document injuries or conditions and record what they looked like before and after medicalintervention 6. Illustrate and supplement a written report7. Demonstrate the absence or presence of al- leged ndings 8. Present in a court of law, the items of evidence as they were found, thereby validating thetestimony being presented 7,8 Forensic examination photos should be taken in aseries with the rst photo depicting a photo boardclearly stating the case number, date, location, oraddress where the photos are being taken, the ani-mal identication number and the photographer'sname. The second photo of the series should be ofthe animal with the photo board (Fig. 7). Subse-quent photos do not need to contain the photo boardbut may contain a smaller label as needed. Overallphotos should be the third step in the series, treat-ing the animal like a cube, obtain a photo of all sixsides of the animal, as allowable given the species.Overall photos should be followed by orientationphotos (Figs. 8 and 9). Any ndings should be pho-tographed in greater detail, starting with an orien-tation photo so the viewer understands where on thebody the nding is located. The orientation photois followed by a close-up photo with and without aforensic ruler. The scale or ruler serves variouspurposes but most importantly it demonstrates thatthe photo is a clear and accurate representation ofthe nding observed. This is performed by clearlyidentifying color, if any distortion is present andthat the photo is in focus. 7The forensic ruler also provides measurement.7It is important to note that photos should never be erased, if taken by mis- take or of poor quality, they should still be retained.7 Deleting images can create a gap in the metadatawhich could be called into question. 7 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 203EMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BADIn addition to being competent in the identica- tion of evidence on scene and on the body, the vet-erinarian also needs to be competent in thecollection and preservation of evidence. Evidenceis commonly lost as it may go undetected or disre-garded or fail to be properly collected or preserved.In order for evidence to be authenticated in court, itmust be accounted for at all times. This is done todemonstrate that the item was not tampered withand is in fact the item that was removed from thecrime scene or animal. In addition to witness tes-timony, a chain of custody and evidence packagingare used to demonstrate authentication. A chain ofcustody is the chronological documentation of everyperson who has had contact with the item from thetime it was seized until it is disposed of. This in-cludes how the item was packaged, the persons in-volved, dates, times, and purposes of all transfers.All items of evidence should be accompanied by theiroriginal evidence receipt or chain of custody. 7An example of a chain of evidence form is available at: http://aspcapro. org/resource/disaster-cruelty-animal- cruelty-animal-ghting/sample-documents-cruelty-cases. Items of evidence must be properly packaged to prevent loss or degradation. 7Reference manuals such as Crime Scene Investigation: A Guide forLaw Enforcement, published by the National Foren-sic Science Center should be consulted to ensureproper packaging. 7,9Evidence must also be prop - erly identied, labeled, and secured. The containerlabel should include the following: 1. The case number 2. The item number3. The investigating agency4. Location of collection5. Description of the item6. Name of the individual who collected the item7. The date and time the item was collected 7 To properly secure evidence, it should be properlysealed and stored. To seal an item of evidence, thepackage should be secured with frangible evidencetape, which bears the packager's initials and thedate the item was packaged. Care should be takenso that these items cross over the evidence tape ontothe package. Evidence should be stored in a securelocation with access restricted and monitored. Pro-tocols should be in place for evidence storage anditems should be signed in and out of storage. Evi-dence should not be disposed of until written consenthas been obtained from the submitting agency.Disposal should be documented on the original evi-dence receipt, which should be retained. 7 6. Forensic Veterinary Statement The veterinarian will determine an opinion based onthe facts of a case. These facts will come from thehistory, medical examination ndings, crime scenendings, diagnostic and forensic test results, as wellas potentially other sources. These facts will need to be proven in a nal report, which may be referredto as the forensic veterinary statement. The re-sponsibility to \"prove\" or \"disprove\" a case does notlie on the veterinarian. The case investigation is amultidisciplinary approach and veterinary evidence isonly part of the case. Ultimately, it is the prosecu-tor's duty to prove the case and the judge or juror'sduty to decide guilt or innocence. The veterinarianshould simply present the facts and their interpreta-tion or conclusions drawn from these facts. The purpose of the forensic veterinary statement is to clearly convey the facts of the case, which fallinto the veterinarian's area of expertise, to assist thejudge and/or jury in understanding the evidence athand. The forensic veterinary statement must ed-ucate the investigators, prosecutor or defense attor-ney, the judge, and the jury. Therefore, thisstatement is not necessarily directed toward otherveterinarians and must be easily understood by thelay audience it is intended for. The veterinarianmust ensure that the court understands the evi-dence while also acting as an advocate for the truth.However, the veterinarian must be aware of theirlimitations remaining within their area of expertise,understand the gaps in veterinary forensic science,and not extend beyond what the current scienceallows for us to state. The veterinarian must beimpartial and only draw conclusions based on whatthe evidence shows. Unfortunately, there is no standard format for the veterinary forensic statement; however, it is morethan just your physical examination ndings. Theauthors recommend that the following componentsbe included in the veterinary forensic statement in-volving live animals. 1. Introduction a.

Your target audience is the lay individual,such as law enforcement, lawyers, a judge or thejury rather than another veterinarian. You shoulduse appropriate medical terminology but explainwhat it means so that the lay reader can easilyunderstand your report. In addition, it may be ben-ecial to summarize ndings in conjunction withphotographs to enhance understanding and furtherillustrate the magnitude of the condition. If thereare numerous animals involved in a case considerusing a table or chart to summarize the ndings aswell. Such tables or charts may be useful for thejudge and/or jury and may serve as a reference dur-ing trial. Remember that all e-mails, photos, notes,and any other documents related to a case are dis-coverable and should be maintained and provided asrequested. With this in mind, you should alwaysapproach all aspects of the case in an unbiased andprofessional manner. All original documents andphotographs should be maintained. Feel free tomake clean copies of your notes but always retainthe originals. Photographs should be maintainedin a system in which they cannot be altered andprotocols should be in place for the handling of pho-tographic evidence, given that you may be ques-tioned about the integrity of your photos in court.Copies of photographs may be altered; however, youmust maintain the original unaltered copy and doc-ument all changes made.7. Conclusion The veterinarian has a multifaceted role within the investigation of a potential case of animal abuse, in-cluding crime scene investigation, the examination ofpotentially both live and deceased animals, authoringa forensic veterinary statement and the provision ofexpert witness testimony. The veterinarian may be-come involved in a case by either initiating an inves-tigation by reporting a suspected or known case ofanimal abuse or conversely may be asked by law en-forcement to assist with an investigation. Veterinar-ians must be familiar with the applicable animalcruelty laws in a given jurisdiction as well as haveknowledge of the appropriate law enforcement entityto which they should report suspected or known abuse.In addition, veterinarians assisting law enforcementwith a potential case of animal abuse must have athorough understanding of their role and how to iden-tify, collect, and preserve veterinary forensic evidence.

Introduction In prosecutions against individuals who have com-mitted criminal animal cruelty against equines, themost important witness is the equine veterinarian.Equine veterinarians are essential in charging andproving a case. This paper will describe what theprosecutor needs from the veterinarian. Speci-cally, this article will provide an overview of whatthe prosecutor has to prove, the importance of sub-mitting a good veterinarian report, the basics ofexpert witness testimony, and how to be an effectivewitness. This paper references Minnesota law;however, the laws are similar in most jurisdictionsand based upon the same constitutional require-ments; the concepts presented are applicable innearly every courtroom. a 2. An Overview of What a Prosecutor Has to Prove After a case of animal cruelty is investigated, theinvestigative materials are sent to a prosecutor forreview for criminal charges. The investigative ma-terials typically consist of law enforcement reports,veterinarian or veterinary pathologist reports, hu-mane agent reports, photographs, audio of inter-views, and video of the scene. Once the prosecutorbelieves that there is a sufcient amount of materi- als, he/she must determine whether there is proba-ble cause to charge a crime. \"'Probable cause'requires that there are sufcient facts such thatunder the circumstances, a person of ordinary careand prudence would entertain an honest and strongsuspicion that a crime has been committed.\" 1 A prosecutor must also determine what crime to charge, as well as the corresponding penalty. InMinnesota, there are three chapters with numeroussections that detail various crimes and penaltiesinvolving the treatment of animals. 2For instance, the general crime of animal cruelty in Minnesota \"isevery act, omission, or neglect which causes or per-mits unnecessary or unjustiable pain, suffering, ordeath.\" 3The prosecutor must prove that the abuser knew or should have known that his/her actionscaused the cruelty. In other words, a person cannotbe found guilty of animal cruelty if it was due to anunforeseeable or unpreventable accident. In addition to the crime, many states have differ- ent levels of penalties depending on the type ofharm. For instance, if the animal cruelty causedgreat bodily harm or death in Minnesota, the crime 208 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BAD NOTESis a felony.4\"'Great bodily harm' means bodily injury which creates a high probability of death, or which causes serious permanent disgurement, or whichcauses a permanent or protracted loss or impair-ment of the function of any bodily member or organ,or other serious bodily harm to a service animal or apet or companion animal.\" 5A felony may result in a prison sentence. If the act caused substantialbodily harm, the crime is a gross misdemeanor. 6 \"'Substantial bodily harm' means bodily injurywhich involves a temporary but substantial disg-urement, or which causes a temporary but substan-tial loss or impairment of the function of any bodilymember or organ, or which causes a fracture of anybodily member to a service animal or a pet or com-panion animal.\" 7Harm less than great or substan - tial is a misdemeanor.8Testimony from an equine veterinarian is necessary in determining the differ- ence between a gross misdemeanor or felony basedon level of harm, and a cause of death. After a case is charged, the prosecutor has to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, which isthe highest legal burden of proof. Minnesota lawdenes this burden as: \"Proof beyond a reasonabledoubt is such proof as ordinarily prudent men andwomen would act upon in their most important af-fairs. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based uponreason and common sense. It does not mean a fan-ciful or capricious doubt, nor does it mean beyond allpossibility of doubt.\" 9 Essentially, all the evidence presented by the prosecutor has to be consistent with the guilt of thedefendant, and inconsistent with any other possibil-ity. If the state and the defendant do not settle thecase with a plea agreement (i.e., an admission ofguilt from the defendant), the case is presented toeither a jury or a judge. Proving a case requirestestimony from witnesses and evidence. An equine veterinarian is essential at every step of the prosecutor's case to help prove animal cruelty. 3. The Importance of a Good Report An important aspect of the prosecutor's chargingdecision is the medical report received from anequine veterinarian. The report aids a prosecutorin determining whether the acts were intentional ordue to a disease, the level of penalty based on thetype of harm (e.g., whether it's great, substantial, orsomething less), and the strength of the case basedon the ndings in the report. The completeness ofthe report also helps the prosecutor determine thestrength of the equine veterinarian as a witness.For instance, a complete and thorough report indi-cates that the veterinarian will be a methodical andknowledgeable witness. It is also benecial if theequine veterinarian familiarizes himself/herselfwith the local animal cruelty laws and levels of harmso that a report may be written to address the levelof harm. If the equine veterinarian's ndings, opinions, conclusions, results, or other materials are used asevidence in a criminal trial, he/she must testify. Simply submitting a report into evidence withouttestimony violates the defendant's right to confron-tation and has been repeatedly held impermissibleby the United States Supreme Court and statecourts. bIn other words, if an equine veterinarian provides any sort of expertise during an animal cru- elty investigation, he/she can expect to be called tothe witness stand if a case proceeds to trial. Therare exception is if an equine veterinarian is hired asa consulting expert during case preparation simplyto help the state prepare its case, and is providing notestimony or evidence. c If an equine veterinarian prepares a report as part of the investigation or testies for the state in a trial,the state must provide the defense \"a written sum-mary of the subject matter of the expert's testimony,along with any ndings, opinions, or conclusions theexpert will give, the basis for them, and the expert'squalications.\" 10The state must also provide the defense with reports of examinations, experiments, and scientic tests.11Likewise, if the defense hires an expert, they must disclose the same materials to the state.12The disclosure requirements gives each side time to study the opposing expert's mate- rials, prepare for cross examination, and nd weak-nesses in the expert's results. The disclosure requirement also highlights the necessity for a good report. Whether a case goes totrial is based on a calculation of risk, especially bythe defense. For instance, a defense attorney orhis/her consulting expert will review an equine vet-erinarian's report from the state prior to determin-ing whether to go to trial. If they nd that thereport is thorough, reasonable, and objective, theymay conclude that trial is too risky and convincetheir client to plead guilty based upon the strengthof that report and the state's expert. If they ndthat the report is biased, unprofessional, lacking indetail, or failing to dispose of alternative theories,they may nd trial an acceptable risk given thenumerous holes that can be exploited in that report.In other words, spending the time to write a clear,professional, objective, and thorough report willlessen the chance that an equine veterinarian willhave to spend a considerable amount of time testi-fying and preparing for court. 4. The Equine Veterinarian as an Expert Witness If a case clears all the legal hurdles and is not settledwith a plea agreement, the matter is tried before ajury or a judge (both are called the \"trier of fact\").The prosecutor has the burden to present evidenceand witnesses to the trier of fact, and prove the casebeyond a reasonable doubt. In an equine crueltycase, a prosecutor will typically call law enforcementofcers, humane agents, representatives of rescueorganizations, and lay witnesses. The most impor-tant witness a prosecutor will call is the equineveterinarian. A veterinarian is a strong witnessbecause he/she can be qualied as an expert wit- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 209EMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BADness\u2014a status that gives the veterinarian morepower and leeway than what is afforded to a laywitness. 5. Legal Basics of Expert Testimony Rule 702 of the Minnesota Rules of Evidence is thegateway rule that permits expert testimony in cer-tain circumstances (the rule is similar to rules usedin other jurisdictions). The rule states: \"If scientic, technical, or other specialized knowl- edge will assist the trier of fact to understand theevidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witnessqualied as an expert by knowledge, skill, experi-ence, training, or education, may testify thereto inthe form of an opinion or otherwise. The opinionmust have foundational reliability. In addition, ifthe opinion or evidence involves novel scientic the-ory, the proponent must establish that the underly-ing scientic evidence is generally accepted in therelevant scientic community.\" The rule is broadly phrased to include any area of specialized knowledge, whether it was gainedthrough formal training, skill, or experience. 13\"The rule also contemplates expert testimony in the form of lecture or explanation.\"13\"The expert may edu - cate the jury so the jurors can draw their own infer-ence or conclusion from the evidence presented.\" 13 When compared with lay witnesses, expert wit- nesses have more flexibility in the courtroom. Laywitnesses are typically prohibited from offeringopinions, or may only offer opinions in limited cir-cumstances. 14Expert witnesses may offer an opin - ion on the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier offact. d15Lay witnesses are typically prohibited from \"lecturing\" or offering broad explanations.e Expert witnesses also bring authority. Therefore,given the additional powers of an expert witness, athreshold must be met before they are allowed totestify. 6. Threshold for Expert Testimony Before an equine veterinarian's expert testimony isallowed in a trial, the judge must make three pre-liminary determinations: 1. Is the subject matter of the testimony outside the realm of common knowledge so that ex-pert testimony can assist the trier of fact inreaching its decisions? 2. Does the expert, by way of education or ex- perience, possess sufcient expertise or spe-cialized knowledge so that opinions on thissubject matter can assist the trier of fact? 3. Is the foundation for the opinion sound so that the opinion can assist the trier of fact? 16 Assisting the Trier of Fact Judges will allow an equine veterinarian's testi-mony when it assists the trier of fact. f17According to the Minnesota Supreme Court, \"A reasonable test to be applied is whether the members of the jury,having the knowledge and general experience com- mon to every member of the community would beaided in the consideration of the issues by the of-fered testimony.\" 18The court also noted that, \"We think... that such evidence should be received only where the subject matter is complicated or its oper-ation difcult and embracing matters either in con-struction or operation not of common knowledge.\" 19 In other words, if the testimony relates to matters ofcommon knowledge, it will be of no use to a jury. g Expert testimony from an equine veterinarian will typically meet this threshold, especially in animalcruelty cases. h20Equine veterinarians have the medical training to describe to a jury how an act, omission, or neglect affected a particular animal, orproduced unjustiable pain, suffering, or death.Such matters are outside the scope of commonknowledge, especially considering that animals can-not verbally describe the act, omission, or neglect,nor its effect. Expert testimony in animal cruelty cases is also helpful with other aspects of proving the crime.For instance, the state has to prove that the act ofcruelty was intentional. An equine veterinarianmay distinguish between intentional acts and acci-dental acts. 21An expert may also link injuries to a weapon or suspect, or offer an opinion on how acts could have reasonably been prevented.21 Qualications of an Expert Before an attorney can obtain expert opinions froman equine veterinarian, he/she must elicit evidenceor statements from the expert to distinguish theexpert from a lay witness. Although education,training, and knowledge are factors, courts haveoften viewed practical experience as the most impor-tant qualication. i22The determination is whether the witness' \"knowledge of the matter in relation to which his opinion is sought is such that it will prob-ably aid the trier of the question to determine thetruth.\" 23 Sometimes, the lawyers are able to stipulate that a witness is qualied as an expert. In most cases,however, the proponent of the expert has to lay afoundation with testimony from the witness. Ingeneral, an equine veterinarian called as an expertwitness should be able to discuss his/her education,licensure requirements, occupation, past employ-ment, duties and responsibilities, internships, num-ber of similar cases, membership and leadership inprofessional organizations, professional lectures and presentations, professional publications, andawards and recognitions. A good practice point isfor a witness to explain the minimum qualicationsin his/her eld, and then explain how he/she exceedsthose qualications. 24 Foundation for the Expert Opinion The facts or data establishing an expert opinionmust be sufcient for an adequate foundation. 25 This determination is subject to a two part test: 210 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BAD\"1. are these facts and data of a type relied upon byexperts in this eld when forming inferences or opin-ions on the subject; 2. is this reliance reasonable?\" 26 These requirements provide \"a check on the trust-worthiness of the opinion and its foundation.\" j26 Basically, the judge has to be satised that thefacts or data the expert is using as the basis ofhis/her opinion is trustworthy and helps guaran-tee the validity of the opinion. 26An expert may rely on facts or data that is inadmissible in evi-dence, such as hearsay, \"including conversationswith other expert witnesses, professional litera-ture, personal observations, or lectures.\" 26k With regard to reliability of the opinion with med- ical experts, Minnesota courts are flexible and deferto the expertise of the expert. 26The Minnesota Supreme Court has noted that \"It is not necessary that medical opinion be capable of demonstration orthat an expert speak with condence excluding alldoubt; it is enough that he state his opinion as truein his judgment.\" 27 When the proponent establishes the basis for an equine veterinarian as an expert, that expert shouldbe able to explain the facts and data underlying theopinion, and describe how it is customary to relyupon those facts and data in the eld. For exam-ple, an equine veterinarian should be able to ex-plain how he/she would typically examine anequine, how the examination relies on the ndingsof other individuals such as laboratory techni-cians, and the reasonableness of relying on per-sonal observations, education, experience andscientic literature.7. How to Be an Effective Witness In Court Understanding Your Audience: The Jury In jury trials, the trier of fact is the jury. An effec- tive expert witness understands the science behindjury decision making and can tailor his/her commu-nication style to the jury. Prior to the start of trial, the parties undergo jury selection. In Minnesota, jurors are chosen from alist of registered voters and licensed drivers. 28 Jury selection is conducted via a process of elimina-tion from the jury pool. For instance, each side isgiven a number of preemptory strikes, l29and the court may strike an unlimited number of prospective jurors for cause.m30Lawyers on each side have an idea of the type of juror they want, and can guess the type of juror the other side wants. For instance,prosecutors will use preemptory strikes to removejurors favorable to the defense, and the defense willuse preemptory strikes to remove jurors favorable tothe state. The panel left after the strikes oftenrepresents a typical cross section of the population. Decades of social science and jury research \"has shown that most people are affective, not cognitive,thinkers.\" 31\"Most people are emotional, symbol-ori - ented, selective perceivers of information who basetheir decisions largely on previously held attitudesabout people and events.\" 31The typical person is also a deductive reasoner\u2014using only a few prem- ises to arrive at a decision, and then accepting, re-jecting, or distorting \"other information to t their already determined conclusions.\" 31In contrast, a scientic expert witness is a cognitive thinker\u2014bas- ing decisions on evaluation, synthesis, and analysis.Given a jury panel with a typical cross section of thepopulation who will most like be affective thinkers,veterinarians who are typically cognitive thinkersneed to understand how to bridge that chasm be-tween affective thinkers and cognitive thinkers. A way to bridge that chasm is for the equine veterinarian to think of themselves as a teacher. n31 Consider ways to take complicated testimony andmake it simple and interesting for the students (thejurors). 31A good exercise is for the expert witness to think back on his/her best teachers, and what qualities made them good teachers.31Consider the ways in which those teachers made learning fun and understandable, and translate them into the testi-mony. 31Equine veterinarians should also employ different ways to get across the testimony, including visual aids.31Expert witnesses should delve into the natural enthusiasm and passion they have for their subjects. This is an equine veterinarian'schance to discuss and share an area that they loveand have spent years mastering. That enthusiasmwill be noticed and appreciated by jurors, and makethe expert likeable (likeability reaches the core of anaffective thinker). Additional complications include a juror's precon- ceived notions about an expert. When a jury hearsthe terms \"expert witness\" or \"equine veterinarian,\"Table 1.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 211EMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BADthey may expect complicated and confusing testi-mony, or a boring lecture. 31They may also have questions about whether the expert is truly an ex- pert; a belief that the expert is biased; or a notionthat the expert is a condescending intellectual. 31 An expert can counter these expectations by usingclear, non-technical language; using visual aids; giv-ing a thorough explanation of experience and edu-cation (e.g., an expert should discuss what sets him/her apart from others in the eld); demonstratingfairness and objectivity; and showing that he/she isa normal person who is there to help the jury with adecision. 31 8. General Tips on Being an Effective and Prepared Expert Witness There are a number of ways an equine veterinariancan be a prepared and an effective expert witness.First, the expert should always meet with the law-yer who chose him/her as the expert before givingany testimony. Of the tips discussed, this is themost important. This gives the expert a chance toexplain to the lawyer his/her testimony, practicedirect examination, discuss the order of what will becovered, and what exhibits will be introduced. Ex-pert testimony is typically organized as follows:1) introduction, 2) education and experience, 3) opin-ions, and 4) basis for the opinions. 31Meeting with the lawyer ahead of time will also give the expert a chance to put together testimony in a meaningfulway, and prepare for cross examination by the op-posing party. A meeting prior to court also helpsthe lawyer and the expert to come to a \"meeting ofthe minds\" with the proposed testimony and themanner in which the testimony will be used. Second, an equine veterinarian should visit the courtroom when it is empty to familiarize himself/herself with the layout of the witness stand, thelocation of the jury box, and the location of theattorneys. oAn expert who knows the layout of the room beforehand can enter the courtroom with condence. Third, an equine veterinarian should listen to the questions, but speak to the jury. An equine veter-inarian should think about the testimony as a con-versation with the jury. The expert should look atthe jury when answering, and be polite and friendlywith responses to questions. Fourth, prior to trial, an equine veterinarian should provide the attorney with everything he/shehas published, a re \u00b4sume \u00b4 or CV, and transcripts of any previous expert testimony in other trials, ifavailable. Fifth, the equine veterinarian should bring all documents and notes related to the expert opinion inthe case. It is permissible for an expert to refer tothese documents and notes while testifying if theexpert cannot recall something during their testi-mony (the best practice is to ask the attorney if it ispermissible to refer to the notes before answering inorder to refresh recollection). Sixth, an equine veterinarian should be condent in his/her testimony, but he/she should never makeup an answer. It is permissible to admit when theexpert does not know the answer to a question. 9. How to Handle Cross Examination An expert should prepare for cross examination.The opposing attorney will typically attack an ex-pert's bias, the basis of the opinion, and lack of orreasonableness of alternative explanations. pCross examination from an opposing party is meant to destroy the credibility of the expert witness, reducethe expert's likeability, or bolster the narrative oftheir case. For instance, a defense attorney in ananimal cruelty case will often argue disease as adefense, not negligence of care; they may attempt toget the equine veterinarian for the state to admitthat disease could have been a factor in order tobolster their theory of the case. The expert should ask the prosecutor beforehand about the anticipated defenses that will be raised bythe opposing party so that he/she can prepare forcross examination. The best way to prepare is toobtain a copy of the materials that the prosecutorreceived from the defense through the disclosureprocess. If the defense intends to question the ex-pert using other scientic sources, those sourceshave to be disclosed, which gives the expert a chanceto prepare. For example, a common technique is toattack the basis of the expert's underlying opinionby using an alternative explanation found in a sci-entic treatise. Having a copy of this treatise be-forehand will give the expert time to formulate aresponse and be prepared for questions concerningthat treatise during cross examination. Another common cross-examination technique is for the attorney to \"box in the expert\" by gainingonly \"yes\" or \"no\" answers without clarifying ex-planations. The expert should remember that theTable 2. Difference Between Direct and Cross ExaminationDirect Examination Cross Examination Open-ended questions Leading questions (a question that suggests the answer) Example: \"Based upon the examination, what were your conclusions?\"Example: \"Your opinion is that the animal died from a combination of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation?\" Questioning by the lawyer who called the expert Questioning by the lawyer attacking the expertLeading questions are generally prohibited Open-ended questions are generally discouraged 212 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BADattorney offering the expert gets redirect (i.e., ad-ditional open-ended questioning after cross exam-ination), and will allow an expert to clarify orexpound on answers that were elicited duringcross examination. Overall, the equine veterinarian must maintain condence in his/her expert opinion. If the equineveterinarian is condent, then the trier of fact willbe condent in relying upon that opinion in makinga decision; otherwise, the trier of fact may ignore thesubstance of the entire testimony. Many cross-ex-amining attorneys will try to shake the expert's con-dence by getting the expert angry or flustered.An agitated witness appears confused, biased, or notforthcoming. This technique is also intended tomake the witness defensive and argumentative,which reduces likeability. The best way to combatthis technique is to remain calm and exceedinglypolite; this will make the cross-examining lawyerlook like a bully (which reduces the lawyer'slikeability). 10. Conclusion The equine veterinarian is often the most vital wit-ness in an animal cruelty case. Understanding thebasics of the veterinarian's role before and duringthe prosecution of an animal cruelty case will givethe equine veterinarian a deeper understanding oflegal procedures and condence in the courtroom.

Introduction 10 years, the number of equine rescuefacilities in the United States has rapidly in-creased. These rescues range from structured,tax-exempt organizations governed by a Board ofDirectors (BOD) to private rescues run by an in-dividual or family. Most rescuers start out withgood intentions: to help needy horses. Unfortu-nately, some rescuers do not utilize best practicesfor rescue and equine care, and they end up be-coming part of the problem. Their horses areseized due to neglect, causing the horses unneces-sary suffering and costing communities additionalmonies in investigations and court expenses. In the past few years, authorities in multiple states have seized emaciated horses from rescueorganizations and individuals who claim to haverescued the horses. The horses in these caseshave suffered from a lack of food and water andinsufcient veterinary care. In most cases,horses came from bad situations and simply werenot given an opportunity to regain lost weight ornd veterinary care, although in some cases horses actually lost weight while with the rescueorganization. Equine rescues can fail in their mission due for many reasons, but the primary reasons are poor un-derstanding of nonprot structure and management,lack of knowledge of equine care, insufcient funding,over commitment, and the inability to turn a needyhorse away. Although the American Association of Equine Practitioners, the Animal Welfare Institute and Hu-mane Society of the United States, the University ofCalifornia-Davis, and several other organizationshave published guidelines for horse rescues, mostrescue organizations are not aware of these stan-dards and thus do not follow them. Veterinarians can help alleviate the suffering in- advertently caused by well-meaning rescuers byworking with these organizations to insure theyfollow good equine husbandry and nonprot man-agement guidelines. When local rescues become problem rescues, veterinarians can work with local AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 215EMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BAD NOTESlaw enforcement; other veterinarians; and stable, sus-tainable rescue organizations to assist the horses. 2. Identifying Good Rescues Good rescue organizations provide critical servicesto the horse industry and to their communities.They often take in horses no one else wants, theyrehabilitate horses from neglect cases, they tameand train wild/unhandled horses, and they retrainabused horses and those with behavioral problems.They save local communities funds by helping lawenforcement agencies to investigate neglect cases,educate owners about proper horse care to reduceneglect due to ignorance, and provide manpower andfacilities for housing horses when seizures arenecessary. There is a great deal of variation in the size, mission, and structure of rescue organizations.Some house all of their horses at one or two facilitieswhereas other organizations house their horses atfoster homes. Some organizations take in only afew horses each year whereas others take in over ahundred horses per year. Some rescue organiza-tions have paid staff and others are completely vol-unteer run. Rescues may focus on a particularbreed or type of horse, a particular source of horses(neglect cases, auction purchases, owner surrenders,etc.), or horses with specic needs (horses with be-havioral problems, those with medical needs, etc.). Rescues may be set up as a 501(c)(3), tax-exempt organization. To achieve 501(c)(3) status, the res-cue must have a BOD, be incorporated in the state itoperates in, and submit paperwork and a fee to theInternal Revenue Service (IRS). The rescue mustsubmit annual reports to the IRS to maintain itsstatus, and nancial records of the organizationmust be open to the public. Donations made to501(c)(3) organizations are tax-deductible. Some rescuers decide to forego the 501(c)(3) status and instead operate as private rescues. They donot have to incorporate or submit reports to the IRS,and they do not have to maintain open books. Do-nations made to these rescues are not tax deduct-ible, but the individuals running the rescue may berequired to report income from the rescue (such asdonations, adoption fees, proceeds from fundraisers,etc.) as personal income and pay taxes on it. Regardless of the specic structure or mission, good rescue organizations share several traits. Transparency Good rescue organizations are transparent withtheir foundational documents. This includes theirIRS Determination letter (which grants them501(c)(3) status), annual form 990 (nancial reportto the IRS), bylaws, and articles of incorporation.They also have published policies that govern thedetails of how their organization operates: adop-tions, foster home management, veterinary care, etc. Although many rescues do not publish their phys- ical location because they do not want drop-in visi-tors or horses abandoned at their gates, they do have accessible email addresses and phone numbers.They return calls and emails in a timely manner,although it may take a few days to return calls andemails given that many are operated by volunteers.Everyone should avoid rescues that do not returncalls or emails in a timely fashion. Good rescues also are transparent about the horses in their care. They provide the public withthe number of horses that enter their program eachyear, are adopted out, are returned by adopters, andthat died or were euthanized. They also provideinformation on where their horses come from (neg-ligent owners, animal control transfers, owner sur-renders, etc.). Veterinary records are available forpotential adopters, and they are willing to discloseany health or behavior problems. Good Husbandry All horses at reputable rescues receive vaccinationsrecommended for their area, an annual Coggins test,annual dental care, routine de-worming, and routinefarrier care. Exceptions can be made for horsesthat are too frightened or wild to treat. However,the rescue should have experienced handlers work-ing with these horses to help them achieve a level oftraining that is safe for them and their handlers. Illnesses and lameness should be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Good rescues are will-ing to have horses euthanized who cannot recoverfrom illness or lameness on the advice of a veteri-narian. Ideally, the organization will have a policythat governs the decision making on treatmentand/or euthanasia. That policy should set the stagefor managers of the organization to make pragmaticand humane decisions in these situations. Good rescues provide hay, grain, and water of sufcient quality and quantity to help healthyhorses maintain their weight and to help emaciatedhorses safely gain weight. They provide feed andfeeding regimens tailored to each equine's uniqueneeds. Good rescues may have skinny and ill horses at their facilities, and they may also have horses thatare difcult to handle. They should be able to doc-ument how long the horse has been with the rescueand show that the horse is improving. They shouldhave and follow a plan for physical rehabilitationand training for each horse in the rescue. The facilities do not need to be state of the art, but reputable rescues have clean facilities with suf-cient space for each equine. Fences are in goodrepair, and there is plenty of appropriate shelteravailable. The facilities are designed to avoid inju-ries to horses and to keep handlers and visitors safe. Fiscal Responsibility Running a rescue takes money, and responsible res-cues have sound, sustainable nances. They main-tain an annual budget and adjust the budget eachyear as needed. They receive funds from a variety 216 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BADof sources, and they work hard to keep their ex-penses low while at the same time providing qualitycare to their equines. Well-run rescues have savings to cover emergen- cies, and they are not constantly in crisis: threat-ening to close down or unable to feed the horsesbecause of a lack of funds. They strive to expandtheir donor base, and they thank donors promptly. Financial responsibility is not left in the hands of just one or two people: good rescues employ checksand balances to make sure money is being spentappropriately. The BOD should review and ap-prove the annual budget. The person responsiblefor making deposits should be separate from theperson responsible for writing checks. Someoneother than the treasurer should review the nancialrecords on a routine basis. More than one personshould be on all bank accounts. For rescues with paid staff, the salaries should be appropriate for the responsibilities and the location,but exorbitant salaries are a sign of problems. Sound Adoption Policies Unless the organization is a sanctuary where horsesgo to live out the remainder of their lives, one goal ofreputable rescue organizations is to make goodadoption matches. Before an organization puts ahorse up for adoption, they make sure the horse'sveterinary and farrier care are current and that thehorse's training level is assessed. Good rescues dis-close any known health, lameness, or behavioralproblems. Good rescues are willing to take an ad-opted horse back if it does not work out for itsadopter or if the adopter cannot keep his horse re-gardless of how long ago the horse was adopted.They also adopt horses out with no breeding con-tracts and follow up to insure that horses are work-ing out in their new homes. Good rescues requireadopters to sign an adoption contract, and they en-force their contracts fairly for all adopters. Willingness to Learn and Improve Good rescues know that they can always improvetheir operation, so they are willing to learn. Theyattend animal welfare conferences when availableand seek education from reputable equine maga-zines, their farriers, and their veterinarians. Theywork with respected trainers and clinicians and seektraining for their volunteers and foster homes. Good Reputation Finally, good rescues have a good reputation withothers in their area. Veterinarians, farriers, lawenforcement, animal control ofcers, feed store own-ers, and trainers know who they are. Their adopt-ers and volunteers are happy, and they have repeatadopters and long-term volunteers. There is al-ways some volunteer turnover in rescue as volun-teers move, get busy with jobs or families, or loseinterest in horses or rescue. However, excessivevolunteer turnover is a sign of internal problems in the organization. The leader of good rescues is qualied to run the organization. He or she is well-educated on equinecare and training, and he or she seeks qualiedadvisories in areas of nonprot management. Theleader should have a good reputation with the vol-unteers of the organization and the public. Commitment to Donors, Volunteers, and Horses Good rescue organizations honor their commitmentto their donors by using donated funds wisely.They compare prices on items and services to get thebest price. They seek discounted or donated ser-vices when possible. When donors designate a giftbe used for a specic purpose, it is. Good rescue organizations honor their commit- ment to their volunteers. They make sure the workenvironment is safe and appropriate. They providetraining or mentoring to volunteers, and they arewilling to move volunteers to different jobs to helpthem nd the best t. They listen to volunteersand make adjustments to volunteer schedules andtasks as possible. Good rescue organizations honor their commit- ment to their horses by making their care a priority.They follow reasonable standards of care and pro-vide safe housing. They work with veterinarians todiagnose and treat illnesses, injuries, and lameness.If a horse is suffering and his pain cannot be rea-sonably relieved, they authorize their veterinarianto euthanize the horse. 3. Working With Existing Rescues Veterinarians can help good rescues become evenbetter organizations in several ways. One way is toprovide discounted veterinary services when possi-ble. No organization should expect or demand freeor discounted veterinary services, but they appreci-ate veterinarians who offer discounts, even if only onoccasion. Rescues have a responsibility to their do-nors to use donated money wisely and they have aresponsibility to the horses at their facility now andthose that need them in the future. Veterinarianswho can help rescues through discounted or donatedveterinary services help donations go further, en-abling more horses to receive the help they need. Some veterinarians offer a discount on their ser- vices to rescues they work with, and others set up avaccination clinic where they offer free or heavilydiscounted vaccinations for the rescue horses 1 dayper year. Veterinarians may also recommend thatrescues they work with apply to receive vaccinationsfor their horses from the Unwanted Veterinary Re-lief Campaign. Providing veterinary services is just one way vet- erinarians can work with rescues. They can alsowork with rescues that provide law enforcement as-sistance, serve on the BOD, serve on an advisoryboard, or work with rescues to educate the public onproper horse care. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 217EMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BADWhen working with rescue organizations that as- sist law enforcement in seizing horses, the veteri-narian may provide an expert opinion on whether aseizure is warranted based on the condition of thehorse(s), may attend the seizure to assess and treathorses on site, and/or may assess the horses oncethey've been moved to a holding facility awaitingcourt. Expert witness testimony provided by veter-inarians can be critical to a successful court case. Given that good rescues are always willing to learn and improve, veterinarians can educate res-cues about best practices in equine care. This mayinclude offering suggestions on revisions to policy onstandards of care, veterinary care, euthanasia, etc.as well as sharing information about the latest re-search in diseases, lameness, and refeeding. For veterinarians who would like to get more in- volved in a rescue operation, there are two options:serving on the BOD or the advisory board. TheBOD is the legally and scally responsible gover-nance of the organization. It sets the policies andinsures that staff (employees and volunteers) adhereto those polices. It hires or appoints the ExecutiveDirector, and it insures that the organization workstoward its mission. The BOD is responsible formaking sure the rescue has the funds needed tooperate through setting a reasonable budget, partic-ipating in fundraising activities, and making an an-nual contribution to the organization. By servingon a rescue's BOD, veterinarians can help deviseand implement best practices for rescues and over-see the care the rescue's horses receive. BOD members have a responsibility to put the organization rst in all transactions and to discloseany conflicts of interests to the organization. Be-cause serving on the BOD carries legal responsibil-ities, anyone considering serving on a rescue's BODshould make sure the organization carries directorsand ofcers' insurance. The advisory board is a less-formal group of indi- viduals who offer advice to the organization. Theydo not have the ability to make decisions about thegovernance of the organization, but they share theirexpertise with the BOD and Executive Director andmay help establish or run programs for the organi-zation. In general, serving on an advisory board isa less-formal and time-consuming option than serv-ing on the BOD. Veterinarians can work with rescue organizations to educate the public and help horses in their localcommunities. There are several ways to make thishappen. Veterinarians can present information onproper horse care to the public at a rescue event.Veterinarians may donate or discount their time toput on low-cost vaccination and/or Coggins clinics.Rescues and veterinarians can partner to distributeinformation on good horse care at events in theirarea. Veterinarians who would like to nancially con- tribute to a rescue organization can do so with cashdonations, gift certicates, or items for silent auc-tions, or by making a donation in the memory of a client's horse. 4. Preparing a Safety Net One of the best things a veterinarian can do to helpprepare a safety net is to know the rescues in his/herarea. They can look for local rescues online and askclients, veterinarians, and other horse professionalsfor lists of local rescues and about individuals whofoster for rescue organizations. Unless anotherveterinarian knows and has visited the rescuelately, the veterinarian should review the rescue'swebsite, talk to the rescue's manager or executivedirector, and visit the rescue. He or she shouldcheck to see that the rescue adheres to the practicesof good rescues (discussed above), and offer to helpunderperforming rescues improve their operationthrough educational opportunities. Getting to know the law enforcement or animal control ofcers responsible for equine cases in thearea is another important step in preparing a safetynet. Veterinarians can offer to assist ofcers with neglect or abuse investigations at rescue facilities.When rescuers are not providing proper care to thehorses at their facility, veterinarians can work withofcers to educate rescuers so that they can providebetter care for the horses at their facility. If therescuer is unable or unwilling to provide propercare, veterinarians can assist law enforcement inseizing horses if necessary. When a veterinarian discovers a rescue that is not caring for its horses and is unwilling to makenecessary changes, he or she needs to report therescue to local law enforcement. Sometimes vet-erinarians are reluctant to do this because theyfear repercussions or loss of business from existingclients. However, these poorly run rescues needto be reported as soon as they're discovered, beforethey have a chance to acquire, and neglect, morehorses. Veterinarians can work with other veterinarians, rescues, and horse industry members to form a res-cue coalition in their community. The coalition canserve several purposes. It allows the horse indus-try and veterinarians a chance to get to know andkeep in touch with local horse rescues, allowingthem to spot problems early on. The coalition canoffer educational opportunities to horse rescuers,allowing them to improve their operations. The co-alition can also work together to aid law enforce-ment agencies in large-scale rescues, when there aretoo many horses for any one agency or rescue tohandle. A local rescue coalition aids the rescues by offer- ing educational opportunities and a chance to gainpublic trust. It allows veterinarians to give back tothe horse industry and to protect horses in theircommunities. It can also serve to get the veterinar-ian's name in front of potential clients (the rescue'sadopters, foster homes, and volunteers). The coali- 218 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGING INDUSTRY ISSUES \u2014 WHEN A RESCUE GOES BADtion can save local communities money by aiding lawenforcement with neglect cases. 5. Conclusion Veterinarians can protect the health and welfare ofhorses living at rescue centers by identifying good res- cues in their area, working with those rescues toinsure that their horses receive proper care, andassisting law enforcement ofcers who receivecomplaints about rescue organizations. By doingthis, veterinarians can prevent equine suffering atthe hands of poorly run or overwhelmed rescue organizations.

Introduction One of the most often discussed topics in the area ofpractice management is how does one nance theacquisition of a veterinary practice. In general,there are two sources of nancing practice owner-ship. Internal nancing involves the seller of aninterest in a practice providing nancing. Externalnancing involves a buyer working with a sourceother than the seller to provide the nancing neces-sary to purchase an interest in a practice. Theseexternal sources can include nancial institutionssuch as banks or other external sources such asfamily members. Ultimately, any nancing source, whether exter- nal or internal, is going to use the cash flow from thepractice as a source for the repayment of the nanc-ing they provide. This means that before any -nancing can be provided a buyer must be able toclearly identify how much money the practice isproviding for its owners. Some practices strugglewith clearly identifying how much money is beingpaid to the current owners that could be used torepay debt if a transfer or ownership were to occur. 2. Internal Financing The internal nancing of the acquisition of a veter-inary practice typically involves the existing owneror owners selling a portion or all of their interest toexisting associate veterinarians. The buyer signs anote to the seller as part, if not all, the consideration for the acquisition of the interest in the practice.This process involves several aspects including thevaluation of the practice interest being acquired, theactual terms of the note the buyer is executing forthe benet of the seller, the readiness of the associ-ate to become an owner, and the seller being \"ready\"to sell an interest in the practice. Valuation is always a difcult subject but in an internally nanced practice acquisition it can be-come even more difcult. It is more difcult due tothe fact that there is no outside entity involved tohelp determine the value of the interest being trans-ferred. This situation potentially exaggerates thedifferences that a seller and buyer may have regard-ing the value of the interest being sold. The typicalseller in this situation may have founded the prac-tice or at a minimum has owned it for a very longtime and in all likelihood has become emotionallyattached to the ownership of the practice and there-fore may believe the practice is worth more than canbe justied using generally accepted valuationmethodology. Also, a seller may have not done anyadvance preparation and planning for a successionand therefore they may need to get more for the practice than it is worth in order to feel secure asthey move into a phase of life where they will not bemaking a regular income. A buyer may not feel asthough they can afford to purchase the practice be- 220 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: SUCCESSION PLANNING AS A BUSINESS STRATEGY NOTEScause of existing student debt or other nancialhardship. Sometimes potential buyers simply lacksufcient training and experience to take on theduties that come with ownership. Although most ofthese challenges have little or nothing to do with theactual value of the practice, it does have a very realeffect on the perception of the value of the practice.Without assistance from an outside advisor,whether it be a bank, accountant, or consultant, allof these potential challenges to internal nancingcan become amplied and potentially derail whatshould be a great succession opportunity. In an internally nanced practice transfer, one must determine the actual terms of the note. These termsinclude interest rate, length of the note or term, fre-quency of payments, and security or collateral secur-ing the note. In an externally nanced transaction,the nancial institution loaning the money to thebuyer has a very established criterion for all of thesefactors. In an internally nanced transaction it iseasy for the terms of the note to vary with other fac-tors. Most often, if a seller is getting the price theywant they may give the buyer something other thancommercially reasonable terms on the note. For in-stance, interest-free notes, or principal reductions forcertain performance criteria. These types of arrange-ments only serve to complicate the transaction andtypically lead to conflict down the road when the prac-tice may not be doing as well. If the appropriatevalue is used, then commercially reasonable termsshould be applied to the note and not present anynancial hardship to either party. Readiness of the seller and the buyer are equally important in an internally nanced transaction asan externally nanced transaction. In an inter-nally nanced transaction, however, a lack of read-iness on either parties' part may not be discovereduntil both parties are fully invested in the processand this might make it more difcult to terminate apotential transaction. Whereas, in an externallynanced transaction there are more outside individ-uals involved that may be able to assess the readi-ness of the buyer and seller at an earlier stage in thetransaction. On the surface, internally nanced practice ac- quisition seems to be easier and less expensive butmay, in the end, prove to be more complicated,more expensive, and more difcult to actually ac-complish. Should one want to entertain an inter-nally nanced transaction they should spend timeand resources making sure the practice is fairlyvalued and the terms of the transaction are com-mercially reasonable. 3. External Financing An externally nanced practice ownership transac-tion involves the seller, buyer, and a nancingsource other than the seller. Typically, this thirdparty is a nancial institution such as a bank orcredit union. Sometimes, however, this third partymay be a friend or relative of the buyer. When anexternal source other than a nancial institution is used, the transaction tends to take on more of thecharacteristics of an internally nanced transactionbecause both parties tend to become less objectiveand there is not outside \"voice of reason\" involved inthe transaction. Generally speaking, nancial institutions are willing to loan money for practice acquisitionswhen the potential transaction meets their crite-ria. These criteria vary by institution but gener-ally include some type of valuation criteria, termsof the note, security for the note, and credit wor-thiness of the buyer. Most nancial institutionswant the after-tax cash flow of the business to beable to fund all of the future payments of the notewithin the given term of the note. The note termis typically 10 years or less and the typical noteinterest rate is stated as a certain number ofpoints over the institution's prime rate, dependingon the credit worthiness of the buyer/borrower. It is always prudent when working with a nan- cial institution to explore your nancial options withmore than one institution. Typically, the big \"na-tional banks\" will have an established criterion fornancing practice ownership transactions. In fact,many of the big national banks and the big regionalbanks will have loan ofcers and departmentswithin the bank that specialize in veterinary lend-ing. Typically, the terms offered by the nationaland big regional banks seem to be better for thebuyer/borrower than terms presented to the buyer/borrower from local nancial institutions. Manytimes, however, if presented with the big bank termsheet, the local bank will meet or exceed the termsoffered by the big bank. For this reason, it is al-ways a good idea to explore nancing with multiplenancial institutions and have at least one big bankand one local bank involved in the process. 4. Financing and Cash Flow Are Connected As you have read throughout this document, valua-tion is a key aspect to nancing any practice owner-ship transaction. Whether nanced internally orexternally, the principal and interest of the note willbe funded with prots distributed to the owners ofthe practice. Ultimately, cash flow determines howmuch any business is worth, including veterinarypractices. Prior to becoming an owner of a practice, a non- owning veterinarian working in the practice is sim-ply paid for his efforts in the practice. Thiscompensation of efforts can be stated as a percent-age of that veterinarian's production or a set salary.Recently there has been a trend away from a com-mission like, percentage of production compensationto a more xed or flat salary. Even when one'scompensation for his efforts is xed, it is still re-lated, albeit less directly, to his production. A vet-erinarian who grosses $500,000 per year is probablygoing to be paid more, even if it is a flat amount,than a veterinarian who grosses $200,000 per year. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 221THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: SUCCESSION PLANNING AS A BUSINESS STRATEGYWhen one becomes an owner of a practice he is entitled to receive all of the excess cash flow createdby that practice. This excess cash flow is typicallyless than the mere prots of the business becauseprots do not account for things such as debt prin-cipal repayment within the practice, or acquisitionof additional equipment, real estate, or other capitalexpenditures. It is true that the owner gets paidlast and if the ownership are not good managersthere may not be much cash left over to distribute tothem. An equine practice should be able to gener-ate at least 10% of its gross revenue as cash flowdistributable to the owners. A well-run, efcientpractice with not much debt should be able to gen-erate signicantly more than 10% of its gross reve-nue as cash flow to the owners. The very best-runpractices with little or no debt service could create inexcess of 20% of gross revenue as cash flow to theowners. If a practice is distributing less than 10%then you must look more closely as to why and makesure all the owners are \"on board' with the reasonsthe practice is not producing enough cash. Obvi-ously, the more cash you distribute to the owners,the more valuable the practice and the more debt apotential buyer/borrower can \"afford\" to service withthese cash flows.One cannot overemphasize the importance of cash flow to practice acquisition nance. Value andtherefore total nancing available are factors of cashflow. The more cash flow, the more value. Themore value, the more one can borrow to nance apractice acquisition. 5. Conclusion Financing the acquisition of a practice is challengingin and of itself. The more you know and prepareahead of time the smoother the process. When be-ginning the process, one should create a team ofcompetent, experienced advisors who will providethe unbiased truth about a potential opportunity.Being prepared and listening to your team will helpmake what could be a stressful time more enjoyableand satisfying.

Chalk, Jr, CPA, JD, CFP\u00ae, ChSNC Succession planning is the process of planning for the successful transfer of control/ownership fromone generation of owners to the next. Over two thirds of small businesses started in the UnitedStates never make it to the next generation of ownership. Of the one third that make the transitionfrom one generation to the next, another two thirds never make it to the third generation. All in all,less than 10% of all small businesses started make it to the third generation of owners. Successionplanning is the key to increasing the probability of successfully transferring the ownership of abusiness from one generation to the next. Succession planning involves preparation: the prepara-tion of the business, the preparation of the seller, and the preparation of the buyer. This paper willexplore the nuts and bolts of succession planning as seen through the perspective of the business,the buyer, and the seller. Author's address: Chalk, jachalk@chalkcullum.com. \u00a9 2016 AAEP. 1. Introduction Before the ownership of any business, including aveterinary practice, can be transferred the businessitself must be prepared and healthy in order for thetransition of ownership to be successful. Preparingthe business for succession involves making sure thebooks and records are clean and accurate, the em-ployees are competent and performing their respec-tive duties without excessive supervision or the needfor additional training, and the nances of the busi-ness are steady and strong. Accurate books and records help the seller under- stand what the business is worth and gives thebuyer comfort that they have a good understandingof what the business is actually worth. Accuratebooks should include cash and accrual nancialstatements that are prepared at least quarterly.The statements that should be prepared include anincome statement, balance sheet, and cash flowstatement. The books and records should be a clearand accurate description of the business. Personalexpenses of the owner that are contained in the books and records of the business should be clearlyreported so that the next owner can understandwhat the business looks like without the currentowner. The nancial statements should assist all parties with calculating the value of the business. Ownersare paid in two ways. Owners that work in thebusiness should be paid a fair wage for working inthe business. In addition to the owners' wages forworking in the business, a business owner shouldalso receive compensation for their ownership.This compensation is paid in the form of dividends or prot distributions. It is these distributions thatform the basis for determining the value of anybusiness. The more a business returns to its own-ers the more it is worth. Conversely, if a businessis not returning much to the owners then the valueof the business is minimal, unless there is someother reasonable basis upon which to base a deter-mination of value. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 223THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: SUCCESSION PLANNING AS A BUSINESS STRATEGY NOTES2. The Seller The seller must be prepared to sell their interestin the business. This preparation involves review-ing the seller's overall personal nancial conditionand determining whether a particular seller is pre-pared to sell. The seller must take into accountthat once they are no longer owners of the businessthey will no longer receive the benets the businesshas previously provided them. Benets such assalary and prot distributions are obvious but youmust look closely at other benets that the sellerwas receiving and make sure that the seller willhave enough resources to use to afford to no longerreceive anything from the business. Some sellers may prefer to sell smaller parts of the business over time and gradually pass the owner-ship to the next owners. During this transition, theseller may continue to manage the business and bethe majority owner until they are completely pre-pared to step of the business. At the point they arefully prepared, they may then complete the succes-sion and sell the remaining ownership in thebusiness. 3. The Buyer Buyers must be prepared to become an owner.Many times people working in a business may wantto invest in the business for which they work.However, investing in the business and owning abusiness are different. An owner is ultimatelyresponsible for every aspect of the business. Theydecide who to hire, re, how much to pay, how muchto charge, what equipment should be purchased, aswell as every other decision of the business. Aninvestor might simply choose to sell their interest ifthey are not happy with the management of thebusiness. Buyers in a succession plan must become owners and not merely investors. Before a buyer begins to acquire interest in a business they should begin to review the nancialstatements and gather information regarding thebusiness. In short, they should begin to act like anowner before they become an owner. There may beadditional education that the potential buyer shouldobtain so they are equipped to become an ownerwhen the time is right. Both the buyer and seller will want to have a clear understanding of the entire succession plan if thereis going to be a gradual succession. Typically, thebuyer will start out being a minority interest holder.In these situations, it is important that the buyerand seller enter into a shareholder's agreement thatcovers how all the owners will be treated in caseswhere one of the owners wants or needs to get outof the ownership. The clearer you can make thisagreement the less chance there is of misunder-standing down the road. 4. Conclusion Succession planning is a process that takes time anda signicant amount of planning. All the partiesinvolved must be prepared in order for the transitionof ownership to go smoothly.

Early recognition is important and many of the required treatments are routinelycarried by equine practitioners. Intravenous fluids, calcium, and dextrose can be combined andadministered to rapidly manage is a life-threatening potassium de-rangement that occurs in both adult horses andfoals. 1Immediate treatment must be started in the eld if the abnormality is severe. Research inother species suggests that some treatments recom-mended to treat hyperkalemia in horses may be lesseffective than previously believed. 1Equine practi- tioners should be aware of these new treatment al-gorithms that can be used for the management ofhyperkalemia in both the eld and hospital setting. There are two major physiologic causes for hyper- kalemia in horses: 1) failure of the renal system toremove potassium from the body, and 2) shifting ofpotassium from within the cells to the extracellularfluid. In adult horses, hyperkalemia can be causedby anuric renal failure, hyperkalemic periodic paral-ysis (HYPP), rupture of the urinary system (bladder,ureters, or urethra), massive cellular destruction (rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis). 1,2In foals, anuric renal failure and common causes; however, cellular lysis canalso be encountered. 3Hyperkalemia may be sus- pected based on the history of an underlying con-dition, the presence of clinical signs, or by laboratory conrmation. Measured potassiumconcentrations can be affected by storage or am-bient temperature and therefore unexpected re-sults should be conrmed. Clinical signs of hyperkalemia may be mild but typically include muscle weakness. 1Electrocardio- graphic changes may be observed when plasma po-tassium concentrations reach levels as low as 6.2mmol/L and include 1) tall or peaked T-waves, 2)flattened P-waves, 3) prolongation of the QRS com- plex, and 4) eventual asystole. 4Electrocardio- gram (ECG) changes are not always present withhyperkalemia and their absence should not beused to exclude the diagnosis. If hyperkalemia is suspected due to historical in- formation (HYPP status, history of renal failure),clinical signs, or laboratory conrmation, treatmentshould be started immediately. Some cases (i.e.,HYPP) can be resolved in the eld whereas othersmay benet from stabilization before transport to anintensive care unit. Even a small improvement inthe degree of hyperkalemia may be life saving.The objective of this article is to describe the treat- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 225INTERNAL MEDICINE NOTESment hyperkalemia and to highlightrecent changes that affect equine practice. 2. Materials and Methods The emergency treatments for hyperkalemia areoutlined below. Newer proposed changes to pre-vious standard treatment recommendations arenotated (*). Severe Hyperkalemia Greater than 7.0 mmol/L and/or associated clinicalsigns and ECG changes.Intravenous Calcium Borogluconate (23%)Administer at a dose of 0.5-1 mL/kg. The dosecan be diluted in a 5-L bag of isotonic crystalloidfluids and given over 30-60 minutes. Cardiacarrhythmias are possible if calcium is adminis-tered too quickly; however, more rapid rates maybe necessary in life-threatening situations. Cal-cium administration will not signicantly changethe plasma potassium concentration but is used tomitigate the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia. 5 The treatments for moderate hyperkalemia listed below should also be initiated for cases of severehyperkalemia. Moderate Hyperkalemia Greater than 5.5 mmol/L and/or associated clinicalsigns and ECG changes.Isotonic Fluid Diuresis*Previous recommendations focused on the use ofisotonic (0.9%) saline that did not contain any po-tassium. However, research suggests the acidify-ing effects of 0.9% saline can induce shifting ofpotassium from the intracellular to extracellularfluid space. 6This shifting of potassium may be more detrimental than a less-acidifying fluidathat contains a moderate amount of potassium (5 meq/L). Administration of a commercially available acetatefluid at 4-6 mL/kg per hour can help induce a fluiddiuresis and potassium excretion from thekidneys. Intravenous Dextrose Administration Intravenous dextrose can be administered at rates as high as 8-16 mg/kg per minute in emergencysituations. 5A practical approach may be to add a 500-mL bottle of 50% dextrose to a 5-L bag of IVfluids that is administered over approximately 1hour for an average 500-kg horse. More moderaterates of dextrose administration (1-2 mg/kg/min)may be appropriate for milder effects associatedwith hyperkalemia by inducing the releaseof endogenous insulin and causing a shift of potas-sium from the extracellular- to intracellular-fluidspace.Intravenous Insulin Administration Regular insulin (100 units/mL) can be administered at 0.1-0.2 IU/kg per hour if used in conjunction withhigh rates of dextrose administration. In conjunc-tion with the practical approach described above, 0.5mL of regular insulin can be added to the same 5-Lbag of isotonic crystalloid fluid containing 500 mL of50% dextrose. This bag of fluids is administeredover approximately 1 hour for an average 500-kghorse. As mentioned previously, insulin will help to move potassium from the extracellular-fluid space into the intracellular-fluid space. 7 The author does not recommend the use of insulinin situations in which blood glucose cannot bemonitored. The consequences of severe hypogly-cemia are signicant and can be more life threat-ening than the hyperkalemia. Beta-Agonists* The administration of beta-agonists (inhaled or IV)have been shown to decrease potassium concentra-tions in other species. 8,9Research is needed in horses, but it is likely that a similar response would be observed. Inhaled albuterol (180-900 /H9262g) can be administered to horses for respiratory distressand may be a similar starting point for hyperkale-mia. This medication can be administered rapidlyand may be life saving when there will be a delaybefore starting other treatments. Similar to insu-lin, beta-agonists improve hyperkalemia by movingpotassium from the extracellular- to intracellular-fluid space. Furosemide Once IV fluid administration has been started, furo-semide administration (1 mg/kg) may help to im-prove potassium excretion from the kidneys.However, furosemide should not be administered tohorses with dehydration until adequate volume res-toration has occurred. In addition, furosemideshould be used carefully in cases of renal failurebecause it could lead to further deterioration in re-nal function. Continuous rate infusion of furo-semide may be a consideration if the medication isbeing used in a hospital setting. 10 Sodium Bicarbonate* Previous recommendations have advocated theearly use of sodium bicarbonate to treat hyperkale-mia. In clinical trials, the effects of sodium bicar-bonate have been either nonexistent or signicantlyless than the treatments listed above. 7,11At this time, sodium bicarbonate should no longer be used as a rst-line treatment for hyperkalemia but couldstill be considered for refractory cases when othertreatments are not sufcient. 3. Results Treatment of hyperkalemia is often transient andprovides a bridge until the primary medical condi-tion can be resolved. Cases of HYPP may resolve 226 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSINTERNAL MEDICINEquickly and long-term management can prevent fu-ture episodes. A ruptured bladder can be repairedsurgically with an excellent prognosis. However,conditions with a more guarded long-term prognosis(acute renal failure) may show initial improvementonly to relapse later. As a general rule, hyperkale-mia will be easier to manage in horses with a func-tioning renal system than in those patients in whichurine is not being produced. 4. Discussion Equine practitioners can use the described treat-ment approach for the initial management of hyper-kalemia. The simple combination of fluids andadditives listed below is easy to create and can belife saving. Practical Treatment of Equine Hyperkalemia 1. A 5-L bag of a balanced and isotonic crystalloid solution 2. Add 500 mL of 50% dextrose3. Add 0.5 mL of regular insulin (100 units/mL)4. Add 500 mL of 23% calcium gluconate This fluid mixture can be administered in a quantity of 10 mL/kg over approximately 1 hour. Inhaledalbuterol can be administered if IV fluid therapy willbe delayed. For longer-term care, continued IV flu-ids with dextrose and insulin may be warranted aswell as furosemide administration.

Materials and Methods The study had two phases: a main effectivenessphase and a follow-on eld safety phase. The effec-tiveness phase was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, randomized study. Thesafety was eld study. Randomization was 3:1 (dipy-rone:placebo). Dipyrone was administered at 30mg/kg by IV injection. Horses were required tohave rectal temperature /H11350102.0\u00b0F to be enrolled.3. Results A total of 138 horses were enrolled into the study and 130 horses were determined to be evaluable forthe effectiveness analysis. Responders were de-ned as a decrease in temperature /H113502\u00b0F or a tem- perature of /H11349101.0\u00b0F 6 hours after dose administration. Seventy-six of 99 dipyrone-treatedhorses (76.8%) and 6/31 of placebo treated horses(19.4%) were responders ( P/H11021.0001). Post-treat- ment adverse events were mild and transient, withno notable gastrointestinal adverse effects noted;however, specic diagnostics for gastric or coloniculceration were not performed. 4.

Introduction The acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) hasbeen shown to be a useful inflammatory parameterin the horse, given that it maintains low levels inhealth and increases as much as 1000-fold in re-sponse to inflammation. The goal of this study wasto evaluate SAA responses in horses with infectiousand noninfectious respiratory diseases as well ashealthy, control horses. 2. Materials and Methods Two hundred and seven horses were grouped into thefollowing categories: ssequi), inflammatory airway disease (IAD), and healthy controls. SAA concentrations were de-termined for all horses on serum using a stall-sidelateral flow immunoassay platform (StableLab). 3. Results SAA levels were found to be signicantly higher forinfectious respiratory diseases (equine influenza vi-rus, equine herpesvirus-4, S. equi ss equi) and horses with IAD when compared with controlhorses. There was a signicant difference betweenviral and bacterial infections and IAD.

Ramey, fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is not specic for the occurrence of equinegastric ulcers (EGUs), and should not be used for diagnosis of this condition. Authors' addresses: PO Box 4018, Sunland, CA 91041 (Ramey); Hospital, Chino Hills, CA 91709(Murrell, Fischer, Brauer, Klohnen); Fielding School of Public Health, University of California-Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 Introduction This study assesses the utility of commercially avail-able fecal occult blood test (FOBT) afor the diagnosis of gastric ulcers in a clinical population of horses. 2. Materials and Methods Eighty-one consecutive horses of various ages, sexes,and breeds presented to a referral equine hospitalwere examined by gastroscopy for EGUs, and thentested with the FOBT. Exclusion criteria includedyounger than 6 months of age, external signs ofbleeding around the face or mouth, racing or dentalwork in the 48 hours preceding gastroscopy, anthel-mintic treatment in the 5 days preceding gastros-copy, colic surgery with an enterotomy, evidence ofmild (grade 1) gastric ulceration, recent known ovu-lation. A FOBT test was performed on each horseafter gastroscopy. 3. Results Both fecal albumin and fecal hemoglobin tests havehigh sensitivity, that is, each test gives a positive re-sult virtually every time a horse is tested, regardless ofwhether it has EGUs. However, each test has ex- tremely low specicity in that when a horse does nothave an ulcer, the tests are still positive most of thetime. This results in a very low measure of associa-tion between the test and the diagnosis. 4. Discussion The FOBT used in this study does not accuratelydiagnose EGUs. Given the potential costs of treat-ment, initiating treatment for gastric ulcers basedthe FOBT used in this study is not recommended.At present, a conrmed diagnosis of EGUs still re-quires gastroscopic examination.

Therefore, vaccination does not interferewith serologic testing for naturally occurring WNVand EEE infections.Diagnosis of WNV and EEE virus is based on clinicalsigns and a /H110221:400 serum IgM titer. There is no reported information on the effect of recent vaccina-tion on serum IgM antibody response in horses andfoals and how recent vaccination might lead to afalse-positive capture ELISA test. The purpose ofthis study was to measure IgM in serum samplestaken from horses and foals recently vaccinated with a multivalent vaccine containing WNV andEEE antigens to determine whether recent vacci-nation would lead to a false-positive CaptureELISA test for viral encephalitis. Six adulthorses (ages 8-25 y) and six 4-month-old ponyfoals and their dams were used in the study.The horses and foals were vaccinated using a mul-tivalent product acontaining killed WNV and EEE antigens.

Introduction AAEP Vaccination Guidelines include rabies as a corevaccine against which all horses in North Americashould be revaccinated annually. In contrast, revac-cination intervals of 3 years are recommended for thesame inactivated rabies vaccines in dogs and cats,based in part on documentation of persistence of rabiesvirus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titers at protec-tive for a prolonged period. Sim- ilar data are not available for horses. 2. Materials and Methods Forty-eight adult horses with undocumented vaccina-tion status were vaccinated with one dose of an inac-tivated rabies vaccine. Serum samples were collectedprior to vaccination, at 3-7 weeks post-vaccination,and at 6-month intervals for 2-3 years thereafter. RVNA levels were measured using rapid fluorescentfocus inhibition test. Serological data from pre- andpost-vaccination samples were used to predict whichhorses had likely been vaccinated previously andwhich were likely na\u00efve. Duration of persistence ofRVNA levels /H110220.5 IU/mL, the level predicted to be protective, was assessed for both groups. Statistical Analysis A mixed-effects linear regression model was used toanalyze RVNA levels for 2-3 years post-vaccination. 3. Results All horses that were predicted to have been vacci-nated previously maintained RVNA levels above 0.5 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 235INTERNAL MEDICINE Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding authorNOTESIU/mL for the duration of the study (2-3 y).

RVNA levels /H113500.5 IU/mL persisted for /H110221 year in only one of the seven na\u00efve horses. 4.

Introduction Chloramphenicol is routinely recommended for thetreatment of a variety of bacterial infections in thehorse. The recommended susceptibility breakpointfor chloramphenicol by the Clinical Laboratory Stan-dards Institute is 8.0 /H9262g/mL. The authors hypothe- size that this level is not achievable in adult horseswith the commonly prescribed dose rate of 50 mg/kg bymouth every 6 hours, and therefore a lower meaninhibitory concentration (MIC) should be targeted. 2. Materials and Methods Seven horses were administered chloramphenicolpalmitate tablets orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg bymouth every 6 hours for 16 doses. Blood was col-lected at regular intervals for analysis using liquidchromatography-mass spectrometry. 3. Results The physical examination parameters were normalfor each horse. Although 3/7 horses developed softfeces, no other adverse reactions occurred. If chlor-amphenicol was administered every 6 hours, 6/7 horses achieved adequate plasma concentrations for/H1135050% of the dosing interval to target bacteria with a MIC/H113492.0 /H9262g/mL. All horses had plasma concen- trations /H113501/H9262g/mL for long enough to reliably target bacteria with a MIC /H113491/H9262g/mL. 4. Discussion Clinicians who intend on using chloramphenicol should obtain a MIC for target bacteria rather thanrelying on laboratory interpretation according to Clin-ical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, whichmistakenly categorize bacteria as susceptible to chlor-amphenicol based on an unachievable MIC in adulthorses.

Introduction Equine tendon and ligament injuries are commonlyencountered in sport horses and in the generalequine population. This paper will review currentmethods for treatment of equine soft-tissue injuries.Methods presented will therapeuticultrasound, extracorporeal shockwave therapy(ESWT), and low-level laser therapy. 2. Initial Therapy for Acute Injuries An accurate diagnosis with measurement of tendon/ligament and lesion cross-sectional area is impera-tive before initiating treatment for soft-tissueinjuries. Quantitative measures obtained on sono-grams allow for objective assessment of healing,help determine the rehabilitation exercise program,and identify the effect of other treatment modalitiesin use. Treatment of acute soft-tissue injuriesshould include the following: cessation of exercise,cold therapy, NSAIDs, and support bandaging tocontrol swelling. 3. Cold Therapy Cold therapy should be initiated immediately follow-ing injury and continued for 7-14 days. The majorphysiologic benets of cold therapy are decreasedlocal circulation, decreased pain, and reduced tissueswelling. 1These benets are most effective earlyin the period following injury. The primary effect of local cold application is to constrict blood vesselsand reduce tissue temperature. Reduced blood flowwill reduce edema, hemorrhage, and extravasationof inflammatory cells. Cold reduces tissue metabo-lism and may inhibit the effect of inflammatorymediators and slow enzyme systems. 2Cyclical re- bound vasodilatation is another response to coldtherapy. Following a minimum of 15 minutes ofcold therapy that reaches tissue temperatures from10-15\u00b0C, cycles of vasoconstriction and vasodilata-tion occur. Vasodilatation associated with coldtherapy may help further resolve tissue edema. Cold immersion of the distal limbs is also effective in reducing severity of laminitis by decreasing theactivity of laminar matrix metalloprotease vasoconstriction when appliedduring the phase. Cold may be applied by ice-water immersion, ap- plication of ice packs or cold packs, and ice water-charged circulating bandages or boots. The mostbenecial therapeutic effects of cold occur at tissuetemperatures between 15 and 19\u00b0C (59-66\u00b0F). 2 Direct contact of ice water with the skin is the mosteffective method of cold therapy. Buckets or turbu- lator boots may be used depending on the site.Recently, a study identied a simple way to effec-tively cool the distal limb using a bag-within-a-bagtechnique. 5Empty 5-L fluid bags are on /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 241IN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATION NOTESdistal limb and secured with ice between the bags.Ice-water immersion of the equine digit for 30 min-utes decreases in laminartemperatures. Vascular perfusion decreased, butnot signicantly. 5 Cold therapy is indicated in acute injuries to re- duce edema, slow the inflammatory response, andreduce pain. It is particularly effective during therst 24-48 hours after injury. Cold should be ap-plied for 30 minutes three or four times daily duringthe acute phase of injury. This modality is alsovery useful to apply to the injury site following re-habilitation exercise during the convalescent period. 4. Exercise Controlled exercise remains the most importantmethodology for rehabilitation of soft-tissue inju-ries. Exercise is necessary to align the newly syn-thesized collagen brils along the lines of stress inthe limb. 6Without the addition of controlled stress to the injured ligament or tendon, the lesion would heal with disorganized scar. Exercise is slowly in-creased as indicated by interpretation of sequentialultrasound and lameness examinations (Table 1).Hand walking for 5-10 minutes once or twice daily(depending on lesion severity) should begin verysoon after injury to encourage optimal ber align-ment and prevent restrictive adhesions. Ultra-sound and lameness evaluations should be repeatedevery 8-10 weeks and exercise levels may be in-creased as parameters improve. According to Gil-lis, controlled exercise alone resulted in successfuloutcomes for 67-71% of horses with soft-tissue inju-ries. Pasture turn-out resulted in successful out-comes in 25-51% of horses. 7 All exercise must be adjusted for the level of soundness. If there is increased lameness, swellingis noted at the injury site, or ultrasound parametersdeteriorate, the exercise level must be decreased.Work at the trot should only begin after a solid10-15 minutes of hand walking for warmup. Ini-tially, time at the trot should be broken into short1-1.5-minute segments.5. Regenerative Therapy Regenerative therapy is a common term for the use of biological agents to repair and restore damagedtissues. The ultimate goal for use of these modali-ties is to improve the quality of repair. Regenera-tive therapies include stem cells derived from sitessuch as bone marrow and umbilical cord, fat-derivedregenerative cells, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and autologous conditioned serum (ACS). 8,9These techniques enhance matrix and collagen production, recruit stem cells, and enhance cytokine levels.ACS contains PDGF, IGF-I, and VEGF, experiment equine tendinitis, a single intralesional injection ofPRP was found to result in increased collagen, gly-cosaminoglycans, and DNA content compared withcontrols. The tendons treated with PRP also hadhigher strength and improved elastic modulus.The PRP tendons had enhanced collagen organiza-tion and increased metabolic activity. 10This study is very strong evidence for the positive effects of PRP for treatment of equine soft-tissue injuries. PRPhas high levels of PDGF and TGF- other cytokines.9Growth factors such as IGF improve tendon healing in vitro and in /H9252enhances collagen production in cultured equine tendon cells.9 Injection of stem cells to treat a soft-tissue lesion via intralesional, IV, or intrarterial approaches wasoriginally hoped to result in healing with tissuecharacteristic of the original tendon or ligament. 8,13 Additional effects of stem cells include stimulationof local vasculature, release of a variety of cytokinesthat enhance healing, inhibition of T and B lympho-cytes and killer-T cells, and recruitment of localstem cells. 8,13 PRP and stem-cell sources may be autologous or allogeneic.

AllogeneicPRP and stem cells have been used in horses andfound to be safe and effective. 14 PRP or stem cells are injected 21-30 days after injury or at a time when other therapies have notbeen effective in resolving the lesion. The horse isoften administered a single dose of parenteral anti-biotics such as ceftiofur (2.2 mg/kg IV). The site isaseptically prepared and regional anesthesia is usedto desensitize the area of injection. The injectionsare usually placed with ultrasound control. A ster-ile bandage is applied and left in place for 2 days.Following injection, the horse is conned and onlyallowed hand grazing. Bandaging is continued for2 weeks. At 2 weeks following injection, the in-hand exercise regimen that was being used beforeinjection is resumed. Follow-up ultrasound andlameness evaluations are made approximately 30days later. In the author's practice, PRP is used to treat mod- erate to severe soft tissue injuries. Stem cells areused to treat moderate to severe injuries that in-clude considerable tissue loss. Either modality isused to treat lesions that have failed to continuehealing regardless of the original treatment methodused. Most horses are treated with only one injec-tion of PRP or stem cells. 6. Therapeutic Ultrasound Therapeutic ultrasound (US) is useful for treatmentof soft-tissue injuries. The modality may be usedbetween ESWTs or used on its own. Therapeutic ultrasound selectively heats tissue with high protein/collagen content. The most in-tense heating occurs at tissue interfaces. Equinemuscle does not heat to the same degree as dogmuscle treated with US. 15,16However, equine ten - dons and ligaments are heated substantially whenexposed to therapeutic US. As reported by Mont-gomery et al, 15supercial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) mean temperature deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) fol-lowing 10 minutes of treatment at 1.0 W/cm 2.I n the 1.5 W/cm2treatment group, mean temperature increase was 5.2\u00b0C in the SDFT and 3.0\u00b0C in the DDFT.15 Increased tissue temperatures enhance tissue me- tabolism and likely increase local circulation. Bothof these effects of therapeutic US support tissuehealing. An additional benet of therapeutic US isthe deep massage of tissues caused by the soundwaves referred to as cavitation and streaming offluids and ions. 17These nonthermal effects result in compression and expansion of tissues and tissue fluids that may improve tissue healing.2Fibrous connective tissue scars may be more effectively stretched following heating with therapeutic US. Treatment is usually performed once or twice daily for 10 to 14 days. Hair must be clipped, theskin cleaned with a moist cloth, and US-coupling gelmust be applied to provide good contact between the transducer and the skin. In horses, treatment formost supercial tendon or ligament injuries is con-ducted with a 3-MHz transducer at 1 W/cm 2for 10 minutes twice daily. Low-intensity US may be applied for 2-3 hours of treatment for acute injuries and 4-6 hours oncedaily for chronic injuries. A commercially availablelow-intensity ultrasound device has output perma-nently set at 2.75 MHz at 0.85 W/cm 2. For acces - sible anatomic locations, the device is placed on thelimb for the appropriate treatment time a. 7. ESWT ESWT results in reduced levels of inflammatory me-diators, increased collagen production, 18,19small vessel proliferation,18growth factors,18,19and re - cruitment of stem cells. Improved outcomes suspensory desmitis have been reported fol-lowing ESWT. 20,21The pressure-tension gradient of the sound energy pulse is responsible for the biological effects. Most ESWT is conducted be-tween 0.25 and 0.45 mJ/mm 2. Low-level ESWT en - ergy provides the most benecial regenerativeeffects to tissue. 18,19,22 The full course of treatment consists of three to ve ESWT applications at 2-3-week intervals.The most common settings for treatment afocused shockwave device are 1500-2000 impulses,energy at 0.25-0.4 mJ/mm 2, focused at the depth of the lesion. ESWT is often the primary treatment modality for many soft-tissue injuries. 8. Laser Therapy Low-level laser therapy is benecial for wound ther-apy, pain reduction, and healing of soft-tissue inju-ries. The biological effects of laser identied inresearch settings include release of endorphins,blocking of pain sensation through reduced nervedepolarization, enhanced adenosine triphosphate(ATP) production, and reduced IL-1 levels. In a ratmodel of Achilles tendinitis, laser therapy improvedtendon strength and reduced inflammatory cyto-kines more than treatment with diclofenac. 23La- ser light energy is optimally absorbed through theskin at wavelengths of 805-980 nm. The dose ofenergy required for treatment depends on the na-ture of the injury, depth of the tissue, and desiredeffect (biostimulation or anti-inflammatory/pain re-lief). A recent study by Haussler 24found laser com - bined with chiropractic therapy to result in morepain relief for equine back pain than laser or chiro-practic alone. Recommended treatment doseranges from 4 to 12 J/cm 2.25The most challenging issue with laser treatment is delivering an effective dose to the target tissues. Absorption and disper-sal of the laser energy by the skin, hair, and deepertissues signicantly reduces the energy at the treat-ment PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 243IN-DEPTH: LAMENESS Conclusion With the wide variety of treatment modalities avail-able for treatment of soft-tissue injuries, choicesmust be made based on the level of injury, expecta-tions for results, and cost factors. The most impor-tant approach for care of soft-tissue injuries remainsrestriction from free exercise, repeated characteriza-tion of the lesion (usually via lameness evaluationand sonography), and initial anti-inflammatorytreatment (cold therapy and medication). This isfollowed by appropriate rehabilitation exercise.For mild injuries, conservative therapy, as outlinedabove, is appropriate and entails modest cost. Formore serious injuries, or for injuries that havestopped progressive healing, ESWT, PRP, or stemcells are recommended to stimulate the healing re-sponse. Regenerative modalities have moderate-to-high costs to the client. At this point, directcomparisons of treatment response to the variousmodalities reported here are not available.

Introduction The goal of a rehabilitation program is to return thehorse to its previous level of tness and function inthe shortest amount of time. In humans there aremany studies that have been performed that havedemonstrated efcacy of many modalities or tech-niques for specic conditions. However, in thehorse there is less information available in the formof evidence-based medicine. There is little work inthe equine to validate the efcacy of different ther-apeutic modalities. Many of the treatments havebeen adapted from humans for which there is betterevidence of efcacy. There is no reason not to usemodalities that have been demonstrated to be ef-cacious in the human; however, efcacy determina-tion must still be done in the equine. 2. Therapeutic Plan Development It is important not use a \"shotgun\" approach whendeveloping and implementing a therapeutic plan.Also, rehabilitation is a team approach consisting ofthe veterinarian, therapist, owner, as well as otherprofessionals. All members of the team need to beinformed and \"on board\" to insure the best possibleoutcome. There are several items that must be considered when developing a rehabilitation program for anindividual. First, what has been your success with patients with a similar condition and how have they progressed during the treatment? Second isthe establishment of outcome goals, such as whatshould be the patient's progress during the reha-bilitation process? Third, determine your capa-bilities and the resources you have available.Lastly, patient assessment is performed to deter-mine nature of the injury, type of therapy or sur-gery that has been performed, patient disposition,and what owner expectations are. You then de-velop a plan for the patient based on the answersto these questions. The stage of the injury will affect the type of plan developed. The initial stage is from the timeof injury or surgery until all inflammation hasresolved. The goal of therapy during this stage isdecreasing pain and inflammation, preservingrange of motion, and prevention of muscle atro- phy. Typically, cold therapy, low-level laser ther-apy, supportive wraps, and passive motion is usedin this period. The second stage starts when inflammation is re- solving. During this stage you need to graduallyincrease the stress that the healing tissues are sub-jected to. You are trying to prevent scar tissuefrom developing or revising it. Therapies include AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 245IN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATION NOTEStherapeutic exercise, therapy, therapeuticultrasound, shockwave, as well as others. Which modality to use in which stage is dependent upon one's expertise, available resources, and whatyou are trying to accomplish. 3. Therapeutic Monitoring It is important to develop methods for measuringthe response of the condition to therapy. Youshould try using quantiable methods. Simplemethods are available. For instance, tape mea-sures may be used to measure limb circumference,goniometers can be used to measure joint angles, 1 and pressure algometry may be used to measuredecreasing pain in an area. 2Other methods in - clude diagnostic imaging, thermography, or Lame-ness Locator. 3 Measurements should be taken at the onset of therapy and at set intervals. Early in the therapyevaluations, they may need to be performed daily orweekly, whereas later they may need to be donemonthly. If the condition worsens or no improve-ment is noted during therapy, the plan should bemodied. 4. Facilities, Equipment, and Personnel When developing a rehabilitation practice it is im-portant to read the State Veterinary Practice Act.Most states consider performing animal rehabilita-tion as the practice of veterinary medicine. If aperson is not a veterinarian then they will need to bea full-time employee of a veterinarian or horseowner. The level of supervision required will needto be determined, if an individual is a full-time em-ployee of a veterinarian. Most states allow a li-censed veterinary technician to work under indirectsupervision. However, laws vary from state tostate and should be reviewed for the state in whicha person is working. Individuals developing rehabilitation plans, per- forming therapies, and monitoring progressionshould be thoroughly trained. This training shouldbe more in depth than the technical service train- ing usually received when purchasing equipment.There are advanced training courses available orthey can spend several weeks at an equine rehabil-itation center. A major problem in the eld ofequine rehabilitation is lack of formal education andtraining. In some cases, therapies are providedthat are of little benet or may be detrimental.Advanced training is available for equine rehabili-tation, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, chiropractic, andacupuncture, to name a few. The demographics of the area must be evaluated before establishing a rehabilitation service. Theconcentration of horses in the area needs to be de-termined. The equine disciplines, types of clients,and other rehabilitation facilities in the area are afew other items that should be considered. They type of rehabilitation service offered is im- portant. An ambulatory practice will limit the typeof equipment and service you can provide. Ambu- latory service will be limited to equipment that canbe easily transported and therapeutic exercises.A rehabilitation service at a brick-and-mortar facil-ity will be able to provide a wider range of therapies. Equipment needs will depend on all the factors presented above. For an ambulatory service,equipment that should be considered includes ther-apeutic ultrasound, therapeutic laser, thermal ther-apies, shockwave therapy, and equipment toperform therapeutic monitoring. For a haul-in fa-cility, equipment in addition to that mentionedabove includes underwater treadmill, swimmingpool, a cold-salt therapy unit, whole-body vibration,and pulsed electromagnetic therapy, to name a few. All of the above equipment need not be obtained initially, but future needs should be anticipated.For instance, if funds are not available to purchasean underwater treadmill, one should still plan forone in the future. Location and housing of theequipment need to be planned for. Most equipmentis expensive, ranging from several hundred dollarsto several thousand dollars. In addition to the pur-chase price of the equipment, one must account formaintenance cost. In determining the charge for aservice, this should be taken into account in additionto the time it takes to perform the therapy, as wellas appropriate fee setting. If you have a low num-ber of cases then you may have to charge a signi-cant amount to recoup the expenses. That is why itis extremely important to determine whether theservice area can support the equipment prior topurchase. 5. Nutrition Nutrition is important rehabilitation. Painfulhorses that are in the process of healing have spe-cic nutritional requirements. 4,5Horses are prone to development of gastric ulcers. Things to con- sider include the feeding of a non-grain-based dietand alfalfa hay. The obese horse may only needgrass hay and a ration balancer. Horses that are ina catabolic state may require additional calories.Finally, all horse should have fresh water and a saltblock. 6. Patient Environment and Mental Status During therapy one should not neglect the rest of thepatient. We often successfully treat the injury butlose the use of the horse due to other problems thatarise. Providing a good environment, good nutri-tion, and supporting other limbs are oftentimes asimportant as the treatment itself. Do not neglectthe mental status of the horse. Mental stimulationis needed if long period connement is required. 7. Manual Therapies for Joints Manual therapies include massage, stretches, andtissue mobilization. These help by restoring opti-mum joint movement by reducing adhesions, mobi-lizing joint structures, and enhancing joint 246 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATIONlubrication and joint nutrition. They may be usedin both the acute or chronic condition. Stretching and Massage Stretching and massage can increase blood flow,alleviate muscle spasms, mobilize scar tissue, andaid lymphatic drainage. They also provide pain re-lief from tight muscles and connective tissue thatimpinge on nerves, aid in restoration muscle lengthafter injury, and decrease stiffness-related inactiv-ity. Static or passive stretching consists of stretch-ing a muscle to its limit and then maintaining orholding the stretch in that position. 6The desired motion and positioning are controlled and are not under control of the horse. It is unknown how ef-fective stretching is. In a group of horses, Roseet al 7found no improvement in stride length after several weeks of stretching. They did, however, nd differences in joint range of motion betweentreatments in the shoulder, stifle, and hock. Theyconcluded that frequency of application of passivestretches seems to have some influence on horsemovement, but their research did not demonstrateconsistent improvement. They also highlightedthe possibility that stretching on a daily basis maybe contraindicated and suggested that stretchingthree times per week may be safer. The rationale for massage is supported by human research indicating that it may affect certain phys-iologic systems in addition to cellular and fascialcomponents of the muscular system. 8,9Equine massage uses techniques rst developed in humans that have been reported to increase range of motion,reduce activity of pain receptors, and reduce stressresponses. 9However, the evidence in the horse is weak other than suggesting that massage is of any benet other than promoting lymphatic drainage.10 Only one study could be found that indicated thatmassage to the caudal limb muscles increased pas-sive and active limb protraction. 8 Mobilization Mobilization is aimed at pain relief, restoration ofnormal joint biomechanics and nerve function, andimproved muscle function. It is used to treat jointdysfunction that limits the range of motion by ad-dressing altered mechanics. Factors that may in-fluence joint mechanics include pain, jointhypomobility, joint effusion, contractures, brosis ofthe joint capsule or periarticular ligaments, and de-generative joint disease. Passive mobilization is used for increasing range of motion or decreasing pain. 11It is applied at varying speeds, amplitudes, or rhythm. The force is light enough that the horse can stop the move-ment. 11Active mobilization is an active joint movement that is carried out and controlled by the horse.11 The majority of mobilization studies in the horse have been directed toward the axial skele-ton. Clayton et al 12found that the degree of bend -ing in parts of the cervical vertebral column differed among the active mobilization exercises. As thehorse's head moved further caudally, bending in thelower cervical and thoracolumbar regions increased.This suggests that bending in the more caudal posi-tions may be effective for activating and strengtheningthe core musculature that stabilize the horse's back. 12 Clayton12also found that active mobilization per - formed in cervical flexion aids in mobilizing the cervi-cal and thoracic intervertebral joints. Haussleret al 13found that passive vertical mobility of the trunk varied from cranial to caudal. In another study, chi- ropractic manipulation of the spine increased dorso-ventral displacement of the trunk. 14They concluded that this is indicative of producing increased passive spinal flexibility in actively ridden horses. Based on the human literature, it has been rec- ommended that mobilization for most injuries andpost surgery can begin within 3 days. Careful pro-tocols must be followed through. For severe liga-ment and tendon injuries, mobilization can begin at3 weeks post injury. 15 8. Thermal Agents Heat and cold may be administered to horses usingmany modalities that can range from applying coldwater from a hose to deep-heating ultrasoundtechnologies. Cold The main benet of cold therapy is to decrease cir-culation, lower cell metabolism, prevent secondarytissue damage, decrease edema, and decreasepain. 16It is most effective early following injury or surgery. The primary effect is to constrict blood vessels. This reduction in blood flow reducesedema, hemorrhage, and extravasation of inflamma-tory cells. The lower cell metabolism decreases theeffect of inflammatory mediators and slows enzy-matic systems. Cold therapy is indicated for acute injuries or inflammation and after surgery to reduce edema,slow inflammation, and provide analgesia. Cold isparticularly effective during the rst 24-48 hoursafter injury or surgery. Cold may be applied by icewater immersion, application of cold packs, cold saltwater hydrotherapy units, and ice water circulatingboots. Studies have documented tissue effects of cryo- therapy in horses. The influence of hypertonic coldwater (5-9\u00b0C) spa bath hydrotherapy on the re-sponse of 27 horses with various lower leg injurieshas been reported. 17Fifteen horses with super - cial digital flexor (SDF) tendonitis and four withsuspensory ligament desmitis that were treated for10 minutes, three times a week responded with im-proved ultrasonographic echogenicity of injured tis-sues. Of these 15 horses, all but two returned tocompete successfully within 6 months without re-injury. Petrovo et al 18reduced the core tempera - ture of the SDF tendon to 10\u00b0C after 1 hour a 247IN-DEPTH: LAMENESS circulatingcoolant. This indicated that topical applicationof cold can reduce core SDF tendon temperature instanding horses and that the temperaturesachieved during treatment were not detrimentalto the viability of the cells. Cold immersion of thedistal limbs has also been shown to be effective inreducing the severity of laminitis by decreasingthe Heat The benets of heat include increased circulation,muscle relaxation, and increased tissue pliability. 21 When tissue blood flow is increased, metabolites aremobilized, oxygen levels are increased, and the met-abolic rate of cells and enzyme systems are in-creased. The metabolic rate increases two to threetimes for an increase of 10\u00b0C. Increases in bloodflow and vascular permeability can promote tissueedema resorption. Heat can also decrease pain viasimilar mechanisms to cold therapy. Tissues aremore effectively stretched after warming. Heattherapy can be used to increase joint and tendonmobility. Heat is usually applied after the acuteinflammatory period has ended. Heat is commonly applied using hot packs. Deep heat may be applied using therapeutic ultrasound.Most of the physiologic effects of heat occur whentissue temperatures are raised to between 40 and45\u00b0C. 21Tissue temperatures above 45\u00b0C may re - sult in tissue damage.21To achieve heating of deeper tissues to the therapeutic range, constant heat must be applied for 15-30 minutes. Kaneps21 found that tissue temperature changes due to warmwater hose therapy ranged from 3.7 to 10.8\u00b0C.Temperature elevation is short lasting and dependson the distance to the surface, with limited effect ontissues deeper than 1.5-2 cm below the skinsurface. 21 Using therapeutic ultrasound, Montgomery et al22 found that the SDF tendon and deep digital flexortendon (DDFT) are heated to a therapeutic temper-ature using a frequency of 3.3 MHz and intensity of1.0 W/cm 2. However, the epaxial muscles are not heated to a therapeutic temperature using a fre- quency of 3.3 MHz and an intensity of 1.5 W/cm2.22 9. Low-Level Laser Therapy The low-level laser uses an intense beam of light tostimulate the body's processes. It is reported toactivate waste removal, increase repair activity, re-lieve swelling, heal skin wounds, and stimulate theblood and lymphatic systems. 23It has been re - ported to increase serotonin.23-25It has been re - ported to have biostimulating effects such asacceleration of cell division, increase in leucocyticphagocytosis, stimulation of broblastic activity,and enhancing regeneration of lymph and blood ves-sels. 23-25Studies have shown it can cause vasodi - latation.23-25All of these effects can assist healingand provide some relief of chronic pain when prop- erly applied. Lasers are divided into safety classications in the United States by the American National StandardInstitute. Class 1, 2, and 3a have low power outputand are not used for therapeutic purposes. Thesewill not be presented. Class 3b lasers cannot emit an average radiant power greater than 0.5 W for an exposure time equalto or greater than 0.25 seconds or 0.125 J for anexposure time less than 0.25 seconds for wave-lengths between 0.18 and 0.4 /H9262m, or between 1.4 and 1 mm. In addition, lasers between 0.4 and 1.4 /H9262m exceeding the Class 3a accessible emission limit (AEL) cannot emit an average radiant power greaterthan 0.5 W for exposures equal to or greater than0.25 seconds, or a radiant energy greater than 0.03 Jper pulse. Class 4 lasers and laser systems exceedthe Class 3b AEL.There is little research on the use of low-level lasertherapy (LLLT) in the equine. morphological changes in mis after treatment with 91 J/cm2of defocused CO2 laser and severe changes with a homogeneous acellular zone of underlying dermis irradiationdoses of 450 J/cm 2were applied. Berg et al27also found that irradiation with defocused CO2laser causes a moderate-to-vigorous heating effect in su- percial tissue and a marked increase in blood flow.This increase in temperature could increase the riskof thermal injuries to the skin. 27The results also suggest that treatment with defocused CO2laser is not statistically better than placebo at reducing the grade of lameness in horses with traumatic arthritisof the fetlock joint. 27Ryan et al28found that laser- light transmission was not affected by individual horse, coat color, or leg. However, it was associatedwith leg condition. Tendons clipped dry andcleaned with alcohol were both associated withgreater transmission of light than the unpreparedlimbs. The use of alcohol without clipping did notassociate increase laser light transmission. Theyrecommended that the area treated should beclipped and cleaned beforehand. The wavelengths of light used for LLLT fall into an \"optical window\" at red used to treat supercial tis- sue, and longer wavelengths in the range 780-950nm, which penetrate farther, are used to treat deep-er-seated tissues. 29Wavelengths in the range 700-770 nm have been found to have limited bio- chemical activity and are therefore not used.29 The most common method of determining laser therapy dosage is to measure the density of energyapplied to the surface. This is typically expressedin J/cm 2. Variation in clinical effects can be ob - served at very high (/H1102250 W) or very low (/H110211W ) power settings using the same J/cm2dose. The dose required for a particular condition is dependent 248 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATIONon the equipment used and what its wavelength is.As a general rule, the more supercial a tissue theless energy required. In our practice, the most common use of LLLT is to decrease pain and inflammation associated withmusculoskeletal injuries and for wound healing. 10. Mechanical Agent This group includes therapeutic ultrasound, shock-wave, and devices such as whole-body vibrationunits. Therapeutic Ultrasound Therapeutic ultrasound is a form of acoustic energyused to treat musculoskeletal injuries. It offersdeeper heating without excessive heating of theskin. Ultrasound can also be used to decrease painand muscle spasm, promote wound healing, aid re-absorption of hematoma, reduce swelling, and re-duce scar tissue. It increases blood flow in the areatreated and increases cell membrane permeability toions and other substances. It blocks signal trans-mission in nerves and decreases muscle spasms.It has been shown in clinical and scientic trials toincrease collagen extensibility, enhance collagen re-modeling, enhance collagen production, increaseheat in deep tissues, increase blood flow, increaserange of motion, reduce pain and muscle spasm, andaccelerate wound healing. Therapeutic effects of ultrasound are both ther- mal and nonthermal. Thermal effects are achievedby heating tissue using continuous-wave ultra-sound. 30Thermal effects result from energy car - ried by ultrasonic waves being attenuated andabsorbed by tissue as the waves pass through it. 31 Some of the positive effects of heat produced bytherapeutic ultrasound include improved extensibil-ity of collagen, decreased pain, decreased musclespasms, and increased blood flow. 31-33Nonther - mal effects result from mechanical alteration of thelocal, cellular environment induced by the ultra-sound waves. 31,34To avoid heating the treated tis - sue and achieve nonthermal effects, pulsedultrasound is used where pulse rates interrupt thesound waves at rates of 50, 80, or 90%. 30Changes in cellular environment may lead to modications incellular function resulting in a shorter inflammatoryphase of healing, increased vascularity at the treat-ment site, and enhanced proliferation of bro-blasts. 31,32,34,35Nonthermal ultrasound has been used as an adjunct therapy for patients with a frac- ture or a tendinopathy.34,36 The temperature needed to achieve the desired therapeutic effect for thermal ultrasound has beenestablished in humans. 32,37,38An increase of 1\u00b0C is required to increase the metabolic rate of tissue, an increase of 2-4\u00b0C is required to decrease pain, mus-cle spasms, and inflammation, and improve bloodflow, and an increase /H113503\u00b0C is required to decrease the viscoelastic properties of collagen. 32,37,38For people, 1-MHz ultrasound is most effective at in-creasing temperature at a depth of 2.5-5 cm, and 3.3-MHz ultrasound is most effective at increasingtemperature at a depth of 1.0-2.5 cm. 37Results of a study performed to evaluate the effects of 3.3-MHz ultrasound on the temperature of the thigh muscu-lature of dogs showed that using a 10-minute treat-ment at an intensity of 1.0 W/cm 2increases the temperature of tissue by 2-4\u00b0C at depths of 1.0 and 2.0 cm. At an intensity of 1.5 W/cm2, the tempera - ture of tissue increases by at least 2-4\u00b0C at depthsof 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 cm. 32 Research into the use of therapeutic ultrasound is lacking in the horse. Montgomery et al22found that the supercial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and DDFT are heated to a therapeutic temperature us-ing a frequency of 3.3 MHz and intensity of 1.0W/cm 2. However, the epaxial muscles are not heated to a therapeutic temperature using a fre- quency of 3.3 MHz and an intensity of 1.5 W/cm2. Reis et al,39using a frequency of 1 MHz on pulsed mode, at an intensity of 0.5 W/cm2for 5 minutes, treated collagenase-induced supercial flexor ten- don lesions for 60 days. They found no signicantdifference clinically between treated and untreatedlimbs at either 15 or 60 days. However, there wasa signicant improvement in ultrasonographic eval-uation at 60 days in treated limbs vs untreated.Singh et al 40evaluated the use of ultrasound for 10 minutes per day at 1 W/cm2for 6 days after induc - tion of arthritis in donkeys. They found that grosschanges in the joint capsule, synovial membrane,and articular cartilage were mild in ultrasound-treated donkeys compared with untreated controls. In the author's practice, therapeutic ultrasound is most commonly used for its heating effect on ten-dons and ligaments prior to exercise or mobiliza-tions. We use 3.3 MHz and intensity of 1.0 W/cm 2 11. Therapeutic Exercise The amount and intensity of therapeutic exercise isdependent upon the condition being treated, the ex-tent of the damage, the time of healing, and facilitiesavailable. Types include hand walking, riding, po-nying (leading a horse while riding another), me-chanical walker, underwater treadmill, swimmingpool, and turnout to paddock or pasture. Each pro-gram is tailored to the individual and may need to beadapted during the rehabilitation program. Also,ground obstacles (ground poles, cavalettis) may beincorporated to increase coordination and agility.In addition, changing the terrain may be included totarget specic areas (i.e., inclines to strengthen rearlimbs). The goal of therapeutic exercise is to pro-vide a gradual return to function and to improvestrength and coordination. Ground Exercises Ground exercises are exercises that are performedat hand or while being ridden. They are usuallytargeted at specic areas such as improvement inproprioception and coordination, of AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 249IN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATIONspecic muscles, improving joint mobility, and im-proving overall body condition. There are manytypes of exercises that may be used. It is oftenbased on the imagination of the therapist to developspecic exercises. One must take into account thenature of the patient and injury, the equipment andfacilities available, and the personnel. Many of thetherapeutic exercises are inexpensive and just re-quire time and personnel. The following paragraphillustrates some different methods. Proprioception and coordination may be improved by walking over ground poles placed in random fash-ion. Other congurations can be utilized. 3Differ - ent surface transitions may also be utilized such asgoing from grass to sand to gravel to water and thento asphalt. Different obstacles and pedestals canalso be utilized. 3Improving joint mobility can be accomplished by having cavallettis arranged likespokes on a wagon wheel and having the horsestep over them going in both directions. Placingbracelets or weights around the pasterns can alsobe utilized; 41-44however, horses will become ha - bituated to the devices.44Core muscle stability can be improved utilizing therapeutic bands placed around the caudal limbs or abdomen.3 Theses may be used at hand, lunging, or whilebeing ridden. Strengthening of rear limb muscu-lature may be accomplished by riding up and downgradual inclines or pulling a cart. This most com-monly has been used as a therapy for intermittentupward xation of the patella. Equine Aquatic Therapy Equine aquatic therapy primarily encompassesswimming and underwater treadmill. Whirlpools,salt water spas, and recovery pools are also exam-ples but will not be addressed in this pa-per. Equine swimming pools have been availablefor 25-30 years; however, prior to that oftentimesponds, lakes, or the ocean have been used. Many ofthe pools are located at tracks or barns. A fewveterinary hospitals and equine rehab centers alsohave these pools. The main drawback is the ex-pense on construction and the costs of maintenance. More recently, equine underwater treadmills have been developed to overcome the expense of construc-tion and maintenance of in ground pools. Theseunits also provide a more controlled environmentthan pools with a decreased possibility of injury. Swimming and underwater treadmill may provide several benets. They primarily provide cardiovas-cular conditioning without the stresses on the mus-culoskeletal system. 10In addition, they provide a different type of muscle exercise and also work dif-ferent groups of muscles than when working onland. Resistance to joint movement is also a benetthat is benecial to rehabilitation. The use of swimming and the underwater tread- mill in the rehabilitation of musculoskeletal injuriesis becoming more common. Their use allows thehorse to maintain cardiovascular tness, muscletone, and improve joint movement without undue stresses on the injured limb. The reason for thedecreased stresses placed on the limb is the buoy-ancy that the water provides. Depending on theheight or depth of water, a certain amount of thisdepends on the amount of water in relation to thebody mass of the horse. That is to say that a horseplaced in a small area will require less water to getto the level of the point of the shoulder. Because ofthe reduced amount of water there is less buoyancy;thus, more weight being born. Buoyancy is the force experienced as an upthrust, which acts in the opposite direction to the force ofgravity. 45A body immersed in the water seems to lose weight, and the weight loss is equal to the weight of water displaced.45Immersion in water allows for unweighting of tendons, ligaments, bones, and joints within the distal limb.46There is a re - duction ground reaction force leading to reducedconcussive stresses on joints and tendons, allowingfor exercise without further trauma induced byweight bearing or concussive forces. 47Reduced body weight decreases postoperative and convales- cent complications. McClintock et al46determined the weight reduction for a horse in a flotation tank lled with salt water. They found approximately a10% reduction in the weight born by the limbs whenthe saline was at the level of the olecranon. Whenthe saline was raised to the level of the tuber coxaethere was approximately a 75% reduction in weight. Immersion causes water displacement and in- creased hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatic pres-sure is the sum pressure exerted on all surfaces of abody immersed in water, for any given depth. 45 In humans this can cause redistribution of bloodflow from the peripheral limbs due to an isotonicfluid shift from extravascular space. 48It can also lead to a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels within 25-60 minutes of water immersion.48 Hydrostatic pressure will affect lung volumes, hencecare must be taken with patients with respiratorydistress or compromise. 45 Viscosity is the resistance of a fluid to motion.45 Viscosity of water increases as speed increases.This is due to increased turbulence and drag. Thisin turn increases the amount and intensity of workbeing performed. The addition of hydrojets to thepool or treadmill can increase the drag on limbmovement. Viscosity decreases as water tempera-ture increases. 45This means weaker and smaller muscles move more easily in warmer water.45 Relative density and specic gravity of an object will depend on the composition of the object and willdetermine whether an object will float or sink. 45 So, lean animals and heavily muscled animals havea tendency to sink and animals with a greateramount of body fat will float more easily. 45 Both swimming and underwater treadmill exer- cise are forms of aerobic exercise and help developcardiovascular tness. With water immersion,there is a decrease in systemic resistance 250 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATIONand the changes in total peripheral resistance aredependent on water temperature. 48 Following underwater treadmill exercise, there is a moderate but not signicant increase in blood lac-tate and plasma creatine phosphokinase levels. 49 Hemoglobin concentration is signicantly increasedas a result of the physical exercise. 50Voss et al50 concluded that underwater treadmill training, fol-lowing their training protocol, represents a medium-sized aerobic work load for horses. Swimming causes a signicant increase in blood pressure. 51However, the maximum heart rate ob - tained while swimming is less than that obtainedduring ground exercise. 51,52There seems to be no relationship between heart rate and duration of swimming.52There also seem to be increased car - diovascular benets while working at slowerspeeds. 52,53 Water pressure on the horse's body during swimming prevents adequate ventilation.53-55 Hobo et al53found an increase in respiratory rate, an increase in both inspiratory and expiratory pres- sure and that the expiratory time roughly doubledthe inspiratory time. This suggested that a longerexpiratory time may limit sudden collapse of air-ways by water pressure during swimming and pre-vent a marked decrease in air space volume andthus maintains buoyancy. 53There are no studies available on the effects of underwater treadmill ex- ercise on the respiratory function in horses. Walking in water at the level of the carpus or ulna resulted in a lower stride frequency and greaterstride length compared with walking in water athoof height. 56Water provides a resistance to move - ment of the limb in the sagittal plane; so an increasein height of the flight arc may also minimize theresistance experienced in swinging the limb backand forth. 56When moving in water between carpal and ulna heights, the horse may nd it easier to adopt a rounder flight arc by increasing flexion ofthe hip, stifle, and hock joints. Water treadmillexercise may increase activity of muscles that flexthe hip, flex the stifle, and protract the hindlimb. 56 Borgia et al57found no effect of water treadmill training on the properties of the gluteal and SDF muscles and on cardiocirculatory response to a stan-dardized exercise test. However, the author's statethat a more strenuous water treadmill conditioningprotocol may be needed to induce a training effect ingluteal and SDF muscle and heart rate response. 57 Firshman et al58found that 8 weeks of conventional or underwater treadmill training resulted in minor changes in type I muscle ber sizes with no effect onmuscle metabolic or heart rate responses to stan-dard exercise test. They recommended that afterrehabilitation involving underwater treadmills,training at progressing speeds is recommended forhorses to develop the required tness for speedwork. Evaluating the effects of swimming on 2-year-old Thoroughbreds in race training, Misumi et al 59found that fast-twitch, high-oxidative bers in-creased. There was an increase in aerobic capacityof muscles and a decrease in fast-twitch, low-oxida-tive bers. There was no change in slow-twitchbers. They suggested that a training program in-cluding swimming training is seen as being usefulfor improvement in performance capacity, given thatit can reduce locomotor diseases in young horses andallow for smooth progress in future training. 59 Horses use their forelimbs to regulate their lateral balance and their rear limbs function in propul-sion. 52The propulsive action of the rear limbs is exaggerated. During swimming, the equine back is lordotic. Because of the exaggerated rear-limb ac-tion and lordotic back, horses with rear-limb injuriesor back pain should not swim. Nankervis et al 60 also found that walking in high water causes cranialthoracic extension and thoracolumbar flexion com-pared with walking in water at hoof depth. Theyconcluded that this postural change should be con-sidered when designing rehabilitation programs forhorses with back and/or hindlimb pathology. There is an increased range of joint motion in both fore and hind limbs depending on water height.Joint angle in horses decreases as water approachesthe carpus or hock, indicating increased flexion ofthe joints. 61Once the level of the carpus or hock is reached, joint flexion and limb height tend to level out. This may be used to target specic joints andaid in re-establishment of joint range of motion afterjoint surgery. 61However, if maximal flexion of a joint is desired, then water level should be carpal/ tarsal level or higher. Water density is 12 times greater than air.45During aquatic therapy there is increased resistance to limb or body movement and increased energy costs compared with walking at similarspeeds on land due to this increased density. Thisprovides better muscle development and muscletone due to working against resistance and providesbetter balance of muscle groups working againstincreased resistance while maintaining a symmetri-cal gait. 62Underwater treadmill exercise signi - cantly improves the horses' postural stability.63 Safety is important when swimming or using an underwater treadmill. It is very important that thehandlers be thoroughly familiar with the equipmentand must be able to read the horse's temperament.The handler should be able to anticipate and correctproblems with the horse or equipment before theydevelop. Swimming pools should be constructed so that two handlers can easily walk 360\u00b0 around. Watershould be deep enough so that the horse cannottouch the bottom. A ramp entry system should beemployed that allows easy entry and exit from thepool. Sides should be sloped to prevent injury.The water becomes contaminated with dirt and fecesso a good ltration system is a necessity. Mosthorses are good swimmers but do require training.An introductory period is required with increasing AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 251IN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATIONtime intervals in the pool. Time is slowly increasedto a period of approximately 15 minutes. There hasbeen a protocol described using a swimming test todetermine the level of tness a horse has achievedfollowing conventional training. 64However, it is not very applicable for determining swimming protocols. There are two types of underwater treadmills: in ground and above ground. The in-ground type al-low for a greater amount of water to be used thusthere is greater buoyancy and greater resistance tomovement. Both are variable speeds that range0-15 mph. This is much lower than the high-speedtreadmill, which is capable of achieving speeds of45-50 mph. Horses require training on this equip-ment also. Both units require ltration and mosthave the ability to provide heated and unheatedwater. Acclimation to water treadmill exercise requires a minimum of 2 /H1100315-minute nonsedated acclimating runs. 65Sedation can be used to prevent horses panicking during the rst exposure but, thereafter, does not affect the time taken to acclimate. Water temperature should be adjusted to provide maximized comfort. For active exercise and swim-ming use 65-82\u00b0F. For less vigorous exercise 96-104\u00b0F is acceptable. The least-adverse physiologiceffects occur at 97\u00b0F. We keep our underwatertreadmill at a constant 82\u00b0F. Most facilities do not monitor any parameters ei- ther during or after a session, therefore, these rec-ommended protocols are empirical. Two easyparameters that can be measured include heart rateand blood lactate levels. 66Heart rate can be used to monitor the levels of stress that are being placed on the cardiovascular system. Maximum heartrate in the horse is approximately 200 bpm. Byusing a heart rate monitor you can set a target rateand then set a time to stay in the target range.Blood lactate is used to determine whether the horsehas progressed into the aerobic metabolism stage.This is a desired state to achieve adequate condition-ing. Respiratory rate can also be used but is not asreliable as heart rate. In addition, lameness eval-uation should be performed at weekly intervals todetermine whether any musculoskeletal problemhas arisen. Indications for aquatic therapy include rehabilita- tion after injury or surgery, tendon injuries, post-arthroscopic surgery, replacement for hand walking,joint stiffness, osteoarthritis, increase in muscledevelopment, encouraging symmetric gait and backdevelopment, cardiovascular conditioning, and re-conditioning after a lay-up. Contraindications for aquatic therapy include acute joint inflammation, skin infections, openwounds, upper limb lameness (swimming), backpain (swimming), acute myositis, cardiovascularcompromise, and respiratory disease. The following are variables that must be consid- ered when developing a protocol for an individualpatient. Of utmost importance is the disposition of the horse. There are going to be some horses thatmay never acclimate to aquatic therapy. In theseindividuals another therapeutic plan will need to bedeveloped.

When using an in-groundunit there are only two variables that can be ad-justed easily. They are speed and resis-tance. When using an above-ground underwatertreadmill, an additional variable would be waterheight. It is also important to note that the speedslisted are relative. Speed will vary from treadmillto treadmill and may not be indicative of actualground speed. They are used in the sample to showthat speed should be gradually increased from aslow walk up to a fast walk or trot. 12. Return to Work At some point the rehabilitation program will endand the horse must be returned to work if possible.It is important that return to work be performedgradually. Although the particular injury mayhave healed, the rest of the body may not be incondition. Table 1 is an example of a conservativeback-to-work plan. We always recommend at leasta 10-minute warm-up and cool-down period. It isimportant to determine whether the injury hashealed sufciently to allow for increased stress priorto progressing. In summary, there are many different options for treating reduced range of motion or for maintainingnormal joint motion after injury or surgery. Thetherapeutic protocols should be tailored to the indi-vidual. Response to therapy must be evaluated atdifferent times during therapy to determine prog- ress and whether a change in treatment is needed.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 255IN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATIONPractical Approach to the Rehabilitation of Soft Tissue Injuries in Sport Horses Alan Manning, MSC, DVM Author's address: e-mail: manningequine@sympatico.ca.\u00a9 2016 AAEP. 1. Introduction Due to the nature of the sport, soft-tissue injuries areinevitable. Injuries can be the result of poor confor-mation, the level of training and tness needed for thesport, and footing and weather-associated issues withthe eld of play. Age-associated injuries occur as a result of the wear and tear associated with the chronic repetitive natureof sport, especially dressage horses. Sometimes it isjust bad luck. There are many different ways to treatsoft-tissue injuries, including platelet rich plasma(PRP), stem cells, IRAP, shockwave, laser, and ultra-sound therapy. All have their pros and cons and thebest mode of treatment must be decided for each indi-vidual case. Different veterinarians will have differ-ent approaches to each type of injury. Once the initial treatments have been carried out and the clinician believes the horse is ready, themost critical part of the puzzle is getting the horsethat has been off work t again and back into the showring. This must be done in the best possible way toprevent re-injury of the initial issue and not causeother injuries. The time and patience required to dothis successfully is signicant. A detailed written rehabilitation protocol is a very important part of the puzzle as well, especially if therehabilitation is being done on the trainer/owner'sfarm. It must be precisely written out with times/ schedule, amount of exercise, and type and durationof exercise. Every case will be different, dependingon type and degree of injury and the individualhorse. You need to look at the client's expectationsas well, their nal goal and when the horse is ex-pected/anticipated to be ready to compete again(show season, etc.). There are very few, if any, pub- lished rehabilitation protocols readily available tothe public for equine soft-tissue injuries. The reha-bilitation plan for clients should also have a timeschedule for treatments (shockwave, PRP, etc.) andtiming for rechecks. It needs to be stated that this isa tentative schedule and it could well change depend-ing on rechecks and ultrasound ndings. The author believes that once the acute inflamma- tion is settled it is time to start the rehabilitationprocess; straight stall rest is not recommended inmost situations. Getting the horse moving is im-portant to help prevent scar tissue and promote theelasticity of tendons and ligaments, and to help pre-vent other secondary issues that arise from stall restsuch as gastrointestinal (GI) issues, etc. 2. Handwalking Handwalking is not always that simple. Horses onstall rest can be quite explosive at times. Walking 256 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATION NOTESwith a bridle on or a chain over the nose or in themouth can denitely be helpful. Sedation is some-times required. It takes a person with a lot of pa-tience and good horse handling for this to besuccessful. The footing is also important. It re-quires good, consistent footing. Footing that is toodeep can add stress to the injury. Sometimes it issafer and more prudent to walk the horse under tackdepending on the case and individual horse. In aclinic situation or rehabilitation facility it is difcultto exercise more than one horse at a time, given thatif one horse acts up, in most situations it will set offthe other horses. Initially start at 10 minutes aday and increase walking to 20-30 minutes, one totwo times a day depending on the individual caseand injury severity. It is important to add in dailyice treatment following exercise to help decreaseinflammation. 3. Starting to Walk Under Tack Depending on the case but usually the sooner youcan get started the better, and it is sometimes saferthan walking in hand. Draw lines and sedation aresometimes required. There should be no lateralwork, especially with suspensory ligament injury atrst. When ready to add stress to the injury youcan start to do some collected work and extendedstride walking. It can also be done by walking overpoles on the ground. You can then add raising thepoles off the ground as well when ready. The nextstep would be walking up and down gradual hills ifavailable to increase stress and stretching on thetendon/ligament. Other modalities, such as treadmills, work well in certain situations. There is the cost factor (rent) toconsider, but it does help save time, the horse walksat a consistent speed, the footing surface is consis-tent and the incline can be added when ready.You must be careful if the horse is not trained to usethe treadmill before the injury, given that they have a chance of injuring themselves and/or re-injury when getting acclimatized to the treadmill(take time to train them to it). There is some con-cern of the constant concussion when walking on thetreadmill. Walkers are another option. They are time sav- ing, decrease labor, and you can do more than onehorse at a time. Concerns are the need for goodfooting in the walker, and it needs to be maintained.Walkers are not recommended for collateral cofnjoint injuries due to the constant turning force onthe front feet. There is also risk of re-injury due tothe fact they can jump around, not as constrictedas treadmill. The author usually does not recom-mend the walker until further on in the rehabilita-tion process, obviously the larger circumference ofthe walker the better (less stress). The underwater treadmill can also be used to help increase cardio and muscle tness, as well as addgradual stress to injury; the problem is they areexpensive and horses must be trained to use them.They are time consuming to use and require main- tenance, and there is risk of injury if the horse hasnot used it prior to initial injury. A vibration plate is a good additional tool to the rehabilitation protocol. It allows increased muscle,tendon, and ligament tness without adding addi-tional stress to the injury, and also increases circu-lation to the lower extremities. The odd horse doesnot tolerate the time on it very well. 4. Support Bandage Quite often the question arises: Should you usesupport boots or bandages during the rehabilitationprocess? Polo wraps do add some protection, butnot a lot of support. Run-down bandages do addsome support as do the Professional Choice boots.If these are used, the author likes to wean the horsesoff them during the rehabilitation process and justuse protective sport boots. 5. Tentative Rehabilitation Schedule When the horse is ready to start back into work, thiscould be anywhere on average from 3-6 monthsafter the injury all depending on the severity of theinjury. First Month Back to Work Walking under tack, 20-30 minutes per week andincreasing by 5 minutes per week, up to 40-45minutes at the end of the month. After 2 weeksstart to walk over poles, and at 3 weeks start to dosome gradual hill work. This could be split into twosessions in 1 day. Routine ice treatment followingeach exercise is always recommended. A phonetimer works well to keep track of time. Second Month Back to Work Continue with walking regimen and start to trot5-10 minutes, split each direction, and increasing by5 minutes per week. Do not go deep into cornersand no tight circles or lateral work initially. Nearthe end of the month you can start to trot trails andsmall gradual hills. The walking should be splitbefore and after trotting, and the walking time willstart to decrease as the trotting time increases. Third Month Back to Work Continue walk and trot, start some trot circles at 20meters and raised trot poles and start canter work.Canter work can be done by time or number ofrounds of the exercise arena, whichever is easier tokeep track of. Start gradual and increase accord-ingly. No tight circles at the canter initially. Af-ter cantering for 1 month the horse can usually goback to full work and start to jump or begin moreadvanced dressage work. 6. Follow-up It is very important to reassess the injury with alameness examination and ultrasounds at regularintervals, every 4-6 weeks, and to make AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 257IN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATIONincreased stress on the area has not had a negativeeffect on the healing process and the ber pattern isimproving. The rehabilitation protocol may need tobe adjusted depending on the ndings. The authornds that it is benecial to do these evaluationsbefore the horse steps up to the next level of reha-bilitation, i.e., before trot, and again before canter. 7. Turnout The other critical decision is when to start turnout.Once again, it is case- and individual-horse depen-dent. Small rehabilitation paddocks and smallround pens are a great asset. Round pens cansometimes be increased in size as time goes. Somehorses may need to be sedated at rst. Feeding hayat turnout helps to keep horses occupied as well.The author feels at the earliest, turnout is appropri-ate 3 months following the injury but in some casesnot until the horse starts cantering. The footing isvery important and should not be too deep. Stonedust works well. Small outdoor paddocks (12 /H1100312 ft) with rubber mats are good initially and can beused much sooner after injury. When the horse is ready to start jumping, usually after cantering for a month or more, and has beenwalking and trotting over poles on the ground andraised, the author usually recommends grid work.Trot into it and ensure that there is normal distanceset for the individual horse's stride. Obviously,start small and increase the size over time. (Thereis less stress on the injury in a horse at a normaltakeoff distance and this is more likely to occur in atrot-in grid). Once the horse has been working in agrid for 2-3 weeks, you can start to use individualfences. For the dressage horse, once he is ready you can start to do lateral work and more collected work.Obviously, the more advanced movements such aspassage, piaffe, and pirouette are more stressful ondifferent parts of the horse's body and need to beadded into work accordingly. When soft tissue is healing, the new tissue needs to be educated on its job. This occurs during therehabilitation process and has to be done gradually.Be careful not to overdo this during the rehabilita- tion process and cause re-injury. During the reha-bilitation process, the elasticity and strength of theneighboring tissue above and below the injury needsto be increased. Also, given that the new tissuedoes not seem to have the same elastic properties asthe original tissue, the author believes that the over-all process of getting a soft-tissue injury back tocompetition successfully involves 25% treatmentand 75% rehabilitation process. You cannot leavethe client on their own to rehabilitate. When a horse gets reinjured during the rehabili- tation process it can be very frustrating. Depend-ing on the degree of injury, sometimes therehabilitation process must be backed up. If theinjury is signicant, have a discussion withthe owner and/or trainer to decide whether the horseneeds a new occupation that is less stress-ful. Sometimes when the horse reinjures, it is bestto just do long-term paddock turnout for 6-12months and reassess. 8. Points to Take Home for Successful Rehabilitation Need an accurate diagnosis Have a clear, concise written treatment and rehabilitation protocol (tentative) for the owner/trainer/groom Every case is different: approach it that way Do not need all the fancy rehabilitation equip- ment to do a good job and be successful Ice is your friend Walking under tack is very benecial initially Regular evaluations of the injury and its prog- ress are essential for success Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Turner, DVM, MS, DACVS, DACVSMR Muscle injuries occur in horses to various degrees. The injuries can cause anything from poor perfor-mance to lameness. However, diagnosis may be difcult as the pain may only manifest itself duringperformance and may not be palpable. Infrared thermal imaging can be useful to determine the regionof injury. Rehabilitation is based on healing, improving flexibility and muscle condition, strengtheningthe injured muscle, and then slowly returning to full activity.

Introduction Muscle pain and injury as a cause of lameness andpoor performance in the horse is poorly recognized.In human athletes, muscle fatigue, muscle stiffness,muscle soreness, and muscle tears are well recog-nized and considered among the most common athletic injuries. In horses, muscle injuries are un-commonly documented as a cause of lameness.Fibrotic myopathy, stringhalt, and ruptured pero-neus tertius are among the only muscle injuriesreported in the horse. 1These lamenesses are usu- ally characterized by the resultant gait abnormali-ties. Other muscle problems such as stress flutter, post- exercise fatigue, are as specicphysiologic disturbances. 2Muscle injuries fre- quently cause lameness in human athletes and rac-ing greyhounds. Similar injuries therefore wouldbe expected in the horse. Factors that predispose to muscle strains include cold temperatures or impaired circulation to themuscle, local or generalized muscle fatigue, poor orinsufcient training, and insufcient warmup. 1Cold has been shown to increase muscle tension and cause circulatory disturbances. This phenomenoncauses earlier muscle fatigue, which can lead touncoordinated muscle movement and strain. Fa-tigue predisposes to injury in two ways. First, muscle fatigue is a manifestation of general fatigue,which affects those groups that are maximallyloaded. As muscles fatigue, they decrease in per-formance and elasticity, thus enhancing the likeli-hood of strain. Further general fatigue results incentral nervous system incoordination of movementand predisposition to strain. Therefore, trainingmust be designed to progressively increase theworkload to develop the muscle groups, and to de-crease early fatigue and permit rapid restoration ofmuscle function after exertion. Insufcient war-mup of muscles prior to exercise results in decreasedcirculation and lowered capacity to eliminate musclewaste products. Both these factors decrease themuscles' ability to sustain maximal performance. The equine athlete is exposed to these predispos- ing factors on a routine basis. Hypothetically, ifthe horse suffers muscle strains, these injurieswould most likely be manifested as lameness. Thedifculty for the veterinarian is the positive /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 259IN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATION NOTESsis of these injuries. In human medicine, the ath-lete's description of the pain location is often thesingle most important factor in diagnosis. Thisdiagnostic aid is obviously lacking in veterinarymedicine. Many of these cases probably go undiag-nosed in equine medicine because they cannot beconrmed by commonly used diagnostic methods such as radiographs and nerve blocks. As such,these lamenesses are most likely treated empiricallywith various combinations of rest, analgesics, andanti-inflammatory agents. Some veterinarians have recognized muscle injury as a cause of poor performance. Sites in the fore-limb include the biceps brachii, and muscle. spasms, and pain have been recognizedin the thoracolumbar region. In fact, localizedmuscle soreness is readily induced by a poorly ttingsaddle or poorly balanced rider. 2. Diagnosis As previously stated, the diagnosis of muscle injuryin horses can be difcult. It is important to deter-mine whether there was a history of a fall or othertrauma, the duration of clinical signs, the presenceof swelling, and whether lameness or poor perfor-mance has been documented. The detection of muscle swelling or muscle loss as a result of brosis, chronic injury, or atrophy can beproblematic. The horse should stand square, bear-ing weight evenly on all four limbs and with thehead straight. The horse can then be assessed vi-sually and the muscles palpated looking for brosis,tension or spasms, defects, or pain. Acute muscletears may not be palpable because the defects be-come lled with hemorrhage, inflammatory debris,exudate, and edema. However, careful palpationcan detect most supercial muscle injuries butdeeper muscle injury is more difcult to identify. Serum muscle enzyme concentration assessment, while very useful in the diagnosis of systemic muscledisease such as rhabdomyolysis, is of limited use inthe diagnosis of muscle soreness or muscle tears. In humans, part of the assessment includes eval- uation of joint range of motion associated with theinvolved muscle as well as strength assessment.There are no data available for horses but this au-thor believes this would be valuable information,especially for the assessment of rehabilitation. Ultrasonography can be very valuable in the as- sessment of the injury site. The most difcult as-pect in horses may be the detection of the injury.The author has found infrared thermal imaging tobe valuable in locating the area of injury. Thermography is the pictorial representation of the surface temperature of an object. 3It is a non - invasive technique that measures emitted heat.A medical thermogram represents the surface tem-peratures of skin making thermography useful for the detection of inflammation. Although thermo-graphic images measure only skin temperature,they also reflect alterations in circulation of deepertissues. This ability to noninvasively assess in- flammatory change makes thermography an idealimaging tool to aid in the diagnosis of certain lame-ness conditions in the horse. Thermographic muscle lesions have been de- scribed in horses. 1,3These lesions were dened as those with a 1\u00b0C disparity in temperature greater than 25% of symmetrical body areas. These dispar-ities could consist of an increase or a decrease intemperature. Increases in temperature were sug-gestive of vasodilation associated with inflamma-tion, whereas decreases in temperature were indicative of chronic scarring and reduced circula-tion or local edema, swelling, and vascular stasisdue to severe inflammation. On the basis of thethermographic and clinical ndings, the horse's in-jury could be further categorized as one threetypes of muscle injury: cranial thigh, caudal thigh,and croup region. cranial-thigh muscle inju-ries included injuries which the thermographicabnormality was the quadriceps musculature(Fig. 1); the thosecases in primary thermographic abnor-malities were located over the caudal thigh from thesacrum to the gaskin (Figs. 2 and 3); and the croupmyopathy (Fig. 4) included cases shown thermo-graphically to have inflammation involving the cau-dal loin, sacroiliac region, and hip. Since thatreport, muscle injuries have been diagnosed thermo-graphically in the foreleg as well but these havebeen limited to muscles of the shoulder region. 3 According to some manuscripts, once the area is located, ultrasonography was used to characterizethe nature of the injury. 4In each case, ultrasonog - raphy of the region of the \"hot spot\" revealed disrup-tion of normal muscle bers and varying sizes ofhypoechogenicity typical of hemorrhage. A secondlesion noted sonographically was a hyperechogenic-ity thought to be early brosis and a disruption ofnormal muscle/tendon patterns with focal hypoecho- Fig. 1.

One case was reported in whichbiopsy of the thermographic \"hot spot\" revealed fas-ciitis of the fascia surrounding the muscle. 4 3. Rehabilitation In humans, the goal of rehabilitating muscle injuriesis based on three goals: 1) improving flexibility andmuscle condition, 2) strengthening, and 3) return to full activity. 5Improving flexibility and muscle con - dition can be performed using a number of differenttechniques. Stretching exercises may be done fromday 1 as long as they can be done without pain.If pain is felt, stop and wait. Stretching should bedone regularly, at least three times a day in theearly stages of rehabilitation. Horses stretch bestby walking in a long and low frame. Stretching canbe performed before exercise, to help the muscleswarm up, loosen up, and relax; movements shouldnot be forced and methods limited to what is toler-ated. Carrot stretches are an excellent method.Work is limited to what the horse can do withoutpain. Likewise, intensity is limited to the gaits thehorse can perform without pain. But if the horse iscapable, ground poles or cavalettis can stretch thehorse as can bending exercises. After exercise, onecan take advantage of warmed-up muscle and forcethe stretch more. Sports massage techniques are exceptionally use- ful after the initial acute stage (usually 48 h). 5 This will relax the muscle, loosen and help preventscar tissue formation, and encourage blood flow andhealing of the muscle. Massage has many tech-niques, generally, massage movements should gowith the lay of the hair (following the direction of themuscle bers), sometimes transversely but nevercounter. Counter movements may induce musclespasms. Horses, because of their size, may be difcult to stretch or massage, that is where therapeutic de-vices have been helpful. Therapeutic sound andelectrical stimulation are among the most commondevices used. Therapeutic sound devices can be di-vided into therapeutic ultrasound and shockwave.Therapeutic ultrasound is a method of stimulatingtissue beneath the skin's surface using very highfrequency sound waves, between 800,000 and2,000,000 Hz, which cannot be heard by humans. 6 Ultrasound is applied using a transducer or appli-cator that is in direct contact with the patient's skin.Gel is used on all surfaces of the head to reducefriction and assist transmission of the ultrasonicwaves. There are three primary benets to ultra-sound. The rst is the speeding up of the healingprocess from the increase in blood flow in the treatedarea. The second is the decrease in pain from thereduction of swelling and edema. The third is thegentle massage of muscles, tendons, or ligaments inthe treated area because no strain is added and anyscar tissue is softened. These three benets areachieved by two main effects of therapeutic ultra-sound. The two types of effects are thermal andnonthermal effects. Thermal effects are due to theabsorption of the sound waves. Nonthermal effectsare from cavitation, microstreaming, acousticstreaming. 6The thermal been docu in horses, the nonthermal effects have not.7 Extracorporeal shockwave therapy are abrupt, high-amplitude pulses of mechanical energy, similar Fig. 2.

The left side iswarmer, the white encircled area represents the gluteal mus-cle. Note the most heat is at the origin of the gluteal and at itsinsertion on the greater an electromagnetic coilor a spark in water. 8\"Extracorporeal\" means that the shockwaves are generated externally to the body and transmitted from a pad through the skin. Withextracorporeal shockwave therapy, reduced pain,and faster healing are reported. The exact physio-logical mechanisms at this stage are poorly under-stood, but it seems that the cells undergomicrotrauma, which promotes the inflammatory andcatabolic processes that are associated with remov-ing damaged matrix constituents and stimulateswound-healing mechanisms. 8 Electrical stimulation or electrical muscle stim- ulation, also known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation, is the elicitation of muscle contractionusing electric impulses. Electrical muscle stimula-tion has received increasing attention in the last fewyears because of its potential to serve as a strength-training tool for healthy subjects and athletes, arehabilitation and preventive tool for partially ortotally immobilized patients, a testing tool for eval-uating the neural and/or muscular function in vivo,and a post-exercise recovery tool for athletes. 9The impulses are generated by a device and deliveredthrough electrodes on the skin in direct proximity tothe muscles to be stimulated. The impulses mimicthe action potential coming from the central nervoussystem, causing the muscles to contract. The elec-trodes are generally pads that adhere to the skin.Electrical stimulation is reported to have many ben-ets: 1) pain relief caused by decreased spasticityof muscle, 2) improved range of motion caused byreduced muscle tension, 3) reduction in swellingscaused by injury, 4) reduction of scar tissue duringhealing, 5) re-education of muscle function to pre-vent further injury, 6) strengthening of musclesand tendons, 7) reversal of muscle wasting, and 8)decreased rehabilitation time after injury andsurgery. 9 There are different types of electrical stimulation. Among the most common are transcutaneous elec-trical nerve stimulation (TENS), which is the use ofelectric current devices to assist with short-term orlong-term pain relief. 9TENS units are designed to produce analgesia of pain and reduce responses of dorsal-horn neurons to painful stimuli. The TENSsystems activate the descending inhibitory pathwayfrom the brainstem to the spinal cord. However,the means of reducing pain varies between the spe-cic types of systems and includes activating spinalcord gating mechanisms, endogenous opiates, sero-tonin receptors, noradrenaline receptors, and mus-carinic receptors. Regardless, the electrical signalscause muscles under the electrodes to contract. Another type of electrical stimulation is functional electrical stimulation (FES). 9FES is the applica - tion of an electrical current through surface elec-trodes to produce a controlled muscular contraction.A microprocessor generates a train of impulses thatimitate the neural signals that pass between thespinal cord and the peripheral nerves in healthymuscle, producing a muscle contraction. FES is utilized to disturb spastic hyperexcitability, return-ing the muscle to its balanced contraction and relax-ation phases, therefore reducing pain. FES devicesare designed to stimulate motor nerves but periph-eral nerves are also stimulated when motor nervesare activated, so there is a combined effect. FESprovides a means to mobilize muscle, tendon, andthe associated ligaments through the generation ofcontrolled muscular contractions. FES can be usedfor stimulation of deeper tissues; and therefore, theattainment of strong muscular contractions is pos-sible. Stronger contractions have been shown to bemore effective in reducing pain, and the benetshave proven to be longer lasting than other forms ofelectrical stimulation. Pulsed electromagnetic eld therapy is a repara- tive technique most commonly used in the eld oforthopedics for the treatment of non-union has been used more for healingother types of connective tissue including muscle.Regardless of the modality, to achieve the goal ofimproving flexibility and muscle condition, it is theauthor's opinion that the horse must remain in atleast low-intensity exercise. Strengthening the muscles is important to avoid re-injuring the muscles. It is especially importantto strengthen the muscles in the same direction/waythat they were injured. Light strengthening exer-cises can begin after the acute stage or as soon aspain allows. If they are painful then stop and wait.Horses gain strength by flexion (ground poles andcavalettis), through transitions of gait, stress (deepfooting, hill work, etc.) and lateral work (may bemost difcult, especially for inner-thigh injuries).For humans, there are protocols for strengtheningspecic muscle groups, but these protocols do notexist for horses at this time. There is work ongoingusing therapeutic banding, treadmills, and under-water treadmills, but the results are not complete.Most build strength through controlled exercise. Strengthening exercises may be done on a daily basis in the early stages of rehabilitation and asintensity increases and full activity is regained theymay be reduced to three times a week. Stretchingexercises should be continued throughout thestrengthening process both before and after astrengthening session. The return to full activity should be a gradual process. Do not go straight back into regular workbut build up gradually from slow trotting. Whenthe horse can slow trot for 20 minutes without prob-lems, gradually build up speed. Extended trotshould lead to canter and canter to gallop, graduallyincreasing to what is needed for competition. Only when the horse can comfortably manage spe- cic training should they be returned to full trainingor competition. As training is commenced, mas-sage therapy, acupuncture, and in some cases chiro- 262 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATIONpractic adjustments can help the horse recover.But for the long term the author has found thataltering the exercise program can be most benecialand conditioning is of utmost importance. Thework schedule should be a progressive schedule thatwill take 60-90 days, and ideal work schedule is 6days per week. Initially, most exercise should bewarmup (stretching). This will consist of walkingin a long and low frame until the rider can feel thehips moving equally and a normal overstride behind.Once achieved, the horse should be worked overground poles for 15-20 minutes. When groundpoles become easy, change to cavalettis. Exercisefor at least 1 hour. As work becomes easier thenslow trot can be added. Work in a long and lowframe (extended frame). This will help stretch thehorse's top line and any tight muscles there. Oncethe horse can slow trot consistently for 15 minutes,then the intensity (speed) can increase. When 15minutes of extended trot is achieved, the canter canbe added. Work the horse for at least an hour eachday. Lateral work should not be added until thehorse can consistently canter for 15 minutes withoutproblems. In addition, vigorous massage of the tight muscles in the horse's back, croup, and thigh before and afterexercising the horse may be helpful. Post-exercisebody wash with liniments, intense massage, andtherapeutic ultrasound treatments may be helpfulin alleviating soreness. Attention to the horse'strimming and shoeing should concentrate on hoofbalance (especially rearlimb sole angle) and trac-tion. During this retraining period, infrared ther-mal imaging can be used to assess muscle stress toinsure that too much stress is not applied. Stresswould be seen as abnormal heat in the skin overly-ing the muscle. 4. Discussion The most common cause of muscle inflammation ismuscle strain. 1A classication of rst-, second-, or third-degree strain injuries, described in human athletes, has been applied to horses. In one study,areas of hindlimb muscle injuries in horses wereidentied. One, the croup myopathy, involved in-flammation over the the muscle, gluteus medius muscle, gluteusprofundus muscle, the insertions on the greater trochanter and asso-ciated fascia. The analogous regions in man wouldconstitute the lower back and hip. The second, thecaudal thigh myopathy, involved the areas over thebiceps femoris muscle, the semitendinosus muscle,the semimembranosus muscle, and their origins andtheir upper limb insertions and musculotendinousattachments. This would be analogous to a ham-string injury. The third, the cranial-thigh injury,constitutes damage and tensorfascia lata. tendon lameness has been described in the horse; the major clinical sign was pain aroundthe greater trochanter. 11There have been numer - ous reports of the effect of lumbar and sacroiliacpain leading to lameness. For the purposes of thispaper, the author has chosen to place these rear endmuscle issues into one of these three general cate-gories because palpation and thermography cannotspecically identify the structures involved. Ther-mography only reflects problems of deeper tissues,(i.e., it suggests the area of disease but does notreveal any information as to the nature of the or-ganic damage). The grouping of these problems to-gether is because of their close anatomical location and similar effects on the horse's gait. Muscle injuries in the horse have been described as ranging from loss of performance to pain createdby a particular movement to overt lameness. 11 The wide range of degree of lameness reported in thehorse supports this observation. In one report, thecaudal thigh myopathy was more likely to causesevere lameness than the cranial thigh or croupmuscle injuries. 1The caudal thigh muscles may be more likely to tear, and tears in this group of mus- cles have been documented. Fibrotic myopathy, acondition of the horse that involves the semitendi-nosus muscle and occasionally the semimembrano-sus and biceps femoris muscles, is thought tooriginate from trauma to the musculotendinousjunction. Another possible reason for the greaterpain associated with these injuries is the complexactions of these muscles. This group of musclesextends the hip, flexes the stifle, and extends thehock. Because of the action of the horse's reciprocalapparatus, all three functions cannot occur simulta-neously unless muscle contraction is coordinated.Hypothetically, if an injury occurred, the horseshould have pain each time the leg was extendedbecause stifle extension would exert a direct oppos-ing force on the caudal thigh muscles as they con-tract for hip and hock extension. Forelimb muscleinjuries occur but they have been poorly reported. 3 Pain on palpation is probably the single most im- portant physical evidence of injury. Pain elicitedby palpation should be repeatable, but care shouldbe taken not to overdo palpation which may result inthe horse \"guarding\" the injury and thus not re-sponding. The author has found that rm pressurewas more reliable than squeezing muscle masseswhen trying to differentiate pain from simple annoy-ance. Stress points have been described that helppoint to lesions of these muscles. Stress points arethe points where the greatest stress produced bymovement occurs. However, palpable pain is notreliable with regard to muscle strains and tears. Thermography can be used in these cases as a diagnostic tool. 3In each case, information from thermography is important in determining the re- gion of injury. Thermography has been shown to bea practical aid in the clinical evaluation of lameness.This modality specically increases the accuracy ofdiagnosis by conrming inflammation in palpablysore areas and by showing the area to concentrate AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 Clinically, thermography also im-proves therapy. Once the area of inflammation isdetermined, physical therapy can be applied directlyto that area. In this fashion, therapeutic ultra-sound, massage, or other treatment is applied morespecically to the inflamed area. Further, ther-mography can be used to monitor the resolution ofthe inflammatory process and possible recurrenceduring the rehabilitation. 5. Conclusion Muscle injuries occur in horses to various degrees.The injuries can cause anything from poor perfor-mance to lameness. However, diagnosis may bedifcult as the pain may only manifest itself dur-ing performance and may not be palpable. Infra-red thermal imaging can be useful to determinethe region of injury. Rehabilitation is based onhealing, improving flexibility and muscle condi-tion, strengthening the injured muscle, and thenslowly returning to full activity.

Therefore, to maximize fullpotential of athletic performance, physical thera-pists and veterinarians who specialize in equinesports medicine must address pertinent musculosk-eletal, neuromuscular, and biomechanical faultsthat might impede how the rider affects the horseand the horse affects the rider. The symbiotic re-lationship between horse and rider has become atopic of special interest in recent literature, andrecognized as an important entity in need of morein-depth research. 1-5 Experts in the eld of equestrian sports have be- gun to identify a variety of dysfunctional and evenpathologic conditions resulting from disharmonybetween horse and rider. 2,6For example, specic exercises designed for core stabilization andstrengthening for both horses and riders havebeen shown to improve trunk balance, abdominalstrength, proprioception, and pelvic symmetry, re- sulting in increased support of the spine and ex-tremities during dynamic activities. 7,8In contrast,weak core muscles and lack of dynamic stability result in postural imbalances and abnormal biome-chanics that may in turn lead to low back or hip painin riders and lumbar or sacroiliac dysfunction inhorses. Over time, imbalanced muscle strengthand flexibility will lead to chronic conditions of de-creased joint mobility, impaired active and passiverange of motion in the spine and extremities, andultimately, a decrease in sport performance. Thefollowing analogies will help clarify these points. 2. Symbiotic Relationship In equestrian athletes, acute muscular back or pel-vic pain left untreated will cause the rider to posi-tion himself unbalanced in the saddle. 8An unbalanced rider will subsequently create unequalseat pressures which, by nature of interplay, willdirectly transfer as uneven forces to the spine andrib cage of the horse. 9A rider that possesses un- even saddle pressures will result in a horse needingto compensate in response to the abnormal and oftenuncomfortable forces placed on its spine. If the rid-er's positional faults are neglected for long periods oftime anatomic adaptations in the horse will occur,leading to potential restrictions in costovertebraland zygaphophyseal joint mobility, ultimately lead-ing to decreased sport performance. Over time, ahorse or rider that continues to perform without AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 265IN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATION NOTEScorrecting muscle imbalances will be prone to ac-quiring acute or chronic injuries secondary to a cas-cade of compensatory mechanisms. For example, a competitive showjumping horse experiencing pain in the lower spine may compen-sate during takeoff by overusing muscles in the hindlimbs. Over a period of time, soft tissues subjectedto overuse will eventually break down, leading topotentially debilitating muscle trigger points, ten-donitis or tendonosis, acute tearing of muscle andligamentous tissues, and bony stress fractures.If injuries are severe enough, the equine athlete maybe eliminated from competition for a period of timeor indenitely. Another example illustrating the importance of correcting muscle and soft tissue imbalances to re-store harmony between horse and rider may betaken from the equine perspective. Take a casewhere a competitive showjumping horse has devel-oped degenerative changes in the fourth throughseventh cervical vertebrae. The bony changes mayor may not be painful to the horse, however, theywill most likely have created decreased segmentalmobility in the zygapophyseal joint capsules result-ing in decreased cervical sidebending range of mo-tion. The loss of cervical motion will affect thehorse's ability to turn either right or left when show-ing. This will subsequently alter the optimal dy-namic balance between horse and rider and result ina decrease in performance. The rider may describethe problem as, \"My horse does not turn to the rightor left very well,\" but in fact the horse has a verytreatable condition from a physical therapy para-digm of clinical reasoning. A physical therapist will clinically address soft tissue and joint restrictions in the equine cervicalspine utilizing a similar line of clinical reasoning asapplied to humans; by incorporating skilled manualtherapy and adjunctive techniques to treat myofas-cial and connective tissue dysfunction and restorenormal joint arthro and osteokinematics. 10In the case of degeneration in the cervical spine, a thera- pist will treat the equine client through use of man-ual therapy, aided by appropriate physical agents toaddress muscle spasms, trigger points, and soft tis-sue restrictions. Successful clinical outcomes willbe assessed by increased passive and active cervicalside-bending range of motion and improved sportperformance. Rider feedback will indicate a notice-able increase in cervical spinal mobility in the horseduring performance and a sense of greater efciencywith dynamic trunk balance in saddle while show-ing. Finally, another interesting phenomenon oc-curring in both humans and horses relates to howeven minor physical ailments or lesions in joints orsoft tissues, if left untreated, may negatively impactmusculoskeletal mechanics and sport performance.For example, with human athletes, ligament sprainsor tendon strains that fail to heal properly over timemay result in compensatory biomechanical faultsand joint hypomobility ultimately leading to a reduc-tion in sport performance. A similar cascade of events occurs in horses that experience improperlyhealed injuries as described by the followingexample. In an equine athlete, a low grade or sub-clinical case of soft tissue injury or dysfunction to either thesupercial or deep digital flexor tendons in the hindlimb may clinically manifest as compensatory bio-mechanical faults in proximal limb function, sacro-iliac joint movement, and thoracolumbar segmentalmobility. The secondary faults may in turn resultin painful palpation to soft tissues, asymmetricalconformation in the extremities and spine, observ-able lameness that dees denitive diagnoses, anddiminished sport performance. The focus of carefor the equine client exhibiting compensatory biome-chanical faults is to appropriately identify and treatboth primary and secondary sources of injury andultimately restore normal tissue function to prolonga successful athletic career. The fundamental goalfor physical therapists and veterinarians practicingsports medicine is to maximize athletic potentialand performance. This is accomplished by restor-ing and elevating the highest level of anatomic andbiomechanical function physically capable from bothhorse and rider in addition to addressing overallbody conditioning utilizing a holistic approach tocare. In more severe cases of injury, however, ei-ther the rider or horse may require controlled restfrom competition long enough to adequately rehabil-itate injuries in need of greater periods of recovery. 3. Physical Rehabilitation In situations in which an injury to an equine athleticmay require temporary cessation from sport, theanimal will benet from a combination of both vet-erinary care and a period of skilled physical therapyintervention. The goals of therapy will be to elim-inate signs and symptoms of pain and swelling, re-store normal function of involved tissues, andproperly recondition the involved athlete for a re-turn to sport. In contrast, a complete lack of imple-mentation or inadequately controlled rehabilitationmay lead to a vicious cycle of repetitive injuries orchronic pain, which in turn may preclude an athletefrom returning to sport altogether. A complete cycle of injury and recovery will occur when damaged tissues are subjected to appropriateinternal and external environments that supportthe healing process. To illustrate, assume a com-petitive equine athlete sustains an acute micro-tear-ing of the deep digital flexor tendon on the hindlimb.A typical sequence of healing would include an in-flammatory stage, followed by cellular proliferation,and nally remodeling and maturation of the ten-don. 11Successful healing will occur if the cellular and microvascular environments remain healthy, and if the horse is properly cared for through use ofactive rest, proper nutrition, and therapeuticallyprescribed exercise to restore tissue homeostasisand enable successful return to sport. 266 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMENESS REHABILITATIONIf, however, the deep digital flexor tendon does not heal properly, or the horse returns to sport prior tocomplete maturation of tissues, then re-injury of thetendon will most likely occur, along with additionalcompensatory sequela such as overactivation of thehamstrings or lumbar paraspinal muscles. If thisreaction occurs, the horse may fall into a viciouscycle of pain, spasm, and dysfunction of involvedtissues causing secondary lower back pain cascadinginto additional biomechanical faults in gait, andjumping ability. Intervention with this scenario bya qualied physical therapist, however, will helpbreak the pain/spasm cycle and restore injured tis-sues back to a state of normal function. The primary emphasis of a structured physical therapy plan of care for any condition is to restorenormal anatomic, physiologic, and biomechanicalfunction, and return the athlete to all desired activ-ities, including sport performance. To accomplishthese goals, a physical therapist will create an indi-vidualized treatment plan based on a thorough eval-uation and selection of appropriate interventions.Interventions may include such things as specicmanual therapy techniques to restore normal func-tion in joint and soft tissues, physical agent modal-ities to support the healing process, and tailoredtherapeutic exercises to address muscle, cardiovas-cular, and respiratory conditioning. Failure toachieve these goals during rehabilitation will resultin inadequately healed tissues, lack of proper condi-tioning, and ultimately reduced sport performance,or possibly a complete end to an athletic career. 4. Equine Performance Enhancement One of the key elements for any athlete to performat peak levels in sporting activities is to be inabsolute top condition both physically and psycho-logically. These factors are the same for bothhuman and equine competitors. In human med-icine, a large body of research exists demonstrat-ing the importance of proper physical conditioningand how various tness parameters relate to sportperformance. 12-18This is true for athletes com - peting in all sports that require strength, power,agility, aerobic, and anaerobic capacities. In theworld of equine, the amount of research on athleticperformance, especially related to sport specicdemands, is signicantly less than in human med-icine. However, the equine athlete experiencesmany of the same physical challenges as humancounterparts. For example, common issues en-countered when working with elite performinghorses include damage to ligamentous and muscletissues; loss of or altered proprioception, vertebralhypo or hypermobility; decreased joint range ofmotion; loss of strength, decreased soft tissue flex-ibility; core weakness; asymmetries such as mus-cle imbalances in the pelvic, lumbar, and cervicalregions; and overall aerobic and anaerobicdeconditioning. 19-22A few experts have addressed some of the more common issues encountered in horse performance,but overall, the science of sports medicine speci-cally related to the equine athlete remains in itsinfancy in both scope and depth. Studies have beenconducted on basic equine physiology with refer-ences to athletic performance, but data related tosport-specic demands has primarily centered onbiomechanics, core strengthening exercises, founda-tional stretching techniques to enhance overall mo-bility, and parameters to improve speed andendurance. Studies that directly correlate how al-tering biophysical parameters in a horse specicallyaffect sport performance in relation to outcomesis signicantly lacking. An even greater void ofknowledge exists, however, regarding the best wayto maximize training and conditioning programs forequine athletes based on sport-specic demands. 5. Equine Training and Conditioning To address the topic of equine conditioning for sportperformance, one of the authors of this paper distrib-uted a survey to professional trainers involved withGrand Prix riders in the United States, many at theOlympic and World Cup level. 23A total of 50 profes - sional trainers were asked a series of questions relatedto how they personally trained elite show-jumpinghorses in preparation for competitions. Severalthemes emerged from the questionnaire demonstrat-ing both consistent and inconsistent ndings. In gen-eral, trainers agreed on the following factors: theearliest age to start jumping a horse is 4 years; theaverage age to enter a horse into a Grand Prix event is8-9 years; application of ice on the lower extremitiespost jumping; and attitudinal changes in horses do infact occur with overtraining. Items found to be inconsistent based on data from surveying trainers included the following: noagreement on weekly training schedules; a lack ofspecic exercises used for conditioning horses; nodescriptions of generalized tness programs to useyear round; no agreement on standardized recoveryperiods post competition; a lack of sport-specic ex-ercises related to aerobic/interval/gymnastic/speedwork/roll backs or lateral training; and no standard-ization of the number of classes per week allowed forthe horse nor the amount of jumps allowed when ahorse is not competing. In addition, other ndingsfrom the survey data are worth noting. Horse trainers expressed no knowledge of the sci- ence underlying formalized training programs, andthe concept of periodization as a scientic way tocondition a horse both on and off season was absentfrom all responses. The physiological basis ofequine delayed-onset muscle soreness post-exercisewas also never mentioned in the survey. Exerciserecovery time and parameters indicating how train-ers worked horses during nonjumping days duringcompetition were other topics completely lackingfrom data analysis.

Therefore,results from the trainer survey call to question whyconcepts that are so commonly understood and suc-cessfully used in training elite human athletes havenot been formally researched and applied in eliteequine athletes. In conclusion, the overarching theme from the survey of 50 professional trainers regarding equineconditioning programs was the clear lack of consis-tency between training regimens and omission ofunderstanding for basic physiological principles oftness and conditioning. Although additional dataare necessary to extrapolate statistical conclusions,themes from the current survey suggest a need forscientic evaluation of what constitutes best prac-tice by way of tness training and conditioning forthe equine athlete. 6. Practical Applications The quantity and quality of research supportingsports medicine in human athletes should and canbe adapted and applied in similar fashion to theequine athlete. Basic principles and concepts ofphysical conditioning, tness, and rehabilitationhave already found success in canine sports medi-cine leaving no reason as to why they cannot beapplied equally as well to the equine species. 24 Physical therapists and veterinarians who special-ize in exercise physiology, strength and condition-ing, and enhancement of sport performance have theknowledge and skills to push the limits of equinesport performance to even greater heights thanwhat currently exists today. Research into evidence-based principles of exer- cise physiology including aerobic and anaerobicconditioning, muscle mutability, soft tissue extensi-bility, and advances in the science of physical andneurologic rehabilitation has created exciting oppor-tunities for individuals involved in training andcompeting equine athletes. Although the future ofequine sports medicine looks bright, clinical practicerequires validation by scientic methods that sup-port outcomes-based protocols for conditioning andtraining regimes both on and off season. Currentexperts in equine studies have produced an impres-sive body of knowledge related to exercise physiol-ogy and sport conditioning providing a solidfoundation to aid future scholars and clinicians. 25-27 If existing knowledge can be successfully integratedinto new paradigms of scientic inquiry the outcomewill result in a class of equine athletes with thecapacity to exceed never-before-imagined accom-plishments in physical performance. 7. Conclusion The symbiotic interplay between horse and rider inall equine sports is paramount and must not beoverlooked by experts in the eld. Factors includ-ing physical tness, aerobic and anaerobic condi-tioning, strength, flexibility, proprioception, and other complex biomechanical factors that affect therider will also affect the horse, and visa versa.Both human and horse need to be conditioned andfunctioning at peak performance to truly display thefull potential of athletic achievement in all eques-trian sports, especially those requiring extremetests of strength, power, endurance, and agility.

Introduction As equine veterinary professionals, we are oftencalled upon to be educators. Our clients look to usas partners who guide them on a regular basis tomake informed decisions about the care of theirequine companions. Our colleagues frequentlyseek our expertise, advice, and mentorship. Ourcommunities respect us as resourceful leaders whenit comes to concerns such as public health or animalwelfare. We are well practiced at the art of inform-ing. Making a career transition into the academicdomain may provide a highly suitable t for thosewho have talent and passion for teaching. There are numerous opportunities to nd a path- way into your role as an educator. Some veterinar-ians are intensely drawn to the system of highereducation and perhaps have intentionally never leftthe university environment. Advanced degrees,specialty training and strong publication records,are often rewarded with tenured status as faculty inour professional teaching programs. However,there are many other options to consider for theequine practitioner who desires to make a careerchange. Universities and colleges that offer pro-grams in clinical and health-related professions,such as veterinary technology and equine and ani-mal sciences are frequently recruiting for adjunctfaculty positions. The experienced practitioner canoffer a perspective of knowledge and practicality that is refreshing in the classroom. Dr. Dean Hendrickson, Professor of Surgery and former Director of the Colorado State University(CSU) Veterinary Teaching Hospital, acknowledgedthe value of experienced practitioners in the role ofclinical teaching. He described the desired \"hy-brid\" as an excellent clinician who is also an excel-lent educator and is most suitable for teaching inareas of primary care such as equine eld service. 1 Similarly, Dr. Bryan Slinker, Dean of the College ofVeterinary Medicine at Washington State Univer-sity, discussed a variety of roles intended for generalpractitioners who are recruited to teach veterinarystudents, especially in the areas of primary care.Washington State University has deliberately part- nered with clinicians in the private industry to offerformal training programs for veterinary students. 2 In fact, experienced clinicians can offer advanta- geous teaching skills that complement those of spe-cialists. Dr. Emma Read and Dr. Sarah Baillierecently considered the challenges faced by veteri-nary students as they learned a new skill or tech-nique. They evaluated techniques used toeffectively teach the skill and decision-making pro-cess for bovine dystocias, recognizing how the learn-ing curve is even more complex for the student whenthe procedure is internal and unsighted as with 270 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICE NOTESobstetrics. \"Learning is easier when detailed in-structions are available, but experts often nd itdifcult to articulate all of the steps involved in atask or relate to the learner as a novice.\" Bringing inveteran bovine practitioners who could provide rel-evant step-by-step instruction enhanced the overallteaching experience and improved performance out-comes for the students. In addition, as teachingprotocols were established for this study, the differ-ent approaches between experts highlighted theneed for consensus before teaching the skill. 3 Keep in mind that well-practiced generalists are valued experts. Dr. Stephen May brings to our at-tention that \"a difculty in understanding primaryhealth care expertise arises from the way in whichthe term 'expert' and 'specialist' have become synon-ymous in the minds of many, with the implicationsthat the generalist is not an expert.\" He empha-sizes the achievements of rst opinion practice andthose responsible for its delivery. From his view-point, formally integrating \"expert generalists\" intoveterinary teaching programs should be stronglyconsidered as we best prepare professionals for ca-reers in primary health care. 4 Teaching both the art and the science of equine practice becomes relevant. Qualied practitionersbring forward supplementary experience and under-standing in their teaching styles. Through thecourse of practice, reflective practitioners havelikely accomplished important skills in critical anal-ysis and evidence-based decision making. In addi-tion, they offer remarkable guidance regardingclient relations, communication skills, and businessmanagement. Equine practitioners also play an essential role as ambassadors, building bridges between academic in-stitutions and the equine industry. Dr. JerryBlack, founder of Pioneer Equine Hospital and pres-ent Director of Equine Sciences at CSU, commentedthat many organizations in the equine industryhave provided tremendous contribution as educa-tional partners by sponsoring programs, offeringscholarships, and even creating internship opportu-nities for students. 5Equine practitioners have usually established trustworthy relations with in- dustry partners through years dedicated to clinicalpractice and building successful businesses. Thisgreatly enhances the overall network. Pursuing an academic career path will be interest driven and custom designed for each individual.Whether you are a specialist who has always thrivedwithin the academic domain or an experienced cli-nician returning after years in the eld, keep inmind that each member plays a vital role in theeducation of young professionals. 2. Preparing the Pathway Many of us as practitioners have crafted intentionalteaching moments throughout our career pathway.We offer client seminars, presentations to the local4H club, a guest appearance to our child's kinder-garten class, a written article for a horse owners' publication, a continuing education seminar for ourState Veterinary Medical Association, or a how-topaper at an American Association of Equine Practi-tioners Convention. The opportunities to developyour skills as an educator are plentiful and readilyavailable. Many who formally transition into a ca-reer of education have built a track record of signingup for such education opportunities. Identify your personal strengths and run with them. To successfully lead as an educator, youhave to rst believe that you will have a positiveeffect on others. You must have condence thatyour words will inspire and your actions can moveothers. Believe wholeheartedly that what youteach will make a difference. Then the questionbecomes, \"What difference do you want to make?\"Identify your unique abilities and activities forwhich you have superior skill, passion, energy, and anever-ending desire to learn. Leverage what dis-tinguishes you and share it with others. Develop a forward-looking vision and chart the course. Once you have identied your desiredniche for teaching, begin to describe the details thatprovide you with a sense of direction toward specicgoals. This may represent the design of one pre-sentation or could signify creating an entire curric-ulum. Create a course outline that clearlyidenties the learning objectives. In effect, thisprovides clear denition of what the learner shouldbe able to demonstrate or perform upon successfulcompletion of their learning. Taylor emphasizesthat \"learning tasks and assessments that are con-structively aligned to intended learning outcomeshave a profound, positive effect on what and howstudents learn\". 6Know clearly where you want to go as you inspire and guide others who willingly join you on the educational journey. 3. Staying Relevant Accomplishing a degree as Doctor of VeterinaryMedicine through a rigorous 4-year professional pro-gram is only the beginning. Truly we are life-longlearners, encouraged to stay current over 40 years ofa career. To be capable and effective as clinicianswe recognize the importance of continuing educa-tion. Similarly, success as an educator requires usto be competent and up to date in our eld ofexpertise. Sometimes it's daunting to recognize the need to keep ourselves relevant. As we strive to keeplearning, keep in mind that we cannot be expected toknow it all. Technology, for example, has certainlybecome more advanced in the classroom. Technol-ogy has allowed us to expand our teaching methodswith innovation and creativity but does require askill set. Offering an online course presentationmay be new in your teaching experience. But donot let technology inhibit you. Keep an open mindand learn how to adapt to new approaches. And AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 271THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICEknow when to ask for help. You can always recruitthe assistance of a technology guru. For many of us, no one has taught us how to teach. If you desire to pursue the academic pathway, con-sider taking some courses in faculty development.There are notable afliations that hold symposiadistinctly for educators of the equine discipline inorder to facilitate sharing of information and ad-vance teaching methods. 7,8Staying relevant should also imply acquiring teaching skills to effec- tively create an active learning environment for ourstudents. Furthermore, consider another important dimen- sion of competence as an educator. Being function-ally competent in order to teach a skill or a conceptis necessary but may be insufcient. Albert Ein-stein declared, \"It is the supreme art of the Teacherto awaken joy in creative expression and knowl-edge.\" To ignite a passion for learning in othersrequires that an educator also brings forward value-added competence. Not only should we aim to ed-ucate the mind, but the heart as well. Successfuleducators demonstrate the abilities to challenge, en-courage, inspire, and unleash the potential of theirstudents. Developing and modeling these leader-ship skills is paramount to becoming influential asan educator. 4. Delivering Your Message Being effective as educators calls us to be excellentcommunicators. In conveying your message thereare always three presentations to consider: the oneyou deliver, the one you wanted to deliver, and theone your audience receives. The intention is tohave these three come into alignment in order toengage participants in a meaningful learningexperience. Gaining prociency and condence in your presen- tation skills will take dedicated practice. Continueto ne tune your writing and public speaking skillsin order to articulate your message clearly, conciselyand with energy. Pay attention to the techniquesused by those you deem as highly effective present-ers. Toastmasters International is a nonproteducational organization that operates clubs world-wide for the purpose of helping members improvetheir communication, public speaking, and leader-ship skills. 9Get out there, stretch yourself, and nd your voice. Capture your audience and develop strategies to maintain their responsiveness as you relay informa-tion. Frontloading, as an example, is a way of de-livering the most relevant part of your message rst.Make sure everyone quickly understands the bigideas of your message before diving into the details.Rambling creates frustration and could risk losingthe attention of your audience. Convey information in an organized manner that leads to rapid clarity. Avoid overloading informa-tion. Structure your message by emphasizing a fewkey points and then add depth to each with support-ing subpoints. Keep in mind that visual learning can be a powerful way to help people receive andintegrate new information. Any time you can showrather than tell, you'll reduce the risk that yourreceiver might misconstrue or confuse the message. PowerPoint has facilitated an easy delivery of our message, but we could risk boring our audience if weuse too much text. If our approach lacks focus orbecomes too wordy or dull we may miss the chance toearn the full attention of our audience. The textshould serve to guide the presenter and audiencewith summary points. Be creative as you designyour presentations with interesting and attractivevisuals. Know when to use images, animation, andvideos to help effectively communicate your mes-sage. Dr. Mary Beth Whitcomb has offered excel-lent advice on how to create engaging PowerPointpresentations and states, \"although my techniqueshave evolved over the years, my philosophy was, andcontinues to be, that veterinarians are no differentfrom toddlers transxed on Sesame Street, in whichthe actors capture the kids' attention with short,attractive, seemingly simple skits\". 10 Maintain a connection with your audience. Un- derstand what is important to them and recognizehow to deliver at their level of knowledge. Effectivepresenters have a way of reaching everyone in theroom regardless of their previous level of knowledge.They also create a positive, candid tone that invitestheir audience to engage. If you come across as thecondescending know-it-all expert you will likely loseyour listeners. Strive to stay tuned into the needsof your audience as well. Do you need to speakacross generational differences? Are you able topick up the vibes of your listeners? Developing thissense of awareness will help you know when toadjust the pace, explain in greater detail, shortenyour talk, invite participation, or actively listen. Can you use a relevant story to get your point across? Stories can be inspiring, informative, andoffer an invigorating break from the download ofmind-numbing facts. Your story should be distinc-tive, have clear purpose, and resonate with the au-dience. Often, a story can help others processcomplex information in a way that connects the dotsand brings new understanding. And you can havesome fun with people. As a nal thought, learn how to be prepared but loose in your presentation style. That means let-ting go of perfection. Stop worrying about a flaw-less presentation. Your audience is more likely torelate with you as you \"keep it real.\" 5. Implementing Your Plan Remain open and creative to possibilities as youseek a teaching appointment. Consider approach-ing Department Heads and Program Directors attargeted institutions to share your interests. Buildupon your network of colleagues and friends to cre-ate connections. Be willing to volunteer your time.Perhaps this means offering a guest lecture or serv- 272 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICEing on an advisory committee for a teaching institu-tion. As your interest, talent, and enthusiasm forteaching becomes evident, the right opportunity willbecome more likely. Make yourself marketable. Demonstrate that you have an established track record with stronginterest in teaching opportunities. A curriculumvitae should be provided when applying for a posi-tion in academia, whereas a resume is generallyused for applying to positions in the industry. Thecurriculum vitae is a comprehensive document usedin academic circles and medical careers that elabo-rates on education, publications, and other achieve-ments. Present a cover letter, whether you areapplying for a known position or inquiring aboutpositions, to describe what sets you apart and whyyou might be a good t for the teaching institution.Also be prepared to give a presentation as somehiring authorities may want to evaluate your publicspeaking skills. Research the program you are tar-geting so you can nd areas of commonality betweenyou and reveal the right t. Negotiating a letter of appointment will look dif- ferent in each situation. When hired as an adjunctfaculty, the position frequently begins part-timewith reimbursement based upon the number ofcredit hours taught. Do not expect a high-payingsalary and employment benets. For many, thebenets come in other ways, such as the ability tohave a flexible schedule. Full-time positions withall the benets are obtainable. As you get your footin the door, additional teaching opportunities maybecome available. Find encouragement from those who have already successfully paved the pathway. Dr. StephanieBrault reminds us to be persistent. In her case, shewas facing a career transition while she and herhusband were relocating a home, acquiring a newveterinary business and starting a family. Thoughit took 6 months, she purposefully was able to obtaina teaching appointment at a community college in-structing health-care professionals, which offeredher appropriate and timely employment. 11Dr. Elisabeth Giedt, presently the Director of Continu- ing Education for the Center of Veterinary HealthSciences at Oklahoma State University, reminds usto draw upon our network of friends. A client whowas an alumnus of a small college initially recom-mended her as an instructor. This launched a suc-cessful transition for her from practice into anexpanding career pathway in academia. 12Dr. Jerry Black inspires us to be ready to serve. In addition to his many years of active practice andentrepreneurship, he has a long list of involvementsin teaching, serving, and leading national organiza-tions. Specically he was invited to participatewithin an advisory committee to review the curric-ulum and strategically plan for the Equine SciencesProgram at CSU. Ultimately this led him to be-coming the Director of the program. He describesthe pathway as a \"great opportunity for a second career\". 4 6. Concluding Remarks Serving and building up others through the role asan educator is a privileged position and creates nu-merous advantages for everyone engaged in thelearning experience. From a viewpoint of practicality, making a tran- sition into education may allow a stimulating newcareer pathway that supports a different lifestylechoice. For those who have served in the eld as anequine practitioner, we recognize the demands of ajob that require our mental, emotional, and physicalstamina. Equine veterinarians are tough. Andalthough we are respected for this resilience, weoften nd ourselves needing to adapt to changingsituations throughout our career paths. Perhaps aphysical health condition has created a new chal-lenge to performing hind limb flexion tests. Per-haps a new child in your family changes your abilityto go treat the colic in the middle of the night.Perhaps you are facing mental fatigue from 20 yearsof managing the expectations of others. Whetherby default or design, being able to transition intoteaching could be inspirational as you offer yourgifts with a new approach. Finding the right t as a teacher can launch your unique talents. As veterinary doctors, we are ac-customed to relaying information to our clients.As caregivers, by our nature, we are drawn to helpothers. As lifelong students of the veterinary pro-fession, we are stimulated by continually advancingour knowledge. We continue to discover our inter-ests and abilities as we evolve through our careerpath. Becoming actively involved as an educatormay offer the perfect opportunity, allowing you tosuccessfully share your knowledge and experiencewith others. Teaching becomes a deeply gratifying mission. Being able to instruct, encourage, and influenceupcoming professionals and contribute in their suc-cesses brings tremendous reward. As we distin-guish the gifts of what we have to offer, we should beinspired to share them with others. As WoodrowWilson once stated, \"You are not here merely tomake a living. You are here in order to enable theworld to live more amply, with greater vision, with aner spirit of hope and achievement. You are hereto enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself ifyou forget the errand.\" Do not expect to do this alone. As educators we share the responsibilities to enhance the foundationof knowledge within our industry and help othersachieve their goals. You should not be operating inisolation, but rather cooperation. Collaboratingwith partners who have unique talents in differentareas and aligning team members toward a commonvision becomes powerful in effect. Performanceand results improve for the overall team when indi-viduals are passionate and offering their talents and AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 273THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICEsuperior skill. An effective team can radiate possi-bilities to create an outcome greater than the sum ofits parts. Finally, create the classroom wherever you are! Participating as an educator is really about desiringto make a positive difference in the lives of others.Chose to become the visionary and realize that youcould be that person who inspires another to a reachfor a new destination.

Introduction A veterinary education provides the foundationfor a wide range of career opportunities, yet theresources needed to evaluate alternate careerpaths are not easy to nd. Some career transi-tions are anticipated and planned for, whereas oth- ers become a necessity due to changes in personallife, dissatisfaction with current employment, burn-out, boredom, or a combination. When I attendedveterinary school I had my sights set on a career inclinical practice, not unlike the majority of today'sveterinary students. Following graduation, I pur-sued a large-animal internship followed by a large-animal residency in internal medicine leading toboard certication. Three decades ago, specialtytraining groomed a clinician for a position in aca-demia, given that there were relatively few privateequine hospitals large enough to support multipleequine specialists. In academia, clinicians wereencouraged to develop areas of clinical expertise andthe awakening specialties of large-animal neonatol-ogy and perinatology became my focus. Academicpractice provided a robust and varied caseload, a strong group of mentors from many specialties, aswell as the politics, layered decision making, andsome of the red tape that develops within largeoperations. Following 15 years in academia, a change in per- sonal life prompted a transition into private practiceat two expanding, multi-person equine specialtyhospitals with the goal of developing a medicinereferral service and NICU at each facility. Privatepractice offered the rewarding opportunity to bringaffordable neonatal care closer to the end user whilechallenging me to re-hone other internal medicine skills beyond the scope of equine neonatology. Itwas a memorable transition: leaving academia,where I had been a member of one of the largestequine internal medicine departments that includeda workforce of interns, residents, and veterinarystudents, and entering a private practice, where Ibecame a medicine department of \"one.\" But pri-vate practice also offered the support of a smaller,resourceful, and more nimble team of clinical spe- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 275THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICE NOTEScialists in surgery, reproduction, and sport horsemedicine; one or more interns; visiting veterinariansand student externs; outstanding, cross-trainedtechnicians; and a volunteer group of enthusiasticpre-veterinary student foal sitters. New areas ofclinical interest emerged, including ophthalmology,ultrasonography, and neurology. No longer physi-cally surrounded by multiple large-animal special-ists, close relationships were forged with an evenwider range of respected colleagues and new men-tors who were only a phone call or email away re-gardless of their zip code whenever I was challengedby difcult or puzzling cases. That networking andfeeling part a larger equine veterinary communitywas one of the unexpected highlights of private prac-tice. Lecturing continued both at regional, na-tional, and international meetings, as well as forclinic-organized events hosted for referring veteri-narians and horse owners. Pharmaceutical compa-nies occasionally invited me to give lectures in areasof my expertise. Unknowingly, I began to meet in-dividuals who would later become a more integralpart of the next, and unexpected, phase of my pro-fessional career. In private group practice, the teamwork among clinicians, nurses, and interns often resulted in in-creased efciency in terms of manpower and timewhen it came to many patient procedures. Therewas more direct accountability for patient care fromadmission to discharge that included diagnostics,treatments, and billing. But with fewer teammembers, there were more on-call emergency hours,especially during foaling season, which stretchedfrom early winter into mid summer in the mid-Atlantic region. But all aspects considered, private practice was extremely rewarding and my next transition did notoccur because I was unhappy with private practice.It was a difcult decision. A move to industry wasnot planned until another change in my personal lifeincluded a long-distance move to the bluffs of west-ern Wisconsin, where the nearest specialty practiceor veterinary school was at least 2-3 hours away.Fortuitously, at a crossroad in my career, colleagueswithin industry approached me about a job open-ing as an equine technical service veterinarianand encouraged me to apply. The result was asecond career transition from private specialtypractice to a position in the animal health indus-try at Intervet, Inc. 2.

May 2016): \"Technical services veterinarian: Lots of driving, meeting new people and learning more thanyou ever wanted to know about the minutiae ofkibble manufacturing (or drug manufacturing de-pending on your company). It's a different side of veterinary medicine, but immensely rewarding forthose extroverted enough to enjoy all the meetings.\"There is travel involved with most TS positions, butindustry jobs open far more educational avenues fordiverse training than this 'tunnel-vision' denitionof learning suggests. Others view a veterinary jobin industry as the last step before a cane and retire-ment while a polar opposite conception is that youshould carry photographs of your spouse, family,pets, and back yard given that you will forget whatthey look like due to a relentless travel schedule.Fortunately, those are both misconceptions sincethere is far more diversity, flexibility, and careeropportunity within industry for talented equine vet-erinarians with a wide variety of skill sets. Within an animal-health company, the equine business unit exists either as a stand-alone businessor as part of a larger unit composed of one or morespecie teams. Some companies combine equine andcompanion animal species, whereas others groupthe equine team with the food animal business unit.The equine group includes TS veterinarians, a salesteam composed of regional eld-based representatives,as well as inside representatives who are ofce basedand contact accounts via phone and emails, a market-ing manager and associated advertising agencies, andthe business unit director. Although there are differ-ent career options available, the most popular positionfor equine veterinarians is as a TS veterinarian.The American Veterinary Medical Association(AVMA) Market Research Statistics on US veterinarypositions for 2015 (www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Sta-tistics) reveal the following demographics for veteri-nary jobs in industry: In 2015 a total of 15,854 veterinarians were employed by the public or corporate sectorsthat included academia, federal, state, or localgovernment, uniformed services, industry, andother public or corporate employers. Basedon sex, 47.8% of those veterinarians were maleand 52.2% were female. A total of 3324 veterinarians were employed specically within industry (21% of the abovepopulation) with 56.9% males and 43.1%females. Based on a review of AVMA statistics from previous years, those percentages havechanged only slightly since 2007. Job responsibilities for a TS veterinarian include time in the eld traveling with the sales team tovisit with veterinarians individually as well as atlarger group meetings. Discussions might covera specic question about a product to an in-depthconversation about biosecurity in the midst of aninfectious disease outbreak or an exploratory dis-cussion to hear about unmet needs in equine vac-cines or pharmaceuticals. On most of these tripsthe windshield time between clinic stops is spent 276 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICEconversing with a fellow team member/sales rep-resentative about the health of the local equineindustry, answering questions about productsranging from mode of action of a dewormer toonset of immunity for a vaccine. The sales teambecomes your surrogate family and friendshipsare forged. Other responsibilities include re-viewing and helping create marketing and techni-cal bulletins, preparing PowerPoint presentationsand proceedings articles for upcoming confer-ences, developing webinars for veterinarians orlay personnel such as Pony Club members, re-searching topics of concern that arise during vet-erinary meetings, preparing an abstract or journalarticle for submission, helping design and monitorpost-licensing market support trials, as well ascompleting more mundane tasks such as expensereports and online training modules. Figure 1depicts additional networking that can occur de-pending on your interests, talents, and specic jobdescription. TS veterinarians often work with re-search and development to address questionsabout vaccines or drugs in development. Newideas gathered from the eld are directed towardbusiness development. Some veterinarians willspend some time providing pharmacovigilancesupport to address all calls from veterinarians andowners regarding an adverse event or lack of ef-cacy concern involving a company product. With the above job description in mind, it is not difcult to compose of list of helpful attributes forthose considering a TS position: Good communication skills in a variety of sit- uations ranging from casual one-on-one con-versation with a colleague to formal lectures infront of large groups. Reasonable computer skills that include famil- iarity with creating PowerPoint presentations,hosting webinars, and navigating through spreadsheets. Willingness to travel and the temperament to tolerate the unavoidable travel delays andmishaps that are bound to occur. Enthusiasm for educating and sharing infor- mation with diverse audiences that includeveterinarians, technicians, students, horseowners, and allied industry partners. Passion for learning given that the job may require tackling topics outside your area ofexpertise. 3. Frequently Asked Questions Encountered When Considering a Transition to a Job in the Animal HealthIndustry Reservations that frequently arise when contem- plating a change in jobs from private practice toindustry include the following: Will I lose my clinical skill set and acumen honed by caring for patients on a daily basis? An industry position provides the opportunity to attend and participate in a wider variety of confer-ences and CE events that might not have been pos-sible in private practice due to a lack of time andemergency coverage. Additional training in areasof interest is supported if the need is justied.The job is what you make it. Rather than thedrudgery and tunnel vision of learning only the mi-nutiae about one company's line of biologics andpharmaceuticals, the job allows you to expand yourknowledge base and to dig deeper into areas ofveterinary medicine that include immunology, infec-tious disease mitigation and surveillance, antimicro-bial and parasiticide resistance, and new avenues ofpain control. The quest for new technology interms of vaccines, antibiotic alternatives, new strat-egies for prevention, and control of osteoarthritis arejust a few of the challenges that can become yournew crusade. Will I miss private practice including the pa- tients, the clients, the staff, and the referringveterinarians? How will the corporate cul-ture compare? Based on results of a 2014 American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) listserv members sur-vey, 2three key features emerged as strong determi - nants for job satisfaction among practitioners: ahealthy and compatible practice culture, the degreeof control and choice they had over their individualprofessional lifestyle, and a manageable level ofstress. The same factors can be applied to a careerin industry. Animal health companies also differ intheir corporate and species-specic team cultures.Personalities within equine groups consisting of vet-erinarians, sales representatives, the business unitdirector, and marketing manager, etc., will also vary Fig. 1. Examples of working relationships between technicalservices, other departments within an animal health industrycompany, and the veterinary community. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 277THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICEbetween companies. Important interpersonal rela-tionships develop just as they do in practice. Theopportunity to travel and visit a wide variety ofpractices throughout the country offers new andunique perspectives of equine practice that is rarelyoffered during a career forged within a single prac-tice or one segment of the industry. Regional salesrepresentatives become not only tour guides of theirterritories, but often an honorary family member. Will I be able to adapt to the change of pace and challenges of a job that might require con-siderable travel? How will I handle nights onthe road away from home and family? The rigors of a tedious travel schedule seem to loomat the top of real or perceived perils associated witha TS position within the animal health industry.TS positions may vary in the percentage of timespent on the road with 40-50% of your time spenttraveling or attending conferences and lectures.Depending on the company, territory, and job de-scription, some of that travel may encompass daytrips that helps minimize nights away from home.In many instances, you control and design yourtravel schedule, which is preferable to the unpre-dictability of emergency on-call duties in privatepractice that can drag you away unexpectedly from afamily event or long-anticipated home-cooked mealat a moment's notice. One bonus of a busy travelschedule includes accumulation of frequent flyermiles and hotel bonus points that can be used forfuture family getaways. When not traveling, mostTS veterinarians have the added benet that theycan work from a home ofce via webinars, confer-ence calls, and emails. How will my specialty training or advanced degrees be valued by industry? Will my indi-viduality be lost within a large corporatestructure? Marketing your attributes and clinical expertise andexperience is up to you. Most TS jobs value formalspecialty training, business degrees, and/or valuableyears of clinical experience. The job market is com-petitive and veterinarians who have practical clini-cal experience are often preferred over newgraduates for TS veterinary positions. Within theanimal health industry there are a variety of careeravenues to consider. A TS veterinarian spends con-siderable time supporting the needs of the salesteam and their veterinary customers, provides valu-able feedback about what equine veterinarians viewas unmet needs within equine practice, as well asedits and/or writes TS bulletins and marketingpieces. What additional career paths exist for an equine veterinarian within the animal healthindustry?In addition to a position as a TS veterinarian who supports the sales team and marketing with up-to-date data from personal expertise and company-sponsored market-support trials and time spent inthe eld riding with regional sales representatives,alternate career paths include managerial roleswithin the equine business unit and larger corporatestructure, an active role within the research anddevelopment divisions if your background includesresearch training in key areas such as immunologyor pharmacology, a managerial role in marketing orsales if you have a strong background in businessand people management, pharmacovigilance thatinvolves monitoring efcacy and adverse events in-volving the company's equine product line, or a rolein business development focusing on discovery andimplementation of new technology. When joining alarge corporation the worry of feeling like a smallsh in a big pond can occur, but your talents andcareer goals can quickly align you with a smallergroup of colleagues who become your new team. Will I lose my credibility as a clinician? How will my colleagues view my career change? Frequent interactions with equine practitioners to discuss and offer solutions to practice problems andunmet clinical needs, opportunities to participate ina broad array of CE courses both as attendee andlecturer, time spent designing and evaluating re-sults of market support trials are a few examples ofhow clinical expertise can be redirected. Job satis-faction is one of the best testimonies that a positionwithin the animal health industry can be a reward-ing career. Seeing a happy, motivated veterinarianin their new role intrigues many colleagues to re-think potential misconceptions of a job within theanimal-health eld. Whether you participate inthe design of market support trials and present thedata generated or render advice to business devel-opment personnel regarding pursuit of new productsor technologies, you may nd yourself interactingwith respected colleagues in new ways that serve tostrengthen existing relationships. Loss of credibil-ity is rarely an issue if the job ts your aspirations,talents, and work/life balance. Will I lose control over my career or lose my job through unexpected corporate mergers andacquisitions? The one variable that cannot be controlled is the prospect of future corporate mergers, acquisitions,or divestitures. But, private practice also carrieswith it the threat of new competition and/or a de-clining client and patient base. Is this a nancially sound move? Industry jobs provide a good base salary that is often supplemented by bonuses based on the business 278 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICEunit's and animal health company's performance.Base compensation is usually determined by an em-ployee's actual position in the marketplace andsustained performance over time, as well as devel-opment of skills and abilities. Incentive pay mightinclude bonuses that motivate employees to achievehigh levels of performance for both the individualand the company. Long-term incentives includeequity-based incentives that recognize future poten-tial for signicant contribution to the company. There are comprehensive health benets pack- ages (including dental and vision), and a 401(k)/pension/retirement plan. In addition to majorholidays, there are usually good vacation packages.Without the worry of after-hour emergency calls or aclinic full of patients, vacation time may becomemore relaxing and that is priceless. What skill sets will this new position require? Good communication skills are a fundamental re-quirement. An industry job includes many per-sonal conversations with veterinarians face to face,by phone, or by email. There are countless teach-able moments when riding with sale representativeswho are often experts within certain segments of theequine industry and are hungry for more scienticknowledge to improve their customer relationships.There are numerous requests for informal, small-group presentations as well as formal lectures in front of larger audiences at regional or national vet-erinary conferences. Technical expertise is alsohelpful and includes a comfort level with creatingPowerPoint presentations, hosting internal and ex-ternal webinars, or sorting through Excel spread-sheets containing trial data. A flair for technicaland scientic writing is always a welcome talent. Can I continue to make valuable and satisfying contributions to the veterinary profession? Without the constraints of emergency duty, a busy patient caseload, and other day-to-day and after-hour responsibilities associated with private prac-tice, you are able to pursue valuable volunteeropportunities within a range of veterinary organiza-tions including service on committees or taskforceswithin the AAEP, AVMA, specialty colleges, or stateand regional veterinary organizations. There maybe time to participate on an equitarian mission orauthor a scientic article for a peer-reviewed journalor a book chapter or become more involved in publicpolicy or equine welfare issues. In practice we of-ten focus on the welfare of one patient at a time.Within industry we have the opportunity to influ-ence the lives of many, whether working on thedevelopment of a new vaccine or sharing new dataabout disease management with our colleagues.Table 1. Examples of Benets and Challenges of a Veterinary Career in IndustryAdvantages/Benets Disadvantages/Challenges Good benets package: salary, health insurance (including dental and eye), company vehicle, retirement programsTravel schedule: nights away from home and the typical hassles of dealing with unexpected traveldelays Ability to work from home when not traveling Larger bureaucracy with understandably long lists of rules and regulations to follow; annual requirementsto take on-line training courses covering a variety ofissues from compliance to ethics Educational opportunities to pursue additional training in areas of interestSome trials, presentations, scientic bulletins take longer to complete than expected due to a multi-layered review and approval process to ensurescientic accuracy and compliance with regulatoryguidelines Time to attend CE conferences and enhance participation in organized veterinary organizations: AAEP, AVMA, ACVIM,ACVS, ACT, etc.Large organizational infrastructure with multiple sites of operation usually necessitates that internalcommunications occur electronically rather than atface to face meetings Expanding your sphere of contacts within equine veterinary industry; reconnecting with colleagues, past students, residentsand mentorsCorporate merger or acquisition resulting in reorganization Relief of stress associated with on-call emergency schedule and/ or practice management responsibilities Improved public speaking and presentation skillsGaining a broader perspective of the equine industry during travel throughout the United States Having the opportunity to affect the welfare of large populations of horses through development of new drugs and vaccines andthrough company subsidized diagnostic services to supportveterinary practices AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 279THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICEWhat to Do if You Are Contemplating a Job in Industry Given that there are few formal Internet resourcesthat provide specic answers about industry jobs,individuals interested in learning more about a ca-reer in industry should not hesitate to reach outto as many veterinarians currently employed by ananimal health company as possible to gather a widearray of opinions, advice, and perspectives.

Taking the pulse of the equine veterinary industry: Results from the 2014 Amer-ican Association of BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICETransitioning From Clinical Practice Into a Government Career Introduction Almost 28 percent of veterinarians in clinicalpractice might seek to transition to a nonclinicalveterinary career at some point in the future orare currently seeking such a transition, accordingto a 2013 survey spearheaded by the 2013-2014class of the American Veterinary Medical Associ-ation (AVMA) Future Leaders Program: https:// www.avma.org/ ProfessionalDevelopment/Personal/ CareerTransitions/Pages/default.aspx. Over 4000 veterinarians work for the local, state, and federal government as clinical practitioners, re-searchers, inspectors, and other professions. Morethan half of the veterinarians in the federal govern-ment work for the various agencies in the U.S. De-partment of Agriculture, including the Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service and the Food Safetyand Inspection Service. A few other federal agen-cies that employ veterinarians are the Food andDrug Administration, Centers for Disease Controland Prevention, National Institutes of Health, En-vironmental Protection Agency, and the Depart-ment of Homeland Security. Veterinarians alsoserve in the military and the Commissioned Corps ofthe U.S. Public Health Service. Their work may involve treating animals for inju- ries and illnesses, conducting clinical research onhuman and animal health problems, getting rid ofmajor animal diseases, promoting public health, in- specting livestock or food products, enforcing foodsafety regulation, or managing and administeringprograms. Veterinarians specically in the federalgovernment earned an estimated mean annual wageof $89,480 in 2015, according to the U.S. Bureau ofLabor Statistics. But what you may not expect is that government veterinarians go into space with NASA and performsurgery on elephants at the National Zoo. Veteri-narians can also be elected to Congress. Currently,Dr. Kurt Schrader, a Democrat from Oregon, Dr.Ted Yoho, a Republican from Florida, and Dr. RalphAbraham, a Republican from Louisiana, serve in theU.S. House of Representatives. Successfully making a government career tran- sition requires self reflection, courage, and persis-tency. I had to do some sincere reflection ontransitioning from practice to a government careerbecause many would say that you are not a veter-inarian if you are not practicing. I realized thatwas not the case. Beginning my career early ingovernment allowed me to contribute even more tothe livelihood and well being of horses and clients.Another advantage was I did not have to get an additional degree beyond the DVM. That is thewonderful thing about our veterinary degree. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 281THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICE NOTESA veterinary education prepares us to do so muchmore than traditional veterinary practice. Therefore, after nding a eld of interest in the government, it is important to network to learnmore about the eld and get to know people. Stepscan include informational interviews, shadowing,volunteering, or internships. Social media connec-tions such as LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/)has been an invaluable source for me to meet indi-viduals that I would like to work with throughoutmy career. Re\u00b4sume \u00b4 writing is another important piece of a career transitioning to the government. You needto explain how your background applies to the newposition. Clinical practitioners develop all sorts ofskills, from communications to the control of infec-tious disease. More importantly, the federal gov-ernment does not want a one-page resume. It isimperative you provide all the training and experi-ence you have developed ever since you graduatedfrom veterinary school and even activities you dooutside your normal workday. Many of us volun-teer for committees and task forces and do not everrealize how that is also part of our growth of lead-ership, communicating effectively and buildingrelationships. When looking for a position within the govern- ment, it is important to learn about ways to searchfor all positions that are suitable, not just ones thatare specically listed as requiring a veterinary de-gree or clinical experience. The top database for federal government jobs is USAJOBS (www.usajobs.gov). What follows arehints on how to look for government jobs in thisdatabase. There are several terms that are helpful to know when navigating and conducting searches on theUSAJOBS Web site: The rst is \"General Schedule\" (GS) level. A GS level is the federal government's way to keep sala-ries consistent among federal agency jobs and makesure there is equal pay for equal work. There arecurrently 15 grades and 10 steps. For the GSsalaries for 2016, visit the following link: https://www.opm.gov/policy-date-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2016/general-schedule/. Veterinarians shouldsearch for GS grade 11 or higher when setting search parameters. Typically, new graduates start at GSgrade 11 step 1; however, most positions move up tothe next grade the next year and you are qualied toapply for the next grade. I started actually at a GSgrade 9 step 5 and in 5 years I moved up to a GSgrade 14 step 1 in which I doubled my salary. The second term to know is \"series,\" which is the term for certain job classications within USA-JOBS. Using the appropriate series numbers aswell as broad term key words will help to identify joblistings that may be suitable for veterinarians.Visit http://www.opm.gov/fedclass/ for a completeexplanation of this classication and grading of fed-eral jobs.The federal government series numbers that may be appropriate for veterinary-related jobs are asfollows: 400 series (Wildlife/Conservation/Department of Interior) 600 series (specically 601-General Health Science) 700 series (specically 701-Veterinary Medical Science) 1300 series (Physical Science) 1800 series (Inspection, Investigation, En- forcement and Compliance) Some of the broad word criteria or keyword terms that can help locate jobs are below: Animal Biodefense Biologist/Biology Chemist/Chemistry Epidemiologist/Epidemiology General Health Science Health Scientist Medical Ofcer Microbiologist/Microbiology Public Health Program Specialist/Public Health Veterinary Medical Ofcer Veterinary Wildlife Zoonotic To nd a job at USAJOBS, you can either enter search criteria each time, or you can set up a \"ClientAccount\" through which you can save differentsearches based on combinations of criteria you se-lect. With the client account, you can even set it upso that you are automatically e-mailed when jobsmeeting your criteria are posted on the site, savingyou the time of actively searching for them. The search criteria you use may be as wide or narrow as you like. Performing a search using keywords such as \"animal,\" \"wildlife,\" or \"epidemiology\"will produce a wide variety of potential jobs, forsome of which veterinarians will be overqualied.Narrower searches, such as using the series num-ber, job title such as \"veterinarian,\" \"veterinarymedical ofcer,\" \"animal scientist,\" or other speci-cation, will yield fewer but more targeted job post-ings. Further narrowing the search criteria by GSlevel, location, or other factors will provide an evenmore precise listing of the desired jobs available. Also, setting up a \"Client Account\" on USAJOBS will allow you to upload your resume so when posi-tions are posted that you are interested in, you canapply immediately. This is important becausesome positions only allow the rst 30-50 applicantsto apply or are only open for 1 week. 282 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICEOther helpful resources for learning more about veterinary career opportunities in the governmentare below: 1.AVMA Webinar: Finding & Applying for Veterinary Federal Jobs: This webinar was put on by the AVMA's Career Center and provides prac-tical guidance on the whole intimidating process oflanding that cushy government job.

Miller, DVM Short-term, long-term, and permanent disability can pose signicant nancial, physical, emotional,and psychological threats to equine veterinarians and veterinary students. The purpose of thispaper is to help veterinarians prepare for and navigate through this unexpected transition. Author'saddress: 2307 64th \u00a9 2016AAEP. 1. Introduction No one likes to think about the possibility of becom-ing disabled. Equine veterinarians accept the risksof working with horses just as people accept the riskof driving a vehicle. Risk is a part of life. Duringthe Problems Facing Veterinarians in Small Prac-tices Table Topic held at the 58th Annual Conven-tion of the American Association of EquinePractitioners in Anaheim, California, the subject ofdisability was raised, and an informal poll revealedthe vast majority of veterinarians participating hadno long- or short-term disability insurance. Manyof these veterinarians had recently opened solo prac-tices and borrowed money to pursue the dream ofowning their own business. Hopefully, the dreamwas not blindsided by an unexpected transition intoa disabling illness or injury. According to the United States Social Security Administration, 25% of current 20-year-olds will be-come disabled prior to reaching the age of 67 years. 1 An illness or accident will keep one in ve workersout of work for at least a year before the age of 65years. 2More than 37 million Americans, 12% of the total population, are classied as disabled withmore than 50% of these being in their working years from 18-64 years of age.3\"Less than 5% of dis - abling accidents and illnesses are work related; theother 95% are not, meaning Workers' Compensationdoes not provide coverage.\" 4\"It is common for peo - ple to associate disability with serious accidents, butin reality the majority of disabilities are caused by illnesses. Even people who do not have a high-riskjob are at risk from disability from musculoskeletal,cardiovascular, cancer, psychiatric, or other ill-nesses.\" 5Sixty-nine percent of the workforce in the private sector has no long-term disability insurance.1 Table 1 presents the disability claims led by par- ticipants in the American Veterinary Medical Asso-ciation Group Life Insurance Trust (now known asAVMA Life) during 2014 and 2015. a It is important to note that the data reflect only veterinarians who are members of the AmericanVeterinary Medical Association who have purchaseddisability insurance from AVMA Life. Differentia-tion of disability due to accident or illness cannot beprovided due to the privacy and security of medicalinformation under the Health Insurance Portability 284 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICE NOTESand Accountability Act (HIPAA), and there are nodemographic data as to practice type. In a Germanstudy, the rate of accidents reported to an insurancedatabase was 2.9 times higher for veterinariansthan for physicians in general practice. 6In a study commissioned by the British Equine Veterinary As- sociation and conducted by leading medical profes-sionals at the Institute of Health and Wellbeing andthe School of Veterinary Medicine at the Universityof Glasgow, 620 equine veterinarians completed awork-related-injuries questionnaire. \"The resultsof the study suggested that an equine vet couldexpect to sustain between seven and eight work-related injuries that impeded them from practicing,during a 30-year working life.\" 7Equine practice is a physically demanding, hands-on activity requiring quick reflexes, and in the event of an injury or ill-ness, the ability to earn an income can be lost.In most instances, there is no \"desk duty\" where onecan transition during convalescence and recovery.The nancial repercussions can be disastrous unlessone has planned ahead as prolonged loss of earnedincome can also result in decreased retirement in-come given that Social Security benets are depen-dent upon the stream of lifetime earnings, and IRAor 401k contributions may not be possible in theabsence of earned income. Financial pressures in-crease if there are extensive medical bills, and thestress of the injury or illness combined with nan-cial stressors can lead to emotional and psychologi-cal distress. The data demonstrates that there is asignicant risk of disability during one's career, so itis necessary to protect future income. 2. Solution The equine veterinarian needs to be prepared andplan ahead for the worst-case scenario by purchas-ing both health care insurance with comprehensivecatastrophic coverage and long-term disability in-surance. These coverages are the nancial liferafts for economic survival during a disability, andcoverage must be in place prior to the occurrence ofany accident or illness. Long-term disability insurance helps to safeguard self-employed veterinarians and their families fromdebt and a total depletion of savings. Veterinari-ans employed by private practices, public institu-tions, and corporations must know what benets areprovided as part of their benet package and deter-mine whether these benets are adequate in theevent of long-term or permanent disability.There are disability income insurance policies available for veterinary students who are not earn-ing income that cover tuition, student loans, andprovide income in the event of disability. Supple-mental Disability Income policies are also availablefor purchase to cover student loan obligations forrecent graduates. If a veterinarian is in private practice, whether as a solo practitioner or in a group practice, how willthe practice expenses be paid during a long-termdisability? Common expenses such as rent, equip-ment payments, staff salaries, answering service,electric, telephone, etc. will continue. Professionaloverhead expense insurance can be purchased tocover the business expenses and keep the businessoperational. In the case of all insurance policies, it is impera- tive to understand what is covered, what is ex-cluded, the duration of coverage, the commencementof payment of benets, and the duration of benetpayments. Always read the ne print and askquestions of the insurance agent and other veteri-narians. One needs to know how disability is de-ned, if there are residual benets that pay thedifference between what one earns as one transi-tions back to full-time work, and what was beingpaid in disability payments. Determine whetherthere is own occupation coverage that pays full ben-ets if one is able to return to work in a professionother than veterinary medicine. Seeking the advice of a certied nancial planner is prudent at any stage of life. A certied nancialplanner is a professional who is held to rigorousethical standards and has completed extensivetraining and experience requirements. Quite sim-ply, a certied nancial planner serves his or herclients in the management of wealth and risk fortheir families and businesses, and can assist theveterinarian with an individualized plan to helpwith budgeting, investing, planning for retirement,saving for education, and how to best manage taxesand insurance coverage through all stages of life.Minimal investable assets may range from $0 to inexcess of $500,000, and these professionals typicallywork for a fee plus commission. The importance ofhaving investments or savings to tide one over untildisability benets begin to be paid cannot be over-emphasized, and working with a certied nancialplanner will help the veterinarian stay on top ofshort- and long-term goals through the manychanges that occur during a lifetime. With the nancial house in order, the veterinarian can now focus attention onto who will provide carefor the clients' animals. In the multi-doctor prac-tice, this is generally covered by everyone shoulder-ing a heftier load or bringing in an associate.

Dr.Dwyer talks about facing the \"dark days,\" the dayswhere anger, frustration and self pity come to visit,and she emphasizes the value of a positive attitude.Clients, associates, friends, and family will step upin amazing ways to help, and in most cases, theveterinarian will heal and return to prac-tice. There is a small subset of veterinarians, how-ever, who will come to nd that they will neverreturn to equine practice, and this realization givesnew meaning to the concept of the darkdays. Equine practice is not just a job; it is a life-style and a vocation. There are ways to stay in-volved despite the inability to practice. If there isan economic hardship that can be demonstrated,both the American Association of Equine Practitio-ners (AAEP) and the American Veterinary MedicalAssociation (AVMA) have forms that can be submit-ted requesting a waiver of dues. Remaining amember of the AVMA is a requirement to maintainbenets if participating in the insurance programsoffered by AVMA Life. The ability to remain a par-ticipant or lurker on the various AAEP List Serveskeeps one connected with the community of equineveterinarians. 3. Discussion Workers' Compensation, also known as Workman'sComp, is a state-mandated insurance program thatprovides compensation to employees who suffer job-related injuries and illnesses. The requirement topurchase Workers' Compensation varies from stateto state. Workers' Compensation provides cover-age for medical expenses, lost wages from time offwork, rehabilitation, compensation for permanentimpairments, and occasionally, job retrain-ing. Workers' Compensation can provide moneyand benets to an injured worker in the form oftemporary disability and permanent disability pay-ments. In the case of a workplace death, Work-man's Compensation provides a death benet to theestate of the deceased. Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) is a fed- eral program that pays benets if the person isdeemed completely disabled according to the SocialSecurity Administration's denition of total disabil-ity and the person has worked and paid the FederalInsurance Contributions Act (FICA) premiums. It is not unusual for the approval of SSDI benets totake up to 2 years. To meet the criteria of totaldisability under the Social Security Administra-tion's denition, a worker cannot do the type of workthat was done before, cannot perform other workdue to the medical condition, and the disability willlast at least 1 year or result in death. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a Federal income supplement program funded by general taxrevenues designed to help aged ( /H1102265 y), blind, and disabled people who have little or no income to pro-vide the basic need for food, clothing, and shelter. Workers' Compensation and SSDI claims may re- quire the assistance of an attorney, and as explainedabove, the veterinarian may not qualify for anybenets. Long- and short-term disability insurance guaran- tees that a benet of known value is paid within adesignated period of time. If the disability pre-mium is being paid by the employer, the benets willbe taxable. With a plan paid for with after taxdollars by an individual, the benets will not betaxed, and the policy is portable if the veterinarianleaves the practice. If a veterinarian becomes dis-abled and is unable to work for 2 or 3 months,short-term disability insurance may be indicated ifthere are insufcient savings to cover living ex-penses during that time. Long-term disability in-surance provides income for an extended period oftime if the veterinarian is unable to work or can onlywork part time. Young veterinarians must notethat a \"25-year-old worker who makes $50,000 ayear and suffers a permanent disability could lose$3.8 million in future earnings.\" 9Any person who has a job should consider purchasing long-term dis- ability insurance. It is very important to have a primary physician and to make the time to go in for the annual wellvisit. Medical conditions that are diagnosed earlytypically have better outcomes. Developing trustin a doctor takes time, and having a medical advo-cate is invaluable in the event of a severe injury orillness. If the doctor owns, has owned, or has beenaround horses, this is an added bonus as there willbe familiarity with the job requirements of theequine veterinarian. In summary, purchasing a health insurance policy with catastrophic coverage and a long-term disabil-ity policy will keep a person nancially afloat duringa prolonged disability. This will alleviate thestress associated with exhausting savings and in-vestments and taking on debt. One may still haveto pare down nonessential items to budget for thechange in nancial circumstances. Working with acertied nancial planner may help to position theveterinarian better to withstand a decrease in earn-ings. Having a worst-case scenario plan in placewith area veterinarians and maintaining good med-ical records will allow for a smoother transition ofpatient care. Making time to nd a personal doctor 286 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICEand go for an annual checkup will ensure the bestpossible health. Staying in contact with friends,family and colleagues will raise your spirits andpromote a positive outlook. Find something thatgives your life meaning. Finally, nothing is betterfor the soul than being around a horse.

Janssen, DVM justinjanssendvm@gmail.com.\u00a9 2016 AAEP. 1. Introduction Equine practitioners should start early developingtheir retirement strategy. Retirement requiresmore effort than building a practice. The goal of this presentation is to encourage all ages of veterinarians from the recent graduate to theseasoned American Association of Equine Practitio-ners (AAEP) member to begin today planning theirretirement. Each individual's situation andchoices will be different. Are most busy equinepractitioners unknowingly addicted to the dailyadrenalin rush of just getting through the day?Does this addiction to adrenalin and the desire tocontinue building the practice prevent us from con-sidering or planning our stepping away from ourchosen avocation? In a 2015 report by Blach et al, 1an economic survey of nearly 500 AAEP members found that atleast 60% of practice owners are personally con-cerned about stress, retirement, and nancial secu-rity. Forty-two percent worry about being able tosell the practice. 1 AAEP as an organization and our equine prac- titioner colleagues often do not provide good rolemodels or education about retirement. Many of our classic AAEP mentors seem to be the sagepractitioners/members who continue to contribute toour profession by actively practicing and seem poised to transcend into heaven on their last farmcall. Each individual veterinarian's situation is unique and different, but there are some shared commonconcerns: Financial: income, insurance, succession planning, social security, retirement funds Spouse/family relationships Physical: lifestyle, health status Psychological: a male veterinarian's personal identity is closely linked to being a veterinar-ian. \"We are what we do.\" Can we give upour \"status\"? Religion/spiritual Hobbies, interests, volunteerism, passion Location: is retirement in our minds associ- ated with a physical relocation? This presentation will share the input of successful retired AAEP members who have chosen to retirewhile still alive! Their insights as to how long theyworked arranging their retirement, what they enjoymost about retirement, and advice to other veteri-narians will be presented. The take-home message for the equine practitio- ner is to start early developing their retirement 288 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICE NOTESstrategy.

Introduction My wife, Marilyn Schmidt, and I started the EquineClinic at Oakencroft in upstate New York and west-ern Massachusetts in 1986. Over the years it grewto a nine-doctor practice that had offered services to45,000 horses owned by 10,000 clients. I was ajack-of-all trades kind of a veterinarian, and I lovedthe work, the horses, and our clients. But afterMarilyn died in 2005 I came to realize that I wassupposed to be doing something else. 2. Selling the Practice Like many other closely held operations, the prac-tice had evolved into a blend of our professional lifeand our home life. We maintained a broodmareband for a major client that evolved into a separatebut not very distinct entity. Having that farm busi-ness allowed us to fold some personal horses andcattle and sheep into the operation as well. Giventhat we were the only two partners, none of thatmattered much, until it was time to sell. Do notunderestimate the time and effort it takes to \"cleanup\" the business so that the new buyers can com-fortably know what they are buying. For us, thattook 3 years, and the help of a practice consultantand a lawyer. Finding buyers took even longer. Shortly after Marilyn died, I needed to decide what my planswould be going forward. I still had one child inmiddle school, one in high school, and one just start- ing college. I could not afford to just quit, but I alsocould not work the hours I had been working andstill take care of the kids and myself. I looked forpromising young associates, and hired four to coverthe workload. During the next several years wehad some stafng changes, always keeping in mindthat I needed (in my mind) to sell the practice inter-nally. That meant that the practice would need tobe able to evolve from what we had started to whatthe new folks wanted. I worked with the potentialnew owners for 5 years to make that happen. Once the buyers were identied, I began to slowly hand over more information and decisions to them.We took the whole practice team (doctors, lay staff,farm staff) on a 3-day retreat to facilitate thechanges. Watching the changes happen was bothexciting and sad. 3. Off to the Seminary The discernment of a vocation to the priesthood is more about what God is asking than it is abouttrying to decide \"what I want to do next with mylife.\" When I accepted that becoming a Catholicpriest was God's plan, I moved to fold up the parts ofmy life that I would be leaving behind. This tookseveral years, and as a matter of faith, I can see thehand of God at work all along the way. In the end,I worked on my Masters in Divinity while the kids 290 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CLINICAL PRACTICE NOTESgot into college. My diocese has an upper age fornewly ordained, and I was at that limit. If I hadwaited for their nal decision, I would have franklybeen too old. So, before I was accepted into theseminary, I sold the practice, helped with the tran-sition, rented out the farm, handed off my roles inthe American Association of Equine Practitioners(AAEP) and Veterinary Study Groups 7 and 20, andtook a 3-month road trip to visit family and friends.It was a leap of faith appropriate to my new role. I then spent a year working in a parish and 2 more years in the seminary. I found that much of theservice ethic that resonates with veterinarianstransferred directly to my new life of ministry.In a very real sense, my time as a veterinarian andmy activity as an AAEP member were preparatoryand foundational for my new life as a priest. 4. Epilogue It is beyond the scope of this paper to explore priest-hood. In any event, I doubt that many are headedin that direction. But for each of us, there comes apoint of reflection about what we might do when wenish practice. The answers will be as varied asthe number of members we have, and that is won- derful. Every member of the AAEP has developedpersonal cultures, mindsets, skills, and intereststhat are directly transferable to other activities.For some that will revolve around giving backthrough volunteer work or teaching. Others willtake the opportunity to be there for family andfriends. Others may nd a whole new path. The AAEP has long held that in the moment that we haveto make a big decision, we ask ourselves the question,\"What is in the best interest of the welfare of thehorse?\" That selfless question has served our profes-sion well. Going forward, we might ask a corollaryquestion, \"What should I do with what I have beengifted with so far in my life?\" Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Suspensory ligament injuries are common in dres-sage horses and are thought to affect young horsesoffering the extended trot. Fetlock extension in-creases suspensory ligament strains. Fetlock ex-tension differed in racehorses galloping on differentsurfaces. This study compared fetlock extension indressage horses at the extended trot between syn-thetic and dirt arena surfaces. 2. Materials and Methods Fetlock angle was measured from two-dimensional,high-speed kinematic videos of six dressage horsestraveling at the extended trot on a synthetic arenasurface and on a dirt arena surface. Surface mechan-ical behaviors were characterized using an equine sur-face-testing device. Maximum fetlock angle andmaximum impact force were compared between sur-faces using mixed-model ANOVA that when appropri-ate accounted for surface, horse velocity, and repeatedmeasures within horse. 3. Results Maximum fetlock angle was greater on the syntheticsurface than dirt ( /H9004/H110052\u00b0;P/H11005.025). The maximumimpact force of the synthetic surface was 41% greater than the dirt surface (P /H11005.006). 4. Discussion Arena surface material affected maximum fetlock angle in dressage horses performing the extendedtrot. Fetlock extension was greater on the surfacethat had the greater peak impact force. Surfaceproperties have the potential to affect risk for sus-pensory ligament injury.

Introduction The gold standard of lameness localization is oftenaccomplished with regional anesthesia. However,some horses are dangerous to themselves, the vet-erinarian, and handler during this process, evenwith appropriate manual restraint. The use of lowdoses of sedatives may improve safety for all indi-viduals during these procedures. We hypothesizedthat administration of butorphanol would have a signicant effect onlameness. 2. Materials and Methods Sixteen polo horses with naturally occurring lame-ness were evaluated before and following of butorphanol (0.007 mg/kg). Subjective and objec-tive data were collected prior to treatment, and at10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 minutes following injection.Data were analyzed with mixed-model ANOVA withsignicance set at P/H11021.05. 3. Results Use of detomidine and romidine in combination with butorphanol resulted in signicant changes insubjective hindlimb, but not variables were more commonlywith detomidine and romidine either alone or withbutorphanol. 4. Conclusions Xylazine, either alone or in combination with butor-phanol, seems to have fewer effects on both subjec-tive and objective assessment of equine lameness.

Authors' address: Collegeof Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine, University of Illinois, 1008 WestHazelwood There are no refereed blinded controlled documen-tations of skeletal analgesic efcacy of acetamino-phen in horses. The objective was to test thehypotheses that oral acetaminophen and flunixinmeglumine (FM) are comparable in efcacy and aremore efcacious in alleviating lameness than nega-tive control in an adjustable heart bar shoe model ofequine foot pain. 2. Materials and Methods Eight healthy adult horses (5 Thoroughbred, 3Quarter Horse; mean age, 8.3 /H110060.9 y; age range, 4-13 y) randomly underwent weekly oral treat-ments 1 hour after lameness induction. Treat-ments were negative control, FM (1.1 mg/kg), andacetaminophen (20 mg/kg). One investigatorwho was unaware of treatment assignments mon-itored heart rate (HR) and lameness score (LS)every 20 minutes for 5 hours after lameness in- duction and then hourly through 12 hours aftertreatment. One and 2 weeks later treatmentswere shuffled and the experiment was repeated.Repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey'stest were used to identify analgesic effects at asignicance level of P/H11021.05. 3. Results Post-treatment acetaminophen HR (2.7, 4, 4.3, 9, 10, and 11 h) and LS (2.7, 3, and 5 h) were lowerthan negative control ( P/H11021.05). FM HR (2.7 and 9 h) and LS (3.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 h) were lowerthan negative control ( P/H11021.05). Acetaminophen and FM were not different from one another. 4. Discussion It was concluded that acetaminophen at this oraldosage was comparable to FM and both were moreefcacious than negative control.

However, interpretation ofthe venogram remains subjective. The purpose ofthis study was to evaluate venographic technique inathletic, non-laminitic horses and to describe varia-tions in the pattern. 2. Materials and Methods Horses were evaluated for lameness and survey radio-graphs were obtained for each foot. Venograms wereperformed in both front feet of 23 horses. Theamount of contrast and time required for infusion wasrecorded for each foot. Survey radiographs were eval-uated for bone and hoof angle, palmar angle, and soledepth. Venograms were graded for contrast distribu-tion throughout the digital vasculature.3. Results A total of 45 venograms in 23 horses were success-fully performed. Amount of contrast infused ineach foot averaged 22.9 mL. All radiographic im-ages were obtained within an average of 97 secondspost-infusion. Horses with increased sole depthhad improved detail of the terminal papillae. Four-teen feet had decreased contrast in the dorsal lamel-lar vessels on the early weight-bearing view, butcontrast returned to this region when viewed on theunweighted lateral. 4. Discussion Variation in the venographic pattern can be relatedto hoof conformation and weight-bearing; however,full assessments can be views areobtained.

Anderson, DVM A poorly tting saddle can affect a horse's performance and behavior. Evaluation of a saddle andback provides valuable information helping determine whether the saddle is a contributing source ofback pain.

Introduction The saddle is the interface between the rider andhorse. This connection should allow the rider tofeel and communicate with the horse and the horseto move in a well-balanced way without inhibitingthoracolumbar, scapular, or cervical movement.The saddle must t well for a horse to advance inits training and become progressively stronger. Numerous studies have been published showing the effects of saddles on the horse. Ill-tting sad-dles have been shown to negatively affect the horse'squality of gait, back movement, muscular develop-ment, and performance, and cause thoracolumbarpain. 1,2Studies have been performed evaluating the amount of pressure created by ill-tting saddlesnecessary to cause back soreness. 3As practitioners we have all witnessed poor performance or behaviordue to an ill-tting saddle and observed focal swell-ing or palpated areas of soreness under the saddle. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a static examination of the saddle and horse to helpthe practitioner determine whether a saddle is caus-ing back pain. Although the examination will helpto determine whether a saddle ts, proper saddlettings are a more complicated matter. A completesaddle tting should include observation of the rider on the horse in motion as well. There are manyopinions as to what is the most objective way todetermine saddle t. The literature advocates theuse of saddle pressure measurement devices butother research has also included optical motion cam-eras, force-measuring treadmills, inertial measure-ment of body motion, 4and electromyography (EMG).5 2. Materials and Methods The initial examination is performed with the horsestanding squarely and without a saddle pad. Thesaddle is placed caudal to the scapulae so that thecaudal excursion of the scapula during front legextension would not interfere with the saddle. Thisis typically 3-5 cm caudal to the scapulae. Level A saddle is level when the deepest point of the seatis horizontal with the ground. The deepest point isapproximately the center of the saddle from cranialto caudal (Fig. 1). Level is not necessarily when thepommel and the cantle are at the same height. A tree that is too narrow for the wither will cause an uphill appearance of the saddle (Fig. 2). Less AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 301LAMENESS NOTEScommonly, a very prominent wither or lordosis cancause a similar appearance. An uphill saddle willcause more of the rider's weight to be distributed inthe caudal third of the saddle, 6thus leading to sore - ness in this area. Conversely, a saddle with too wide of a tree will tilt forward causing a downhill appearance (Fig. 3).In this orientation the saddle is not supportive of therider's forward motion. The result is higher pres-sure and discomfort at the base of the wither andoften on midline over the spinous processes. 7A wide tree can also cause the points of the tree or the flap to apply pressure to the caudal aspect of thescapulae. This can lead to restriction of the scapu-lar motion and decreased forelimb protraction. Caudal to Cranial Rocking The cranial to caudal stability of the saddle can beassessed by placing one hand on the pommel and oneon the cantle and applying alternating pressure.Ideally, there should be minimal movement. If thesaddle rocks forward and back it is a sign the tree istoo wide or the panels are too curved. If this is thecase there is usually a lack of contact at the rear ofthe saddle. When the tree is too wide the rocking action cre- ates a pivot point that is typically on the midline andextends laterally to the base of the wither. This area often demonstrates swelling and sensitivity. If the panels are too curved, the rocking action causes pressure in the mid-to-lower thoracic areaunder the center third of the saddle. This usuallycauses soreness on either side of midline where thepanels contact. Pommel Clearance There should be clearance between the wither andthe pommel. The amount of clearance varieswith the type of saddle and conformation of thewither. The clearance can be examined with therider's weight in the saddle as well as on staticexamination. Contact of the pommel with the wither can cause signs of mild bruising to ulceration of the dermisdepending on the degree of pressure. Contact be-tween the tree and the wither is usually caused by atree that is too wide. Contact Between the Wither and the Tree The contact between the wither and the tree shouldbe evaluated on both sides of the horse. Ideally, thecontact should be over a broad surface area withoutareas of focal pressure. The contact can be as-sessed by placing a hand between the wither andtree to determine whether the contact is consistent(Fig. 4). There is typically 4-5 inches of contactfrom dorsal to ventral. If the majority of contact isin a focal area near the dorsal aspect of the wither,the tree is typically too wide. 6If the greatest con - tact is lower on the tree, it is too narrow (Fig. 5).It is important to extend the hand caudally to eval-uate the contact in the caudal tree. Contact Between the Panel and the Back Examining the contact between the panel and thehorse's back is important in determining whetherthere are areas of excessive pressure. The proce-dure is performed on both sides of the horse. Onthe left side of the horse, the left hand places pres-sure on a central point on the top of the saddle and Fig. 3. A saddle tilting forward or downhill due to a wide tree.Notice the space between the caudal aspect of the panel and theback. Fig. 1. A level saddle. Fig. 2. A saddle tilted back or uphill due to a narrow tree.302 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLAMENESSthe right hand is placed between the panel and thehorse's back. The right hand starts cranially at thelevel of the tree and moves caudally (Fig. 6). Thecontact of the panel with the horse should be over abroad surface area with even pressure from witherto cantle. This should be repeated several times toobtain a consistent evaluation. The contact between the panel and the back is an assessment that becomes easier with experience.The goal is to notice specic pressure points, bulgesin the panel, and areas that lack contact (Table 1).When performed properly there should be good cor-relation with computerized pressure sensors. 7 Examination of the Back Under the Saddle If the horse has been ridden regularly and recentlywith the saddle being evaluated, examination of theback for patterns of pain, swelling, rubbed hair, and coat and skin abnormalities is helpful. Saddleproblems found in the initial part of the evaluationwill correlate with these ndings. Palpation of the back under the area contacted by the saddle should be performed with rm digitalpalpation or with an instrument such as a needlecap. A typical painful response secondary to pres-sure points from a saddle is to move away from thepressure and/or show excessive muscle contraction.The responses vary with the sensitivity of the horse.The pressure applied may need to be varied accord-ingly. As with any examination, the more of themyou perform, the easier interpretation becomes. The examination starts with palpation of the dor- sal and caudal aspects of the scapula. Pressure isapplied to the midline over the dorsal spinous pro-cesses and is best done with digital pressure ratherthan with a rm object. Palpation of the area un- Fig. 4.

Soreness under the saddle can be hard to interpret when there is generalized discomfort. Pain underthe saddle can potentially be caused by problemsother than an ill-tting saddle. Ideally, the exam-iner is looking for focal patterns of soreness, oftenbilaterally, that correlate with saddle problemsfound earlier in the examination (Figs. 7-11). 3. Results Saddle evaluation has proven benecial to the prac-tice as an additional service we can offer, contributesvaluable information when evaluating sore backs, and can help the client with decision making withregard to their saddle. We are often asked to evaluate saddles when a horse exhibits signs of not wanting to be tacked, coldback, behavioral problems when ridden, obviousback pain when ridden or groomed, atrophy of backmuscles, swelling under the saddle, or hair follicledamage. We performed fty saddle examinations in 2015. The horses examined were show hunters and jump-ers. The ndings of the examination are summa-Table 1.

The second column refers tosaddles without the negative qualities describedabove. Twenty of the horses examined by palpation ex- hibited soreness related to ill-tting saddles. Fiveof these horses exhibited signs such as aversion tobeing tacked, dropping when mounted, and misbe-having when ridden due to back pain. One horsewas obviously lame due to pressure of the saddle onthe caudal aspect of the scapulae. When the saddlewas removed the lameness was no longer present. 4. Discussion When evaluating a horse with a sore back it is im-portant to realize there is often more than one areaof discomfort or cause of pain. A poorly tting sad-dle can be the primary cause or an additional sourceof soreness. An examination of the whole back,lameness evaluation, and other diagnostics are oftennecessary to completely assess a sore back. A complete saddle tting includes additional steps beyond the evaluation described in this paper.Ideally, this should be performed by a professionalsaddle tter or a veterinarian with a great deal ofexperience in saddle tting. There are many nu-ances involved in appraising whether a horse andrider will be comfortable and perform well with asaddle.There are important topics involving saddle t beyond the scope of this paper. Saddle pads caneffect whether a saddle ts well or poorly. If asaddle ts well minimal padding is necessary. Ex-cessive padding applied to a proper tting saddlecan be a source of pain. Padding can improve thet of a saddle when minor changes are needed butwill not improve a poorly tting saddle. 8The ma - terials they are composed of can also improve theload on a horse's back. 9 The evaluation of a saddle may need to be per- formed periodically. Saddles change with use, es-pecially if employed on multiple horses. If thesaddle is wool flocked it will need to be reflockedwith use. A saddle that ts a horse well at one timecan eventually t poorly due to changing back con-formation with age or atrophy. As a horse's mus-culature develops with age and exercise, the saddlemay need to change. 2 The saddle has a great effect on the comfort and performance of the horse. Evaluation of the saddleallows the examiner to insure the saddle is not asource of pain.

Introduction Early diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis is im-portant. Synovial fluid analysis is the best means toestablish a diagnosis; however, in some situations resultsof analyses (total nucleated cell count [TNCC], total pro-tein (TP), color, etc.) can be inconsistent or are not avail-able rapidly (e.g., culture). The goal of this study was toevaluate synovial L-lactate concentrations in horses withnaturally occurring septic and nonseptic arthritis using aportable lactate reader. 2. Methods Adult horses ( /H110222 y) presenting to a referral hospital in South Florida with potential septic arthritis of one limbwere included. Total nucleated cell count, TP (g/dL),and lactate (mmol/L) were recorded and statistical anal-ysis used to evaluate factors associated with lactate.Septic arthritis was conrmed if TNCC both clinical and cytological ndings. 3. Results All horses with septic arthritis had elevated lactatecompared with nonseptic arthritis. Prior joint injec-tion and increased duration of time prior to referral did not cause statistically signicant elevations in lactate. 4. Discussion The lactate reader used in this study is a cost-effective, portable unit that can provide stall-sideevaluation of synovial lactate. Based on the resultsof the current study, the use of synovial lactateseems justied; however, the authors recommendthat other TP) arealways performed. following intra-ar-ticular corticosteroid (methylprednisolone), this wasnot seen in the current study; most horsesreceived a different corticosteroid or a blood-derivedproduct.

Introduction Infectious diseases include those caused by variouspathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites.Not all infectious diseases are contagious. For ex-ample, West Nile virus (WNV) causes an infection inhorses but is not spread from horse to horse (infec-tious but not contagious). Instead, horses are in-fected with WNV by the bite of a mosquito carryingthe virus. Infectious diseases can endanger thewellbeing of horses and the people who work withthem, at least for some diseases such as rabies andsalmonellosis. Equine infectious diseases can have devastating nancial and emotional effects on horse owners andthose who make a living in the equine industry.Depending on the disease situation, effects can in-clude: Temporary or permanent loss of use Death of affected horses Restrictions on the movement of diseased and exposed horsesCosts associated with treating affected horses Associated costs of implementing biosecurity procedures or other preventive measures. 2. Infection Control An infection-control plan should take into accountthe level of disease risk, the risk aversion of stake-holders and, for some diseases, the standards set byrules and regulations of the State Animal HealthOfcial, United States Department of Agriculture -Animal Plant Health Inspection Service - VeterinaryServices (USDA-APHIS-VS), or ofcials hosting anequine event. Every equine facility or equine population is unique, and even though overarching general prin-ciples for infection control apply across all facilitiesand various equine populations, each equine opera-tion should tailor a biosecurity program specicallydesigned for their equine population or facility.Biosecurity practices for controlling infection areonly as effective as the weakest link in their imple-mentation. For example, if nine of 10 equine care 312 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT NOTESproviders wash their hands when moving betweensegregated horses, the one provider who does notcan introduce or spread pathogens, even though theother nine did the right thing. In the past 20 years, outbreaks of equine infec- tious diseases have had major effect on the healthof individual horses and the equine industry.These outbreaks led to the development of strate-gies for preventing some infectious disease out-breaks and for optimizing containment efforts fordiseases that cannot be prevented. Options forcontrolling infectious diseases can be placed intotwo broad categories: actions that reduce therisk of exposing horses to pathogens and actionsthat optimize resistance to infection or disease.Advances have occurred in both categories duringthe last 20 years. 3. Personal Interest in Infectious Disease In 1996, an outbreak of Salmonella Infantis at Col- orado State University's Veterinary Teaching Hos-pital's (CSU-VTH) Large Animal Clinic 1led to my interest in biosecurity. Although I had an interest in the clinical and research aspects of infectiousdiseases before this outbreak, I had never beforeused the terms \"biosecurity\" or \"critical controlpoints,\" nor had I recognized that the \"devil was inthe details\" when mitigating or preventing a conta-gious disease outbreak. Our efforts to resolve this outbreak provided my colleagues and me at CSU-VTH with many valuableinsights. Those of us involved in the outbreak mit-igation published manuscripts that included themany lessons learned; subsequently, the Universityhired a director of biosecurity. We continued toconduct multiple research projects related to infec-tion control to develop a science-based biosecuritystandard operating plan for CSU-VTH (available athttp://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/Documents/biosecurity-sop.pdf). 4. Options for Infection Control Administering vaccines optimizes resistance to in-fection for at-risk equine. Recently, new licensedvaccines have been developed for equine diseases forwhich there was no vaccine available. For exam-ple, WNV was rst recognized in the United Statesin 1999. By summer 2001, a conditionally licensed vaccine was available for immunizing U.S. equidsagainst WNV. Subsequently, new vaccine tech-nology that had never been used in the productionof equine vaccines was implemented to developvaccine products for controlling WNV in equine.Examples of other relatively new vaccines forequine include vaccines for controlling rhinitis vi-rus, pigeon fever, and leptospirosis. Equine veterinary practitioners are expected to play a pivotal role in preventing, investigating, andmitigating infectious-disease outbreaks. Today,equine veterinarians face sophisticated, oftendaunting challenges. To effectively prepare andplan for a disease outbreak, veterinarians must have a good understanding of modern resources andstrategies. In addition, veterinarians must havethe trust and nancial support of owners, farm man-agers, and event organizers. Based on its scope, effect on business continuity, and the effect it had on infected horses, the multi-state outbreak of equine herpesvirus myeloencepha-lopathy (EHM) in 2011 was a game changer for theequine industry. Today, the equine industry seemsto be interested in investing more time and money todevelop comprehensive plans that address some con-trollable equine diseases. 5. Role of Veterinary Practitioners in Infection Control An equine practitioner is likely the rst person anequine owner calls when a horse is sick, which usu-ally puts the practitioner rst on site and creates anopportunity for him or her to play a role in thediagnosis and containment of a contagious disease.Equine veterinarians who work at equine events orsales facilities could also play a role in developing specic protocols that reduce the risk of disease in-troduction. In the case of a potential disease out-break, the initial actions of the equine practitionercan have a major effect in preventing the spread ofthe disease. If faced with a potential outbreak, it isimportant that the equine practitioner determinewhether he or she has the authority to direct thecontrol of the outbreak and whether he or she isobligated to report the situation to veterinary regu-lators. Depending on the scope and type of out-break, a practitioner may want to consider involvinga team of people with expertise in areas such asdiagnostic laboratory testing, epidemiology, biosecu-rity, and pathology. Equine practitioners have a role in developing detailed vaccination plans for their clients' horses.For example, a plan might call for the veterinarianto personally administer vaccines to their equinepatients, sell vaccines for clients to administer, oradvise clients on the most appropriate vaccines topurchase, thus leaving the administration of vac-cines to the client. Many practitioners have limitedtheir role in infection control to the oversight ofvaccinations, feeling that their expertise in devel-oping biosecurity protocols cannot be marketed.However, now could be an opportune time for vet-erinarians to expand their roles in reducing therisk of disease exposure for their equine patients. Implementing biosecurity methods that reduce the risk of exposing equine to infectious diseaseagents is more challenging than simply immunizingequine. Reducing the risk of exposure can fall intoseveral categories and is dependent on the diseaseagent, the signalment, the use and location of thehorses, and environmental factors. It is likely im-possible to eliminate all exposure risks, especiallyamong horses that commingle with horses from dif-ferent facilities or on operations where outside AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 313IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENThorses are introduced to the resident equinepopulation. Recent outbreaks have created more interest in biosecurity methods from equine owners and equineevent organizers. Thus, equine practitioners couldadvise equine owners on the methods of infectioncontrol beyond vaccination, such as those that re-duce the risk of exposing equine to infectious dis-ease agents at their home operation or while offthe home operation. In addition, by developing amarketing strategy for infection control beyondvaccination, veterinarians could expand theirpractice offerings and improve the health of theirequine patients. 6. Information Resources for Equine Veterinarians There is an ever-expanding library of equine text-books on biosecurity and specic equine For example, the second edition ofEquine Infectious Diseases 2has an entire chapter on biosecurity, 14 chapters on viral diseases, 19 on bacterial and rickettsial diseases, eight on fungaldiseases, and seven on parasitic diseases. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) developed guidelines for vaccinating horses.These guidelines provide exposure-risk categories aswell as specic recommendations for vaccinatingvarious categories of horses (e.g., foals, broodmares,and other adult horses; available at www.aaep.org). In addition, the AAEP has guidelines for infectioncontrol at equine events and for venereal disease.Infection-control guidelines at equine events provideequine practitioners with an action plan whenfaced with an equine infectious-disease outbreakand provide details regarding the clinical andlaboratory diagnostic aspects of selected equinediseases. The guidelines also include disease-prevention planning. The AAEP regularly re-views these guidelines. In Biosecurity atShows & at Home\" 3provides tips about educating clients and facility managers on implementingbiosecurity practices before a disease problemoccurs. The neurologic form of equine herpesvirus is of concern to equine owners, equine trainers, eventorganizers, and state animal health ofcials. TheU.S. Animal Health Association's (USAHA) Infec-tious Diseases of Horses Committee developed aguideline for managing EHM outbreaks (availableat http://www.usaha.org/). Although this guidelinewas primarily directed at state animal health of-cials, any veterinarian involved in the mitigationof an EHM outbreak will nd the information ofuse. This guideline has multiple sections includ-ing 1) diagnostic testing, 2) quarantine placement,3) quarantine release, 4) investigation and bios-ecurity measures, 5) incident communication, and6) vaccination.7. Information for Equine Owners The USDA-APHIS-VS has recently updated an in- formation sheet titled, \"Biosecurity Tips for EquineOwners,\" which gives general guidance on infectioncontrol. The sheet emphasizes key infection-con-trol points that equine owners should be aware ofand can be found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal-health/equine-health. An equine biosecurity risk calculator is available from Equine Guelph (University of Guelph). As itsname implies, this calculator enables equine ownersand farm managers to assess the risk of introducingdisease to their facility and provides educationalmaterials related to controlling equine infectious diseases. The calculator is available at http://www. equineguelph.ca/Tools/biosecurity.php. Other edu-cational materials on this Web site include biosecu-rity information presented via a whiteboard scribblevideo and interviews with equine trainers regardingtheir approach to infection control. The \"Equine Biosecurity Principles and Best Practices Guide,\" was developed by the Alberta Vet-erinary Medical Association and the Alberta Eques-trian Federation as a way to interactively educatehorse owners while encouraging discussions with aveterinarian regarding biosecurity on their facility.This tool is available at http://albertaequestrian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2014_biosecurity_book.pdf. In addition to Web sites, other media have re- cently featured stories about infection control, vac-cination, biosecurity, and specic equine infectiousdiseases. Many of these stories emphasize the im-portance of equine owners in working with theirveterinarian, because he or she is most familiar withthe owner's horses and the specics of the operation.This familiarity puts their veterinarian in the bestposition to develop a tailored vaccination and bios-ecurity plan. 8. Information for Equine Events or Venues The \"Horse Venue Biosecurity\" workbook, based onthe 2007 equine influenza outbreak in Australia,offers a self-assessment guide for all horse venues,including racetracks, shows, and boarding facilities(available at http://www.farmbiosecurity.com.au/livestock/horses/horse-venue-biosecurity-workbook/). The California Department of Food and Agricul- ture developed a biosecurity toolkit for equineevents. This toolkit has two main themes: waysto reduce the risk of introducing disease to an equineevent, and reducing the risk of spreading pathogensif an infectious disease occurs at an equine event.In addition, the toolkit's appendices includes mate-rials that support the implementation of variouspractices in the toolkit. The toolkit isavailable at The Colorado Department Agriculture's State Veterinarian's ofce has met with several equineevent organizers to review a template for a business 314 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTcontinuity plan for use at equine events.

The Horse magazine has featured a biosecurity tip-of-the-month on their Web site based on a bios-ecurity calendar developed by the California Depart-ment of Agriculture. Each month an importantequine biosecurity principle was highlighted. 9. Implementing of Biosecurity Measures Identifying facilities that can be used for isolation,whether to prevent disease introduction or to limitthe spread of disease, is an important part of bios-ecurity. Implementing effective isolation measuresrequires predetermined protocols and supplies.However, during some of the most important high-risk situations there is often no provision for isola-tion facilities nor the associated actions necessary toisolate a contagious disease in a timely and effectivemanner. Here are some key steps to take whenresponding to a suspected infectious disease situa-tion: 1. Do no harm. Do not rush into a stall until you have a plan. 2. Take biosecurity precautions to avoid worsen- ing the situation. 3. Communicate your ndings to the horse owner and event organizer (if the horse is at anevent when it becomes sick). At the same time,take appropriate actions to restrict the spread ofdisease. Initial biosecurity measures should beaimed at controlling a possible outbreak until youhave evidence conrming that no disease ispresent.Veterinarians should carry a biosecurity kit in theirvehicle with materials designed to reduce the likeli-hood of spreading contamination from horse tohorse. The biosecurity kit should contain examina-tion gloves (a pair for each horse to be examined),coveralls dedicated to each horse's examination or toa group of animals of equal disease status, a cover-ing for the upper body impervious to secretions suchas nasal discharge, plastic footwear covers, andsome kind of head covering. Once barrier precau-tions are removed, a disinfectant solution should beapplied to footwear soles after the plastic covers areremoved, and a supply of hand sanitizer or access tosoap and water should be available. Whether at a farm or an event center, it is important to ensure that there are adequate sup-plies on hand to implement biosecurity measures.Supplies include disinfectant, stall-cleaningequipment, feeding equipment and grooming sup-plies that can be dedicated to caring for isolatedhorses, barrier precaution supplies for personnel caring for isolated horses, and enough signage for1-2 days. To ensure that effective disease-control practices are implemented, veterinarians should have a con-versation with farm owners and event organizersabout how they plan to respond to a contagious-disease situation. For example, a plan that callsfor isolating conrmed contagious-disease caseswhile still caring for the animals can expedite thecontrol of disease spread. The Equine BiosecurityToolkit for Equine Events has information abouthow to set up a temporary isolation area, implementmovement restrictions within a facility, use barrierprecautions, and determine the likely level ofexposure. Veterinarians that work for an equine event are in an ideal position to implement a plan to reduce therisk of disease introduction, should a contagious dis-ease occur at the event. If equine practitioners arein charge of biosecurity during an outbreak situa-tion, it is important that they personally observehow and if people are following biosecurity recom-mendations. If necessary, veterinarians shouldphysically show event personnel exactly how to fol-low isolation and similar protocols. Do not assumethat oral or signage instructions will be obvious.It is also important that veterinarians set the stan-dard through their own behavior, and that theynever take shortcuts when performing biosecurityprotocols. Veterinary textbooks have entire chapters about biosecurity, which can serve as a resource for equinepractitioners as they serve their clients. 2 10. Role of Veterinarian in Making a Diagnosis History and physical ndings should be consideredwhen assessing equine infectious-disease status.These ndings should dictate the required diagnos-tic testing. Collecting diagnostic samples, selectingdiagnostic tests, and interpreting test results will bedescribed in detail in other parts of this in-depthsession. In addition, risk aversion and what is atstake are important factors to consider when mak-ing the decision to run tests. A key take-home mes-sage is to not run tests without rst determininghow you will use and communicate the results.Optimal sample collection and shipping are as im-portant as testing. Identify laboratories and theirrespective testing capabilities before you need them.Some laboratories are able to offer a wide array ofdiagnostic testing by forwarding received samples toother laboratories. In time-sensitive situations, di-agnostic test results can be expedited by submittingsamples directly to the laboratory performing thetest. Laboratory personnel can help you determinethe most appropriate samples to collect, discussavailable test formats, designate how you want toreceive the results, and establish a likely timeframefor receiving results. It does make a differencewhich disease agent is causing an outbreak; for AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 315IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTexample, a response to an influenza outbreak willbe different than a response to an EHM outbreak.Thus, performing diagnostic testing combinedwith physical ndings are critical in developingthe most effective control strategies and arealso important in providing communication aboutthe outbreak. The AAEP \"Guidelines for Manag-ing Infectious Disease Outbreaks\" can assistequine practitioners to develop disease-specicrecommendations. These guidelines can be foundat http://aaep.org/info/guidelines-50. Certain suspect or conrmed diseases are report- able to state animal health ofcials and/or to USDA-APHIS-VS. It is important that veterinariansknow what their reporting responsibilities are intheir state and act accordingly. In this in-depthsession, we will discuss how state animal healthofcials interact with USDA-APHIS-VS to respondto equine infectious disease situations. When indoubt about infectious diseases, equine practitionersshould contact their state animal health ofcial todetermine the steps to take next. 11. Role of Veterinarians in Communication Effective communication is imperative for control-ling an outbreak response and for ensuring the con-dence of managers, owners, and the public.Effective communication can be as simple as talkingto a manager/owner on a daily basis, posting newsreleases around major show grounds, and keepingthe media informed. Training on how best to inter-act with media is advisable if an equine practitioneris going to act as a spokesperson for an equine eventor farm. The important thing is to dene the mes-sage and determine how to get it across in an unam-biguous way. It is also important to stay focused onthe facts, remain professional, and indicate what stepsare being taken to deal with the incident at hand.Never announce a disaster until you know what stepsare being taken to deal with the situation. Daily updates\u2014even if no change in the situation has occurred\u2014help to keep concerned parties up todate and establish condence in the person or entityproviding the updates. However, do not make aprediction as to the nal outcome of a disease out-break, even if your experience would allow you to doso. It is often best to plan for a worse-case scenariountil the outbreak is under control and going to staythat way. 12. Options for Veterinarians in Marketing and Implementing an Infection-Control Program A very important rst step in marketing an infec-tion-control program is for the veterinarian to set agood hygiene example while at an equine operationor event. Veterinarians should practice good handhygiene while working between groups of horses,and wear clean outerwear and footwear when mov-ing between segregated groups of horses on a singleoperation or when moving between operations.Some farms may require veterinarians to sanitizetheir footwear, and some might offer outerwear ded- icated for use on their operation. These requestsshould be readily accepted by veterinarians. In ad-dition, Veterinarians should always use clean equip-ment and have their vehicles cleaned regularly.Contaminated steering wheels, handles on veteri-nary boxes, and vehicle floor mats can be vectors fordisease spread. To help sell their management services, equine veterinarians should educate current and potentialclients about the effectiveness of their services andestablish marketing strategies by illustrating theirpotential value. Equine veterinarians can providemanagement programs designed to prevent andcontrol infectious diseases. Boarding farms,training facilities, veterinary practices, equineevent facilities, event organizers, even small pri-vate horse farms can benet from these programs.An article on how best to educate clients and fa-cility managers is available in a special issue of\"EquiManagement.\" 3 In a recent survey of the horse-competition indus- try, 80-90% of respondents indicated that they hadused the Internet in the previous 6 months for horse-care information; however, the Internet was not thepreferred source of information. 4The top three preferred sources of information regarding horse health care were veterinarians (93% of respon-dents), farriers (77%) and trainers (68%). 4 By providing diagnosis and treatment services, veterinarians can tailor prevention and interventionplans for a farm's or an event's population of horses.Veterinarians can do this by recommending tradi-tional vaccination- and parasite-control programsand products, and by advising their clients on otheraspects of infection control (e.g., early detection ofdisease, early intervention if an outbreak occurs,reduction of exposure risk, and other means of en-hancing specic and nonspecic resistance [immu-nity] to disease). Veterinarians should consider providing services for the following: Mitigating an ongoing infectious disease situ- ation (outbreak or endemic disease) in horseson the facility Managing an imminent threat of infectious disease, while maintaining some level of busi-ness continuity Facilitating forward planning with the goal of /H18546Ensuring the well-being of horses /H18546Improving owner/trainer/manager satisfaction /H18546Maintaining business continuity (quaran- tines will cause loss of business continuity) /H18546Enabling competitive advantage (busi- nesses with programs become the stan-dard to which other businesses comparethemselves) /H18546Reducing a facility's risk of liability. 316 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTEducating clients about the potential ramicationsof an infectious disease outbreak can be an effectivemarketing tool. Ramications can range from thesuffering and loss of affected animals to facility-wideeffects due to disease or quarantine. Making thesepoints with decision makers can motivate them towrite well-designed disease-prevention programs. Certain pathogens can remain in horses even af- ter they recover. These persistent infections canforce restrictions on how the affected horses can beused. For example, horses that persistently shedSalmonella sp. or Streptococcus equi equi might have to remain separated from other horses and/ormight be prohibited from boarding facilities, untilshedding of these pathogens has ceased. An infection-control program's components de- pend on the equine population and type facility forwhich it was designed. Specically, it is based onthe lifestyle of the horses. For example, a controlprogram for horses that live a relatively isolatedexistence on a remote ranch will be different thanone for horses that regularly travel to events. Certainly, it is important to include vaccination as a part of an infection-control program, but clientsshould be informed that administering a vaccinedoes not prevent all infections. In other words,simply vaccinating does not make for a comprehen-sive infectious-disease control program. Ideally, veterinarians should conduct an evalua- tion by walking through the facility with the owner/ manager. This walkthrough\u2014along with inquiriesabout the demographics of the horse population, trafcflow on the operation, and existing equine health man-agement\u2014enables the veterinarians to identify themany ways horses could be exposed to infectious dis-ease agents. Potential exposure risks include thefollowing: Other horses (those that frequent equine events, new arrivals, visiting horses). Other types of animals (wild animals, other livestock, birds, and rodents). Environmental factors (feed, water, bedding, stabling, trailers, insects, ticks, airborne). People and objects traveling on/with them (horse caretakers, stall cleaners, veterinari-ans, farriers, and their clothing, equipment,footwear, and vehicles, etc.). During the walkthrough, veterinarians should view horses as they move through the facilityand pay special attention to the protocols forarrival and departure areas, stabling, and wa-ter and feed sources. Make note of any differ-ence between what owners/managers havedescribed as their infection-control techniquesand what actually occurs on the opera-tion. For instance, when an event organizercites a facility as having separate pens forhorses, they might be thinking of separationthat prevents injury, not separation for infec-tion prevention. Yes, the horses might beseparated and thus unable to injure one an- other, but they still share an air space and/orcan touch noses through gaps in fencing, sharea water source and, thus, spread disease. Following human trafc patterns during an on-site evaluation is also important. For ex-ample, during a disease outbreak at a racingfacility, trainers from several barns congre-gated for coffee in a quarantined barn aftermorning workouts, not realizing that move-ment restrictions pertained to them as well asto the horses. In another example, a facility had quarantined all equine other than racetrack ponies (mountsused to lead racehorses to the track) and wereletting the ponies come and go from the quar-antined barns. In this case, apparently train-ers were unaware that the movementrestrictions applied to the ponies and to theracehorses. These examples illustrate thataddressing the details of equine and humanmovement is very important when designing acontrol program. It is also important that veterinarians inter- view the people who provide horses withhands-on care (not just the facility manager)about their care practices. These interviewsare the only way to obtain details related totheir processes for horse care and, thus, veryimportant in both outbreak mitigation andplan development. During a walkthrough, veterinarians should create a report based on a predeterminedchecklist. In addition, photographs should betaken illustrating detailed recommendationsspecic to each operation. After completion,veterinarians should review the report withthe facility manager or equine owner and workon a timeline for implementing agreed-uponprocedures. Consider dividing recommenda-tions into categories. For example, separaterecommendations that can be done immedi-ately from actions that take longer to imple-ment. While reviewing short-term and long- term recommendations with the manager orowner, emphasize that he or she must maketheir own cost-benet decisions, based on risk-aversion vs costs of implementing the proposedrecommendations. Keep in mind, treatmentscost money, take time, and can cause distress inhorses. For example, some horses develop be-havior problems when given oral medications orinjections, which can undo months of train-ing. In addition, adverse reactions to drugs,such as antibiotics associated with diarrhea, canpromote antibiotic resistance in pathogens. It is also important that veterinarians be pre- pared for an infectious disease outbreak. Forexample, if a veterinarian happened to be on acall 30 miles from his or her ofce when asked toinvestigate a potential case of infectious/conta- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 317IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTgious disease, they should already be equipped with the necessary tools to implement barrierprecautions, such as disposable outerwear. Asmentioned previously, keeping a biosecurity kitin the practice vehicle is a good idea. Despite best-laid plans for high-risk groups of horses, infectious/contagious disease will occur;however, with adequate preplanning and an ac-tion plan, risks and response times can bereduced.

J Equine Vet Sci 2016;37:58-62. 318 2016 PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTEquine Infectious Author's Control, Ontario Veterinary Col- lege Health Sciences Infectious gastrointestinal (GI) disease is a commonand potentially devastating problem in horses.Most commonly manifested as diarrhea with vary-ing degrees of systemic illness, and prone to compli-cations such as laminitis and venous thrombosis, itcan be frustrating to manage because of the myriadpotential causes, difculties in making a denitivediagnosis, difculties even determining whether aninfectious cause is present, and limited availabilityof objective information about optimal managementand preventive practices. The incidence of infectious GI disease is not well understood. This is largely because of a lack ofadequate study, but is confounded by difcultiesdening and diagnosing infectious GI disease and alack of centralized reporting of data on equine infec-tious GI disease. Even when diagnoses are made,most causes of enteric disease are not reportable toveterinary regulatory authorities and therefore,there is little or no compilation of case information.Collection of data from laboratories about specicpathogens identied (e.g., isolation of Salmonella ) can provide some insight, but even those data arelimited because of the small percentage of affectedhorses that are tested and common problemswith test sensitivity. Ultimately, a large percent- age of cases (a majority in most regions) 1,2are undiagnosed. The spectrum of disease is variable, ranging from inapparent to rapidly fatal, involving a single horseoccurring as sporadic cases to widespread and dev-astating herd outbreaks. The potential severity ofdisease (especially adult horses with acute colitis)and the potential for outbreaks that require promptintervention (e.g., outbreaks in foals, contaminatedfeed-associated disease) mean that a rapid and ef-fective response can be critical. 2. Etiologies Important etiologies are outlined in Table 1. Thisis not an exhaustive list given that some pathogensthat are rare or poorly characterized causes of GIdisease are not included. It is also almost certainthat other viral, parasitic, or bacterial causes ofdisease exist but have not been identied. It is important to remember that noninfectious causes of diarrhea and colitis occur. This wouldinclude nutritional causes, water quality (e.g., excessivesulfate). 3-7Antimicrobial drug use-associated disease, whether as a response to therapeutic ad- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 319IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT NOTESministration of antimicrobials8or ingestion of con - taminated feed,9is an important problem in the horse, but whether this is from individual pathogensor a more general state of \"dysbiosis\" is hard todene. The gut microbiota is a highly complex, di-verse, and critically important microbial commu-nity. It is increasingly clear that the microbiotacomposition has great influences on health and dis-ease in horses and other species. Although the fo-cus in equine infectious GI disease has been onindividual pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Clostridium difcile ), it is likely (if not certain) that changes in the overall microbial community composition canresult in disease. Antimicrobial drugs are probablythe best dened modiers of the gut microbiota, 10,11 but various other factors can presumably also influ-ence the microbiota and development of disease. 3. Farm and Horse History Investigation of any disease requires a thoroughhistory. When dealing with a suspect GI infectiousdisease, history pertaining to the affected horse, thefarm, recent transport, and/or exposure to outsidehorses at equine events is required. Important as-pects are outlined in Table 2.4. Initial Data Collection Understanding a problem is critical for proper inter- vention.12Although understanding of the problem will evolve over time, as more information becomes available and the situation itself evolves, promptcollection of basic clinical, farm, and epidemiologicaldata are necessary to put the problem into contextand to help determine what initial actions should betaken. Identication of even a single case of potentially infectious GI disease should trigger some basic in-formation gathering to determine whether other af-fected horses may be present on the property orwhether there are risks that further cases coulddevelop. This can be complicated in some situa- tions in which multiple owners and veterinariansare involved, but at a minimum, communicationwith facility personnel about the need to ensure noother horses are affected, should be performed. When it is apparent that multiple horses might be affected, accurate information must be gatheredpromptly. This allows for determination of thescope of the problem, the number of horses affectedand their locations. This also allows for identica-Table 1.

Thus, an initial step is gathering basicdata, particularly the numerator (sick horses) anddenominator (total number of horses at risk), bothoverall (entire farm) and for individual groups (e.g.,individual barns, turnout groups, or other poten-tially distinct populations). This can range fromvery easy to very difcult to do, depending on thesize, management, and record keeping at the facil-ity. For example, a small farm with one ownermakes gathering this information simple. A largefarm with a dynamic population of horses from dif-ferent owners traveling to different events can bemore challenging. Requesting the facility to desig-nate a liaison or point of contact who will assist theveterinarian with collection of these data can becritical. In addition to numerator and denominator data, a variety of other data are important, including loca-tion of infected animals, co-mingling groups, poten-tial sources of cross exposure (equipment,environment, personnel) and feed types, and sourcesand delivery dates. Routine infection control and biosecurity prac- tices, including routine isolation, cleaning and dis-infection practices, movement patterns, cohorting,pasture/paddock management, and a range of otherbasic management practices should be queried toidentify potential gaps, both for control of the ongo-ing problem and for future infection controlstrategies. 5. Initial Response The initial response is independent of the diagnosisor data collected above, and must be initiated imme-diately. It is critical to initiate an appropriate re-sponse as soon as a potential problem is identied.Although there may be some differences in manage-ment of disease caused by different pathogens, thecore of the infection control approach is the same formost GI pathogens and general measures should beimplemented until a diagnosis is made. It is pref-erable to act quickly and aggressively at the start, with the ability to reduce to less stringent controlprotocols as appropriate over time. The rst response to a potential infectious GI dis- ease is to separate the clinically affected horse(s)from the rest of the herd. This consists of bothphysical and procedural separation. This can be ina dedicated isolation stall, in a stall as far from otherstalls/horse housing areas as possible or a separatepasture or paddock. In all circumstances, proce-dures must be put in place to reduce transmission ofpathogens by personnel, fomites, or other animals(e.g., personal protective equipment, dedicated wa-ter buckets, feed tubs, and other equipment neededfor the care of affected horses, limiting contact,working on affected horses last). In general, phys-ical separation is more readily implemented thanprocedural separation, but both approaches shouldbe used (e.g., as much physical separation as possi-ble, combined with procedures to reduce any poten-tial cross contamination). Another early step is cohorting. This involves separation of groups of different risk statuses.Typically, this involves separation of diseased, ex-posed, and (hopefully) unexposed horses. Thesegroups should be physically and procedurally sepa-rated from each other. Within the diseased andexposed groups, individual isolation is ideal. Indi-vidual isolation of unexposed groups, or formingsmall groups within the unexposed group, is alsoideal, given that it can help contain any pathogenspread should one of the horses deemed unexposedactually be infectious. This is a potential risk be-cause identication of these groups can be difcult,especially early in the process. In general, it is bestto default to the highest risk group that is reason-able (e.g., if there is some concern a horse mighthave been exposed, consider it in the exposed group).Horses in the exposed and unexposed groups shouldbe monitored closely for development of disease (e.g.fever, diarrhea, anorexia), because of the potentialfor incorrect group assignment. Once initial containment has been established and treatment of sick horses is underway, the infec-Table 2.

Complete de-scription of the outbreak response is beyond thescope of this document, but some important areasare discussed below. If there is any likelihood that feed contamination is involved, the feed source should be switched asquickly as possible until contamination has beenruled out. 6. Investigation Team Although uncommonly used apart from large or highprole outbreaks, establishment of an investigationor outbreak team is a useful response. This cangather all the relevant expertise and engage rele-vant stakeholders to optimize information gather-ing, communication, and outbreak response. Theoutbreak team can take various forms, depending onthe situation, such as a group that formally meets inperson on a regular basis throughout the outbreak,an ad-hoc team that discusses issues as needed, or agroup that comes together virtually through elec-tronic communications or participation in confer-ence calls. It is important that all stakeholdergroups have a member involved (e.g., in a boardingfacility, that might be the farm owner, a represen-tative of boarders, a representative of farm staff,and one or more veterinary personnel). Ideally, anexpert in infectious diseases, and infection control isinvolved, either on site or for external consultation.A key concept is getting the help that is needed anddoing that as early in the process as possible. 7. Diagnostic Testing Although identication of the cause is not needed forimplementation of an effective response, knowingthe cause as early as possible is ideal. This cansometimes help identify specic treatments and spe-cic infection control needs. It can also help iden-tify potential sources of infection and zoonoticdisease risks, and provide a basis for microbiologicalsurveillance (e.g. Salmonella screening of exposed horses). Another benet that cannot be overlookedincludes putting a specic name to the problem;something that can help affected individuals dealwith a stressful situation and allow them to readmore on the topic from reliable sources such as theEquine Disease Communication Center (available athttp://www.equinediseasecc.org). Although identication of the cause may be simple in some situations, it is not always straightforward.A number of factors may inhibit successful testing,which are listed below: Cost In the absence of a rare situation in which there isgovernment intervention, covering the cost of diag-nostic testing is almost always the responsibility ofowners or the farm. Testing can be expensive, par-ticularly when multiple tests or serial testing isrequired. It is not uncommon to have situations inwhich testing cannot be performed or incompletetesting is performed (e.g., not testing as often as needed, only testing a subset of the horses becausesome owners refuse). Interpretation of Results Many pathogens that cause disease (including out-breaks) can also be found in healthy horses. A planmust be made prior to testing for how to deal withthe various potential results. Testing of healthyhorses can be useful in an outbreak response if thosehorses are deemed at risk of transmission and theyare handled differently from negative horses. Thatis not always the case. Further, some diagnostictests should not be performed on nondiarrheic feces(e.g., C. difcile ELISA), limiting the range of test- ing that can be performed. Test Accuracy Performance of diagnostic tests can be variable, withsensitivity, and specicity varying greatly betweentypes of tests (e.g., culture vs polymerase chin reac-tion [PCR]), between tests of the same type (e.g.,different ELISA kits), and between laboratories.Understanding the performance characteristics ofany tests that are used is important to put the re-sults into proper context. This can be difcult forsome tests in which such data are not readilyavailable. Biological Relevance of Tests Some tests that are available have limited likelihoodof providing useful information and may simply con-fuse the situation. For example, Clostridium per- fringens is a common commensal, 13and can overgrow quickly in response to (as opposed to being the cause of disease) enteric disease. Therefore,tests that identify this bacterium, or alpha toxingene, a gene that is present in all types of C. perfringens and which is likely of little to no clinical consequence, can provide limited informa-tion. Some strains of C. perfringens may be rele- vant, and testing for beta, beta-2 toxin, netF 1,14-17) may be more relevant but are less commonly performed. When dealing with an outbreak, potential out- break, or concerning single disease event, choosingwhich horses to test is an important consideration.Affected horses are the highest priority given that itis from those cases that a diagnosis will most likelybe obtained. Testing of healthy individuals in theabsence of conrmation or strong suspicion of theprimary pathogen is highly questionable because ofthe overall low yield, associated cost, and difcultyinterpreting results in healthy horses. Thus, theinitial focus should be optimal testing (proper sam-ple collection, handling, and test selection) of af-fected horses, with the goal being reaching adiagnosis. Once a diagnosis is made or stronglysuspected, there can be consideration of broadeningthe scope of testing. This would involve a single 322 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTtest type or narrower range of tests, focused on thepresumptive pathogen, with the goal being identi-cation of subclinically affected animals (when therewould be a plan to manage these differently thanother animals on the facility). Exposed or poten-tially exposed animals are the highest priority, buttesting of all individuals on the farm is ideal, whenpossible, given that denition of exposed, and unex-posed can be difcult. This will be used for deci-sions about isolation, to help determine theepidemiology of disease on the farm and to evaluatecontainment measures. A variety of tests are available and choosing the optimal test or tests can be difcult because of thenumber of options, limited direct comparison be-tween tests, test performance characteristics, costs,and suspected pathogens. PCR testing is becomingmore widely available and has potential benets ofincreased sensitivity and specicity compared withbacterial culture or virus isolation test methods, andshort turnaround time. However, PCR also has thepotential to be poorly sensitive and specic, depend-ing on the quality of test design and performance.Understanding the test development, validation,and quality control practices used by chosen labora-tories is important because these can vary greatly.A potential downside of PCR is the inability to re-cover an organism for subsequent testing (some-thing that is most relevant with bacteria) and toconrm whether the pathogen is viable. Bacterialculture can provide an isolate for antimicrobial sus-ceptibility testing and for typing, which might berelevant for patient management and outbreak in-vestigation. Sometimes, combinations of PCR andculture may be useful, or a stepwise approach inwhich culture is performed on PCR-positive sam-ples, particularly if PCR is faster and moresensitive. PCR panels are increasingly available. These panels offer a range of diagnostic tests, 2typically at a substantially lower cost than running even a small number of individual tests. Advantages are theability to get results from a wide range of potentialpathogens at limited cost and more rapidly thanmoving through a sequential testing plan based on anegative initial single test. There may be disad-vantages when tests that are included are mini-mally informative or when pathogens of uncertainrelevance are included. It is important to recognizewhat PCR results mean. They suggest the pres-ence of nucleic acids from target sequence. Thisusually means there was a viable organism in thesample but highly sensitive assays might detecttransient passage of a microbe through the gut ornucleic acids from dead organisms. This may be oflimited concern but it is important to remember thatdiagnostic tests of any sort are just one step in thediagnostic process. They provide important infor-mation but are not denitive and must be inter-preted in the context of the affected horse, theaffected farm, the epidemiology of the agent, and other testing results. In recent years, assessment of the intestinal mi- crobiota has received much attention. The gut mi-crobiota is the complex microbial community in thegut, and there is increasing information implicating disturbances of this microbiota is associated withdisease. 18-20It is now possible to use next- generation sequence-based methods to identify thousands of bacteria within a fecal sample, some-thing that is impossible with culture-based methods.However, although it is clear that the microbiota isaltered in GI disease, 19this is not yet a reasonable diagnostic tool. Although microbiota assessment could suggest a microbiota that differs from mosthealthy horses, knowledge of the microbiota is notyet to the state where microbiota assessment canconrm a diagnosis. Some healthy horses have mi-crobiotas that would often be referred to as abnor-mal and some sick horses have unremarkablemicrobiotas. 19Therefore, microbiota testing can provide very useful information at the population level (e.g., comparing a group of diarrheic horses tothose with normal feces), it is not yet appropriate fordiagnosis of a specic disease. As knowledge ad-vances, analysis methods improve and turnaroundtime shortens, this may be a useful tool in thefuture. Testing of feces is the most common (and logical approach) in an outbreak of enteric disease. How-ever, testing of other specimens from the horsemaybe useful (e.g., blood for Neorickettsia risticii PCR). Other testing considerations include the fol-lowing: Hay: Hay should be examined for visible evi- dence of contamination (e.g., mold, toxic plants,animal feces). Pasture: Pasture should be investigated to identify any contaminants or toxic plants, withtesting for conrmation performed if indicated. Grain/concentrates: If a feed source is sus- pected as a cause of GI disease (e.g., antibioticcontamination), samples from different feedlots should be collected and tested. Supplements: If there is a potential link to supplements (or anything else a horse ingests),those should be tested. Water: Routine water testing can be per- formed, although bacterial limits applied tohuman drinking water do not necessarily ap-ply. Water testing is most likely to yield ananswer when specic testing is performed inresponse to a testing for a specic pathogen(e.g., Salmonella contamination of surface water). Environment: Environmental testing should be approached with caution. The equine en-vironment is not expected to be sterile and awide range of opportunistic pathogens can befound under normal circumstances. Identi- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 323IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTcation of the outbreak pathogen can be useful but also raises questions about relevanceand causality (e.g., does this just representexpected contamination from a known infectedhorse). Environmental testing must be per-formed in a targeted manner with a specicpathogen in mind and samples taken from asurface where results can be interpreted andacted upon (e.g., not from a stall currentlyhousing an infected horse). Environmentaltesting might be useful to identify an environ-mental source (when there is evidence suggest-ing that a specic site might be a problem), toidentify contamination that has evaded clean-ing and disinfection efforts (e.g., testing of astall that housed a horse with Salmonella after cleaning and disinfection, so that the stall canbe declared negative before it is used again). 21 Infection Control Practices on Site A rapid assessment of current practices and infec-tion control needs must be performed. A widerange of topics must be covered, and the approach tothese can vary greatly between outbreaks and facil-ities. Important areas to investigate and imple-ment are below: Personal hygiene (e.g., hand washing) Personal protective equipment (e.g., routine outerwear; enhanced practices such as gown,gloves, and footwear covers) Personnel movement Horse movement Equipment-handling practices (e.g., manage- ment of water buckets, sharing of tack or stallcleaning equipment and other items) Methods for cleaning and disinfection of equip- ment and horse housing areas Cohorting Isolation and care of affected horses Protocols for visitors Protocols for visiting personnel such as farri- ers, veterinarians, and feed suppliers Vehicle access and cleaning Pasture and paddock management Manure disposal Pest control Wildlife access 8. Farm Containment/Isolation Recommendations Specic aspects for implementation of a facility out-break response are highly variable. A range of fa-cility, disease, horse, regulatory, and logisticalchallenges may be present. It is often problematicto implement a strict infection control program,given that many standard equine practices are con-trary to basic infection control practice (e.g., fre-quent movement on and off the farm with mixingoutside horses, housing, or inconsistent grouping ofhorses when turned out). The economic effect ofmovement restrictions must be considered, but atthe same time, the potential effect of inadequately containing an outbreak must not be ignored. Thisis often an emotional and contentious area that hasto balance risk and benet. Veterinarians rarelyhave any authority to quarantine a facility, but reg-ulatory bodies (state, federal or provincial) may, de-pending on the disease and relevant legislation.Regulatory quarantine would be rare with GI dis-ease (as opposed to, for example, equine herpesvirus[EHV]-1), although it is possible in some jurisdic-tions. More often, decisions to stop horse move-ment and implement isolation protocols must bemade by facility owners/managers, given that theyare typically the ones with ultimate control of theequine management plan. This is complicated onfarms where multiple owners board or rent stalls.Unless boarding/renting contracts suggest the abil-ity of farm management to initiate and enforce in-fection control protocols, there is often nothingstopping people from removing horses in the midstof an outbreak. This can pose a risk of dissemina-tion of the disease agent(s), and the main approachto preventing this from happening is education andcommunication. When it is clear that keepinghorses on the farm is the most ethical response andwhere people are considering taking their horsesaway, some key talking points would include thefollowing: If your horse has already been exposed, they might infect the new farm. That could lead toa new outbreak, affecting other horses andpeople, and potentially creating liability con-cerns for you (because you knowingly took ahigher-risk horse to a new facility). If your horse has already been exposed, it is possible that the stress of moving could in-crease the risk of it getting sick. It may bebetter off here where there will be closemonitoring. If your horse has not been exposed, here is what we are going to do to make sure it staysunexposed. Emphasizing risks posed by movement (to the horse owner and others) as well as demonstrating that aplan is in place to effectively control the currentoutbreak can help convince people to comply withinfection control recommendations. 9. Communication Communication is often overlooked and is some-thing that can lead to mistrust, confusion, anderrors in response. Common communications prob-lems include the following: Failure to communicate with all relevant personnel Failure to provide prompt information Failure to provide complete information 324 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTFailure to adequately explain why things are being performed Communication at an inappropriate level (depth of content, language) Failure to be consistent in decision making (e.g., designation of horse's status or recom-mendation for management) Failure to provide frequent updates on the sta- tus of the situation and updates on the plan fordealing with the evolving situation Good communication can help ensure recommendedpractices are followed, facilitate good informationgathering, develop trust, or allay fears. Poor com-munication can result in mistrust, fear, inadequatecompliance, and an ineffective response. A few ba-sic tenets of communication are below: 1. Never announce a problem without providing your proposed plan for dealing with the prob-lem now and as it evolves. 2. An information void does not remain for long. If people do not get the information from agood source, they will nd other informationsomewhere. 3. The truth/factual information is rarely worse than the rumor mill. Providing clear infor-mation prevents people from relying on inac-curate information. 4. Credibility is hard to regain. If incomplete or misinformation is provided, credibility can belost quickly. 5. Ensure everyone who needs to know nds out directly from the best source. If people orgroups are left out, mistrust or anger candevelop. 6. Update regularly. Even if there is no change, say something. People would rather hearthat things are unchanged (or even if they aredeteriorating) than nothing. 7. Be consistent. If a story changes, explain why. Ideally, have the same person (or peo-ple) directing communications and dependingon the scope of the incident. It would be op-timal for this person to have media training. 8. Be honest. Do not be afraid to say \"we do not know.\" However, follow any statement likethat with an explanation of what is being per-formed to nd out. (e.g., We do not knowwhat the cause is yet. However, we are test-ing to determine the cause, and while knowingthe specic cause would be nice, it will notchange what we're doing to start). 9. Explain why. If people do not understand why something is being performed, they maybe less motivated to comply. 10. Outbreak Review The natural tendency after an outbreak is over is totry to move on quickly and try to forget about it.However, in many ways, that is the opposite of whatshould be done. Outbreaks can provide important insight into future risks (GI disease or otherwise),the ability to respond, and strengths or weaknessesthat were exposed in the outbreak response. After an outbreak is over, a review of the entire event should be performed. This is ideally per-formed soon enough after the outbreak that memo-ries are strong but after a long enough time forstressed, tired, or overburdened individuals to re-turn to a more normal schedule and workload.The review should evaluate why the problem hap-pened, all levels of the response, and the state of thefarm at the completion of the outbreak. This can beused to identify measures that are needed to preventfurther outbreaks and identify gaps or weaknessesin the response that can be strengthened should asimilar problem ever occur. Typically, variousmeasures can be undertaken to improve routinepractices and improve outbreak response. The af-termath of an outbreak is a very teachable moment. Related to this is a creation of a nal report to relevant stakeholders (e.g., facility owner/manage-ment, people who have horses on the farm, veteri-narians who were involved, farm personnel). Thiscan provide a summary of the problem and the re-sponse, along with any measures that are beingtaken to improve routine practices. Communicat-ing any changes is important to facilitate compli-ance, and compliance is often better when changesare initiated shortly after an outbreak given thatmemory of the effect of the outbreak providesmotivation. 11. Conclusions Outbreaks of infectious diseases are an ever-presentrisk with horses. Measures can and should betaken to reduce the risk of pathogen entry andspread, but many practices inherent in the equineindustry mean that some residual risk will remain.Although all infections are not avoidable, the 'pre-ventable fraction' may be substantial. A proactiveinfection control program can limit the introductionof pathogens, reduce the risk of sporadic disease,and reduce the risk of outbreaks that develop inresponse to pathogen entry. Basic approaches topreventive infection control and outbreak responseare not overly cumbersome but are often inade-quately used, increasing the assumed risk. Veter-inarians are in a position to assist with promptrecognition of problems and implementation of anaggressive and logical but still practical outbreakresponse.

Introduction The suspicion of a respiratory disease outbreak sit-uation poses many questions to the attending veter-inarian. First, what is the cause of the apparentdisease? What will be the time course of the infec-tious and clinically apparent phases of the disease?What will be the duration of disease spread through-out the potentially exposed horses? How long afterclinical resolution will recovered individuals be in-fectious to na\u00efve contacts? Is there any potentialfor environmental persistence of the infectiousagent, and will a reservoir be generated within therecovered population? With respect to the facility,how long must control measures, if any, remain inforce? How long before transport of recovered indi-viduals is possible without risking dissemination ofdisease? Of economic importance, how long shouldsale, showing, and breeding of recovered individualsbe postponed? Regrettably, there is no one all-embracing answer to any of these questions individ- ually or collectively. The attending veterinarian isforced to balance clinical and business continuityaims to the satisfaction of all affected parties, while holding welfare of the affected horse paramount.In some situations this can be a thankless task. 2. Epidemiological Considerations in a Potential Respiratory Disease Outbreak Efcacy of Preclinical Infectivity and Its Effects on Control Measures Control of contagious disease outbreaks is achieved largely by two means: the isolation of affected in-dividuals, and both identication and segregation ofall animals in contact with symptomatic cases.However, success of such control measures is largelydetermined by the proportion of disease transmis-sion that occurred prior to the onset of clinical signsor asymptomatic infection, as well as the inherenttransmission potential of the infectious agent itself,which is directly dependent on its reproductive ca-pacity. The proportion of transmission prior toonset of clinical signs in infected individuals deter-mines whether control measures based upon clinicalsigns will be effective in reducing new cases. It is AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 327IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT NOTESassumed, prior to the appearance of clinical diseasein infected individuals, movement within the popu-lation allows all susceptible individuals an equalchance to become infected. For an outbreak to ex-pand in the initial stages, multiple secondary casesmust be induced by contact with the primary cases.The speed at which the outbreak occurs dependsupon the interval between contact with the rstclinical case and signs of disease in the subsequentcontacts. Date of Onset Although the rst horse displaying clinical signspresented for examination may be considered therst case by the farm personnel, close questioningmay reveal that the index case was earlier. In thissituation, the outbreak is already established andongoing. This provides information regarding pos-sible means of introduction to the herd and helpsweigh the likelihood of various differential diagno-ses and likelihood of various control strategies. Attack Rate This is dened as the number of new cases duringthe period of interest as a percentage of the entirepopulation at risk at the beginning of that period.Attack rate varies depending on the etiologicalagent, with variations in rate of transmission, de-gree of infectivity, population susceptibility, andlength of the pre-clinical phase of infection deter-mining the rapidity at which the population seemsto be affected. This can provide clues as to diagno-sis in light of knowledge of the biology of candidateinfectious agents. Methods of Disease Transmission Each infectious agent has a characteristic way bywhich it is most readily transmitted; however, thismeans of spread is not exclusive of other methods.Understanding of agent transference is crucial tothe implementation of appropriate infection controlmeasures. Transference can be divided into threebroad categories: aerosol, direct, and indirectcontact. Aerosol spread is via droplets shed from the respi- ratory tract remaining in the air a sufcient timeand in sufcient quantities to establish infection inanother host. Infection may be established in anew host via exposure through the ocular or respi-ratory membranes. Direct contact requires close physical contact be- tween infected and susceptible horses allowingphysical transfer of infectious organisms in bodysecretions, particularly respiratory. Horses kepttogether in close connement are susceptible totransference by this route. Indirect contact involves deposition of bodily se- cretions of sufcient infectivity to establish diseasein a new host on surfaces common to infected andas-yet uninfected horses such as through sharedtrailers, shared water sources, or shared tack orwipe rags. Fomite transmission via contaminated handlers and their equipment is also part of thiscategory. Care should be taken not to submergethe hose end or handle in individual water buckets ifa common water source is used. 3. Examination of the Affected Horse(s) History Taking of the Affected Horses In addition to signalment recent medical history, interaction with other horses, transportation (ifany), and vaccination status are important to deter-mine. With respect to the clinical presentation ofthe affected horse(s), the onset, duration, and natureof the presenting signs should be accurately deter-mined. Where the facility has a rapid turnover ofresident horses, viral respiratory disease outbreaklikelihood is increased. Where solitary horses, or asmall herd kept in a closed environment, are af-fected with upper respiratory tract disease it is lesslikely that viral respiratory pathogens are responsi-ble, although reactivation of latent carriers andshedding of virus is possible. Before contact with a potentially infected and likely contagious horse, the veterinarian shoulddetermine whether personal protective clothing(gowns, gloves, boots, head coverings) should beused. Physical Examination Following observation at a distance of general de-meanor, the pattern and effort involved in thethoracic respiratory excursion should be noted,this giving clues as to the extent of respiratorytract involvement. As part of an examination di-rected toward infection of the upper respiratorytract, mucous membrane color, moisture, and relltime should be assessed. Facial symmetry andthe presence of any swellings should be deter-mined. The nature, color, and odor of any ocularor nasal discharges should be noted, and whetherthey are present unilaterally or bilaterally (whichsuggests involvement of the paranasal sinuses).The pharyngeal area should be palpated: the any distensionof the pouches, and retropharyngealmasses (likely abscessed lymph nodes) can beassessed. Differential Diagnosis of Pyrexia Fever is likely to be one of the primary reasons thatveterinary evaluation of the affected horse or horsesis sought. There are numerous infectious agentsthat can be associated with high fever in the indi-vidual horse, rarely in outbreaks, but not contagiousupper respiratory tract infection: Respiratory system /H18546Bacterial pneumonia, tract strenuous exercise, transport stress, anhidrosis,hypertrichosis Candidate Diagnoses for Respiratory Disease Outbreaks (N.B state reporting requirements differ) Equine HerpesvirusInfection with equine herpesvirus (EHV)-1 andEHV-4 is widespread and predominantly subclini-cal, with latent infection commonplace. Transmis-sion is usually dependent upon direct contact;however, mechanical spread via fomites and inocu-lation by aerosol is likely, particularly in those sit-uations in which horses are housed closely together.Abortion, respiratory, and neurological disease hasbeen associated with infection, with resulting dis-ease severity dependent on viral subtype, strain,and host response to infection. Rate and degree ofspread throughout a group of horses is variable,with sometimes only a small number of cases dis-playing overt disease. In situations in which respi-ratory disease becomes clinically apparent, infectionresults in moderate-to-high fever ( /H11350102.5\u00b0F), an oc- casional shallow and acute onset of aserous to mucopurulent nasal discharge. Latentinfection is clinically silent. Following experimental infection, viral shedding persisted for up to 14 days; however, viremia hasbeen demonstrated in some cases for many weekspost inoculation. 1Due to widespread latency, all horses on the premises can be considered potentialcarriers. Recrudescence of latent infection follow-ing stress (transport, social) leads to nasal sheddingof virus and may or may not show signs of disease,this being dependent to some degree on the generalhealth of the host.Equine Influenza VirusEquine influenza virus (EIV) is highly contagiousand spread readily by the aerosol airborne route.Dissemination through a small number of denselyhoused horses may be rapid. Unvaccinated horsesexperience a rapid onset of high fever (to 104\u00b0F),profound depression, high volume serous progress-ing to mucopurulent nasal discharge, and a harshdry cough. Where vaccination has been efca-ciously applied, manifestation of disease is consider-ably attenuated, with fever likely absent and onlynasal discharge and an exercise-induced coughnoted. If herd immunity is high, the number of subclinically infected individuals will be high.Equine influenza has been shown to be unpredict-able in its ability to cause outbreaks within vacci-nated populations, due to antigenic drift inherentin this virus family. 2Shedding of EIV post infection from na\u00efve horses can be expected for up to 10 days, with vaccinatesshedding for a signicantly shorter period. Giventhat infection generates considerable immunity, thelong-term carrier state is not produced. Equine Arteritis Virus Infection with equine arteritis virus (EAV) causes a nonspecic syndrome. Fever and depression aretypically present; however, any of the following mayappear singly or in concert with other signs: edemaof in allbodily secretions: ocular, nasal, urine, feces, and inthe case of sexually intact mature male, semen.Transmission of EAV occurs by both the respiratoryand venereal routes. Respiratory transmission re-quires some degree of direct contact; airbornetransmission has not demonstrated, and reports ofprolonged minimal separation and a shared airspacenot facilitating infection of an entire herd exist. 3 Spread of disease via the respiratory route is there-fore comparatively slow. With respect to venereal transmission, infected mature intact males will all shed virus in their se-men in the immediate period post infection. 4Per- sistence of the carrier state is variable in durationand dependent upon the presence of T, with virusshed from the accessory sex glands. Streptococcus equi Subspecies equi (Strangles) Infection with Streptococcus equi subspecies equi is characterized by varying degrees of fever, depres-sion, purulent nasal discharge, and pharyngeallymphadenopathy depending on age and immunestatus of the affected individual. Infection may beasymptomatic, mild, or occasionally disseminatedthroughout the lymphatic system in younger horses.Rarely, widespread vasculitis occurs hem-orrhagica), which can result in signicant cutaneouslesions and laminitis. Transmission requires closecontact between the infected horse and susceptibleindividuals; however, fomite spread is well docu-mented. Point sources (e.g., water troughs, hoses,feed bins, cleaning equipment and locations wherehorses congregate such as stalls and pens) are com-monly associated with spread throughout a herdgiven that these are favorable environments for de-position and persistence of infected secretions.Depending on trafc at a water source, outbreaks ofclinical disease can therefore seem rapid and wide-spread due to the compressed timeframe over whichsuccessful inoculation can occur. The majority of infected horses eliminate the bac- teria rapidly; however, not all individuals achievebacteriological clearance. 5Generation of the car - rier state is important in persistence of the infectionon a property, disease induction in new arrivals, andreoccurrence of disease within an apparently closed AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 329IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTherd. The organism may be shed for at least 1month post resolution of clinical signs, with pro-longed periods (years) also reported. 5Infection is resident most frequently within the guttural pouches with rare cases found to have persistentinfection in the paranasal sinuses. Detection ofthese reservoir horses is difcult, they maintainclinical silence and the results of a single negativediagnostic test is insufcient to declare a horse freeof infection and thus free of posing a risk to suscep-tible individuals. 6 Other Viruses Associated With Upper Respiratory Tract Infections Regardless of the causative agent, clinical signs aresimilar: fever, mucopurulent nasal discharge, andsome degree of cough. Diagnostic efforts skewedtoward the above-mentioned agents will fail toachieve an etiological diagnosis in large percentageof clinical cases. 7,8In others, infections with mul - tiple agents can occur.7-9EHV-2 and EHV-5 are found as co-infecting viruses, and it is thought thatthey may predispose horses to infection with morecommon agents. 10,11Equine adenovirus and equine rhinitis virus A and B are also found in cases of clinical upper respiratory disease; how-ever, consistent pathogenicity is debated as theycan, like EHV-1, be recovered from unaffectedhorses as well. 8,12,13 Making the Decision to Institute Barrier Precautions, Containment Procedures, and Quarantine Protocols Clinical impression leading to a presumptive diag-nosis will be, in the early stages of a potential out-break, the determining factor in the extent of theinstitution of biosecurity measures. Effectivenessof isolation protocols is dependent upon a low rate ofdisease transmission prior to the onset of overt clin-ical signs in the rst recognized case(s). Whereconsiderable transmission has occurred before theonset of clinical signs, isolation protocols for rstcases and identied in-contact horses are unlikely toblunt the onset of an outbreak; however, spread toother locations may be curtailed by institution ofappropriate measures in a timely fashion on theaffected property. In real-life clinical situations, there will be de- lays between the recognition of disease and theinstitution of barrier precautions and isolationprotocols. The timeliness of segregation of af-fected horses is in large part dependent on thenature of the clinical signs, severity of the ensuingillness, the time course of these events, and howprepared the facility is to implement a responseplan for containment of a contagious disease inci-dent. Delays will therefore, in some cases, havethe potential to signicantly reduce the effective-ness of these control measures.4. Diagnostic Testing Importance of an Etiological Diagnosis Where achievable, identication of the infectious agent greatly aids in the design and implementationof effective control measures. For agents with apropensity for rapid aerosol spread over consider-able distances, for example EIV, rigorous controlmeasures including strict barrier precautions andavoidance of common air spaces are necessary.This is in contrast with agents such as EHV, EAV,and Strangles, which require closer contact betweenhorses for droplet transmission to occur, where pro-tective clothing, gloves, and the avoidance of sharedequipment may sufce. Collection of Samples Diagnostic sampling of the equine respiratory tracthas been well reviewed. 14The upper airway can be sampled by swabs or lavages. Swabs are primarily for the detection of viral pathogens (culture, molec-ular, immunoassay) although without the aid of endoscopy and nasopharyngealflushes provide samples suitable for culture and mo-lecular diagnosis. Culture Bacterial culture of swabs is complicated by the numerous nonpathogenic organisms present; how-ever, Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (culture, polymerase reaction [PCR]) can be identiedby this method. When PCR and ELISA Respiratory secretions or whole blood can be col-lected for the assessment of the presence of RNA orDNA of specic infectious agents by the PCR. Bothviable pathogens and nonviable genetic materialwill be detected, which may lead to a false assump-tion of infectivity in some cases. Antigenic proteinscharacteristic of a particular infectious agent may berevealed by ELISA testing. Molecular methods en-able pathogen detection more rapidly than virusisolation or adenovirus, equine rhinitisvirus A or B) are readily detected with high sensi-tivity by these means. Comprehensive multi-agent respiratory pathogen panels are available and cost effective. Turn-around time varies from 1 to 4 working days. Dur-ing this period, given that more clinical cases maybecome apparent, it is essential that ongoing effortsto diagnose and contain spread of infection continue. 330 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTSerology To retrospectively diagnose viral respiratory dis-eases, paired serum samples can be assessed: anacute sample collected during the febrile phase, fol-lowed by convalescent sample 14-21 days later.A 4-fold increase in titer is considered a positive testresult and evidence of recent exposure to the partic-ular agent. However, a positive test result sug-gests exposure not always active infection, and anegative test result does not absolutely rule outdisease. Sample Handling and Transport Microbiological swabs and lavages for bacterial cul-ture should be handled with aseptic technique toavoid contamination and kept refrigerated untilplating of samples is possible. Given that the PCRtest is extremely sensitive, care must be taken toavoid contamination of the sample at all stages ofsample collection and subsequent handling. Wholeblood should be not be exposed to heat sources, andclotting of the sample must be avoided, necessitatingthorough mixing of the anticoagulant at the time ofsample collection. Samples for serology should beallowed to clot at room temperature, then if a delayin assay is expected, serum can be drawn off the clotfor separate storage (freezing is possible). In allcases, sample collection, handling and storage re-quirements of the particular diagnostic laboratoryselected for assay of samples should be known inadvance and strictly adhered to. 5. The Facility as Your Patient Distribution and Mixing of Horses on the Property Many disease models simplistically assume that thehorse population is homogenous and each individualhas an equal chance of interacting with and there-fore being infected by any diseased individual.In reality, a number of factors affect the spread of aninfectious agent through a resident population ofhorses. The age distribution of the population affects the rapidity and degree of disease spread. With in-creasing average age of the population, disease in-cidence is potentially reduced due to the likelihoodof pre-existing immunity within mature individualsresulting from previous exposure regardless of theindividual variation in susceptibility of younger po-tentially na\u00efve horses present. Interplaying with demographics is population density. Where crowding is present, immunity ofmature individuals has a more pronounced effect inreducing spread among young na\u00efve horses. Thiseffect is less important where stocking density islower. Also, clustering of horses occurs due toownership and management factors creating sub-populations, providing uneven chances for contactwith infectious individuals present in othersubpopulations.These factors should be considered when investi- gating an outbreak where horses in one part of thefacility or belonging to one particular owner aredifferentially infected compared with the overallpopulace. This provides clues as to where the rstrecognized clinical case may have arisen, the mostsusceptible members of the population, and also theexpected time course of the outbreak. Population Structure and Movement of Resident Horses and New Introductions Generally a predominantly young, more densely stocked facility is more at risk from a rapidly spread-ing disease agent. Consequently, with consider-ation of the agents involved, addition of new horseson to the property while infectious disease may bepresent (diagnosed or as yet clinically silent) is morelikely to result in infection of the new arrival. Sim-ilarly, introduction without adequate isolation pro-cedures of a new horse on to a property denselystocked with a younger demographic is more likelyto result in the introduction of an infectious agentwith the ability to spread throughout the residentpopulation. A high proportion of pregnant horsesmay lower herd immunity due to the inherent im-mune suppression of pregnancy. In the rst instance, movement of horses around the facility and mixing of individuals from differentage groups should be discontinued until a diagnosisis obtained and control of new infections achieved. Biosecurity Implications and Actions for Various Infectious Agents Ease of transmission and persistence of the infec- tious agent within the individual, population andfacility has profound implications for biosecurity ac-tivities to attempt control of disease going forward. At minimum, disposable gloves should be used when handling all horses resident on the property.Disposable gowns or coveralls should be used wherethere is a risk of contamination to operators (cough-ing, production of contaminated aerosols or secre-tions), these being changed between barns orindividual horses depending on the ability of thefacility to allow sufcient segregation of horses.Hand washing or the use of sanitizing gels should beinstituted between horses and barns. Feeding andcleaning utensils should be disinfected and nottransferred. If the operation is of sufcient sizeand there are sufcient staff available, nominationof specic personnel to dened areas of the facilitywill reduce the potential for fomite spread to otherbarns on the property as yet unaffected. Infection with respiratory forms of EHV may take several weeks to spread throughout a herd situation,making recognition of an outbreak sometimes dif-cult. The slow rate of spread makes isolation ofaffected and in-contact individuals an effectivemeans of controlling spread during outbreaks onceidentied. Where clinical disease is mild, isolationof clinical cases and twice-daily monitoring for AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 331IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTfever of contacts practiced. Where sufcient segre-gation of these groups is possible, and rigorous bar-rier precautions put in place, normal operations ofthe farm are possible to continue. In situations inwhich abortigenic or neurological cases are present,strict isolation of the facility, movement control ofthe resident horses, notication of state authorities(if required by law), and suspension of operations ismandatory. In the case of EIV, a highly contagious nature and high rate of subclinical transmission necessitatesclosure of affected facilities and cessation of intro-duction of horses on to the property. In situationswhere regular contact between all potentially af-fected individuals occurs (e.g., large numbers turnedout together regularly), segregation of horses willnot prevent spread of infection, and vaccination ofthe herd in the face of an outbreak is unlikely to beof benet as considerable spread will have occurredprior to recognition of the initial clinical cases.Where limited or episodic contact occurs betweenresident horses, prompt boosting of immunity byvaccination (e.g., intranasal route) may be of benetto rapidly generate local immunity and curtailspread throughout the herd. Where infection with EAV is suspected, outbreak control is accomplished by cessation of all breeding-related activities and movement control, isolation ofaffected horses, and segregation of all (infected anduninfected) resident horses. Notwithstanding therequirement for close contact to enable respiratoryspread, potential for environmental contaminationand fomite spread due to virus shedding by multipleroutes, and the signicant consequences of thespread of infection (chiefly reproductive), necessitatestrict control measures to be instituted. Transmission of Streptococcus equi subspecies equi infection can be effectively curtailed by theearly detection of infected and shedding individualsby serial nasopharyngeal sampling. Three groupsof horses will be identied: known infected or thosewith compatible clinical signs (fever, nasal dis-charge, lymphadenopathy); suspect cases beingthose horses deemed to have had sufcient contactwith known infected horses and those displayingpremonitory signs of infection (fever); and a cleangroup of those believed to have not had contact withinfected horses or their secretions. Strict barrierprecautions should be instituted between all horseson the property, with horses identied in the rsttwo groups listed previously being placed in theappropriate group under strict isolation conditions.Should disease progression be noted in any horse inthe suspect or clean groups, that horse is escalatedto the group comprising horses in the next level ofdisease category. Horses do not leave their groupuntil the outbreak is declared over and pre-ordainedcriteria for freedom of disease have been met by allindividuals in their group of which they will havehad close contact during segregation. Further-more, unless strict isolation can be assured for newarrivals, no horses should enter the property until the outbreak is demonstrated to be over. The attending veterinarian has a central role in the practical application of control measures.When a disease outbreak is rst recognized, theveterinarian should personally examine the facilityand use their expertise to design control measurescompatible with the facility and personnel available.Periodically, reassessment of the efcacy of controlmeasures should be conducted, and is best achievedby direct inspection of the property. Decontamination and Disinfection Where Required Persistence of infectious respiratory disease-causingagents varies, and is summarized in the followingAmerican Association of Equine Practitioners(AAEP) infectious disease guidelines resource:http://www.aaep.org/-i-151.html. The majority ofinfectious respiratory disease causing agents do notpersist outside the body for prolonged periods.Viral causes require cell association, moisture, orrapid transference to avoid inactivation; however,the period is variable between agents (e.g. EHVseveral weeks, EIV /H113493 days). Streptococcus equi subspecies equi has been demonstrated experimen-tally to persist up to 63 days in favorable environ-ments free of competition from environmental flora,although this should be interpreted with cautiondue to the articial conditions inherent in thisstudy. 6A period of 30 days is stated in the AAEP guidelines. Where gross contamination with respiratory se- cretions has occurred, and can be localized to man-ageable common horse areas, decontamination ofthe infected environment involves removal of or-ganic matter, physical cleaning and disinfection torender infectious agents inert. The veterinarian isrequired to assess the nature and extent of the sur-faces where decontamination is to be attempted, toadvise upon the practicality of attempting this pro-cedure, and to offer a reasoned opinion as to theutility of the nancial and labor expendituresinvolved. Removal of bedding, fecal material, and contami- nated feed is the rst step to decontamination of theenvironment. During this phase it is important notto spread infected material; therefore, care shouldbe taken by handling it separately and with appro-priate barrier precautions. Cleaning begins afterorganic matter has been removed, and includesscrubbing of the walls and floors with a detergentsolution and then rinsing with water. Avoid dis-semination of infectious agents by droplets. Oncethe area has dried, disinfection can be performed. There are various categories of disinfectants: peroxygen products, phenolics, chlorine, iodophors,and quaternary ammonium compounds. 15Peroxy - gen products have a broad antimicrobial spectrum,with activity in the presence of organic matter.Phenolic disinfectants are effective in the presenceof organic debris and will kill bacteria and viruses. 332 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK are inactivated byorganic material necessitating a thorough cleaningprior to usage are corrosive and will cause discolor-ation of contact surfaces. Iodophors are also corro-sive and rendered inactive by organic material.Quaternary ammonium compounds are also inac-tivated by organic material, are incompatible withsoaps and detergents, and may be less effectiveagainst some infectious agents than othercompounds. Reinstitution of Normal Operations EHVIsolation for up to 28 ( /H1135021) days following the last clinical case may be required. Discontinuing of iso-lation protocols is dependent upon all exposed orinfected horses being tested by nasal swab and dis-playing a negative result by PCR. EIV Isolation procedures can be removed 21 days after resolution of the nal clinical case. Environmentalpersistence is short (/H11349 3 days). EAV Once virus isolation of nasal or pharyngeal swabs and blood is negative, horses can be released fromcontrol measures if there has been resolution of clin-ical signs and freedom from new cases for 3-4weeks. Streptococcus equi subspecies equi For apparently recovered horses, it is recommended that three consecutive weekly PCR and culture sam-ples are obtained by nasopharyngeal washing.All must be negative to categorize the horse as ofminimal risk to in-contact horses. Should a posi-tive result be obtained on any sample, further diag-nostic investigation is indicated to nd the focus ofinfection. Thereafter, treatment followed by com-prehensive retesting is indicated. For those horseswithout known exposure or fever for a period of 21days, testing is not indicated. More detailed information can be found at http:// www.equinediseasecc.org/diseases.aspx and by ac-cessing the AAEP infectious disease guidelines athttp://www.aaep.org/-i-151.html. Following the outbreak, containment, and even- tual elimination of any contagious disease, an isola-tion and monitoring policy for all new arrivalscomplete with diagnostic testing appropriate for thelevel of disease risk should be designed and insti-tuted forthwith. 6. Communication With/Between Interested Parties Control of disease outbreaks depends upon isolationof affected individuals and determination of theircontacts, as previously stated. Essential to this ap-proach is rapid dissemination of information perti-nent to accurate diagnosis of infected horses, this inno small part dependent upon concise case deni- tion. Close liaison between the veterinarian, re-sponsible party for the facility (if multiple horses arepresent), and nonresident horse owners is essential. Ethical Responsibilities Client condentiality must be maintained but thiscan never be at the expense of timely and appropri-ate veterinary intervention during a respiratorydisease event. Documentation of clinical cases, ob-taining of appropriate diagnostic samples, appropri-ate handling and submission of biological samples ina timely fashion to maximize the opportunity tomake an accurate diagnosis, and a coherent diseasecontrol plan that can reasonably be expected to cur-tail the spread of the disease agent within andexternally to the affected property are the responsi-bilities of the attending veterinarian. Economicconcerns are often present, being not limited to costsof diagnosis and treatment; immediate foregoing ofboarding, show and breeding income, and reputa-tional damage to the affected property affectingfuture income potential. These cannot trump expe-ditious management of the outbreak. Legal Responsibilities Requirements for notication of state veterinary reg-ulatory authorities and legality of sharing informationwith lay parties regarding diagnosis of particular in-fectious respiratory disease agents varies dependingon the jurisdiction. The veterinarian is legally boundto follow the applicable regulations with respect to theidentity of the organism present. Requirements forstate veterinary regulatory notication of infectiousdiseases vary between states. Contact informationfor state veterinary ofcials, and succinct informationpertinent to equine diseases can be accessed as follows:http://www.equinediseasecc.org/diseases.aspx. 7. Challenges of the Veterinary Role in Infectious Disease Outbreaks Coherent Communication It is only natural that emotional responses and mis- information will abound where multiple ownerswith varying levels of understanding and risk aver-sion are involved. Integrity of the veterinarians'message will be protected by coherent written doc-umentation of clinical case denition, recording of clinical ndings and results of laboratory testing,recommendations regarding barrier precautions andisolation protocols and observation of what was in-stituted, and direct communication with affectedparties where required. Denition of what criteriawill be used to consider the outbreak resolved andmechanisms by which normal functioning of theproperty can be restarted, should be documented,and communicated close to the time of onset of theoutbreak to avoid the appearance of an open-endedproblem devoid of potential resolution. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 333IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTClient Condentiality The veterinarian and their support staff should ensurethat no information is shared or implied during inter-actions with peripheral parties. The economic conse-quences to owners and managers affected by thedisease outbreak can be signicant, and the opportu-nity for aggrieved individuals to seek redress throughthe veterinarian's statements and actions must beavoided. Social media has the potential to seriouslycompromise veterinary efforts to maintain client con-dentiality. In these situations, counseling of all in-terested parties (veterinary, facility management,horse owner) on the inability to retract statements andimages disseminated is prudent. Comprehensiveness of Approach Reputation of the veterinarian will be enhanced by arapid assessment of the disease outbreak situation,implementation of timely and accurate diagnosticprocedures, promotion of the welfare of the affectedhorses through comprehensive treatment, transferof important diagnostic information to appropriateparties, and impartial but compassionate applica-tion of control measures for all affected and in-con-tact horses present on the property. 8. Take-Home Message There is a tendency to 'shoot the messenger' when asignicant respiratory pathogen is diagnosed lead-ing to the necessity for restriction of horse move-ment and curtailing of facility operation while stepsare undertaken to control the disease. A proactiveveterinary response is needed: depending on theagent involved, considerable spread of infection mayhave occurred before the rst case is recognized, orthe inherent virulence of the organism may allowtransmission at a sufcient rate to render isolationprotocols ineffective to contain further infections.

SAHOs rely on the expertise and assistance of equine practitioners inassisting them in protecting the national equine population from diseases of regulatory impor-tance. Diseases of regulatory importance may vary from state to state; therefore, the practitionermust be aware of the equine diseases that they need to report to the SAHO and potential responsesby the SAHO. Ultimately, collaboration and communication between equine private practitionersand the regulatory ofcials across the United States is essential for protecting and promoting thehealth of the U.S. equine population. Author's address: Equine Staff Veterinarian with the Cali-fornia Department of Food and Agriculture, Animal Health Branch, Equine Programs, Sacramento,CA 95833; e-mail: katherine.flynn@cdfa.ca.gov. health ofcials (SAHOs), under thedirection of the state veterinarian, protect animalagriculture in their respective states through dis-ease surveillance and implementation of move-ment regulations and control activities forregulated diseases. The SAHOs in each state arethe experts in livestock health regulations and areresponsible for development and enforcement ofstate animal health laws. State animal healthlaws are typically based on federal regulationsoutlining federal disease control programs; how-ever, state laws may also include state-speciclaws that go beyond those included in federal dis-ease control programs to address industry desig-nated livestock disease risks of concern within astate.Historically, SAHOs primarily focus on protecting the health of food-producing animals such as cattle,sheep, swine, goats and poultry to ensure a whole-some, healthy, food supply for the U.S. consumers.The available funding and workforce efforts are fo-cused on diseases or situations that pose publichealth or catastrophic animal health risks. Due tothis prioritization of funding and personnel, limitedresources and expertise may be available to addressequine health issues in a state. In addition, duringthe past ten years, reduction in state and federalbudgets and personnel have signicantly affectedthe availability of resources in many states. At a minimum, SAHOs monitor equine diseases and equine movement in states to mitigate threatsand to effectively respond to disease incursions.Equine regulatory disease responses include identi- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 335IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT NOTESfying diseased equids, those with positive test re-sults for diseases regulated in the state, conductingepidemiologic investigations, tracing and potentiallytesting exposed animals, assessing and determiningquarantine implementation and release parameters,implementing appropriate disease control methodol-ogies, issuing movement restrictions when appropri-ate, and reporting disease investigation ndings.Implementation of science-based biosecurity mea-sures is critical to protecting the health of the na-tional equine population from diseases of regulatoryconcern. 1 2. State Reportable Disease Lists\u2014Equine Equine diseases of regulatory concern are those thathave potential state, national, or global signicance.For example, an incursion of a foreign animal dis-ease, such as African horse sickness in the UnitedStates would have signicant national and globalimpact given that the U.S. equine population is na-\u00efve to this disease and could result in high mortalityand immediate trade implications including likelymovement restrictions on export of equids from theU.S. In contrast, an introduction of Streptococcus equi subspecies equi into a group of horses on a U.S. farm would result in limited fatalities in the affectedhorses and minimal, if any, restrictions on trade.Both diseases are of concern to the U.S. equine in-dustry; all states require reporting of African horsesickness if it were to occur in the U.S. but only a fewstates require reporting of strangles cases. The World Organization for Animal Health (Ofce of Epizootics International [OIE]) member countriesmust report the occurrence of any disease deemed byOIE as of international signicance. The list ofinternational reportable diseases can be found athttp://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-wo rld/oie- listed-diseases-2016/. The diseases ofequids are included on Reportable DiseaseList: African equine encephalitis. Detection of a for-eign animal disease, one not known to exist in theU.S., would have major economic and trade effectsand require immediate state/federal notication andprompt implementation of control measures to pro-tect the U.S. equine population. In the U.S., the National Animal Health Report- ing System (NAHRS) is the U.S. reporting systemfor the OIE-reportable diseases. SAHOs submitmonthly reports of the occurrence of conrmed OIE-reportable diseases in livestock in their states toU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) viaNAHRS. The reporting is as a yes or no for occur-rence of the listed disease in the state. TheNAHRS Reportable Diseases list is available at:https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/monitoring-and-surveillance/sa_disease_ reporting/ct_disease_list. It is important to note that SAHOs are responsible for monitoring equine disease trends in their statesto assess risks and to determine triggers for en-hanced disease control measures in the state. Eachstate develops and maintains a state reportable-disease list, which might include endemic equinediseases of concern to the state's equine industry, inaddition to and USDA-reportable determine which often in consultation withindustry. Industry-driven reportable diseases mayinclude diseases such as strangles or pigeon fever.The state veterinarian determines who is responsi-ble for reporting the disease or condition (i.e., diag-nostic laboratory, veterinarians, owners, etc.), towhom to make the report (state/federal ofcial),when it should be reported (i.e., immediately [within24 h] or within 2 days or within 30 days), and whatshould be reported (suspicious signs or conditions,laboratory-conrmed case, conrmed disease agentdetection). For example, equine herpesvirus my-eloencephalopathy (EHM) was added to the Califor-nia Reportable Animal Disease List in January2011. Before 2011, California SAHOs had beenmonitoring the situation and noted an increase inconrmed neurologic cases of EHV-1. Nationally,the increase in the number of EHM outbreaks war-ranted further industry research and discussions todetermine appropriate actions that should occurwhen this disease is in California. The CaliforniaDepartment of Food and Agriculture Equine Advi-sory Committee agreed that the risk of EHM neces-sitated regulatory actions to protect the health of theCalifornia equine industry and a decision was madeto add EHM to the California Reportable DiseaseList. Inconsistencies in state reportable animal disease lists are a recognized challenge to those in theequine industry and the lists represent a variationin equine disease risk and control issues across theUnited States. Private practitioners are encour-aged to familiarize themselves with the reportabledisease list in their state and to communicate di-rectly any concerns regarding the state reportabledisease list to SAHOs. 3. Detection of Reportable Disease The private practitioner is essential in protectingthe health of the equine industry given that theyare the rst line of defense and response to a regu-latory reportable disease situation. If a reportabledisease is suspected, the private practitioner isurged to promptly contact the local state or federalanimal health ofcial to discuss the situation. Thestate regulatory ofcial can provide immediate guid-ance on management of a suspect case specicallyrelated to sample collection, specimen handling, ap-propriate diagnostic tests to request, and implemen-tation of biosecurity measures. In addition, the 336 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTSAHO may be aware of other similar incidents andthus potential exposure risks may be identiedthrough this initial discussion between the equinepractitioner and the SAHO. A list of contact infor-mation for the State Veterinarian is available at http://www.usaha.org/Portals/6/StateAnimalHealthOfcials.pdf or at http://equinediseasecc.org/veterinarians.aspx. Detection of a regulated reportable equine disease results in the SAHO assessment of disease risks anddetermination of appropriate disease control mea-sures to implement, such as quarantine, movementcontrols, and biosecurity measures. The regulatoryresponse depends upon the disease agent detectedand the epidemiologic investigation ndings. De-pending on the disease, a regulatory action, such asquarantine, may be instituted for a suspect case, butoftentimes regulatory action is not taken until aconrmatory diagnosis is made. However, it is im-portant to note that reporting of a disease situationdoes not necessarily dictate a regulatory response,given that the SAHO investigation of the situationmay deem control measures unnecessary and thusthe report of a monitored condition or disease mayrequire no SAHO action. For highly infectious andhighly contagious diseases, expansive quarantinesand movement restrictions may be essential toquickly and effectively control disease. Humaneeuthanasia may be the only option for protecting theequine population if and when a disease cannot becontrolled. For the more common equine regula-tory diseases, such as EIA, EP, equine viral arteri-tis, and CEM, there are federal guidance documentsor recommendations for handling suspect and posi-tive cases. Unfortunately, there are no federalequine domestic control program regulations andvery limited federal disease control standards,which can lead to inconsistent handling of equineregulated diseases across the United States. 4. Examples of Responses to Reportable Disease Incidents in California EHM In February 2012, there were two2conrmed EHM incidents in California. One incident involved a 350-horse boarding facility and one incident in-volved a 500/H11001 horse polo facility. Upon notica- tion, the SAHO visited each site and in consultationwith the private practitioner performed a risk as-sessment to determine appropriate quarantine pa-rameters and biosecurity measures. Biosecurity risks identied by the SAHO at the boarding facility included lack of isolation facilities,numerous daily visitors (14 trainers, eight onsitefarriers, an onsite veterinary practice, and an onsitetraining facility), sharing of equipment, communalwater and carrot bins, frequent commingling ofhorses, lack of horse inventory monitoring (i.e., norecords of horse movements), frequent movement ofhorses on and off the premises, and nonexistentbiosecurity measures. Based on the numerous movements at the facility and the commingling ofhorses, the entire premises was quarantined andrecommended biosecurity measures were imple-mented. Due to slow implementation of biosecurityand failure to immediately implement adequate iso-lation, febrile EHV-1 cases and horses with nasaldischarge cases continued to be diagnosed and thequarantine was prolonged to 34 days at this facility. At the polo facility, the private practitioner was presented with a horse displaying acute onset ofneurologic signs, specically severe hind limbataxia, urinary bladder atony and eventual recum-bency with inability to rise. The neurologic horsewas immediately removed from the population andisolated and subsequently euthanized. Upon labo-ratory conrmation of EHM, risks identied at the polofacility included riders' sharing of horses and shar-ing of equipment between horses. Minimal butsome biosecurity measures were in place on the pologrounds. Based on the extensive commingling ofhorses and sharing of equipment between horses,the entire premises was quarantined and a re-stricted training and exercise plan was implementedto eliminate commingling of horses on the operation.The polo facility was very prompt in isolating andremoving the sick horse within 12 hours of initialdetection of disease as well as implementing neces-sary enhanced biosecurity measures. They werealso prompt in the cleaning and disinfecting of theindex horse's stall area. No additional cases weredetected on the premises and quarantine was effec-tively released in 21 days from the time it was ini-tiated. Subsequently, the facility implemented anEHV-1 control plan. This same facility experiencedan EHM case in 2016; the EHM case was euthanizedwithin 3 hours of clinical onset of neurological signs.Based on lessons learned from the 2012 incident, theoperation had implemented routine biosecurity anddisease control measures to minimize disease riskon the premises. The 2016 risk assessment dem-onstrated a marked reduction in risk of potentialdisease spread, thus the resulting quarantine wasrestricted to one stabling area containing 70 exposedhorses allowing for business continuity on the otherparts of the premises. The prompt detection andthe routine implementation of biosecurity enabledthe facility to quickly eliminate the source of infec-tion and prevent disease spread. The quarantinewas released 14 days after the removal of the clinicalcase given that no additional clinical cases weredetected and the likelihood of exposure of horses onthe operation to EHV-1 based on routine biosecuritythat was in place was minimal. In general, SAHOs take action to prevent spread of EHV-1 off of the affected operation but SAHOsmay have a limited role in assisting the operation inreducing spread of the virus at the premises level.Thus, the private practitioner's role would be toassist their client with implementation of appropri- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 337IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTate on-farm disease control measures. In stateswhere the EHM is not reportable, the SAHO doesnot have any role in disease control, thus all controlefforts are the sole responsibility of the privatepractitioner. During the last 5 years, regulatory ofcials across the U.S. have investigated numerous EHM casesand continue to learn how to most effectively assessrisk and manage these incidents while making sci-ence-based decisions. In 2014, the United StatesAnimals Health Association (USAHA) hosted ameeting to discuss the changes in EHM and science-based response options for state animal health of-cials. 2Subsequently, great efforts have been made to have regulatory responses be science based. However, there are still variations among the regu-latory responses by SAHOs. Ultimately, the pri-vate practitioner invariably plays a critical role inonsite regulatory disease control. In summary, theCalifornia EHM regulatory management experiencedemonstrates that prompt isolation of EHM casesand implementation of baseline premises-level bios-ecurity practices, which are then enhanced upondisease detection, can ensure business continuityand shorter quarantine periods. Contagious Equine Metritis In January 2013, a private practitioner evaluating a17-year-old Lusitano mare with a history of infertil-ity submitted reproductive-tract samples to the Cal-ifornia Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratoryfor bacterial culture. The culture results conrmedpresence of Taylorella equigenitalis, the organism responsible for the foreign animal disease, CEM.During the 2012 breeding season, the index marewas bred by live cover and articial insemination toa 20-year-old stallionconrmed infection with T. equigenitalis . The epidemiologic investigation required tracing of any mares or stallions potentially exposed to theinfected stallion. An exposed stallion is dened asany stallion collected at the stallion station duringthe 7 days before the infected stallion and the 7 daysafter the infected stallion. During the 2012 breed-ing season, the infected Lusitano stallion was col-lected at a California stallion station. An exposedmare is dened as any mare bred by live cover orarticial insemination to the infected stallion. Theinitial epidemiologic investigation identied 11 ex-posed stallions and one exposed mare. The burden-some testing protocols, at the owner's expense, included collection intervals of three sets of culturesfrom exposed mares and stallions and live cover ofexposed stallions to two certied CEM-negative testmares. During the testing protocols, the exposedhorses were under quarantine and unable to be usedfor breeding. The stallion station that involved thisincident had six exposed stallions onsite; accordingto the stallion station owner, the estimated loss inrevenue during the CEM investigation and quaran- tine period was $75,000. One exposed stallion and one exposed mare were subsequently conrmed to be infected with T. equi- genitalis and underwent required treatment and ad- ditional testing protocols. The second infectedstallion was a domestic 25-year-old Lipizzaner stal-lion that had semen collected in 2012 at the samefacility as the initially identied infected Lusitanostallion. The second infected mare was a domestic,13-year-old, Andalusian-cross breed that had beenarticially inseminated with semen from the in-fected Lusitano stallion in 2012. This mare wasfound to be pregnant. All test positive animals un-derwent the required additional treatment and test-ing protocols. The National Veterinary ServicesLaboratory determined that the strain of the T. equi- genitalis from all four infected horses were identical but failed to match to any previously identiedstrains of T. equigenitalis from the U.S., indicating these cases were not related to any previous U.S.T. equigenitalis cases. Frozen semen collected in 2009 from the index Lusitano stallion was also conrmed to containT. equigenitalis . The epidemiologic investigation could not determine the time of exposure or source ofthe infection of this index stallion, given that theprivate practitioner, who managed the pre-2009breeding of this stallion in the U.S., had retired andburned his medical records. Fortunately, this inci-dent had limited scope compared with the large mul-tistate outbreak of contagious equine metritis in2008-2010, which resulted in the detection of 22 T. equigenitalis -infected stallions and ve T. equigeni- talis-infected mares at a cost to the industry of $11-16 million. 3,4 In summary, an astute private practitioner and laboratory diagnostician detected a foreign animaldisease agent and eliminated a potential diseaserisk to the equine industry. Unfortunately in thisincident, the source of infection could not be deter-mined, so continued vigilance is necessary to detectany potentially unidentied carrier animals. Dual Infection of Racing Quarter Horses With Equine Infectious Anemia and Equine Piroplasmosis Agent In 2012, the Animal Health Branch of the California Department of Food and Agriculture began investi-gating infections of EIA and EP in the Californiaracing Quarter Horse population. Since 2012, 39racing Quarter Horses have been conrmed positivefor EIA and 21 racing Quarter Horses have beenconrmed to Theileria equi , the causative agent of Ten of the positive horses had dualEIA and EP infections. One of the dual-infectedhorses was examined by a private practitioner whohad worked with state animal health ofcials ontreating a previously identied T. equi infected horse. The private practitioner contacted theSAHO to report that she had examined a racingQuarter Horse that had severe anemia. The 338 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENThorse's condition continued to deteriorate and it waseuthanized. At time of necropsy, the horse wasconrmed to be infected with both EIA and T. equi . Testing of horses from the premises of origin for thishorse resulted in subsequent detection of additionalEIA and T. equi-infected horses. The management options for an EIA infected horse are humane euthanasia or restrictive lifetimequarantine of the individual horse at least 200 yardsfrom other horses. All of the EIA-infected horsesdetected during the 2012 investigation were eutha-nized. The management options for T. equi-in- fected horses are humane euthanasia, lifetimequarantine of the individual horse in a tick-freeenvironment, or enrollment in an approved EPtreatment program and release if determined tohave cleared the organism. Two of the conrmedT. equi -infected horses successfully completed treat- ment and were released from quarantine. One EP-positive stallion was unsuccessful in clearance of theorganism with two rounds of imidocarb treatmentand was subsequently euthanized. Currently, oneof the T. equi -infected horses remains under quar- antine following two unsuccessful rounds of imido-carb treatment. 5All other T. equi-infected horses detected during this investigation were euthanized. The epidemiologic investigation into this incident and previous U.S. incidents involving racing Quar-ter Horses provides useful information for targetingcontrol and outreach efforts to minimize the risk ofdisease transmission. 6The age range for the Cali - fornia EIA-infected horses was 3-8 years of agewith an average age of 4.6 years. The epidemio-logic investigation suggests that the majority of theinfected horses participated in both sanctioned andunsanctioned Quarter Horses racing in the U.S.Additional aspects of the investigation suggestedthat cultural practices led to the potential exposureof the affected horses to high-risk practice, such assharing of needles and other medical equipment orthe use of contaminated blood products. Althoughdifcult to verify, information obtained during theinvestigation suggested potential illegal importationof blood products from Mexico and the illegal move-ment of racing Quarter Horses across the Mexicanborder for participation in unsanctioned racing.During the investigation, the Animal Health Branchof the California Department of Food and Agricul-ture worked closely with California Horse RacingBoard (CHRB) resulting in CHRB implementationof EIA testing requirements for all horses entering aCHRB enclosure including those originating fromfacilities within the borders of California. Al-though there were fewer cases of EIA in racingQuarter Horses detected in California in 2015, thedisease is likely to continue to appear if there arecontinued high-risk practices occurring among thissegment of the industry. Private-practitioner as-sistance in targeted outreach and education on risksposed by unhygienic practices among the racingQuarter Horse industry population can potentiallyassist in decreasing exposure of racing Quarter Horses to EIA and other blood-borne infectiousagents. It is also important that retired racingQuarter Horses with the potential for exposure toEIA or T. equi be tested and determined to be test negative before moving into their second careers,such as roping, barrel racing, trail, or show uses. 5. Local Role of Private Practitioner on Regulatory Issues Regulatory ofcials need private practitioner as- sistance in addressing equine regulatory issues.The mission is the same for all parties: to protectthe health and well-being of the horse. The privatepractitioners are the eyes and ears in the equinedisease world, given that they monitor domestic dis-eases and likely would be the rst to detect potentialemergence of foreign animal diseases. Regulatoryofcials rely on the private practitioner to knowwhat is actually happening disease-wise on horsefarms. Practitioners are encouraged to communi-cate their observations or concerns with regulatoryofcials. The SAHOs want to know what practitio-ners are seeing, not just the regulated diseases, butalso other health or welfare issues affecting theequine industry. Informed SAHOs can ensure ap-propriate, feasible, science-based measures can beapplied to the situation. SAHOs can be a resourceto practitioners to assist with coordinating diagnos-tic testing, which in some cases may be performedfree of charge to the horse owner. For regulatorydiseases, the SAHO may have access to researchstudies related to treatments that may benet thehorse. In addition, the regulatory ofcial may haveaccess to the latest scientic research on new diag-nostics or disease control methodologies, which mayassist the client in addressing their horse's disease. Disease agents are ever changing and veterinari- ans in the eld are trying to keep pace. On thenational and international equine disease front, reg-ulatory ofcials continue to monitor diseases of reg-ulatory importance. SAHO may be aware of adisease investigation in the early stages in anotherstate and this information may be benecial to aveterinarian investigating a similar disease in theirpractice. However, due to the limited funding andpersonnel resources, information gathered on dis-eases of regulatory importance may not be ade-quately disseminated to the horse industry. Theprivate practitioner can assist by communicatingwith regulatory ofcials and sharing the informa-tion with their clients. A partnership with two-waydialogue between the regulatory ofcials and privatepractitioners ensures that the health and welfare ofthe horse comes rst. 6. Opportunities for Private Practitioner Involvement in Regulatory Issues Contrary to common belief, decisions regarding equine regulatory issues are not made in a vacuumby regulators sitting in dark rooms. Decisions at AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 339IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTthe state and national level are made in consulta-tions with industry stakeholders. Regulators wel-come and seek input from private practitioners toensure regulations and measures appropriately ad-dress equine health issues. At the state level, all SAHOs are interested in hearing from the industry stakeholders. Practitio-ners are encouraged to contact their SAHO to deter-mine how feedback on equine health issues can beprovided in that state. Some states have equineadvisory committees that may include private prac-titioners, whereas other states have industry stake-holder open forums to solicit feedback. Some statesmay have an e-mail distribution list for notifyingpractitioners of equine regulatory and any other dis-ease issues, whereas other states with limited re-sources may rely on private practitioners or stateindustry representatives to get the regulatory mes-sage out to the industry in their state. Makingcontact with the regulatory ofcial in the state willenable you to become part of the team protecting thehealth of the horse. At the national level, several organizations work on equine regulatory issues, such as the USAHA,the National Institute of Animal Agriculture(NIAA), and the American Horse Council (AHC).In addition, national breed or discipline organiza-tions also play a role in protecting equine health byaddressing regulatory issues. Private practitionersare encouraged to communicate concerns to thesegroups. The USAHA mission is implemented through de- liberations of its' 32 science-based committees andthe adoption of resolutions and recommendationsaimed at solving animal health problems. The pur-pose of the USAHA Committee on Infectious Dis-eases of Horses (IDOHC) is to address and seeksolutions to infectious disease issues that can com-promise the health of the nation's equine population.As part of its purpose, the Committee resolves tokeep USAHA members, USDA, the equine industry,and other stakeholders informed of disease prob-lems confronting the industry. The committee alsoserves as a sounding board for discussion on equinehealth-related issues and for the development ofstrategies/solutions to resolve such problems. TheIDOHC has four disease subcommittees that in-clude a subcommittee on EIA, EP, EHV-1, andCEM. Subcommittee work focuses on using sci-entic and diagnostic advances to implement newpolicies and procedures for regulatory disease con-trol. Participation in IDOHC and subcommitteeactivity is restricted to members of USAHA. Toview proceedings of previous IDOHC meetingsand accomplishments of the USAHA visit http://www.usaha.org/Committees/InfectiousDiseasesOfHorses.aspx. One of the major accomplishments of the EHV-1 Subcommittee is the development of the2015 Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy Inci- dent Guidance Document for State Animal HealthOfcials . The intent of the guidance document is toprovide SAHOs with the science-based control op- tions to consider during an EHM incident. TheEHV-1 Subcommittee used latest eld experienceand scientic data to develop the most appropriateguidance on how to reduce disease-agent spreadwhile optimizing business continuity. The guid-ance document can be found at http://www.usaha-.org/Portals/6/Committees/horses/IDOHC%20EHM%20Guidance%20Document%20Sept%202015%20Edited%20FINAL.pdf. Those interested in direct-ing regulatory change for equine diseases are en-couraged to become a member of USAHA and theIDOHC. The mission of NIAA is to provide a resource for individuals and organizations to obtain information,education, and solutions for challenges facing theanimal agriculture industry. NIAA is dedicated toprograms that promote best practices in the man-agement of animal health and wellbeing. The mis-sion of the Equine Committee is to address keyequine health issues relevant to the economic well-being of the U.S. equine industry. To view proceed-ings of previous NIAA Equine Committee meetingsand accomplishments see http://www.animalagriculture.org. Those interested in discussingequine issues are encouraged to become a member ofNIAA Equine Committee. The USAHA and NIAA co-hosted The ease Forum on January 19-21, 2016 in Denver,Colorado. The objective of this unique forum wasto provide the latest updates on disease threats toequine health, to identify potential solutions foraddressing current risks to equine health, and toenhance equine industry collaboration and com-munications. Those attending the forum in-cluded SAHOs, United State Department ofAgriculture-Animal and Plant Health InspectionService-Veterinary Service (USDA-APHIS-VS)veterinarians, and equine industry representatives.The current challenges identied during the forumincluded limited regulatory funding and personnel,limited federal authority for equine disease control,lack of consistency between states related to diseasecontrol and movement regulations, lack of metrics todetermine the effect of an equine disease, lack of acentralized equine disease database, limited eld-level disease outbreak research, limited traceabilityof equines, limited implementation of biosecurity,the need for advancing equine practitioner involve-ment, the potential for stakeholder engagement indisease prevention and control, and the challengesof communication within the equine indus-try. Next-step discussions focused on four maintopic areas: 1) enhancing communications, 2) mov-ing toward consistency in state regulations, 3) im-plementing an individual equine identicationprogram, and 4) promoting biosecurity. The ForumPlanning Committee will review the Forum Evalu-ation Survey data and feedback to develop a plan foradvancing equine health. In addition, a white pa- 340 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTper is being prepared for dissemination to stake-holders. For more information about the Forum,including viewing of the presentations, visit www.animalagriculture.org/equineforum. The AHC was organized in 1969 to represent the horse industry before Congress and the federal regu-latory agencies. AHC is a nonprot corporation thatrepresents all segments of the equine industry. TheAHC mission is to promote and protect the equineindustry by representing its' interests in Congress andin federal regulatory agencies on national issues ofimportance; to unify the equine industry by informingindustry members of regulations and pending legisla-tion, and by serving as a forum for all member orga-nizations and individuals; and to advise and informgovernment and the industry of the equine industry'simportant role in the U.S. economy. The AHC Healthand Regulatory Committee addresses equine regula-tory disease issues. For more information on theAHC membership and activities visit http://www.horsecouncil.org/. 7. Conclusion Everyone involved with the equine industry has arole in protecting the nation's equine population andaddressing equine regulatory issues. However, theprivate practitioner plays a vital role in identifyingand reporting the occurrence of regulatory diseases,which threaten the U.S. equine industry, to ensureprompt response and immediate control. Commu-nication and cooperation between the equine owningpublic, private practitioners, industry organiza-tions, and state/federal animal health ofcials are pivotal for advancing and protecting the health ofthe nation's equines.

An overview of these recent incidents ispresented along with key issues identied duringthe outbreaks and lessons learned for future plan-ning and preparedness. 2. Federal Role in Response to Equine Disease Outbreaks Regulatory diseases are those diseases that are re-portable by law to state or federal animal healthauthorities. As equine veterinarians, knowledge ofregulatory diseases and appropriate recognition andreporting of suspect cases is a key component of ourresponsibilities. These reportable diseases typi-cally include foreign animal diseases and infectiousdiseases that are internationally reportable to theWorld Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), 1but they also may include other contagious or infectiousdiseases that have an existing control or eradicationprogram, or potentially any disease that threatensthe national herd either by its clinical features or its effect on international trade. Given that there are many differences between the individual reportable diseases lists of each state,U.S. Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) recentlyproposed a National List of Reportable Animal Dis-eases, 2which, if codied, might serve to provide a more standardized list which state animal healthauthorities could reference in their own regulations.Although a specic disease appears on either a stateor federal list of reportable animal diseases, it isimportant to recognize that reportable does not nec-essarily mean actionable. Although some report-able diseases have a specied response by state orfederal animal health ofcials if the disease is con-rmed, other diseases may have been made report-able due to the need for surveillance data to becollected or reported and not necessarily becausesome sort of movement restriction or other responseaction will result if that disease is found. When a reportable disease that is actionable is identied, often state and federal animal health of-cials collaborate in their response to that particu-lar disease. Although federal animal healthauthority does provide for the issuance of a federal 342 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT NOTESquarantine, in most cases this is not necessary andwe tend to jointly respond to regulatory diseasesusing the state's quarantine authority. Some of theresources that the federal animal health authority(USDA-APHIS-Veterinary Services) brings to a re-sponse effort include eld personnel, such as veter-inary medical ofcers and animal healthtechnicians, laboratory diagnostic support throughthe National Veterinary Services Laboratories andthe National Animal Health Laboratory Network,subject matter experts and epidemiological support,and trade support and negotiation. Overall, it isthe quick identication and rapid response involvingstrong collaboration between state animal healthofcials, federal animal health ofcials, privatepractitioners, academia, laboratories, and theequine industry that results in the most successfulresponses to regulatory disease outbreaks. 3. Recent High-Impact Equine Disease Outbreaks A \"high-impact\" or \"high-consequence\" equine dis-ease is a disease that has one or more of the follow-ing characteristics: Results in high morbidity or high mortality Has the potential for human health implications Is listed as a foreign-animal disease Domestic disease with new increased/unex- pected virulence Disease with limited intervention options Disease that has severe or debilitating trade ramications Results in an outbreak that affects a large number of equids/owners/premises Any disease that elicits a palpable level of con- cern or panic in the equine industry Unfortunately, the United States has experienced anumber of equine disease outbreaks in recent yearsthat could be considered to t into this \"high-impact\"category. The following includes summary infor-mation and lessons learned on some of the mostsignicant high-impact equine disease outbreaksencountered. 4. Contagious Equine Metritis In December 2008, an active breeding stallion inKentucky was found to be culture positive for qualify for semen export. Given that CEM is aforeign-animal disease in the United States, an ex-tensive regulatory investigation ensued during thenext 2 years in which 1005 horses (278 stallions and727 mares) were determined to have been directlyexposed in 48 states. Diagnostic testing of the ex-posed horses eventually led to the nding of 22 stal-lions, one gelding, and ve mares being chroniccarriers of Taylorella equigenitalis at the time they were tested. 3It is likely that many more maresmay have actually become infected immediately af- ter their exposures to positive stallions in the out-break; however, due to the ability of many mares toclear the infection on their own with only a smallpercentage resulting in a chronic carrier state, it isunknown just how many mares were actually previ-ously infected in the incident. Epidemiologic anal-ysis suggested that all of the positive horses werelinked to a single common source, most likely a Fjordstallion imported into the United States in 2000. 3 The investigation also showed that stallion-to-stal-lion transmission occurred through contaminatedfomites at breeding facilities such as inadequatelycleaned and disinfected articial vaginas, washbuckets, breeding dummies, hands, or other sources.Transmission to mares occurred through both live-cover breeding and articial insemination evenwhen semen extenders containing seemingly appro-priate antibiotics were used. All exposed horses were quarantined and could not be used for breeding activities until completionof the regulatory testing protocol yielded all nega-tive results. This was an expensive process espe-cially for stallion owners given the ofcial protocol,based on our rigorous U.S. CEM-import protocol, required test breeding of two qualied mares and asampling period over approximately 30 days to becompleted. Although some cost sharing was pro-vided in which USDA-APHIS covered the cost of thesample shipping and diagnostic testing and stateanimal health ofcials provided personnel resourcesand oversight, the exposed horse owner had to coverthe cost of sample collection by their private practi-tioner. This burden ended up being cost prohibi-tive for some stallion owners at the time and thosestallions were forced to stay under quarantine untilthe sampling and testing could be completed. All of the infected horses were ultimately success- fully treated, conrmed as negative on retesting,and released from quarantine with the response tothe incident completed in late 2010. Although thisoutbreak was the largest CEM outbreak in U.S.history both in geographic scope and numbers ofhorses involved, other smaller outbreaks of CEMhave occurred since with most cases traced back tosome involvement with previously imported horses.This leaves concern as to how imported horses in-fected with T. equigenitalis are slipping though our import-testing protocols and whether exemptionfrom CEM testing on horses imported from certaincountries might be contributing to the problem.In addition, as was the case in the 2008-2010 out-break, most of the subsequent index-infected stal-lion cases in the United States were identied onroutine culture for qualication to export semen toanother country. The absence of adequate domes-tic surveillance for T. equigenitalis in the U.S. active breeding stallion population almost guarantees thatCEM cases will not be detected quickly and, there-fore, may eventually lead to another outbreak of size AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 343IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTand scope similar to that seen in the 2008-2010incident. Lessons learned from recent CEM outbreaks in- clude the following: Despite CEM quarantine and rigorous testing for imports, outbreaks in the United States canand do occur. Many different breeds and disciplines can be affected in CEM outbreaks (there were 12breeds of stallions found to be infected in the2008-2010 outbreak). 3 The sheer volume and frequency of equine movements leads to continued spread in theabsence of adequate biosecurity. CEM testing of /H110221000 horses in 48 states, as happened in the 2008-2010 outbreak, is chal-lenging and expensive for all involved. Even foreign-animal diseases require good do- mestic surveillance to detect. Education and outreach to the equine industry needs to be an ongoing effort, especially on thetopics of biosecurity in breeding practices andmaintaining surveillance in active breedingstallions. 5. Vesicular Stomatitis Although vesicular stomatitis (VS) is a seasonal,sporadically occurring endemic disease in the south-western United States with large-scale outbreakstypically surfacing every 8-10 years, the trade ram-ications associated with these outbreaks can becrippling to the equine industry. When outbreaksoccur, any VS-susceptible livestock, includinghorses, in an affected state are barred from move-ment to Canada until 21 days after the last quaran-tine in that affected state is released. Given thatVS outbreaks can go on from early spring throughthe fall and sometimes even into early winter, move-ment of horses from the United States to Canada oreven attempts to return Canadian horses to Canadacan be extremely challenging. In addition, manyother countries impose VS export testing require-ments on all susceptible United States livestock,which is an added cost to the export pro-cess. Horses exposed to vesicular stomatitis virus(VSV) during an outbreak year can maintain anti-body titers for many years thereafter, which mayeffectively remove their eligibility for export if acountry requires a negative VSV antibody test forimportation. Finally, more rigorous interstatemovement requirements during an outbreak or con-cern for disease exposure can cause equine eventparticipants to be unable or unwilling to attend anequine show or event in a VS-affected state, whichcan have a serious economic effect on the event, thevenue, and the state. Back-to-back VS outbreaks in 2014 and 2015 in- volving the same strain and genetic lineage of VSVresulted in all of these described economic hardshipsand challenges. The 2014 VS outbreak was thelargest in the United States since 2005, occurred from May 23, 2014 to March 13, 2015, and requireda considerable joint state and federal regulatory re-sponse to manage. Although a total of 435 VSV-positive premises (New Jersey serotype) wereconrmed in four states; Arizona (two premises inone county), Colorado (370 premises in 17 counties),Nebraska (one premises in one county), and Texas(62 premises in 13 counties), many more suspect andpresumptive-positive premises were also quaran-tined and managed during the response. Of the435 conrmed infected premises, 405 were positiveequine premises, 27 were positive bovine premises,and three premises had both cattle and horses pos-itive. 4A change to the state/federal response to VS occurred between the 2014 and 2015 outbreaks when the OIE voted to remove VS from the interna-tional list of immediately reportable diseases. In discussion between state and federal animal health ofcials on what modications to the existingresponse might be appropriate in light of OIE'sdelisting of the disease, the following key conclu-sions were reached: 1. VS-control strategy is still needed to prevent movement of infectious animals and to secureboth interstate and international trade duringan outbreak. 2. VS must remain reportable to state and fed- eral ofcials to implement this controlstrategy. 3. Although existing regulatory response proto- cols in cloven-hooved species must be main-tained to rule out other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, response to equine casescan be appropriately modied to reduce theeffect on state and federal resources. Based on these conclusions and other recommenda- tions, state and federal ofcials employed a modiedresponse in the 2015 VS outbreak. New measuresincluded a reduction in the quarantine period basedon viral shed from affected animals, activation ofVS-approved National Animal Health LaboratoryNetwork laboratories to assist in testing of affectedequine species, and flexibility to use accredited vet-erinarians for sample collection in equine speciesand management of affected equine premises. These key changes to the response were timely indeed, as the 2015 VS outbreak quickly broke allrecords and emerged as the largest VS outbreak inrecent history with a total of 823 affected premisesin eight states: Arizona (36 premises in three coun-ties), Colorado (441 premises in 36 counties),Nebraska (38 premises in 10 counties), New Mexico(52 premises in 13 counties), South Dakota (50premises in seven counties), Texas (four premises infour counties), Utah (56 premises in 8 counties), andWyoming (146 premises in 10 counties). 5With ap - proximately 90% of the 823 affected premises beingequine premises, involvement of private practitio- 344 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTners in sample collection and management of equinepremises was a critical component of the overalloutbreak response. Lessons learned from recent VS outbreaks include the following: Planning and preparedness for large-scale VSV outbreaks needs to occur at all levels fromthe individual horse owner, the practitioner,the event manager, the laboratories, extensionagents, to state and federal animal healthofcials. Education and outreach materials containing the most accurate information and updatedresponse protocols is needed for horse ownersand private practitioners. Specic planning and response protocols are needed for equine shows and events. Responsiveness to calls and timely quarantine releases are key to owner compliance with mit-igation strategies. The equine industry needs timely and regular updates on the VS outbreak situation and thecurrently affected areas to facilitate equinemovement. Interstate and international movement re- quirements during a VS outbreak are highlyvariable and can be confusing to follow. Con-tinued standardization and negotiation ofmovement requirements based on known sci-entic principles of the disease is needed. Private practitioners are our most valuable re- source in the future management of VS. 6. Equine Piroplasmosis and Equine Infectious Anemia Although the natural transmission the causativeagents of equine piroplasmosis (EP) and equine in-fectious anemia (EIA) in the United States are noteven remotely related, the ongoing problem withiatrogenic transmission of these two diseases tiesthem closely together. Before examining the ongo-ing iatrogenic transmission issue of both diseases,there was a single large-scale outbreak of EP due tonatural tick-borne transmission in the UnitedStates, which warrants discussion and eventuallyled to the ndings of the iatrogenic transmissionproblem in a specic population of horses. In October 2009, Theileria (Babesia) equi infection was conrmed in a herd of Quarter Horses that wereused as working cow horses on a large ranch insouth Texas. Of the 360 horses present on theranch at the time, 292 horses were ultimately con-rmed to be infected with T. equi on the premises. Nearly 2500 horses were tested for EP as part of thetraceback and epidemiological investigation with atotal of 413 T. equi-positive horses eventually dis- closed in direct connection with the outbreak. 6 Active natural transmission of T. equi to horses on the index ranch was conrmed to have been occur-ring with Amblyomma tied as the primary tick species involved. Epide-miological investigation and testing of the horsessold from the premises indicated that T. equi infec- tion had likely been present in horses on the ranchsince prior to 1990 and that frequent movement ofhorses in the 1980s and prior between the ranch insouth Texas and premises in South America thatwere owned by the ranch was the likely source of theoutbreak. Although traces were located and tested EP-posi- tive in 16 different United States states, there wasno tick-borne transmission of T. equi from the EP- positive traces to other horses in any location out-side of south Texas. Given that Amblyomma cajennense ticks are not known to have become es- tablished outside of south Texas and were deter-mined to be the primary vector involved on the indexranch, it seems likely that this may be the reason forthe absence of natural transmission in other loca-tions even in cases where EP-positive horses hadbeen maintained in pastures with no reported tickcontrol for up to 20 years since having left the indexranch. It was determined from this outbreak thatspecic high-risk factors were needed on a premisesfor infected horses to efciently transmit T. equi to other horses via the tick-borne route in a pasturesituation. These factors included the presence ofmultiple T. equi- infected horses, heavy infestation by competent tick species, possibly the maintenanceof competent vectors year round, and long periods oftime in these high-risk conditions. In initial response to disclosure of the T. equi- infected herd in Texas, many states implementedmovement-testing requirements for horses originat-ing in Texas. In addition, given previous isolatedndings of T. equi infection with spread by iatro- genic transmission in Quarter Horse racehorseswith ties to unsanctioned racing in Florida in 2008 7 and Missouri/Kansas in 2009,8New Mexico began requiring EP testing of Quarter Horse racehorses entering racetracks. New Mexico began nding asmall number of T. equi-infected horses in this pop- ulation right away and racetracks in other statessubsequently began requiring EP testing to entersanctioned racetracks. Since November 2009, more than 292,000 domes- tic U.S. horses have been tested for EP through thisactive surveillance and movement testing. equi-positive, 10Babesia caballi identied through this surveillance. These positive horsesare unrelated to the 2009 Texas ranch outbreak.Of the 262 positive horses identied through activesurveillance, 213 were Quarter Horse racehorses, 13were Thoroughbred racehorses, one was a QuarterHorse roping horse, three were identied during anillegal importation investigation, and 32 werehorses previously imported to the United States be-fore August 2005 under the complement xationtest. 9The epidemiology investigations conducted AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 345IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTin all of these cases have indicated no evidence oftick-borne transmission and the cases in racehorses,specically, have involved iatrogenic transmission(needle/syringe/IV equipment reuse, blood transfu-sions, contamination of multi-use drug vials, etc.) asthe method of spread. There were also epidemio-logical links to unsanctioned racing found in many ofthese cases. Although active surveillance for EP through test- ing to enter sanctioned racetracks has been highlysuccessful in identifying infected Quarter Horseracehorses, a disturbing trend has appeared as thenumber of tracks requiring testing has decreasedduring the past 6 years. There were more than75,000 horses tested annually through all activeU.S. surveillance in 2010 and 2011 and more than45,000 horses tested in 2012, but surveillance test-ing has declined over time to only 20,000 horsestested in 2015. Although there was once at least 11states that required EP testing to enter sanctionedracetracks, at the time of this writing only twostates (Texas and New Mexico) currently have astanding EP test requirement for entry to race-tracks. In addition, 14 of the 15 T. equi-positive Quarter Horse racehorses identied in 2015 hadbeen running exclusively at sanctioned tracks thathad removed their previous EP test requirementand these horses were only found positive when theindex case in each cluster was tested to enter aTexas racetrack. All EP-positive horses found in the United States are placed under State quarantine and the horseowners are offered four options for long-term man-agement under state/federal regulatory oversight:1) life-time quarantine, 2) euthanasia, 3) exportfrom the country, or 4) long-term quarantine withenrollment in the APHIS-VS and USDA-Agricul-tural Research dipropionate proto-col. 10In February 2013, APHIS-VS established a policy to release horses previously infected with T. equi that had completed the ofcial treatment pro- gram, been proven cleared of the organism by aseries of diagnostic methods over time, and were testnegative on all available diagnostics. Of the 262positive horses unrelated to the Texas ranch out-break, 162 have either died or been euthanized, 18have been exported, and 55 have been enrolled ontothe treatment research program. Twenty-six of thehorses enrolled onto the treatment program havemet all of the test-negative requirements and havebeen released from quarantine. From the Texasranch outbreak, 163 horses were enrolled onto thetreatment research program and have completedtreatment with more than 140 horses having met alltest-negative requirements and are eligible forrelease. Over the past few years, during investigation of T. equi-positive Quarter Horse racing clusters, 13 horses that were co-infected with EIA virus wereidentied in three different states. In all of thesecases, iatrogenic transmission of both T. equi and EIA virus was implicated as the cause of the dualinfections. It seems clear that the unhygienic prac-tices occurring in these high-risk groups of horseshave the propensity to spread all blood-borne patho-gens and it is as-yet unknown how widespread thesepractices might be. These recent ndings have ledto a change in regulatory follow-up testing. When-ever EP or EIA-positive Quarter Horse racehorseis identied, regulatory ofcials have instituted test-ing for the other disease as well to evaluate whetherthe horse may be co-infected with the otherpathogen. Quarter Horse racehorses have also been unex- pectedly involved in large clusters of EIA-positivecases found during the past few years. Thirty-nineEIA-positive Quarter Horse racehorses were foundin California between 2012 and 2015, and a singleepidemiologically-linked cluster of at least 15 EIA-positive Quarter Horse racehorses were found inCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington in 2015 alone.Iatrogenic transmission related to owner/trainerpractices was indicated as the most likely cause inthe majority of these cases. It seems that the his-toric absence of an EIA test requirement for \"in-state\" horses to enter racetracks in California,Oregon, and Washington may have played a role insome of these cases having gone undetected for solong. Lessons learned from these EP and EIA outbreaks described include the following: EP has been identied in three distinct popu- lations in the United States: the isolatedTexas ranch incident, which has since beenresolved; horses imported prior to 2005; andthe Quarter Horse racing industry. Natural tick-borne transmission of EP in the United States is likely to be sustained andefcient only in certain geographic areas if thedisease is allowed to exist in horses there. EP and EIA transmission via iatrogenic means is an ongoing problem in the Quarter Horseracing industry, especially in the horses, own-ers, and trainers with ties to unsanctionedracing. Surveillance testing and educational outreach in high-risk equine populations is the mosteffective way to mitigate iatrogenic spread ofthe causative agents of EP and EIA. Treatment continues to be a promising exit strategy for horses infected with the causativeagents of EP. Surveillance testing for EP in Quarter Horse racehorses has been declining in recent yearsand may not be adequate to nd positivehorses before they move to other sectors of theindustry. 346 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE largest equine herpesvirus myeloen-cephalopathy (EHM) outbreaks in North Americaoccurred in horses that had attended the NationalCutting Horse Association Western National Cham-pionship held April 29 to May 8, 2011 in Ogden,Utah. 11Although EHM is not a federally report - able disease and is only variably reportable in se-lected states, due to the multistate nature of thisoutbreak, the American Association of Equine Prac-titioners, the American Horse Council, and the Na-tional Assembly of State Animal Health Ofcialsrequested assistance from USDA-APHIS-Veteri-nary Services in coordinating and communicatingthe outbreak response. The initial EHM cases that presented subsequent to leaving the event were quickly determined diag-nostically to be infected with the neuropathogenicstrain type of EHV-1. With more than 400 horsesofcially entered in the event and an undeterminednumber of tag-along, turn-back, and noncompetinghorses in training all disbursing to 19 potential des-tination states, it was clear that the total number ofprimary exposed and secondary exposed horses wasgoing to be extensive. In fact, the total number ofhorses and premises exposed could never be deter-mined, but was conrmed to have been more than2100 horses exposed on more than 240 premises in19 states. By the end of the outbreak on June 23,2011, a total of 57 EHV-1 cases and 33 EHM caseswere conrmed on 62 premises. 12Thirteen13 horses died or were euthanized in association withthe outbreak. Although these cases represent ex-posed horses that presented with clinical signs andhad laboratory conrmation of EHV-1, there weremany more suspect cases that had no laboratoryconrmation and therefore were absent from thesenal statistics. An additional 66 horses wereEHV-1 suspect cases and 10 horses were EHM sus-pect cases with no laboratory conrmation. As state animal health ofcials scrambled to nd the exposed horses, set up either voluntary or ofcialmovement restrictions, and implement biosecurityand containment on exposed premises in the initialdays of the outbreak, the social media exploded withmisinformation and caused additional panic acrossthe equine industry. Although the misinformationwas eventually overcome through national-level sit-uation reporting on the USDA-APHIS website andclear, concise guidance by the National CuttingHorse Association and American Association ofEquine Practitioners, the outbreak had revealed theugly side of social media during a disease outbreak.This has led directly to the creation of the equinedisease communication center (EDCC), an equineindustry initiative with collaborative support fromstate and federal animal health ofcials and manyequine organizations within the industry. 13The goal of the EDCC is to ensure that conrmed equinedisease outbreak information is being quickly gath-ered and reported to the general public to avoid the spread of misinformation. It also provides one-stop-shopping for general disease information andreliable sources for guidelines on disease control andbiosecurity. The EDCC's involvement in dissemi-nation of information in more recent EHM out-breaks has seemed to greatly reduce the amount ofmisinformation being spread through social media. Lessons learned from recent large-scale outbreaks of EHM include the following: Frequent and widespread movement of horses in the United States is a continued risk factorfor signicant EHM outbreaks. Biosecurity at both the individual horse and individual premises levels is the most impor-tant method of prevention of disease spread. Widespread education and outreach within the equine industry is needed to help horse own-ers, trainers, event organizers, and equine fa-cility managers to understand and implementappropriate biosecurity to prevent spread ofEHV-1. During an EHM outbreak, there is a need for immediate transparency, notications, clearguidance, and updated public information onthe outbreak to inform decision making at alllevels. Differences between states on reporting and response measures for EHM have been a chal-lenge to adequate response and prevention ofdisease spread. Equine practitioners have the unique exper- tise and opportunity to provide consultation toequine owners and event managers on biosecu-rity protocols and infection control planning. 8. Conclusions Although the responses to outbreaks of CEM, VS,EP, EIA, and EHM have been generally successfulin recent years, there have been critical lessonslearned in each of these incidents. Some of theincidents have highlighted key weaknesses in ourability to prevent disease introduction, surveillancestrategies that need to be bolstered, or high-riskpopulations that need more targeted efforts. Thereare a number of over-arching themes that can begarnered from each of these experiences. First, thestructure of the equine industry itself can be a chal-lenge to disease control in that it is vast, highlysegmented, composed of individuals with varyinglevels of awareness and knowledge about infectiousdisease, and unmatched in the sheer volume andfrequency of horse movements. Given these char-acteristics, there is a need for educational outreachon infectious disease and biosecurity for the newestmembers of the industry up to and including themost experienced members of the equine industryand via a variety of outreach methods. There is aneed for planning and preparedness for equine dis-ease outbreaks throughout all levels of the industry, AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 347IN-DEPTH: INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK MANAGEMENTfrom the individual horse owner to the facility man-ager to the event organizers and beyond. There is aresponsibility of all involved in disease outbreaks tocommunicate and share accurate information in atimely manner. Finally, there is a clear need formore direct interaction between equine industrygroups, equine practitioners, and state/federal ani-mal health ofcials to prepare for and respond toequine disease threats in the United States.

Introduction Better diagnostic markers for feto-placental well-beingare desirable for equine pregnancy, and recent studieshave indicated that estradiol-17 /H9252, progesterone, alpha fetoprotein (AFP), and serum amyloid A (SAA) may beuseful as indicators of normal pregnancy in mares.The objectives of the current study were to examinechanges in these biomarkers in mares with normal and abnormal pregnancy outcomes. 2. Materials and Methods Mares (n /H11005700) had blood samples taken on a weekly basis beginning in December through partu-rition or abortion. Mares (n /H1100515) aborting or pre- senting placental lesions at delivery submitted for pathologic group of gestationally age-matched mares (n /H1100530) had placentas submitted and were used as controls.Estradiol-17 /H9252, progesterone, AFP, and SAA concentra- tions were determined by immunoassay in the samplepreceding abortion/parturition in case mares as wellas samples from the matched control mares. Datawere analyzed using nominal logistic regression. 3. Results and Discussion Diagnoses included umbilical cord lesions (n /H110052), equine herpesvirus 1 (n and premature placental separation (n /H11005 2). Median gestational age of case mares was 329days (range, 246-355 d). For the single serum sam-ple taken within 1 week prior to abortion or parturi-tion from case mares, AFP was positively ( P/H11021.01), negatively ( P/H11021.05), and P/H11021.1) to be positively associated with abnor- mal pregnancy outcomes.

This study sug-gests that decreases in estradiol concentrations rela-tive to control mares and elevations in AFPconcentrations, within 7 days of parturition or abor-tion, may be useful in predicting abnormal pregnancyoutcomes during late gestation based upon a singleserum sample.

Introduction Osteoarthritis of the equine cervical facets can beassociated with stiffness, a reluctance to bend orcollect, pain on palpation, and forelimb lameness. 1 In cases of forelimb lameness, the cervical regionmay become an area of suspicion as the source oflameness if the patient fails to respond to regionaland intra-articular diagnostic analgesia of the af-fected limb, and/or the patient exhibits other clinicalsigns of neck pain. At this point, the patient willoften undergo further diagnostic imaging, includingnuclear scintigraphy, cervical radiography, and cer-vical ultrasound. Even with an abnormal diagnostic imaging nd- ing in the cervical region, the clinical signicance isoften unknown, and this does not necessarily indi-cate a source of pain. Although it is commonplaceto correlate diagnostic imaging ndings in the limbwith results of regional and/or intra-articular anal- gesia to assess clinical signicance, this combinationof diagnostics is less routinely performed in the axialskeleton. In many cases, empiric treatment is usedbased on the results from imaging modalities, andresponse to treatment is used to conrm or deny thesource of pain. Although less commonly performed,ultrasound-guided intra-articular analgesia can beused to more accurately identify the source of aforelimb lameness associated with the cervicalspine. 2. Anatomy The articular facets are composed of the caudal ar-ticular process of the more cranially located cervicalvertebra and the cranial articular process of thecaudally located vertebra (Fig 1). The facets varysomewhat in size and shape, depending on anatomiclocation. The caudal articular processes of 357THERIOGENOLOGY AND LAMENESS NOTESshorter and thicker compared with the same pro-cesses on the more cranial vertebrae. The cranialarticular processes of C7 are also wider and longerthan its caudal articular processes. This givesC6-C7 a characteristic more rounded, prominentappearance than the adjacent articular facets.Ultrasonographically, C6-C7 is usually located justcranial to the slope of the shoulder. The ability tovisualize C7-T1 varies, and in horses with longer,thinner necks, it may be readily visualized; whereasin horses with shorter necks, C7-T1 may not bevisible beyond the shoulder. The ventral branches of the last three cervical nerves and the rst two thoracic nerves contributeto the brachial plexus, with the primary componentcoming from cervical nerves seven and eight andthoracic nerve one. The sixth cervical nerve exitsthe foramen at C5-C6, the seventh cervical nerve atC6-C7, and the eighth at C7-T1. 2Thus, nerve root compression would most likely contribute to fore- limb lameness from these locations. However, le-sions more cranial in the cervical spine have alsobeen associated with forelimb lameness, and siteselection need not be limited to these more caudalfacets. 1 3. Materials and Methods Step 1: Identify the Site for Diagnostic Analgesia Diagnostic imaging ndings and the clinical exami-nation should be correlated in selecting the site(s)for diagnostic analgesia. In cases that have under-gone scintigraphy, increased radiopharmaeuticaluptake of one or more cervical facets may help in siteselection. Radiographic abnormalities associated with abnormal cervical facets include osteoarthritis,enlargement and modeling, narrowing of the inter-vertebral foramina, fracture, and osteochondrosis. 3 Ultrasound evaluation of the cervical spine is alsorecommended in most cases. Ideally the ultra-sound evaluation should be performed subsequent toradiography, given that radiography can improvelesion identication on ultrasound. Many times when intra-articular medication of facet joints is used, more than one articular facet istreated. Although this may be helpful from a ther-apeutic standpoint, it limits the specic diagnosticvalue of assessing response to treatment. For thisreason, performing a single site at a time is recom-mended for diagnostic intra-articular analgesia ofthe cervical facets. If the patient does not respondto diagnostic blocking at that site, the process can berepeated at the next location of greatest suspicion.Doing a single site at a time also minimizes anypotential risk of paresis if the block affects thenerves that contribute to the brachial plexus. When the articular facet has been selected via the diagnostic imaging ndings and clinical examina-tion, it should be denitively identied via ultra-sound prior to injection. To ensure the properlocation, the scan should begin from C2, countingcaudally to locate the facet of choice. The site canthen be marked with white tape or white correctionfluid. aIf clipping is permitted, a small square can be clipped at the site of needle placement to further localize the site. Step 2: Preparation Preparation is the same as for ultrasound-guidedmedication of the cervical articular facets and hasbeen previously described in detail. 4,5If the pa - tient has a sleek haircoat, clipping is not necessary.Otherwise, a small section should be clipped for thesite of needle placement, and, if necessary for imagequality, a larger section for better contact of theultrasound probe. Because the site of needle place-ment will vary depending on the horse's head posi-tion, a generous area should be prepared withaseptic technique. Prior to aseptically preparing the area of injection, the ultrasound machine settings should be arrangedfor maximum image quality, minimizing the needfor image manipulation at the time of the injection.We prefer to use a linear probe to maximize imageresolution, but a micro or macro convex probe can beused, if necessary (Fig 2). The depth should be setso that the facet is centered in the image, and thegain and frequency should be at a level that maxi-mizes image quality. After the machine is set, theskin can be prepared routinely for injection. Theultrasound probe should be covered with a sterileglove or sterile probe cover with gel placed inside. For intra-articular analgesia of the cervical facets, we limit the volume of mepivicaine to 2-3 mL.Although the cervical facet joints can reportedly Fig. 1. Transverse gross section of the articular facet of C4-C5. The of C5 located the ultrasound beam. 358 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY AND LAMENESSbe distended with up to 20 mL of fluid,6there is increased risk of extravasation with increasing volume. In an unpublished cadaver study of ultra-sound-guided intra-articular contrast evaluatedwith computed tomography, we increased riskof extravasation of volumes greater than 6 mL.However, it should be acknowledged that volume of2-3 mL is an empirically selected dose and has notdirectly been compared with other amounts. Alarger volume of 8-10 mL has also been used byanother experienced clinician with no reportedcomplications. b Because the lameness examination will continue after analgesia, no sedation is used. A nose twitchis applied for restraint. Often, horses will raisetheir heads with the application of the twitch. It isimportant to keep in mind that this change in headheight will alter the position of the cervical facetsand injection site, further emphasizing the impor-tance of a large prep area for injection. We do notroutinely use local anesthetic of the skin prior toinjection because the location for needle placementcan change depending on head position and alsobecause most horses do not signicantly object to needle placement. Step 3: Injection Although both longitudinal7and transverse4,8ap- proaches to cervical facet injections have been de-scribed, we prefer the transverse approach. Theinjection technique is the same as intra-articularmedication of the cervical facets. The transducer isplaced in a transverse plane to the long axis of thecervical facet, with the probe marker oriented atapproximately 11 o'clock. The handle of the trans-ducer can be kept in a neutral position or loweredslightly ventrally, which helps align the joint space and the trajectory of the needle (Fig 3). An 18-g or20-g, 3.5-inch spinal needle is used for the injection.The needle is placed at the dorsal aspect of the probeand should be angled toward the joint space, whichis centered in the image. The exact angle will varydepending on how the facet is positioned in theimage but typically ranges from 30 to 45 degreesfrom the horizontal plane. A common error is to Fig. 2. Transverse ultrasound images of a cervical articular facet. Dorsal is to the left. The image resolution is superior using thelinear ultrasound probe (A) when compared with the macroconvex ultrasound probe (B) at the same depth. The joint space is denotedby the arrows. Fig. 3.

Once the needle is placed at the margin of the joint space, the stylet is removed and the syringeapplied. It is important that the ultrasound probebe kept in place during the entire process toensure that the needle placement is not altered.The needle should not move deep to the peri-articu-lar margin. Ideally, a second person will attach thesyringe while the other person holds the needle andultrasound probe in place; although, if necessary, asingle operator can perform the entire procedure.We do not routinely aspirate joint fluid; to conrmneedle placement, a small test injection should beperformed and observed on the ultrasound screen toensure that the fluid is entering the joint and thatthere is no evidence of peri-articular injection orextravasation. When needle placement is con-rmed, the remainder of the mepivicaine can beinjected, with the entire process being evaluated onthe ultrasound image to ensure that the fluid iswithin the joint recess. As the fluid enters thejoint, the joint capsule should be seen expandingaway from the bone margins. Step 4: Evaluation After the injection, we prefer that the horse bewalked to a well-bedded or padded stall. Althoughwe consider the risk of paresis to be quite low if onlyone facet is blocked at a time, we operate with anabundance of caution. After 10 minutes, the horse is usually evaluated at a walk and a trot. A repeatevaluation can be performed at 20 minutes. If thelameness is not alleviated or resolved with the intra-articular analgesia, the process can be repeated ifthere is another site of clinical suspicion. 4. Results Since we began performing this procedure in 2013,we have used this technique in six horses. Allhorses were Warmblood breeds and ages rangedfrom 5 to 17 years of age. We have experienced nosignicant complications, including no evidence ofweakness or paresis. Four of the horses exhibitedunilateral forelimb lameness, one had a history ofstumbling and falling under saddle, and the sixthhorse exhibited a stiff neck and decreased perfor-mance prior to the procedure. The four horses withforelimb lameness underwent extensive diagnosticblocking of the affected forelimb prior to electing to perform intra-articular analgesia of the cervical fac-ets. All horses had some degree of modeling orosteoarthritic changes of at least one articular faceton diagnostic imaging evaluation, although, in nocases were the changes found to be severe. Twohorses had only one location blocked, two horses hadtwo locations blocked at two different time points,and one horse (history of stumbling) had four loca-tions blocked at different time points.

Horse 2 improved 60% after therst block. Horse 3 improved 40% with further im-provement to 80% of the lameness with an abaxialnerve block (although previously the horse had notimproved with an abaxial block prior to the cervicalfacet block). Horse 4 had an unusual stride char-acteristic that improved after diagnostic analgesiaof the cervical facet, but the lameness persisted.The horse with a history of neck stiffness and poorperformance had improved movement after diagnos-tic analgesia. No improvement was noted in thehorse with a history of stumbling. 5. Discussion Diagnostic analgesia of the cervical facets should beconsidered in cases of forelimb lameness that cannotbe attributed to other locations in the limb. In ad-dition, it can be used in cases of neck stiffness orpoor performance, although change may be moredifcult to assess in horses with subtle clinical signs.Although medical therapy can be used as both adiagnostic and therapeutic procedure, diagnosticblocking may identify a more specic source of thelameness and may also eliminate unnecessary treat-ment in horses that are unresponsive to diagnosticblocking. Although it is possible for a horse to havepain originating from locations in the neck, such asfrom the vertebral body, that would not likely re-spond to analgesia of the articular facet, the screen-ing performed by the diagnostic imaging can helptarget which horses have pathologic changes associ-ated with the articular facet rather than elsewherein the cervical region. The injection technique is quite similar to intra- articular medication of the cervical facets, with theprimary complicating factor that the patient is notsedated. Watching the injections in real time onthe ultrasound screen minimizes the risk of im-proper needle placement and the low volume of fluidleads to a low risk of extravasation. Performed inthis manner, we believe this of similar safety asintra-articular diagnostic analgesia of other joints.In summary, we have had successful outcomes using ultrasound guided intra-articular diagnosticanalgesia of the cervical articular facets for identi-fying the source of forelimb lameness. This tech-nique is an additional tool that can be used in theworkup of forelimb lameness or other abnormalitiesassociated with neck pain. For practitioners al-ready experienced in performing therapeutic ultra-sound guided intra-articular injections of thecervical articular facets, the technique is easily ap-plied and can be performed safely.

Newmarket, /H114082016 Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO80523 (Frisbie); Equine Sports Medicine, LLC and La Mesa Equine pain is a common cause of lameness inthe horse. Diagnosis and treatment commonly in-volves diagnostic analgesia (blocking) and therapeu-tic injection within the tarsometatarsal (TMT) anddistal intertarsal (DIT) joints. 1Historically, some controversy exists between clinicians on whetherthe TMT and DIT joints should be treated as twoseparate joints or as joints that communi-cate. Communication between the TMT and DITjoints has been shown to occur naturally in 8-35% ofhorses. 2-6Even though there have been reports of medication reaching therapeutic levels within theDIT joint following a single injection into the TMTjoint, the authors' extensive clinical experience man-dates the TMT and DIT joints should be treated asseparate joints. 7-9 In the authors' opinion, it is not uncommon for practitioners to only treat the TMT joint based onfamiliarity and ease of performing an arthrocentesisof the TMT joint coupled with the lack of familiarityand ease of arthrocentesis of the DIT joint. Thisstatement is further supported by a recent report reporting the accuracy of blinded injection of con-trast medium into the TMT and DIT joints to be 96and 42%, respectively. 5This is likely in part due to landmarks of the DIT joint being less-well denedcompared with the TMT joint. In a literaturesearch of \"equine distal intertarsal arthrocentesis\"on January 16, 2016, using PubMed and Googlescholar, the authors were able to dene a singleapproach (plantar lateral) to the TMT joint and twodifferent approaches (medial and dorsolateral) eachhaving multiple descriptions and landmarks dened for DIT arthrocentesis. 1,10-12 The medial approach to the DIT relies on ill- dened landmarks (i.e., gap between the talus andcentral tarsal bone), which can be difcult to palpate,in the authors' experience, compared with landmarks(distal aspect of the lateral trochlear ridge and lateraldigital extensor tendon) using the dorsolateral ap-proach. A safe position for the clinician during theprocedure is another advantage of using a dorsolateralapproach over the medial approach. Accuracy, de- 362 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY AND LAMENESS NOTESned by the deposition of therapeutic or anestheticproduct into the DIT joint compartment on the rstattempt, has been shown to be 42% using the medialapproach. 5Reports also suggest other structures (i.e., proximal intertarsal joint, tarsocrural joint, TMT joint, and cunean bursa) can be inadvertently accessedduring DIT joint injections using the medial ap-proach. 1,10,12Accuracy using the dorsolateral ap - proach has been shown to be 70%.11The authors prefer the dorsolateral technique based on reportedaccuracy, the easily palpable landmarks and the po-tentially safer position for the clinician. Although the reported accuracy is 70% using the dorsolateral approach to the DIT joint, in the au-thors' practice 30% is an unacceptable failure rate.For these reasons the authors always use radio-graph guidance and a dorsolateral approach to theDIT joint. This \"how-to\" paper describes thetechnique. 2. Materials and Methods To test the accuracy of the technique described bythe authors, the following study was undertaken ina prospective manner. Using a sterile eld createdby the paper wrapper of a set of sterile gloves, theauthors use a 20-gauge 1.5-in. needle when perform-ing both intra-articular blocking and therapeutictreatment (Fig. 1). Blocking is routinely performedwith 2-4 mL mepivacaine (20 mg/mL) in a 6-or12-mL syringe. Therapeutic treatment is typically22 mg (2 mL) of a high-molecular-weight sodiumhyaluronate (HA) and 2-4 mg (0.2-0.4 mL) of tri-amcinolone acetonide (TA) mixed in the same glasssyringe. The arthrocentesis is performed afteraseptically preparing the dorsolateral aspect of thehock alternating betadine and alcohol for a 5-minuteperiod. In the authors' practice it is rare to sedatethe horse during the procedure. Horses are re-strained with the use of a nose twitch and occasion-ally a technician holding up the ipsilateral forelimb. The needle is placed perpendicular to the skin, plantar medial, 1 cm distal to the distal lateral trochlear ridge the talus, whichis easily identied using digital palpation. Theneedle is advanced until bone is contacted (Fig. 2).If the dorsal pedal vein or tarsal artery is puncturedthe needle is advanced or redirected slightly proxi-mally until bleeding stops. A plantar lateral-dorsomedial oblique radiograph is taken to conrmneedle position relative to the DIT joint space (i.e.,distal aspect of the central tarsal bone and proximalaspect of the third tarsal bone) (Fig. 3). If the nee-dle is at the level of the DIT joint space, medicationis administered, if not, the needle is redirected in theappropriate direction and the radiograph repeated(Figs. 4, 5, and 6). Correct needle placement at thelevel of the DIT joint space, and the number of timesredirection of the needle was required (postradio-graphic imaging) was recorded over a 2-day periodin all DIT arthrocentesis attempts. 3. Results Arthrocentesis of the DIT joint was performed 32times. Radiographs conrmed the needle was cor-rectly placed on the rst attempt 24 times (75%).The needle was repositioned to the correct locationwith one attempt in the remaining eight cases(25%). Within the last 7.5 years, in the authors'practice, arthrocentesis of the DIT has been per-formed greater than 5000 times using the describedtechnique. To date, none of the authors have beenkicked or injured while performing this technique.In one instance, the digital radiograph plate wasdamaged from a kick. The dorsal pedal vein or Fig. 1.

Discussion In the authors' opinion the described technique pro-vides better accuracy, easier palpable landmarks,ability to use clinician-preferred needle, a higher- quality standard of care, and safer approach to per-forming arthrocentesis of the DIT joint comparedwith the blinded or radiograph-guided medial ap-proach. Although accuracy, as previously dened,has not been reported here, needle placement with-out radiograph guidance perpendicular to the DITjoint space (75%) was to reported accuracy(70%). 11When using radiographs to provide guid - ance for needle placement, the needle was at thelevel of the DIT joint 100% of the time in this report;with the use of two conrmation radiographs. In the described dorsolateral technique, a site 1 cm distal to the distal aspect of the lateral trochlear Fig. 3.

The needle is at the level of the DIT. Jointand mediation was injected. Fig. 5. Plantar lateral-dorsal medial radiograph after needleplacement. The needle is halfway between the DIT and TMTjoint spaces. In this case the needle was redirected proximallyapproximately 5 mm and the radiograph Plantar lateral-dorsal medial oblique radiograph afterneedle placement. The needle is between the level of the prox-imal and distal intertarsal spaces. In this case the needle wasredirected distally approximately 5 mm and the 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY AND the talus, which is easily palpable for clini-cians of any experience level, was described as theinjection site for DIT arthrocentesis. This differsslightly from a previous report, which is most likelydue to the horse population being different betweenreports. 11The authors' practice is almost exclu - sively a Quarter Horse and Arabian Western Perfor-mance horse practice. The size, conformation, andposition of the hindlimb (flexion or extension) cancause the needle to be placed in a different positionrelative to the DIT joint space when the describedtechnique is used. In the authors' experience, amore distal injection site approximately 1.5 cm tothe lateral trochlear ridge is used when injectinglarger horses (i.e., Warmblood breeds). Further-more, it is important to note the position of the limband always place the needle perpendicular to theskin and identify needle placement with aradiograph. Radiographic guidance can be performed using any approach during arthrocentesis. When com-paring the medial and dorsolateral approaches a22-gauge 1-in. needle is most common for the medialapproach. 10,12As described, the author routinely uses a 20-gauge needle to perform arthrocentesis of the DIT joint. In the authors' opinion a 20-gaugeneedle facilitates the injection of the high-molecular- weight HA, which is routinely used when therapeu-tically treating the DIT joint. It is not withoutquestion that a 20-gauge needle could be used toadminister medication into the DIT via the medialapproach, but in the authors' experience, thereseems to be a very small space on the medial aspectof the hock compared with dorsolateral aspect of thehock and the entire bevel of a 20- or a 22-gaugeneedle does not completely enter the DIT joint com-partment medially. This, in part, causes some ofthe medication to be administered into subcutane-ous tissue when the medial approach is used. As mentioned previously, it is the authors' expe- rience that the TMT joint is treated alone based onfamiliarity and ease of performing an arthrocentesisof the TMT joint coupled with the lack of familiarityand ease of arthrocentesis of the DIT joint. In theauthors' experience it is not uncommon to performintra-articular blocking, with a low volume (2-4mL) of 2% mepivacaine, into the TMT joint spaceonly and get a signicant improvement in lamenesswhen horses have distal tarsal pain. Subsequent tothis, with the thought that medication has similardiffusion rates between the TMT and DIT joints andthe TMT joint is routinely an easier joint to inject,only the TMT joint is treated. The diffusion of low-molecular-weight products (i.e., methylprednisoloneacetate, triamcinolone acetate, and mepivacaine)across adjacent joint space has been reported to be100%. 7,8When a horse signicantly improves after diagnostic anesthesia to the TMT joint alone, it is the authors' belief that diffusion of mepivacainemost likely reaches analgesic levels into the DITjoint compartment. The authors' clinical experi-ence has led them to believe the diffusion of HA (high molecular weight) and TA (low molecularweight) exists between the TMT and DIT joints butdoes not reach therapeutic levels, except when com-munication naturally occurs (8-35%). 13This belief has stemmed from the fact that it is not uncommon for horses to present for lameness with a history ofhaving only the TMT joint therapeutically treated.In these cases, a large percentage of horses willsignicantly improve after intra-articular block-ing of the DIT joint alone and become sound aftertherapeutically treating DIT joint alone. Subse-quently, clients become frustrated with the factthat the previous treatment did not resolve thelameness and they have to pay for treatment of thesame area. Clients often make the comment thatthe previous clinician either did not get the needleinto the joint or used the wrong medication. Forthese reasons, the authors' always therapeuticallytreat the TMT and DIT separately with HA andTA using the dorsolateral approach and radio-graphic guidance to the DIT joint in an effort toeliminate any doubt, in the clinician's and owner's mind, that the medication was administered intothe desired compartment. Disadvantages to the described technique include at least one extra person to perform radiographs,potential damage to equipment, a digital radiographmachine, and puncture of the dorsal pedal vein ortarsal artery. In the authors' practice a single per-son (Fig. 3) routinely holds the radiograph machineand digital plate to take the radiograph. Two peo-ple may be needed depending on technician experi-ence, strength, and equipment being used. To date,the authors have no knowledge of any complicationsfrom puncture of the dorsal pedal vein or tarsalartery. In the authors' experience, when the arteryor vein is punctured, further advancement of theneedle through the vein or artery almost alwaysguarantees the needle is at the level of the DIT jointspace. In conclusion, naturally occurring communication between the TMT and DIT joint has been shown tobe infrequent; therefore, for practical purposes, theclinician should assume the TMT and DIT joints donot communicate when diagnosing and therapeuti-cally treating horses with distal tarsal pain. Whenperforming arthrocentesis of the DIT joint, no mat-ter which approach is used, a radiograph should betaken to identify needle location. A dorsolateralapproach with radiographic guidance eliminatesdoubt as to where the needle is positioned. Advan-tages to the dorsolateral approach using radiographguidance provides easier palpable landmarks,ability to use clinician-preferred needle, a higher-quality standard of care, and safer approach toperforming arthrocentesis of the DIT joint com-pared with the medialapproach.

The objectives were to describe exter-nal landmarks and to determine the accuracy ofthe technique for inexperienced and experiencedinjectors. The authors hypothesized that thissingle-needle technique would have high accuracy(/H1102280%) for successful injection of all three joint compartments. 2.

Twenty-four cadaver stifles were placed in a customizedstand at an angle determined from live horses innormal square stance. Each joint compartmentwas injected with a solution containing contrastmedia, tap water, and dye. Following injection,radiographs and gross dissection were completedto determine success of entering each joint com- partment.

Introduction Equine pain management is one of the most chal-lenging issues veterinarians face on a daily basis.With our increased understanding of the underlyingmechanisms causing various types of pain comes aneed to develop more directed multimodal pain man-agement protocols. Administration anti-nervegrowth factor (anti-NGF mAb) in nonequine specieshas a signicant analgesic effect. 2. Materials and Methods This nonterminal study used 24 horses and createda transient mild synovitis in one randomly selectedtarsocrural joint. Each horse received a single intra- articular injection of equine recombinant interleu-kin-1 beta (reIL-1 /H9252), an equivalent amount of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solutionwas injected into the contra-lateral joint. administered intra-articularly hours synovitis into the reIL-1 /H9252- and PBS- treated joints. Treatment groups consisted of anti-NGF mAb dose 1 (0.1 mg), dose 2 (1 mg), dose 3 (10mg), or placebo. Synovial fluid, lameness evalua-tion, and ground-reaction forces were collected atthree different time points. Standing arthroscopywas used to collect tissue biopsies from the tarsocru-ral joint 10 hours after synovitis induction. 3. Results The 1-mg and 10-mg doses produced signicantdisease-modifying effects with a reduction in synovial membrane intimal hyperplasia, synovial fluid with reIL-1 /H9252placebo treatment. Signicant clinical improvements with less pain demonstratedduring hock flexion and a symmetrical loading of thelimb were produced at the 10-mg dose.

Introduction The bisphosphonates tiludronateaand clodronateb were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-istration (FDA) in 2014 for \"the control of clinicalsigns associated navicular syndrome inhorses.\" 1Both are non-nitrogen-containing bispho - sphonates that have been used in humans for thetreatment of osteoporosis as they influence bone re-modeling toward an increase in bone mass and me-chanical strength. 1The use of bisphosphonates among equine practitioners seems to be controver- sial with many having strong opinions for or againstthe use of these drugs in equines. Questions remainregarding the best choice of bisphosphonate, fre-quency, route and dose of administration, minimum age of the horse to be treated, what type of conditionsmay benet from treatment, and how to select the bestcandidates for successful bisphosphonate treatment.This paper provides a review of the pharmacokinetics,mechanisms of action, adverse effects, and specicsabout different routes of administration of bisphospho-nates in horses and other species to allow the equinepractitioner to make educated choices when consider-ing treating a patient with bisphosphonates.2. Pharmakokinetics After IV or IM administration, non-nitrogenous bis- phosphonates localize primarily in bone, but smallamounts can also be found in the kidneys, liver, andspleen. 2The majority of the systemic dose is, how - ever, excreted via the kidneys, which likely explainspotential nephrotoxicity of bisphosphonates. Inthe bone, bisphosphonates bind with a very highafnity to hydroxyapatite crystals (bone mineral).They seem to be absorbed especially well at sites ofactive bone resorption, where bone mineral is mostexposed. Here, bisphosphonates remain until be-ing liberated via slowed bony resorption. Thus, thehalf-life of bisphosphonates in bone depends on theafnity to calcium of the specic bisphosphonate and on the rate of bone turnover, but has been describedfor alendronate to be 3 years for dogs, 3more than 10 years for humans,4and 300 days was reported as bone half-life for pamidronate in rats.5Unfortu - nately, no data are available for horses, but theauthor's opinion is that half-life within bone is likelyto be variable depending on location within the skel-eton and presence or absence of pathologically in-creased bone turnover. Thus, regions with normal AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 371THERIOGENOLOGY AND LAMENESS NOTESturnover may contain at time as regions with abnormally high turnoverhave cleared bisphosphonates. 3. Mechanisms of Action In the opinion of the author, it is imperative tofamiliarize oneself with the unique mechanisms ofaction of bisphosphonates, given that they can ex-plain adverse effects and knowledge of the mecha-nisms of action allows veterinarians to make betterclinical decisions where data in horses is lacking.The mechanisms of action of non-nitrogenous bis-phosphonates have been investigated extensively. 6 They inhibit bone resorption mostly via a cellularmechanism on osteoclasts. Osteoclasts take upbisphosphonates the non-nitrogenous bisphosphonates are then incorporatedinto toxic ATP are to hydro-lysis. This disrupts energy-dependent cellularfunctions of the bone resorption. Inter-estingly, non-nitrogenous bisphosphonate-induced apoptosis, possibly explaining why thesebisphosphonates have not been as effective in someinflammatory models of bone loss with high levels ofTNF /H9251.7,8Besides these direct effects on oste - oclasts, bisphosphonates also interfere with oste-oclast formation and maturation, 9-11an aspect that may be important to reflect upon when considering using bisphosphonates in growing or immatureanimals. More recently, it has been shown that bisphospho- nates, at levels provided by therapeutic systemicdoses, also have anti-apoptotic effects on osteocytesand osteoblasts. 12This seems counterintuitive, but can be explained by being mediated via a dif- ferent mechanism of action than the one causingapoptosis in osteoclasts. At low concentrations, bi-sphosphonates bind to a protein on the outer cellmembrane (connexin 43 hemichannel), which acti-vates apoptosis osteocytes andosteoblasts. 12This may be another mechanism how bisphosphonates, at levels provided by thera- peutic systemic doses, decrease bone breakdown,given that osteocyte apoptosis is a signal for bonyremodeling. 13 Clinically, bisphosphonates seem to normalize bone turnover in conditions where there is an abnor-mal increase in bone resorption. They seem toachieve this by decreasing bone resorption and al-lowing normal bone formation to occur. 14In sup - port of these statements, tiludronate at 1 mg/kg IVas a single dose has been shown to decrease bio-markers for bone resorption carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type bone formation(osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase) in normal horses.4. Effects Adverse effects or undesired effects of bisphospho- nate use have been and are still debated in length inthe human medical eld, but have not received thesame attention among the veterinary medical com-munity, at least not in the peer-reviewed literature.In humans, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been a puz-zling, severe adverse effect of bisphosphonate use,especially when administered intravenously to pa-tients with cancer. However, patients receiving bi-sphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis mayalso experience this complication, especially if otherrisk factors, such as corticosteroid use, alcohol con-sumption, immunosuppressive therapy, autoim-mune diseases, hematologic/thrombotic disorders,diabetes mellitus, or renal failure are present. 17 To the author's knowledge, osteonecrosis of the jawhas so far not been reported in horses, but it isimportant to be aware of its association with bispho-sphonate use in humans. Another severe complication of bisphosphonate use in humans is the occurrence of atypical femoralfractures. 18These are thought to be fatigue or stress fractures, and it has been proposed that con- tinued bisphosphonate administration results inalteration of the normal remodeling response, of osteoclastic bony resorption followed byosteoblastic bone formation. 19This results in de - creased heterogeneity of bone mineral and matrixproperties and accumulation of local microdamage,which translates into deterioration of mechanicalproperties of the bone, especially at sites of maxi-mum mechanical forces. Although there are noreports of atypical fractures in horses after bispho- sphonate use, it is important for veterinarians torealize that similar complications could occur inhorses especially after repeated bisphosphonate use.Renal toxicity is a well-known adverse effect of bis-phosphonate use in humans, and the author knowsof multiple equine cases in which there is an anec-dotal link to bisphosphonate administration. Bothtiludronate and clodronate are labeled with state-ments not to use them in horses with a history of orcurrent renal disease. Both also have statementsto avoid concurrent administration of NSAIDs (ti-ludronate) 20or to approach the \"concurrent admin - istration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs...with caution and renal function should be moni-tored\" (clodronate). 21In tiludronate's FDA ap - proval study, horses treated with flunixinafter tiludronate injection showed signicantlyhigher serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen calcium and magnesium levels compared withpre-treatment values, and 32% of horses had serumcreatinine levels above the reference range but re-turned to the reference range 2 weeks post-treat- ment. 20In horses that were treated only with tiludronate, 2% had elevated serum creatinine clodronate (1.4 mg/kgIM), serum creatinine, BUN and potassium levels /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY AND LAMENESSwere not signicantly increased compared with pre-treatment values in any of the study horses. 21 When clodronate (1.8 mg/kg IM) was administeredafter 3 days of phenylbutazone treatment at 4.4mg/kg twice daily and followed by 3 days of phenyl-butazone at 2.2 mg/kg twice daily, serum creatinineconcentrations remained within the reference range,but BUN concentration increased compared withpretreatment values. Renal toxicity due to bispho-sphonates is likely associated with renal excretion ofthe bisphosphonate. With high local bisphospho-nate concentrations in the kidneys, cells likely willtake up the drug and go into apoptosis. Thus, inthe author's opinion, administration of lower dosesor over a longer period may help to decrease renaltoxicity. Gastrointestinal pain is also a common adverse effect of systemic administration of bisphosphonatesin horses. Although there is little mention of thisin the peer-reviewed literature, colic associated withIV infusion of tiludronate was seen in 58% of horsestreated with tiludronate at 1 mg/kg in 1 L saline,administered over 30 minutes, in 28% of horseswhen the administration time was extended to 60minutes and in 44% of horses when the administra-tion time was extended to 90 or 120 minutes. 20 Fewer than half of the horses experiencing colicrequired medical therapy, and duration of colic signswas 7 minutes to 6 12hours (mean, 81 min). In horses treated medically for signs of colic, thesesigns resolved within 15 minutes after initiation ofcolic treatment (including N-butylscopolamine, xy-lazine, detomidine, butorphanol, and flunixin, latter recommended). After IMinjection of clodronate at 1.4 mg/kg with a maximumdose of 900 mg, 9% of horses exhibited colic signsimmediately post-treatment. However, horses ex-hibiting just a single sign of colic, such as pawing,pacing, agitation or depression were not counted asshowing signs of colic. Only 0.9% of all horses re-quired medical treatment (flunixin and dexametha-sone, which is in the author's opinion not to berecommended) to resolve colic signs as well asheaves associated with clodronate treatment. 21 Colic signs occurred from 1 to 226 minutes postin-jection and all had resolved within 5 12hours post injection. In the author's opinion, a horse exhibit-ing signs of colic after bisphosphonate treatmentshould rst be walked and if this does not resolvesigns, N-butylscopolamine, xylazine, detomidine, butorphanol, or a combination of these drugs shouldbe given. Other, less-frequent adverse effects in these stud- ies 20,21were injection site swelling, frequent urina - tion, muscle fasciculations, inappetence, anorexia,stiff neck, and fever for tiludronate and lip licking,yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling,hives, and pruritus for clodronate. One horse that was conrmed to be a heterozy- gous carrier of the hyperkalemic periodic paralysis(HYPP) gene died after becoming colicky post-tiludronate infusion and receiving a dose of an un- known NSAID and xylazine. This horse had severehyperkalemia, moderate hypercalcemia, mildazotemia, and signs of hemoconcentration. Thepresumptive cause of death after necropsy was car-diac arrest due to hyperkalemia. 20In the author's opinion, it is important to discuss a possible in- creased risk for an HYPP episode with owners ofcarriers, and electrolyte status of horses with musclefasciculations or signs of colic that do not resolvewith walking should be determined to allow for ap-propriate treatment. 5. Clinical Use in Horses Use of IV-Administered Tiludronate for Treatment of Navicular Syndrome There is evidence that IV-administered tiludronate is benecial for some cases with navicular syn-drome. 22,23Based on a placebo- controlled trial, 22 horses with moderate-to-severe lameness (2-5 of 5 grade lame on American Associ-ation of Equine Practitioners [AAEP] scale), positiveinterphalangeal extension test, positive palmar dig-ital nerve block, and classic radiographic signs ofnavicular disease may benet from treatment withtiludronate (0.1 mg/kg four times daily for 10 con-secutive days, resulting in a total dose of 1 mg/kgtiludronate), especially if their clinical signs oc-curred less than 6 months prior to initiation of treat-ment. Horses with signs of lameness of more than6 months duration seemed to need two or threetreatments 2 months apart. Improvement in lame-ness was reported in almost 70% of horses, andresolution of lameness was reported in 50% of horses6 12months after treatment. The decision to repeat treatment was made based on lack of improvement 2months after the initial treatment. Another studyreported that horses' lameness due to navicular syn-drome improved 120 and 200 days after tiludronatetreatment (1 mg/kg IV), but none of the horses be-came sound. 23All horses received trimming \"for balance\" by an experienced farrier throughout the study period. In the author's opinion, these studiesshow that it may take a long time for tiludronate toprovide pain relief in horses with navicular syn-drome, and the inclusion of appropriate shoeing maybe necessary to improve outcomes. They also showthat response to treatment can be quite variable.The FDA approval study, although not peer re-viewed, also supports the effectiveness of intrave-nously administered tiludronate (1 todecrease lameness due to navicular syndrome insome horses. 20To be included in this study, horses had to be at least 4 years of age, the cause of lame- ness had to be navicular syndrome based on lame-ness examination including response to palmardigital nerve block, bone edema of the medullarycavity of the navicular bone, and no major soft tissueinvolvement on magnetic resonance imaging exam-ination. Further, horses had to be a grade 2-3 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 373THERIOGENOLOGY AND LAMENESSlame AAEP lameness scale and had to be freeof renal disease. Most horses were lame for fewerthan 6 months at the time of treatment and allhorses received \"corrective shoeing\" as part of thetreatment. At 2 months post-treatment, 64% oftreated horses had improved at least by 1 lamenessgrade on their predominantly lame limb and had notworsened in the other limb (vs 48% of placebohorses). Use of IM-Administered Clodronate for Treatment of Navicular Syndrome There is no peer-reviewed information available onthe effects of clodronate administration on horseswith navicular syndrome. The FDA approvalstudy 21supports effectiveness in decreasing lame - ness due to navicular syndrome after IM injection ofclodronate (1.4 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 900mg) in some horses without making shoeing changesin these horses. To be included in this study,horses had to be at least 4 years of age, the cause oflameness had to be navicular syndrome based onlameness examination including response to palmardigital nerve block, bony changes that were charac-teristic for navicular disease on radiographs, ab-sence of other lesions on radiographs, and noshoeing changes within 2 weeks prior to treatment.At 56 days post-treatment, 75% of treated horseshad improved at least by 1 lameness grade on theirpredominantly lame limb and had not worsened inthe other limb (vs 3% of placebo horses). At 180days after treatment, 85% of the horses considered asuccess at 56 days were still improved by at least 1lameness grade on their predominantly lame limband had not worsened in the other limb. However,41% of these were more lame than at the 56-daytime point, indicating that the treatment effectmay have decreased between 2 and 6 months post-treatment. The overall success rate at 180 dayswas 65% of treated horses. Conclusion From Studies for Tiludronate and Clodronate In the author's opinion, there is currently no evi-dence that either tiludronate or clodronate is moreefcacious than the other in relieving pain due tonavicular syndrome in horses, although the twostudies had signicant differences in study design(magnetic resonance imaging, incorporation of shoe-ing changes, denition of colic). 6. Extra-Label Bisphosphonate Use Extra-Label Routes of Administration of Tiludronate The relatively high cost of the drug, adverse effectsencountered at the dose of 1 mg/kg IV, and anecdotalreports of greater efcacy for more targeted routes ofadministration have presumably resulted in veteri-narians administering tiludronate via intra-articular (IA) injections or via IV regional limb per-fusion (RLP). This is despite very little informationabout appropriate dosing regimens, safety, or ef-cacy of these practices. When attempting to predict possible effects of administration of tiludronate viaIA injections or RLP, it is important to understandthe concentration-dependent effects of bisphospho-nates on cells in bone and cartilage, as well as othermusculoskeletal tissues, given that the more tar-geted routes of administration will invariably resultin some kind of effect on joint tissues other thanbone, due to relatively high synovial fluid concentra-tions attained via IA injection or RLP. In vitroexperiments on articular cartilage explants 24 showed that concentrations of tiludronate that couldbe expected after administration of 50 mg of tiludro-nate into a joint with a volume of 30 mL (tibiotarsalor femorotibial joints) increased release of glycos-aminoglycans (GAG) from cartilage matrix as wellas chondrocyte apoptosis in normal and GAG release and chondrocyte apoptosis. These re-sults raise concern about the current practice of IAinjections or RLP with high doses of tiludronate.However, they also suggest that at the right dose,tiludronate may be benecial in the treatment ofosteoarthritis or navicular disease when given viamore targeted routes. In another study, 25four horses' middle carpal joints were injected with a dose of tiludronate de- signed to reach safe and efcacious levels in thesynovial fluid (dose of 0.17 mg tiludronate IA).Four different horses' middle carpal joints were in-jected with 50 mg tiludronate to reflect the anecdot-ally used dose and this dose generated synovial fluidtiludronate concentrations exceeding those consid-ered safe for articular cartilage in vitro ( /H113491900 ng/mL) for at least 48 hours after IA injection.This was accompanied by increased synovial fluidtotal solids concentration, suggesting an inflamma-tory response, as well as an increase in synovial fluidGAG concentration, resulting from increased carti-lage matrix degradation. Nevertheless, 14 days af-ter treatment, GAG content in articular cartilagewas not found to be different between joints treatedwith the high dose of tiludronate and control joints,although this may reflect the small number of horsesinvestigated. Although it seems that IA injection of50 mg tiludronate into middle carpal joints ofhealthy horses results in a transient inflammatoryresponse and GAG release from articular cartilage,it is uncertain whether this practice has any long-term negative effects on joint health. In the au-thor's opinion, the repeated IA use of higher doses oftiludronate may have more detrimental effects thanwhat was reported in this study. In another study, 26IV RLP was performed on one forelimb of six horses with a dose of tiludronate (0.5 mg diluted with saline to 50 mL) designed to reachsafe levels in the synovial fluid. Six other horseshad RLP of one forelimb with 50 mg tiludronate(diluted with saline to 50 mL). All contralateralforelimbs received RLP with 50 mL saline to serve 374 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY AND LAMENESSas control limbs. Similar to other studies investi-gating synovial fluid disposition of medications ad-ministered via IV RLP, synovial fluid concentrationsof tiludronate were of tiludronate, synovial fluid tiludronate con-centration exceeded concentrations articular cartilage in vitro ( /H113491900 ng/mL) in two of the six cofn joints. There was no differencebetween treated and control limbs in synovial fluidtotal solids concentration at any time in any syno-vial structure, and GAGs were not measured in thisstudy due to the small volumes of synovial fluidsamples obtained. Interestingly, RLP with tiludronate (0.1 mg/kg) in horses with navicular syndrome failed to improvelameness over a time period of 200 days, whereassystemic administration (1 mg/kg tiludronate IV)improved lameness in a similar ofhorses. 23In the author's opinion, higher doses for RLP may provide better clinical response, but the safety of higher doses for cartilage and other tissueswithin the perfused area needs to be establishedbefore higher doses are being used by veterinarians. In conclusion, IA injections and RLP with tiludro- nate will have dose-dependent effects dosing regimens need to bedeveloped based on scientic principles. Until thatgoal is achieved, these routes of administration can-not be recommended. 7. Bisphosphonate Administration to Manage Osteoarthritis The usefulness of bisphosphonate treatment to man-age lameness due to osteoarthritis is not necessarilyintuitive, given that bisphosphonates influence boneremodeling toward an increase in bone mass andmechanical strength, 1and other than in certain types of osteoarthritis (such as bone spavin, for ex- ample), osteoarthritis in horses is typically associ-ated with subchondral bone sclerosis, rather thanlysis. Thus, the question may arise why one woulduse a class of drugs that decreases bone resorptionin conditions that are radiographically character-ized by already too much bone? The short answerto this is that other than in late-stage osteoarthritis,remodeling (which is the coordinated removal ofbone by osteoclasts, followed by the formation ofsecondary bone by osteoblasts in the same location)of the subchondral bone is accelerated with osteoar-thritis. 27,28There is also evidence pointing toward this acceleration in bone remodeling being a major culprit in the progression of osteoarthritis.29Thus, bisphosphonates have the potential to slow progres- sion of osteoarthritis by normalizing the acceleratedbone remodeling in the subchondral bone area ofosteoarthritic joints. It is likely that bisphospho-nates are more effective when administered early inthe disease process, given that bone remodeling ac-tually is slowed down in late-stage osteoarthri-tis. 27,28In the author's opinion, this is probably one major reason for inconsistent results of studiesinvestigating the effects of bisphosphonate therapy on osteoarthritis in experimental animal studiesand human clinical trials. Tiludronate has been shown in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials to improve pain dueto osteoarthritis of the thoracolumbar facet joints 30 and bone spavin31in some horses. Briefly, horses with reduction in thoracolumbar movement during passive mobility or while trottingor cantering, no or minimal lameness, and radio-graphic signs of osteoarthritis if the facet joints inthe thoracolumbar region with or without radio-graphic lesions of the dorsal spinous processes mayshow an increase in dorsal mobility especially at acanter with tiludronate treatment (1 mg/kg IV).In the study, more than 60% of treated horses wereconsidered to have responded positively 60 days af-ter treatment, whereas almost 30% of placebotreated horses were considered to have respondedpositively. It is important to note that the vari-ables used to determine positive response were sub-jective assessments. Similarly to the navicularstudy, 22horses that failed to respond 60 days after the rst tiludronate treatment were administered a second treatment and two of three horses did im-prove 60 days after the second treatment. Tiludronate administered systemically (1 mg/kg IV) has also been shown to improve lameness due tobone spavin in some horses to a greater degree thana placebo did. 31Included horses had been lame for 2-12 months, and had had limited treatments for their condition. Lameness improved over 2-4months post-treatment, and horses with a less-severe lameness prior to treatment seemed to be theones that attained soundness at the end of the study. Although veterinarians anecdotally use bisphos- phonates to manage osteoarthritis of many otherjoints in horses, it is important to educate horseowners about the fact that this is an extra-label useof the medications and that there is no peer-reviewed evidence available for their effectiveness inconditions other than the ones discussed above.This does not mean that they cannot be effective, butat this time, there is insufcient evidence to makesuch a statement. 8. Bisphosphonates to Prevent Disuse Osteopenia Tiludronate administered at 1 mg/kg diluted in 1 Lsaline given IV over 30-60 minutes was able toprevent a decrease in bone mineral density due tocast immobilization in horses. 32Lameness ob - served immediately after cast removal (grade 3-4/5,AAEP lameness scale) was not influenced by tiludro-nate administration. Thus, in the author's opinion,bisphosphonate administration may be a reasonableadjunctive treatment in cases that need prolongedcast immobilization to prevent loss in bone mineraldensity, which is thought to decrease bone strength. If the cast is applied to aid in fracture healing or after surgical arthrodesis of a joint, the questionarises whether previous or current bisphosphonate AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 375THERIOGENOLOGY AND LAMENESSuse may be detrimental to formation of a bonyunion, because osteoclast activity is an integral partof fracture repair. To the author's knowledge,there are no studies on the effects of bisphospho-nates in horses with experimentally induced frac-tures. Furthermore, results from human reportsare difcult to extrapolate to equines, because mosthumans treated with bisphosphonates have bonediseases that may affect fracture healing in the rstplace, such as osteoporosis. In the author's opin-ion, only studies on animals with normal bone ho-meostasis should be used to attempt to gatherinformation about whether bisphosphonate use isdetrimental in equine fracture patients. Based onone review article 33and two meta-analyses,34,35one may conclude that bisphosphonate administration shortly before or after fracture occurrence is un-likely to affect indirect or secondary fracture healingnegatively: while bisphosphonates seem to resultin a larger callus and delayed remodeling of wovenbone to lamellar bone within the callus, biomechani-cal properties of the callus do not seem to be inferior.In contrast with this, bisphosphonate use in director primary bone healing resulted in biomechanicallyinferior healing of osteotomy sites. 36In the au - thor's opinion, the use of bisphosphonates in horseswith fractures or surgical arthrodesis needs to beinvestigated before clinical application can beadvised. A decrease in bone mineral density may also occur during lay-up periods in athletic horses, and suchperiods have been associated with an increased riskof certain catastrophic fractures once training andracing is resumed. It is unknown whether admin-istration of a bisphosphonate would decrease or in-crease the incidence of catastrophic fractures afterlay-up periods. 9. Bisphosphonates for the Treatment of the Bucked Shins Complex A non-peer-reviewed report37described the use of tiludronate (via IV RLP), and exercise modication in the dorsal aspect of thethird metacarpal bone and radiographic evidence ofa stress fracture or periosteal remodeling and boneloss in that area. Five horses were treated with 50mg tiludronate via IV RLP (total volume of 60 mL,perfused for 30 min) every 2 weeks for three treat-ments, extracorporeal shock wave application(5-mm trode, 1000 pulses at energy level 6 c) every week for six treatments and exercise restriction to 10 minutes of hand-walking daily for the rst week,which was gradually increased to jogging on thetrack for 1.5 miles by the sixth week. All horsesraced after this regimen within a range of 2.5-5months after diagnosis without recurrence of theproblem. The report also showed radiographic res-olution or improvement of changes in the dorsalmetacarpus at the 6-week mark in two cases. Al-though this report is intriguing, there was no controlgroup, and it was not peer reviewed. Thus, it is to date unknown whether the use of tiludronate wasbenecial, given that multiple treatment modalitieswere employed. It is also unknown whether ti-ludronate in these cases was safe in the long run.In other species, it has been shown that bisphospho-nate use in fracture patients or experimentally in-duced fractures results in an increase in callus size,given that the initial anabolic bone response is notresorption dependent, and the later, resorption-dependent remodeling response is reduced. 38Rec- ommendations for human patients who are beingtreated with bisphosphonates and that incur a frac-ture are to continue bisphosphonate treatment forthe original condition (such as osteoporosis) unlessprimary bone repair is the anticipated method offracture healing. In fact, bisphosphonate treat- ment after fracture creation has resulted in signi-cant increases in mineralized callus size andstrength in some studies of experimental fracturemodels compared with saline controls. 38 10. Other Musculoskeletal Conditions That May Possibly Benet From Bisphosphonate Administration In the authors' opinion, nonseptic pedal osteitis and sesamoiditis may be conditions that possibly benetfrom a decrease in bone remodeling, but no informa-tion is available on the use of bisphosphonates inthese conditions. 11. Remaining Open Questions How May Clodronate or Tiludronate Administration Affect Skeletal Development in Growing Horses? All equine-specic studies were performed in skele- tally mature horses, so one must turn to studies inother species. There are currently no guidelines foruse of bisphosphonates in human pediatric patientsand their use in children is controversial because oflack of safety data, but nevertheless, they are usedto treat genetic or acquired disorders that are asso-ciated with osteoporosis and fracture developmentin children. 39 One complication is the development of a ra- diodense transverse line in the area of the metaph-yses, adjacent to an active physis, correspondingwith radiographic is how-ever unknown, given that these lines disappear withtime (range, 2-8 y). It is unknown whether similarradiographic ndings occur in foals treated withbisphosphonates. It seems that bisphosphonate exposure of the hu- man fetus due to therapeutic doses for the mothersresult in only marginal decreases in gestationallength and birth weight, although transient neona-tal electrolyte abnormalities seem to be more clini-cally signicant. 41To date, no long-term health consequences of human fetal exposure to bisphos- 376 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY AND LAMENESSphonates have been reported, but none of the studiesperformed long-term follow-up on the infants. In growing laboratory animals, bisphosphonate administration was associated with a transient dis-ruption of physeal microscopic morphology, reten-tion of cartilaginous remnants in cortical bone,and a mild decrease in tibial length. 42Thus, bis - phosphonates seem to affect endochondral ossica-tion, but it is unclear whether this has any lastingeffects. How Long Are Tiludronate or Clodronate Decreasing Bone Turnover After Administration? Is This Dependent onExercise, Age of the Animal, or Other Factors? Is itImportant to Obtain a Sustained Decrease in BoneTurnover for Therapeutic Effectiveness? The answers to these questions remain open. Thebone resorption marker CTX-1 (a peptide that iscleaved off type I collagen by osteoclasts during boneresorption) was measured up to 60 days after treat-ment of horses with either a single dose of tiludro-nate at 1 mg/kg IV or with 10 daily doses oftiludronate at 0.1 mg/kg IV. 16Signicant de - creases were seen only transiently within the rst 3days after treatment was started in either group.This study was performed in sound horses that werenot exercised, and CTX-1 response in horses intraining with musculoskeletal diseases that affectbone turnover may be different. One could con-clude from this study that sustained suppression ofCTX-1 may not be necessary to obtain a treatmenteffect after IV tiludronate administration, but toprove or disprove this statement, measurements ofCTX-1 in horses with navicular disease before andafter treatment with bisphosphonates would need tobe performed. Where Does the Dosing Regimen to Treat Every 2 Months Come From? The author is not certain how this dosing regimenwas derived, but an abstract presented at the NinthInternational Congress of the European Associationfor Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology 43sug- gested that radioactivity from radioactively labeledtiludronate in equine bones decreased relatively lit-tle for the rst 3 months after administration at 1mg/kg IV, and then decreased more rapidly 3-6months after administration. Based on extrapola-tion from data in rats it was concluded that tiludro-nate concentrations in equine bone at 6 months wereprobably not high enough to inhibit bone resorptionby 50%. 12. Summary A subset of horses with lameness due to navicularsyndrome seems to improve after IV administrationof tiludronate or IM administration of clodronate,but resolution of lameness may not be achieved. Assessment of response should be performed 2-6 months post-treatment and in horses with failure toimprove, an additional treatment may result in im-proved lameness. Horses with a lameness history of less than 6 months are more likely to respond totreatment. Bisphosphonates can be nephrotoxic and a renal panel should be obtained prior to treatment.Horses with compromised kidney function arepoor candidates for bisphosphonate treatment dueto likely worsening of the condition. Bisphosphonates should not be administered con- currently with NSAIDs or other nephrotoxic drugs.Colic is the most common adverse effect of bisphos-phonate administration, but most horses improvewith walking only. If medical treatment is war-ranted, N-butylscopolamine, xylazine, detomidine orbutorphanol, or a mixture of these can be used.NSAID administration is not recommended. Bisphosphonate administration may be associated with HYPP episodes in heterozygotes, although theFDA did not come to the same conclusion. No in-formation is available for safety of bisphosphonatetreatment in homozygous carriers. The author rec-ommends analyzing the electrolyte status of horseswith muscle fasciculations and/or colic signs that donot resolve with walking exercise. According to the FDA approval studies, tiludro- nate administration (1 mg/kg i n 1 L saline IV over 60-90 min) may be accompanied more often withcolic signs or alterations of clinical pathologic vari-ables of kidney function and electrolyte homeostasisthan clodronate administration (1.4 mg/kg up to 900mg total distributed into three different injectionsites), but these studies were not peer reviewed andtheir description is incomplete in the FDA Freedomof Information Summaries. Administration of bisphosphonates via routes other than what is approved by the FDA may not beinnocuous or clinically effective and is not currentlyrecommended.

A study evaluating operatorexposure conrmed the benets of shielding, but theradiographic exposure techniques used were higherthan typical, and exposure to personnel holding cas-settes was not evaluated. The hypotheses of thisstudy were radiation exposure from a handheld gen-erator would be lower with than without lead shield-ing, and exposure would be higher to the cassetteholder than to the generator operator. The objec-tives of this study were to compare scatter radiationexposures to personnel using a handheld generatorwith and without shielding. 2. Materials and Methods A cadaveric hindlimb was suspended to mimic stand-ing position. Two dosimeters were placed at six loca-tions from the generator and cassette to mimic locations of hands, trunk, and eyes-thyroid of person-nel. One dosimeter was unshielded and the otherwas shielded at each location. Twenty exposureswere made of each projection. Shielding techniqueswere compared using the Wilcoxon sign-rank test. 3. Results Exposures for the operator and holder withoutshielding were signicantly higher than with shield-ing. Relative exposure for the holder was signi-cantly greater than for the operator. A largenumber of radiographic studies are necessary toreach the annual maximum exposure. 4. Discussion Radiation exposure is signicantly higher withoutthan with shielding.

Introduction Veterinarians can be quick to purchase the latestequipment without considering important businessaspects of such purchases. Equipment purchasescan be emotionally driven or driven by a real orperceived need to keep up with competitors. End-of-the-tax-year specials at trade shows can also con-tribute to emotional decision making. Poorlythought out purchase decisions can lead to under-utilization and inadequate cost capture of newequipment or development of new services. This lecture will cover important aspects of de- cision making when considering adding newequipment or services. Regardless of the type ofservice or equipment being added, the decision-making process is similar. One must considerpricing, opportunity cost, and training amongother factors when deciding whether to purchasenew or replacement equipment. Important con-cepts of capacity, white space, branding, andbreak-even analysis will be presented as they re-late to such decisions. Attendees should gain abetter appreciation of the decision-making processwhen faced with decisions to add or replace equip-ment or services.2. Should I Add New Equipment/Service? The concept of opportunity cost is one of the rst concepts taught in business schools. Opportunitycost considers what you could be doing (earning) ifyou were doing something else with your time ormoney. Although it may sound straightforward,opportunity cost is often overlooked. For example,you are considering the purchase of a new ultra-sound machine. You own an old portable unitthat is acceptable for reproductive use, but littleelse. You plan to keep that machine for repro-duction and purchase a new machine for muscu-loskeletal (MSK) exams. Multiple opportunity costs must be considered: Opportunity Cost of Your Time What could you do if you were not performing anMSK ultrasound exam? Do you have time to addMSK ultrasound exams into your work day? Orwill adding this service affect your ability to dosomething else from a time standpoint? This re-lates to capacity in your practice. If the answer isyes to the latter, then you will have to give some-thing up during your practice day to perform thatultrasound exam. Perhaps this means one less AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 381THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TRANSITIONS FOR PRACTICE GROWTH NOTESlameness exam, one less dental, three less radio-graphic studies, seeing the next scheduled patienton time, etc. The next step is to consider what youwould charge for performing those alternative tasksthat you would be giving up. If you can earn moreperforming those tasks, and there is more demandfor these tasks than MSK ultrasound, then perhapspurchasing a new ultrasound machine is not thebest choice from a protability standpoint. Opportunity costs also relate to pricing of the ul- trasound exam. Let's say, for example, in order tospend an hour from start to nish to perform a MSKultrasound exam (time to set up, scan, communicatendings to clients, cleanup), you would have to giveup an hour doing three radiographic studies whereyou could gross $450 (assumption /H11005$150/study). From a business standpoint, this is the price youshould charge for your ultrasound exam. However,this price would probably be beyond most clients'willingness to pay for an ultrasound exam, at leastin most areas of the country. Admittedly, this is afairly simplistic approach and you should consideryour hourly gross in this thought process as well.Given that ultrasound exams tend to take longerthan other types of exams, it is likely that yourhourly gross could decline if you add MSK ultra-sound to your practice. It is however also recog-nized that your clients may expect that your practicecan perform such exams, especially if your practicedemographic has changed from a rural to suburbanpractice. In such cases, the decision becomes some-what more complex, even if adding MSK ultrasoundmeans less time to perform other quicker, more lu-crative, veterinary services. Opportunity Cost of Capital Opportunity cost of capital relates to what could bepurchased with that same capital. In other words,would you have a higher return on investment if youspent that money on something else? This is atougher question to answer, but it is one that shouldat least be considered. Cost of training (technician andDVM) and ongoing continuing education shouldalso be considered in the opportunity cost of capital. All are capital investments. Continuing education and training is expensive, and there should be a return on your investment.Will you need a new transducer for new regions?Do you have clients requesting those exams? Couldyour skills be better developed in other areas of yourpractice? Ultrasound is highly operator dependentand consumes considerable time to become compe-tent. Clients may expect you to image any MSKregion, and ultrasound is much more operator de-pendent than radiography. To enhance your re-turn on investment, continuing education (CE)courses should be sought out to improve skill levelsin areas of greatest capacity. Even more importantto your return on investment is to ensure opportu-nities to practice once you return from the CEcourse.Other factors to consider relate to demand and ability/prociency. This is the time to be honestwith yourself when considering how many times aweek, month, or year do you recommend an ultra-sound exam of a particular region and how oftendoes a client seem amenable and willing to pay for it.Veterinarians sometimes want to add ultrasoundinto a practice that cannot support the service.It is therefore important to consider these aspects ofyour target market. Let's assume that you have clients who desire, value, and are willing to pay for such a service.You should also consider who should be performingultrasound exams within your practice or in yourpractice area. Do you have the time, energy, inter-est, and talent to develop competence? Should it beyou that ventures into ultrasound or should every-one in your practice attempt to become competent?Who has the most potential and interest level?Perhaps there is one individual in the area that onlyperforms ultrasound. In such cases, it might bemore efcient and more protable to refer to thatindividual. Does everyone in your practice area al-ready perform their own ultrasound exams? Anddo your clients seek them out because you have notoffered this service before? These questions relateto branding and the concept of white space. 3. Break-Even Analysis\u2014Basic Version Break-even analysis is commonly performed inother industries when making purchase decisions.There are many types of break-even analysis; somecomplex and some much more basic. All involveassumptions. Although there is no one right way toperform break-even analysis, some attempt shouldbe made when considering an equipment purchase,either as a replacement or when adding a new ser-vice. We will present a basic and advanced version. The basic version involves only a few assump- tions: the price of service you will be offering andthe variable costs associated with performing oneservice (exam). Variable costs include those coststhat would only be incurred because you are per-forming one more exam. For example, if you per-form one MSK ultrasound exam, the variable costswould include gel or alcohol used on that horse forthat exam, prep material, thermal paper if you printimages, per patient cost for cloud storage and thehourly rate of a technician. The veterinarian's sal-ary would not be considered given that this is a xedcost (assuming they are paid full salary). Fromthese numbers, the contribution margin can be cal-culated (price less variable costs). Contributionmargin is essentially the amount of total revenuethat can be applied toward a practice's xed costs.The purchase price of equipment is then divided bythe contribution margin to determine the number ofexams necessary before breaking even on the pur-chase (Fig. 1). Given the purchase price and vari-able cost assumptions shown in Fig. 1, break-evenon the purchase of a new transducer ($7500) would 382 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TRANSITIONS FOR PRACTICE GROWTHbe 125 exams at a price of $100 per exam. At thispoint, it is important to consider demand, ability,and willingness to pay from current and prospectiveclients in the practice area. Lack of consideration of variable costs is a com- mon mistake when determining a break-even point.Fig. 2 shows the same calculation as Fig. 1, butassumes no variable costs are incurred while per-forming the ultrasound exam. In this case, onewould errantly assume that it would only require 75exams to break even on the purchase of the trans-ducer. Although variable costs can be challengingto calculate, they are an important consideration.A rough estimate is better than none at all. Let's assume that after seeing the break-even points for the scenarios in Figs. 1 and 2, the practicedecides that your clients' willingness to pay for anabdominal ultrasound exam is underestimated.We now assume that $200 per exam is a reasonableprice. We will also consider the same amount asFig. 1 for variable costs ($40). In this scenario, 47exams are necessary to break even on the purchase of this additional transducer (Fig. 3). Although this seems enticing, it is important to consider the like-lihood that clients will pay $200 for a service notpreviously offered and realistically how many timesper week, month, or year you would have performedthis service if you had owned the transducer. Similar analysis can be used when considering adding extra transducers when purchasing a newultrasound machine. Usually, the cost of the trans-ducer is somewhat less when purchased as a pack-age deal, and it can therefore be tempting to Fig. 3. Basic break-even analysis showing the effects of increas-ing client price from $100 to $200 using the same purchase price($7500) and variable costs ($40/examination) as in Fig. 1. In thisscenario, only 47 exams are necessary to break even on thispurchase. Although this makes the purchase seem attractive,clients' willingness to pay must be considered before assumingthat this scenario will hold true within a practice. Fig. 4. Training costs associated with providing a new service(MSK ultrasound): Two CE courses are assumed necessary toacquire basic level of competence during year 1. Assumptionsare highlighted, including annual gross production, annual vaca-tion days, days on call, and costs associated with ultrasound CEcourses. This information will be used to perform the break-even analysis shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 1. Basic break-even analysis: The purchase price of anultrasound transducer to perform abdominal ultrasound is$7500. We assume a price of $100 per examination, and $40variable costs to perform one examination. Contribution mar-gin/H11005$60 (amount of sales that will contribute to xed costs). To determine the break-even point in units (scans), the purchaseprice ($7500) is divided by the contribution margin ($60). Giventhese assumptions, it would take 125 abdominal ultrasound ex-ams to break even. Fig. 2. Basic break-even analysis showing the effects of omit-ting variable costs using the same scenario as Fig. 1 (purchaseprice /H11005$7500; client price of a single examination /H11005$100). In this scenario, the same calculation shows that only 75 examswould be required to break even. Although this is still a sub-stantial number of exams, it does not account for the variablecosts involved, thereby underestimating the number of exams tobreak even on this purchase. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 383THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TRANSITIONS FOR PRACTICE GROWTHpurchase \"add-on\" probes even when there is notcurrently a need for that transducer. 4. Break-Even Analysis\u2014Advanced Concepts For those prepared for more advanced break-evenanalysis, additional factors should be considered.For this portion of the presentation, we will considerthe purchase of an ultrasound machine and assumethat the practice/veterinarian desires to expandfrom primarily reproductive ultrasound to includeMSK ultrasound. Because the practice area ischanging from primarily reproduction to sport horsepractice, they believe demand will change to supportthis type of service. The practice foresees gradualexpansion into advanced MSK ultrasound over thenext few years. This is supported by frequent re-quests of existing and new clients to perform suchprocedures. They are therefore evaluating the pur- chase of a high-end portable ultrasound machinethat includes three transducers for basic and ad-vanced MSK ultrasound and some abdominal examsfor colic referrals. Based on their experience, atleast two ultrasound CE courses are felt necessaryto develop a basic level of competence in the rstyear. Although we are using ultrasound as an ex-ample, this analysis can apply to any type of newservice. The rst consideration is the cost of training in the rst year (Fig. 4). This includes not only the directcosts associated with CE courses, but also the oppor-tunity costs associated with attending these CEcourses (i.e., revenue you would have earned hadyou not attended the course). The opportunity costin this example is 10 days of daily production, as- Fig. 5. Advanced break-even analysis considers technician and veterinarian salary, payroll taxes, time to perform one examination,xed costs, including machine and service contract costs, desired return on investment and CE/training costs (see Fig. 4), and desiredprot margin. This scenario also assumes a 5-year equipment life and evaluates how many exams per year will be necessary tobreak-even over the equipment's life; 201 annual exams are required to break even without considering prot margin and 252 annualexams are required when desired prot margin is considered. 384 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TRANSITIONS FOR PRACTICE GROWTHsuming all days away are work days. Given theseassumptions (highlighted in yellow in Fig. 4), thetotal cost of attending two CE course is $21,651.This number might seem high, but keep in mindthat it includes $14,545 of lost revenue while awayfrom the practice. This is the opportunity cost ofleaving the practice to obtain training and should beconsidered in break-even analysis. Fig. 5 shows advanced break-even analysis for the purchase of the ultrasound system (essentially theaddition of new ultrasound services). Costs con-sidered in this analysis include veterinarian andtechnician salary, payroll taxes, time to performan exam, xed costs (machine and service contractcosts amortized over 5 years), desired return oninvestment (machine and CE/training costs [seeFig. 4]) and desired prot margin. This scenarioalso assumes a 5-year equipment life. The out-put shows the number of annual exams necessaryto break even over the equipment's life (5 years)with and without consideration of desired protmargin (252 annual exams and 201 annual exams,respectively). 5. Equivalent Annual Costs\u2014Comparison of Two Possible Purchases Equivalent annual costs is a nancial exercise tocompare annual costs of two different units whenpurchase price and recurring costs differ. It is alsohelpful when the machines have different usefullives. Let's say you have narrowed your search totwo different units. Machine A is less expensivebut unlikely to last as long (3 years vs 5 years) asMachine B. Machine A has a purchase price of$20,000 and Machine B costs $35,000 dollars. Both offer a 1-year warranty with service contracts avail-able for purchase after year 1. Machine A's servicecontract is $3000 per year but is only available for 2years, effectively giving this machine a 3-year life.Machine B's service contract is $3500 per year and isavailable for 4 years (effectively a 5-year life). Wewill present analysis (using present value and theannuity formula) to help decide which to purchase.This information is also useful in lease vs purchasedecision. 6. Summary It is hoped that this presentation will allow practi-tioners to add a new tool(s) to their toolbox whenconsidering a new or replacement purchase or whenconsidering the addition of new services to a prac-tice. The basic version is a good place to start forthose new to business concepts; while the more ad-vanced version may be more attractive to those ex-perienced with such concepts. The use of break-even analysis in any form is an important consideration when making such important practicedecisions.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 385THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TRANSITIONS FOR PRACTICE GROWTHTransition From Solo Ambulatory to Brick and Mortar Practice: Work Smarter Not Harder Tracy R. Walker, DVM Author's address: Allegheny Equine Veterinary \u00a9 2016 AAEP. 1. Introduction The decision to expand your practice can be excit-ing and overwhelming at the same time. As asolo practitioner you have enjoyed the simplicityof working by yourself, making your own deci-sions, and keeping your overhead at a minimum. This presentation will highlight my personal ex- periences transitioning from ambulatory to brickand mortar practice. I started my practice tenyears ago in a rural area with no prior equine ser-vices. While building my equine practice I alsoworked locum and part time at a small animal hos-pital. In 2015, the small animal hospital closedand I purchased property to expand my ambulatorypractice with a large animal haul-in facility andsmall animal hospital. This presentation will focuson the transition and expansion of the large animalpractice. 2. Is Transition and Expansion Right for You? First, you must decide whether transition or expan-sion of a haul-in hospital will be of benet to youpersonally. Approach the decision in two parts:subjective or emotional considerations, objective ornancial considerations.3. Subjective Evaluation Are you happy and satised with your current work- ing situation? List what makes you happy andthings you would like to change about your currentworking situation. Consider your personal aspectssuch as quality of life, working hours, family, per-sonal time, and income. It is equally important toconsider professional satisfaction. Are you able toattend quality continuing education? Are you ableto purchase new equipment necessary to practice atthe level you wish? And lastly, are you planningappropriately for retirement? Are you prepared forthe increased responsibility of an expansion, man-agement of more employees, and increased debtload? Do you really want to do this? 4. Objective Evaluation How much is this going to cost you? Can you affordto do this? How will you pay for this and will it beworth it in end? Enlist a CPA or MBA to help withthe objective measures. Evaluating the nancialcommitment is enlightening to say the least. Startby creating a budget for land purchase, buildingconstruction, and/or renovation. Practice historicaldata can be used to create reasonable projections.Create a 60-month nancial projection. These pro-jections will take into account growth of income, 386 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TRANSITIONS FOR PRACTICE GROWTH NOTESdebt service, additional employees, and additionalequipment. Seeing the budget and projections canbe sobering. Draft a business plan to dene the goal of the project. The Small Business Administration hasseveral online tools and articles to help draft a plan. 1 The business plan is a working document that willdene a clear goal while providing a guide andtimeline for the project as it progresses. A currentmarket analysis will be part of the business plan.Several resources for companion animal marketanalysis are available. Information for quantita-tive large-animal market analysis can be difcult tond. The American Veterinary Medical Associa-tion (AVMA) Report on Veterinary Practice Busi-ness Measures is published every 2 years and can bepurchased on the AVMA Web site. 2The National Agricultural Statistics Service is a free resource of animal population census that can be broken downby county. 3A market analysis should also include evaluation of competition. Mapping other existing veterinary practice locations, competing practicecoverage areas, and your existing practice coveragearea will help determine an ideal location for yourhaul-in location. Armed with this information, you can objectively evaluate the project. Is the project nancially fea-sible? Can you afford to do this? 5. Now Make it Happen Once you have made a decision to add a building,begin preparations for a loan application. We be-gan by paying off any debt and developing a cashsavings. We re-evaluated our bookkeeping systemto more easily separate and track new incomesources and expenses. 4In addition, the current business structure was re-evaluated and the busi- ness was restructured from a sole proprietorship toa professional limited liability corporation. The ad-vantages and disadvantages of the various businessstructures will vary by state. I consulted both alawyer and accountant to determine whether re-structuring was to my benet. However, in mycase, restructuring was of benet mainly for liabilityreasons. Actively search out property and make inquiries about potential real estate locations. In my area,good property rarely gets listed on the real estatemarket. I encourage you to look at both land andexisting structures. Many existing structures canbe easily converted to a suitable practice locationwith reduced cost compared with new construction.Beware of local ordinances and permitting whensearching for a suitable piece of property. Manycities have restrictions against livestock, barkingdogs, and other laws that may affect the suitabilityof certain locations. I actively searched existinglistings and approached three unlisted properties.Ultimately, the property I chose was an unlistedexisting commercial building with accessibility fortrailers and suitable geographic location.Design of the property can be done by you or you may hire an architect. Given the overall budget ofmy project, I chose to design the property myself.This may or may not be the best decision for you,depending on your experience or availability to over-see the project. Regardless, you should researchdesign ideas. There are several printed and onlinepublications that are helpful to review for designideas. 5,6Using an online design app7will help you create to scale drawings and three-dimensional drawings of your project. My entire project wasdesigned on a simple app with overlays for electric,plumbing, ventilations, and security/informationtechnology as needed. The location was suitable foran equine haul-in facility and a small animalhospital. Does this all seem like \"putting the cart before the horse?\" Completing all of these pre-requisites is ex-hausting and time consuming. However, armedwith a complete business plan, you will condentlyapproach the nancing. In my case, a well-organized business plan resulted in several bankscompeting to nance the project and a quick 30-dayclosing. 6. The Transition Marketing: Feed the Need for Information How you market this transition to clients is essen- tial to their retention. Create a marketing calen- dar that follows the construction/renovationtimeline. It is important to provide appropriate in-formation in a timely manner. Our initial an-nouncements were specic about services but vagueon time. We advertised the opening of our hospitallocation in the Spring and were careful to avoidspecic dates. Overestimating the opening date orconstant delays can deter from the excitement of theproject. Leak Information Start by personally talking to your best clients while on routine farm calls. This builds loyalty as theseclients are assured that you are not abandoningthem and also honored that you let them know rst.We began leaking information about location, plans,and additional services as soon as we closed on theproperty. Formally Announce Compose a letter to your top clients. Include the exciting news, location, and new services that will beoffered and assure clients that farm service willremain available. Create Buzz Make an announcement in your practice newsletter or practice blog. Use social media to your advan-tage. Collect photos from day one of constructionand planning. Within a few months of your movein date, post regularly (twice weekly) with photos AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 387THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TRANSITIONS FOR PRACTICE GROWTHand construction updates, new service updates, andsnippets on design or new hours to be offered. Wecollected construction photos for several weeks be-fore posting them. Then we scheduled postings onsocial media every other day during the 6-8 weeksprior to our move. The repeated postings withdrastic before and after changes created a lot ofresponse on social media.Web SiteUpdate your Web site to include new location infor-mation, new services, and a pictorial tour of theprogress.PostcardsPrint a postcard with a map, hours, and phone num-bers to the new facility. Beginning approximately60 days prior to moving, this was handed directly toclients on farm calls. The postcard was designed tobe placed on a refrigerator and much larger than abusiness card to prevent loss. Clients were relievedto see the written format as if it validated thechanges.Digital Picture FrameApproximately 60 days prior to moving, we placeda digital picture frame with construction photos,PowerPoint slides, and information on the counterat the small animal clinic that was closing. Thissingle tool was very effective in capturing atten-tion of existing clients as they came, generatingquestions, and conversation about the newfacility.Open HousePlan an open house for about a month after you getmoved in. You can begin advertising the openhouse as you get closer to your move-in date. Al-lowing a few weeks between the move-in and openhouse will allow you to nish projects, landscaping,and details. We had our open house and grandopening approximately 6 weeks after our move-indate. An invitation was mailed to our top clients.A press release was provided for the local newspa-per. The primary source for advertising our openhouse/grand opening was via Facebook. Approxi-mately 300 people attended our open house on aweekday afternoon! 7. Addressing Client Concerns It is important to address the specic concerns ofclients as you journey through this process. Mostclients were immediately concerned that we wouldcease farm calls. We were quick to personally as-sure clients that we would continue to offer the sameservices with increased availability via two doctors.This was reinforced in all of our marketing materialand in personal communications. We approachedthese concerns as a great opportunity to educateowners about the new options that this transitionwould bring.Many clients were concerned that the practice would become too large and that our personal com-munication would be affected. Large-animal cli-ents were very comfortable speaking with oneparticular technician who had been with the prac-tice for 10 years. As part of our transition, thistechnician was shifted to a practice manager andlarge-animal coordinator. As we combined the practices, we retained two phone numbers: one for small animal and one forlarge animal. Both phone numbers ring to thesame facility but are directed to their respectivedepartments. This has allowed large-animal cli-ents to bypass the small-animal reception desk andgo directly to the large-animal coordinator. Hear-ing the familiar voice of the large-animal coordina-tor has helped clients accept this growth andchange. 8. How Have We Encouraged Clients to Haul In? Communication and Staff Training It has taken staff, including myself, almost a year to routinely offer haul-in as an option for seeing apatient. Regardless, it is important for staff to offerthis each time they speak with a client. The clientmay not be interested in haul-in for this appoint-ment but it is also a chance to reinforce this as anoption. Availability We have become much stricter about our ambulato-ry/farm call schedule and reducing crazy cross-practice days. Clients are encouraged to haul-in forfaster availability. Reduced Cost Some practices will charge an ofce call in additionto an exam fee for patients hauled to the clinic.We do not charge an ofce call for patients hauled tothe clinic, and this results in a reduced charge tocome to the clinic and acts as an incentive to clients. Increased Quality of Care This is obvious to us as veterinarians, but not to ourclients, who have never had this option. We aresure to explain to clients that we can offer bettercare for certain cases. Service Limitations Some services are only offered in the clinic. Minimal Boarding Cost We have intentionally kept our boarding fee veryreasonable. We have been pleasantly surprised bythe number of clients who have chosen to boardpatients for extended periods for rechecks and ban-dage changes. This reduces our time on the roadfor rechecks and bandage changes. 388 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TRANSITIONS FOR PRACTICE GROWTH9. What I Did Not Expect.... It took me almost 9 months to be comfortable andefcient using the new facility. Old habits are hardto break! I found myself going to the truck to re-trieve supplies because I knew exactly where to ndthem. The addition of new storage space was attimes overwhelming and we re-organized cabinetsand drawers several times. Now that we are set-tled in, the design of the space has worked very well. Establishing trafc flow of equine haul-in patients was a new challenge. Equine clients would tend tobypass the reception desk and walk directly into theequine treatment area. Many of our clients havenever seen an equine hospital and are genuinelycurious about the facility and the cases we see.Satisfying the curiosity of clients and showcasingthe facility had to be balanced with a professionalatmosphere and client/patient privacy in the treat-ment area. We addressed this by adding signage todirect trailer parking and registration prior to un-loading. Receptionists are also instructed to po-litely intervene if a client is seen walking or drivingdirectly to the treatment area doors. In addition,we regularly lead tours through the building to high-light the facility and expanded treatment capabili-ties. I enjoy working up lameness cases again. Inmy practice area, a flat area is hard to nd, let alonea suitable place to trot out a horse. I have quicklybecome spoiled by the paved parking lot for trot out.I also underestimated the luxury of watching alameness from a consistent location and position atthe hospital. The time required for me to dedicate to practice management was sorely underestimated, particu-larly in light of the increased appointment demandby clients. The growth of the practice has resultedin more appointment demand and longer appoint-ment times as I see more complicated cases. Addi-tional staff were hired to maximize doctor time.The ambulatory practice had previously employedtwo veterinarians and two support staff. The cur-rent practice employs two veterinarians and eightsupport staff, including a practice manager whohandles the day to day bookkeeping and employeemanagement. However, the increase in the num-ber of employees requires a clearly dened infra- structure of procedure, policy and maintenanceprotocols that are continually drafted and modiedto maintain our desired level of client service andpatient care. In addition, I have outsourced manytasks such as website management and IT services. 10. The Results The large animal practice revenue has increased by27% since the expansion. Our projections onhaul-in patients were modest at an average of twopatients a week during the rst year. We are well-over our projections, averaging almost one haul-inpatient per day. The small animal practice is thriv-ing and revenues have been important to furtherexpanding staff and equipment. Most importantly,I personally feel inspired to practice again and I'mno longer suffering from burnout. I have time topursue both quality continuing education and per-sonal time. And, I would do it all over again. Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Transitioning into a management role can be asprofessionally and personally satisfying as that of aveterinarian. The flip side of course is that withoutcareful planning and consideration the transitioninto management can be a maze of dead ends andfrustration. The goal of this presentation is to out-line key areas to consider before and during themove to management helping to ensure a smoothtransition. The rst challenge a new manager or leader will nd is that the mindset needed for success in eitheris very different than that of a clinical veterinarian.In the eld, or clinic, we strive to minimize the grayareas of a situation to get to the most accuratediagnosis and treatment plan. Of course, havingblack and white answers is often aspirational ratherthan a reality, but the aim to nd a clear path to ananswer is our optimal goal. Meanwhile, in man-agement we are faced with shades of gray. Duringmy MBA studies we used to joke that the best way toanswer a question is with \"it depends.\" It doestruly depend on the situation. Most of the every-day challenges in management are related to people;staff, clients, co-workers, and suppliers. There isnever a one-size-ts-all solution when dealing withpeople because they all bring their own perspectiveson life in any given situation. The same could be said about dealing with horse owners, but at least ina veterinary situation we have a diagnosis to guideus in treatment and prognosis. One is not harderthan the other, they are just different. Many vet-erinarians that have transitioned into managementpositions have an easier time with the nancial per-formance of their business because dealing withnumbers and spreadsheets are in line with the lab-oratory work and diagnostics we use in veterinarymedicine. If you begin to devote more and more time to managerial duties, then the challenge becomes adapting your mindset to deal with clients when you are seeing patients. Things tend to happenquicker when you are a manager, and you can dic-tate the flow of your day. Managers can block offtime to focus on tasks or schedule meetings at theirconvenience. When animals and clients are in- volved the pace of the day can shift dramatically.When I have to go on the road I have to be veryconscious of not becoming impatient because I amnot in control like I am back in the ofce. Thisimpatience lasts a short time because within a cou-ple of appointments the joy of client relationshipsand the satisfaction of helping horses takes over andI am in the moment. 390 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TRANSITIONS FOR PRACTICE GROWTH NOTESThis vet/business duality is one of the biggest speed bumps veterinarian discover in their new roleof managers. Balancing the needs of the businesswith those of their clients on the same day is ex-tremely challenging. I found myself thinking ofbusiness when dealing with clients and then feelinglike I was not following up on clients when I wasdoing managerial work. Ideally, it is best if man-agement time and vet time can be separated byworking set days on the business, and set days as avet. Keeping the schedule is important for yourcoworkers so that they know to wait to discuss non-urgent business issues, and you are scheduledaccordingly. Compensation for management responsibilities can become a huge issue when there are businesspartners involved. Veterinarians often gauge thevalue they offer to a business by how busy they are,or the amount they bill. This is particularly impor-tant when veterinarians are compensated basedupon production. When the veterinary managerstays in the ofce they lose the ability to earn com-pensation because they are not billing clients. Amanagement fee must be considered for vet manag-ers who work on a commission system. The man-agement fee should be consistent with the marketrate for a veterinary manager for a similar practice.Depending on the size of practice this might be astep down or up in pay; the larger the practice themore a manager would be paid. As an owner youwill see an increase in year-end owner distributionbecause if you are doing your job well the businesswill be growing revenue and prot. There mayneed to be a performance bonus in the compensationplan for an associate if they are taking on manage-rial responsibilities, given that they will not haveaccess to owner distribution. Business is similar to veterinary medicine in that a good education goes a long way. Unlike a veter-inarian, a business manager does not have to belicensed to perform their duties but they shouldconsider some form of education to be able to under-stand their business and communicate with othersin the business world. A good business education isbased upon evidence-based research and offers the student a comprehensive overview of numerous sub-jects. It is not enough to know a lot about one ortwo subjects, rather like veterinary school, the stu-dent should learn about different elements of busi-ness and how they interact and support each other.Just like we learned anatomy and pharmacologybefore we learned equine lameness and surgery, agood business education will integrate various sub-jects into a broader-based program. This does notmean that everyone who wants to manage theirbusiness needs to complete a MBA degree, ratherthey should explore the various options availablethrough professional associations, online courses,community college courses, or more formal businesseducation programs. Once you are established in your role as a man- ager of your practice the nal thing to consider iswhether you are doing a good job. Similar to metrics we use to identify health and sickness in animals, abusiness needs key performance indicators to trackthe health of a business. Some of these metricscould be revenue growth, increased protability,lower staff turnover, or increased employee engage-ment. Whichever metrics are used they should beconsistent with the overall goals of the business andmeasured on a regular basis, which could be quar-terly, semi-annually, or yearly. Managing a veterinary business can be extremely satisfying. Involvement of a veterinarian in man-agement offers an excellent opportunity for someonewho has diagnosed and treated animals to have aninfluence how to offer excellent medical care whileoperating a successful business. Though there willbe challenges in the transition, a methodical ap-proach to change in roles will help ensure success.

Introduction Equine practice owners commonly experience dif-culty nding associates willing to stay long term intheir practices and interested in buying an owner-ship interest when the current practice owner(s)wish to sell shares. This complicates the exit strat-egies of the current owners, given that the bestbuyer is most likely one that is already well estab-lished within the practice. In order to explore the perceptions of equine veterinarians about their work environment, anonline survey was conducted among practitionersto identify the most pressing concerns of practi-tioners with regard to their business and pro-fessional life. A series of questions withinthe survey explored the theme of ownershiptransitions. 2. Materials and Methods An online survey of equine veterinarians was con-ducted in the fall of 2014. The survey researchdesign included the collection of both quantitativeand qualitative data. A link to the survey was posted on the listserv of the American Associationof Equine Practitioners (AAEP) and the EquineClinicians Network. The initial survey was lim-ited to those practitioners whose practice is /H1102275% equine, and was closed after a week of responses.Upon reviewing the raw results, a problem in datacollection was discovered. Due to defects in thefunctioning of the survey, some respondents werenot offered the full complement of survey ques-tions. Consequently, a repaired version of thesurvey that included the missed questions wasposted to both listservs in late November 2014with an explanation and invitation to the affectedrespondent segments. In addition, due to re-quests from listserv members, those providing/H1102175% equine services were invited to participate in the second survey. In order to have valid data,previous (redundant) responses from duplicate In-ternet Protocol addresses were discarded. Re-sponses from both surveys were then compiledadditively. 392 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TRANSITIONS FOR PRACTICE GROWTH NOTES3. Results A total of 516 veterinarians responded to the survey.At the time of the survey, there were 1520 AAEPmembers on the General listserv. It is likely thatthere is signicant overlap with members of EquineClinicians Network, but this is not known with cer-tainty. If considering only the membership of theAAEP General listserv, this is an approximately33% response rate, and would roughly yield a 95%(/H110064%) condence interval. When considering theresults of the survey, it is important to rememberthat the population surveyed was those memberswho are active on the listserv, which, by necessityexcludes the members not utilizing this mode ofcommunication. Important differences may be pres-ent between the non-listserv practitioners andthose surveyed. Survey respondents differed in some demographic characteristics from the AAEP membership re-ported in the 2014 AAEP Annual Report. 1Respon - dents were made up of 38.4% solo practitioners(AAEP 39%); and 6.4% Response). Of the grouppractices, 50.6% respondents worked in practiceswith two to six veterinarians, and 11.0% worked inpractices with seven or more graduated between the years 2004 and 2014,and 55.1% graduated in 2003 or before. Survey responses were obtained from 297 equine veterinarians working in group practices. Of thisgroup, 82.2% practiced in groups with two to sixveterinarians (Small Group) and 17.6% practiced ingroups of seven or more veterinarians (LargeGroup). Associates made up 57.5% of respondents,and partners/shareholders 41.4%, with the remain-der consisting of interns/residents. Associates In the section of the survey exploring perceptionsabout practice ownership, associates were asked ifthey were interested in practice ownership as a part-ner or shareholder. A strong majority (82%) an-swered \"Yes,\" with only 18% indicating no interest.Small Group associates were somewhat more inter-ested in ownership (84%) than Large Group associ- ates (76%) (Fig. 1). Despite a strong interest in practice ownership among associates, they are not generally well in-formed about practice nances. There was a dis-parity in the responses of Small Group practice andLarge Group practice associates regarding the shar-ing of practice nancial data, as demonstrated inFigure 2. It was considerably less likely that asso-ciates at large practices were privy to the practices'nancial data. Similarly, understanding the path to partnership/ ownership was considerably more likely amongSmall Practice associates than those employed atLarge Practices (Fig. 3). Importantly, 31% of SmallPractice associates and 58% of Large Practice asso-ciates did not understand the path to becoming anowner or partner in the practice, and only 14% ofSmall Practice associates and none of the LargePractice associates understood \"very much.\" Associates also displayed little condence that they would be offered partnership or ownership ofshares, as shown in Figure 4. Less than 20% wereeither \"Very condent\" or \"Condent\" in an offer,and there was much less condence among associ-ates employed at Large Practices than at Small. Small Practice- and Large Practice-associates showed little difference in their responses to the Fig. 1. Percentage of associates interested in practice ownership. Fig. 2.

Associates were asked, \"If you are not offered partnership or ownership of shares in the next sev-eral years, what is the likelihood of you staying inyour current position?\" (Fig. 6) areconsidered additively, Large more likely to stay than Small Practiceassociates (34%). In fact, 37% of Small Practiceassociates responded that they were \"Very Unlikely\"or \"Extremely Unlikely\" to stay at their current po-sition if not offered an opportunity for equity. Thiscontrasts with the 17% of large practice associateswho responded in an equivalent way. However,39% of Large Practice associates vs 28% of SmallPractice associates were \"Likely\" to leave their cur-rent position if not offered an opportunity for anownership stake. When adding \"Extremely Un-likely\", \"Very Unlikely\", and of Large Practice associates and 67% of SmallPractice associates indicated they are likely to leavetheir current position if their desire for a stake inthe practice is not met. Practice Owners (Partners/Shareholders) Group practice owners were asked about their desireto sell an ownership interest in their practice to oneor more of their associates. Large Group practiceowner respondents were much more likely to desire tosell shares or take on a partner (93%) than SmallGroup practice owners (59%) (Fig. 7). Although a majority of all respondent group prac- tice owners indicated a wish to sell shares or addpartners, only about half of those who indicated thisdesire had a degree of condence that they would besuccessful in completing the transaction. Althoughno Small Group practice owners were extremely con-dent they will be successful in selling shares to anassociate, 14% of Large Group practice owner re-spondents held this view. An equal percentage ofLarge Group practice owners were pessimistic abouttheir chances for sale of equity (Fig. 8). Owner respondents were given an opportunity to share their reasons for their condence or lack of Fig. 4.

Responses fell into three general categories: 1. Perception that associates/younger genera- tions of veterinarians are not interested inownership 2. Concern that practice ownership is not af- fordable due to student loans held by manyveterinarians 3. Difculty in establishing value of practice that is acceptable to both parties. 4. Discussion Many practice owners have made the sale of theirpractice equity a key component of their retirementplanning. Failure of the ability to harvest theseassets can have serious nancial ramications forthese practitioners' retirement portfolios. Difcul-ties in selling shares in a practice can flow from alack of communication, frequent turnover of associ-ates, or trouble in establishing a practice value thatmotivates both the seller and the buyer to make atransaction. The results of this survey demonstrate a clear lack of communication between associates and owners.The majority of associate respondents are interestedin acquisition of shares; the seriousness of this de-sire is borne out by the high numbers that intend toleave the practice where they are currently em-ployed if they are not given the opportunity to buyinto the business. Meanwhile, many practice own-ers have the perception that associates are not in-terested in ownership. This discordance can bebridged by education and communication. Communication of the path to ownership is essen- tial for associates to understand expectations. Willan invitation to become a partner or shareholderfollow achieving a specic gross revenue gure, dem-onstrating certain work behaviors, being employedfor a certain number of years, or bringing in a cer-tain amount of new business? If an associateachieves those things, but is not well liked person-ally by the practice owner, will this prevent an offerof shares? Will the owner communicate clearly ifownership is not and will never be an option, basedon certain behaviors or personality traits that have been observed in the associate? If partnership isoffered, what is the process? How is the value ofthe practice determined? Will the nancing be in-side or outside the practice? Will a down paymenttypically be required? Associates that do not un-derstand the process of becoming an owner mayseem to have no interest, but they may in fact thinkthat their employers are not interested in sellingsince they have not been engaged in conversationabout it. Bringing an associate into an equity position is ideally a several-year process that includes nancialand business management education. Learninghow to handle difcult personnel or client interac-tions; becoming familiar with branding and market-ing; and understanding the concepts of revenue,expenses, and net prot are rst steps on the path toownership. This type of education is valuable forassociates as well, even if they choose to remainemployees rather than owners for the course of theircareer. Sharing increasing amounts of nancialdata and delegating management tasks are nextsteps. Finally, explaining the mechanics of the val-uation and purchase of shares fairly early in theprogression will allow a thoughtful deliberation.The results of the survey show that this approach israrely followed. If more communication about thepath to ownership occurred, perhaps even more as-sociates would be interested. Finding associates that will remain employed in their practice long term is a common problem forsome practice owners. Because the most readilyaccessible buyer is one that is already well estab-lished with the practice, this complicates the exitstrategies of these practitioners. It is also disrup-tive to clients to have to frequently adjust to a newcare provider; and expensive for a practice to nd,train, and market each new hire. It is not uncommonfor practice owners to feel like they simply cannot ndthe right candidates and to be disappointed in theyoung veterinarians they meet. Although it is a fact of the times we live in that dual-career couples fre-quently must move for a spouse's promotion, successin retaining associates also requires a number ofelements: having a clear mission and vision for thepractice, understanding partner values so one canhire in alignment with them, having a practice culture that is appealing to new hires and in align-ment with their values, understanding generationaland gender differences in younger veterinarians,and being committed to associates' professionaldevelopment. As reported previously, of the 185 solo practitio- ners responding in the 2014 AAEP Listserv survey,75.4% had previously worked in a group practice(excluding internships). Of these, 77.8% were pastassociates and 22.2% had been owners or partners ingroup practice. The survey asked these solo prac-titioners, \"What is the primary reason you are nowin solo practice?\" Dissatisfaction with practice cul- Fig. 8.

Of therespondents previously employed as partners orshareholders in a group practice, 26.7% cited part-ner/shareholder discord as the primary reason theyare now a solo practitioner. 2A practice culture that is in alignment with the veterinarian's values is essential for professional contentment and long-term employment. Understanding values is essential to hiring suc- cessfully. Individuals absorb their values fromtheir earliest experiences in their nuclear families, and these core beliefs will guide them through theirlifetime. These are the personal truths that feelundeniable. Values are the core of identity of indi-viduals and organizations; they are principles, be-liefs, and philosophies that shape what you believeis right. In a veterinary practice, values mirror theowners' nonnegotiable beliefs and give birth to theculture. When practice owners continually demon-strate and communicate those values, they provide aguideline for the expected behaviors of the entireveterinary team. It is essential that practice own-ers hire to support their values, because people withdifferent values feel as strongly about their corebeliefs as others do about theirs. When the valuesof the owners and the employees are not aligned,none will be happy. Organizational culture is dened as the common organizational mindset, and encompasses the phi-losophy, attitudes, feelings, values, and behaviors ofthe group and its members. It is based on sharedattitudes, beliefs, customs, and written and unwrit-ten rules. Throughout the ages, each generationhas struggled to understand the perspective of thegeneration following it. Society changes, and as aresult the values that children absorb from theworld around them change along with it. If a prac-tice's culture is inflexible and leaves no room for newideas and approaches, it should be no surprise thata generation with different life goals will opt out andseek a different home for their career. It is impor-tant to remember that experienced, mature practiceowners and new veterinarians seeking positions asassociates both share many of the same goals: theywant to be successful in their profession, have nan-cial security, make a difference in the lives of horsesand the people who own them, and feel good abouthow they are spending the days of their life. Establishing the value of the practice to buy or sell shares can be fraught with emotion, but in fact it issimply mathematical. Many, if not most, equinepractices are valued by the discounted earnings orcash flow method, which is based on the principlethat the total value of a business is the present valueof its projected future earnings. The net presentvalue for the sum of the projected earnings is deter- mined by using an appropriate discount rate. Theworth of a business is almost entirely made up of itsability to produce cash (prot). A buyer is essen-tially purchasing a future stream of income. Thevalue of tangible assets is mostly in what cash theyhelp produce for the practice, given that the fairmarket value of used equipment is quite low in theveterinary industry. In many negotiations, thepractice owner has an inflated idea of the worth ofthe practice, and this may discourage an associatewho is a potential partner. In most sales of shares,the ownership return should service the debt to pur-chase it, leaving the buyer's income for effort as aveterinarian intact. In other words, the new ownershould be paid for being an owner as well as aveterinarian. The ownership portion should be al-located to servicing debt, whereas the remainingveterinarian portion is used as income. Consulta-tion with appropriate legal and accounting profes-sionals is recommended. Bringing associates wanting to buy shares to- gether with owners wanting to sell shares should bepossible and yield successful partnerships if thesetenets are followed by both parties: Regular and transparent communication of professional goals from the earliest stages ofan associate's career Establishment of an inclusive, positive, flexi- ble, and vibrant practice culture Realistic valuation of a practice's worth that embraces the need for a willing buyer and will-ing seller Continuing to hope for a different outcome while refusing to change what is not working is a recipe forfailure. Hope is not a strategy. As William Wardsaid, \"The pessimist complains about the wind.The optimist expects it to change. The realist ad-justs the sail.\" Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Authors' addresses: University ofCalifornia\u2014Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine (Spriet, Espinosa, Galuppo), andCollege of Biomedical Engineering Positron emission tomography (PET) had neverbeen performed in the horse mostly for technical andlogistical reasons. Recently designed portable PETscanners now make it feasible to image the equinedistal limb. 2. Materials and Methods Six horses were imaged with PET under generalanesthesia, three using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), a soft tissue marker, and three using 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF), a bone marker. Images of both front feet and fetlocks were ob- tained in all horses. Carpal also in 18F-NaF-imaged horses. Computed standing magnetic re- sonance imaging, and scintigraphy were alsoperformed. 3. Results Lesions detected with the18F-FDG scans included lysis of the flexor bone,lesions of flexor tendons and ligament, and abnormal uptake through the lamina of alaminitic subject. The 18F-NaF scans demon - strated focal uptake in ligament attachments andsubchondral bone where lesions were not identi-ed using other imaging modalities. 18F-NaF up - take was also present in some osteophytes andenthesophytes. The radiation exposure was slightlyhigher than with 99mTechnetium scintigraphy but re - mained reasonable. 4. Discussion PET images of the equine distal limb up to thecarpus/tarsus were obtained easily using a porta-ble scanner. 18F-FDG scans provided soft tissue information potentially useful for tendinopathy and laminitis research.18F-NaF scans allowed differentiation between active and inactive osse- ous lesions, and highlighted lesions not detectedusing other imaging modalities.

All buttwo horses had acute onset of clinical signs due totrauma, (n /H110057) anesthetic recovery (n /H110056), ndings swelling (n walk (n /H11005 11), varus deformity (n /H110053), and palpable joint instability (n /H110053). Ultrasonographic lesions were graded as mild (n /H110052), moderate (n /H110054), and severe/ruptured (n (n /H1100510), osteo- /H1100511), and joint instability (n /H11005 5). Carpal arthroscopy and standing removal of anavulsion fragment were performed in one horse each. 4. Discussion Ultrasound documented the extent and severity ofcarpal CL injuries and may be preferable to stressradiography. MCL injuries seem to be more fre-quent than LCL injuries and can result in the de-velopment of carpal varus deformity.

Introduction With the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging(MRI) certain types of injuries are frequently seenaffecting the soft tissue structures in the palmarfetlock region. Following acquisition of an MRIstudy, evaluation of the signal pattern within a softtissue injury present on the MR images can be usedto determine whether the injury can be detectedwith ultrasound. Certain signal patterns, in gen-eral, equate to detectable echolucencies on ultra-sound when imaging tendons and ligaments. Ofthe structures in the palmar fetlock region, the in-tersesamoidean ligament (ISL) and straight sesam-oidean ligament (SSL) present with injuries that canbe identied on ultrasound. However, in certaincases these injuries are diagnosed with MRI due tothe technical difculty of imaging this region withultrasound in conjunction with the complex anat-omy. More specically, this circumstance most fre-quently occurs with injury to the ISL/SSL at thetransition point between the two ligaments. Thisarea can be difcult to image with ultrasound for a number of reasons. The ergot can be an impedi-ment, depending on the size, as can the fetlock con-formation. A greater curvature of the structures onthe palmar aspect of the limb due to the conforma- tion increases the difculty in accurately imagingthis region with ultrasound. Furthermore, the ISLand SSL are deep to the flexor tendons, which in-creases artifacts and in certain cases requires alower frequency when compared with imaging themore supercial structures, especially if clipping ofthe hair is not possible. The use of a lower fre-quency creates lower-resolution images, sometimesdecreasing the conspicuity of subtle lesions. TheISL proximal to the sesamoid bones seems to be lessfrequently affected when compared with the distalISL and the SSL. In general, the proximal ISL isoften not examined routinely for this reason, andconsequently some examiners feel less condentwhen imaging this region and fewer abnormalitiesare detected. At the level of the sesamoid bones theISL bers curve along the axial-palmar 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIMAGING NOTESthe sesamoid bones, which requires a different tech-nique for imaging this region compared with theligament bers that are located on midline. Thenecessary examination technique in conjunctionwith the anatomic characteristics affecting the ISLand SSL require that specic attention be paid tothis region when imaging these structures with ul-trasound. Incorporating anatomic knowledge andultrasound skills as well as an understanding ofpathologic change is necessary to perform a com-plete examination of this region. This paper re-views the anatomy and the technique for thecomplete ultrasound examination of the SSL andISL while presenting the more-frequent types ofpathologic change that can be diagnosed usingultrasound. 2. Basic Anatomy The ISL and the SSL lie deep to the flexor tendonsand are continuous with each other (Fig. 1). TheISL begins proximal to the proximal sesamoidbones, forming the proximal scutum, and continuesas the SSL at the base of the sesamoid bones. TheSSL then inserts distally on the middle scutum atthe proximal palmar aspect of the middle phalanx. 1 The ISL is composed of thick collagen bers thatcover the entire palmar and axial surfaces of in a concave shape to allowthe flexor tendons to glide across the fetlock region. 2 The ISL is thicker on midline as it attaches betweenthe sesamoid bones and then fans out graduallybecoming thinner as it attaches to the more axial-palmar surfaces of the proximal sesamoid bones. 2,3 The begins at of the prox-imal sesamoid bones and continues distal to the baseof the sesamoid bones as the origin of the distalsesamoidean ligaments, including the SSL. 1,2As the SSL continues distal from the sesamoid bones, it becomes a trapezoid shape, with the dorsal marginlying against the palmar/plantar recess of the meta-carpophalangeal/metatarsophalangeal joint. Thepalmar/plantar aspect of the ligament widens as itcontacts with the deep digital-flexor tendon andcomprises the dorsal margin of the digital sheath atthis level. The SSL becomes triangular in shapebetween the oblique sesamoidean ligaments with adorsal ber bundle or sagittal part that can appearseparate at the apex of the triangle. When theseparate dorsal ber bundle or sagittal part insertsmore distally with the oblique sesamoidean liga-ments on the palmar/plantar aspect of the proximalphalanx, the SSL takes on an oval shape until itbecomes more triangular as it merges with the axialligaments of the proximal joint andthe branches of the the middle scutum. The proximal a more heterogenous appearance with evidentconnective tissue that dissipates as it continues dis-tally creating a more homogenous appearance imme- diately proximal to the middle scutum. However, thebrocartilaginous area of the middle scutum createsheterogenicity within the middle scutum on midline at the insertion on the middle phalanx. 3. Equipment The ultrasound examinations were performed witha portable ultrasound machine with a 7-12-MHzlinear probe a. A standoff pad is not typically used. Ultrasound Examination Palmar / Plantar Weight-Bearing Approach The technique will be described from proximal to distal, beginning with the ISL and ending with theSSL as it becomes part of the middle scutum. TheISL proximal to the sesamoid bones lateralmargins. At this level the ISL has a predominatelyhomogenous echo pattern as a result of the uniformconnective tissue distribution within the ligament.In most horses the width of the palmar/plantar as-pect of the ISL will exceed the width of the contactsurface of the ultrasound probe requiring this struc-ture to be imaged from the palmar/plantar medialand lateral aspects of the limb. 4The dorsal aspect of the ligament must be imaged through the suspen- sory ligament branches when using the medial andlateral approaches. At the level of the sesamoidbones the uniform or homogenous echo pattern per-sists. However, the curvature of the bers alongthe axial margins of the sesamoid bones requires aspecic technique relative to the anatomy to createechogenicity in specic aspects of the ligament.The probe position must change multiple times toimage the ISL and create echogenic bers on midlineand then in the medial and lateral aspects of theligament. The axial surface of the proximal sesa-moid bones can have depressions or concavities as aresult of normal anatomic variation 4(Fig. 2 ). How- ever, injury to this region can involve bone loss onthe axial margins of the proximal sesamoid bonesand a distinction must be made between anatomicvariation and pathologic change. Within the dorsaldistal aspect of the ISL at this level there are typi-cally vessels creating multifocal echolucencies.The ISL should be imaged continuously from itsproximal extent distally to the level of the ergot,which is typically at the level of the transition be-tween the ISL and the SSL. At this point in theexamination, the best method for imaging the ISLand SSL junction will depend on the conformation ofthe fetlock and the size of the ergot (Fig. 3). Incertain horses the region is best imaged with theprobe proximal to the ergot. However, in is best imaged distal to the ergot. Com-plete examination of this transition requires begin-ning with an image that contains solely the base ofthe proximal sesamoid bones well above the junctionbetween the ISL and the SSL. In the absence ofmoderate or greater osseous abnormalities, theshape and size of the palmar margins of proxi- PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 401IMAGINGFig. 1.

The white boxeson the transverse MR images outline the anatomy on the ultrasound images that were obtained to demonstrate the normal appearanceof the SSL and ISL. The white lines in the sagittal MR images denote the level of the transverse images that were obtained fromproximal to distal. The white box on the rst sagittal image represents how much of the anatomy may not be imaged with ultrasoundif precaution is not taken to visualize under the ergot. The arrow denotes the sagittal part or dorsal bundle of the SSL. Therelaxation artifact of the SSL can be identied on both sagittal MR images to varying degrees. This artifact can complicateinterpretation of the MR images.402 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIMAGINGmal sesamoid bones should be symmetrical and cen-tered on the image. Once this image is obtainedthe probe should be slowly fanned distally, and asthe sesamoid bones disappear this will denote thejunction between the ISL and the SSL, which will bedetectable based on changes in the shape of theligament as well as the echo pattern. At this levelthe SSL is almost triangular to trapezoid in shape,with a wider palmar aspect when compared with thedorsal aspect. In addition to the characteristicshape, the echo pattern becomes more heteroge-neous at this level as a result of a less uniformdistribution of connective tissue and a greater vari-ation in the ber pattern. In addition, the cruciateligaments will be visible at this level immediatelydorsal to the SSL continuing to the level of the jointor proximal aspect of the proximal phalanx, againdepending on conformation. At this level the SSLbegins to transition from being trapezoid to beingtriangular in shape. Distal to the cruciate liga-ments the dorsal ber bundle or sagittal part of theSSL typically becomes evident and can have a vari-ety of appearances. It is important to recognize this as a normal anatomic feature and not a region ofber disruption or separation. It can remain a sin-gle bundle of bers or split into two bundles thatseparate extending medially and laterally. Thedorsal ber bundle or sagittal part becomes sepa-rated from the SSL at the proximal phalanx andtraverses toward the oblique sesamoidean ligament(OBSL)s as it continues distally and inserts on thepalmar/plantar aspect of the proximal phalanx atthe distal extent of the OBSLs and sometimes seemsto merge with the axial margins of the OBSLs prox-imal to the insertion on the middle phalanx. Prox-imal to the level at which OBSLs are inserting, andtypically distal to the palmar or plantar recessthe SSL from being triangular in shape tobeing oval, typically coinciding with the separationof the dorsal ber bundle or sagittal part. The -brocartilaginous region of the distal SSL, given thatit merges to become a part of the middle scutum, isvariable in size and shape creating a prominentecholucency on midline. Fig. 2. The undulating margin of the sesamoid bones in this case is normal variation. However, this shape can complicate imagingof the ISL as there is more variation in the ber pattern and ligament width with this anatomic feature. Additional angles with theultrasound probe will be necessary to create echogenicity in the ligament given that the echogenicity is less uniform. This should notbe confused with bone loss. However, if the distinction is difcult to make then additional imaging can be helpful such as radiographsand nuclear scintigraphy as well as serial ultrasound examinations to look for progression of any bone loss to distinguish pathologicchange from anatomic variation. Fig. 3. The probe placement necessary for imaging the transition between the ISL and SSL can vary based on the fetlockconformation. The region should be imaged with the probe placed both proximal (A) and distal (D) to the ergot identifying the baseof the proximal sesamoid bones and then fanning (B and C) the probe distally to identify the junction between the ISL and SSL.In most cases, one of the methods, either proximal or distal to the ergot will produce better images and this method should be usedas the primary probe position for evaluation of the palmar soft tissue structures. This region should then be assessed for anyabnormalities. This process should be repeated with the limb in nonweight-bearing position to determine whether this yields anyadditional information. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 403IMAGING4. Nonweight-Bearing Technique Displacement of the Ergot Techniques, including nonweight-bearing and man-ual displacement of the ergot, are helpful and incertain cases necessary to fully assess the ISL andthe SSL. Placing the limb in a nonweight-bearingposition permits displacement of the ergot allowingthe ultrasound probe to be positioned in a mannerthat allows continuous imaging of the ligament.This position may be proximal or distal to the ergot,which is dependent on the conformation of the horse.Each position should be attempted to determinewhich method yields more information. Altherna-tively, both methods may be needed to provide themost complete information. Additional advantagesof placing the limb in a nonweight-bearing positionare a decrease in the curvature of the tendons andligaments allowing a more uniform probe angle toevaluate the region, sometimes decreasing the tech-nical difculty, and in certain cases increasing theconspicuity of lesions. In some cases, the decreasedstress on the ligamentous structures that occur withthe limb in a nonweight-bearing position can in-crease lesion size allowing better visualization. 5. Appearance of the Pathologic Change Evaluation of the size, shape, margins, and echopattern are used to identify injury in tendons andligaments. When attempting to diagnose injury ina particular structure it is helpful to know the ap-pearance of injuries that occur frequently. Thisknowledge aides in the recognition of abnormalitiesin the echo pattern as a result of these injuries.Structures that have a heterogeneous echo patternas a result of the normal anatomy are the mostdifcult to evaluate given that subtle lesions can beoverlooked with ultrasound due to difculty of visu-alization. However, in certain cases sequentialultrasound examinations in conjunction with com-parison with the opposite limb can be helpful indifferentiating normal anatomic variation frompathologic change. This is particularly helpful when evaluating the proximal SSL. The more uniform appearance ofthe ISL and the distal aspect of the SSL makes thedetection of abnormalities easier compared with theproximal SSL where the anatomy is most complex(Figs. 4 and 5). Injury of the proximal ISL can bedetected by recognizing an abnormal echo pattern,size, shape, or margin. Examination of the proxi-mal ISL is technically challenging because it mustbe performed in multiple parts. Understanding theanatomic limitations of the ISL at this level is nec-essary to ensure the entire ligament has been eval-uated using the palmar, medial, and lateralapproaches. The ISL at the level of the proximalsesamoid bones is evaluated in conjunction with theaxial aspect of the proximal sesamoid bone marginsand injury in this region can have an osseous andsoft-tissue component (Fig. 5). Evaluation of theISL at the level of the proximal sesamoid bones istechnically challenging because the ligament bers curve along the margins of the proximal sesamoidbones. The probe position must change along thiscurvature to create echogenicity in the ligament.Similar to the proximal ISL, the ligament has ahomogenous echo pattern at this level. Therefore,decreases in echogenicity suggest ber abnormali-ties. However, extreme care must be taken to en-sure that the decreased echogenicity is real and notthe result of the ultrasound beam angle. The probemust be continually moved along the arc of the pal-mar axial margin of the proximal sesamoid bones tocreate echogenicity incrementally within the ISL. The injury at the junction of the ISL and SSL that is frequently diagnosed with MRI and could be de- Fig. 4. Corresponding ultrasound and MR images of injury tothe proximal aspect of the ISL.

The regions of abnor-malities are typically located medially or laterally,and more often both the medial and lateral aspectsare affected but to differing degrees.6. Conclusions Ultrasound is a useful imaging modality for the diag- nosis of injury to the ISL and SSL. MRI will still berequired to diagnose certain injuries affecting the ISL and SSL. However, with an understanding of the normal anatomy, anatomical variations, and the Fig. 5. Injury to the intersesmoidean ligament with adjacent osseous abnormalities (B) of the proximal sesamoid bones is seen as wellin the corresponding radiographs (A). Abnormalities are seen in the proximal ISL (arrow) at the level of the suspensory ligamentbranches (C) as well as at the level of the sesamoid bones. Fig. 6. Corresponding MRI and ultrasound images from three cases with injury to the proximal extent of the SSL at the transitionwith the ISL compared with normal anatomic reference image at this level. These images demonstrate the typical appearance ofinjury to the SSL at this level with focal circular to oval regions of ber disruption and/or ber abnormalities that can be identiedimmediately distal to the sesamoid bones. Focal hyperechogenic regions are consistent with brosis or mineral that is not denseenough to prevent the ultrasound beam from continuing through the tissues. As demonstrated by these cases, the regions ofabnormalities are typically located medially or laterally within the ligament, and both the medial and lateral aspects can be affected,but often to differing degrees.

Introduction During the last 25 years, young Thoroughbredhorses (/H11349 2 y) have been subjected to increasing radiographic scrutiny of joints critical to perfor-mance and frequently affected by radiographic ab-normalities (RAs). The rst sets of radiographs aretypically taken of weanlings before the Novembersale as either a survey or closer to the sale forinclusion in the radiograph repository. \"Surveysets\" are taken 3-8 months before sales to detectRAs that may either affect marketing decisions ordetect RAs that can be improved with therapy.Another set of radiographs is taken near sale timeand are available at the sale as a resource for buy-ers. A horse sold as weanling, yearling, and 2-yearold in training would likely be radiographed at leastfour times. A benet of this radiographic scrutinyis the ability to detect RAs in large numbers ofhorses in the early stages of development and follow the progress over time. Coincident with early ra-diographic scrutiny of sales horses, has been thedevelopment of digital radiography, which providesmore consistent and detailed images than previ-ously available. In addition, the standard for stifleradiography has evolved from a lateral to medial projection alone 1to three required projections in - cluding caudo-cranial elevated15\u00b0 proximodistal, and caudo 30\u00b0 lateral-craniome- dial oblique projections. The latter two projections allow a more thorough evaluation of the medial fem-oral condyle (MFC). Subchondral lucencies (SCLs) in the horse were rst described as bone cysts or osseouscyst-like lesions. 2,3Cysts are usually described as round with a narrow connection with medial femo- rotibial joint located in the central third MFC AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 407IMAGING NOTESas caudo-cranial projection. re-cent descriptions of MFC RA added flattening andconcave lucencies of the central MFC. 4-6Because MFC RAs are most commonly diagnosed in young horses, the cause has been suggested to be osteo-chondrosis; 7,8however, trauma has also been pro - posed.9Gross pathologic examination of large SCL reveals voids containing fluid, brous strands, and debris.9Initial histologic studies revealed bropla - sia and capillary proliferation as well as broustissue, degenerated bone and cartilage, and disorga-nized areas of granulation tissue and wovenbone. 9,10More of \"true found in the margins, and granulation tissue, discontinuous tra-beculae, and small fragments of necrotic bone thatwere interpreted as microfractures. There was athickened cartilage area supercial to areas ofchondronecrosis that demonstrated folding of thecartilage into the area of granulation tissue. 11Bio- chemical analysis of tissue removed arthroscopicallyfrom MFC bone cysts reveals that inflammatory cy-tokines associated with bone resorption are presentand likely play a role in SCL formation andlameness. 12,13 MFC RAs do not always cause lameness, and fol- low-up of sales horses with MFC RAs provides con-tradictory evidence of an effect on performance.In a small number of Thoroughbred sales horses, noeffect on race records of MFC RA was found; 5how- ever, a larger study of Thoroughbreds in Australiadetected a negative effect on 2- and 3-year-old racerecords with cystic lesions deeper than 6 mm. 4 An issue more important for breeders is the signi-cant negative effect on sale (cysts) and on purchaseprice (cysts and lucencies) of MFC RAs. 5Under - standing the progression of MFC RAs progress mayprovide strategies to better manage the condition orreduce the occurrence. Approximately 5% of yearling sales horses (Thor- oughbred and Quarter Horse) have MFC bonecysts 4,6,14although the prevalence for all young horses is probably higher due to the exclusion of yearlings with lesions from the sale. Our observa-tion is that if MFC flattening and small lucencies onthe axial (in contact with the medial intercondylareminence) and central surface of the MFCs wereincluded for Thoroughbreds, the prevalence wouldbe closer to the 40% reported for yearling QuarterHorses. 6Our goals for this study were 1) to de - scribe the progression of MFC RA in young horses,2) to determine the prevalence of MFC RA in Thor-oughbred horses less than 1 year of age, and 3) todetermine the prevalence of changes in the MFC upto 20 months of age. 2. Materials and Methods The MFC was examined in stifle radiographs inthree groups of horses. All initial radiographs at least theCa-Cr view, and often also the Cl-CmO. Group 1horses were born in 2013 and 2014 and were se-lected to improve understanding of the progressionof MFC RA. These horses were less than or equalto 1 year of age at rst set of radiographs that wereobtained as survey sets for regular clients of thepractice. There was a severe MFC RA in at leastone stifle joint. The MFC RAs were: MFC articu-lar flattening with greater than 10 mm sclerosis,sclerosis with an irregular lucency at the joint sur-face of the central MFC, or a large concave lucencyin the MFC (Fig. 1). MFC flattening alone (withoutsclerosis) was not included. There were at leastthree sets of stifle radiographs taken at 60-day in-tervals. At 120 and 240 days, the appearance ofboth MFCs were summarized as improved, worse, orthe same. Improvement was a return of the distalarticular surface, a loss of sclerosis, or densicationof a lucency. Worsening RA was an increase in thesize of sclerosis or lucency. If there was no changein radiographic appearance, the MFC was graded assame. Group 2 horses were born in 2014 and were less than or equal to 1 year of age at rst set of radio-graphs obtained for clients of the practice (for surveyor for inclusion in the sale) or were repository setsread for prospective buyers of weanlings. Gradesassigned for each MFC were normal, mild flattening,flat, and lucency (includes rounded and irregular).Normal MFC shape was a smooth and continuouslyconvex contour, 6slight flattening was a minor loss of convexity, flat is an obvious flat spot, and a lucent MFC had a loss of bone density at the articularsurface that was either rounded or irregular (Fig. 2). Group 3 horses were a subset of Group 2 that had stifle radiographs taken for the 2015 yearling saleradiograph repository and MFC shape and densitywere graded the same as Group 2. For comparisonover time, a summary grade based on the most se-vere MFC RA (in either stifle) was assigned to Group3 horses at both time periods (weanling and yearlingage) and were judged as the same, improved, orworsened. The best grade was normal, followed byslight flat, flat, and a concavity or lucency at thearticular surface was considered the worst. Horses'sex and the age at imaging were also recorded.Age was analyzed using the Student ttest and cat- egorical differences were analyzed with /H92732-squared analysis. Signicance was a P/H11349.05. 3. Results There were 11 horses in Group 1 that averaged 260 days of age (range, 182-310 d) when the rst set ofstifle radiographs were obtained. There were threemales and eight females. At set 1, four horses hadunilateral MFC RA (three right, one left), and sevenwere bilateral. The summary grade of the worstlesion was: two horses had large rounded lucen-cies, six had lucencies and sclerosis, and three had 408 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIMAGINGflattened central articular surfaces with deep scle-rosis. All RAs on the Ca-Cr projection were widestat the joint margin (8-12 mm). At 120 days afterset 1, four horses showed improvement, ve hadworsened, and two were the same. In nine horsesradiographed at 240 days after the rst set, vehorses were improved, three had worsened, and onewas the same. The four improved horses had sub-stantial healing of lucencies, and three of the fourwere unilaterally affected. The three horses thatworsened had enlargement or development of lucen-cies (two bilateral, one unilateral), and the samehorse had no change in a shallow lucency.There were 638 horses of an average age of 239 days (range, 124-365 d) in Group 2. Therewere 287 females (45%) and 351 males(55%). Summaries for Group 2 MFC grades arelisted in Table 1. Of the 267 horses with an RA,106 (39.7%) were affected bilaterally. Of the 162unilaterally affected horses, 108 (67%) were rightMFCs and 54 (33%) were left MFCs. There was noassociation of horse's sex with MFC RA. Consider-ing all were more abnormalgrades in right MFCs (41.8%) than left (24%). There were 188 horses with an average age of 529 days (range, 455-595 d) in Group 3. There Fig. 1.

Of the 82 horses with an RA, 46 (57.3%)were affected bilaterally. Of 36 unilaterally af-fected horses, 25 were of the right MFC (69%) and 11of the left (31%). There was no association ofhorse's sex with MFC RA in Group 3. Table 2 pro-vides detail about the changes in MFC grade inGroup 3; there was a nonsignicant increase in theprevalence of flattening and a nonsignicant de-crease in the prevalence of lucencies with age.Eighty-ve percent of horses with normal MFC atset 1 had a normal grade at set 2, whereas only 37%of horses with a lucency had a lucency at set 2, and63% healed. Horses that healed the lucency be-tween stifle radiograph sets were younger (mean,219 d) at set 1 than those that retained the lucency(mean, 251 d; P/H11005.03). 4. Discussion Most reports on RA of the MFC focus on the treat-ment of bone cysts causing lameness in horsesgreater than 1 year of age. With the exception of arecent novel technique, 15most treatments either poorly document radiographic healing or report it as uncommon.2,10,16However, in younger horses, ra - diographic healing of osteochondral abnormalities inseveral locations, including the lateral trochlear ridge of the stifle, has been reported up to 8 monthsof age (the MFC was not examined). 17Our experi - ence with juvenile Thoroughbreds was that improve-ment in MFC RAs can occur if they arise before 1year of age and that development of large MFClucencies \"bone cysts\" was uncommon after the year-ling sale (age range, 16-20 mo). This suggests awindow of susceptibility to the development of MFCRA in young Thoroughbred horses. This period isone of dynamic development of the musculoskeletalsystem that includes rapid bone growth, substantialincreases in weight, and increasing exercise. Be-cause MFC RAs arise during skeletal development,osteochondrosis has been considered a potentialcause; 7,8however, since the rst descriptions, me - chanical trauma has also been considered a factor.9 The progression of MFC RAs in this study as indicated in Fig. 3 suggests that in affected horses,the rst RA detected is a large ( /H11022100 mm 2) area of sclerosis in the proximal trabecular bone and flat- tening of the MFC. Most frequently, the affectedarea is the central MFC in contact with the tibialplateau, although it can occur axially. If the RAprogresses, a wide lucency appears at the joint sur-face within the sclerotic area, which gradually en-larges and becomes rounded, (Type 1 subchondralbone cyst [SBC] 10). Concurrently, the area of deep sclerosis becomes smaller, but a dense sclerotic mar- gin forms around the lucency including the jointsurface. Finally, the communication with the jointand the lucency narrows. This narrowing at thejoint is also seen in early healing of horseshoe-shaped lucencies (Type 4) after placement of atranscondylar screw, 15and probably represents an attempt at healing combined with some col- lapse of the articular margin of the lucency (bar-reling). Regression (improvement) or healing ofMFC RA is demonstrated by a reduction in thesize of the deep sclerosis and lucency, and someTable 1.

Substantial healing occurred in somehorses in this study (Fig. 4); however, a return tonormal did not occur. Bone remodeling is driven by the local mechan- ics. 18,19Frequency and amplitude of external load are contributing factors, but loading rate seems to be the primary stimulation for osteo-cytes 20that act as strain gauges within mineral -ized tissue.21Osteocytes recruit osteoblasts,21 which increase intramembranous bone formation on existing trabeculae, resulting in thickenedtrabeculae and radiographic sclerosis. However,when loading parameters exceed the failurethreshold (occurring at very small strains intrabecular bone 22) microcracks form.23Diffuse microcracks are produced during constituent ac- tivities24,25and are managed by a balance of the Fig. 3.

These focal areas of resorp-tion have a local strain-enhancing effect 27that could reinforce the activation of osteoclasts, bone removal, and void enlargement. We hypothesizewhen overload is persistent, remodeling becomesmaladaptive, the void reaches a critical size, andthe articular cartilage collapses. Cartilage col-lapse exposes bone to synovial fluid. Bone hasbeen shown to be a primary source and reservoirfor inflammatory mediators in osteoarthritis, 28,29 and is also probably a factor in the formation oflarge lucencies in the MFC. tissue has been and tissuemedia from the cyst lining increases osteoclastactivity. 12,13Inflammation contributes to further bone removal. Eventually, a pathologic steady state is achieved in the MFC and there is little netchange in the size of the lucency. However, jointinflammation persists, and in concert with theroughened cartilage surface, can cause furthercartilage and meniscal deterioration. 30 We believe that extensive focal damage to MFC trabecular bone, the subsequent cartilage col-lapse, and local osteosynovial inflammation is suf-cient for the formation of MFC RAs in younghorses. It also explains the relatively smallamount of articular cartilage damage (as com-pared with bone) in young horses with large lu-cencies. However, little is known about thetiming of the disappearance of growth cartilageof the articular surface of the MFC and the forma-tion of the subchondral plate, so it is not possibleto rule out a contribution from injury to growthcartilage (osteochondrosis) as a cause for MFC RAas has been postulated. 11 The prevalence of MFC RA in this study is similar to the 40% (yearlings) or 44% (2 year olds) reportedfor Quarter Horses. 6Comparison of Groups 2 and 3 suggest that healing of lucencies is possible in some horses, but that development of new lucen- cies can also occur. Horses that were youngerwhen a lucency was discovered were more likely toheal, suggesting that early diagnosis might allowimplementation of strategies such as restriction ofexercise to promote healing. However, we haveno information on the exercise allowed subjecthorses. Besides youth, it was not possible to de-termine other factors that contributed to healing.Studies are ongoing investigating whether exer-cise restriction will promote MFC RA healing.The right-sided predilection for MFC RA was rstdescribed by our group 5and similar results have been reported subsequently.6,15,30The reasons for the asymmetry are unknown, but given thatthis study reports a right-sided predilection forMFC RAs in untrained horses, trained activity isunlikely to be the cause.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors have adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

The ability to detect subchondral injuries of the fetlock joint using eld radiography would be anessential tool for equine ambulatory practitioners.In racehorses, the primary area of interest for sub-chondral injury of distal MC III or MT III is thepalmar or plantar aspect of the condyle and specialradiographic projections were developed for evalua- tion of this region. 1,2,4,9 To assist practitioners in achieving the diagnosis of subchondral bone injury of the fetlock joint insport horses, the objectives of this paper are 1) toreview the relevant anatomy and standard radio-graphic projections of the fetlock, 2) to introducenonstandard radiographic projections that should beincluded in routine evaluation of fetlock joint-re-lated lameness in the sport horse, and 3) to presenta case series of sport horses diagnosed with injuriesof the subchondral bone of the fetlock joint usingeld radiography. 2. Materials and Methods Clinical Cases Twelve horses cared for by Miller & Associates, Brewster, NY, were identied by retrospective re-view of medical records as being diagnosed withsubchondral bone injury of the fetlock joint usingeld radiography over a 7-year period (2009-2016).The medical records were reviewed and informationregarding signalment, clinical examination, diag-nostic imaging (radiography, ultrasound, nuclearscintigraphy, 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIMAGING NOTESwas gathered. All horses had standard and non-standard radiographic projections. Seven horseshad other diagnostic imaging studies in addition toradiography. Preparation Although no special preparation is necessary to ac-quire radiographic views necessary for identicationof subchondral bone defects, routine preparation ofthe horse for radiography includes removing anydirt or gross debris from the skin surface in thefetlock region. Depending on patient complianceand pain level, sedation may be required to acquireoptimal radiographs. For all radiographs of the dis-tal limb, particularly when the evaluation of jointspace is anticipated, the horse should be standingsquarely, with equal weight on the medial and lat-eral aspects of the limb. Generator settings andlm focal distance are equipment dependent andmanufacturer or user protocols should be used.External radiographic markers are stronglyrecommended to annotate the lateral (or dorsal)aspect of the limb. Many digital radiographicmarkers are not accurate when acquiring nonstan-dard projections. Prior to beginning the radiographic examination, it is important to consider the anatomy of the fetlockjoint and the common sites of fetlock joint-relatedpathology. For example, dorsopalmar, dorsoplan-tar, and oblique projections taken a flat beamangle will superimpose the proximal sesamoid bonesover not only the III or MT III condyle but alsoover the articular surface, both of which are commonsites of pathology. In addition, because of the curv- ing nature of the distal MC III or MT III condyle, asteeper dorsopalmar or of the distal condyleor articular margin than will a flatter beam angle(Fig. 1). In all cases of fetlock joint-related lame-ness in sport horses, we recommend obtaining boththe standard and nonstandard radiographic viewsdescribed below. However, differential diagnosesin a particular case may warrant obtaining addi-tional views. Standard Radiographic Views of the Fetlock Joint Although the number of views and radiographicbeam angle projections included in a standard fet-lock study may vary depending on region and prac-tice, in general ve views are taken as standardradiographic projections of the fetlock joint in sporthorse practice. ob- tained parallel to the sagittal plane of the limb, and Fig. 1.

Weight-Bearing LM and Fl-LM Views Standing and Fl-LM views are obtained perpen-dicular to the sagittal plane of the limb. In somehorses, the cofn and fetlock joints have differingsagittal planes due to variation in conformation, andso positioning for lateromedial views of one may notbe appropriate for the other. In addition, the per-son holding the limb in flexed position for the Fl-LMview must take care to hold the limb perpendicularto the radiographic detector and generator. A cor-rectly obtained lateromedial view should completelyalign the medial and lateral condyle of MC III or MTIII.

The from dorsal to lateral (or medial) bones and MC III or MT IIIcondyles. Therefore, in a DLPMO view, for exam-ple, this separation means the lateral sesamoid andlateral MC condyle can be viewed with minimalsuperimposition (Fig. However, these viewsmay obscure dorsal proximal P1 fragments whensuch fragments occur in an axial location. Nonstandard Radiographic Views of the Fetlock Joint The following views and techniques are uncom-monly obtained in radiographic studies of the fetlockjoint in sport horse practice. When made consis-tently, these nonstandard views allow for evaluationof specic regions of the curving bonesurface that are often implicated in the sport horse. Furthermore,contrast arthrography augments the routine pro-jections and allows cartilagesurface.Additional Dorsal Proximal to Palmaro- (Plantaro-) Distal Views Due to the curving nature of the MC III or MT III condyle, varying the proximal to distal beam anglechanges the region of the joint through which thebeam is tangential (Fig. 1). Steep (45-60\u00b0 proxi-mal to distal) beam angle is tangential to the dorsalportions of the fetlock joint. A flat beam angle istangential to the most distal portion of the condylenear the transverse ridge. Given that the exactlesion location (subchondral bone lesion or other) isusually not known in advance of obtaining radio-graphs, multiple dorsopalmar or dorsoplantar viewsshould be obtained with example, Pr-PaDiO View The dorsoproximal to dorsodistal (DPr-DDi) view, orskyline view, aids in the diagnosis of subchondrallesions of distal MC III. This view is obtained byholding the limb in a forward and flexed position,with the plate underneath the flexed fetlock and theradiographic beam oriented in a nearly vertical di-rection (Fig. 3). The view is difcult to perform inthe hindlimb because the abdomen of the horse canbe in the way and the horse often resents having the Fig. 2. Normal DLPMO radiograph.

Contrast Arthrography Positive contrast arthrography aids in the indirectevaluation of the cartilage within the fetlock joint.Contrast arthrography is not essential to the diag-nosis of subchondral bone lesions of the fetlock joint;however, it can provide additional valuable informa-tion about communication between the subchondralbone lesion and the fetlock joint, which in turn candirect the treatment plan and prognosis.

A total volume of 12-15 mL should be injected.After injection, flexion and extension of the jointshould be performed, to allow for even distributionof the contrast media. Radiographic projectionsshould be obtained immediately and then again af-ter 1-2 minutes. The dorsopalmar or dorsoplantarprojection at varying proximal-to-distal beam anglesand the skyline projection are useful for furthercharacterization of subchondral bone lesions of thefetlock joint (Fig. 4). 3. Results The retrospective review of the medical records atMiller & Associates identied 12 horses diagnosedwith subchondral bone injury of the fetlock jointfrom January 2009 to February 2016. Of the 12horses that were identied, nine horses had sub-chondral bone injuries to a forelimb fetlock joint,whereas three horses had subchondral bone injuriesto The distribution medial MC III (four cases), distallateral MC III (one case), the sagittal groove of prox-imal P1 in a forelimb (three cases), proximal medialP1 in a forelimb (one case), and the sagittal groove ofproximal P1 in a hindlimb (three cases). No lesionsof distal MT III were identied. All horses in this study were used for jumping, with ve show jumpers, four show hunters, andthree hunter seat equitation horses.

Multiplesigns were present in all eight cases that had clinicalsigns relating to the fetlock joint. Of the six horsesthat had intra-articular fetlock per-formed, all lameness localized to the fetlock regionwith a low block blocked. In all 12 cases, the subchondral bone lesion was identiable on radiographic views. In three of 12cases, the subchondral lesions were only visible onnonstandard radiographic projections. In an addi-tional ve cases, the standard projections.In four cases, the subchondral bone lesion was read-ily evident on standard views. The diagnosis wasmade initially with radiographs in all but two cases(nuclear scintigraphy was used for the initial diag-nosis in one case, and nuclear scinitigraphy andMRI in the other case). Lesions of distal medial MC III and distal lateral identied using the DPr-DDi sky-line radiographic view (Fig. 5).

In all of the scintigraphic, magnetic reso-nance (MR), and CT imaging, the subchondral bonelesions were readily evident. Cross-sectional imag-ing (MR and CT) provided a detailed evaluation ofthe articular surfaces, allowing for earlier detectionof lesions (as seen in one horse) and more completeassessment of the joint. Nuclear scintigraphymaps areas of active bone turnover providing ameans of assigning signicance to clinical and radio-graphic ndings. Sonographic evaluation of thefetlock joint region was employed to rule out soft-tissue injuries to the fetlock joint region in somecases. Records from 11 of the 12 cases contained suf- cient follow-up information to present treatmentsand outcomes. The twelfth case is only 1.5 monthsout from diagnosis at the time of submission of thispaper. All horses were rested for a duration rang-ing from 1 to 8 months, with a mean rest period of4.5 months and median rest period of 4 months.Intra-articular therapy with hyaluronate sodium b Fig. 5.

An additional horse was lame but still in active rehabilitation. 4. Discussion Standard and nonstandard radiographic projectionsof the fetlock joint provide a safe, readily availablediagnostic test for the identication of subchondralbone injury of that joint. The incidence of subchon-dral bone injury in sport horses has been reported asrare, with Dyson and Murray 5describing 12 cases of 2500 over a 5-year period. However, clinical obser- vation would suggest that this injury is a problem ofincreasing importance. Historically, the diagnosishas relied upon advanced imaging techniques, 5-8 and the ability to recognize the problem with routinediagnostics may show subchondral bone injury to bean underdiagnosed problem. The radiographic diagnosis of the fetlock subchon- dral bone injury is dependent on the acquisition ofan adequate number of appropriately positioned ra-diographic projections. This ability is further ame-liorated by knowledge of the anticipated pathology.In previous studies touting the importance of ad-vanced imaging techniques to diagnose subchondralbone lesions of the fetlock joint, neither the variableproximal to distal beam angle DP views, nor theskyline view were routinely obtained, but in thecases described herein they were the most usefulviews. 5,6,8The majority (three of ve cases) of dis - tal MC III lesions were dorsally located and betteridentied on the down-angle DP view vs a standardDP view. In addition, all of the distal MC III le-sions were best identied and characterized on theskyline DPr-DDi views. The literature states thatboth racehorses and sport horses are predisposed tosubchondral bone injury of the sagittal groove ofproximal P1, 6and six of seven cases of proximal P1 injury in this study were in the mid-to-dorsal por- tion of the sagittal groove, consistent with the liter-ature. These lesions were best seen on the variableproximal to distal beam angle DP views (D30\u00b0-D45\u00b0Pr-PaDiO). In the cases described herein, forelimb lesions were more common than hindlimb lesions. Nohindlimb lesions of distal MT III were recognized inthis study. Because the skyline radiograph is dif-cult to acquire properly in the hindlimb, it is pos-sible that these lesions are not easily identiable.It is also possible that the greater repetitive concus-sion experienced in the forelimbs vs the hindlimbs injumping horses may increase the incidence of sub-chondral bone injuries to distal MC III. In con-trast, lesions of proximal P1 were between distal III weremore prevalent than lesions of the lateral condyle,which is consistent with previous reports in sporthorses and racehorses. 4,5 In the 11 cases with sufcient follow-up informa- tion to analyze, the overall outcome was good, withseven horses returning to their previous level of Fig. 7.

This nding is comparable to otherstudies in sport horses where 75% of horses re-turned to their previous level of exercise. 5How - ever, it is important to note that a lengthy restperiod was required in some cases prior to a success-ful return to exercise. Too few cases and too nu-merous and varied treatment regimes in this studyprecluded in-depth analysis of the relative merits ofdifferent approaches to treatment, but that would beanother interesting area of further inquiry. In conclusion, we present a new radiographic method for evaluating the fetlock joint of sporthorses that allows for the diagnosis of subchondralbone injuries in the eld. We strongly encourageequine ambulatory practitioners to obtain both stan-dard and nonstandard radiographic views of the fet-lock joint as part of the diagnostic process for fetlockjoint-related lameness.

Materials and Methods Navicular skyline radiographs (n /H1100536 limbs) at standard and alternate angles were assessed by veobservers at four experience levels (n /H1100520) for the presence and severity of flexor cortical lysis. Inaddition, observers reported their condence inthese assessments. Responses were comparedbased on reviewing a standard skyline or multipleprojections.3. Results The identication of lysis and the assessment of its severity was most similar to that of radiologistswhen observers of all experience levels were able toview multiple skyline views. On average, observ-ers of all levels of experience became more condentviewing multiple projections. Radiologists morefrequently graded severity and their respective con-dence in accordance with magnetic resonance im-aging when multiple views were available. 4. Discussion When using multiple views, radiology residents, stu-dents and clinicians with experience detected lysisand assessed its severity most similarly to radiolo-gists, in contrast to using only a standard view.Skyline radiographs using a flatter angle of inci-dence allow the beam to be tangential to the moredistal portion of the navicular bone, ultimately im-proving detection of lesions in this location.

Authors' address-es: Gail Holmes Equine Orthopaedic Research Center, Colorado State University, Fort Collins,CO Introduction Proximal metacarpal pain is a common cause oflameness in cutting horses. Radiographic and ul-trasonographic examinations to diagnose lesions responsible for clinical lameness can provide ambig-uous results. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)provides the most comprehensive diagnostic imag-ing evaluation of lesions specic to this discipline. 2. Materials and Methods Retrospective evaluation of Quarter Horses compet-ing or training for cutting events referred for MRI ofthe proximal metacarpus between 2009 and 2012 witha 2-year follow-up period. A single board-certiedveterinary radiologist graded severity of bone and softtissue lesions on a scale from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). 3. Results Thirty-two horses were evaluated consisting of 20right and 24 left forelimbs. The most common nd-ings were third metacarpal ber irregularity (31/44). Twenty-two of 30 horses successfully returned to competi-tion with a mean convalescent period of 157 /H1100638.2 days. Strong correlation exists between suspen-sory ligament enlargement, dorsal margin ber ir-regularity, and the presence osseous resorptionand sclerosis of the palmar cortex of MCIII. 4.

Introduction Digital cushion (DC) has a more complicatedstructure contributing to its role in protecting in-ternal structures than previously thought. How-ever, the histological and functional propertiesof different regions of the equine DC have not beenfully studied. Our objective was to examine theregional distribution of connective, nervous, andadipose tissues, and vascular components ofthe DC in clinically sound hooves of QuarterHorses. 2. Materials and Methods The DC samples from the axial-proximal, axial-distal, abaxial-lateral, and abaxial-medial regions of24 and stained with H&E, trichrome, andelastic stains. On each slide, a 3 /H110033-mm area was assessed by light microscopy. Statistical differ-ences investigated using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney and P/H11021.008 considered signicant.3. Results The axial-distal region was characterized by the presence of signicantly higher collagen ( P/H11021.0001) and and abaxial regions. Almost four times asmany nerve bundles were present in the axial-proximal region as compared to the axial-distalregion. 4. Discussion The regional structural differences of the DC arepresumably associated with different functionalproperties of those regions. Inability of the DC toprotect sensitive internal structures, such as thenavicular bone and related structures, when exces-sive/repeated forces are applied, may initiate path-ological changes.

Introduction Respiratory disease in foals is one of the majorcauses for morbidity and mortality in the younghorse. Early detection and treatment of respira-tory problems is essential for not only the animal'swellbeing, but also for future athleticism in perfor-mance animals. Disorders of the respiratory sys-tem are second in importance only to those of themusculoskeletal system in limiting the athletic per-formance of the horse. 2. Materials and Methods Diagnostic approach to respiratory disorders includethe following: History /H18546Are other foals affected? If so, how many? /H18546Obtain information if there is high morbidity or mortality /H18546Viral infections tend to have a higher mor- bidity compared with bacterial infections /H18546Has the foal been treated for pneumonia before and afebrile? /H18546If yes, then there may be residual inflam- mation that may require bronchodilatorsand corticosteroids either ventila- tion. Foals that have recovered from pneu-monia may still have a persistent cough due toexposure to allergens in the environment. Physical examination /H18546Auscultation of the chest /H18546Percussion of the chest /H18546Endoscopy\u2014Endoscopic examination al- lows direct visualization of the Breed Knowing the age of the foal will provide insight as to the problem. Congential problems are usually noted at birth whereas acquired diseases such asbacterial pneumonia tend to occur in older foals ( /H110222 wk of age). The breed of the animal is important in determin- ing the cause of the respiratory disorder. For ex- 434 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENT NOTESample, Arabian horses with chronic lung infectionsshould be evaluated for combined immunodeciencysyndrome. Selective immunoglobulin M (IgM) de-ciency tends to occur more frequently in Arabiansand Quarter horses, whereas agammaglobulinemiahas been documented in Thoroughbreds andStandardbreds. Auscultation of Chest Auscultation of the chest includes the use of either arebreathing bag or covering the nares to cause hy-perpnea. Bronchovesicular sounds in the younganimal can be easily heard because of the decreasedmuscle mass and less attenuation of the lungsounds. Increased airflow will also increase thebronchovesicular especially in febrile, ex-cited, or hyperpneic animals. Auscultatory nd-ings do not always with the degree ofalveolar ventilation. Foals with lung consolidationmay still have normal bronchovesicular sounds be-cause of the radiation of airflow from the adjacentareas. Therefore, auscultation alone cannot beused to diagnose pathologic condition of the lowerairway. Crackles may be auscultated and represent the equalization of pressure between two compartments(alveoli and the bronchioles) after the airways haveopened (mucus in the airway that does not allow airto flow into the alveoli, but when a deep breath istaken, the air movement flows past the mucus andinto the alveoli). Wheezes are musical sounds thatarise from vibrations within the airway walls byturbulent airflow noted during constriction of theairways. or 7.5 MHz linear trans-rectal transducer (Figs. 1 and 2). The 7.5 MHzdisplays a depth of 4-12 cm, which is ideal for tho-racic examination of a foal. Isopropyl alcohol iscopiously applied to the hair coat to provide surface contact between the transducer and the foal. Thealcohol helps reduce the intervening trapped air.The thorax should be thoroughly scanned in a dorsalto ventral plane from the 16th to the 3rd intercostalspace. Sound waves are completely reflected at the normal aerated lung interface allowing only thepleural surface to be evaluated. The normal vis-ceral pleural edge of the lung appears as a straighthyperechoic line with characteristic equidistant re-verberation air artifacts indicating normal aerationof the pulmonary periphery. The pleural edge of the lung is imaged gliding dorsally and ventrallywhen watching the patient breath during thoracicultrasonography. Only when fluid or cellular accu-mulation in the lung occurs immediately beneaththe visceral pleural surface will an acoustic windowbe created, allowing visualization of pulmonary pa-thology. The affected area of the lung is hypoechoicand/or lacks the normal air echo at the surface.It is critical to examine the lung carefully duringexhalation and inhalation because lesions can movebeneath an adjacent rib or inhaled air into the alve-oli and surrounding airways will cause reflection ofthe sound waves, thereby preventing the visualiza-tion of pulmonary disease. Pulmonary abscesses are variable in size and are located anywhere in the lung. Abscesses areidentied ultrasonographically in the lung bytheir cavitated appearance and the absence of anynormal pulmonary structures detected within theabscess. The center may appear hypoechoic,isoechoic, or septate, depending upon the type offluid present. Pulmonary consolidation is hypoechoic and/or lacks the normal air echo at the surface. Ultra-sonographic visualization of consolidated lung oc-curs because of the replacement of alveolar air withfluid or cells producing an acoustic window. Fig. 1.

Radiography is considered by some to be the princi-pal imaging technique for the evaluation of the tho-rax. However, radiographic examination has itslimits (in the eld and patient size); therefore, ul-trasonography will be a valuable alternative. In-terpretation of radiographs of the lungs and thoraxof the horse require fundamental knowledge of theanatomy of the equine lung. In normal lungs, clearmargins of the aorta and structures at the base ofthe heart including the termination of the tracheaand the origin of major bronchi should be seen in thedorsal cranial projection. The pulmonary arteriesto the right and left dorsal caudal lung segments areseen as they emerge from the base of the heart,ventral and slightly caudal to the tracheal bifurca-tion. In the ventral caudal projection, smallerbranches are seen originating from the pulmonaryarteries at the caudal margin of the heart and en-tering the darker background of pulmonary paren-chyma or as summation over the vena cava and the caudalpart of the cardiac margin. Bacterial pneumoniamay begin as a diffuse interstitial disease and, de-pending on the organism, develop pulmonary ab-scesses as occurs with Rhodococcus sp. There are diffuse nodular opacities throughout the lung withRhodococcus equi pneumonia (Fig. 3). Opacica- tion and loss of detail are greatest around the hilus,which may be evidence of lymphadenopathy. Transtracheal Wash A transtracheal wash (TTW) is a technique used tocollect fluid from the lower respiratory tract for bac-terial culture and cytologic evaluation. The results of the wash can help determine a proper manage-ment of equine respiratory tract disease. Two tech-niques to obtain a TTW include percutaneous andguarded endoscopic sampling. Common Causes of Respiratory Disease in Older Foals Bacterial Pneumonia Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in foals. The etiology of foal pneumoniais complex because of the large number of factorsthat foals are exposed to which can set the animal upfor a bacterial pneumonia. The majority of olderfoals develop bacterial pneumonia following a viralinfection (EHV4). Viral agents damage epithelialcells in the respiratory tree resulting in desquama-tion and focal erosion of the respiratory epithelium,interruption of the protective mucociliary blanket,and impairment of clearance mechanisms. Para-sites can also predispose to bacterial pneumonia bycausing immunosuppression secondary to unthrifti-ness or direct inflammation due to pulmonary mi-gration of ascarids. Clinical Signs Clinical signs vary considerably with some foals having high respiratory rates, whereas others mayhave an occasional cough. Coughing, whether in-termittent or paroxysmal, is an important early in-dicator for respiratory disease. Respiratory ratesgreater than 30 breaths per minute warrant furtherdiagnostic evaluation, which should include auscul-tation of the chest to assess whether inspiratory or Fig. 2. Pulmonary abscess in a foal diagnosed Rhodococcus equi. are noted. Most se-verely affected foals will have flared nostrils and anabdominal component to breathing with minimalthoracic excursion. Bilateral discharge from pro-fuse to scant and fevers are common ndings infoals. Diagnosis Auscultation of the chest with and without a re-breathing bag is needed for assessment of broncho-vesicular sounds relating to alveolar ventilation.Adventitious lung sounds are considered abnormaland are described as either crackles or wheezes. Percussion of the thorax consists of tapping the intercostal spaces of the thorax using a large spoonand a neurological hammer while evaluating thesound produced. Aerated tissues produce a reso-nant sound whereas consolidated lung, lung ab-scesses, and bowel will produce a dull sound. Oncethe entire lung eld has been percussed, it is com-pared with that of a normal foal's lung eld. Ultrasonography and radiography can help iden- tify characterize pathologic Cultureand cytological evaluation via a TTW can be per-formed to help determine the etiological bacteriainvolved.Treatment The selection of an antimicrobial regimen is basedon the following 2: Identifying the causative /H18546Uncommon: Fungal. Foals with diar- rhea are more at risk Determining the susceptibility patterns Host factors Tissue distribution of the drug Foals with pneumonia secondary to severe septice- mia require broad-spectrum therapy. Older foalswith uncomplicated pneumonia can be initiallytreated with a Gram-positive regime with the un-derstanding that if a poor response is noted then theinstitution of broad-spectrum therapy will benecessary. Anti-inflammatory medications are commonly used in foal pneumonia to help control fever andpotentially reduce inflammation of the lower respi-ratory tract. Foal pneumonia can also benet fromtreatment with bronchodilators (see Juvenile Hy-peractive Airway Disease section). It is very impor-tant to keep dust levels to a minimum in the foal'senvironment. This includes soaking all hay givento the mare and foal for 14 days and removing thefoal from the stall when it is being cleaned. Pleural drainage may be warranted when the re- moval of exudate and debris from the pleural spaceallows for the re-expansion of the lung. Decisionsregarding pleural drainage are based on classica-tion of the pleural fluid as a complicated or uncom-plicated effusion. Uncomplicated effusions arethose that do not have sufcient volume to causerespiratory distress and are classied as a transu-date, which contain less than 10,000 nucleated cellsper microliter and less than 2.5 g/dL of the primary cellsseen and mononuclear cells (macrophages, lympho-cytes) are the second most common cell type. Com-plicated effusions are characterized as having asufcient volume to cause respiratory distress, in-creased numbers of degenerative neutrophils, putridodor, cytologically visible bacteria, or cul-ture results. effusions requirepleural drainage. Rhodococcus equi (R. equi) is a well-known worldwide problem. Other less common clinical manifestations of R. equi infections in foals septic arthritis. 3Inhalation Fig. 3. Diffuse opacities (arrows) in the lung parenchyma SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTof contaminated dust particles is thought to be animportant route for pneumonic infection of foals.Ingestion of the organisms is a signicant route ofexposure and immunization, but may not lead tohematogenous pneumonia unless the foal has mul-tiple exposures to very large number of bacteria.Epidemiologic evidence suggests that foals that de-velop R. equi pneumonia are most commonly in- fected during the rst few days of life, but clinicalsigns do not develop until foals are 30-60 days ofage or older. 4 Pathogenesis is a facultative intracellular pathogen and its infectivity is limited to cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. The virulence mechanisms ofR. equi are associated with the virulence plasmid. These 80-90-kb plasmids encoding a family of VapA and VapC to VapH, are responsible forthe ability of R. equi to persist in, and eventually destroy alveolar macrophages. Plasmid-cured de-rivatives of virulent R. equi strains lose their ability to replicate and survive in macrophages and fail toinduce pneumonia in foals, conrming the impor-tance of these plasmids for the virulence of R. equi. 5 Foal pneumonia caused by R. equi is endemic on some farms, intermittent on others, and absent onmost farms. Anecdotally, some mares have report-edly had multiple affected foals, whereas foals ofother mares from the same environment are consis-tently unaffected. The source of infection for foalsremains unknown. Results of a previous study sug-gest that the feces of mares is a potential source of R. equi for the environment and possibly a direct source of infection for foals. 6A study looking at 171 mares in central Kentucky looked at the association between R. equi pneumonia status of the foal and shedding of virulent R. equi by its dam.6Shedding of virulent R. equi was observed in at least one sampling period for every mare examined, and/H1102233% were culture positive during all sampling pe- riods. However, signicant differences were notobserved in either the fecal concentrations of total orvirulent R. equi from dams of affected foals com- pared with dams of unaffected foals. The studyconcluded that dams of affected foals do not shedmore R. equi in feces than do dams of unaffected foals, suggesting that heavier shedding by particu-lar mares does not explain infection in their foals.However, the nding that virulent R. equi in the feces of all sampled mares during at least one sam-pling period suggests that mares are likely an im-portant source of R. equi for their surrounding environment. The association between the exposure to airborne virulent R. equi and the incidence of R. equi pneu- monia among individual foals was recently as-sessed. 4In that study it was noted that airborne concentrations of virulent R. equi were signicantly higher in stalls than in paddocks and virulent R.equi were more frequently isolated from air samples obtained from stalls than from paddocks. Amongthe foals that later developed R. equi pneumonia, it was more likely that virulent airborne R. equi was present in the stalls at approximately 1 week of agethan for foals that remained free of this disease.These ndings suggest that environments contain-ing airborne virulent R. equi during the rst week of life may influence the risk of subsequent disease ofthe foal. 4 Diagnosis The insidious course of infection makes early diag-nosis difcult. Recognition of foals with R. equi pneumonia prior to the development of clinical signswould likely reduce losses and limit costs associatedwith long-term treatment of affected foals. Manydiagnostic tests including complete blood cell count,brinogen level, thoracic ultrasound, radiographs,and serology have all been used to help distinguishR. equi pneumonia from that caused by other patho- gens. However, bacteriologic culture or PCR am-plication combined with cytological examination ofa TTW are still the gold standards used to arrive ata denitive diagnosis. Foals with a white blood cell count greater than 14,000 cells/ /H9262L with no clinical signs of disease and normal lung sounds should be considered foradditional diagnostic tests such as thoracic ultra-sonography. 7Ultrasonography may reveal abnor - malities of the peripheral pulmonary parenchyma.If these abnormalities are detected, a TTW and/orantibiotic treatment should be initiated. Farmswith endemic R. equi that have suffered signicant morbidity and/or mortality rates should be monitor-ing rectal temperatures twice daily, with febrilefoals selected for further testing (thoracic ultra-sonography) or treatment. In ultraso-nography (starting at 3-4 wk of age until 3 mo ofage) has proven to be very effective for early diseaserecognition and reduction of mortality attributed toR. equi pneumonia on several endemic farms. 3 Diagnostic thoracic ultrasonography has been shown to be an accurate alternative imaging modal-ity for detection of pulmonary pathology attributedtoR. equi pneumonia in foals when thoracic radiog- raphy is not available. Pulmonary lesions were as-signed a grade according to the severity (Table 1).The grading scale ranged from 0 (normal) to 10 (theentire lung surface is affected). A grading scalewas implemented to aid in the documentation oflesions to determine whether treatment was suc-cessful, and to help with the description of pneumo-nia. The foal's grade was determined not by thetotal number of lesions that were visualized but bythe highest grade visualized. For example, a foalwith multiple one's of the left hemithorax as well asone grade 3 would be identied as a grade 3 in theleft thorax. The rationale for this early screening isthe belief that earlier initiation of specic treatment 438 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTwill not only improve prognosis for recovery but alsoreduces the treatment period (2 rather than 4-8 wkof antibiotic treatments). Treatment was discon-tinued when the ultrasound score achieved a gradeof zero. The implementation of thoracic ultra-sonography on endemic farms seems to be highlysensitive because no foals that were diagnosed as agrade 0 developed clinical disease. The farms thatimplemented thoracic ultrasonography had no mor-talities and a marked clinical diseaseassociated with R. equi . Thoracic ultrasonography is a practical, quick, accurate, and useful diagnosticmodality when screening for R. equi. In addition, the pulmonary lesion grades should be routinelyemployed when monitoring treatments and commu-nicating the description of the lesions. 4. Treatment Although control trials to evaluate optimal treat-ment are lacking, macrolides such as azithromycinand clarithromycin have been shown to have greaterbioavailability, to be more chemically stable, andachieve high tissue as well an intracellular concen-trations, the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin hasshown that 10 mg/kg by mouth every 24 hours forthe rst 5 days of treatment and then every otherday achieve appropriate minimal inhibitory concen-trations (MIC) in bronchoalveolar cells, pulmonaryepithelial lining fluid, and in polymorphonuclearleukocytes. 8On the basis of pharmacokinetic val - ues and MIC of R. equi isolates, clarithromycin at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours can keepserum levels above the MIC 90.8Azithromycin or clarithromycin are commonly used in combination with rifampin because of their synergistic propertiesagainst R. equi. Another macrolide that has shown some promise for the use in R. equi infected foals is gamithromycin. Gamithromycin has been shownto achieve adequate levels the neutrophils andBAL cells. Intramuscular administration of gami- thromycin at a dosage of 6 mg/kg IM in the semi-membranosus/semitendinosus muscles once a weekwould maintain concentrations above MIC 90forR. equi for approximately 7 days.9,10Because of mus - cle inflammation associated with the use of thismedication, it is advisable to not administer a quan-tity greater than 4 mL in a single site. Practitio-ners have also administered flunixin meglumine at adose 1 mg/kg IV before the administration of gami-thromycin to help alleviate any pain associated withthe administration of this medication. Pharmaco-kinetic data of doxycycline in 4-8-week-old foalshave shown that oral administration at a dosage of10 mg/kg every 12 hours would maintain serum,pulmonary epithelial lining fluid, and BAL cell ac-tivity above the MIC of R. equi. 8Therefore, doxycy - cline or minocycline (4 mg/kg orally every 12 h) maybe an option for foals that have adverse reactions tothe macrolides. The author has used gentamicin (6mg/kg IV once a day) in some cases of R. equi that do not respond to conventional therapy, usually alongwith a combination of a macrolide and rifampin. It is very important to obtain a proper diagnosis and culture sensitivity when confronted with pneu-monia that has been presumptively diagnosed withR. equi. If the patient does not improve with con- ventional therapy then further diagnostics (TTW)should be explored because resistant R. equi has recently been documented. In a study documenting the prevalence of R. equi isolates resistant to macrolides or rifampin and out-come of infected foals, the overall prevalence of re-sistant isolates in Texas and Florida was 4% (12 of328 isolates submitted). 11The survival proportion of foals infected with resistant R. equi isolates (2 of 8; 25%) was signicantly (P /H11005.004) lower than that of foals receiving the same treatment from whichsusceptible isolates were cultured (55 of 79; 70%).These results underscore the importance of cultureand susceptibility testing in foals with pneumoniacaused by R. equi. 11 The overall prognosis for successful outcome (sur- vival) has been reported to be approximately 80%.Foals that recover from R. equi pneumonia and make it to the racetrack have been shown to performas well as expected. Juvenile Hyperreactive Airway Disease Juvenile hyperreactive airway disease tends to af-fect foals 4-7 months of age and is poorly under-stood. Juvenile hyperreactive airway disease is asyndrome of small-airway disease that has minimalresponse to antibiotics alone. The majority of thecases in the United States present between Juneand September. Clinical Signs Clinical signs are consistent. Foals present with ahistory of tachypnea with an exaggerated abdominalcomponent, tracheal rattle, and flared nostrils withTable 1.

Diagnosis Diagnostic tests are generally unrewarding and areusually based on clinical signs. A TTW may beperformed but usually results in a minimal growthof a variety of opportunistic bacteria. The completewhite blood cell count is typically normal with anormal brinogen concentration. Signs tend topersist despite reveal thickened bron-chioles and a mild interstitial pattern. Treatment Treatment is aimed at resolving cyanosis with intra-nasal oxygen, bronchodilators, and reducing theinflammation within the lung. Foals should beplaced on 7-10 L/min of oxygen via a nasal cannula.Bronchodilators are used to relieve the obstructionof the small airways caused by airway smooth mus-cle contraction. The administration of bronchodi-lators should always be combined with strict envi-ronmental dust control that includes soaking hayprior to feeding and removing the foal from the barnduring stall cleaning. Corticosteroid therapy helpsreduce the lower airways. Bronchodilator Therapy12 Clenbuterol (0.8-3.2 /H9262g/kg by mouth BID) is an to help clear mucus from theairways. Aminophylline (5-10 mg/kg diluted in fluids can be given BID to QID IV) is a xanthinederivative that is a bronchodilator, enhancesmucociliary clearance, increases contractilityof the diaphragm, and delays fatigue of themuscles responsible for respiration. Glycopyrrolate is used as a rescue drug when immediate bronchodilation is needed. Glyco-pyrrolate is a synthetic antimuscarinic agentthat blocks the M 3-muscarinic and causes bronchodilation (0.002-0.007 mg/kg IV SID). Inhalation bronchodilators: during severe airway obstruction these drugs have poor pul-monary distribution. Albuterol is a beta 2agonist that serves as a rescue therapy. This medication can improve pulmonary function by 70% within 5 minutesof administration. Unfortunately, the effectonly lasts 1-3 hours. Give 3-6 activations (450 mcg) BID via a me- tered dose inhaler.Nebulize 2-5 mg ranging from every 15 min- utes for 1 hour to TID to QID. Ipratropium Three activations BID via a metered 1 vial (500 mcg) TID to QID Corticosteroid Therapy Systemic dexamethasone has been demonstrated to improve lung function within hours of administra-tion with a maximal response obtained by day 7.Steroids not only reduce inflammation within thechest, but over time can up-regulate the number ofbeta 2receptors within the is administered intravenously (0.1 mg/kg) oncedaily and then for another 4-5 days (0.05 mg/kg)after clinical signs resolve. Inhaled steroid therapycan also be used in conjunction of systemic steroids. Inhaled steroids may be administered for several weeks after the systemic steroid therapy has beendiscontinued. Examples of inhaled steroids in foalsinclude the following: Fluticasone (220 mcg/activation), give 4-8 ac- tivations SID for 2 weeks and then every otherday for another 2 weeks Beclomethasone dipropionate (80 mcg/activa- tion), give 5-8 activations SID for 2 weeks andthen every other day for another 2 weeks Prevention Inhalant exposure to airborne irritants commonlyencountered in horse stables has been implicated inthe pathogenesis of inflammatory airway disease.Two main approaches can help reduce exposure ofthe horse's airways to respirable particles. Therst approach is to use feedstuff and bedding thatgenerate low dust and endotoxin concentration (pa-per and hemp). The second approach is to increaseremoval of airborne particles and noxious gases byimproving ventilation in the building. Lawsonia intracellularis associated proliferative enteropathy in avariety of species. An economically devastatingdisease of commercial pig production worldwide, L. intracellularis has been shown to have a detrimen- tal effect on average daily gain and market weight inpigs. 13,14L. intracellularis is emerging pathogen that has been re-ported worldwide. EPE typically affects younghorses, with those between 4 and 9 months particu-larly susceptible to disease. 15-17The pathogenesis of EPE involves an initial colonization of the mitot- ically active enterocytes of the crypts resulting incrypt hyperplasia. ad- /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTenomatous thickening of the mucosa (commonlynoted in the ileum), with later involvement of otherintestinal segments possible. 18In horses, EPE re - sults in hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia,15 with some horses ultimately dying from the diseasedespite aggressive care. 19 Epidemiology The epidemiology of L. intracellularis in the horse remains poorly understood although it is believedthat transmission occurs through the ingestion offecal material from wild or domestic animals. 20 Due to the signicant effect of L. intracellularis on the swine industry, progress in understanding por-cine (PPE) epidemiology is much more evolved thanit is with EPE. It has been hypothesized that PPEpersists and is transmitted within swine operationsvia poor/inadequate disinfection techniques as wellas subclinical shedders of the bacterium. Indeed,work has shown that subclinically infected pigs canefciently spread the bacterium among cohorts. 21 Although a study with bi-monthly fecal PCR testingdid identify several weanling horses that shed thebacterium in the absence of clinical signs, 20the role subclinically infected horses play in transmission remains to be determined. In one study, clinicallyaffected horses were shown to potentially play a rolein the transmission of L. intracellularis . 21It is cur - rently recommended that horses with documentedEPE not be allowed to comingle with the rest of theherd until after at least 1 week of antimicrobialtherapy. Exposure to L. intracellularis is widespread, with reports of EPE cases occurring worldwide. 22-24 In the United States, regional exposure variesgreatly, with farm-specic seroprevalence rangingfrom 14 to 100%. 17,22Interestingly, only 11% of exposed young horses will develop a form of EPE (5% clinical EPE and 6% subclinical EPE).17Themost commonly affected age groups are weanling and young yearlings, with those between 4 and 9months seeming to be most susceptible to infec-tion. 13On occasion, EPE has been diagnosed in older horses up to 17 years of age at the author's clinic. These older horses typically have an addi-tional underlying disease process (unpublisheddata). In North America, the disease is often de-tected between August and January, 15,22although cases outside of this timeframe have been reported.15 It was once hypothesized that exposure to pig feces is a potential source of infection for horses.However, in most cases of EPE, no history or evi-dence of exposure to pigs or pig feces has been re-ported. 25Molecular typing of equine isolates using variable number tandem repeat has demonstrated a clear distinction between the isolates obtained fromporcine and equine species. 26Rabbits may repre - sent an effective reservoir/amplier host due to theirlarge population, close contact with horses, theirshort reproductive cycle, and their worldwide distri-bution. Recent work has examined a possible role ofrabbits in the epidemiology of EPE. 27 Clinical Signs EPE is generally seen in weaned horses less thanone year of age. Clinical signs are usually nonspe-cic and include lethargy, pyrexia ( /H1102238.5\u00b0C), an- orexia, peripheral edema (Fig. 9), weight loss (Fig.10), colic, and diarrhea. 15,16,27Due to the nonspe - cic nature of the clinical signs, diagnostic testingmay be necessary to rule out protein loss in the urineas well as peritoneal and pleural cavities. Forthose horses that recover, the recovery period cantake weeks to months before they regain the appear-ance of unaffected cohorts. Diagnostic Tests Although the denitive diagnosis of EPE requiresdirect observation of L. intracellularis within en- terocytes of the hyperplastic small intestine at nec- Fig. 4.

The use of a 2.5-5.0-MHz ultrasonographicprobe is preferred to obtain a depth of 8-20 cm.Although a linear rectal probe may provide suf-cient depth to detect thickened small intestine, anegative result using such a probe should not ruleout EPE. By itself, small intestinal wall thicknessgreater than 3 mm is not pathognomonic for EPE, 22 but increased thickness (Fig. 11) accompanied bycompatible clinical and clinicopathologic signs ishighly suspicious. Practitioners should avoid rely-ing solely on abdominal ultrasonography for EPEdiagnosis given that EPE cases can have normalsmall intestinal wall thickness, 15and other patho - logic conditions can cause small intestine co-lonic edema, which cause the dependent edema seen in clinical EPEcases, are the most consistent laboratory ndingassociated with EPE. 17,19,22The pathophysiology of hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia is still under debate. Replication of L. intracellularis re- sults in the proliferation and hyperplasia of the rap-idly dividing cells of the crypts, leading to anoverpopulation of immature epithelial cells lackingmicrovilli. 28These immature epithelial cells, with the capability to be secretory,27,29replace mature epithelial cells lining small intestinal villi, likely resulting in a malabsorptive state and subsequent Fig. 6.

Grade 6 cavitated pulmonary abscess located in theventral tip of the lung. Fig. 9. Note the throat latch and muzzle edema on this malabsorptive state fur - ther supported by evidence that EPE-affected horsesexperience a diminished ability to absorb glucose. 31 Recent evidence for a protein-losing component ofEPE exists based on case reports of acute deathfollowing enterocyte infection with L. intracellu- laris. The horses in these reports experienced sec-ondary bacteremia/septicemia and necrotizing enteritis, suggesting that pathogenic bacteria wereable to penetrate the mucosal epithelial layer inareas with concurrent L. intracellularis infection. 7 It stands to reason that if pathogenic bacteria wereable to penetrate through this layer into the bloodstream, protein could be exuded into the lumen ofthe gastrointestinal tract via those same, damagedareas. According to Starling's Law, the hyproproteine- mia seen with EPE results in lower plasma oncoticpressure and a net movement of free fluid from thecirculation into tissues. It is important to note thattotal protein and albumin values decrease rapidly inclinical EPE cases as previous work has shown atotal protein decrease of 3 g/dL can occur over thespan of 4-7 days. 32Although the actual values are dependent on the laboratory used, total protein con- centrations are generally below 5-5.2 g/dL with al-bumin concentrations below 3-3.1 g/dL. 13,15There are a number of conditions that can also result in decreased total protein and albumin levels, includ-ing renal disease, peritonitis, pleuritis, salmonello-sis, colitis, and intestinal parasites; therefore, it isimperative that a thorough physical examinationalong with other conrmatory diagnostics be per-formed before a diagnosis of EPE is made. Given that L. intracellularis infections are located in the intestinal enterocytes and clinical cases ofEPE usually lack an intestinal inflammatory re-sponse, 18other clinicopathologic tests such as com - plete blood counts and brinogen levels are nottypically useful for EPE diagnosis. 22Metabolic ab -normalities are unusual except in cases with severe diarrhea, chronic cases, or in cases with concurrentdisease. 15Necrotizing EPE cases were found to have varying degrees of leukocyte count abnormali- ties, and although coagulation diagnostics were notperformed, these cases exhibited signs of dissemi-nated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 9Infarc - tions of the small intestine and kidneys associatedwith EPE have also been documented by the author. Fecal PCR Fecal PCR for L. intracellularis is a highly specic test that detects sequences of bacterium-specicDNA. 18However, the sensitivity of L. intracellu - laris-specic fecal PCR testing is variable,33-36 given that there are a variety of PCR inhibitors in feces and it is believed that the bacterium is onlyintermittently shed in the feces of infected horses.Another problem with fecal PCR diagnostics is thatfecal shedding stops after 4-6 days of antimicrobialadministration. 20With respect to EPE sample col - lection, a study concluded that feces and rectalswabs yielded similar PCR results for L. intracellu- laris, demonstrating that rectal swabs can be con- sidered as an alternative sample type for patientswith decreased or no fecal output. 37 Serologic Testing Several L. intracellularis -specic serologic assays currently exist for use in assay tobe developed, the immunoperoxidase monolayer as-say (IPMA), was initially used in pigs, 21but has since been adapted for commercial use in horses. Additional tests are also available for use in horses,including a modied version of the IPMA, a blockingELISA (outside of the United States), and a newindirect ELISA. 38All of the serologic tests, with the exception of the blocking ELISA, seem to be highly specic for L. intracellularis exposure.39 Fig. 10. Weight loss in a 6-month-old Thoroughbred colt. Fig. 11. Serosal edema of 0.6 cm in a 7-month-old Thoroughbredwith signs of colic and depression. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 443HOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTAll of these tests rely on the detection of L. intra- cellularis -specic antibodies, which suggest expo- sure, but are not necessarily indicative of clinicalEPE or ongoing infection. It is important for prac-titioners to note that the severity of exposure andinfection cannot be inferred from the titer becausethe antibody response of an individual to the bacte-rium is dependent on multiple factors. Seroconver-sion in the horse has been documented to occurapproximately 14 days following large-dose experi-mental challenges, whereas most begin showingclinical signs of EPE by day 19-21. 23It is essential to combine both molecular and serologic testing given that these modalities have high analyticalspecicity but may have variable sensitivity, espe-cially early in the course of disease. To the author'sknowledge there are only four commercial diagnos-tic laboratories in the United States that offer sero-logical testing for L. intracellularis. a,b,c,d Treatment Treatment of EPE consists of supportive care incombination with specic antimicrobials directedagainst L. intracellularis . Supportive plasma trans-fusions, parenteral nutrition, starch 130/0.4 eadministered at 10 mL/kg IV. Plasma can also be given after the hy- droxyethyl starch 130/0.4eat a rate of 4-10 mL/kg IV. The author has noted that in an average250-kg weanling, the albumin level may increase0.1-0.3 g/dL for ever y1Lo f plasma administered. Patients with a protein-losing enteropathy such asEPE may also have decreased antithrombin levels,increasing the risk of a hypercoaguable state. Thus,medications used to prevent platelet aggregation maybe of some benet. These medications may IU/kg SQ or IV TID), clopidogrel f(4 mg/kg by mouth SID loading dose then 2 mg/mL by mouth SID) or aspirin (10 mg/kg by mouth SID or 17mg/kg by mouth EOD). The use of antimicrobials that are able to reach therapeutic concentrations within the cytoplasm ofthe infected enterocyte is required due to the intra-cellular nature of L. intracellularis . Although suc- cessful treatment of L. intracellularis has been documented with the use of the macrolides (azithro-mycin [10 mg/kg by mouth SID] the author does not recommendthe use of macrolide antibiotics in adults or animalsgreater than 500 lbs due to the increased risk for colitis. Other antimicrobial treatment options in-clude tetracycline-class drugs to QID 1-2 wk). Althoughsome clinical improvement (e.g., appetite and fever)can occur rapidly following treatment, it can takeweeks for total protein and albumin levels to normalize. The vaccine protocol that yielded the strongest immunological responses was intrarectal adminis-tration of 30 mL of either the lyophilized (50 dose/100 mL vial) or the frozen-thawed formulation of theavirulent L. intracellularis vaccine ggiven twice, 30 days apart (Fig. 12). The L. intracellularis vaccine is safe and the administration well tolerated byhorses. Further, the vaccine has not been associ-ated with the induction of clinical disease in pigs orhorses, although fecal shedding up to 12 days hasbeen documented following extra-label intra-rectalvaccine administration in foals. 40 Biosecurity Assessment Introduction When arriving to a farm for routine vaccination care, one should also inquire about biosecurity of thefarm, especially if it is a breeding facility. The equine community has always recognized vet- erinarians as a resource for spreading knowledgeand preventing infection. The community's percep-tion is that we are infection preventionists who havethe knowledge about the pathophysiology of infec-tious disease so we must also have the knowledge of Fig. 12. Enterisol\u00ae 50 dose 100-mL avirulent culture vaccinethat is used /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTinfection prevention, control and epidemiology.Veterinarians now have expanded roles when itcomes to biosecurity and biocontainment. Our intellectual knowledge does not come for free. We must feel comfortable charging for services thatinclude travel time, time spent performing the siteevaluation, and time spent writing a report. Theauthor will describe how our practice incorporates abiosecurity and biocontaiment program into a prac-tice builder and revenue. The application of biosecurity and biocontainment procedures is important for equine breeding facili-ties. A biosecurity assessment should be approachedas would a physical examination. The basic objec-tives are to identify deciencies in the facility de-sign, standard operating procedures, training, andthe animal housing/movement. Before you arriveat the facility you must have the owner(s)/employ-ee(s) dedicated to the evaluation. Just going through the motions of having an evaluation per-formed to comply with the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration may get you nowhere. Dur-ing your visit you would want to talk to managersand personnel to get a feel of how standard operat-ing procedures are followed. Ask questions such ashow are aborting mares, animals with diarrhea, andnew arrivals handled? Question several of the per-sonnel to determine whether they are consistentwith their answers. Emphasize before you visit thefacility that they should change nothing before yourarrival. Observe activities and take plenty of pho-tographs. Take notes so that when you leave thefacility you will be able to easily recall your ndings.Unfortunately, most of the time when we get calledout for a biosecurity assessment it is because of anoutbreak situation. Ideally, an assessment shouldbe performed under normal circumstances. One of the targeted elements for disease preven- tion is the transmission of the infectious agent.We know from previous studies that greater than20% of foals by 6 months of age will have infectiousdiarrhea (The National Animal Health MonitoringSystem Equine 1998 Study). The goal of the bio-containment procedures is to prevent the transmis-sion of that infectious agent to other foals. Thetransmission of infectious agents requires three el-ements: a source (or reservoir) of the infectiousagent(s), a susceptible host with a portal of entryreceptive to the agent, and a mode of transmissionfor the agent. Identication of areas or processeswhere transmission of pathogens is likely to occur(control points) and implementation of measuresaimed at minimizing the possibility of such trans-mission, while allowing for reasonable flow andfunction within the veterinary hospital or animalfacility, is an important component of biosecurity(Fig. 13). During the assessment and developmentof the prevention and control activities targeted toinfectious diseases, the weakest link in the chain ofinfection (agent, transmission, host) needs to be con-sidered for each specic pathogen. In some situa-tions, control of the agent in a specic reservoir may be the best way to reduce disease occurrence. Chlo-rination of water is an example of destroying anagent in its reservoir or eliminating a possible modeof transmission. Strategies aimed at the level of transmission need to be tailored to the type of transmission involved.An example of a control activity targeted to airbornetransmission is the isolation of the animal to a fa-cility where there is no shared airspace or is locatedon the premises where no other animals are cur-rently housed. In many instances the best mecha-nisms to prevent disease occurrence is throughmodication of the host, such as developing or boost-ing immunity through active immunization. Othercontrol activities targeted to the host may includeimproving the nutritional status of a neglected ani-mal or providing chemoprophylaxis (antibiotics)against a variety of agents. Every effort should bemade to minimize the contact between animals witha history or clinical signs suggestive of infectiouscontagious disease or those with conrmed conta-gious disease and the remainder of the patients oranimals at a boarding facility. In developing control programs, the feasibility of a policy also needs to be assessed. Feasibility orpracticality of the policy is dependent not only on thesociodemographic factors but also the operatingneeds of the facility. For instance, there may beequine facilities that buy and sell horses on a rou-tine basis and will accept the risk of contagiousdisease outbreaks, such as Streptococcus equi ,a st h e norm, instead of isolating newly arrived horses for aperiod of time required. Cost and the availability of resources also need to be considered when developing control strategies.Implementing and maintaining even the most basicbiosecurity program requires trained personnel and Fig. 13. Adjacent stalls. Note the ability for direct nose-nosecontact through the open mesh window. Although this is not aconcern for healthy horses, it is a potential problem if sick orquarantined horses are housed adjacent to other horses.

Outbreak investigations have indicatedan association between infections and understafng;the association was consistently linked with pooradherence to hand hygiene (Fig. 14). 41-43 A surveillance component to an infection control program is essential to gauge the effectiveness ofbiosecurity policies. The type of surveillance pro-gram each facility employs needs to be determinedbased upon several factors including cost, efciency,and the number of high-risk cases routinely housedin the facility. 5. Conclusion Medical conditions in some foals can be preventedwith proper biosecurity measures that help decreasethe amount of aeroallergens/pathogens in the envi-ronment. It is important for veterinarians to bestewards for animals' health and when called out toadminister routine vaccines we should consider of-fering a biosecurity assessment of the facility proac-tively to look for ways to improve both hand hygieneand overall animal health.

Introduction The fetal immune system develops in a sterile andprotected environment, and therefore lacks anti-genic experience. Soon after birth, the newborn isexposed to the \"hostile world\" of bacteria, viruses,fungi, and parasites. The exposure to these mi-crobes both challenges the health of neonates anddrives the maturation of their immune responses.This initial immaturity of the immune response infoals is considered to be responsible for their sus-ceptibility to viral and bacterial infection, such asRhodococcus equi (R. equi ).R. equi , remains one of the most important causes of high-morbidityrespiratory disease in foals. As such, it is impor-tant to understand what part of the naivety of theneonatal immune response is responsible for thissusceptibility given that this affects our efforts toreduce the effect of this and other infectiousdiseases. 1 The immune response of the horse is composed of both innate and adaptive systems to defend againstinfections. A wide range of distinct cell types com-prise the immune system, each of which plays animportant role in both innate and adaptive immuneresponses. The lymphocytes engage in the centralrole in adaptive immunity given that they are thecells that determine the specicity of immunity-spe-cic antibody production, cytokine secretion, and cy- totoxicity. It is their response that directs theeffector limbs of the immune response, humoral im-mune response, and cell-mediated immune re-sponse. Other types of cells interact withlymphocytes either in the way of antigen presenta-tion or mediation of immunologic functions. Thesecells include: cells that eliminate invaders and ini-tiate immunity during innate immunitysuch as granulocytes (neutrophils, cells lymphocytesuch as dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages.These latter cells represent an important bridge be-tween the innate and adaptive immune responses.Although all of these cells are present in the neona-tal foal, their functionality is impaired comparedwith adult cells. B Cells Prior to birth, B cells are immunologically compe-tent, but their production of antibodies is limited inneonatal foals, although immunoglobulin produc-tion increases rapidly after birth. 1As such, passive immunity transferred via colostrum is critical given that immunoglobulins are rarely transferred to thefetus due to epitheliochorial placentation. The rel-ative concentration of h) /H11022IgM.2Neonatal ab - sorption of immunoglobulin occurs within 2 hours ofbirth and is mediated by unselective pinocytosisthrough specialized enterocytes. The maternal im-munoglobulins can be detected in the foal's circula-tion within 4-6 hours and peaks at 18-24 hours.Thereafter, these maternal immunoglobulins de-crease gradually in foals, and disappear after 1month for IgA and IgM, and after 6 months for IgGsubtypes. Production of antibodies by foal B cellscan occur in utero and steadily increases followingbirth. Very young foals can respond to vaccination,although their ability it produce all sub-types ofantibodies remains impaired until 2 months of age. 2 This age-related impairment of sub-isotype produc-tion is due, in part, to the immaturity of the T cellresponse in young foals. T Cells Functional T lymphocytes are present in equine fe-tus by day 100 of gestation and are capable of re-sponding to stimulation by day 140. 3After birth, T-cell populations undergo expansion, similar to that seen in B cells. The numerical increase in thenumber of circulating T cells is primarily due to anincrease in the CD8 /H11001T-cell population, given that the proportion of CD8 T cells increases nearly 5-fold by the fourth month of age, whereas CD4/H11001T cells remain fairly constant with age.4This selective expansion is likely in response to the foal's exposure to environmental microbes.5This change in T-cell numbers is also associated with an alteration intheir functionality as evidenced by their productionof various cytokines. Cytokines are potent regu-lators of innate and adaptive immunity. The ex-pression of key cytokines such as interferongamma (IFN- /H9253), T-cell subsets includingtype 1 helper T (Th1), type 2 helper T (Th2), type17 helper T (Th17) cells, and regulatory T cells(Treg), respectively. 6,7Decreased expression of these cytokines by peripheral T cells in neonatal foals compared with adult T cells suggests anoverall impairment of T-cell function in foals.Among all of the cytokines, the reduced productionof IFN- /H9253, an indicator of cell-mediated immune response, is considered an important contributorto the foal's susceptibility to viral and intracellu-lar bacterial infections. 8 Antigen-Presenting Cells The activation of lymphocytes is primed and modu-lated by antigen-presenting cells (APC), which func-tion as a bridge linking innate and adaptive immuneresponse. The APC engulf, process, and presentantigens to T cells. This antigen presentation toT cells is mediated via surface molecules and thesecretion of various cytokines. This APC popula-tion is composed of the Not surprisingly, the APC ofyoung foals exhibited decreased expression of these accessory molecules and cytokines. 9Here again, the maturation of these cells into a more adult-like phenotype seems to occur in response to stimulationby environmental antigens. Respiratory Immunity The respiratory tract provides the second largestroute of exposure to invading microbes. Unfortu-nately, the immune system of the respiratory tractin foals is functionally immature. In particular,the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT),which plays an important role in the protection ofthe respiratory tract, is incomplete in foals. 10The number and competency of immune cells is impaired in foals compared with that of adult horses. Inadult horses, MALT in the respiratory tract is The appearance of the MALT begins in thefetus and gradually develops until 2 years of age.The rst appearance of isolated lymphoid nodulesoccurs in the fetus as early as 9 vestibule, nasal cavity, nodules shows a marked increaseafter birth and reaches the adult level by 2 years ofage. The nasopharyngeal tonsil forms the largestsingle mass of lymphoid tissue in the respiratorytract. However, bronchus-associated-lymphoid tis-sue is not present in the fetus and neonatal foal, andonly found in older foals. and predominately in small intrapulmonary bronchi and thesestructures are absent in the lungs of neonates.Such structures typically begin to appear by 8-22weeks of life. This age-associated distribution ofmucosal lymphoid tissues reflects a gradual matu-ration of the respiratory immunity in foals. Theassociation of the occurrence of the nodules at spe-cic sites within the tract and the areas where in-haled antigens accumulate suggests an influence ofenvironmental exposure on this development. Bronchial Alveolar Lavage Cells Not only does the distribution of respiratory lym-phoid tissue in the foals exhibit an age-related de-velopment, but the maturity of the immune cellswithin the lung also follows an age-dependent devel-opment. Besides being located in MALT, lympho-cytes are distributed diffusely throughout the lungin the walls of the airways, the mucus, parenchymatissues, and alveolar spaces. Current understand-ing of foal lymphocyte function in the lung is basedmostly on the of bronchial alveolar lavage(BAL) samples. Although lymphocytes composeapproximately 40% of the total BAL cells in adulthorses, they represent 4-6% of the cells in BALfrom neonatal foals, the remainder being macro-phages and some absolute AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 449HOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTnumber and the frequency of lymphocytes in BALfluid has been shown to increase over time. B cellsin particular are initially virtually absent at birth,although IgG-, IgM-, and IgA-producing plasmacells appear 1 week after birth and the numbers ofthe cells reaches an adult level in foals by 12 weeksof age. A reduced number of T cells in the BAL isalso seen in foals less than 6 weeks old. This re-duced number of lymphocytes present in alveoli andthe lack of available lymphocytes to participate inthe immune response in foals less than 6 weeks oldmay have relevance for foals' susceptibility to pul-monary infection. An impaired function of lungT cells is also evident in neonatal foals as theyexhibit low expression of cytokine, particularlyIFN /H9253. However, over time there is increased expres- sion of this cytokine likely as the result of exposureto environmental antigens. 5Together, these de - ciencies likely provide the opportunity for infectionsto occur. Environmental exposure to antigens likely drives the maturation of the immune system. This post-natal exposure leads to both the recruitment of cellsinto secondary lymphoid sites and can play a role indirecting the immune response toward a speciccytokine response. Thus, early exposure to bacte-rial antigens is thought to favor the induction ofTh1-type immunity and prevents the developmentof allergic and autoimmune diseases associatedwith Th2 immune responses. As such, the micro-biome of the respiratory and gastrointestinal sys-tems plays a key role in the overall development ofimmune competency in the neonate. Perturba-tions of these biomes may lead to alterations insubsequent immune responses favoring Th2 overTh1 responses. This contribution of the micro-biome in influencing immune development likelyrepresents the underlying mechanism of the \"hy-giene hypothesis.\" 11However, a recent study found no association between the gastrointestinal microbiome of healthy foals and those infectedwith Rhodococcus equi. 12 2. Clinical Application Given the immaturity of the foal's immune systemat birth, several steps can be taken to maximize itseffectiveness. Maternal antibodies are an essentialcomponent of the initial immune repertoire of thefoal. 13The importance of passive transfer and the need for the foal to acquire sufcient maternal an- tibodies cannot be overstated. A post-sucklingplasma immunoglobulin concentration of 800 mg/dLshould be considered the minimum acceptablelevel. The quality of maternal colostrum is anotherimportant consideration, referring to the amount ofantibodies present to specic agents. A mare vac-cination program, as recommended by the AmericanAssociation of Equine Practitioners (www.aaep.org),should be followed to insure the presence of ade-quate amounts of specic antibodies in the colos-trum. Natural exposure of mares to pathogens inthe environment can likewise augment her ability to provide the foal with protection. Earlier vaccina-tion of foals that have received insufcient passivetransfer or whose mares were not adequately vacci-nated should be considered. Although maternalantibodies may inhibit responses to some vaccines,there is little evidence to suggest a long-term nega-tive effect. 14,15As such, it is better to vaccinate the foal earlier rather than risk the possibility of it being unprotected.15In the case of R. equi, where no vac - cine is available, the use of Rhodococcal- specic hy- perimmune plasma should be considered for foals onendemic farms. Although this treatment will notprevent infection, a single treatment administeredafter birth can reduce the severity of clinical signs infoals that become infected. 16Variability in the ap - parent efcacy of hyperimmune plasma (HIP) in theeld may be due in part to differences in obtainedantibody levels obtained in treated foals. 17The rea - sons for this variability are unknown, although vari-ations between products and different lots within aproduct line does occur. 17Other methods of non - specically stimulating T-cell immunity in foals willlikely be unsuccessful until the foal reaches at least1 month of age based on recent studies. 18The over - all effectiveness of this approach in reducing R. equi infections in the young foal remains uncertain.19 Likewise, the effectiveness of these treatments inre-directing foal immune responses is also unknown.

This is shown to beconsistent between various locations at approximately80% of total mares bred. 1-3Previously reported eco- nomic modelling of equine of theindividual broodmare requires that six foals be pro-duced over a 7-year period, with progeny remainingviable to be sold at auction as yearlings. 4Although buyers tend to value mares on the race quality andsuccess of their offspring, 5mares without a consistent record of timely production of progeny will undoubt-edly suffer diminished value at auction. Further-more, whereas foals that experienced hospitalizationdid not suffer reduced sale price as yearlings, 6prompt detection in a primary setting and timely treatment ofproblems avoids losses due to rapid and sometimesinsidious onset of sepsis and orthopedic issues. 2. Challenges of the Post-Partum Period Foal Successful transition to extrauterine life may becomplicated by events both before and during par-turition. Once exposed to the external environ- ment, the neonate must rapidly develop alteredcardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinalfunction; stand; suckle; achieve coordinated limbmovements; and develop defenses against a myr-iad of infectious challenges. By the period of foalheat, neonates are expected to have achieved adult cardiovascular patterns; transitioned to amonogastric successfully digesting a milk-baseddiet while dietary and environmental antigen ex-posure continues unabated; increase body weightbetween 1-2 kg/day depending on to rise, ambulate without assis-tance sufciently to match the mare's movements.Although born immune decient through a lack ofpre-suckle antibodies, the foal can successfullymount a response to many infectious challengesonce sufcient colostrum has been ingested andimmunoglobulins absorbed. Where the above has not been adequately achieved, common presenting signs of the compro-mised neonate include depression, weakness, lack ofsuckle reflex, fever, hypothermia, sepsis, and neuro-logical dysfunction. 452 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENT NOTESMare It is desirable to maintain a 12-month foaling inter-val, which is achievable in mares rst rebred ontheir foal heat (average interval to conception inthese mares is 25 days). 7During this period the mare must recover physically from parturition; in- volute her uterus sufciently to receive an embryo;re-establish cyclicity at approximately 21-day inter-vals; initiate and increase lactation to meet the rap-idly accelerating nutritional requirements of thefoal; and consume feed sufcient to meet all of thesedemands while conceiving at a subsequent breedingin a timely fashion. However, whereas time of rstpost foaling ovulation ranges from 7 to 15 days,pregnancy rates in mares ovulating 10 days or morepost foaling are greater. Voluntarily not breedingon foal heat by waiting until the second post-partumestrus (around 30 d post foaling) inevitably leads todelayed conception, and eventual foregoing of abreeding season to allow earlier breeding the follow-ing year. This lost opportunity signicantly affectsthe lifetime economic return on the broodmare,without reducing ongoing maintenance and oppor-tunity costs. Mating over multiple cycles to achievepregnancy increases costs; however, this is smallcompared with the potential future sales revenue ofoffspring. This repeated attempt at establishingpregnancy, however, will delay the foaling date andpotentially decrease the sale price of the yearling. 8,9 Live foaling rate per season has been reported as 80%.1To achieve this or better, veterinary expenditure is shown in economic models to be a relatively small proportion of the total outlay for abroodmare owner, and performing the necessaryrational veterinary procedures to improve overallhealth and particularly reproductive efciency areprudent expenditures. 4 Lactation is a nutritionally demanding time for the mare. Insufcient intake to meet the require-ments of lactation results in the loss of body reservesto maintain foal growth, 10and can reduce reproduc - tive performance.11In one study of fat supplemen - tation prior to and following parturition, maressupplemented showed shorter post-partum inter-vals and fewer cycles per pregnancy, and their foalshad higher initial weight gains compared with con-trol mares and their foals. 12The preferred body condition score for mares foaling and entering early lactation to enhance breeding efciency has beendetermined to be 5/9. 11 3. Examination of the Foal Gross appearance of the foal is affected by in utero events (Appendix 1). Prematurity occurs when afoal is delivered before the expected gestationallength, often after a seemingly uneventful preg-nancy. Their relative immaturity as indicated byshort soft hair coat, flaccid ears and lips, small skel-etal and comparatively smallskeletal size, and tendinous laxity similar to a pre- mature foal; however, they experience a prolongedgestation. Placental insufciency is considered acontributing factor. Postmaturity is where an oth-erwise-normal foal results from a prolonged gesta-tion, being of a more appropriate skeletal size butwith a decreased muscle mass. As in utero resi- dence increases, skeletal growth continues taxingplacental function, precipitating a relative placentalinsufciency. Disturbances of in utero maturity of the foal pre- dispose the foal to orthopedic, pulmonary, neurolog-ical, and infectious pathologies. At birth, a foal is approximately 10% of its mature body weight, reaching 30% by 3 months of age.The most rapid period of growth occurs close toparturition meaning any nutritional or physiologicalchecks at this time may have signicant effects. 13 Managerial influence on foal growth is mediated viabroodmare health and nutrition governing milk pro-duction. Failure to thrive or loss of body weight isan indication of an underlying disease process caus-ing reduced feed intake, inappetence, or catabolism. Examination of the foal begins with a good history of events at the time of delivery and in the immedi-ate few days afterward. The neonatal foal seeks within minutes ofbirth. 14The majority of foals stand within 1 hour of delivery, with pony foals requiring less time and larger breeds taking up to 2 hours (range, 15-165min). 14Compromised neonates tend to remain re - cumbent longer. Initial attempts to stand arepoorly coordinated in all foals; however, once stand-ing the foal rapidly develops an appropriate postureand moves freely in search of the mare. At the timeof foal heat evaluation, the foal should seem coordi-nated and move freely. Within 5 to 10 minutes of birth the suckle reflex is present. Foals actively seek to suckle, and even therecumbent foal makes suckling motions into the sur-roundings. Most foals suckle the mare within 2hours of birth (breed and size variations) withgreater than 3 hours considered an abnormal nd-ing. 14At foal heat, the foal should be regularly and vigorously suckling the mare, without loss of milk from the mouth or nares. Checklist for Examination Behavior and Activity Level Foals are inquisitive but quickly develop a strong avoidance of handling, seeking shelter on the farside of the mare. If recumbent, the healthy foal iseasily roused and quickly seeks the mare forsuckling. Head The head and face should appear symmetrical. Mucous membranes should be pink and moist.The forehead and nares should be free of milk stain-ing. Eyes should be free from discharge, with clear AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 453HOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTcorneas and a pupillary light response that is com-plete but slow compared with adults.ThoraxRespiratory effort should not be labored, and rateshould be regular. Palpation of the thoracic wall ina dorsal to ventral direction, beginning cranially andproceeding caudally over all ribs should not detectpain, soft tissue swelling, or crepitus suggestive ofrib fractures. This is especially important over theregion immediately behind the elbows over theheart. Auscultation should reveal prominent bron-chovesicular sounds over the entire thorax. Thecardiac rate will be rapid and labile due to excite-ment. A flow murmur (systolic) will be auscultableon the left side. The presence of a continuous orright-sided murmur is not expected.AbdomenThe abdominal wall should not be tense, and free ofpain upon palpation. The umbilical remnantshould be pain free upon palpation, dry, and reducedin size from that expected on a newborn foal. Theumbilical ring in the body wall should be closelyapplied the urachal remnant; however, a smallumbilical hernia ( /H110212.5 cm) is common. Gut sounds should be present over all abdominal quadrants.Milk feces are expected over the perineal region.LimbsLimbs should be free of overt laxity and contracture.A mild degree of carpal valgus is to be expected.Elbows may still be slightly adducted leading to theappearance from directly in front of the foal ofthe limb being rotated outward. Alignment withthe dorsal aspect of the limb better ascertains con-formation. The heels should be free of abrasions.Swelling and pain over joints, physes, and tendinousstructures should not be present. Common Areas of Concern Congenital DisordersCongenital abnormalities are generally uncommon.More serious and potentially life-threatening conditions include microophthalmia, cleftpalate, mouth\"), scoliosis, and immune deciencies.More serious conditionsthat require timely intervention include scrotal, digits). Hernia signicance depends upon size, location and ease of reduction. Umbilical hernias are notuncommon, being usually small ( /H110212.5 cm diameter) and easily reducible. Spontaneous resolution is ex-pected within a few days when complications are notpresent (incarcerated viscera, omentum, infection).The presence of heat, pain, or a steady increase in size warrants investigation. Scrotal hernias usu-ally are easily reducible, resolve spontaneously, andonly rarely incarcerate intestine (Fig. 1). Abnor-mal content (thickened amotile bowel wall) is read-ily apparent with and concurrentpain is expected. Inguinal hernias appear as softswellings the inguinal/scrotal area, and can beconfused for scrotal hernias. A rent in the bodywall or vaginal tunic allows intestine to dissectalong the subcutaneous tissues. Repair is surgical,and if longstanding, ischemia may occur or adhe-sions may form compromising the intestine. Orthopedic Ossication of the cuboidal bones occurs within the last 2-3 months of gestation. 15Immaturity and dysmaturity of the foal therefore can affect this pro- cess. Other conditions associated with incompleteossication include short gestation, placental ab-normalities, and maternal illness. Stresses are ap-plied to the lateral aspect of the carpus (intermedi-ate, ulnar, third and fourth carpal bones), and thesagittal plane of the tarsus (central and third tarsalbones). A small degree of carpal valgus causinguneven weight loading of the carpus is common atbirth. More severe deviations can distort thosecuboidal bones under increased stress (as above),resulting in increasing limb deviation and degener-ative joint disease. Varus deformity similarly dis-torts weight loading across the cuboidal bones.Should incomplete ossication be present, early di-agnosis is critical to preserve athletic function.Serial radiographs and restricted exercise (stall con-nement) are necessary, with supportive limb cast-ing sometimes needed to preserve alignment andcuboidal bone structure while ossifying. Where acute lameness is noted, sepsis of physes or synovial surfaces should be considered the primaryrule out before trauma is considered.

Persistence of fetal circulation past this timesuggests an anomaly (septal de-fect, pulmonarydisease pulmonary pressures elevated, in-creasing cardiac workload, depressing cardiac out-put, and countering normal cessation of right to leftshunting of blood in the extrauterine environment.Holosystolic (continuously audible between S1 andS2) murmurs located in the pulmonic or aorticvalves area are flow murmurs and not of concern.Murmurs that warrant further investigation are ofhigh intensity (grade III/VI or greater), associatedwith signs of exercise intolerance, and persist pastthe rst week of life.RespiratoryThoracic excursion is an indication of respiratoryeffort. An increased rate may indicate compro-mised pulmonary function, pain, excitement, or fe-ver. Tachypnea during disease is most consistentlyrelated to diffuse pulmonary changes. Nostril flar-ing may also indicate increased effort. Nasal dis-charge should never be present, a mucoid dischargemay indicate a respiratory tract infection, and amilk discharge can be associated with congenitalabnormalities (cleft palate, pharynx) or an inabilityto swallow due to botu-lism, Se deciency myopathy, hypoxic insult). If suspected, the chest should be palpated to as- sess for the presence of rib fractures indicated bycrepitus and subcutaneous fluid swelling if unstable;however, it is likely that callus formation has en-sued over the period between delivery and the timeof foal heat examination of the mare. The majorityof fractures are adjacent to the costochondral junc-tion. Gross asymmetry of the thoracic cage may bevisualized or palpated. Pain and altered thoracicexcursion may be seen; this may be manifest astachypnea and tachycardia. A flail segment (un-stable due to discontinuity in more than one placealong a rib) may move in a paradoxical fashion al-though is likely to have been observed prior to foal-heat examination. If fractured rib ends are non-displaced or closely apposed, conservative management is indicated, be-ing stall connement and periodic examination(weekly) until callus formation is complete, usually2-3 weeks. If fracture ends are unstable, or areimpinging on intrathoracic structures (lungs, heart),or signs of hemorrhage are present (anemia, pleural fluid), more aggressive management is indicated,being direct surgical stabilization of the fracturesites. Umbilical Region The umbilicus rapidly retracts and heals post deliv- ery. Umbilical herniation appears as a smoothpendulous swelling at the site of the umbilicus.This may be soft and easily reducible, or rm andirreducible if incarceration of content (omentum, in-testine) or abscessation has occurred. With ura-chal patency, urine leakage causes wetting of thehair in the umbilical stump area, regional scalding,and dermatitis, which further promotes infection.Heat, swelling and pain upon palpation are foundwith infection of the umbilical stump. This mayascend caudodorsally along the urachus, umbilicalarteries, or cranioventrally along the umbilical vein.Purulent discharge may be evident at the urachalopening in severe cases in addition to episodic orconstant urine leakage. General malaise, fever, de-pression, polysynovitis, septic arthritis, and septicphysitis may follow bacteremia sourced from theumbilical infection. Integument Skin abrasions, especially those associated with bony prominences near joints, should be closely ex-amined as direct introduction of sepsis into joints ispossible with full-thickness defects. Entropion re-sults from a relative excess of skin in the periorbitalregion in the immediate post-partum period, and ifpersistent will lead to chronic corneal ulceration.At foal heat, entropion should be absent having beenpreviously addressed, and if present, suggestsmarked weight loss or signicant dehydration.The possibility of corneal ulceration should be ruledout. heat evaluation, by denition, foal heat diar- rhea is likely present in the foal. This represents anormal colonization and maturation phase of theintestinal tract. It should be of short duration (afew days), self-limiting, and cause no overt depres-sion or signs of illness in the foal. Treatment isseldom necessary, and only supportive in nature.Diarrhea that persists longer, increases in magni-tude, and results in inappetence, fever, or depres- sion is infectious until disproven.

If the hernia sack ruptures,edema forms in the inguinal region or ventrally onthe abdominal wall, this necessitating surgicalcorrection. 4. Examination of the Mare Reproductive The requirement to rebreed the mare prompts ex-amination at foal heat, otherwise no opportunity forevaluation of the mare may be available in the earlypost-partum period (Appendix 2). Integrity of the perineum is vital for health of the reproductive tract. Early placement of a Caslicksuture post foaling is shown to improve reproductiveperformance, with mares sutured at 48 hours postfoaling having increased pregnancy rates than thosesutured at foal heat, making it imperative that anyfurther delay is avoided. 19Ultrasonography of the genital tract beginning at 7-9 days post-partum will allow determination of the time of rst ovulation,with those mares ovulating before 10 days known tohave a reduced pregnancy rate and higher embry-onic losses. 20A decision can then be made to breed if appropriate or induce luteolysis and initiate a more fertile cycle. Uterine involution should becomplete at this time, with no evidence of intralu-minal fluid. Ovarian activity should be obvious,with follicular development progressing and endo-metrial edema present. General Health Examination of the oral cavity and particularly theteeth is important. As the mare is under consider-able nutritional stress, the ability to consume anadequate ration and digest the contents dependsupon integrity of the dental arcade. Malalignmentand pain compromise mastication, potentially re-ducing digestibility of the ration and increasing thechances of esophageal obstruction. Lameness limits mobility regardless of the source (hooves, joints) and may precipitate stress with anyassociated pain. Ability to forage is reduced, andelevation of stress hormones exacerbates insulin re-sistance and depresses hormones involved in pro-moting cyclical activity. 21Close inspection of the hooves and at minimum flexion testing is indicated in the lame foal heat mare. Skin reflects general health but may in itself un- dergo pathology. Hypertrichosis and hyperhidrosisare classical ndings of localized or generalized dis-tribution. Dermatophilosis is relatively commonwith a characteristic appearance, and while easilytreated is not always addressed. Previously un-seen sarcoids, cutaneous masses, or neoplastic le-sions may also be noticed at this time of closerexamination post foaling. In addition to milk pro-duction, the mammary gland should be examined forsigns of cutaneous previously tu- mors or sarcoids, mastitis. Endocrine and metabolic dysfunction may be sug- gested by coat changes (as above) and conformationalchanges related to loss of muscle mass and abnormalsubcutaneous adipose tissue deposition. Areas ofnote include the tailhead, behind withers, in thesupraorbital fossa, and most signicantly, over thenuchal ligament. Other compatible clinical signs in-clude increased water intake, the presence of chronicinfections (sinusitis, pneumonia, endometritis, cutane-ous), and periods of somnolence. Laminitis in associ-ation with fresh grass access, or without a concurrentprovoking condition, is suggestive but not conrma-tory of insulin resistance. Feed requirements increase markedly over main- tenance once lactation begins, with mares' dry mat-ter intake regularly achieving 2-3% of bodyweight, 22with energy and protein needs also chal - lenging to meet. Essential amino acid intake canalso be difcult to achieve in the absence of high-quality protein. Where forage quality is average,concentrate intakes should be in the range of 0.5-1%of body weight. Where lower-quality forage isgiven or intake restricted, larger amounts of concen-trates are needed with the caveat that high grainintakes increase the risk of digestive disturbances.Therefore, higher-quality forages providedfor lactating mares when possible. High concen-trate intakes should be divided into two or threeservings per day. 5. Timely Interventions and Opportunities to Add Value Ultrasonography of the Foal The preferred ultrasound probe for younger foal ex- amination a microconvex probe with a narrow foot-print, of higher frequency (5-10 MHz range). Moststructures can also imaged by use of a rectalprobe (5-6 MHz range); however, it may be moredifcult to achieve an acceptable acoustic window insome locations due to probe length and shadowingby bony structures (e.g., ventral thoracic wall). Lungs Ultrasonography allows assessment of thepleural space and supercial lung parenchyma, withdeeper structures visible where consolidation or ab-scessation is present. Placing the probe in the in-tercostal space parallel to the ribs maximizes theacoustic window; the probe is generally placed per-pendicular to the thoracic wall; however, areasshielded by the ribs can be assessed by sweeping theultrasound beam horizontally. Assessment of thecranial thorax (cranial to the intercostal space)presents that the triceps mus-culature covers this area; however, the probe can beplaced under the right triceps musculature with theprobe angled toward the left shoulder to image thecranial mediastinum. Evaluation of the lung elds /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: important for those foals with reportedperiods of recumbency or suspected milk aspirationearlier in life no matter how brief the observedduration. Normal aerated lung appears as a hyperechogenic line in motion, parallel to the thoracic wall, timedwith ventilation efforts. Inflammatory changes ap-pear as comet-tail artifact (hyperechoic lines radiat-ing perpendicularly to the pulmonary surface)resulting from irregularities in the pulmonary mar-gins (Fig. 2). Consolidation and abscessation ap-pear as less echogenic structures replacing the usualhyperechogenic pulmonary surface, and extend intothe parenchyma. A hyperechogenic de-lineation between aerated and non-aerated tissue(abscess, consolidated lung) can be noted. Rib Fractures Rib fractures are most common in primiparousmares or following dystocia. 23Ribs 3 through 8 onthe left side are most commonly affected.24They have been demonstrated to be more readily detected by ultrasonography than radiography in neonatalfoals. 25Rib cortices appear as a continuous hyper - echoic line, with discontinuity of the hyperechoicborder of the ribs readily noted and suggestive offracture. Disposition of the resulting fragments ispossible to ascertain. Associated hematomas (sub-cutaneous, intramural) can also be detected andtheir extent assessed (Fig. 3). Abscessation is pos-sible by hematogenous spread from a remote site. Umbilical Region The urachus usually retracts after birth becomingthe median ligament of the bladder. 26When re - gression is uncomplicated, ultrasonography revealsit to be of uniform echogenicity, with a total widthadjacent to the bladder of less than 25 mm. 27In- fections appear as enlargement and thickening ofthe umbilical remnant, with hypoechoic to echogenicfluid rarely hyperechoic gas if anaerobic infectionis present. 27Chronic urachal infections may be- come encapsulated abscesses. The umbilical vein travels along the ventral midline from the externalumbilicus to the liver and in health it is a smallvessel with a thin wall and anechoic content (diam-eter at midpoint, 2-9 mm). 26The infected umbili - cal vein becomes enlarged with longstandinginfection causing prominent wall thickening. Lu-minal content may be anechoic or be highly echo-genic. Infection may extend cranially into the liver,resulting in abscessation. The umbilical arteries travel laterally to the ura- chus caudally from the site of the umbilicus. Theyare readily imaged by applying the ultrasound probetransversely across the midline of the ventral abdo-men. The arteries are distinct from adjacent struc-tures, being thick walled and containing ahyperechoic center (clotted blood) initially but re-gress rapidly in the absence of pathology. 26If Fig. 2.

Body Weight of the Foal A Thoroughbred foal should be able to increase bodyweight in the range of 1-2 kg/d. 28,29In a study of foals fed milk replacer, during the rst 2 weeks (1.73 kg/d). 30Although compensatory growth is reported, early intervention in situations of foal weight loss or diminished gain minimizesrequirement for growth promotion via dietary ma-nipulation later, reducing potential for develop-mental orthopedic disease. Although a scale is de-sirable, weight taping to uncover trends is sufcientin most cases. Charts of expected foal weight gain,body weight, and wither height are available. 31 Conformation Equine veterinarians should practice continuouslymonitoring foals from 2 weeks of age to ensure thatconformational issues are detected early and correc-tive measures can be instituted conservatively,where possible, to minimize the requirement for sur-gical intervention in more long-standing conditions.Conformation examination should involve observingthe foal standing and at the walk. The observershould position themselves perpendicular to thelimb, not the foal, given that rotation can give theappearance of limb deviation. A toe-out conforma-tion of the front limbs is common in neonates due toincomplete thoracic expansion, which remedies withincreased age and muscularity. 32 Incomplete Ossication Where limbs are appropriately aligned, stall rest,exercise restriction, and corrective trimming tomaintain a balanced hoof may resolve the condition when ossication is near complete. External coap-tation (splints, casts) is required where ossicationis poor, and aim to support and maintain a deviatedlimb in proper alignment. Stopping the splint orcast above the fetlock joint avoids weakening sup-porting ligamentous structures or promotion of os-teopenia. Serial (weekly) radiographs are essentialto monitor progress and modify treatment (Fig. 5).Lateral and dorso-palmer views of the carpus, andlateral and dorso-plantar views of the tarsus arerecommended. If the condition has not been ad-dressed prior to foal heat examination, and exerciserestrictions have not been in place, deformation ofthe cuboidal bones is highly likely. Flexural Deformities If still present at foal management. Foals that weeks of birth have the best athletic prog-nosis. 32Conservative management in the form of judicious heel lowering, toe extensions, and con- trolled exercise (limited small paddock turn out orregular walking) will improve milder cases. Ban-daging, splinting, and casting are sufcient to re-solve the majority of more affected cases thatrequire external coaptation for correction. Wherepossible, weight bearing of the limb should be pro-moted to facilitate elongation of flexor structures.Lightweight splints can be fashioned from PVC pipe.Bandaging should be changed at least every 2 daysto help avoid pressure sores. The period of treat-ment may be prolonged in severe cases, with surgi-cal intervention necessary in the most affected casesthat fail to respond to other treatments. Clientsshould be informed that with persistent distalinterphalangeal joint involvement, distal check lig-ament desmotomy or deep digital flexor tenotomy(salvage only) may be necessary. For intractablemetacarpophalangeal/metatarsophalangeal con- tracture, proximal check ligament desmotomy maybe necessary. The use of oxytetracycline to aid relaxation of flexor structures is well described. 33A dose of 50 mg/kg IV administered slowly, preferably diluted in intravenous fluids (calcium free) is in common us-age. Although improvement can be noted with asingle dose, daily dosing for 3 days may be required.Monitoring of renal function (creatinine) is prudent,and care should be exercised with use in compro-mised foals due to potential nephrotoxicity. Ef-cacy is greatest in the rst few days, of life, withdiminished response expected in older foals. Analgesia with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (flunixin, ketoprofen) is indicated to alleviatethe pain associated with stretching of soft tissuesand promote limb loading during exercise. Oncetreatment is initiated, progress should be monitoreddaily until an acceptable level of resolution has beenachieved. Fig. 4. Enlarged urachus suggestive of radiograph of a 320-d gestation foal.

If still present at foal heatexamination, initiation of a controlled exercise pro-gram and corrective farriery (heel extensions) arerequired. Bandaging must be carefully applied toachieve protection of volar structure but avoid exac-erbation of ligamentous laxity. Angular Deformities At foal heat, valgus deviations may be considerednormal if mild and are usually present from birth.The exception is incomplete ossication of the cuboi-dal bones. Varus deviation is a less favorable con-formation. At foal heat, carpal/tarsal valgus ifminor in degree, does not yet require aggressivemanagement. Corrective farriery (trimming,glue-on shoes) will resolve the majority of minorcases. Conservative management with hoof exten-sions (medial for varus) can be similarlyconservatively managed for 2-3 weeks; however,due to the more rapid closure of physes in the distallimb, periosteal transection may be necessary soonafter this period if resolution has not occurred. Where external coaptation is necessary for more profound deviations, regular changing of splints (3-4d) and casts (10-14 d) is advisable to avoid decubitalulcerations. Muscular weakness and tendinous lax-ity resulting from immobilization responds quickly totime and exercise. Advanced custom t braces allowmovement while promoting alignment. Axial deformity (bench knees), is not amenable to correction. Similarly, rotational deformities distalto the carpus or tarsus are most likely not correct-able. In both cases, the hoof should be trimmed tomaintain balance and efforts directed toward man-aging any metacarpophalangeal deviations from ax-ial deformity. Gastrointestinal Disease Given that neonates are very susceptible to gastroin-testinal pathogens, it is important to determine etiol-ogy of persistent diarrhea with diagnostic sampling (comprehensive PCR panel or culture with consider-ation of farm history) early in the season (Table 1).A compromised and persistently diarrheic foal pre-sented at the time of foal heat diarrhea may be anindex case of an outbreak. Foals less than 2 weeks ofage are particularly susceptible to dehydration andsecondary bacterial infection. Intravenous fluids andsupportive care should be proactively given. Mare Dental work is often delayed due to pregnancy,whether for concerns regarding sedation or potentialbacteremia in the presence of gingivitis or decay.The nutritional stress the lactating mare faces tomeet the needs of the rapidly growing foal necessi-tates timely and effective dental care. Dental careat reproductive examination during the foal heatperiod is likely the rst opportunity post foaling theveterinarian will have input if foaling and the neo-nate have avoided complications to that time. Discussion of nutritional adequacy of the mare at foal heat is timely, given that any weight loss postfoaling is likely already evident. Mares that foal indecreased body condition, or those that lose body re-serves in early lactation, have reduced reproductiveperformance requiring more time to initiate cyclicityand more cycles to conceive. 11,34In a study of mares fed under range conditions with limited supplemental feeding, lactating mares in moderate body conditiontended to skip a breeding season, and body conditionscore 5 proved to be marginally acceptable in lactatingmares. 35This emphasizes the necessity for close ob - servation of body condition at foaling and in the earlylactation period. Condition scoring of pregnantmares is more representative of body weight changesas the weight of the fetus and uterus are discounted.Visual body condition scoring is augmented by palpa-tion of fat deposits, chiefly over the ribs, tail, head, andvertebral spines, which avoids the effects of abdominaldistension Endocrine and metabolic investigation is indi- cated in those mares with compatible histories orappearances.

A review of foal diarrhoea from birth to LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTpersistent uterine infections that are challengingto clear. However, cyclical activity may continueand mares without uterine infection can be bredsuccessfully. In others, cyclic irregularities(anestrus, delayed ovulation) may be present.If these mares are bred, anecdotal reports indicatea lower likelihood of carriage to term and deliveryof a healthy foal. Insulin has a major role in theregulation of ovarian steroidogenesis, folliculardevelopment, and granulosa cell proliferation inother species. 36Insulin resistance has been rec - ognized as the major factor related to polycysticovary syndrome, the most common endocrine dis-order in women of reproductive age, characterizedby hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation. 37Al- though information relating specically to is scant, abnormalities in cyclicity have beendemonstrated in obese mares with reduced insulinsensitivity, being inter-ovulatory andluteal phases. 38Baseline screening for adreno - corticotropin can be performed at any time; how-ever, insulin and glucose measurements are bestperformed after overnight fasting. Recent infor-mation suggests concurrent screening for PPIDand insulin resistance may be inaccurate. 39 The average interval from foaling to rst ovulation ranges from 7 to 15 days post-partum.Mares that ovulate 10 or more days after foalingoverall have pregnancy rates higher than thosemares that ovulate on or before day 9. Maresthat conceive on foal heat breeding will have achance to advance foaling date the next year, withthose that do not conceive on the rst breeding butdo conceive on the second estrus (30 d) potentiallymaintaining a 12-month interfoaling interval.Voluntarily waiting until the 30-day estrus willinevitably lead to a drift toward later foaling datesfor the individual mare, with the eventual out-come being an open season to correct late-seasonfoaling. There are signicant economic implica-tions for allowing a mare to establish a pattern ofprogressively later foaling dates. 4Foal heat breeding of mares complications(dystocia, retained mares are bestscheduled for a subsequent estrus period (30 d oradvanced with prostaglandin usage). A practical approach is to examine mares by ultra- sonography on days 7 and/or 9 post foaling. Detec-tion of an ovulation prior to that time delays breedinguntil a subsequent estrus period induced by prosta-glandin administered 5 days post examina-tion. Those mares with suitable follicles ( /H1102235 mm diameter), appropriate uterine involution, absence ofendometrial fluid or echogenicity suggestive of inflam-mation or from caudal repro-ductive tract pathologies (severe vaginitis, cervicitis,overt cervical defects, mural or mesometrial hemato-mas) are scheduled for breeding dictated by ongoingovarian, endometrial, and cervical progress. Thosemares requiring management of post-foaling trauma, infection, inflammation, or an elective waiting periodare managed accordingly. The value of serial ultra-sonography of post-foaling mares to detect and resolvepathology, and appropriately schedule for breeding,with respect to the economic outcome of achieving atimely pregnancy cannot be overstated. 6. Summary The immediate neonatal period is one of consider-able challenge to the foal as it adjusts to thedemands of extrauterine life. Examination atfoal heat is timely to assess musculoskeletal de-velopment, nutritional status, and the adequacy ofgrowth. Structures associated with fetal lifeshould have regressed, and major organ systemsassumed responsibility for sustaining the foal.The mare is capable of repeat breeding at this timeif involution has progressed favorably and ovarianactivity correctly timed. The demands of lactationnecessitate an adequate supply of nutrition, and thedental and gastrointestinal competence to use feedmaterial. Veterinary input at this time should en-sure both foal and mare have reached milestonescompatible with continued development toward ma-turity and potential for rebreeding, respectively. Appendix A.

Introduction The aged horse population represents a growing andunderserved patient base in equine veterinary prac-tice. In fact, in a recent survey of over 11,000 horseowners care of the senior horse was identied byowners as a major health issue of concern, secondonly to joint problems. 1Promotion of a healthy aging process should start when horses are in theirmiddle teen years through an owner-veterinariancollaboration designed to proactively identify andresolve problems before serious illness or physicalcompromise can develop. The key to keeping theold horse active and healthy is vigilant attentionand timely intervention to treat problems beforethey escalate into serious conditions. 2. Healthy Aging in Horses Aging is a ubiquitous process accompanied by a lossof adaptability to environmental stress or challenge.Several factors likely contribute to the loss of resil-iency in the aged, such as impaired regenerativecapacity, decreased metabolic efciency and accu-mulation of products of lifelong wear and tear.Whatever the cause, loss of resiliency in the agedcan contribute to increased susceptibility and se-verity of many types of conditions in the elderlyincluding inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, anddegenerative diseases. Therefore, early recogni- tion and intervention, or when possible, preventionof disease is a critical underpinning of geriatricmedicine. Establishing a healthcare program for the aging horse is a service an equine practice can provide forclients that is typically very well received. Resultsof a market research survey of more than 6000 horseowners suggested that owners consider geriatrichorse care to be an area of veterinary practice inwhich increasing client services would be desirable(http://touch.aaep.org/). The goal of an aging horse healthcare program is to extend the \"healthspan,\" as well as the life span ofthe equine patients. Currently more than half ofhorses over 15 years of age are still involved inphysical activity, and 25% of them are still compet-ing. 2Maximizing the number of performance years of a horse is smart both for sentimental and nan- cial reasons, given that the older horse representsyears of investment in training. Replacing a well-trained older horse is neither an easily accomplishednor inexpensive task. Programs that involve boththe client and veterinarian in a collaborative effortto monitor, record, diagnose, and treat problems asthey arise will have the best outcome for extendinghealthy years for the aging horse. It is important 464 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENT NOTESto recognize that often clients are unaware thattheir aged horses have medically manageable condi-tions; much is attributed to old age that is in factdisease. 3-4 3.

Several studies have been performed during the last10-15 years that have examined the medical prob-lems of aged horses. 3-8These studies have taken different approaches to gather data, such as ownersurveys, retrospective analysis of medical records,veterinary examination of randomly selected agedhorses, and postmortem examinations. They haveexamined horse populations residing in differentgeographic locations including on different conti-nents. Despite the differences in study design andlocation, the ndings were similar, with the types ofmedical problems reported and their relative fre-quency comparable among the studies. In addi-tion, it was a common nding that owners often didnot recognize medical problems in their old horses. 4. Common Medical Issues of the Old Horse Lameness is the number-one problem identied byowners and veterinarians in the healthy aged horsepopulation. It is also the number-one reason forloss of use and death. Common causes of lamenessin aged horses include osteoarthritis, laminitis, hoofproblems, and soft-tissue injuries. Weight loss is common and is typically multifac- torial in aged horses. Factors contributing toweight loss include dental abnormalities, impropernutrition, chronic pain, muscle topituitary pars mal-absorption, and parasitism. In some aged equidpopulations obesity may be more common than poorbody condition. Obesity may worsen other condi-tions, such as lameness, laminitis, and exerciseintolerance. Colic and gastrointestinal disorders, including esophageal choke occur commonly in aged horsesand are a frequent reason for owners of geriatrichorses to seek veterinary care. Impactions andesophageal choke are most commonly associatedwith poor dentition and/or improper feeding. Stran-gulating lesions due to lipomas or other causes arenot uncommon. Ophthalmic lesions including cataracts, vitreous degeneration, and senile retinopathy were diag-nosed in the majority of aged horses in several stud-ies of veterinary examination of aged horses.Although not a disease strictly limited to the olderhorse, equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is more com-mon in the older horses; between 25 and 33% ofhorses /H1102215 years of age will have signs consistent with ERU. Despite the frequency with which pa-thology is present in the eyes of old horses, loss ofvision is not commonly recognized by owners. Skin problems, including failure to shed, late shedding, or incomplete shedding, dermatophilis,and dermatological tumors are commonly recog- nized and reported by owners of aged horses. Shed-ding abnormalities and bacterial skin infections areoften secondary to PPID in aged horses, althoughthese clinical signs can also occur with severe debil-itation. Common skin tumors affecting the agedhorse include squamous cell carcinoma andmelanoma. Endocrine disease, most notably PPID, increases exponentially with age. PPID can cause a plethoraof clinical signs in old horses and can predisposeaffected animals to secondary diseases, such as in-fections, parasitism, and laminitis. Chronic respiratory diseases such as heaves in- crease in incidence and severity in the aged horse.Heart murmurs and arrhythmias are also more com-mon in older horses, with approximately 20% ofhorses /H1135015 years having detectable murmurs with /H1102240% of these graded /H113503/6. 4The most common cause of murmurs in aged horses is due to degener- ative valve disease of the mitral and aortic valves.9 Exercise intolerance and poor thermoregulation are also typical of the aged horse; typically, the olderthe horse the worse its exercise tolerance and ef-ciency of training. 10 Key Components to a Senior Horse Healthcare Program 1. Educate clients on problems and special needs of the aging horse. 2. Provide clients a plan for monitoring, record- ing, and reporting key health parameters. 3. Regularly schedule veterinary examinations.4. Routinely perform well-horse geriatric health screens. 5. Provide expertise in design of exercise and nu- trition routines. 6. Early interventions for identied problems.7. Discussion for end-of-life (euthanasia) plan. 5. Educate Clients on Problems and Special Needs of the Aging Horse Old Horses Benet From Enhanced Management and Optimized Care Old horses, similar to old people, are less able to adapt to environmental stress. Therefore, provid-ing good basic husbandry is a critical component inthe care of aged horses. Clients should be educatedregarding the special needs of aged horses, giventhat they may be unaware of some of the specicrequirements of a geriatric horse. For example,even an old horse that is no longer in work needstimely farrier care given that proper foot care canaid in ease of ambulation for the arthritic animal.Older horses do not thermoregulate as well asyounger animals. Therefore, in extreme hot or coldweather proper shelter is important and a longerwarm-up and cool-down period is needed with exer-cise. Typically, older horses are at the bottom ofthe herd hierarchy, so a safe place to eat and ade- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 465HOW-TO SESSION: LIFE time to nish meals is important. The horseis a social species and aged horses rely on theirpasture mates to feel safe from predators; therefore,a pasture companion is optimal. Older animalshave decreased ability to digest ber, impaired nu-trient absorption, and increased risk of impactions.Therefore, individualized appropriate feeding pro-grams, timely fecal egg counts (FEC), proper dentalcare, and ample access to adequate water is neces-sary. Water should be clean and may need to bewarm; ice cold water may not be well tolerated,especially in old horses with sore mouths. Considerproviding an educational event for your clients ongeneral management of the aged horse. You mighthost a seminar, provide an informational handout,direct them to an appropriate Web site or hold aquestion-and-answer session on a social mediaplatform. 6. Provide Clients a Plan for Monitoring, Recording and Reporting Key Health Parameters Engage clients in the monitoring of the aged horse'shealth. Give the client a mechanism to record thehorse's data; either a folder or notebook for the pa-per-oriented client or a jump drive or Web site forthe more electronically- oriented client. Sectionsthat can be included are below: 1. Preventative health records. Dates of vacci- nation and Coggins test. 2. Body weight and condition scores. a. Include directions with gures on how to body condition score (BCS) and how to mea-sure neck circumference. b. Provide a spreadsheet or table where clients can enter data for BCS, weight, and neckcircumference (Fig 1). c. Create periodic graphs to highlight trends (Fig 1). d. Have a place for digital images of the horse. e. Include cut-off values for when to call the veterinarian. 3. Laboratory data results.4. Date of shedding and pattern of shedding. Dated photos are useful to document patterns. 5. Time to consume a meal.6. Exercise data. a. Workout schedule.b. Time to recovery after exercise. 7. Farrier records including comments and photos of feet. 7. Regularly Scheduled Veterinary Examinations Geriatric Equine Wellness Examination Minimally, a geriatric wellness examination shouldbe performed yearly starting when a horse is 15years old. As the horse ages, the frequency of vet-erinary examinations should be increased to twice ayear due to the high incidence of age-related prob-lems that can be identied. Approach a geriatricwellness examination with the attention to detail of a pre-purchase examination. Remember, the goalis to identify occult problems, such as those de-scribed above (see Medical Conditions of the AgedHorse), that may respond to early interventions soclose scrutiny during the examination is important.Consider creating an Aged Horse Wellness Programat your practice to encourage clients to subscribe toa whole animal, preventative health approach spe-cically designed to optimize care of the aging horse. Plan the timing of the examination strategically. Consider trying to do the geriatric examinations inthe spring to allow the timing of spring shedding tobe evaluated and again in the fall when the plasmaendogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)test is most useful for identifying PPID. Schedule aFEC to coincide with maximum parasite emergence,which for most of the United States will be in thespring and/or fall. General Appearance Evaluation of body weight and condition at each visit is critical. A body-weight and a BCS should beperformed and recorded in the medical record atevery veterinary examination. Digital photos areextremely helpful as well. In addition, every ownershould be trained how to BCS and weight tape theiranimals. Monthly monitoring of this data by own-ers may help identify early health trends. Reviewthe owner's data at the veterinary visit and summa-rize it in your medical records. Consider graphingdata for better visualization of trends. It is impor-tant to bring the veterinary record with you to thefarm so that you can assess progression. Fig. 1. Using an excel spreadsheet, a simple graph can be cre-ated to help track weight change over time. 466 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTIt can be hard to accurately BCS an old horse. If that is the case, a written description of ndingsshould also be recorded. For example, an agedhorse may have fat pads at tailbase, a cresty neck,but also show atrophy of the topline with easilypalpated ribs. When averaged, the BCS may be a4/9, which, as a stand-alone entry is not as helpful asstating the specic anatomical ndings. Includeneck circumference measurements, especially if thehorse is regionally or generally obese.Lameness ExaminationWatch the horse move, examine the feet, and flex thejoints. In a study of 69 horses /H1135030 years of age, 100% of them had loss of range of motion of at leastone joint. 11More than half of horses 15 years or older were found to be 3/5 lame when examined by a veterinarian.4 Dental ExaminationA complete oral examination should be performed onall aged horses. Remember that many of the oldhorses will have a sore mouth from dental disease ordegenerative joint disease of the temporomandibu-lar joint, so sedation and analgesia may be neces-sary. Always use a speculum and a good lightsource to ensure a thorough examination. Beconservative when floating the teeth of agedhorses. You will not x a lifetime of dental ne-glect. Just make the mouth comfortable. Do notover le the teeth or you may worsen the problemif the occlusal grinding surface is disrupted. Re-move loose teeth. The goal of dentistry in theaged horse is improving comfort and the ability tomasticate feed. 12 IntegumentMake careful observation of shedding pattern andexamine closely for skin tumors and signs of derma-titis. Measure and record tumor size with calipers.Ophthalmologic ExaminationA full eye examination including a fundic examina-tion should be performed.Heart and LungsAuscult the horse in a quiet location. Use of are-breathing bag is recommended. If the horse isstill used for performance or pleasure riding, a car-diopulmonary examination focused on recovery afterexercise can be informative. 8. Routine Well-Horse Geriatric Health Screens A well-horse geriatric health screen plasma ACTH concentration, and a quantitative FEC. A fasting or restinginsulin or an oral sugar test is advisable in horsesthat are overweight, have a history of laminitis, orPPID. Establishing an individual horse's normalreference interval is ideal. By starting geriatrichealth screens when the horse is in their mid to late teens, this can usually be accomplished. Normalreference intervals for aged horses are generallysimilar to that of younger animals; however, whenill, it is common for aged horses to have a mild butsignicantly greater deviation in their biochemistryvalues compared with ill younger horses. 6 9. Provide Expertise in Design of Exercise and Nutrition Routines Counsel your clients on the importance of exercise and proper nutrition in horses as they age. Theoverall goal is to maintain an ideal body condition, and keep the aged horse active to optimize flexibil-ity, muscle tone, and strength. As horses age,both exercise and nutritional requirements willchange. 13-14Therefore, it is advisable to reassess your recommendations at each visit. A common example is the horse that has been obese as an adultand is managed on a diet designed to limit caloriesand minimize water-soluble carbohydrates. Asthis horse grows older it may experience an age-associated change in metabolic and endocrine func-tion and start to lose weight. This weight loss canprogress rather rapidly, resulting in an overly thinanimal if adjustments are not made in a timelymanner. In the thin, aged horse it is important to provide a safe environment to allow ample access to feed.Typically, older horses drop in hierarchal positionwithin the herd, and as a result access to hay orgrain will be limited if asked to compete withyounger herdmates. Furthermore, the time re-quired to consume a concentrate meal is frequentlymuch longer, causing the older horse to be run offbefore nishing. Feeding processed or complete se-nior feeds have been shown to be benecial in pro-moting weight gain in thin aged horses. For thosewith poor dentition or a history of esophageal ob-struction, presoaking the feed is advised. In the obese aged horse, measures should be taken to reduce BCS through limiting caloric intake andreducing water-soluble carbohydrates in the diet,in a similar manner to weight loss in the youngeranimal. Providing mineral and trace supple-ments, particularly if hay is being soaked, is es-pecially important in the older animal as nutrientabsorption can be impaired with age. 10. Early Interventions for Identied Problems The overall goal of a geriatric horse program is to bevigilant in observing the horse so that timely inter-ventions can be successful in preventing serioushealth issues from developing. Therefore, it is im-portant that criteria are communicated to clients asto what constitutes a problem and when to schedulea veterinary visit. Having \"call ifs\" on the owner'slogs and medical records can be helpful. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 467HOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENT11. Discussion for End-of-Life (Euthanasia) Plan Euthanasia More than 90% of horses are euthanized rather thandie of natural causes. 15Therefore, it is advisable to have a discussion with the client to help develop anend-of-life plan for the geriatric horse. Most impor-tant is having a plan in place on how the horse'sremains will be handled and who will be present atthe euthanasia. It is preferable to have this discus-sion prior to the actual time when the horse is introuble and actions are needed. For a client, a eu-thanasia experience is often one of the most impor-tant determinates of how favorably they view aveterinarian. Hospice or Palliative Care Hospice or palliative care is a service that can beoffered to help manage the horse that has a verylimited time left before euthanasia or death. Thegoal is to help the terminal patient remain comfort-able for a nite period to allow the horse ownerpreparation time for the euthanasia. Most oftenthis involves management of pain or loss of mobilityor appetite. It is important that the expectationsfrom both the owner and veterinarian be clearlystated, given that management of pain may be dif-ferent in the animal expected to live for a year oryears compared with one being euthanized in 2 days.

Introduction Drug resistance among cyathostomin and ascaridpopulations is a growing concern for horse opera-tions worldwide. The fact that Cyathostomina are not usually serious pathogens in well-managed,healthy adult horses has allowed practitioners andhorse owners to remain fairly complacent that suchresistance, although warranting caution, was man-ageable. That comfort level disappeared with re- ports of drug-resistant populations of Parascaris equorum in young horses. 1-7During the rst year of life, the most pathogenic parasite encountered byyoung horses remains P. equorum with its potential to cause respiratory disease, ill thrift, weight loss,small-intestinal impaction, peritonitis, and death.Effective control of P. equorum should be the litmus test for a successful deworming program designedfor juvenile horses. Management practices associ-ated with the appearance of drug-resistant ascaridsinclude a farm history of frequent anthelmintictreatments that begin when foals are younger than 2months of age and are repeated at regular, frequentintervals without regard to basic parasite biology oranthelmintic susceptibilities. 1-8The environmental longevity of weather-resistant P. equorum eggs con-tributes to progressive accumulation, year after year, of drug-resistant eggs on mare and foal pas-tures, resulting in a vicious cycle of the currentyear's foal crop becoming infected through ingestionof ascarid eggs shed by past generations of wean-lings. Without the use of fecal-egg-count reductiontests (FECRTs) to efcacy of frequentlyused dewormers, many breeding farms unknowinglyhave been selecting for the survival of drug-resistant ascarid populations through frequent and repetitiveuse of drugs that are no longer effective. Resultsfrom surveys conducted among stud-farm managersfrom different countries conrm that despite ac-knowledging the growing prevalence of drug-resis-tant ascarids, farm managers continue to rely ontraditional, intensive, rotational deworming regi-mens that rarely employ fecal egg counts (FECs) orveterinarian consultation. Although ascarid infec-tions seem to eclipse the importance of other equineparasites, threadworms, small and large strongyles,pinworms, and tapeworms also must be consideredwhen designing a deworming protocol for older foalsand weanlings. In the United States, the over-the-counter avail- ability of all major classes of dewormers favors an AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 469HOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENT NOTESincreased reliance on chemical control of parasiteswith less focus on nonchemical management strate-gies. The widespread frequent use of anthelmint-ics, often in the absence of any fecal surveillanceprogram or veterinary involvement, has contributedto the development of multidrug-resistant isolates inwell-cared-for horse populations of all ages. Thereare numerous reports of conrmed or suspected re-sistance in small disconcerting are reports of cyathostomins and ascarids becoming resistant to more than one drug class.3,4,21Fortunately, there still are no published reports of drug resistanceamong cestodes and large strongyle species includ-ingStrongylus vulgaris. The design and implementation of an effective parasite control program for young horse popula-tions faces several inescapable but surmountableobstacles. Juvenile horses have a long-recognized,age-related, increased susceptibility to parasite in-fection and clinical disease as well as a notoriouspropensity for a decreased response to anthelmintictherapy accompanied by shortened egg reappear-ance periods (ERPs). 22In addition, many breeding operations are challenged by the following: A high stocking density that limits pasture management options available to control sea-sonal pasture contamination with parasiteeggs and larvae. An \"open herd\" with frequent introduction of new mares and foals harboring unknownprepatent parasite burdens with unknowndrug sensitivities. A long history of intensive deworming prac- tices for foals and weanlings with treatmentscommencing at unusually young age fol-lowed by short, frequent deworming intervals,often complicated by repetitive administrationof the same class of anthelmintics without ben-et of FEC monitoring to verify drug efcacy. An understandable reluctance of farm man- agement to deviate from traditional deworm-ing practices that have been followed for years,if not decades. Economic restraints that mandate any pro- posed FEC-based surveillance program mustbe cost conscious in terms of labor and diag-nostic expenses. Without the promise of any new, resistance-break- ing class of dewormer for horses in the near future,it is crucial to prolong the efcacy of the three majordrug classes we do have by encouraging horse own-ers to rely on veterinary advice and properly timedfecals to customize their deworming protocols ratherthan defaulting to frequent, random administrationof anthelmintics. Fecal egg counts, although ac-cepted as an important part of an evidence-basedparasite control program, are unlikely to become widely accepted if they are too expensive or offeredonly as random diagnostic assays. The challengefor veterinarians is to offer (and charge for) a com-prehensive parasite control program that incorpo-rates FECs into a farm-wide, herd-based programthat combines chemical and nonchemical controlstrategies. 2. Materials and Methods Designing a parasite control program for younghorses that includes fecal assays and veterinaryoversight requires an appreciation of managementfactors that select for resistance, a working knowl-edge of parasite and drug interactions, and an un-derstanding of how to use FECs and FECRTs tomonitor drug efcacy and customize a dewormingprogram. A brief summary of several recent para-site surveillance trials and surveys will help identifyprevailing trends in parasite control practices on avariety of breeding operations. A review of the keyparasite life cycles, the mode of action, and efcacyof the three major classes of equine anthelminticsand the advantages of various fecal egg countingmethods available will round out the informationinfrastructure needed to empower veterinarians tofeel comfortable providing a more comprehensiveapproach to parasite control. Given that an in-depth discussion of parasite bi- ology and anthelmintic resistance is beyond thescope of this article, the reader is referred to otherexcellent review articles and books 23-26as well as the current and comprehensive set of guidelines for equine parasite control strategies available on theAmerican Association of Equine Practitioners Website (www.aaep.org/custdocs/AAEP Parasite ControlGuidelines.pdf). 27 3. Results Independent surveys conducted among stud farmmanagers in the United Kingdom, Germany, NewZealand, Australia, and Kentucky 3,28-32revealed similarities in deworming strategies and attitudes about parasite control. The majority of stud farmsstill relied upon xed, interval-based treatments forfoals and weanlings. Most farms dewormed young-sters an average of six to eight times a year. In aKentucky-based survey, greater than 80% of Thor-oughbred breeding farms reported using rotationaldeworming for their young horses with little to nofecal surveillance. 29On most of those same farms the rst deworming treatments were begun before foals were 8 weeks of age, with many operationsadministering the rst dewormer when youngsterswere only 4 weeks old. Among European studfarms, an ML-containing anthelmintic, namely iver-mectin, was the most popular drug class used inyoung horses and was often used repetitively dur-ing the rst year of life. Tetrahydropyrimidinestended to be the second most commonly used prod- uct. Among Kentucky Thoroughbred farms the 470 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE betweenthe benzimidazoles, pyrantel pamoate, and ivermec-tin. A recent survey of eight Thoroughbred andStandardbred breeding operations in New SouthWales, Australia revealed that most foals receivedtheir rst anthelmintic between 4 and 6 weeks ofage even though FECs documented that patent as-carid infections were most common in foals 3 monthsof age or older. 3Among breeding farms surveyed, ascarid resistance to ivermectin was most common, followed by reduced susceptibility to pyrantel. Inthe Australian surveillance trial, reduced suscepti-bility of ascarids to fenbendazole was also identied.Drug efcacy often varied between stud farms andregions within each country, which reinforces theimportance of evaluating drug resistance patternson a farm-by-farm basis. Unfortunately, the major-ity of breeding operations surveyed reported a gen-eral lack of reliance on FECs and FECRTs toformulate deworming or to determinewhich ascaridsand strongyles. Few farms had deworming proto-cols or quarantine procedures for newly arrivedmares and foals. Certain pasture managementstrategies were more universally accepted whereasother practices varied by region. Rotational graz-ing was used to varying degrees by the majority ofstud farms surveyed, whereas the use of mixed-species grazing of pastures with cattle or sheep wasmore likely to occur in Europe or New Zealand asopposed to Kentucky. All farms used mowing ofroughs, harrowing of elds, and removal of feces tosome degree, but the frequency of those practicesvaried greatly. In Germany, foals on farms fertil-izing pastures with horse manure had a signi-cantly higher risk of having patent P. equorum infections. 32When asked how parasite-related ill - ness was recognized, respondents listed unex-plained episodes of colic, observation of parasites inmanure, unexplained loss of condition, or theirveterinarian's opinion. Despite expressing anawareness of drug-resistant parasites, stud farmmanagers in Kentucky were only willing to spendmore time and money on an FEC surveillance-basedapproach to parasite control if they could be con-vinced that doing so would prevent anthelminticresistance and decrease documented parasite-related health risks for their horses. 29 Collectively, these surveys concluded that tradi- tional approaches to deworming young horses wereunlikely to be replaced by an FEC-based dewormingstrategy unless veterinarians could convince farmmanagers of the tangible benets such a programwould have on the health of the individual, the herd,and the farm environment. With that challenge inmind, it is helpful to review the basic life cycles andprepatent periods of key equine parasites, mode ofaction, and label claims of the major drug classes,FEC assays available, and the value of ERP andfecal egg reduction testing to evaluate the efcacy ofa deworming protocol.Foals and weanlings are likely to encounter some or all of the following parasites during the in the life cycles of these parasites arepresented in Table 1. A few additional commentsare warranted regarding Strongyloides westeri and P. equorum given that deworming reg- imens target very young foals, often unnecessar-ily, due to a fear of these two parasites. Strongyloides westeri , residing as an adult in the small intestine, is the rst nematode to mature infoals with a prepatent period of less than 2 weeks(sometimes as short as 5-7 d). Infective third-stagelarvae (L3) can be transmitted to foals via theirdam's milk for up to 40 days postpartum. 33Foals can also acquire S westeri infections from the envi- ronment via oral or percutaneous routes. Larvaeundergo pulmonary migration followed by a returnto the small intestines where the females embed inthe intestinal mucosa. Foals with clinical strongy-loidosis may exhibit anorexia, lethargy, and diar-rhea. This nematode is usually considered benignunless present in large numbers as supported byobservations from eld cases that suggest clinicalsigns of diarrhea are associated with high FECs ( /H11022 2000 eggs per gram [EPG]). 34Interestingly, the prevalence of patent S. westeri infections among Thoroughbred foals in Kentucky has waxed andwaned during the past several decades, with a muchhigher incidence of patent infections reported priorto the approval of ivermectin for use in horses.A recent study of foals ranging in ages from 17 to117 days of age that had never been dewormed re-vealed a prevalence rate of 30% for patent S. westeri infections, which was substantially greater thanhistorical reports from the same geographic areaapproximately 15 years earlier. 35-37It was hypoth - esized that this recent increase in S. westeri -posi- tive fecals among Kentucky foals was related to thediminished use of ivermectin in response to the in-creased prevalence of ML-resistant populations of P. equorum. The changing prevalence rate for S. wes- teri infection in foals serves as a reminder that changing the use of a single drug class to addressresistance among one parasite species may haveconsequences in terms of other parasitic infections.Less-frequent use of ivermectin may help combat theincrease of drug-resistant ascarid populations whilepotentially ML-sen-sitive nematodes. Thankfully, age-related immunitytoS. westeri infection is expected to develop in foals by the time they are 4 to 5 months of age.

Strategic deworming of the mare may help alleviate the pervasive fear of S. westeri that still prompts some farms to routinely deworm foals be-ginning at 2 to 4 weeks of age. P. equorum infection is most common in foals and young horses less than 2 years of age. Immunitytypically develops by the time youngsters are 8 to 18months of age and is believed to be age-related andexposure induced. Following ingestion of larvatedeggs from pasture, paddocks, dry lots, or stalls, lar-vae emerge in the small-intestinal lumen, penetratethe intestinal mucosa, enter the lymphatics, and aretransported to the liver. After a period of hepaticmigration lasting as long as one week, L3s are car-ried to the lungs via the posterior vena cava. Lar-vae erupt from pulmonary capillaries to enter thealveoli. After 2-3 weeks of pulmonary migration,larvae are coughed up, swallowed, and continue theremainder of their development in the small-intes-tinal lumen. The prepatent period is approxi-mately 10-15 weeks. Clinical signs associatedwith pulmonary migration include purulent nasaldischarge, cough, and mild fever. 39-41Large bur - dens of ascarid larvae and adults within the smallintestine have been associated poor growth,weight loss, unthrifty appearance, inappetance, anddiarrhea. Small-intestinal impaction resulting incolic and occasionally bowel rupture peritonitisdoes occur and is often temporally associated withrecent deworming using a ML or pyrimidine anthel-mintic. 42-44If surgical intervention is required to relieve ascarid impactions, the outcome is oftenguarded due con - sidered the most vulnerable population fordeveloping clinical respiratory and gastrointestinalsigns associated with P. equorum infections, farm managers should be warned that respiratory diseasecan occur in susceptible yearlings infected in P. equorum 39and surgical colic secondary to ascaridimpactions have been reported in youngsters one year of age and older.44Ascarid eggs, once passed, become infective within two weeks under favorable environmental conditions. Consequently, biweeklymanure removal in mare and foal pastures is highlyeffective in reducing environmental exposure. Oncelarvated, P. equorum eggs are extremely resistant and can withstand extremes in environmental tempera-tures resulting in pasture persistence for 5 to 10 years.Interestingly, a well-maintained composting systemcan attain high enough temperatures to render P. equorum eggs nonviable. 45-46Cross-species grazing of pastures with either sheep or cattle is another nonchemical control strategy used to reduce pastureegg burdens. Drugs commonly used in young foals (age /H113496 mo) to treat P. equorum infections oxibendazole, pyrantel, and ivermectin. The drugdosages and ascarid life stages affected are listed inTable 2. When selecting an anthelmintic to controlP. equorum it is important to distinguish which drugs are adulticides vs larvicides to establish real-istic expectations of ERPs following treatment.Larvicidal drugs, if still effective, should be capableof suppressing P. equorum egg shedding for a sub- stantially longer time period than adulticides, giventhat the former drugs eliminate both migrating lar-val stages as well as egg-laying adults in the intes-tines. Based on the life cycle of the parasite, thetime interval for foals to become reinfected and re-establish a patent infection could be as long as10-12 weeks following treatment with a larvicide.Adulticides, such as pyrantel pamoate, which onlyeliminate adult ascarids in the intestines, would beexpected to have a shorter ERP given that larvalstages unaffected by the dewormer will continue tomature into egg-laying adults in a much shortertime period ( /H113494-5 wk). If respiratory disease is suspected as a result of pulmonary inflammationinduced by P. equorum migration, then a larvicidal treatment would be indicated. In young foals, iver-mectin is the only anthelmintic with a label larvae.

Understanding the mode of action and spectrum of activity of the three major classes of anthelmintics,benzimidazoles, tetrahydropyrimidines, and MLsenables practitioners to leverage the full potential ofeach drug class. The mode of action of benzimidazole anthelmint- ics (e.g., fenbendazole, oxibendazole) is to disruptparasite energy metabolism at a cellular level.Time to kill susceptible parasites is generally slowerthan that of other drug classes. These dewormersprovide a broad spectrum of efcacy against largestrongyles, cyathostomins, Parascaris and Oxyuris infections. Oxibendazole westeri when administered at 15 mg/kg. Fen- bendazole administered at an elevated dose of 10mg/kg for 5 consecutive days exhibits larvicidal ef-cacy against migrating strongyles and suscep-tible populations of migrating and encysted smallstrongyles. Although not part of the label claim,the larvicidal fenbendazole has larvae. 47,48Larvicidal treatment with fenbendazole has been suggested asa possible tool for preventing the inadvertent intro-duction of resistant ascarid isolates by foals arrivingfrom other farms. 8This treatment also has been shown to suppress ascarid egg shedding for at least 8 weeks post treatment.4Although benzimidazoles may be the optimal drug class to control P. equorum infections, reports of benzimidazole resistant cya-thostomin populations 10-15suggest that other drug classes might be better suited for control of drug- resistant small strongyle infections in older, post-weaning-age foals. Pyrimidine anthelmintics are marketed for horses in North America as pyrantel pamoate, available inpaste or suspension formulations and as pyranteltartrate, available as a pelleted formulation de-signed to be used as a daily feed additive. Themode of action for these drugs is as selective acetyl-choline agonists resulting in rapid, spastic paralysisof susceptible worms that are then usually expelledby intestinal peristalsis. Given that there is nointestinal absorption of the pyrimidine anthelmint-ics, their effect is conned to only luminal stages ofparasites and does not include larvalstages. Lack of with efcacy againstcyathostomins, pinworms. label dose of provide at least 80% ces-tocidal efcacy 50and administration of twice that dose (13.2 mg/kg) affords greater than 95% efcacy against tapeworms.51Conrmed and suspected cyathostomin resistance to pyrimidine dewormers has been reported in numerous countries world-wide. 16-18,52Although the pyrimidines are usually considered to be effective against P. equorum infec- tions,5,6,8there are a growing number of reports of pyrantel-resistant ascarid populations.4Some re - searchers have demonstrated that administeringpyrantel pamoate at a higher dose of 13.2 mg/kgdemonstrates good efcacy against drug-resistant P. equorum populations. 4,53 The ML drug class contains two subgroups: the avermectins and milbemycins. Both drugs causeneuromuscular flaccid paralysis in susceptible par-asites by interfering with the function of glutamate-gated chloride channels found only in neurons andmyocytes of invertebrates. Affected parasites canno longer ingest nutrients and die of starvation orare expelled by intestinal peristalsis if they are re-siding within the gut lumen at the time of treat-ment. Similar to the pyrimidines, onset of action israpid and occurs within 48 hours following treat-ment. Both ivermectin and moxidectin have broadparasiticidal activities and are effective against lu-minal stages of nematodes as well as migrating lar-val stages ascarids, large strongyles, andStrongyloides . In nematodes, these drugs also exhibit efcacy against arthropods andare useful in the treatment of Gasterophilus larvae. Drugs in this class are also effective chocerca larvae, Habronema accumulation in fatty tissues, be-comes highly concentrated in serum when it is admin-istered to horses with very little body fat, such as foalsor thin, debilitated individuals. The immature bloodbrain barrier of young foals renders them more sus-ceptible to moxidectin toxicity. Signs associated withtoxicity include dyspnea, depression, weakness,ataxia, coma, and seizures. 54,55In the United States, moxidectin is not labeled for use in foals less than 6 months of age. Provided the ascarid population on a given farm is not ML resistant, ivermectin exhibits good efcacyagainst P. equorum larval and adult stages. How- ever, experience that moxidectin will be in-effective in clearing ascarid infections in older wean-lings and yearlings on the same farm. Macrocycliclactones continue to demonstrate good efcacyagainst cyathostomins at 14 days post-treatmentand large strongyles remain susceptible. However,there are reports of the strongyle ERP becoming 474 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTshorter after treatment with both compounds in thisdrug class. When rst marketed, ivermectin andmoxidectin suppressed strongyle egg shedding for 8weeks and 12-16 weeks, respectively. Recent re-ports have documented reduced ERPs of less than 5weeks for ML anthelmintics. 7,19Additional studies have demonstrated that L4 small strongyle larvae residing in the intestinal lumen are able to survivetreatment with MLs. 15 The two most popular fecal egg counting tech- niques are the modied Wisconsin method, thatinvolves centrifugation and flotation using a Sheath-er's sugar solution and can detect egg counts as lowas 1-5 EPG; and the McMasters technique, whichrelies on flotation using one of several solutions (e.g.,saturated salt, saturated sugar-salt, ZnSO 4,o r Sheather's sugar) and the use of a calibrated count- ing chamber, and has a lower limit of detection of /H11350 25-50 EPG. The modied Wisconsin method offersan increased likelihood of observing cestode eggs ifpresent and is the preferred method to use whenperforming a FECRT due to its low egg detectionlimit. Fecal samples collected for either methodshould be as fresh as possible and stored in airtightbags or containers to reduce egg hatching. If refrig-erated, fecal samples can be stored for at least 5-7days. The reader is referred to other references fordetails regarding sample handling and storage aswell as detailed testing procedures. 26 The FECRT is the only method currently avail- able to determine whether anthelmintic resistanceis developing. Originally designed to evaluate re-sistance among strongyle species, the FECRT hasalso been applied to ascarids, although results should be interpreted cautiously. To perform a FECRT, afecal sample is collected prior to deworming and 10-14days following treatment. The numbers of EPGs inthe pre- and post-treatment samples are used to cal-culate the percent reduction can be used for each horse individually,but in the interest of economics and labor, it is oftensufcient to test groups of individuals previouslyidentied as moderate to high shedders. TheFECR values obtained from those groups are used toinfer drug efcacy for the farm. Horses should nothave received anthelmintic treatments for at least 8-10 weeks prior to performing the FECRT. Ifmoxidectin was the last drug administered it is pref-erable to wait at least 12-14 weeks before collectinga pretreatment sample. The FECRT can also beused to screen newcomers arriving on the farm.Only foals old enough to be shedding parasite eggsshould be included in the screening. Shedding of(small) strongyle eggs typically does not commenceuntil foals are 6 weeks of age or older and ascarideggs usually do not develop in fecals until foals areat least 8-12 weeks of age. Egg-counting tech-niques with greater sensitivity should be used tocalculate FECR and only animals with high-enoughpretreatment egg counts (e.g., /H11350100 EPG) should be included. Given that variability among individualanimals can be quite extreme, FECR should be de-termined for at least ve to 10 animals within afarm population and then the average FECR calcu-lated for the group tested. Guidelines for interpret-ing FECRT results are presented in Table 3. It isimportant to recognize that efcacies differ amongthe various anthelmintics. The values presented inTable 3 are suggested cutoff values to use to decidewhether parasites are still susceptible to a givendrug if there is evidence of developing resistance orif widespread resistance exists. ERP is dened as the time interval between the last effective deworming treatment and the resump-tion of signicant egg shedding. Table 4 lists theERP for commonly used equine dewormers. Occa-sional monitoring of the ERP for a given drug classon a farm is a reasonable way to determine whetherresistance is beginning to develop against drugs pre-viously considered effective. A shortening of theERP is considered a precursor to the development ofTable 3.

When monitoring the ERP it is onlynecessary to collect fecals from a subset of the resi-dent population (often the horses classied as higheregg shedders). As an example, if ivermectin waslast used, the expected ERP is 6-8 weeks. Collect-ing fecals from a group of young horses 4 weeks afterivermectin treatment will help determine whetherthe drug is still suppressing strongyle egg counts aslong as expected. 4. Discussion Despite the increasing prevalence of drug resistantP. equorum populations on breeding farms world- wide, deworming programs for young horses haveundergone minimal changes during the past sev-eral decades. Contemporary surveys of stud farmmanagers suggest that some of the reluctance to modify traditional, often intensive, interval-baseddeworming protocols is due to their uncertainty thatadopting a more comprehensive, surveillance-basedapproach to parasite control with a focus on P. equo- rum will result in tangible, measureable benets for the farm. Conditions are ideal for veterinarians tomarket their knowledge as well as diagnostic fecalassays. Continue to enlighten stud farm managersand foal owners about the health clinical and even subclinical P. equorum infec- tions. Without proper diagnostics, including FEC,upper respiratory tract disease secondary to ascaridlarval migration could easily be mistaken by laypersonnel for viral or bacterial infections. Foalsexperiencing chronic, ascarid-induced pulmonaryinflammation might be more susceptible to otheropportunistic respiratory pathogens. Suboptimalgrowth and poor body condition among weanlingsmay not be nutritional in origin but the results of P. equorum infection. The well-known threat of as- carid-induced impaction colic affects not only wean-lings, but has been reported in yearlings and youngadults as well. These potential health risks mayhelp convince foal owners and breeding farm man-agers to invest in an FEC surveillance program toensure their deworming program is effectively con-trolling indigenous P. equorum populations. Before making any deworming recommendations, consider providing a physical examination of indi-vidual farms using a simple questionnaire to cap-ture information about management practices, herddemographics, and deworming history. Assess thefarm in terms of stocking density, size, and overallcondition of pastures/paddocks and labor availableto help decide which nonchemical parasite controlstrategies are realistic and feasible for that particu-lar operation. Obtain a detailed history about an-thelmintic use spanning at least the past 3-5 yearswith a focus on when foals receive their rst de-wormer, the frequency of treatments, and whichdrug classes are routinely administered during therst year of life. Summarize results of any fecalsthat have been performed. Document if there havebeen any suspected or conrmed cases of parasite- related disease in foals, weanlings, or yearlings. Using information obtained during the farm visit, customize a parasite control plan that begins withstrategies to reduce environmental parasite egg andlarvae burdens. These husbandry options includecross-grazing pastures with other ruminant species,keeping pastures mowed to remove roughs, harvest-ing a hay crop at the end of the grazing season, andresting pastures for at least several months duringperiods of warm ambient temperatures sustainedabove 85\u00b0F to optimize dessication of vulnerablestrongyle larvae. If pastures are harrowed, remindowners that this procedure should only be performedduring hot, dry periods and pastures rested for 3-4weeks or longer before reintroducing mares andfoals. Bi-weekly manure removal from favoriteloang areas for mares and foals such as aroundrun-in sheds or near gates and waterers remains oneof the most effective methods to reduce exposure toinfective larval stages. Although fresh manureshould never be spread on active pastures, properlycomposted manure can attain high-enough temper-atures ascarideggs. 46If possible, foals and weanlings should be turned out onto the farm's cleanest pastures. Before a deworming protocol can be designed it is necessary to determine which drug classes are effec-tive against ascarids and cyathostomins on that par-ticular farm. Prior to weaning, focus on control ofP. equorum . In the older weanling control of small and large strongyles and tapeworms must be consid-ered. Begin with an easy-to-implement FEC sur-veillance program that is economical and laborfriendly in terms of sample collection. Agree onbasic guidelines for the program. One commongoal is to protect the health of the individual foal orweanling while simultaneously minimizing eggshedding using the fewest number of drug treat-ments possible. Unless medically indicated, delaythe rst anthelmintic treatment for foals until theyare 2-3 months of age. Reasons to consider ther-apy at a younger age include treatment of conrmed,clinically symptomatic S. westeri infections or clini- cal suspicion that are harboring to deworming foals younger than8 of age, consider screening a group of 2-6week-old foals to demonstrate the lack of any signif-icant fecal egg shedding prior to 8-10 weeks of age.These results reinforce the time required for ascaridand cyathostomin infections to achieve patency andmay help farm managers feel more comfortableabout pushing back the age for rst drug treatmentswithout worrying about foals contaminating pas-tures with high egg counts. If fear of S. westeri is a reason for early drug treatments, re-examine thedeworming strategies for the periparturient mare todeflect unnecessary drug treatments away fromyoung foals. Ivermectin administered the monthbefore foaling or within the rst couple of days post- 476 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTpartum remains a popular drug choice. Oxibenda-zole administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg is areasonable treatment for foals with clinically signif-icant and symptomatic S. westeri infections. To determine which of the three major drug classes, (e.g., benzimidazoles, tetrahydropyrimi-dines, and MLs) are still effective against P. equo- rum, perform a FECRT on samples from foals with patent ascarid infections (e.g., positive FECs). Tomaximize efcient use of labor, the timing of thesefecal collections can coincide with a farm visit toscreen foals for Rhodococcus equi pneumonia or to administer vaccines or check mares for pregnancy.The fecal assay used should be reasonably pricedand sensitive. Consider training a technician toperform the FEC in house to reduce overhead andcost to the client while generating a modest prot.When performing FECR calculations to evaluatedrug efcacy, the author prefers the modied Wis-consin method due to its low egg detection limit.This method also increases the likelihood of detect-ing cestode eggs. If ivermectin resistance is and fenbendazole or oxibendazole are theremaining drug classes to consider. On some farmsusing the higher dosage (13.2 mg/kg) for pyrantelpamoate improved efcacy against resistant as-carids. 4,53Likewise, there are two different dos - ages to consider when administering fenbendazoleto juvenile horses. A dose of 10 mg/kg is recom-mended for youngsters less than 18 months of age.If ascarid resistance is detected at this dose, a lar-vicidal dose (e.g., 10 mg/kg administered once dailyfor 5 d) should be considered based on the reports ofefcacy against both larval and adult stages of P. equorum . 47,48It has been the author's experience that the larvicidal dose of fenbendazole has been effective at reducing P. equorum egg shedding when the single 10-mg/kg dose has proven unsatisfactory.Hopefully adequate ascarid control can be achievedwith two effective drug treatments administeredprior to weaning. On farms with open herds, eval-uate quarantine procedures for newly arrived foalsand leverage the use of a larvicidal treatment withfenbendazole coupled with a FEC to reduce the riskof introducing drug-resistant ascarids. Close toweaning time, consider evaluating FEC in a repre-sentative group of foals as a screening tool to seewhether the pre-weaning drug treatments targetingP. equorum have been successful. Among older weanlings, collect fecals from a rep- resentative group just prior to the next planned drugtreatment. Use the FEC results to identify foalswith patent strongyle infections that can be used totest drug efcacy against that group of parasites.The same three drug classes should be tested usingthe FECRT. Although there are numerous reportsof benzimidazole-resistant cyathostomins, do not as-sume resistance is present until it is conrmed onthat particular farm. Recent surveillance trials us-ing FECRT have shown that drug-resistance pat- terns can vary between facilities within the samestate. 4,58In some instances older weanlings may be shedding both ascarid and strongyle eggs and a sin- gle drug class might not be sufcient to control bothnematodes. In this situation consider adminis-tering two different drug classes simultaneously.This strategy has been used successfully on farmswith conrmed multidrug-resistant parasite popula-tions. 4If tapeworm infection is a concern, then one treatment administered between 6 and 12 months of age should include an effective cestocide such as thehigher dose of pyrantel pamoate or dewormer con-taining praziquantel. On larger breeding operations it might be possible to evaluate the efcacy of all three drug classeswithin one breeding season, given that differentgroups of foals can be used to test different anthel-mintics. On smaller operations with fewer foals, itwill probably require several foal seasons to test allthe drug classes against both ascarid and strongylepopulations. It is helpful to remember that not ev-ery foal needs to be tested every time. If drug-resistant parasites are detected it is likely to be afarm-wide problem rather than an individual ani-mal problem. Although this article has focused on the foal and weanling, it is na\u00efve to forget that broodmares rep-resent an important and intimate source of parasiteexposure for their foals through nematode eggs andlarvae shed in their feces or through their milk.An effective deworming program for the broodmareband helps control overall pasture parasite burdensawaiting each new crop of foals. 5. Summary Deworming protocols for young horses during theirrst year of life have three major goals: preventand/or decrease the incidence of parasite-related dis-ease in individual animals, reduce environmentalcontamination with parasite eggs and larvae, andaccomplish the rst two goals using the minimalnumber of effective drug treatments. Administra-tion of ivermectin to the periparturient mare shouldeliminate the urge to treat neonatal foals due to afear of S. westeri. Prior to weaning, P. equorum is the primary pathogen of concern and should be thefocus of anthelmintic treatments in foals 6 months ofage and younger. Ideally, foals should receive theirrst treatment just as ascarid infections achievepatency at approximately 2.5-3 months of age.Benzimidazoles and tetrahydropyrimidines are thetwo drug classes most likely to demonstrate efcacyagainst ascarids. Ivermectin should only be used ifefcacy is conrmed using the FECRT. Each drugclass should be evaluated periodically on a farm byfarm basis to ensure lack of resistance. After wean-ing, control of small and large strongyles and tape-worms become a consideration in drug selection.Macrocyclic lactones are a reasonable option forstrongyle control. Praziquantel or a double dose of AAEP 62 /H114082016 477HOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTpyrantel pamoate are the only choices for cestodetreatment. Figure 1 outlines a chronological ap-proach to parasite control during the rst year oflife. Strategic use of affordable and sensitive FECs to provide farm-specic deworming guidelinescombined with the implementation of realisticnonchemical parasite control strategies are criticalto the success of any deworming program and can bean important, billable veterinary service. Thiscomprehensive approach can be expanded to includeother age groups on the farm.

Introduction During the past century, improvements in healthcare and advancements in science and medicinehave extended the average life span of humans andcompanion animals, including horses. We are nowfacing new challenges with the paradox of an olderhorse population with increased longevity and thepotential of increased age-associated diseases. Thus,a better understanding of the mechanisms leadingto a decline in physiologic function with age is im-portant in providing optimal care of old horses.The process of aging is a ubiquitous complex phe-nomenon and although there is no universal deni-tion of aging, the effectiveness of severalphysiological systems becomes compromised. Oneof the most-recognized consequences of aging is adecline in function of the immune system. Thisintroduction will start by discussing the prevalenceof old horses, followed by conditions of the agedhorse. It will then go on to discuss the two mainterms that dene a declining immune system of theold horse: immunosenescence and inflamm-aging.Lastly, we will mention how nutrition may affect theimmune system of old horse. Denition and Prevalence of the \"Old\" Horse When does a horse become \"old?\" The term \"old\"has a broad meaning of \"lived for many years; notyoung.\" Some refer to the \"old\" as being \"geriatric\" or \"aged,\" which implies there are health problemsoccurring with the process of aging. However,there is considerable variation in the aging processand there is no set chronological age at which anindividual is considered \"old.\" This is due to thefact that chronological age does not equal biologicalage. Chronological age is simply an individual'sage in years. Biological age is one's age at thecellular level. 1These two numbers are oftentimes not equal. Some horses remain physically active and healthy well into their twenties and yet othersbecome biologically \"old\" or \"geriatric\" by mid to lateteens. These individual differences are due to avariety of factors including genetics, environment,and management practices to name a few. For thepurposes of this review we will refer in general tothe aged horse as being \"old\" rather than geriatric.With regard to chronological age for an \"older\"horse, we will use /H1135020 years of age, given that this is a common age cutoff used in scientic studieswhen comparing physiological responses of \"old\"horses to \"younger\" horses. Descriptions of the aged horse population statis- tics are limited to a few. In 2003, Brosnahan andParadis 2surveyed horse owners and they perceived their horses as being old at approximately 22 years AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 481HOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENT NOTESof age. Data from a retrospective study showedthat in 1989 only 2% of equine referral cases at auniversity veterinary hospital were greater than 20years of age but this had increased to 12.5% by 1999and to approximately 20% by 2003. 2However, in 2005 a survey of the horse population in the UnitedStates reported only 7.6% of the total population tobe greater than 20 years of age. It has been esti-mated that 29% of the United Kingdom equine pop-ulation is 15 years or older. 3,4 Clinical Conditions Associated With Aging There are several clinical conditions that are ac-knowledged as being more prominent in the olderhorse. And although these conditions may be pres-ent in younger horses, the problem increases withage. In a survey conducted in 2005, owners consid-ered approximately 43% of horses ( /H1135020 y) to be suffering from health disorders compared with ap-proximately 33% in the 6-10-year-old age group. 5 The most frequently reported problems in horses 20years and older fall into the category of gastrointes-tinal, musculoskeletal, and respiratory problems. 6 In a more recent survey, owners were most con-cerned with weight loss, arthritis and lameness, anddental problems in caring for \"old\" horses. 7The most commonly cited clinical conditions of the the following: - ductive function of the mare;14and increased risk for bacterial and viral infections.15,16Toward the latter, a decline in immune function likely contrib- utes to this increased risk of certain conditions withaging in the horse. Immunosenescence and Inflamm-Aging It has been appreciated for many years that theimmune system undergoes gradual deteriorationwith age, referred to as immunosenescence. 17The classic view of immunosenescence has recognized age-related changes of the immune system as unidi-rectional declines in function. However, recentstudies suggest that this process is more complex inwhich nearly every component of the immune sys-tem undergoes age-associated changes leading toboth diminished and enhanced \"inflamm-aging\" 18 characteristics. The two terms, immunosenescenceand inflamm-aging, may sounds contradictory; how-ever, they are intertwined as reviewed below. Immunosenescence is the biological aging process associated with the progressive decline in overallsystemic immunity and increased prevalence of can-cer, autoimmune and chronic diseases, poor re-sponses to vaccination, and increased susceptibilityto common infectious diseases. As reviewed, bothinnate and adaptive arms of the immune system areaffected by immunosenescence with a wide range ofcell types of the immune system including: 1) he- matopoietic stem cells, lymphoid progenitors in thebone and thymus, stroma; 192) in-nate response; 20and B-cells and T-cells.21,22 Horses, like other species, experience thymic in- volution.23Few studies have investigated the in - nate immune system of the horse. To date, theinnate immune system of the horse seems to remainintact with age. A study by Horohov and col-leagues 24demonstrated that aged horses (mean age, 25 y) had lymphokine-activated killer cell activity equivalent to that of younger animals (mean age,7.5 y). Circulating monocyte and granulocytecounts in young and aged horses are also reported tobe similar. 25These ndings are in concordance with those of human studies, as are the below stud- ies investigating the adaptive immune system of theaged horse. Studies have looked at age-associated changes in lymphocyte populations ( /H1135020 y) and found that old horses exhibit a decline in the total lymphocytecount, as well as lymphocyte subset cell signicant differences in the immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes in aged horses compared with youngercontrols, although there was a trend toward a higherconcentration of IgA and IgG. 26 Among the immunological changes in aged hu- mans and experimental animals, T cells are mostfrequently found to be responsible for defects in hu-moral and cell-mediated immunity. 28-30Moreover, dysfunctional T cells have been shown to be corre- lated with increased morbidity and mortality in theelderly. 31The most noted changes in T cell popu - lations of the elderly are decreased na\u00efve T cells,32 expanded pools of dysfunctional memory T cells,33,34 shrinkage of the T cell repertoire, and decreased Tcell proliferative responses in vitro. 28,32,35In fact, decreased T cell proliferation is a hallmark charac- teristic of immunosenescence in many species in-cluding, humans, 29primates,36mice,37cats,38 dogs,39and horses.27,40 Proliferation of T cells or clonal expansion is es- sential for maintaining function of the adaptive im-mune system. 28During development, T cells generate receptors that will allow recognition of all the possible antigens they will encounter over thelife span (Janeway et al., 2005), so that when alymphocyte generates and expresses its antigen re-ceptor, that receptor specicity does not change.Thus, antigen specicity is maintained as lympho-cytes divide and mature into effector cells, which areinvolved in clearance of the antigen. Once this oc-curs most of the cells die by apoptosis, leaving asmall number of memory cells with the same anti-gen-receptor specicity. 41Repeated exposure to antigen results in the process of activation and pro- liferation begins again. T-cell proliferation is crit-ical because there are an innite number of antigensthat could be encountered over a lifetime when com- 482 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTpared with the number of cells that can respond to asingle antigen. 42,43Thus, proliferation is an impor - tant process in generating sufcient numbers of Tcells to ght an infection. Mechanisms responsible for decreased prolifera- tion are not completely known. In one study ofaged horse immunosenescence, T-cell proliferationremained depressed after supplementation with re-combinant interleukin (IL)-2, suggesting that de-creased proliferation cannot be solely attributed todecreased expression of IL-2. 27Telomere-driven replicative exhaustion has been proposed as mecha- nism leading to immunosenescence in both T and Blymphocytes. Telomeres are specialized proteinstructures that cap and protect the ends of chromo-somes to maintain stability and integrity of theDNA. Telomeres shorten with each cycle of celldivision, and sufcient telomere loss acts as a mo-lecular clock that triggers cell senescence. Progres-sive telomere shortening with age in humans hasbeen demonstrated in many studies and this age-associated loss of telomeres has been observed indifferent types of leukocytes. In fact, we have re-cently shown that this age-associated loss of telo-meres occurs in equine peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells and was correlated with decreased pro-liferation potential and other immunosenescentcharacteristics. 44 Inflamm-Aging and Consequences A lifetime of exposure to antigens such as influenzaand herpesvirus just to name a few can have aneffect on immunosenescence and contribute to theprocess of inflamm-aging by a theory known asclonal exhaustion. 45In fact, latent viral infections in elderly humans such as cytomegalovirus have been shown to be highly associated with a chronic,low-grade, pro-inflammatory state called, inflamm-aging. 18Although this exact association has yet to be determined for the aged horse, the process of inflamm-aging has been well characterized. Inflammation is a complex networking of mole- cular and cellular interactions directed to returnphysiological homeostasis. 46Unlike acute inflam - mation, chronic inflammation is not resolved withinminutes or hours but involves immune responses, inparticular cytokine production, tissue injury, andhealing that occur over a long period. 46It's an im - balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cyto-kines that contributes to the process of age-associated chronic inflammation. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are released by cells of bothinnate (dendritic tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- /H9251) cytokines are multifunctional and are produced by a variety of cell types. All ofthese cytokines have been demonstrated to be in-volved in the complex process of inflamm-aging.Serum levels IL- 1050is decreased. Furthermore, it has been shown in vitro that as T cells undergo replicative senes- cence, /H9251.28In vitro the dysfunctional activity of senescentcells in vivo. Elevated levels of these inflammatory cytokines, in particular TNF- /H9251and IL-6, have been associated with morbidity and predict mortality in the el-derly. 49,52Moreover, chronic inflammation is a characteristic part of the pathological processes of age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis,53osteo - arthritis,54Alzheimer's,55Parkinson's,56osteoporo - sis,57and type 2 diabetes.58However, it still remains controversial whether inflammatory medi- ators have primary casual relationship or simplycontribute and/or aggravate the pathologies of theseage-related diseases or may be the consequence ofage-related diseases. 18,49,52,59 More recently, studies have shown that aged horses, like humans, show evidence of inflamm-ag-ing that may contribute to the development of age-associated conditions such as arthritis, cancer,diabetes, osteoporosis, dementia, vascular diseases,obesity, and metabolic syndrome. More speci-cally, it has been shown that old horses have signif-icantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 /H9252, IL-15, IL-18, and TNF- /H9251) in peripheral whole blood when compared with younger horses.60In addition, Adams and colleagues60found that old horses compared with young horses have increased inflammatory cytokine (TNF- /H9251and andthe frequency of these cells in circulation are alsoincreased. Moreover, it was found that obese oldhorses have even higher frequencies of lymphocytesand monocytes producing cytokines(TNF- /H9251and IFN- /H9253) compared with old thin horses.61 This may suggest that increased adiposity or obesitymay contribute to the inflamm-aging process. Re-duction of body weight and adiposity in these signicantly This age-related dysregulation of pro-inflamma- tory cytokine production has not only been shown tooccur in the peripheral blood samples but recentlythis inflamm-aging phenomenon has been shown tooccur in the lung. Bronchoalveolar-lavage cellswere collected from clinically healthy horses andproduction of inflammation was measured. 62The frequency of IFN- /H9253-producing lymphocytes in both bronchoalveolar lavage and peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) from old horses was signi-cantly increased compared with the young horses. 62 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 may be a cofactor for the patho-genesis of equine airway diseases. Furthermore,when old horses were subjected to an influenza chal-lenge, they showed an exacerbated increased pro-duction of pro-inflammatory cytokines post-infection, which is consistent with the concept ofinflamm-aging, an enhanced pro-inflammatory stateobserved in the elderly. 15,18Alongside the concept that aged horses show evidence of a pro-inflamma- tory state that may contribute to development ofage-associated diseases, it has been shown thathorses with PPID have changes in the expression ofpro-inflammatory or chemokines, which may influ-ence the ability of these horses to respond to bacte-rial pathogens. 63Thus, it is critical to further characterize and understand the cause of inflamm- aging in old horses and what exactly does this in-flamm-aging phenomenon mean or tell us about howwell or not the horse is aging. This chronic inflammatory activity is not only as- sociated with age-related diseases but is commonlyproposed as a promoter of biological aging in gen-eral, and of leukocyte telomere shortening in partic-ular. Leukocyte telomere length is an emergingmarker of biological age. 64We have shown that there is an age-associated loss of telomeres in horse peripheral blood mononuclear cells and this is notonly related to their proliferation potential but alsoto the increased pro-inflammatory cytokine produc-tion. 44Thus, older horses with high levels of in - flammatory activity may be at increased risk foraccelerated leukocyte telomere shortening, andthose with short telomeres may suffer the conse-quences of increased risk for diseases with an in-flammatory etiology. Immunosenescence and Vaccination All of these changes of inflamm-aging and immu-nosensecence likely contribute to reduced respon-siveness to vaccination and infectious agents. 17,28,65 Studies have examined immune responses to influ-enza vaccination to evaluate the secondary or ana-mnestic immune responses. These studies haveshown that old horses compared with youngerhorses have a reduced humoral immune response toinactivated influenza virus vaccines. 24,66,67In con - trast with measuring an anamnestic response, onestudy has investigated antibody production follow-ing exposure to rabies antigen, which was used tomeasure primary immune response. This was pos-sible because the study was performed on PrinceEdward Island, which is rabies free; thus, mosthorses are not vaccinated against rabies. 66A pri - mary immune response occurs when an animal isexposed to an antigen for the rst time. This pri-mary response involves the process of recruiting na-\u00efve lymphocytes, which become activated, and mustbe able to proliferate and nally create memory Tand B cells. These memory cells will play a role inproviding protection from subsequent challenges bythe same antigen. Interestingly, results of this study demonstrated that aged horses mounted anti-body responses similar to younger horses. 66How - ever, it was found that aged horses may havegreater difculty maintaining an adequate antibodytiter after a single dose of rabies vaccine comparedwith younger horses. 66Perhaps alternative vacci - nation approaches may prove more efcacious inaged horses. Thus, a study measuring both anti-body and cell-mediated immune responses of agedhorses to a canarypox-recombinant virus vector ex-pressing the haemagglutinin antigen of influenza a was undertaken.15The vaccine was effective at in - ducing both antibody and cell-mediated immune re-sponses of young na\u00efve horses. Although the oldhorses had prior evidence of pre-existing immunityto influenza, their antibody responses were en-hanced only slightly by the vaccine. The old horses'cell-mediated immune responses post vaccinatewere evident but not statistically signicant overtime. 15Although all of these vaccine studies mea - sured immune responses of aged horses to vaccina-tion, no studies had investigated vaccine efcacyexcept for the later study by Adams and col-leagues. 15Adams and colleagues15demonstrated that aged horses remain susceptible to infection with equine influenza virus despite the presence ofcirculating antibodies and cell-mediated immune re-sponses to equine influenza. Although the vaccineinduced signicant antibody responses in agedhorses but not cell-mediated immune responses, thecanarypox-vectored influenza vaccine did provideprotection from clinical disease in these aged horses.Following this study and described below, we con-ducted an experimental trial comparing the immuneresponses of aged horses to modied live vaccinetechnology acompared with inactivated or killed vac - cine technologyb,cgiven that live vaccines are thought to better mimic a natural infection and thus inducing the best immune response post vaccina-tion. Further, and described below, we conducted astudy to determine whether equine PPID affectsimmune responses to vaccination. Nutrition in Enhancing Immunity in the Old Horse Nutritional immunology is a new eld of study, inwhich nutrition is used as a modiable factor inaffecting immune function, in particular to delay/reverse immunosenescence and to improve the agedresistance to infection. Further, nutritional inter-ventions are practical, cost-effective approaches tomitigating this age-related breakdown in immune function. Natural dietary compounds found in avariety of plants, roots, fruits, vegetables, nuts, andseeds are promising candidates in helping to combatthe effects of an aging immune system. They pos-sess broad activities: anti-oxidative, enzyme activities, im-proving immune responses to vaccination. 68 484 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTGiven that old horses have increased levels of inflammation and long-term use of nonsteroidal an-ti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flunixinmeglumine and phenylbutazone can pose healthproblems, there is a lot of interest in nutritionalinterventions to counteract this inflamm-aging pro-cess. Recently, we compared flavonoid and poly-phenolic compounds with main dietary sources ofblueberries, red NSAIDs vitro, as a preliminary to invivo research. 69We isolated white blood cells from aged horses and incubated them overnight with each compound or NSAID at multiple concentra-tions and measured inflammation production whencells were stimulated. At varying doses, each curcuminoids seem tohave the potential to outperform NSAIDs. d Few studies have been conducted to better under- stand what effect nutrition may have on modulatingor improving immune responses of the aged horse.Petersson and colleagues 70conducted a study to ex - amine the effect of vitamin E supplementation onimmune function and response to vaccination inolder horses. Vitamin E is considered one of themost effective nutrients to enhance immune func-tion. Vitamin E, a very effective chain-breaking,lipid-soluble antioxidant present in the membraneof all cells, and is particularly enriched in immunecells, which protects them from oxidative damage. 68 Vitamin E supplementation in the aged, has beenshown to enhance immune response, which is possi-bly associated with increased resistance against sev-eral pathogens. 68In the study conducted by Petersson and colleagues,70horses were supple - mented with 15 times the Nutrient Requirements ofHorses (2007) daily for 16 weeks and immune re-sponses measured throughout. The results of thisstudy showed that vitamin E supplementation im-proved the bacterial killing ability of monocytes andneutrophils. Furthermore, humoral immune re-sponses were enhanced, as evidenced by increases inparticular subclasses of IgG concentrations in re-sponse to vaccination in the vitamin E-supple-mented aged horses. Prebiotics and probiotics, generally categorized as functional foods, are increasingly being recognizedas effective, immune-modulating nutritional factors.These functional foods are thought to modulate theimmune system at the mucosal surfaces throughoutthe gastrointestinal tract. In fact, several studieshave shown that supplementation with either ofthese functional foods can enhance both the innateand adaptive arms of the immune system in agedsubjects. 68Thus, we recently conducted a series of studies which are discussed below in collaborationwith Purina Animal Nutrition, in which old horses were fed a diet feedewith and without a proprietary, prebiotic additive for a period of time, followed by challenging the immune response. 2. Methods Comparison of Immune Responses in Aged Horses Given Commercially Available Live or Inactivated EquineInfluenza Vaccines Here, we conducted an experimental trial comparing the immune responses of aged horses to modiedlive vaccine technology acompared with inactivated or killed vaccine technologyb,cgiven that live vac - cines are thought to better mimic a natural infectionand thus induce the best immune response postvaccination. The aim of this study was to comparethe immune responses of aged horses given twodoses of commercially available live or inactivatedinfluenza vaccine. Twenty-six old horses ( /H1135020 y) were included in this study, all of which had pre-existing hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodytiters. Treatment groups were stratied based recombinant and NM/93), and 4) (n /H110056) nonvaccinate controls. Serum samples were collected prior to(day 0) and post vaccination (days 7 and 14). Four-teen days (day 28) after the rst vaccination, allhorses received a second vaccination, and serumcollected on days 35 and 42. Antibody responseswere measured by HI and single-radial hemolysisagainst the homologous virus for each vaccine andagainst a heterologous virus (KY/02). Followingthis study and given the fact that PPID affects alarge number of older horses, we wanted to answerthe below question. Does Equine PPID Affect Immune Responses to Vaccination? During the past decade the aged horse population has expanded signicantly with 20-30% of theequine population composed of geriatric horses ( /H1135020 y), and of these horses approximately 30% are af-fected by PPID, a progressive and debilitating endo-crine disease. Thus, we recently conducted a studycomparing antibody responses to a (combination)multi-valent vaccine fin non-PPID, age-matched control horses to PPID horses (testing either positive using the dexamethasone suppression test [DST]and/or testing positive using the thyrotropin releas-ing hormone [TRH]-stimulation test). 71A total of 33 aged horses of mixed sex and breed were used in this study. All horses were prescreened to deter-mine EIV antibody titers and PPID status based onresponses to a DST and a TRH-stimulation test.Further, all horses were assigned a numeric valuefor severity of clinical signs (hair coat, muscle con-dition, etc.) of PPID by two blinded DVMs via an PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. /H114082016 post- TRH-stimulation test. Horses with PPID were fur-ther characterized by either double positive (DP)(DST no suppression and pre-TRH ACTH [ 10 minutes post-TRH [ /H11350110 pg/mL]) single positive (SP) (DST suppression but pre-TRHACTH [/H1135035 pg/mL] and 10 minutes post TRH [ /H11350110 pg/mL]) responders. Treatment groups were ran-domly blocked according to these measures, along with age, to the following vaccinate groups: Group1: Non-PPID horses, vaccinated IM with a combi-nation (multi-valent) vaccine f(n/H1100512); Group 2: Non-PPID controls, receiving a sterile saline vacci- nation (n /H110053); 3: PPID horses (DP, SP, n/H110057) vaccinatedf; and Group (n PPID receiving sterile saline vaccine (DP, n /H110052; SP, n/H110052). Peripheral blood titer sures to EIV, EHV-1, and WNV were collected priorto the rst vaccination (week 0) and again at week 2and 4 post vaccination. A second multi-valent vac-cine for saline control was given at week 4 and blood collected at weeks 6 and week 8 post vaccination. Parasite Control and the Aged Horse As part of the care and management of horses, par-asite control is of importance. Given the changes inthe immune system with age, it remains to be de-termined the effect of age on levels of strongyle fecalegg counts and the possible inflammatory responsesto anthelmintic treatment in geriatric horses. Thus,we recently conducted an experiment to evaluatewhether aged horses demonstrate statisticallyhigher fecal egg counts (FEC) compared with mid-dle-age adult horses and to investigate systemic ex-pression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in old andmiddle-age horses treated with moxidectin com-pared with horses treated with pyrantel pamoate. 72 Old horses (n /H1100521) and middle-age horses (n /H1100519) were blocked by levels of inflammation and ran-domly allocated to one of the following treatmentgroups: Group 1 (n /H110058), old treated with moxidec- tin gel; Group 2 (n /H110059), old treated with pyrantel pamoate paste; Group 3 (n /H110054), old receiving no Group 4 (n /H110058), middle-age treated with moxidectin paste; and Group 6 (n /H110054) middle-age receiving no treatment. Fecal sampleswere collected on day 0 and again 14 days after treatment to determine FECs and presence of Strongylus vulgaris by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Peripheral blood was also collected on day 0and again at days 3, 5, and 14 after deworming forinflammatory cytokine analysis, along with routinehematological analyses.What Does for the Aged Horse? PPID is an endocrinopathy commonly associated with aging in the equine population. Inflamm-ag-ing (systemic low-grade chronic inflammation) alsooccurs with aging. Little is currently known aboutwhether the inflammation or nutritional status ofgeriatric horses may be associated with the occur-rence of PPID. Sarcopenia frequently accompaniesPPID; thus, muscle mass is also of interest. Todetermine whether inflamm-aging, nutritional sta-tus, muscle mass, and PPID status may be corre-lated, various measures of these parameters werecompared in geriatric horses. 73Forty-three old horses (mean 24.4 /H110063.0 y) were used to measure immune, endocrine, muscle, fatty acid, vitamin, andmineral parameters. PBMCs were isolated blood, from PBMCs and underwent PCRs to deter-mine inflammatory cytokines.Serum IL-6, Serum vitamin, acid, andmineral levels were also measured. Muscle and fatmass were determined via ultrasound; muscle scoreswere also assigned (0-3). Thryotropin-releasinghormone (TRH) stimulation was performed to deter-mine PPID status, in which ACTH levels were mea-sured in plasma pre and 10 minutes post (T-10)intravenous administration of TRH (1 mg/mL salineper horse). Pearson correlation testing was per-formed to determine correlations between variousparameters. Nutrition in Enhancing Immunity in the Old Horse The objective of the rst study was to determinewhether feeding of a proprietary prebiotic additive g or a source of omega-3 fatty acids (marine-derivedDHA) would improve immune response to vac-cination and decrease inflamm-aging in geriatrichorses. 71Forty horses (20-33 y) of mixed breed and sex were pre-screened for and blocked to one of four treatment groups by inflammatory status andpre-existing antibody titers to influenza: tradi-tional control (control /H11001prebiotic g;n/H1100510). Horses were fed isocaloric diets with respective treatments (adjusted to maintain body condition) individuallytwice daily for 161 days and were allowed free-choiceaccess to mixed grass hay while housed on pasture.Horses were weighed, assigned BCS, and blood sam-ples were taken throughout the study to day 56, allhorses received two separate vaccinations, anequine influenza vaccine and a novel antigen (OVA). 486 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTOVA vaccination was boosted on day 70. Prior toand 2 weeks post-vaccination, blood samples werecollected to determine influenza and OVA-specicimmune responses. A randomized factorial split-plot design was used to determine the effect of treat-ment, time, and treatment /H11003time interactions with signicance level of P/H11021.05. The objective of the second study was to determine the effect of feeding different levels of prebiotic g supplementation on immune function in agedhorses. Thirty-two aged ( /H1135020 y) horses of mixed sex and breed were assigned to one of four treatmentgroups: control diet e(ES; n /H110058), /H110058). Horses were fed isocaloric diets with respective treatments (adjusted to maintainbody condition) individually twice daily for 86 daysand were allowed free-choice access to mixed grasshay while housed on pasture. Horses wereweighed, assigned BCS, and blood samples weretaken throughout the study on days 0, 35, 56, and 86to measure horses were vaccinated with a novelantigen (KLH) on days 28 and 42 and with an equineinfluenza vaccine con day 42. Prior to vaccination and 2 weeks post-vaccination, blood samples were collected to determine influenza- and KLH-specicimmune responses using an antigen-specic ELISAand a HI assay. Data was checked for normalityand log transformed if necessary. A completelyrandomized factorial split-plot design was used totest the effect of treatment, time, age, sex, and treat-ment/H11003time interaction. ANOVA was performed with mixed models and least-squares means com-pared with Fisher's LSD with a signicance level ofP/H11349.05 and trend of P/H11349.10. 3. Results Comparison of Immune Responses in Aged Horses Given Commercially Available Live or Inactivated EquineInfluenza Vaccines Prior to vaccination, there was no signicant differ-ence in HI or SRH antibody titers between allgroups. Post vaccination, there was a signicantincrease in both HI and SRH titers for all threevaccine groups (day 0 vs day 7; P/H11021.05) but no change when comparing day 7 vs day 14 results.We found that both inactivated vaccines induced asignicantly ( P/H11021.05) higher antibody response when compared with the recombinant, modied livevaccine. Most surprisingly, we found that inacti-vated EIV vaccine h(OH/03 and KY/95 and NM/93) outperformed both inducing signicant (P/H11021.05) cell-mediated immune responses post vac- cination (Data recently submitted to VII for publi-cation, Adams, et al., 2016). Both inactivatedvaccines induced a signicantly ( P/H11021.05) higher antibody response when compared with the recom-binant vaccine. Administration of a second vaccine dose did not increase the antibody responses in anyof the vaccine groups. Does Equine PPID Affect Immune Responses to Vaccination? Results suggested that all horses receiving vaccina- tion responded signicantly with an increase in EIVand EHV-1 antibody titers post vaccination. Fur-ther, results suggested that no in EIV EHV-1 and WNV humoral immune responses among the PPIDhorses. Thus, vaccination in the face of PPID doeshave an effect on how these horses respond immu-nologically (Adams AA, et al., AAEP 2014). Fur-ther characterization of the duration of immunityand vaccine efcacy of PPID horses compared withnon-PPID horses is warranted. Parasite Control and the Aged Horse Results of this study suggested that old horses havesignicantly higher FEC than the group of middle-aged adults. 71FECs declined signicantly follow - ing anthelmintic treatment in both age groups ofhorses. Several of the measured inflammatorymarkers did exhibit pronounced differences betweenage groups, and this study provided evidence ofhigher expression of IFN- /H9253, TNF- /H9251, IL-6, and A (SAA) post deworming in the old horsegroup. In summary, this study provided evidenceof different inflammatory and immunologic reac-tions to anthelmintic treatment in oldhorses. Moreover, the higher strongyle egg countsfound in the old-horse group may have practicalimplications for parasite management routines im-plemented on farms with representation of this agegroup. What Does Inflamm-Aging Mean for the Aged Horse? Baseline ACTH and T-10 (R /H110050.631; P/H11021.001) Age andT-10 ACTH (R /H110050.256; P/H11005.0973) exhibited fatty acid, vita-min, or mineral measures. Inflammatory markersalso did not seem to be correlated with ACTH; thus,PPID and inflamm-aging may not be associated.Age, however, exhibited positive correlation withfatty acids C18:2n6c, C20:4n6c, negative correlation with fattyacids C20:1n9c, fat-free mass, fat weight,and muscle score ( P/H11021.05). The correlation of age with various measured parameters suggests thatage plays a role in regulating inflammatory andmetabolic function of the horse. 72 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 487HOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTNutrition in Enhancing Immunity in the Old Horse Results of the rst study showed that all horsesgained weight and increased BCS over time (P /H11021 .05). TNF- /H9251(RT-PCR and ELISA) was lower in CA than C at the end of the study on days 105, 133, and161 ( P/H11021.05). IL-6 (ELISA) decreased in TGM over time (P /H11021.05). IFN- /H9253(RT-PCR) was lower in CA and C than TGM at day 161 ( P/H11021.05), and overall, IFN- /H9253(IS/FC) increased over time in TGM, C, and CDHA, but not in CA ( P/H11021.05). There were no effects of diet on vaccination response, but there wasa negative correlation between OVA titer and age(R/H11005/H110020.32; P/H11021.05). Overall, horses receiving the diet prebiotic additive exhibited alower inflamm-aging status post-treatment whencompared with horses receiving the other three di-ets. Thus, the addition of a prebiotic gmay help protect against the negative effects of aging on im- mune response in old horses.73 Results of the second study showed that all horses slightly lost weight but increased in BCS over time.Levels of the key inflammatory cytokines TNF- /H9251and IFN- /H9253increased in ES but ESA1, ESA2, or ESA3 (P /H11021.05). IL-6 decreased over time ( P/H11021.05). Influenza antibody titers were higher in ESA2 than ES and ESA3 at day 56(P/H11021.05), and the increase in influenza antibody titers was greatest in ESA1 (P /H11021.05). There were no effects of diet on KLH-specic vaccinationresponse. 4. Discussion Taken together, these studies show that althoughaged horses have pre-existing immune responses topathogens, these levels may not be sufcient enoughto provide the animal protection in the face of aninfectious challenge. Thus, vaccination is impor-tant to maintain a protective level of immunity andby preserving memory responses. Thus, it is criti-cal to ensure that clients keep their old horses up todate with the core vaccines, provided by the Ameri-can Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP).We do see some changes in how some horses withPPID respond to vaccinations. Thus, if clients haveolder, more at-risk horses such as horses with PPID,and perhaps older horses that are still showing andtraveling, it might mean potentially vaccinatingthese horse more often, perhaps boosting that horsewith West Nile vaccine at 6 months rather than justannually, for instance, especially in a region with along mosquito season. Regardless, keep olderhorses up to date with annual core-based vaccina-tions if they are not traveling, consider giving risk-based vaccinations, and perhaps consider boostingevery 6 months. It is important to consider targeted nutrition to help support the immune response. Results of thisstudy showed that old horses supplemented with theprebiotic yeast had reduced levels of inflammationand enhanced humoral immune responses after vac-cination compared with horses not receiving thesupplement. Thus, nutritional intervention regi- mens can improve the immune function of the agedhorse. Moreover, an appropriate nutritional pro-gram is important to implement based on endocrinestatus, in particular screen for insulin resistance tohelp establish the nutritional program of these olderhorses. Given the changes in the immune system with age in horses and the fact that the immune system isimportant in regulating tolerance to parasites, it iscritical to implement FECs as part of routine orannual geriatric horse healthcare. Results fromour studies suggested that older horses have signif-icantly higher FEC than middle-age adults. FECsdeclined signicantly after anthelmintic treatmentin both age groups of horses. Thus, the higherFECs found in the old horse group may have prac-tical implications for parasite management routineson farms with representation of this age group, how-ever, peform FECs and FEC reduction tests to guidethe parasite control with aged horses. Do notassume. Lastly, we know that inflamm-aging (systemic low-grade chronic inflammation) also occurs withaging in horses; however, more research is war-ranted to understand what this means for geriatrichorse healthcare. Ongoing studies are being con-ducted to understand whether inflamm-aging hasany relationships with age-related conditions in thehorse including osteoarthritis, insulin resistance,etc. with the goal being to offer clients additionalbiomarkers to allow for additional annual screeningto determine whether the horse is aging healthy ornot, so stay tuned. The eld of anti-aging researchis growing exponentially in human medicine, and weexpect this area of research and practice to grow inequine medicine. Regardless, not only is it critical to implement annual or bi-annual vaccination and FEC schedulesfor geriatric horses, it is also important to consideradding the following into your Spring and Fall well-ness plan for aging horses: dental exams, endo-crine screening for PPID and insulin resistance,body condition evaluation, weight tapes, front andside prole photos, nutritional evaluation and con-sultations, lameness evaluations, lateral feet radio-graphs, hoof tests, and examinations. Moreover, itis important to consider offering some educationalprograms on senior horse healthcare to the ownersof these older horses to engage interest in maintain-ing wellness plan programs for these horses in yourpractice.

Wilkins, DVM, MS, PhD, DACVIM, DACVECC Author's address: Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine, Illinois-Champaign, Urbana, IL urachus a relatively common problemidentied in foals during the neonatal period. Theurachus is the extension of the urinary bladder ofthe fetus to the allantoic cavity, contained retroper-itoneally within the umbilical cord between the twoumbilical arteries, and is involved in the removal ofnitrogenous wastes from the fetus. In humans theurachus is generally closed by 12 weeks of gestationand becomes the median ligament of the bladder,although it may very rarely be patent. 1The me - dian ligament of the bladder serves to support theventrally oriented and upright position of thebladder. Species with epitheliochorial placentation and re- tention of both the allantoic cavity and containedfluids throughout gestation, such as the horse, willhave an open and functional urachus until the timethe umbilical cord separates at parturition, leavingboth internal and external umbilical remnants. 2,3 Although functional closure of the urachus occurs atthis time, anatomic closure does not. The urinarybladder and associated internal umbilical remnantgradually retract from the body wall during the rstseveral weeks of life, leaving the umbilical arteriesto become the round ligaments of the bladder andthe umbilical vein to become the Falciform ligamentof the liver and the urachus involutes. The sup- porting fold of the urachus present in prenatal lifeprimarily involutes with the urachus followingbirth, but a small fold remains to become the medianligament of the bladder, attaching the ventralsurface of bladder to the pelvic floor and the lineaalba. 4-6 Following birth the umbilical cord will naturally separate at a site located approximately 2-3 cmfrom the hairline, corresponding to narrowing of theumbilical arteries and vein. 2,3The external umbil - ical stump may display some variable patency for upto 24 hours as it dries out and involutes over a3-7-day period. The umbilical stump should becompletely healed by 3-4 weeks of age. 3 Routine care of the umbilical stump has been well described. Dipping of the umbilical stump of new-born foals into a variety of disinfectant solutions twoto three times daily following birth is common prac- tice. Solutions used of dilute solutions have been shown to signicantly de-crease the incidence of umbilical stalk infection anddeath in human infants and is most commonly rec-ommended for foals. 7,8Care should also be used with application of silver nitrate, historically and still commonly used to promote urachal closure, AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 491HOW-TO SESSION: LIFE MANAGEMENT NOTESgiven that a necrotic focus can develop. Excessivedrying caused by application of concentrated iodinesolutions or silver nitrate causes bacterial trappingand tissue devitalization, providing a favorable en-vironment for bacterial growth and promoting pa-tency of the urachus. 3,7 2. Recognition of Patent Urachus Patent urachus is readily recognized when a foal iseither observed to have a stream of urine originatingfrom the umbilicus or it is noticed that the hairaround the umbilicus is consistently wet. Regionalurine scalding of the skin may be apparent if urinehas been emanating from the urachus for a period oftime and there may be local maceration of skin atthe umbilicus or in regions of the ventral abdomenand medial hind limbs. Identication of urachalpatency can be somewhat challenging in male foalsthat urinate into their prepuce, more common if thepenile frenulum is still intact. In these cases, plac-ing a flat hand perpendicular to midline and ori-ented vertically on the ventrum between theumbilicus and the prepuce will deflect the urinestream originating from the prepuce and allow di-rect visualization of any urine stream from theumbilicus. 3. Evaluation of Patent Urachus History is an important component of evaluation forpatent urachus. Patent urachus can developshortly after birth or later in the rst 7-14 days oflife. Foals with patent urachus may present as oth-erwise healthy, showing early signs of infectiousdisease, or with prolonged recumbency due to an-other primary disease process. It is seldom a com-plaint of foals older than 2 weeks of age and theauthor has not recognized a case of patent urachusin a foal of weaning age. There are no studies di-rected fully at the evaluation of patent urachus as asingle entity or following the fate of the urachus\u2014and the internal umbilical remnant\u2014sequentiallyduring the rst weeks and months of life in normalfoals. If available, knowledge of the circumstancesof parturition may be benecial as may informationrelated to periparturient problems such as dystociaor placental abnormalities. The umbilical cord itself may contribute to patent urachus and other umbilical problems. 2,3,9,10An excessively long umbilical cord can be associatedwith umbilical cord torsion, predisposing to urachalcompromise by causing obstruction of blood flow andobstruction to urine flow from the fetal urinary blad-der to the allantoic cavity. Decreased cord length(/H1102130 cm) predisposes to increased traction on theumbilical cord that can compromise the integrity ofthe urachus. In addition to addressing questions of history and placental abnormalities, a thorough physical exam-ination should be undertaken with particular atten-tion paid to the umbilical remnant. Patent urachusis associated in many reports with infection withother umbilical structures and also with uroperito- neum secondary to failure of urachal integrity. 11-15 Routine clinical pathology testing including CBC,plasma or serum chemistry, and assessment of ade-quacy of passive transfer of maternal immunityshould be performed. Ultrasonographic examination is an important di- agnostic and monitoring tool in cases of patent ura-chus and examination of the umbilical remnant hasbeen reviewed and extensively presented elsewhere. The presence of patent urachus in a neonatal foal suggests that the umbilical remnant is abnormal.It does not, however, suggest any specic abnormality.Causes of patent urachus can be categorized asfollows: Simple Patent Urachus In these cases patency may be present immediatelyafter birth or become apparent in the rst few daysof life in an otherwise-healthy and vigorous foal.This form of patent urachus generally resolves spon-taneously as the foal becomes more active and mic-turates more frequently, applying tension to theinternal umbilical remnant and encouraging closureof the urachus. Historically, the umbilical cordmay have broken close to the foal or been cut or tiedoff close to the foal. These cases may also be ob-served in male foals urinating into their prepuce,resulting in a constantly wet macerated umbilicalstump. In some cases the umbilical stump mayhave been treated often and vigorously, again result-ing in a constantly wet umbilical stump. Paradox-ically, use of silver nitrate or higher concentrationsof iodine solutions can result in patent urachus sec-ondary to excessive drying and subsequent necrosisof the umbilical stump. 3 Mechanical Patent Urachus Patency of the functionally but not yet anatomicallyclosed urachus may occur secondary to abdominalstraining, such as seen with meconium retention/impaction or stranguria secondary to urachitis.Urachitis is commonly associated with urachal di-verticulum, where the urachal portion closest to thebladder remains open, resulting in some urine pool-ing in the urachus. 16,17This condition is only rec - ognized with an ultrasonographic examination ofthe internal umbilical remnant and can result inminor discomfort and straining following urinationbut generally requires no specic treatment andusually resolves within 1-3 days. Infectious Patent Urachus The urachus becomes patent associated with infec-tion of structures of the internal umbilical remnantand generally manifests when a foal is several daysto 1-2 weeks of age. Infection may remain clini-cally silent for a period of time but localized clinicalsigns of umbilical stump swelling, purulent dis-charge, heat and pain on palpation are compatiblewith umbilical infection. The umbilical stump 492 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENTshould be evaluated daily for evidence of local infec-tion although infection may not manifest externally.Inflammation, infection, and necrosis can becomelocally extensive. In these cases where infectionhas become locally extensive, or becomes systemic,clinical signs may include fever, depression, andpoor suckling. 3,11-14It has been postulated that infection might ascend along the urachus to the urinary tract and facilitate bacteremia.3,11-14Lo- cal urachal infection may also result in uroperito-neum due to formation of internal urachal defectsassociated with areas of necrosis; foals with urachalinfection or trauma should be ultrasonographicallyevaluated frequently, even daily, for this complica-tion. 13Development of uroperitoneum generally requires surgical intervention and correction by re- moval of the umbilical remnant once the foal ismedically stable. Detailed discussion of uroperito-neum, including identication and treatment, is be-yond the scope of this article. Urachal Patency Associated With Critical Illness Foals with critical illness\u2014such as sepsis, neonatalmaladjustment syndrome, prematurity\u2014or withproblems experience recumbency. Devel-opment of patent urachus is almost considered anexpected problem in these cases by experienced cli-nicians. Its genesis is generally similar to simplepatent urachus, with components of mechanical pat-ent urachus, given that the ventrum of these foalsare frequently damp, causing maceration of the um-bilical stump, and they are not assuming a normalbody position to urinate. Trauma secondary to re-cumbency may also result in early loss of the umbil-ical stump. These foals may not recognize a fullbladder and the need to urinate, resulting in in-creased pressure on the urachus from the full blad-der. This is a particular problem with critically illmale foals due to the resistance to passive urinationpresented by their long urethra. In the majority ofthese cases umbilical or urachal infection is not theprimary cause. 4. Treatment of Patent Urachus Many cases of simple patent urachus identied inotherwise-healthy and -active foals that are not as-sociated with umbilical remnant infection do notrequire specic treatment and will resolve with timeand activity, generally within 1-3 days followingbirth. 18Local treatment in these cases includes keeping the area clean and dry and the use of emol- lients to provide a moisture barrier to prevent urinescalding in wet affected areas. A similar approachshould be considered in cases of mechanical patenturachus. In both instances broad-spectrum anti-microbial therapy may be considered, particularlyantimicrobials that are concentrated in the urinesuch as trimethoprim-sulfa combination antimicro-bial drugs. Antimicrobial drugs with potential fornephrotoxicity (aminoglycosides, oxytetracycline)should be avoided if possible in these cases. Ultra- sonographic examination of the umbilical remnantshould be undertaken and repeated frequently, dailyif possible, to monitor for potential infection or de-velopment of uroperitoneum until the problem isresolved in all cases of patent urachus. Mechanical patent urachus associated with ura- chal urinary tractmucosal anesthetic agent. The dye will turn theurine orange and the urine will stain/dye anything itcomes in contact with. This treatment alleviatessymptoms but is not curative. Again, frequent(daily if possible) evaluation of the umbilical rem-nant using ultrasonographic examination should beperformed. Mechanical patent urachus secondaryto meconium impaction or other causes of abdominalstraining may be treated similarly. Patent urachus secondary to umbilical remnant infection will commonly respond to medical manage-ment, administration of broad-spectrum antimicro-bial drugs, and close monitoring. A swab of thestump may be taken for bacterial culture and sensi-tivity testing but may be more representative oflocal contamination than the culprit. A blood cul-ture may also be obtained but, again, might not berepresentative of the offending microbe(s). Empir-ical anti-microbial treatment should be started im-mediately following assessment with initial choicesfor treatment including a /H9252-lactam and an amino- glycoside. Renal function should be closely moni-tored, at least every other day, if aminoglycosidetreatment is chosen, with attention paid to the nor-mally decreasing creatinine concentrations duringthe rst 1-3 days of life. Alterations (increases) inrenal indices such as creatinine and blood urea ni-trogen (BUN) suggest that aminoglycoside treat-ment should be altered or abandoned. If progressis being made based on clinical and ultrasono-graphic assessment medical management may becontinued. Should medical management fail toresult in relatively rapid improvement (signs ofimprovement being repeated ultasonograhic ex-aminations showing rst lack of progression over1-3 days then improvement and decreasing signs ofinfection/inflammation such as lack of fever and sta-bilizing or decreasing brinogen concentration overthe following 2-3 d) surgical resection of the umbil-ical remnant should be considered. Uncontrolledor severe infections may rarely result in adhesionformation between abdominal contents and the in-fected internal umbilical remnant and should beconsidered a potential indication for surgical inter-vention if noted during ultrasonographic examina-tion. Successful medical management mightrequire 2-3 weeks of treatment but avoids the needfor general anesthesia in a compromised foal. associated crit- ical illness or prolonged recumbency is similar tothat of simple or mechanical patent urachus. Care-ful attention to umbilical stump hygiene is impor-tant in these cases. Foals affected by critical illnessare generally receiving broad-spectum antimicrobialtreatment and adjustments to treatment based onthe development of patent urachus are generally notnecessary. As with other causes of patent urachus,frequent, generally daily, assessment of the internalumbilical remnant for progressive evidence of un-controlled infection is paramount, as is monitoringfor the development of uroperitoneum. Urachal pa-tency generally resolves as the foal becomes moreactive, stands more frequently, and begins to uri-nate in a normal standing position without addi-tional specic treatment. 5. Discussion Patent urachus is not uncommon in neonatal foalsand frequently resolves spontaneously or with lim-ited specic treatment, including umbilical remnanthygiene. The use of silver nitrate or concentratediodine solutions to cauterize the urachus is no longerrecommended due to the potential for local necrosissupporting local bacterial infection of the area thatcould extend to the internal umbilical remnant.In cases where patent urachus is associated withinternal umbilical remnant infection medical treat-ment is initially indicated and frequently successful.Surgical solutions should be reserved for cases inwhich medical management has either failed, evi-denced by continued progression of infection basedon ultrasonographic, clinical and clinical pathologicexaminations, or has not resulted in sufcient prog-ress toward resolution, particularly in critically illfoals in which general anesthesia might furthercompromise the foal.

Discussion Atropine sulfate, topically administered to theeye, is the treatment of choice to minimize painand prevent complications leading to blindness.The purpose of this study was to determine theeffects of topical atropine sulfate (1% ophthalmicsolution) administered to the eye on GI motilityand transit time in healthy adult horses. Sixclinically healthy adult light-breed horses freefrom ocular disease were housed in stalls and ac- climated to a diet of hay and grain for 2 weeksprior to starting the study. The study was per-formed as a 2 /H110032 crossover design in which all horses either received saline (control) or atropinesulfate (1% ophthalmic solution, 2 mg, intraocular(IO), every 6 h) administered through a subpalpe-bral lavage system for 2 weeks. The horses un-derwent a 2-week washout between treatmentperiods. GI sounds were counted for 2 minutesfour times daily and a clinical score (0-3) was recorded. Abdominal ultrasound was performedon days 6 and 13 to assess contractile motility.The percentage of colored beads collected 96 hafter administered via nasogastric tube on days 4and 11 was used to evaluate progressive motility.Two of 6 atropine-treated horses showed clinicalsigns of colic.

Introduction Thrombocytopenia is not well studied in foals. Thehypothesis was that thrombocytopenia is associatedwith decreased survival. 2. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective review. The medical da-tabase at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital,University of California-Davis was searched toidentify foals age /H1134914 thrombocytopenia (1998-2015). Case foals were designated into fourgroups based on thrombocytopenia:(Group 1, 80,000-99,999/ 4, /H1102120,000/ Foals admitted just before and after each case foal were selected as controls. Mortalityrates were compared using Fisher's exact test. 3. Results A total of 133 foals with thrombocytopenia were in thrombocytopenic foals was higher than incontrols (P /H11021.0001; OR, 3.38 [2.06-5.56]). Within thrombocytopenic foals, mortality rates were 26.2,48.9, 46.2, and 16.7%, respectively in Groups 1-4. Group 2 foals had a higher mortality rate ( P/H11005.049), whereas Group 4 foals had a lower mortality rate ( P/H11005 .037). This was likely associated with the prevalenceof diagnoses among groups, given that more Group 4foals had suspected alloimmune thrombocytopeniaand more Group 2 foals had sepsis. Infectious suspected 9.8%. 4. Discussion Thrombocytopenia is common in hospitalized foalsand is associated with increased mortality. Infec-tious and alloimmune disorders were common.

Introduction Serum amyloid A (SAA) in synovial fluid has shownto increase in horses with septic arthritis. The ob-jective of this study was to evaluate SAA in jointsafter inducing systemic inflammation using alaminitis-model. The second objective was to com-pare SAA in synovial fluid of horses with inducedsystemic inflammation to SAA from horses with nat-urally occurring septic arthritis. 2. Materials and Methods Systemic inflammation was induced in six adulthorses using a laminitis oligofructose model. Syno-vial fluid-SAA concentration of middle carpal andtarsocrural joints was determined at 0, 24, and 48hours. Systemic-SAA concentration was deter-mined at the same time points. Synovial fluid-SAA concentration was compared between three groups of horses: Group 1 (control),Group 2 (systemic-inflammation), and Group 3 (septic arthritis). Data were analyzed by non-parametricstatistics and signicance set at P/H11021.05. 3. Results Systemic-SAA concentration was increased from baseline at 24 and 48 hours ( P/H11021.0001). Synovial fluid-SAA concentration signicantly increasedfrom baseline at 48 /H11021.0001). There was no signicant difference in synovial fluid-SAA concentration between horses with sys-temic inflammation and horses with septic arthritis(P/H11005.268). 4. Discussion Synovial fluid-SAA signicantly increased in joints after inducing systemic inflammation at 48 hours.SAA in synovial fluid of horses with systemic inflam-mation had values comparable to those of horseswith septic arthritis. 500 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENT Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding authorNOTESAcknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Authors have adhered to the Principles of theVeterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Authors declare no conflicts of interest.Funding Source Funding was provided by Mark and Pat duMont Equine Orthopedic Research Fund.

Meropenem, a carbapenem-class drug, isa time-dependent, broad-spectrum, bactericidaldrug that has minimal reported resistance. Theobjectives of this study were to determine the syno-vial fluid concentrations of meropenem followingIVRLP and to evaluate clinical adverse effects (e.g.,lameness, injection site swelling). 2. Materials and Methods Ten healthy horses received 500 mg of meropenemdiluted in 20 mL of saline via forelimb IVRLP.Radiocarpal joint synovial fluid and serum werecollected at 0, 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and18 h following IVRLP. Meropenem concentra-tions were determined using a microbiologicalbioassay.3. Results Mean time to peak synovial fluid concentrations was 0.5 h post IVRLP. Synovial fluid concentrationswere variable with a mean of 23.47 mcg/mL (range,0.77-75.46 mcg/mL). The mean time above 1 mcg/mL, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)breakpoint for most pathogens, was 4.3 h. concentration was1.72 mcg/mL (range, 0-2.85 mcg/mL). Mero-penem was well tolerated with only mild swellingat the injection site in some horses. 4. Discussion Meropenem is a novel antimicrobial for use in IVRLP. It achieves clinically signicant synovialfluid concentrations above the MIC for commonequine pathogens for at least 4 hours. MeropenemIVRLP is a safe, well-tolerated, therapeutic inhorses that could be considered where resistance isan issue and other antibiotics have failed. 502 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: LIFE STAGE MANAGEMENT Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding authorNOTESAcknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Authors have adhered to the Principles of theVeterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of Interest The Authors declare no conflicts of interest.

These can include any-thing from primary bacterial sinusitis to sinus cysts,sinusitis secondary to dental disease, neoplasia, orinspissated pus within the sinuses due to long-standing infection. The vast majority of these arediagnosed based on clinical signs and radiographicndings, and treatment most often consists of sys-temic antibiotics with or without sinus lavage viasinus trephination. Horses that fail to respond tothis approach are frequently referred to a tertiary-care facility for further diagnostics and treatment.Diagnostics and treatment at the referral center caninclude a host of advanced imaging modalities andsurgical intervention. Endoscopic ofthe equine paranasal sinus cavity with aflexible endoscope in the standing horse has beendescribed previously. 1,2This technique is rapidly gaining popularity at academic teaching hospitalsand specialty private practices. In our experience,however, this technique is not widely used amonggeneral practitioners although the majority of general practitioners have the necessary equip-ment (flexible endoscope) to perform this procedure.Given the simplicity of this procedure and the factthat this procedure could enable the general practi-tioner to more accurately diagnose and treat para-nasal sinus disease of the horse, we believe that thistechnique could be more widely adopted among gen-eral practitioners to improve their ability to appro-priately diagnose and treat a host of sinus disordersin horses. Therefore the objectives of this \"how to\"are to 1) demonstrate to general practitioners thesimplicity of this procedure, and 2) discuss the indi-cations and advantages of this technique over othermore traditional approaches. We believe this infor-mation will equip the equine practitioner with anadditional tool in their repertoire to successfullymanage a number of paranasal sinus disorders inhorses. 2. Materials and Methods Sinoscopy is performed with the horse sedated andrestrained in a set of stocks or similar restraint aswould be typically used for a dental procedure.Sedation can be accomplished through any numberof approaches well-reviewed by Vigani et al., 3but for 506 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSE NOTESthe general practice setting we have found IV HCL a(0.01-0.02 mg/kg) and morphine sulfateb(0.2-0.4 mg/kg) to be simple and effective and is given once and then thereafter as needed to effect. We have found the trephina-tion site in the frontal sinus to be the most usefulgiven that it allows direct access and visualization ofthe frontal, dorsal conchal, and caudal via fenestration of of the frontal sinus has been described previously.5 Briefly, the trephine is centered 60% of the distancefrom midline to the medial canthus and 0.5 cm cau-dal to a line connecting both medial canthi. Anarea surrounding the trephination location isclipped and prepped in a routine manner. Al-though specic nerve blocks to provide local anes-thesia to the part of the skull to be entered havebeen described, we have found local inltration of5-10 mL of mepivicaine csubcutaneously at the planned site of trephination to be effective and sim-ple (Fig. 1). 6A C-shaped incision is then made centered around the trephine hole with the base of the 'C' located axially (Fig. 2). A linear incisioncentered over the planned site of trephination is alsoacceptable. The incision is made to the underlyingbone and the resulting flap, including the perios-teum, is dissected off the bone with a periostealelevator or scalpel (Fig. 3). The trephine hole isthen made, while protecting the flap, with either ahandheld gault trephine or a sterile hole-saw and aportable drill, both of which are available at localhardware stores (Fig. 4).

Al-though a rigid arthroscope can be used, a flexible endoscope is more widely available and provides asuperior examination of the paranasal sinus cav-ities because of the ability to navigate aroundstructures within the sinus cavities (Fig. 5). 7 Following formation of the trephine hole, 60 mL of mepivicainecis applied topically throughout the ex - posed sinus cavity prior to examination to decreasesensation during intrasinus manipulations. Theexact procedure from this point forward depends onthe exact disease within that specic sinus cavity.Typical manipulations include a complete explora-tion of the exposed sinuses taking note of tooth rootsin the caudal maxillary sinus, sinus lining through-out the sinuses, and accumulation of abnormal fluidor masses. The ethmoid turbinates are clearly typically identied axial to the infraor-bital canal, although portions can be located abaxi-ally as well. In cases of suspected infection thisbulla is easily removed with sponge forceps or ron-geurs allowing removal of inspissated pus and la-vage of the infected area (Fig. 6). The rostralmaxillary sinus is located abaxially to the infraor-bital canal and just rostral to the caudal maxillarysinus. Removal of the septum between these si-nuses can improve visualization and drainage of therostral maxillary sinus. Any abnormal tissues canbe biopsied and samples taken for culture andsensitivity. Sinus cysts can be visualized and di- agnosed by this approach, and in select casesoccasionally removed. Similarly, small ethmoidhematomas located in the sinuses can be identiedand diagnosed and the occasional hematoma may beamenable to either removal or intra-lesional injec- Fig. 4.

Again the exact procedureperformed will depend upon the disease present atthe time of surgery. Closure is easily accomplishedby suture of the periosteum and skin or simply skinstaples. The author prefers skin staples becausethis allows easy re-entry should the need arise forcontinued therapy (i.e., sinus lavage due to infec-tion) or for repeat sinoscopy if hemorrhage has pre-vented a complete examination at the time of theinitial surgery. It is worth mentioning that sinoscopy can be per- formed directly into both the rostral and caudalmaxillary sinuses (Fig. 7). The trephination sitefor ventral medial canthus. maxillary sinus is 40% of thedistance from the rostral end of the facial crest to thelevel of the medial canthus and 1 cm ventral linejoining the infraorbital foramen to the medial can-thus. These direct approaches may be indicatedwhen visualization of only that part of the sinus isrequired. These approaches may be benecial andprovide direct access to specic structures (i.e., toothroots) but limit ability to examine the entire para-nasal sinus cavity, which is afforded by an approachto the frontal sinus. We have performed this procedure on 25 horses in the past 3 years as the sole means of either diagnosisand treatment (six horses) or as the sole means oftreatment (19 horses). In addition to these 25horses we have performed standing sinoscopy inconjunction with a more traditional sinusotomy insix horses. This was performed to re-evaluate theinitial lesion or treat recurrence of the initial lesion(i.e., return of previously treated ethmoid hema-toma) in four horses or in two horses sinoscopicevaluation of the sinus conrmed that the best de-nitive surgical approach was a traditional sinuso-tomy because of horse temperament (one horse) orsize and location of a neoplasm (one horse). In allhorses there were no surgical or postoperative com-plications related to the surgery although 11 horsesrequired at least one more sinoscopy at a later dateto treat recurrence of the original lesion. Of the 25horses in which this was the sole surgical procedureperformed, 16 were either primary or secondary bac- terial sinusitis with inspissated pus in paranasal sinus cysts, twowere ethmoid hematomas located in the sinus cav-ity, and two were bone sequestra within the sinuses.The ve paranasal sinus cyst cases treated in thismanner were small cysts easily visualized and com-pletely removed via sinoscopy. This approach wasnot considered for larger, incompletely visualizedcysts. Similarly, the two cases of ethmoid hemato-mas treated in this manner were small extensions ofnasally located hematomas that extended into thesinus cavity and were removed and the attachmentsinjected with formalin. In all ve cases of sinuscysts and both of these small ethmoid hematomasone surgical intervention was all that was requiredand at the time of follow-up there was no evidence ofrecurrence. Sinoscopy using a flexible endoscope or rigid ar- throscope in the standing sedated horse is techni-cally simple to perform and requires virtually nospecialized equipment that the majority of equinepractitioners do not already own. Due to the highprevalence of sinus disease in horses the ability toperform this technique will add a useful skill set tothe general equine practitioner and increase theirability to diagnose and treat paranasal sinus diseasein horses. Although this technique will not replaceother, more advanced imaging modalities or moreinvasive surgical intervention, it does, however, pro-vide the general practitioner with an additional toolto evaluate and treat horses with paranasal sinusdisease. There are minimal complications of sinos-copy and the cost of this procedure will vary butbecause of lack of need for additional equipment thecost will not be high resulting in increased ability forpractitioners to successfully diagnose and treat si-nus disease in horses.

The objective of this study was to determinerisk factors for the development of PEAL in NorthAmerica. 2. Materials and Methods This case-control study was performed in NorthAmerica from 2012 to 2015. Participating veteri-narians provided data from an index case of PEALand two control populations, a healthy horse and alame horse. Data from affected and unaffectedhorses were compared by use of conditional logisticregression analysis. 3. Results A total of 199 horses with acute, incident PEAL, 198healthy controls, and 153 lameness controls wereincluded. Horses with an obese body conditionscore (BCS /H113507), generalized and/or regional adipos- ity, a historic diagnosis of an endocrinopathy, andrecent glucocorticoid administration were at an in- creased odds of developing PEAL. 4. Discussion This study provided important information aboutthe risk of PEAL in horses in North America. Earlyidentication of horses at risk of obesity and/or en-docrinologic disease may be important factors inreducing the burden of PEAL.

Introduction Dietary manipulation is a particularly attractive andeffective means to manage many muscle disorders inequine athletes. Exertional such as poly-saccharide recurrentexertional (RER) improve with spe-cic diet and exercise regimes. 1-4Owners usually want a simple one size-ts-all strategy; the \"one poundof fat a day regime.\" However, this approach does not work for the range of equine athletes veterinariansencounter in practice. The recommended amount ofnonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) and fat for horseswith exertional myopathies is provided as a proportionof daily caloric intake (digestible energy). This briefhow-to paper is designed to assist practitioners in con-verting percent digestible energy to the amount ofNSC and fat to feed horses with myopathies. A com-prehensive review of feeding and exercise regimes forexertional myopathies can be found at Valberg et al,2012. 5In the examples provided in this how-to paper ballpark gures for nutrient content of hay and con-centrates are used and two 500-kg horses, one withPSSM and one with RER, are used. In reality, ahorse's weight will vary and should be accurately es-timated, hay should be analyzed for nutrients, feedmanufacturers contacted to obtain the exact content oftheir feeds, and a professional nutritionist consulted toproperly balance the ration. In addition, dietarychanges must go hand in hand with an exercise pro-gram because changing diet without regular exercisewill not produce the desired level of improvement in the exercise tolerance of horses with exertionalmyopathies. 2. Determining Calorie Intake and NSC Content The principle dietary recommendation for exertionalmyopathies in horses is to decrease NSC content andincrease fat content. For horses with PSSM theNSC target is to provide 10-15% of the total caloriesin the diet as NSC and the target for RER /H1102120% of the total calories in the diet provided as NSC. 1,2 The target for fat content for PSSM horses is 10-15% of daily calories supplied as fat and for horseswith RER 10-20% of daily calories or greater sup-plied as fat if needed to maintain weight. 1,2 Caloric Intake Calculations of caloric needs factor in body conditionscores, intended level of use, and hard/easy keeperstatus and are measured in megacalories (MCal).The commonly used for humans isactually A 500-kg easy-keeping exercise (45 of walk trot canter, 4d/wk) may need 18 MCal/day and an athletic hardkeeper in full work 35 MCal/day d/wk). NSC Content Water-soluble sugar (largely from hay) and starch (largely from concentrate) are both components ofNSC content. 520 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSE NOTESEasy Keeper With PSSMTarget NSC content /H1134915% of daily caloric 15%/H1100318 MCal/day /H110052.7 MCal/day A conversion factor for to is used: 2.7 MCal /H110031 g NSC/0.004 MCal /H11005 675 g NSC/day Hard Keeper With RER Target NSC content /H1134920% of daily caloric intake. g of NSC/day Note the wide margin of difference in the amount of NSC tolerated by horses with PSSM and RER de-pending on their underlying caloric intake. 3. Selecting a Forage Calories An average hay provides 2 MCal/kg and in theseexamples will be fed at 1.5% of 500 kg body weight. 1.5% of 500 kg /H110057.5 kg of hay Calories provided by hay: 7.5 kg hay /H110032 MCal/kg /H1100515 MCal/day Easy Keeper With PSSM The easy-keeping 18 MCal/day horse would have 3 additional MCal that could be provided in a concen-trate or oil. Hard Keeper With RER The hard-keeping Thoroughbred with RER requires 15 additional MCal/day. 4. NSC Content of Forage Hay is by weight the largest component of a horse'sdiet, a major source of sugar, and therefore the NSCcontent of hay affects the total NSC in the diet.The only way to know the NSC content of hay is toperform a nutritional analysis. Research has de-ned an upper limit for NSC in hay for PSSM horsesof 12% NSC by weight of the hay to avoid an insulinresponse. Consuming hay with 11% or lower NSCdoes not produce a signicant insulin response. 4 Insulin stimulates glycogen synthase 1, the overac-tive enzyme responsible for type 1 PSSM. Hay usu-ally has less than 3% fat by weight. NSC provided by 7.5 kg of 11% NSC hay 7.5 kg hay /H1100311% NSC /H11005825 g The easy keeper with PSSM has exceeded the target NSC (675 g) with this amount of hay. A lower-NSChay or a lesser amount of hay may be required. The hard keeper with RER is under the target NSC (1750 g NSC target) and has 925 additional g of NSCthat can be provided by a concentrate or more hay orhay with a higher NSC.5. Adding Fat Serum creatine kinase (CK) activity in horses withPSSM or RER declines signicantly when horses arefed a variety of natural oils or feeds containing ricebran. 1,2One type of fat has not been shown to be benecial over another in short-term feeding trials of horses with PSSM or RER with the exception ofshort-chain, odd-carbon, synthetic fats, which causeexcessive increases in insulin and serumCK. 6Such odd-carbon fats are not commercially available in any feeds or supplements. Easy Keeper With PSSM Fat is calorie dense (1 g provides 0.009 MCal) and can readily cause weight gain in easy-keeping PSSMhorses. For an overweight PSSM horse, fasting for6 hours before exercise rather than feeding fat is ameans to naturally increase needed serum-free fattyacids and avoid weight gain. Once a healthyweight is achieved, fat can be added to the diet.As horses increase their exercise intensity ownersoften must increase the amount of fat being fed orsigns of exercise intolerance return. At a normal body weight the target fat intake is 10% of daily calories for PSSM. 10% of 18 MCal/day caloric 1.8 MCal /H110031 g fat/0.009 /H11005200 g of fat Oils One cup of vegetable oil (223 g) would provide 2 MCal with no additional NSC This would provide 2 MCal/18 MCal /H11003100/H11005 11% of daily calories as fat, meeting the target. Rice Bran 0.75 kg (1.7 lbs) of a commercial rice bran ( /H110114 MCal/kg, 0.75 kg /H1100320% NSC /H11005150 g NSC, which when added to the 825 g provided by the hay furtherexceeds the target of 675 g NSC Thus, for an easy-keeping, fairly sedentary horses with PSSM, a straight fat supplement such as oil ora solidied fat may be a better choice than a high-fatconcentrate feed that contains additional NSC.This diet, however, would need a ration balancer toprovide additional vitamins, minerals, and aminoacids. The most common mistake owners make infeeding horses with PSSM is to select a concentratewith 10-20% fat by weight and feed a small amountto avoid weight gain. As can be seen in the aboveexample, feeding 1 lb (0.45 kg) of rice bran would AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 521HOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSEonly provide 90 g of fat, which would provide lessthan 5% of daily calories as fat.Hard Keeper With RERAt 35 MCal/day this horse could readily consumemore rice bran or a commercial 3.3 MCal/kg high-fatfeed (12.5% fat by weight) with a low NSC content(10% by weight). aOils alone are not usually a good choice for hard keepers given that it is often difcultto get a hard-keeping horse to consume the amountof oil needed to achieve a target of 15-20% dailycalories as fat. Using the commercial low-starch high-fat feed a 6 kg feed /H110033.3 concentrate /H1100115 MCal/day from hay /H1100535 MCal/day, which meets the daily target. 6 kg feed /H1100310% NSC /H11005600 g NSC The total NSC in the ration /H11005(600/H11001825 g from hay) /H110030.004 MCal/gram /H11003100/H1100516%, which meets the target of /H1102120% 6 kg feed /H1100312.5% fat /H11005600 g of the target of 15-20% These examples illustrate why it is not possible to recommend one amount of a high-fat low-starch feedfor exertional myopathies and why feeding pro-grams must be designed for each individual horsebased on the percentage of daily calories. There are numerous other very important factors that go into balancing a ration that are not discussedin this simplied context. Feeds are designed to bebalanced when fed at the manufacturer's recom-mended amounts. When owners feed less than therecommended amount, the ration will not be bal-anced for protein, vitamins, and minerals. A con-sultation with a nutritionist can address theseimbalances and aid in selecting from the many high-fat, low-starch and fat supplements currently avail-able from every major feed company. 6. Expectations The benecial effect of low-starch high-fat diets re-quire that horses be trained daily, which will en-hance enzymes involved in fat and glucosemetabolism. It is important to note that manyhorses with chronic forms of exertional rhabdomyol-ysis will always have an underlying predilection formuscle soreness and the best that can be performedis to manage horses to minimize clinical signs.With adherence to both the diet and exercise recom-mendations, 70-75% of Quarter Horses and Warm-bloods with PSSM show notable improvement inclinical signs and many return to acceptable levels of performance. 7,8There is, however, a wide range in the severity of clinical signs shown by horses with exertional myopathies; those horses with severe orrecurrent clinical signs will require more stringentadherence to diet and exercise recommendations toregain muscle function. PSSM horses that alsohave the mutation for malignant hyperthermia donot respond as well to diet and exercise recommen-dations and may continue to develop exertionalrhabdomyolysis with the possibility of a fatalepisode. 9 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Obesity is a common problem in horses and po-nies, especially in the so-called easy keepers.Local or general adiposity and insulin resistance,as well as a predisposition to laminitis, were re-cently described as equine metabolic syndrome. 1 Insulin resistance is either dened as resting in-sulin /H1102220 /H9262U/mL or by abnormal glycemic and insulinemic responses to glucose and/or insulinchallenges. In the insulin-resistant state, tissues such as skeletal muscle or adipose tissue do not properlyrespond to insulin, thereby causing a reactive re-sponse in insulin secretion by pancreatic /H9252-cells.2 General or regional obesity has been associated witha chronic state of inflammation and insulin resis-tance in humans 3and animal species such as the horse.4-8Beyond that, equine studies highlight obesity and insulin resistance as a main contribut-ing factor for developing laminitis and impaired re-production. 1,9,10Pony breeds seemed to be more predisposed to becoming insulin resistant and todeveloping laminitis than horse breeds. 9Because increased systemic inflammation is known to in-crease the risk for laminitis, obesity-associated in-sulin resistance and inflammation have beenhighlighted in the horse. 1,9,102. Effects of Diet on Obesity and Insulin Resistance In humans and animal species such as the horse, it is hypothesized that periodic postprandial hyper-insulinemia may promote the development of in-sulin resistance. 4,5The long-term feeding (from birth to weaning, 200 d) of a starch- and sugar-rich concentrate in Thoroughbred foals resultedin a decreased insulin sensitivity after weaningwhen compared with animals fed with a fat- andber-enriched concentrate. 5In Thoroughbred geldings, feeding a concentrate rich in sugar andstarch inconsistently affected insulin dynamicswhen compared to a concentrate rich in fat and ber; however, results were partly confounded bythe effects of body condition. 4In Standardbred horses, diets rich in starch and sugar have beenassociated with decreased insulin sensitivity andimpaired glucose tolerance within 6 weeks. 11,12 It is interesting to note that subsequent physical conditioning reversed the effect of diet on insulin sensitivity. Based on these studies, dietary strategies should be developed to lower insulin concentrations andimprove insulin sensitivity in the horse. Thesestrategies include diets 523HOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSE NOTES3. Energy Restriction Several studies have shown that progressive weightloss had signicantly improved insulin effectivenessin insulin-resistant ponies, highlighting the be-tween obesity and insulin resistance. 14,15,17 4. L-Carnitine Nutraceuticals such as L-carnitine or trace ele-ments, which may facilitate body weight (BW) lossor improve insulin sensitivity in humans, are ofinterest. However, Schmengler et al. 18showed no signicant advantage of L-carnitine supplementa-tion over placebo with respect to the metabolic pro-le during body weight reduction, suggesting thatendogenous L-carnitine synthesis is sufcient to fa-cilitate lipid and glucose metabolism in ponies. 5. Zinc Several studies in humans, rats, and mice have in-vestigated the role of zinc (Zn) status in the man-agement of insulin resistance. Zn seemed tostimulate insulin action by increased activities ofinsulin-independent glucose transporters and by animproved binding ability of insulin to its receptors. 19 Zn supplementation above recommendations mighthave some potential to improve glucose tolerance inhorses; however, further studies in horses areneeded. 6. Chromium Chromium (Cr) is an essential trace element that isinvolved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids,and proteins by amplifying the activity of insulin.In diabetic humans and rats, Cr supplementationhas been shown to increase the cellular uptake ofglucose and stimulate insulin metabolism. Inhorses with hyperinsulinemia, Cr supplementationfailed to alter glucose daily Cr dosage /H1101110 /H9262g/kg BW) was far below the humans (20 /H9262g/kg BW). Cr for 4 weeks improved glucosemetabolism in obese ponies and horses, suggestingthat Cr facilitated insulin signaling. 11However, it must be emphasized that the ponies and horses still had impaired glucose regulation as indicated by su-praphysiological glucose and insulin responses tothe starch tolerance test when compared withhealthy horses. 7. Iron In recent years, a number of reports in humans havedemonstrated a relationship between serum and to-tal body iron (Fe) reserves and the risk for type 2diabetes. 21It has been hypothesized that the for - mation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative tis-sue damage catalyzed by Fe contributes initially toinsulin resistance. 21Mechanisms underlying the relationship between Fe and diabetes are not fully understood and prospective studies in horses aremissing. Currently, it might be advisable to avoidFe supplementation in horses with equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). 8. Cinnamon In humans, contradicting results exist regarding theefcacy of supplementing cinnamon to the diet toimprove glucose tolerance. Lower doses of 1.5 gcinnamon per day ( /H1101118 mg/kg BW) did not improve glycemic control diabetes, 22whereas higher doses ( /H1102236 mg/kg BW) seemed to ameliorate glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabe-tes. 23In vitro studies suggest that cinnamon might increase the amount of proteins involved in insulin signaling and glucose transport. In horses,some compounded feed contains cinnamon; however,scientic data about dosing and potential effects arelacking. 9. Conclusion Obesity is a common problem in horses and ponies,especially in the so-called easy keepers. Obese an-imals are more predisposed to becoming insulin re-sistant and to developing laminitis than leananimals. Body weight reduction is one of the keyissues to improve metabolic abnormalities. How-ever, the effect of energy restriction to reduce bodyweight is not further enhanced by supplements suchas L-carnitine or chromium.

Forexample, SCFAs such as butyrate, acetate, and pro-pionic acid act synergistically with hydrochloric acidand induce similar effects by penetrating the mu-cosa, resulting in cellular inflammation as well asinteracting with the sodium transport system. 6 Furthermore, carbohydrate fermentation by gut mi-croflora produces lactic acid and induces increasedtissue permeability and secondary damage to theequine stomach mucosa. In contrast with the se-vere effect on human patients, Helicobacter pylori is only sporadically identied in the stomach of horseswith EGUS, thus, the role of this pathogen remainsunclear. 7 Risk factors, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflamma- tory drugs, high-grain diets, starvation periods for24 hours, stall connement with no access to pas-ture, and strenuous exercise or transport stresshave been identied to induce equine gastric ulcersyndrome. 2,4,5In foals, the weaning process is well known to induce gastric ulceration. Several studies have conrmed an improvement of healing gastric ulcers by administering drugs,such as omeprazole, 8cimetidine, and ranitidine.9 2. Feeding Management In addition to medical treatment, optimizing feedingand housing management is highly recommended.In exercising horses, grain intake should be limitedto a maximum o f 1 g starch per kg body weight per meal. 10,11Special attention should be spent on the forage intake. Forage should be provided ad libi- tum or at least fed to a daily minimum of 1.5-2% of body weight. The practice of feeding hay rst fol-lowed by grain leads to an optimal mixture of gastriccontent. 11In several studies, feeding alfalfa hay is reported to have a protective effect on gastric mu- 526 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSE NOTEScosa by buffering gastric pH due to its high contentsof calcium, magnesium, and protein. For example,feeding alfalfa hay combined with grain to six adulthorses over a period of 14 days increased pH ingastric juice over 2-5 hours after feeding. 12Fur- thermore, the number and severity of gastric muco-sal lesions located in the Pars nonglandularis weresignicantly lower compared with horses fed brome-grass hay. 12Lybbert13published similar results in 24 yearlings. In a crossover study, yearlings were either fed either costal Bermuda grass hay or alfalfahay over a period of 28 days with a 21-day washoutperiod. All horses underwent a moderate trainingprogram during the study. Only one of the 24horses fed alfalfa hay showed an increase in severityscore in contrast with 10 of 24 horses in the Ber-muda grass group. However, recent studies feed-ing alfalfa chaff failed to improve gastric mucosallesion scores in weanlings and adult horses. Infact, signicantly higher lesion scores in the pyloricregion were detected when feeding alfalfa chaff. 14 In this study 38, weanlings aged between 172-174days were randomly allocated to two forage feedinggroups: alfalfa chaff and hay. 14Gastroscopic ex - amination was performed immediately beforeweaning and after a feeding period of 15-16 days.Weaning induced gastric lesions at the major andminor curvatures of both Pars nonglandularis andPars glandularis in both forage groups. However, asignicantly higher number of lesions at the pyloruswere seen in the alfalfa chaff group only. Theseresults were conrmed in repletion trials in wean-ling as well as in adult horses. 15A possible expla - nation for the changes at the pylorus might be theharsh acanthous structure of alfalfa chaff that might cause mechanical injury at the pylorus. The pyloricregion is an area of the stomach with high motility.It is speculated that the movement of the alfalfa stemsmight excoriate the mucosa during passage. This ini-tial injury of the glandular mucosa might leave thepylorus more vulnerable to the insults of SCFAs, hy-drochloric acid, and/or bile salts. 3. Conclusion In conclusion, providing grass hay ad libitum or at least to a daily minimum of 1.5-2% of body weight,and a signicant reduction in starch intake can berecommended to prevent gastric ulceration. Freeaccess to pasture has been linked to the lowest inci-dence of gastric mucosa lesions.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Rapid growth requires the presence of adequateamounts of protein with balanced essential aminoacids and usable energy sources for soft tissue andskeletal growth: macro- and micro-minerals as thebuilding blocks for bone, tendons and ligaments and,to a lesser degree, vitamins as the cofactors in thegrowth process. Inadequate or imbalanced provi-sion of any of these will alter the developmentalprocesses, possibly to the detriment of the younghorse. The more rapid the rate of growth, the morecritical the balances become and more quickly nu-tritional errors will manifest. Although horses willcontinue to grow and acquire skeletal strength andsize for up to 6 years of age, after 12-18 months ofage the rate of growth is slow enough that there ismore tolerance of decits/excesses in the rations. 1 Traditionally it has been recommended that wean- lings receive 50-60% of their caloric needs in the formof a grain-based concentrate 1-3and that high protein (/H1102214% in total rations)2fed to rapidly growing horses will cause developmental orthopedic disease. Theseare myths. The facts are that since 2004 it has beenreported that even rapidly growing weanlings do aswell, if not better when fed predominantly forage-based rations with little to no grain-based concen-trates. 4-9In a series of experiments (2004-2006) we tested the hypothesis that rapidly growing draft cross weanlings (age 5-12 mo) could be fed forage-basedrations with little to no grain included, as long as thenutrient prole of the feed met or exceeded the Na-tional Research Council (NRC) 2,3recommendations. The objectives were to compare growth and develop- ment of draft cross weanlings fed either forage-basedtotal mixed-ration (TMR) cubes vs traditional 50:50forage:grain concentrate ration. 2. Materials and Methods Each autumn, 12 weanling draft/Quarter Horsecross weanlings were purchased from a ranch inNorth Dakota. After training and adaptation tothe conditions at our research facility, the horseswere paired according to body weight and assignedto one of two treatments. Treatment 1 was a tra-ditional ration consisting of 50% of the calories pro-vided from either a pelleted feed formulatedspecically for growth (Y) aor a pelleted feed formu - lated to meet or exceed requirements for all lifestages (SF) band free access to grass/legume mix hay. Treatment 2 consisted of horses that had free access to a forage-based total mixed-ration (TMR)cube formulated, based on forage analysis, to meetor exceed NRC recommendations for energy, protein, 528 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSE NOTEScalcium, and phosphorus intakes. In 2004 and 2005,the TMR contained 10% added grain, in 2006 the TMRhad 10% wheat bran added. The rations were fed tothe horses in feeders in their individual stalls, with theconcentrate divided into two feedings, morning andlate afternoon and the hay and TMR replenished onlyonce a day in the morning. The weight of the hay andTMR offered were recorded daily and leftovers wereremoved each morning and weighed. All horses hadaccess to white salt blocks and water at all times.They were turned out in a dry lot daily for exercise for5 to 6 hours with access to only salt and water. Theweanlings were weighed and measured weekly for thenext 4 months. 3. Results The nutrient proles of the rations given all 3 yearsare provided in Table 1. Weanlings fed the tradi-tional rations (Treatment 1) had average daily gains(ADG) that met or slightly exceeded the 0.8 kg/daypredicted by the NRC. Weanlings fed TMR (Treat-ment 2) had ADG that exceeded ( P/H110210.05) the gains of the traditionally fed horses (Fig. 1) even though theiractual intakes of feed were slightly lower. Therewere two incidences of developmental orthopedic dis- ease (DOD) in both 2005 and 2006 that were presentbefore the study was initiated. In 2005, two wean-lings had epiphysitis that resolved spontaneously dur-ing the trial period, one in each treatment group. In2006, one colt had bilateral stifle OCD lesions (treatedsurgically), one lly had mild flexural deformities thatdid not change during the experimental period. 4. Discussion There is increasing evidence that the previous recom-mendations 2,3that weanling horses must be fed ra - tions of 60%:40% grain-based concentrates:forage are wrong. Good-quality /H110220.6%, phosphorus be- tween 0.45% and 0.6%, low to no with ade-quate rainfall can support normal-to-high growthrates in weanling Thoroughbreds with minimal to noconcentrate supplementation. 4,9Even though the most recent NRC3and research performed by feed companies10,11suggest supplementing young horses with grain-based concentrates at the rate of 1-1.5% body weight ( /H1101150% of the total intake per day), Ral- ston al7,8and Kline5documented excellent growthTable 1.

The TMRrations were mixtures of specially collected grassesand alfalfa supplemented with mineral as needed,based on analyses of the forages used, to meet or ex-ceed nutrient requirements for rapidly growing horses.In the studies by Ralston et al 6-9the young draft cross horses fed the TMR rations consumed between 2.7- 3.1% of their body weights per day when fed freechoice. Kline 5restricted the TMR (60% alfalfa and 25% oats) intakes to 2.5% body weight and still got higher growth rates than predicted(1.69 kg/d) and no gastric ulcerations in Standardbredweanlings compared with those fed a typical 50% forage:50% grain ration (0.95 kg/d, gastric ulceration scoresbetween 0.5 and 3 in all periods of the experiment). It has been suggested that provision of moderate amounts of starch (20-30% non-structural carbohy-drates [NSC] in a concentrate) might actually improveinsulin sensitivity in young and adult horses and po-nies despite stimulation of higher but physiologic se-cretion of insulin to a standardized challenge; 10-12 however, it is obvious that high starch/sugar rations(/H1102230% NSC) are not necessary for good-quality growth and development in young horses. High-protein rations ( /H1102214-16% in total rations) were incriminated in the mid 1970s as a signicantcause of development of orthopedic diseases in rap-idly growing foals. 2resulting in a widespread belief that protein should be restricted to 14% or less in rapidly growing foals. However, numerous studiessince that time have repeatedly demonstrated thatas long as the mineral intake is adjusted to meet theneeds of the rapidly growing young horses, proteinintakes as higher as 20% caused no signicant prob-lems. 1,3,6It also seems that the amino acid balance of the protein fed to a weanling or yearling is impor- tant, with lysine and as amino acids. 1obtained ac - ceptable growth rates in weanling Thoroughbredsfed a ration of unspecied hay and 9% protein the 0.6% lysine and 0.4% threonine. However, theideal recommendation is that rapidly growing foalsbe fed rations that contain between 13 and 17%protein of good quality, preferably from legume (al-falfa or soybean meal) or milk-based sources. 1,3 5. Summary It is now apparent that high grain/starch rations arenot necessary for optimal growth in high-quality forages or forage-based feeds are avail-able. As long as the energy, protein, and mineralneeds of young, rapidly growing horses are met, opti-mum growth and development can be achieved with-out high starch and sugar content, which has beencorrelated with a higher incidence of gastric ulcer-ation. High-protein rations per se do not cause DOD. Protein quality (lysine and threonine content) is as, ifnot more, important than quantity. Legumes such asalfalfa and clover are excellent sources of high-qualityprotein and should be included in the rations of rapidlygrowing young horses.

The age at whichhorses are considered seniors or aged varies from 15to greater than 20 years of age. 1-3Typically, the author does not consider a horse to be a senior untilthey are in their 30s from observations of horsesremaining active and maintaining good conditionthrough their 20s. There is individual variationwith respect to the age at which special manage-ment is indicated. Owners in the United Statesand Australia report that less than 50% of theirsenior horses are retired. 2,3Of the nonretired se- nior horses in Australia, more than half worked amedian of 1 hour per day 3 days per week and mostwere reported to work at moderate intensity. 3In the United States, 10% of unretired senior horsesstill compete. 2 Age is a number, not a disease. However, there are conditions associated with advancing age inhorses such as colic, has been linked to alterations in insulin sensitivity or insulin resis-tance in horses and the subsequent hyperinsulin-emia increases the PPID horse's risk for laminitis. 2,7 However, Mastro and colleagues8reported that PPID in the senior horse (age 23-28 y) was notassociated with altered insulin sensitivity. Milddental abnormalities (points, hooks) do not warrantdiet change 9and feeding long-stem forage may be benecial in promoting even dental wear. How-ever, feed and feed form should be reevaluated if ahorse's dental disease is progressed such that thehorse quids to minimize feed losses and preventweight loss. Dietary considerations age-relatedconditions may be helpful in improving the qualityof life in the senior horse. Key Nutritional Factors for the Senior Water is the most important ingredient in anyhorse's ration and special attention should be givento the senior with altered mobility or specic pref-erence for water temperature. Dietary Dry Matter, Energy, and Macronutrients How much should you feed? This is a difcult ques-tion because it depends on the energy density of thefeeds available and what the horse is willing to eat.Activity influences energy requirements and activityis thought to decline with advancing age. The di-gestible energy (DE) requirements for seniors arenot known to be different than for adult horses. Forthe less or moderately active senior, DE require-ments may be 30.3 kcal (reduced) to 33.3 kcal (av-erage adult) per kg of horse. 10 Expected dry matter (DM) intake for the adult horse is 2% body weight in DM per day or 20 lb DMper 1000-lb horse. Commercial senior feeds and AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 531HOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSE NOTESsome byproduct feeds (i.e., brans) are more energydense than forages or other highly insoluble berbyproducts (Table 1). Although this is helpfulwhen managing the thin senior, keep in mind thatas the energy density of the ration increases, DMprovision will generally decrease. Furthermore, in-soluble ber, such as cellulose in forages, is slowlyfermented by gut microbes and supports a neutralhindgut pH and symbiotic gut microbiota. Grain byproducts (i.e., brans) have an inverse cal- cium:phosphorus ratio (Table 1). If presented witha thin senior that cannot properly masticate long-stem forage, consider a commercial senior feed (en-ergy dense and soft texture) and/or combining acubed or pelleted grass or alfalfa product. Gener-ally, the author's preference is not to feed alfalfa orcommercial products exclusively because these prod-ucts are highly fortied in calcium and protein, re-sulting in malodorous stalls and an increased riskfor enteroliths. Commercial concentrates such assenior feeds are more energy dense than forages(e.g., 1.2-1.5 Mcal/lb as fed), but are often formu-lated to be high in ber to enable them to be fedwithout forage in the diet. The author prefers tomaximize grass forage in the diet. Concentratesare generally higher in nonstructural carbohydratesthan forage, which also makes them less than idealfor feeding the PPID senior when insulin sensitivityis reduced. Alfalfa and grass cubes/pellets can becombined or oil (0.7g fat/kg body weight [BW]; e.g.,up to 1.6 cup soybean oil for an 1100-lb adult horse)may be added to soaked forage cubes/pellets to en-hance the energy density of a ration. 10 In addition to calories, it is important to ensure that daily protein requirements are being met.Average adult horse crude protein requirements are1.26 g protein per BW in kilograms. 10Generally, if the forage meets an adult's energy requirements, it likely also meets protein requirements. The moreenergy dense the ration, the lower the total DMintake, and the higher the protein concentrationneeds to be for the horse to consume adequate pro-tein. For example, if feeding a ration with 0.8 Mcal/lb DM, 1.7% BW in total DM is needed to meetminimum adult maintenance DE requirements(30.3 Mcal/kg BW). 10At this level of intake, the diet would need to contain 7.4% crude protein (CP) DM to meet adult average crude protein require-ments (1.26g CP/kg BW). 10Conversely, if feeding a ration with 1.0 Mcal/lb DM, only 1.4% BW in total DM is needed to meet minimum adult maintenanceDE requirements and the ration would need to con-tain 9.0% crude protein DM to meet adult averagecrude protein requirements. Feeding an en-hanced-protein diet may help improve musclemass in the active senior horse. 11 Essential fatty acid requirements of seniors, or any adult horse, is unknown.10Fatty acids are highly bioavailable and supplementing or enhancing dietary fat will increase the energy density of theration, which is helpful for seniors that have dif-culty consuming enough feed to meet energy re-quirements.

Although the evidence in fa-vor of enhancing dietary EPA and DHA in a senior'sdiet is weak, omega-3s are generally safe.

Commercialequine omega-3 products tend to be flavored to en-hance palatability; however, some horses will read-ily consume soft gels when mixed with feeds orsoaked forage. Nutraceuticals Nutraceuticals are numerous, under-regulated, andunderstudied. Nutraceuticals often do not containwhat the label states and may even contain mole-cules/compounds not stated on the label. 16,17Evi- dence of third-party auditing of products and/ormanufacturing facilities, such as with U.S. Phar-macopoeial Convention or National Animal Supple-ment Council, can provide some peace of mind withregard to the product content actually aligning withthe label and production quality control. Peer re-viewed published, ideally blinded placebo control,studies provide evidence of efcacy and safety. For equine joint nutraceuticals, there is some published work. Glucosamine has in vitro anti-inflammatory effects on equine chondrocytes andsynoviocytes. 18However, oral bioavailability is low19and does not seem to improve mobility in se - nior horses.20Avocado and soybean unsaponi - ables may help protect articular cartilage, but thistoo does not seem to positively influence mobility inhorses. 21 A combination of green-lipped muscle, abalone, and shark cartilage reduced joint inflammation inhorses with experimentally induced synovitis. 22 Green-lipped muscle (25mg/kg BW/d for 56 d) im-proved mobility in New Zealand fetlockosteoarthritis. 23Cayzer and colleagues23con- ducted the double-blinded 67, 63, and 61% of supplementedhorses improved by 1 or more scores in flexion, lame-ness, and pain, respectively. In that study, 40, 35,and 15% of placebo horses also improved by 1 ormore scores in flexion, pain, and lameness,respectively. 23 For PPID, chasteberry has been evaluated as a nutraceutical for PPID horses, but the evidence ofefcacy is questionable. 6,24,25 If an owner wants to try a joint nutraceutical, the author suggests that the veterinarian informs theowner that neutraceuticals are poorly regulated andresearched and to purchase products diplaying theU.S. Pharmacopoeial Convention or National Ani-mal Supplement Council seal. Balancing the Diet Ideally, the goal is to maximize forage, especiallygrass, in any horse's diet. Therefore, the author'sgeneral approach to balancing a forage-based seniorration is to either balancer pellet. The latter provides asubstrate to top dress oral medications on. Whenfeeding a high rate of a fortied commercial seniorfeed, vitamin/mineral supplementation is notneeded. In general, a horse would need to consume at least 0.5%, and sometimes more than 1% of bodyweight per day (i.e., at least 5-10 lb of concentrate/dfor a 1000-lb horse) in a fortied concentrate (i.e.,commercial senior feed) in order to avoid the need tofurther trace mineral supplementation. However,keep in mind, this is a general rule of thumb and willnot apply across all concentrates given that differentproducts have different concentrations of vitaminsand minerals. Feeding Management How you feed is as important as, if not more impor-tant than, what you feed. For the senior with re-duced mobility, consider height of water and feedbuckets/troughs and distance between feed, water,and shelter. 26Strategies to eliminate any negative effects of competition should be implemented. Objective(s) The objective of this \"how to\" is to highlight that grass forage can be the main-stay of the seniorration, even if the forage form needs to bealtered/softened. 2. Materials and Methods A retrospective analysis of data from our equineteaching herd, since 2008, was conducted. Theteaching herd consists of /H1101120 mares of various breeds maintained on cool-season pasture in groupsof 4-7 by body condition score (BCS), with a consid-eration for social dynamics. The herd is evaluatedby the author 4-6 times per year. Rations are builtusing ideal body weight, adult maintenance nutrientrequirements, 10and forage quality (see Determin - ing Forage Quality below). For the underweighthorse, the author set target BCS to 6/9; for over-weight horses, target BCS at 5/9. The author cal-culated ideal body weight based on the generalassumption that each BCS point on a 9-point scalerepresents approximately 50 lb body weight for a\"full-size\" 1000-lb /H11006pound horse. The 50 lb per BCS rule doesn't apply to all horses, but is a place tostart. Cool-season grass hay was fed when pasture for- age is inadequate. Digestible energy requirementswere calculated as 30.3kcal/kg ideal body weight foroverweight horses and 33.3 kcal/kg ideal bodyweight for underweight/ideal BCS horses. Theamount of grass hay fed was based on energy calcu-lations. In general, 1.5% BW of an average qualitygrass hay (0.9Mcal/lb DM) will meet the mainte-nance requirements for adult horses. Forage wasbalanced with a granular low-sodium vitamin-min-eral product. This product was generally availablefree choice with a minimum target to meet tracemineral and vitamin E requirements for each horse.Horses that lost condition in the winter ( /H110215/9) were fed a commercially available low starch senior feed(1.5 Mcal/lb as fed). Free-choice white salt is added AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 533HOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSEin the summer. Water was available by fence lineautomatic waterers. Complete BCS and management records from ve senior mares are represented (Fig. 1). Of our ve senior mares, only one (Annie) was thin. The other four senior mares ranged fromideal to obese, with the highest BCS in the fall.KK had tremendous regional fat deposits, especiallyin the summer months. Fancy had an episode ofacute laminitis April 2010. Broadly, the number ofobese horses has declined in this herd since theauthor began managing this herd. Grazing muz-zles were instituted the summer of 2012. Before2012, our only means to control BCS was to takeadvantage of the winter months of control-feedinghay. The winter 2009 grass hay was of poor quality (0.78 Mcal/lb as fed [AF]; 70% neutral detergentber [NDF] DM) and BCS was lowest for the vesenior mares over this winter. Herd care staff in-creased the hay offered from the original recommen-dations and observed a high rate of forage waste(roughly 30% or more). The winter 2010 grass during the 2009 and winters.The same moderate-poor quality hay (0.82 Mcal/lbAF; 67% NDF group; Annie was not fed a senioror supplemental feed during the 2011 winter. Adifferent moderate-poor quality hay (0.80 Mcal/lbAF; 67% NDF DM) was fed during the 2012 winterand Annie was supplemented again with seniorfeed.Determining Forage Quality Stage of plant maturity is the single most influential factor on forage quality. There are numerous otherfactors (i.e., sun, rain, temperature, soil fertility)that also influence forage growth and thus quality.Forage quality can be estimated using olfactory, vi-sual, and tactile senses such as assessing smell (i.e.,moldy, fresh), leaf:stem ratio, presence of seedheads, color and texture. A hay with a low leaf:stem ratio and presence of seed heads is more ma-ture and likely to be of poorer quality. Conversely,hay with a high leaf:stem ratio will be softer andhave greater nutritional value (i.e., protein, in-creased digestibility). Hay should also be free ofmold (black spots) and foreign debris (sticks, leaves).Hay should be green in color and have a fresh, pleas-ant aroma (not moldy). The most accurate way todetermine forage quality is to evaluate a chemicalnutrient analysis of the forage. Dried forage (hay) is most commonly sampled, but fresh forage (i.e., grass pasture) can be sampled andanalyzed as well. For hay (grass or alfalfa hay), 10representative bales (or 10%) from each batchshould be sampled with a hay corer. You can eitherborrow a hay corer from your local extension ofce orask to have an extension agent come to your farm tosample the hay. Check with the forage laboratoryregarding sample submission; generally, hay shouldbe shipped dry and fresh forage should be shippedon ice. Select an analysis that provides, at mini-mum, DE, crude protein (CP), and neutral detergentber (NDF). When assessing forage quality, the author consid- ers the parts of the plant cell, the cell wall, and the Fig. 1. BCS data of the ve seniors from 2008-2012. Senior mares are listed by name (breed year of birth). 534 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSEcell contents. The cell wall serves as the skeletonfor the plant and as forage matures, the cell wall tocell content ratio increases. As plant biomass in-creases, quality decreases. A forage quality analy-sis should include analyses of DE, CP, and NDF.NDF represents the forage cell wall. More speci-cally, NDF represents cellulose, lignin, and hemicel-lulose. This fraction is used as a positive indicatorof forage bulk. Therefore, the higher the NDF themore bulky the hay and the less a horse is willing toconsume. The author generally prefers forage NDF less than 70% DM basis for horses. As for-age matures, DE and CP generally decreaseswhile NDF increases. 3. Results The author recommends monitoring BW and BCSmonthly. The herd care staff checked the maresbetween our evaluations and would notify the au-thor of horses less than 5/9 or greater than 6/9.The general goals and expectations of managing thesenior horses were to achieve and/or maintain a BCSof 5-6/9. The rst winter (2011) Annie did notrequire a senior feed to maintain a BCS 5/9 through-out most of the winter. Forage quality determinesthe need for concentrate. 4. Discussion Age is not a disease and not all seniors need aspecial ration. If the senior is in good condition(BCS 5-6/9), is clinically healthy, and the ration isproperly fortied, then there is no indication tochange the ration. Furthermore, when reachingfor special feeds and supplements marketed to thesenior horse, do not forget about the basics. Themost common cause of death for horses greater than15 years of age is disease of the gastrointestinal (GI)tract. 5Although the cause of GI disease is broad, diet and feeding management is a signicant factor that influences a horse's risk of GI disease. Theauthor suggests starting with the forage (pasture,long-stem, cubes, pellets) and building the ration upfrom there. Feeding a good-quality forage can re-duce or prevent the need for commercial concen-trates. When more energy is needed, there areseveral commercial senior feeds, formulated as rel-atively high-ber complete feeds, to choose from.When in doubt, contact our Nutrition Service,vetnutrition@vt.edu; 540-231-1775 (phone); 540-231-6448 (fax).

Remillard, PhD, DVM, DACVN Author's address: Veterinary e-mail: rremillard@att.net Homeless\" \"At MSPCA (Massachusetts Society for the Preven-tion of Cruelty to Animals) Nevins Farm, the num-ber of private horse surrenders surged from 21 in2007 to more than 70 in 2009.\" Brian Benson, Boston Globe, January 14, 2010. \"Neglected Horses in Maryland Multiply as Economy Continues to Sag\" \"Horse rescue operators are wrestling with a stag-gering number of horses in need of homes, a byprod-uct of the region's crumbling economy, strugglingracetracks and the closure of U.S. slaughterplants.\" Megan Miller, Capital News Service, March 13, 2009\" It is common knowledge that the number of horses with low body condition scores (BCS /H110213/9) due to simple (absence of primary disease) starvation havedramatically increased in humane shelters since2007, yet there is very little information clearly out-lining the nutritional rehabilitation plan for thespectrum of such cases. In the worst-case scenario,an adult horse will lose approximately 40% of opti-mal body weight (BW) due to a complete lack of feedfor 60-90 days, and will no longer be able to supportitself, become sternal initially, and then laterallyrecumbent, and then most will die within 72-96 hours if they cannot rise. 1,2Once 40-45% of opti - mum BW has been lost, survival is unlikely regard-less of aggressive treatment. Fortunately, mostlow-BCS equine cases do receive some fraction of aninadequate diet, often of poor quality, for more than3-4 months and are presented to humane sheltersor rescue leagues before becoming recumbent. 3 The objective here is to suggest a nutritional reha-bilitation plan for low BCS (1-3/9) horses due tosimple starvation-based on initial BCS and labora-tory data uncomplicated by primary disease. 2. Materials and Methods Physical Examination An immediate and thorough examination of each animal will help to pinpoint the cause of the weightloss and identify any concurrent diseases or preex-isting condition. BW should be accurately recordedusing a weigh scale as opposed to weight tapes mea-surements, which, even if performed correctly can beoff by /H110065% (50 lb in 1000 lb horse). Most starved equine cases occur through the winter months whenhair coats are long, dull, and unkempt that tend tomask loss of body fat and muscle; hence, proper BCSdeterminations and assessment of muscle wastingmust be completed using physical palpation. It is AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 537HOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSE NOTESimportant to remember that BCS is directly relatedto the body fat content and does not include anassessment of muscle mass. It is presently as-sumed that horses, similar to other species, at opti-mal BCS approximately 15-20% body fat(subcutaneous [SC], intramuscular [IM], abdomi-nal). 4However body fat as percentage of weight may not be linear at low BCS; ie, as BCS decreases, percentage of body fat loses are exponential.5In the face of decreasing fat stores with continued ca-loric deciency, more muscle (skeletal and visceral)is catabolized for energy. Given that the half-life ofserum albumin in the horse is approximately 19days, a low serum albumin in the absence of proteinlosing enteropathy, renal or liver disease would sug-gest inadequate feed intake for many weeks. 3 Measurement of BW and condition do not provide sufcient evidence of emaciation. Muscle wastingin the absence of fat is a relatively better assessmentof malnutrition and extent of suboptimal nutrientintake. 6,7Extent of muscle loss is the primary de - terminant of survival because without treatment, asseen in several species, a greater than 25-30% lossof body protein compromises cardiac and pulmonarymuscle strength. 8Cause of death is usually due to cardiac/respiratory arrest as a result of cardiac/ respiratory muscle degradation and electrolyte im-balances. Muscle scoring has been recently intro-duced into the physical examination of dogs andcats, which is assessed by visualization and palpa-tion of the spine, scapulae, skull, and wings of theilia. Muscle loss is typically rst noted in the ep-axial muscles on each side of the spine. Muscle lossat other sites can be more variable, and is graded asnormal, mild, moderate loss, or severe loss. 9A standardized muscle scoring system does not yet exist for horses to my knowledge. However, theBCS and some assessment of muscle wasting com-bined can be important information when triaginglimited resources because approximately 20% of se-verely malnourished (BCS 1) horses will die regard-less of attempts to treat due to extensive musclewasting. 1,10 Blood Biochemical Evaluations Knowledge of the laboratory ndings in emaciatedhorses is useful in scoring the intensity of emacia-tion, and in establishing a prognosis. 11Blood work results (i.e., increased free fatty lower Mg, Ca, K, and insulin) may aidin the determination of the extent and severity ofstarvation, and in conjunction with BCS, may helpwith the decision to treat given nancial, logistic,and time constraints. 10,12,13 If the decision is to initiate treatment, based on initial blood work, the patient should be rehydratedorally if possible; however, IV correction of electro-lyte and acid base imbalances (without glucose) maybe necessary and should be started before the rein-troduction of feed. A 10-50 mL/500 kg BW in conjunction with IV fluid therapy for 1-3days to begin repletion of those vitamins essential toenergy metabolism. Feeding Plan Once the physical examination and laboratory datahave been collected and the commitment to rehabil-itate and refeed the patient has been made, a feed-ing plan based on BCS (Table 1). One must resistthe human urge to provide these horses with largeamounts of hay and grain. In my experience, it wasvery important to explain specically to owners, vet-erinary technicians, barn help, and whomever mayhave access to the patient, the importance of a slowand methodical reintroduction to feed that must ex-clude them from feeding the patient any feeds otherthan the type and amount prescribed. The well-intentioned attendant feeding outside of the pre-scribed plan may initiate a refeeding syndrome andpossible death of the animal. The refeeding syn-drome has been well described previously, and sowill not be described here other than to say it mustbe avoided. 12,14 Refeed the Gut First It should be cause for pause when considering therst feed into a compromised small intestine (SI).The SI itself is universally dependent on intralumi-nal nutrition, and within days of no food, will showevidence of compromise. 15As seen in other species, by day 7 without food, small-bowel weight will have decreased by 22%, mucosal weight (/H1100228%), protein (/H1100235%), and DNA (/H1100225%) will be signicantly less than day 1; all of which compromises SI function.16 SI atrophy is characterized by decreased villusheight and crypt depth, surface area and motility, brush border enzymes, secretions, and immunitywith an increased risk of bacteria (including pro-biotics), endotoxin, and cytokine translocation.Overall, the net effect of not feeding the SI isdecreased end-stage digestive enzymes, nutrient-absorptive processes with an increased risk of sys-temic infection. Microbiome Large intestine in a mature horse is composed of thececum (25-30 L), large colon (50-60 L), small colon(18-20 L) and when emptied, constitutes 4-5% ofBW in a mature horse. Large intestine is the pri-mary site of the equid microbiome digesting most ofthe dietary ber and approximately half of the sol-uble carbohydrate, then absorbs the resulting nutri-ents as released. There is also microbial proteinproduced, digested, and absorbed from the cecumand colon. Hence, when refeeding a malnourishedhorse, one must consider careful refeeding of themicrobiome initially. You have two patients (hostand microbiome) one cannot survive/thrive 538 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSEwithout the other. The microbiome is a very largenumber and diverse group of microbes, outnumber-ing the horse itself in term of total cell number andDNA. Our understanding of the composition andfunction of this population have been extremely lim-ited but we do know the microbiome is profoundlyaltered in certain disease states to the detriment ofits host. We are only now developing the computa-tional abilities to collect and analyze the data bywhich to identify species and numbers within thenormal microbiome of a horse. The developmentand increasing availability of next generation se-quencing and evolving bioinformatics offer never-before-available tools by which to study the equinemicrobiome. 17Probiotics are widely used presently because they are thought to do no harm but we should have a specic end goal in mind when weprescribe a treatment. As such, I believe the use ofprobiotics at this time to reestablish the microbiomein malnourished horses a waste of dollars betterspent otherwise, at least until we know what we aretrying to achieve and there are known efcaciousproducts available. 18 By way of an example on how to reestablish the equine microbiome, foals born with a sterile gutobtain a mature microbiome similar to their mareswithin in the rst few weeks of life. 19The source of microbes is thought to begin during passage through the mare's vagina, but then maternal contact (nurs-ing, grooming) and exploring behaviors provide con-tact with bedding, dirt, and feces, etc. 20Foals preferentially consume fresh over dried feces from their dams.21They have also been known to con - sume pasture, hay, or grain as early as a day old andby week 5 may spend more than 20% of their timegrazing or eating nonmilk foods. Therefore, I amsuggesting that in the rehabilitation of starvedhorses, that they be \"housed\" surrounded by otherhorses, feeds, dirt, and manure which should bemore conducive to replenishing their microbiome asit proceeded once before in their lives as foals, ratherthan isolated in a frequently picked stall. Feeding Plan At this time, it would seem prudent to begin withrations containing less than 20% readily availablecarbohydrate estimated by nonstructural carbohy-drate (NSC) band higher ber (15-25%), preferably a mix of soluble and insoluble, respectively, to avoid causing the refeeding syndrome and refeed the mi-crobiome. There are in rations; however, NSC isa technically accurate term and should be used tocompare feeds. Currently the best ber estimatewe have is crude ber.Forage Rations There are only a few studies on the refeeding of starved horses, but feeding high-forage ration rst isa common recommendation. The lower the BCSand the greater the muscle loss in patients, thehigher the protein level should be in the initial for-age fed because it takes protein synthesis to regen-erate a full complement of digestive enzymes andserum carrier molecules to transport nutrients fromthe intestines and liver to other tissues. In gen-eral, legume hays contain 18-23% protein cwith 11% NCS whereas grass hays (timothy, orchard, and fescue) contain 6-14% protein with 13% NCS. Aforage-rst plan also the whichis in essential to regenerating gastrointestinaltrack physically (mucosa) and functionally (motility)and provides nutrients (energy, protein and vita-mins) to the host. Grain and Concentrates Grains should be used sparingly during the initialfeeding plan as the more debilitated the patient,higher is the risk for the deadly refeeding syndrome,which will often occur within the rst 10-14 daysdue to a sudden increased carbohydrate intake.NSC is highest in grains such as corn (73%), oats(48%), and wheat (66%), In addition, these grainsare relatively low in protein (8-13%) and crude ber(2-9%) and as such are not the best feeds fed ini-tially to starved horses. The term concentrate generally implies a grain mixed with minerals and vitamins in a pelleted or\"sweet\" feed form to keep the micronutrients wellmixed throughout the feed. Although feeding min-erals and vitamins initially to starved horses willhelp in reviving co-factors and co-enzymes of metab-olism, feeding these micronutrients with a grain isnot advisable initially, again to avoid a refeedingsyndrome. Complete \"senior\" feeds have been sug-gested with caution because they may contain morethan 20% NSC. Another option might be thosecomplete feeds marketed as \"low carb\" that prod- uctsffor refeeding horses are the market. These contain high-protein quality ingre- dients such as alfalfa, soy, and whey, a mix of bertypes (14%) with minerals and some B- and fat-soluble vitamins was designed and tested clinicallyin hypophagic horses. A powdered product freport - edly containing 11% starch /H11001sugar can be offered for voluntary consumption or tube fed after addingwater. 22 Appetite Stimulation Assuming there are no contraindications to signi-cant oral feeding such as dental, pharyngeal, oresophageal lesions, feed offered for oral consumptionis preferable to tube feeding or parenteral nutrition.In cases with oral lesions that inhibit or decrease AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 539HOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSEoral food consumption, in addition to treating thelesions and analgesics, offering soft green grass or amash (a complete low-NSC-extruded pellet soakedin water) may decrease the pain of eating suf-ciently to improve intakes. Grass pastures on av-erage have 7-23% protein and 6-20% NSC andmostly mixed-grass (MMG) pastures have 11-25%protein and 7-18% NSC and so are appropriate forstarved horses as an appetite stimulant. Fever orpain elsewhere may also decrease appetite and insuch cases administering antipyretics and analge-sics may improve feed intake. 23,24 Feeding at least 10-25% of daily requirement us- ing the gastrointestinal tract has been shown (in G.pigs) to signicantly decrease SI atrophy, which inturn should promote appetite. 25Offering small amounts (0.1-0.3% BW), removing discarded feedafter a few hours, and frequently replacing with avariety of fresh forages is stimulating and palatableto most horses as well as being in the presence ofother horses eating. Bran mashes, although popu-lar, alone are not that palatable to horses, and somixing with oats, barley, or a sweet feed with 1 cupof molasses and 1-3 tsp of salt may improve con-sumption. Although some horses will eat lying down, most prefer to be standing and so use of a sling or otherupright supportive measures may improve feed con-sumption. If able to walk, grazing in hand evendried pasture grasses several times a day may im-prove the horses' feed intake and attitude, giventhat some patients prefer to eat from the groundrather than from a hanging bucket, bin or rack. 3 Diazepam administered at low dosages IV may induce a horse to consume feed immediately aftertreatment but only for 15-20 minutes and only ifthere are no distractions, etc.; hence, it is not advis-able. In addition, debilitated horses may becometranquilized and ataxic unless lower dosages areused. Repeated dosing does not produce consistentresults and should be avoided in patients with he-patic compromise. Anabolic steroids and cortico-steroids do not have an immediate effect but mayincrease feed intake after several days. 26 Psychological Needs In tempting a partially anorexic or hypophagic horseto eat, satisfying their psychological needs are es-sential. Horses are a prey species and thereforesafety (from harm) and comfort (lack of pain andsocial separation/pressures) take higher priorityover food consumption, and only after the patientfeels safe and comfortable, will they consider eating.Oftentimes hospitalizing a patient, although mostconvenient for the veterinary staff, is sufcientlyfrightening to inhibit food consumption. Unfamil-iar sights, sounds, smells, aggressive (as seen fromthe horse's view) human behaviors, unaccustomed tobeing boxed indoors (limited sight line), all are notconducive to stimulating appetite. In most cases,keeping herd mates together or close but separatedto avoid feed competition and allow for measure- ment of individual feed intake in relatively openspaces is the best situation conducive to appetiteimprovement. Tube Feedings Completely anorectic or severely hypophagic horsesmay need to be tube fed to meet all or some of itsnutritional needs. There are a limited number offeed options: complete feed slurries, homemaderecipes, liquid products designed horses. Eachoption has disadvantages. 22,27,28There are poten - tially advantages to include glutamine and solubleber into liquid tube feeding product. Glutamine, aconditionally essential amino acid is needed duringperiods of physiologic stress to stimulate SI DNAsynthesis and will increase SI mucosal mass early inrecovery. 24Fiber modulates intestinal mo to re-establish normal peristaltic action andtransit time, and nondigestible bulk to buffer toxinsand holds water to minimize diarrhea. It would beadvised, therefore, that tube-fed rations containboth of these nutrients. There are some disadvantages to tube feeding in that horses may become resistant to nasogastric in-tubation after 4-5 days with mild epistaxis. 21Met- abolic disadvantages to tube feeding vs voluntaryconsumption of the same low-NSC diets have beenreported. Adult horses with good BCS consuming alow-NSC feed voluntarily had lower insulin concen-trations (P /H11021.05) at 120 and 140 minutes and lower blood glucose levels at 30 minutes postfeeding thansimilar horses receiving the same dose of feed vianasogastric tube. 21,29 Parenteral Nutrition Although it is possible to meet the daily caloric andamino acid requirements of an adult horse, the tech-nical and nancial obstacles are much greater thanrehabilitating a patient using oral voluntary con-sumption or tube feeding and hence rarely imple-mented in horses under the care of humane sheltersor rescue leagues. 30,31 Amount and Frequency of a Refeeding Plan Beginning digestible energy (DE) intake is based oncurrent (not optimal) BW of the patient using theNational Research Council (NRC) 2007 minimummaintenance (low voluntary activity) equation:DE Mcal/day /H11005BW kg/H110030.03.32It is recommended that several transition days be used initially to bring the patient up to this initial minimum DE goal, i.e.,3-4 days for a BCS 3 horse vs 6-10 days for a BCS1 horse using a low NSC feed (Table 1). In addi-tion, the daily amount of feed should be initiallydivided into multiple feedings per day, again de-pending on BCS, i.e., 3 meals/day for a BCS 3 horsevs 6 meals/day for a BCS 1 horse. The amount offeed consumed (feed in /H11002feed out) should be re- 540 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO FEED THE SPECIAL NEEDS HORSEcorded and consumption as a percentage BW shouldbe calculated (total kg of feed consumed per day/BWkg) and reviewed frequently in the early phases ofrehabilitation. Ration DE, protein, NSC, fat, andcrude ber concentrations are suggested by BCS(Table 1). Example: A 14-year-old mare with BW 314 kg, BCS 2 with moderate muscle wasting.Step 1An initial daily minimum DE goal would be 9.4Mcal/day (314 /H110030.03), using a 4-6-day transition period to reach that minimum and with each days'feed total divided into 4 meals/day using a MMG hay(with 2.1 Mcal/kg, 12% protein and 12% NSC) (perTable 1; BCS column 2), the initial feeding planwould be as follows (Table 2). Step 2 If the mare consumed 4.5 kg of hay on day 4 (1.4% BW) and if there were no complications, the dailyDE intake should be increased (1.2 /H11003) to 11.3 Mcal/ day fed in 4 or 3 meals/day depending on her clinicalresponse. So the daily feeding orders at this pointwould be 5.3 kg MMG hay/day (1.7% BW) divided into 3 meals of 1.8 kg/each. Monitoring Body weight should be measured weekly using aweigh scale rather than a weight tape. It should beexpected that weights may initially decrease or notchange during the initial feed transition days to fullDE intakes or may increase due to rehydration andincreased gut ll. 33,34Hence, it will be several weeks before a pattern of weight gain can be dis- cerned and considered reliable.

Recovering low-BCS horses, if overfed, may have secondary medical conditions such as refeedingsyndrome, acute laminitis, diarrhea, and/or colic.Most will have some soft feces initially with refeed-ing but this should be temporary and in no waydehydrating or debilitating to the patient. Appe-tite should improve and a subjective improvement inthe patient should be noticeable within the rst 5days of refeeding. Monitor and treat pressure soresin recumbent horses to not only minimize pain anddiscomfort and improve appetite but minimize heatlost through open sores or skin abrasions. Recum-bent horses should have deep comfortable beddingavailable but regularly be encouraged to stand, walkabout, graze, and if they should resume recumbency,be it on a different side. 3. Results There are a limited number of studies available bywhich to estimate progress in these equine cases.Broad estimates of average daily weight gain andweeks to achieve an ideal BCS of 4 or 5/9 are esti-mated in Table 1. 2,3,10,12,32 4. Summary The objective here was to propose a nutritional re-habilitation plan for low-BCS horses 1-3due to sim - ple (uncomplicated) starvation based on initial BCSand laboratory data to help rescue organizationsand shelters assess the resources needed to rehabil-itate such a patient. As in medicine, each case isunique. Veterinarians employed by or assistingequine shelters should not hesitate to consult with aveterinary nutritionist, given various case complex-ities and limited feed options available to some shel-ter groups may not t well into this proposedrefeeding outline.

Introduction Most of us have the ability to view readily available,unedited nancial statements (balance sheet, in-come statement and cash flow) for our practice butmany of us do not take the time to look at the wealthof information they yield. If we do not have ameans to readily generate these reports we are allpresented nal, edited versions of our nancialstatements at least once if not four times annuallyfrom our accountants. Simply looking at the netincome at the bottom of the Prot and Loss State-ment is grossly misleading. Financial statementscontain extremely valuable information that canhelp practitioners identify internal strengths andweaknesses. By using past data, we have the abil-ity to make economic predictions as they pertain toour businesses. It is the objective of this abstract todene for its readers what each of the nancialstatements reflects, what conclusions can and can-not be made from them, and how to identify keyelements of each statement.2. Solution Although valuable information can be extractedfrom each statement, they provide considerablymore information when looked at together. Eachstatement has its own strengths and weaknesses.The study of all three of the statements provides thepractice owner, manager, or associate the tools nec-essary to properly evaluate the health of the busi-ness with very few exceptions. One of the most commonly used monitoring tools is called trend analysis, otherwise known as hor-izontal analysis. This method compares the ac-tual dollar amount as well as the percent changeover time allowing one to select specic line itemswithin any of the nancial statements for compar-ison. Simple equations are used to make thesecomparisons. Dollar Amount of Change /H11005Current Amount /H11002 Base Year Amount Percent Change /H11005(Current Year Amount /H11002Base Year Amount)/Base Year Amount 544 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICE NOTESExamples of each nancial statement are included in this report for your reference. The statementsare examples of a small business providing veteri-nary services and having investments in real estate. The rst of the nancial statements is the Balance Sheet (Example A in the Appendix). The balancesheet is often considered a snapshot image of thebusiness's assets, liabilities, and stockholders' eq-uity at one particular point in time. It is considereda measure of the nancial position of the company.Assets are divided up into current and long term.Short-term assets are those that can be converted tocash in less than a year through the ongoing prac-tices of the business. For example, inventory(pharmaceuticals), and cash accounts. Long-termassets include everything else, such as equipment,buildings, land, and vehicles. There is also a seg-ment under assets that reflects depreciation. De-preciation is an entry into the books that lowers thevalue of the asset over time due to the predicted lifeexpectancy of the asset. The second component ofthe balance sheet is the businesses liabilities. Likeassets, liabilities are divided into current and longterm. Current liabilities must be paid within oneyear. For example, accounts payable and principalpayments on loans. Alternatively, long-term liabil-ities include all other liabilities of the company.An example of a long-term liability would be princi-pal payments on a real estate mortgage. Finally,the third component of the balance sheet, calledstockholder's equity is the difference between thecompany's total assets and total liabilities. Simplystated, it represents the net worth of the company. The next nancial statement is the prot and loss, also known as the income statement (Example B inthe Appendix). Unlike the balance sheet, the in-come statement reveals the nancial condition of thebusiness over a period of time. It reflects the in-come (sales) and expenses (costs). All revenuesgenerated by the sales activity of the business arerecorded less the cost of the goods sold and theexpenses incurred to attain sales of product or ser-vice. The difference between sales and costs areconsidered the business' net income. Prots aregenerated when the sales exceed costs. The com-pany incurs nancial losses when and if the costsexceed sales. The cost of goods sold (COGS) is thecosts of all the raw materials needed to provide aservice or produce a good. In most of our cases,COGS reflects the total of inventory items such aspenicillin, gentocin, and ketamine. SubtractingCOGS from total revenues (sales) equals the compa-ny's gross prot. It is important to recognize thatour inventory of medicines is not an expense. Op-erating expenses consist of items such employee ex-penses, management fees, and utilities. Subtractingexpenses from gross prots yields net income. Theincome statement provides a good indication of thecompany's xed costs (the cost of operating the busi-ness that are not dependent on sales volume) as wellas the variable costs (costs of operating the businessthat vary with sales volume). Depreciation ex- pense is calculated specically to record the depre-ciation of assets. If your business owns assets suchas a truck, endoscope, or radiographic machine thereis a depreciation expense. This expense is calcu-lated by using the asset cost minus the salvage valueover the life expectancy of the asset. Although de-preciation is the expensing of tangible assets, amor-tization is the expensing of intangible assets. The cash flow statement takes information from the balance sheet and income statement to summa-rize changes in cash flows due to business activityover a period of time (Example C in the Appendix).It represents the cash position of the business andreflects the ability of that business to pay its debts.Cash flow projections are made using the expectedcash receipts to schedule payments to suppliers. 3. Discussion There are pros and cons of each of the nancialstatements. Although there are a number of con-clusions that can be drawn from the information it isalso important to recognize a few of the limitationsof each statement. For example, the accounts re-ceivable (A/R) balance is itemized in the balancesheet under assets. Without looking into this fur-ther, one may conclude that the A/R balance repre-sents expected future income when it may actuallyreflect age accounts in excess of 120 days that arelikely uncollectable. In Example A, under currentassets, the company has an unusually high A/R bal-ance of $73,815.22. It would be important to see anaging summary of this line item to determinewhether the debts owed the company are collectable.It will also be important to follow the horizontaltrend analysis of this line item over time. Is thisamount an aberration in the normal activities of thecompany? Calculating the percent change fromlast year would provide valuable information to thepractice's ability to collect on accounts. A commonmistake made when looking at the income state-ment (Example B) is putting too much emphasis onthe net income. Net income is the bottom line onthe statement and is an indication of the protsearned by the company operations. What many donot realize is that it does not reflect distributionsmade to owners as compensation if the entity is alimited liability company (LLC), nor does it reflectpayments made to the principal of outstandingloans. Therefore, one must look at the net incomefrom the income statement then look for distribu-tions and payments on liabilities found in the bal-ance sheet to recognize the gain or loss of cash.Businesses for which too many draws are beingmade from or that have an overwhelming debt loadmight be unsustainable despite high prots. Usingthe provided examples, Example B indicates a netincome of $193,703.10. One must then look back atthe balance sheet (Example A) under equity to de-termine what the dollar value of distributions madeto owners is. The example only provides a total of AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 545THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICE$517,405.70 but the breakdown of the line item re-veals that the fraction representing owner distribu-tions is $219,682.26. Therefore, although at rstglance a business generating $382,137.92 netting$193,703.10 in net income sounds good, the owner istaking too much cash out of the business to be sus-tainable. Horizontal trend analysis used herewould reveal if this was an ongoing trend or if thedistributions are unusually high for this period.The excessive distributions have contributed to theloss of $49,724.96 in available cash flows at the endof the period as seen in Example C. In addition, thenancial statements allow us to determine the rate of annual growth of accounts receivable and inven-tory. If these growth rates exceed that of the rev-enue growth rate, cash is being depleted and isconsidered unsustainable. Frequent analysis ofone's nancial statements is one of the most valu-able tools available to practice owners to assess thestrengths and weaknesses of their business. State-ment analysis is not a complicated process but themore one looks at them, the more one will learn andthe more comfortable one will be in the informationone gleans from them. 546 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEAppendix Example A Balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

Introduction A clear message inferred from reports on the 2015American Veterinary Medical Association Report onthe Market for Veterinary Education is that the costof veterinary education is creating a signicant -nancial burden for recent graduates. Although the2015 national average 4-year cost for education was$103,327 for in-state seats and $192,710 for out-of-state seats, the graduates who lled those seats leftschool with a mean debt of $132,560 and $187,379,respectively. 1Compounding the nancial predica- ment created by the excessive debt accumulated,these new veterinary graduates entered the work-force in 2015 facing an average debt-to-income ratioof 1.9:1. 2 Meanwhile, practicing equine veterinarians con- tinue to face the problems created by the economicrecession that started in 2008. Not only do reve-nues continue to be affected through the competitionfor service provision within the shrinking pool thatis the clients' dwindling discretionary spending, butthe bottom line continues to be adversely affected bythe ever-increasing costs of doing business. Mak-ing the move to hire a new associate\u2014whether be-cause there is opportunity to grow the practice orbecause there is a desire by the owner to slowdown\u2014is a situation dened by the nancial quan- dary created by the new workforce that will demandmore money than they are initially worth to makeends meet, and the reduced money available withinthe industry. Veterinary business owners need thetools to properly forecast the actual expenses asso-ciated with employing a new associate for their spe-cic practice. Only then would they be able todetermine the compensation amount that can beoffered that would still provide a sound nancialdecision for the practice through the delivery of thereturns required by the investment. The analysiswould provide the potential associate with the nan-cial facts that dictate their worth to that specicpractice so that they, in turn, could make their ownnancial decision regarding the practice's ability tomeet their self-created nancial needs. 2. Case Example of the Cash Flows Related to Hiring a New Associate A case example of a new associate hiring project is presented in Table 1. The data presented are basedon the high end of the results obtained from theauthor's recent, nonscientic survey of members ofthe American Association of Equine Practice Busi-ness Rounds Discussion Group 3together with as- sumptions that mimic actual data from a private AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 551THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICE NOTESpractice regarding total revenues, gross margins,and costs for overhead. The components of the ta-ble are detailed and explained throughout the rest ofthe document. 3. New Associate's Revenue and Revenue Source The revenue generated by a new associate will besourced from either the generation of new serviceprovision or from the transfer of existing serviceprovision to the new hire. Although the source ofthe revenue will not affect the nancial analysis forthe decision of hiring and establishing the salaryand benet compensation for the new associate, itwill affect the overall practice's cash flow and bottomline. If all of the new hire's revenue productionwere to be a transfer of already-existing service pro-vision, the practice's total revenue generation wouldlag the newly increased operational expenses asso-ciated with the new hire and the practice's overallnances would be negatively affected. Survey-re-sponding members expected a new associate's rst-year revenue production, on average, to be between$127,000 and $170,000, with 74% of this productioncoming from transferring of service provision thatthe practice was already doing, and that this reve-nue would be grown between 15 and 20% by Year 2(Table 2). This implies that the practice memberswould be giving up between $93,980 and $125,800(revenue range /H1100374%) of their own revenue gener- ation for Year 1, but that the new associate wouldgrow that revenue by 15-20% in Year 2. In aproper analysis of the total practice's expected cashflows, this revenue growth would have to be evalu-ated against the growth the revenue would haveachieved had it been growing at the practice's cur-rent growth rate. Our case example shows an ini-tial gross revenue of $169,355 with a dened revenue growth for the following years. Although the new associate's net cash flow pro- duction would be based on the expected revenuegeneration and the operational expenses that areattributable to the new position, which are discussedbelow, the practice's cash flow would be affected, notonly by the changes in operational expenses attrib-utable to existing members of the practice plus thenet cash flow produced by the new associate, but alsoby the reduction in the practice's revenue secondaryto the service provision transfer. In all instanceswhere service transfer negatively affects the prac-tice's overall nances, the acceptance of reducedcash flows and prots must be analyzed by the busi-ness owner through the eyes of hopeful improve-ment in personal and mental health generated bythe decreased workload and the increased level ofwork-life balance. 4.

The obvious ones include actualcash outflows for the benet of the new hire throughthe purchase and setup costs of the equipment ac-quired for the associate's exclusive use. The not-so-obvious ones include the estimation of the value ofthe already-owned equipment that is transferred tothe associate when the owner takes advantage of theopportunity to purchase a new one for his/her ownuse. Although the cash outflow would not be di-rectly made on behalf of the associate, the estima-tion of the worth of the equipment handed to thehire is necessary to determine the investment doneinto the new position; a gure that will be requiredwhen performing future nancial analysis calcula-tions such as net present value (NVP) and internalrate of return (IRR). Respondents to the surveyconveyed that they expected the equipment pur-chase and setup costs for a new associate to be, onaverage, between $26,000 and $51,000 (Table 2).During the process of initial analysis, one must notforget to include within the setup costs those one-time hiring-related expenses such as paid relocationexpenses. Our case example shows a $50,313 cashoutflow for new equipment to set up the associate. 5. Forecasted Associate Expenses Salary Compensation Depending on the individual practice owner's expe-rience, the type of salary compensation style utilizedfor a new associate has usually been a combinationof what they think would work for the practice andwhat they think is fair based on the income theyexpect the associate to produce. Neither of these,however, has ever been completely based on factualnumbers related to the practice's current situationor the complete expenses attributable to the posi-tion. The goal of this paper is to provide the toolsthat will help veterinary business owners to moreprecisely calculate the new employee's expenses asrelated to the expected revenue, so that they canmore precisely adopt the type of salary compensa-tion style and compensation amount that will bettert the practice based on its nancials and intendedoperations. It is the potential employee's responsi-bility to then see if what they are worth to thespecic practice will allow them to meet their own nancial needs. An interesting nding from the survey is the wide distribution of compensation styles utilized by thesurvey's respondents (Table 3). Although a specicdifferentiation was not made by the respondentsbetween base salary and base salary plus addedproduction percent, the respondents conveyed that,on average, they expected the new associate's rst-year compensation to be between $48,000 and$58,000 (Table 2). Our case example utilized a$57,422 base salary or 28% of total gross, whicheverwas higher. Business Benets It is normally expected for veterinary business own-ers to cover the expenses necessary to allow theassociate to provide veterinary services for the prac-tice. Veterinary license, DEA license, continuingeducation, and mobile phone are some of the mostcommon ones. In addition, other expenses such astravel to meetings (/H11006meals), membership dues, and malpractice insurance are also usually covered.Respondents to the survey indicated that they ex-pected, on average, that these benets would costthe practice between $3,500 and $6,000 in Year 1(Table 4). Our case example assumed a 0.5%yearly growth of business benets.Table 3.

On average, the surveyrespondents indicated that they expected the rst-year associate's insurance expense to be approxi-mately $4,500, with the employer covering approximately 86% of the total cost (Table 4). Ourcase example assumed a 0.5% yearly growth ofhealth insurance benets. Business consults performed by the author have shown that some employers provide associates withthe additional benet of compensation for disabilityinsurance. Although the total expense of this ben-et is the same for the employer regardless of towhom the check is written (insurance company oremployee), to whom the check is written makes adifference to the employee. If the premium is paidby the employer directly to the insurance company,any disability benets received by the employeewould be considered taxable income. In contrast, ifthe cost of the premium was paid to the employee asa business benet, and the employee paid the pre-mium, the money from the employer would be tax-able income to the employee but the disabilitybenets from the insurance company would not betaxable income. 4To this end, a disability situation would most likely suggest that the employee would be better served through the receipt of nontaxabledisability benets and therefore the employershould provide this business benet in the way thatis most advantageous to the employee. Vehicle Expense In an equine practice with an ambulatory compo-nent to it, there are two types of situations related tothe expected vehicle expense that must be analyzedby each individual practice. The practice can pro-vide a business-owned vehicle to the associate forhim/her to practice out of, or it could require theassociate to provide their own vehicle and then re-imburse him/her for the business miles driven at arate dictated by the Internal Revenue Service.The use of a business-owned vehicle by the associateplaces the expense of vehicle ownership, insurance,repairs, maintenance, etc. on the employer and cre-ates no nancial situation for the employee. The use of a personal vehicle by the associate transfers all of the vehicle expenses to the employee,which would be partially offset by the mileage reim-bursement paid by the employer. The mileage re-imbursement rate for 2016 is $0.54 per businessmile. 5An employer can choose to pay the stated rate, a lower rate if they deem the vehicle is not driven 100% for business purposes, or a higher rateif they want to be generous. Although the mileagereimbursement amount is an expense to the em-ployer, any properly documented mileage reim-bursement at or below the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rate is nontaxable income to the employee(anything paid above the IRS rate would be consid-ered taxable income). There are advantages and disadvantages to each method and the specics must be analyzed withinthe context of each individual practice. Survey re-spondents who would select to reimburse the newassociate for the use of their personal vehicle indi-cated that they, on average, would pay $0.52 foreach of the 23,392 miles they would expect the newassociate to drive in the rst year (Table 4). Thiswas the method utilized for the case example. Retirement Plan Contribution Dened contribution plans are offered by some em-ployers and the contribution, matching, and cover-age requirements are dependent on the type ofretirement plan used by the business owner. 6Those employers who provide a matching benet into an employee's retirement account usually match a per-cent of the employee's contribution up to a maxi-mum and may have a waiting period before thematching commences. Survey respondents indi-cated that, on average, they matched 86% of eachemployee's contribution, with the total matchingcapped at a maximum of 3% of the employee's totalsalary compensation, and started matching on Year2 of employment (Table 4). The case example useda 6% employee contribution with a 3% employermatching cap starting in Year 2. FICA and FUTA Taxes Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act(FICA), an employer's federal payroll tax responsi-bilities include withholding from an employee's com-pensation and paying the employer's portion of thecontribution for Social Security and Medicare taxes.FICA requires that an employer withhold 6.2% ofthe employee's compensation for Social Security andmust similarly pay a matching 6.2% for the employ-er's portion (12.4% total). For 2016, this tax is lev-ied on the employee's compensation level up to an$118,500 wage base limit. FICA also requires thatan employer withhold 1.45% of all of the employee'scompensation for Medicare taxes and must similarlypay a matching 1.45% for the employer's portion(2.9% total; there is no wage base limit). Althoughan employer is also required to withhold a 0.9%Additional Medicare Tax on an employee's wagespaid in excess of $200,000, there is no matching fromthe employer and therefore no employer expenseassociated with this surtax. 7 Under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), employers are subject to federal unemploy-ment taxes based on various factors. 8The FUTA tax is a single 6% rate on the rst $7,000 of wages paid to each employee for which the tax applies.However, if the employer pays their state unemploy-ment taxes by their due date, a claim can be madefor 5.4% of the federally taxable wages, effectively 554 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEreducing FUTA to a 0.6% tax. The rate for stateunemployment taxes are state dependent and somestates require withholding for unemployment taxeson employees. General tax rates by state informa-tion is readily available, 9but to properly calculate federal and state unemployment taxes for one's spe- cic situation, a CPA and/or tax advisor should beconsulted. Our case example utilized Kentucky'sstate rate of 2.7% applied to the rst $10,200 ofwages. Workers' Compensation Workers' compensation is a disability compensationprogram that serves to mitigate the nancial burdenresulting from workplace injury. The rate paid bythe employer is dependent on the state where thepractice is located and on each practice's individualsituation given that the rate paid can change basedon the business' workplace injury history. Our caseexample used a 0.4% rate. Overhead Aside from cash flows for interest and debt, a prac-tice's cash outflows can be divided into four easy-to-understand classes: there is a cash outflow for thesalary compensation of those who produce revenuesfor the practice, there is a cash outflow for the ben-ets paid out and the expenses incurred on behalf ofthose who produce revenues for the practice, there isa cash outflow for the inventory and outside servicesutilized during the production of revenues, andthere is a cash outflow for the overhead expensesthat cover all of the systems and personnel the prac-tice puts in place to aid in the production of revenue. The new associate's expenses for the rst two classes can be easily dened and calculated beingthat they are straightforward. The associate'sshare of the overhead expense, though, is one that isoften missed or not properly calculated when ana-lyzing the net cash flow expected from the associ-ate's service provision. The author has found thatan activity-based costing (ABC) system is the truest,most honest, and most accurate way to distributethe share of overhead among the revenue-producingentities in the practice. An ABC system improvesthe ability to estimate the cash flows associated witha specic project by separating costs into activitycost pools and identifying a cost driver for eachpool. 10In essence, the practice's overhead costs can be assigned to the practice's different revenue- producing activities in accordance with the portionof the overhead costs consumed by each activity.A cost driver can be identied for each of the denedactivity cost pools and the overhead costs can thenbe allocated to each of the revenue-producing ser-vices in proportion to the amount of the cost driverconsumed by each service (See Appendix 1 for a caseexample). A generic method of applying ABC to an equine practice's overhead is to identify total overhead asthe activity cost pool and each dollar of revenue asthe cost driver. In this manner, each dollar of rev- enue will carry a portion of the overhead expense asdictated by the percentage of total overhead expenseagainst total revenues. If, for example, a givenyear's total overhead was 25% of revenue, then eachdollar of revenue would carry $0.25 of overhead ex-pense. The actual calculation of overhead expenseagainst each dollar of revenue will be more precisethe more detailed the overhead expenses get as-signed to the different sources of revenues. Busi-ness insurance, for example, would be an overheadcost that would be equally assigned among allsources of revenue given that they all would con-sume this cost at the same rate, but overhead costsassociated with the veterinary technician should beassigned based on the consumption of that cost bythe different sources of revenue (revenue from ra-diographic procedures, where the assistant is uti-lized, would consume a high cost whereas revenuefrom external laboratory work would consume a lowcost). The end result of this process is a more pre-cise estimation of the portion of the practice's totaloverhead expense that should be attributed to thenew associate's production. Our case example utilized a practice's total over- head of $55,133 that grew by 1% yearly. The asso-ciate's portion for each year was calculated as thetotal overhead times the associate's revenue as apercent of the practice's total revenue. Cost of Goods Sold In veterinary medicine, the cash outflow for the in-ventory and outside services utilized during the pro-duction of revenues corresponds to the practice'scost of goods sold (COGS). Analysis of the prac-tice's nancials should precisely indicate the busi-ness' gross margin during the past several years,which would suggest the practice's running COGS.Just like with overhead expenses, the amount ofCOGS consumed by the associate's revenue produc-tion should be an expense considered when evaluat-ing the position. If the new associate's range ofservice provision will mimic that of the general prac-tice, then the practice's gross margin can be utilizedto calculate the COGS related to the new associate'sprojected revenues. Our case example assumed theassociate's service provision to mimic the practice,which carried a gross margin of 69.4% resulting inapportioned COGS that were 30.6% of revenues. If, on the other hand, the new associate's service provision will not mimic that of the general practice,a more precise assignment of COGS can only beachieved through an ABC system as previously de-scribed for use in assigning overhead. Differentsubdivisions of the revenue generation can be cre-ated based on their utilization of COGS. TheCOGS within that subdivision would be the cost pooland the revenue generation within that subdivisionwould be the cost driver for that pool. Differentcost pools within the service provision can be estab-lished based upon each pool's utilization of cost of AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 555THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEgoods. For example, physical exams and rectal pal-pations should have low cost of goods associatedwith them, whereas blood work and ancillary testingshould carry a high cost of goods. These two sce-narios would require COGS to be applied at differentrates of COGS expense against each dollar of reve-nue. To this end, different cost pools should becreated for the different classes of revenue as dic-tated by the cost of goods that goes with each class.Each dollar of revenue within each pool would stillact as the cost driver but each one would carry thecost of goods associated with that revenue pool (seeAppendix 1 for a case example). Although the differentiation of revenues into dif- ferent subdivisions depending on the cost pool beingestimated will signicantly increase the complexityof the data preparation for nancial analysis, theincrease in precision obtained through better sepa-ration of data will not only signicantly improve theaccuracy in assigning overhead costs and COGSagainst each dollar of revenue, but it will ultimatelyserve as the platform needed for a previously de-scribed method of determining the price for a proce-dure. 11And, as the example in Appendix 1 shows, a more precise analysis can better dene the prot- ability of each revenue center so that service effortsand attempts at business growth can be directed andimplemented more appropriately. 6. How Much Can I Pay the New Associate? With the information previously detailed, the busi-ness owner should be able to generate a completeforecast of the expenses expected to be incurred onbehalf of the new associate during the process ofsetting him/her up for practice and during the rstyear of employment. The ability to compare theexpected revenue production against the more pre-cise calculation of the expected expenses will createa framework that can be used to decide on a salarycompensation style and compensation amount thatwill make the situation work for the practice. Given that it would be fair and honest to give this type of investment several years to demonstrate itsnancial worthiness, the numbers calculated forrevenue and cash expenses should be forecasted forat least a 5-year period. Present Value of Cash Flows and Net Present Value of the Hiring Project The forecasted revenues and expenses, includingcompensation, will produce a net cash flow for eachof the ve forecasted years as detailed in our caseexample. Using a discount rate equivalent to thebusiness owner's risk-adjusted required rate of re-turn for an investment (25% required rate of returnfor our case example), the value of each future cashflow can be brought back into today's dollars, a con-cept better known as discounted cash flow analysis(Appendix 2). By subtracting from this estimatedpresent value of future cash flows the cash outflowfor the original investment associated with the setupand hiring expenses, one will arrive at the net pres- ent value (NPV) of the hiring project. If this valueis equal to or greater than zero, the cash flows pro-duced by the hiring will equal or surpass those thatwould be produced by the required rate of returnand the hiring project should therefore be seen asan attractive investment opportunity. Our caseexample provided a present value of future cashflows that exceeded the initial cash investment,thereby producing a positive NPV of the Project,making the hiring decision an attractive invest-ment opportunity. There will be cases in which the NPV of the project will be negative. The only ways to try to mend thisissue during the forecasting process are to reducethe projected outflow expenses (including salarycompensation), increase the projected revenue in-flows, and/or reduce the required rate of return.If an honest manipulation of these expectations stilldoes not provide a positive number for the NPV ofthe project, then hiring a new associate would not bea sound nancial decision. Internal Rate of Return An internal rate of return (IRR) analysis uses theproject's initial cash outflow and future cash flows tocalculate the discount rate that will result in a zeroNPV for the hiring project. A computed IRR thatexceeds the owner's required rate of return suggests,just like a positive NPV of the project explainedabove, that the hiring project should be viewed fa-vorably. In our case example, as expected from thepositive NPV of the Project obtained, the project'sIRR of 37.9% exceeded the required 25% rate ofreturn. The exact amount of salary compensation that can be offered, that meets the owner's required rate ofreturn, can be arrived at without the need for trial-and-error calculations by using the Solver data anal-ysis tool on Microsoft Excel. Given that theproject's NPV will be zero when the project's IRRequals the required rate of return, one can set Solverto analyze for the salary compensation amount vari-able that will provide the desired IRR result. 7. Analysis of the New Associate Hire Case Example Using a risk-adjusted required rate of return for aninvestment of 25%, the NPV and IRR of $18,500 38%, respectively (Table1). By denition, the obtained results suggestedthe hiring of the associate to be an attractive invest-ment opportunity. A signicant observation from the analysis was that, whereas a previously published article sug-gests that a generic employee's cost (base salary,employment taxes and benets) is typically in the1.25-1.4 times the base salary range, 12the new vet - erinary associate's expense-to-salary ratio hoveredbetween 1.88 and 2.01 for our case example (Table5). The primary sources for this signicance seemto be the ABC application of COGS and overhead 556 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEexpenses to the employee and the substantial ex-penses incurred by the employer associated withmileage reimbursement in an ambulatory setting. 8. Conclusion The improved methodology for calculating ex-penses provided by this paper, specically the im-plementation of an ABC system for a moreaccurate assignment of shared expenses, shouldallow for a more precise forecasting of the cashflows expected to be generated by the hired asso-ciate. Based on the owner's nancial return re-quirements, the exact salary compensation andstyle that will deliver this requirement can bedetermined so as to provide the potential associatewith a best-case scenario that is still a soundnancial decision for the business. Althoughbusiness owners should do their best to supportthe professional and nancial needs of our newcolleagues, new associates should not expect theirnancial situation to be subsidized by the shoul-ders of existing practices. In any well-run busi-ness, business decisions should be made for theprimary benet of the practice's equity and debtholders. And as the high expense to salary ratioof our case example shows, the high overall costof the associate's position makes it difcult toprovide a high salary compensation that willcompletely satisfy the new associate's desires.Prospective associates should perform their ownanalysis regarding the viability of that specic practice's job offer to meet their personal nancialneeds. A hiring project that provides a positive NPV and an IRR equal to, or greater than, the owner'srequired risk-adjusted rate of return will presentan attractive investment opportunity for the prac-tice that will provide the basis for a sound nan-cial decision. The conclusion that the investmentopportunity is an overall sound decision, however,will be dependent on the owner's ultimate combi-nation of nancial and nonnancial goals. Anyacceptance of an unfavorable investment opportu-nity, as presented through a reduced rate of re-turn, must be seen through the eyes of nancialcompromise delivered by the reduced workload forthe owner and, hopefully, the increased level ofwork-life balance that the reduced workloadshould provide.

Introduction The reasons to hire a new associate are practicedependent but are usually related to a need forpractice growth or a desire for someone within thepractice to slow down. Regardless of the reasons,the nancial implication of making a new hire mustbe analyzed, not only to evaluate whether the newassociate can generate an adequate return for thepractice owner's investment into the position, butalso to determine the effect that the new hire willhave on the nances of the rest of the practice.The practice owner would then be able to review thenancial results in light of the personal reasons forthe hire. Based on existing nancial data and knowledge of the practice, a practice owner should be able to fore-cast a 5-10-year period of expected revenues andcash outflows for the original practice, and should beable to forecast the net cash flows for the new asso-ciate position based on the position's expected reve-nue production and associated expenses. The endresult should be the ability to forecast equity cashflows for both the original ongoing practice and thenew practice had it hired the associate. Equitycash flows are utilized for simplicity given that they are those that do not include cash inflows or outflowsrelated to interest or debt, and represent the cashavailable to the owners of the business. If one wereto utilize the practice's cost of equity (the owner'sexpected compensation for owning the practice andbearing the risk of owning the practice) as the dis-count rate for the performance of a discounted cashflow analysis, the present value of the estimatedfuture cash flows can be calculated for both scenar-ios; a process that would provide a simple dis-counted cash flow valuation of the equity of theoriginal practice and of the new practice had it hiredthe associate. 2. Forecasting the Original Practice Data regarding the practice's revenue, gross mar-gin percentage, operating expenses related toemployee and employer benets, and operatingexpenses related to overhead should be availablethrough studying of the practice's nancial state-ments. Analysis of these statements should pro-vide information regarding the growth trend foreach line item. The combination of the aboveshould allow for the forecasting of the expected AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 559THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICE NOTEScash flows not associated with interest or debt forthe original practice. Utilizing the practice's costof equity as a discount rate (the author uses10.41% for most of his analysis), one can then ndthe present value of the expected future cashflows, thereby arriving at a simple valuation of thepractice's equity (Appendix). The case examplepresented in Table 1 shows the forecasted equitycash flows of an existing practice for a 6-yearperiod (the cash available to the owner of thepractice after all cash expenses have been in-curred). In essence, the calculated present valueof future cash flows implies that to achieve a10.41% rate of return for that 6-year period, thepractice's equity is worth $520,351. 3. Forecasting the New Associate's Net Cash Flows Based on individual practice knowledge, a practiceowner will have to make a projection of the reve-nues expected to be produced by the new associateand the growth pattern of this production over theforecasted period. If one assumes that the newassociate's service provision will mimic that of theoriginal practice, expenses associated with cost ofgoods sold (COGS) and overhead expenses can beassigned based on a percent of revenue as dictatedby the original practice's nancials. Expenses forsalary compensation, business and personal ben-ets, vehicle provision or mileage reimbursement,retirement contribution matching, FICA andFUTA and state unemployment taxes, and forworker's compensation should also be calculatedfor the new position, and each line item's growthtrend over the forecasted years must be dened.By deducting the forecasted expenses from theforecasted revenues, one will arrive at the ex-pected net cash flow that would be contributed bythe new associate to the practice in each of theforecasted years. 4. Changes to the Original Forecast Respondents to a recent nonscientic survey ofmembers of the American Association of EquinePractitioners Business Rounds Discussion Group 1 expressed that on average they expected that 74%of a new associate's production would come fromthe transfer of already-provided service by theoriginal practice. This means that the originalpractice's forecasted revenue for Year 1 wouldhave to be reduced by the amount transferred tothe associate. The forecast exercise would nowdictate that the expected revenue growth used forthe original practice would have to be applied tothe new, lower expected revenue production by the practice after taking into account the revenuetransfer to the new associate. In addition, theassigning of COGS and overhead expenses tothe practice would essentially represent the left-over expenses from the practice's total expense foreach line item after taking into account the sharedportion assigned to the new associate. The fore-casting of expenses for existing employee andemployer benets should, in theory, remain un-changed from that which was originally calcu-lated. Lastly, each yearly cash flow projected forthe practice would need to be adjusted by theyearly net cash flow forecasted for the new asso-ciate, so that the total practice's equity cash flowcan be obtained for each of the forecasted years.The obtained results will allow for a comparisonbetween forecasted cash flows for the practice thathas hired the associate and the original one.Furthermore, the present value of the estimatedfuture cash flows for the practice with the associ-ate can be calculated using the previously deneddiscount rate, allowing the owner to observe thechange in the overall practice's equity value basedon the hiring of the new associate. Table 2 shows the forecasted equity cash flows for the practice based on a reduced amount ofrevenue production after transferring of serviceprovision to the new associate who started in Year2 and for whom an equipment purchasing cashexpense was incurred in Year 1. After adding theincremental equity cash flow provided by the as-sociate's service provision, we arrive at the newpractice's overall equity cash flow and the presentvalue of those cash flows based on a 10.41% re-quired rate of return. The reason why the new practice's forecast must be performed based on two different parts is becausenot only will the expected revenue growth differbetween the new associate's production and that ofthe original practice, but the assigning of COGS andoverhead expenses might differ between both enti-ties if the associate's service provision were not tomimic that of the general practice. The separationof data enables the generation of a more preciseforecast of cash flows for each of the practice's parts,which in turn provides a more precise valuation ofthe total practice's equity. 5. Expected Results The percent of the associate's service provisionthat constitutes a transfer from the practice willhave a signicant effect on the resulting presentTable 1.

The end result isthat the practice's overall expenses get reduced ata lower rate than its revenues, and therefore thepractice's resulting equity cash flow becomes alower percentage of revenues when compared withthe percentage that the original practice wouldhave generated. Compounding the issue of the reduction in cash flow production by the practice is the fact that thenew associate's expenses compared with the posi-tion's revenue generation, will be greater than theratio of expenses to revenue generation expectedfrom longer standing veterinarians within the prac-tice. Although scenarios will be presented in theinitial years in which the new position contributes apositive net cash flow to the practice, the amountprovided will most likely fail to counteract the effectcreated by the practice's cash flows becoming a lowerpercentage of revenues secondary to the transfer ofrevenue generation. Only when the new associ-ate's net cash flow contribution surpasses this effectwill the practice's yearly cash flows exceed the cashflows that would have been provided by the originalpractice; this being the turning point signifying thathaving the associate is producing greater cash flowsthan could have been generated without havingdone the hire. The presented case example in Tables 1 and 2 shows a scenario in which the value of the prac-tice's equity over the analyzed 6-year period wasreduced from $520,351 to $368,005 by adding thenew associate. Although the new associate posi-tion was deemed an attractive investment oppor-tunity by an analysis presented by the author onanother paper, 2analyzing the effect of the new position on the practice's overall nances shows the hiring to not be a sound nancial decision.The main source for the reduction comes from thehigh percent of service provision by the new asso-ciate that came from transferring of existing ser-vice provision by the practice (74% in this case based on survey results). In essence, only 26% ofthe associate's production was new revenue thatcould not counteract the increased cash outflowsrelated to having the new position. 6. Conclusion Although a nancial analysis for hiring a new asso-ciate might provide evidence that the hiring offersan attractive investment opportunity for the prac-tice, this opportunity must be additionally analyzedbased on the effects that the new hire will have onthe nances of the rest of the practice. The percentof the new associate's revenue generation that is atransfer of existing service provision will have asignicant effect on the practice's nances. Afterdoing the hire, the higher the percent of the associ-ate's revenue generation that comes as a transfer of service, the greater that the practice's total cashflows will lag the cash flows that would have beenproduced by the original practice. Proper revenuegrowth of the new associate's position should enablethe reversal of this nancially unsound scenario.The calculation of the present value of future cashflows will be the measurement that will denewhether the hiring is a sound nancial decision.Although the initial years' cash flows will mostlikely be reduced in the practice, an increase in cashflows in future years could effectively make the netpresent value of all of the cash flows be worth morethan the cash flows that would have been producedby the original practice. Ultimately, the practiceowner must weigh the nancial results of the anal-ysis against his/her reason for wanting the hire inthe rst place.

DiGrassie, DVM, MS, DACT There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes that you never see as an associate or student to start apractice and make it successful. You should never assume you can always run a practice better, and beprepared to make mistakes and grow from them to become successful. Author's address: MountainView \u00a9 2016AAEP. 1. Introduction No matter whether you decide to start practice own-ership straight out of school or later in your career,it is a large undertaking but well worth the strugglein the end. My husband and I, like a lot of associateveterinarians, thought we could run a business bet-ter than our boss and decided to leave the comfort ofa steady paycheck for the uncertainty of ownership.We felt condent we could reinvent the wheel betterand learned a lot of valuable lessons over the past 13years that helped our practice go from the brink ofclosure to back in the black! 2. Lesson 1: \"Don't Build the Taj Mahal in Rural Southwestern Virginia\" We made the mistake of building bigger than thearea could support initially. It was not because thedemographics could not support the clinic but be-cause the horse owners were not used to all the bellsand whistles. It took years to start to convincepeople to use new techniques and new tools. Thebiggest mistake was installing a magnetic resonanceimaging machine too soon right before the recessionhit. Even though we did get a good deal on theunit, in our area of the country it is still not payingfor itself. We have grown the service through time and education. Things to Consider 1. When starting to either build a facility or even just set up an ambulatory truck, do yourhomework. Sometimes there is no veterinar-ian in the area because all the past veterinar-ians have gone bankrupt in that area and theeconomy cannot support an equine-onlyveterinarian. 2. Do not expect all horse locals to be able to support a clinic that will have all the bells andwhistles. Even if an area can support thetechnology, do not assume they will. Youwill need to educate them over time the ben-et of what you have to offer as will be dis-cussed later in this article. 3. If the area you have to settle in is such an area, just remember it is better to start offsmall and grow with your clientele thenstart big and go bankrupt. Go to your countygovernment center and local extension ofceto determine the demographics of the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 563THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICE NOTESarea. Also ask local businesses that may ser- vice the horse community. They will give yousome invaluable advice as to what the areacan support. 3. Lesson 2: \"Love thy Paperwork\" No one ever prepares you for the amount of paper-work that is involved in setting up a business.There are permits and hoops to go through to start afacility and licenses to apply for to even begin anambulatory practice. You need business licenses,documents of incorporation, Drug Enforcement Ad-ministration (DEA) licenses, inspections and ap-provals from your board of veterinary medicine,radiograph machine inspections, badges, and the listgoes on. It took more time and money than weoriginally expected. Also, never expect your facilityto be done on time. We had the monsoon of thecentury while our clinic was being built, which set usback 6 months from opening the doors, which is along time to go without income. We had to impro-vise to get through it by starting certain servicesearly before completion. Things to Consider 1. Contact the board of veterinary medicine and county government center as soon as you startto think about opening a business. They canhelp guide you through the paperwork youneed to get started. 2. Be prepared to spend more initially than ex- pected: approximately 10% more becauseyou never know what the county might throwat you next. 3. Plan for setbacks and be prepared before you stop generating that steady paycheck andsave, save, save for that rainy day. I wouldtry to save enough to cover your bills for 6months before venturing out on your own. 4. Lesson 3: \"The Internet is Your Friend\" Let's face it: we all want all the new fancy toyswith all the bells and whistles, but those toys add upin price and just may not t into your bud-get. When we started our practice we knew therewere certain pieces of equipment we had to have torun a full-service hospital. We began looking allover at the costs and were sticker shocked. Whenwe gured out we just could not afford that new$50,000 /H11001arthroscopy unit we started looking on- line. I was surprised to nd all the refurbishedequipment online. We got a very nice Dyonics sys-tem complete for only $5,000. Now I will say beaware and read the ne print because you do notwant to buy something that is not in working orderor has not been refurbished. We ended up buying alot of equipment off the Internet to start our busi-ness and saved thousands of dollars and most of ourequipment has lasted 10 or more years. If you donot like the exact item go to their online store orother items they sell. This is how we contacted a couple of used equipment dealers that found exactlywhat we needed. Things to Consider 1. Looking online can save you a lot of money when looking to buy certain high-priced piecesof equipment. 2. Buyers beware. The lesson here is that you can nd a lot of great stuff cheaper online butread the ne print and do your home-work. Make sure the equipment is in work-ing order and comes with a return policy if itarrives nonfunctional. 3. It is important to research if you can still nd someone to x the unit. Also, if there aredisposables needed, make sure they are stillavailable. Contact the manufacturer for thatinformation. 5. Lesson 4: \"Let's Make a Deal\" Is Not Always the Right Deal Ever wish you could go back in time and get a do-over? We all have those moments where you arein the halls of the American Association of EquinePractitioners trade show and the deals they start totell you about that new product seem too good to betrue, and sometimes they are. Do not get suckedinto the vaccine deal that allows you to get 3000doses of vaccine and not pay for them until April andmaking four easy monthly payments unless youknow that come April you will be able to shell out themoney in a lump sum of $5000 or more for that bigorder and you can sell all of it. Also, watch startuppractice deals on drugs and supplies. We did thestartup deal and they made all sorts of recommen-dations as to what you will need and how much.It sounds great when you are a new owner and donot have a clue what to order, but I can tell you I stillhave more activated charcoal then I will ever use ina lifetime. Things to Consider 1. It is always better to start off with small or- ders and the drugs you know you will use a lotof and be able to use all of before the expira-tion date. 2. If you do not have a clue what you may need then phone another colleague that you cantrust to advise you on what to order. 3. Deals are great at these trade shows but make sure you have the cash to back it up. Budgetfor those monthly payments that need to comeout of the account 4-6 months from now. 4. Make sure you can sell most of the product you buy within 6-9 months. If you cannot,consider setting up an online pharmacythrough your distributor and link to your Web 564 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEsite to handle those nonessentials your client may want. 6. Lesson 5: \"If You Build It, They Will Come\" The Field of Dreams does not exist without hardwork. You cannot expect to build a state-of-the-artfacility and for people to just walk in and start usingyour services right away. You do need to advertise.When we rst came to town none of the veterinaryhospitals in our area advertised. It was taboo.I grew up in the restaurant business and I knew theimportance of advertisement and began with printadvertisements in local horse magazines. We alsodid feature advertisements during breeding seasonshowcasing our stallions. I wrote articles for localhorse journals on a monthly basis about health care,gave seminars at every little group there was, andset up booths at events and horse shows. Thefunny thing is that the other clinics started to followsuit and now lots of veterinarians in our area adver-tise. It started to pay off and then it took off, notwith more advertising but by word of mouth fromhappy clients. The word on the street then tookover as more people wanted to come to us to x theirhorse because we xed Mr. Smith's horse down theroad. Things to Consider 1. Advertising is essential with any new busi- ness. Write articles and blogs, handoutcards at events, and give away hats or shirtswith your name and logo. 2. Offer to speak to local horse groups and get their email addresses. You can then send outelectronic newsletters, blogs, etc. 3. Nowadays social media is the best way to get the word out rather than print advertisement.Start a Facebook page, Web site, twitter, etc.to help people nd you and help you educateyour clientele. 4. If you like to trail ride, show horses, or just even go watch, go. The best way I have foundto get clients is to socialize on their turf\u2014horse shows. We now have clients come fromout of state because of our commitment to thehorse showing industry. 5. If you do not want to show, offer to be the veterinarian for a show for free and make sureto show up and socialize. Trust me, it works. 7. Lesson 6: \"Know When to Say When\" Read my lips: You are not a lending institution.In the equine eld it is hard to collect for servicesrendered. Why? A lot of times it is because theowner is not present at the boarding/training barn,and second, we do not like to talk money withoutfear of offending someone. Have you heard theline, \"It's my favorite horse!\" or expenses,\" etc....? I will admit ittugs on the heart strings because we truly got intothis business for the love of the animal. We learned the hard way just like a lot of new veterinarians.At one point we had more than $150,000 in accountsreceivable and were close to bankruptcy even thoughwe were still fairly busy. We had to make sometough decisions in our practice and a few clients left,but now we gross just as much, net more, and workfewer hours. The rst thing I did was get two solidemployees to work the front and back of the clinic.The receptionist has her sweet southern charm butwhile she is sweet talking you, she is also gettingthat credit card number before we even go to thefarm. Our account collector works part time for usand her main job is a medical bill collector, which isthe best type of person to have in this position.She has the best way to get people to at least makemonthly payments. Finally, I take people to court.In the state of Virginia it is easy to take someone tosmall claims court, if you go out 90 days with noeffort to pay, no contact, etc. When I get the judg-ment, I turn it in to the sheriff to take items toauction. I have gotten many bills paid off becausesomeone did not want to lose their boat. So now myaccounts receivable is $30,000 with $20,000 in the30 days or less category, not bad for a practice thatgrosses more than a million dollars annually. Things to Consider 1. Bottom line when you start your practice, get payment up front. We take cash, check,credit cards, or care credit. No paymentplans unless they plan to pay once at the endof the month and only for select accounts. 2. Get qualied staff to make the appointments and collect the debt if you allow charging. Donot hesitate to insist on payment and col-lect; do not go bankrupt being nice becausethey will nd another veterinarian when youare gone. 3. Charges and invoices should be sent out that day or the next at the latest. This way you donot miss charges and the visit is still fresh intheir mind. Emailed invoices work best. 4. As soon as an account goes over 30 days, start sending email and phone call remind-ers. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. 5. If all attempts have been made with no pay- ment or contact send them to court and sus-pend business with them. 8. Final Lesson: \"Let it Go!\" You will never make everyone happy in your prac-tice, whether it be an employee, associate veterinar-ian, or client. No matter whom it is, do not let itweigh you down. Life is too short. In equine re-ferral hospitals and even ambulatory, employees getburned out and may want to leave. I learned that ifthey have decided to leave, let them go immediately.There is nothing worse than an employee that isunhappy at your practice and recruiting your cli- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 565THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEents?. Do the best you can by offering competitivepay, benets, time off, and ask them what they need.If they still are not happy then it is time to let themgo and nd someone else because you will nevermake them happy. Clients also sometimes leaveand get second opinions or just get along with an-other veterinarian better. Just know we give greatservice, have state-of-the-art equipment and facili-ties, and have the knowledge base. Not every clientis the right client for your practice but may be agreat one for someone else's. You need to knowthat when you start a practice you get a lot of priceshoppers that once they realize you don't extendcredit and aren't going to just do it for free they willmove on to the next new practice. Let them go.You will be happier in the end. Things to Consider 1. Talk to your employees and see what is mak- ing them unhappy and try to make it betterbut if you have done all you can and nothingchanges, let them go. 2. If a client wants a second opinion, do not be offended, let them get one. You would be sur-prised that a lot of them come back again later. 3. If the client is not happy let them go. Get the clientele that will appreciate your servicesover the Internet and local experts. But al-ways ask your clients how you can improveyour service before you let them go for good. Bottom line: There is a lot you do not know about practice ownership, because the only way to learnsometimes is making mistakes. Hopefully, learn-ing from others' mistakes will help you make less inthe future. There is nothing more satisfying thanowning a successful practice, just make sure you areprepared to take the plunge and enjoy.

You must transition early, and have a signicantpresence in social media such as Facebook, prior to calling on society for help in these situations. Au-thors' address: Adelaide Plains Equine Clinic, 1951 Two Wells Australia;e-mail: ewhdvm@internode.on.net. *Corresponding and presenting author. \u00a9 2016 1. Introduction As social media becomes an ever-more-present forcein our lives, veterinary practices are rapidly makingthe transition from traditional client contacts to Fa-cebook, Twitter, and Instagram for communications.Social media should be seen as a useful tool forpractice and can be used for much more than justmarketing and education. In January 2015 a bush re in our practice area in South Australia burned 49,000 acres over 2 days.Our clinic put out a message on Facebook that wehad room for 10 horses. We took in 30 the rstnight. For comparison, in September 2015 a forestre near Middletown, California burned 77,000acres in 2 days. In late November 2015, here againin our practice area in South Australia, a bush reburned 225,000 acres in 5 hours. People literallyran for their lives leaving stock to fend for them-selves. Again, we put out a message on Facebookthat we would be happy to take horses that weredisplaced or injured by the re. In the January re the horses were not burned, and the owners had sufcient time to get the horsesout before the re approached. The horses werestressed, and a few had colic from relocation to un- familiar locations, lack of water the initial night,and excessive unfamiliar feed presented upon ar-rival at various facilities. Many regular clientscalled and wanted to help with the care of the horseshoused at our clinic. We initially declined the offer,but we relented when they showed up anyway ask- ing to help with simple things like feeding and clean-ing yards. Approximately eight volunteers helpedduring the January weekend, and then a few wereable to continue during the week before we gradu-ally sent the horses home after 7 days. In the November re many horses died or were euthanized due to the severity of their burns. Ourpersonal staff lost a total of ve horses in the re.Three of us went out and saw many clients' andstaffs' horses behind the blockade and euthanizedone client's horse that night. Of the horses we sawon the night of the re, 12 with severe burns came toour clinic. The burns were primarily legs, ventralabdomen, muzzles, and eyes. Almost all of thehorses had corneal ulcers. Within 48 hours of the disaster, a small army of volunteers had been mobilized, with more than 80 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 567THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICE NOTESoffers of assistance. Some could only come for anhour or two, but in the early phase we would start at7:00 a.m. and not nish the treatments and cleaninguntil 2:00 p.m. There would be an hour break andeveryone was asked to leave (to prevent them stay-ing and developing fatigue), then a second group ofvolunteers would come at 3:00 p.m. to start theafternoon medications, cleaning, and feeding. It also quickly became apparent that nancing the care of these extremely intensive patients was wellbeyond our clinic and the horse owners' capabilities,and we had to seek other sources of funding. Thisarticle aims to share our experiences and advice forutilizing social media during a disaster, and how itcan be a useful tool for organizing volunteers, sourc-ing and promoting funding, and communicatingwith colleagues. 2. Management of Volunteers We realized that we could not cope with the needs ofthe horses with just our staff. Two of our staff hadlost homes or horses and were unable to come towork. One of our two veterinarians and a nursewere away treating animals for distant clients.We had eight severely burned horses as well asfour with minor burns. Initially on Facebook wecalled for volunteers to phone with their interest;however, our phone line was quickly swamped, andwe edited our request for volunteers to contact usthrough messages to the practice page. There were greater than 80 offers of help, which ranged from young horse owners, retirees, veteri-nary nurses from small animal practices, humanburn nurses, veterinary students, and a few col-leagues. We grouped them as far as hours avail-able and skill levels. Many of the people whooffered their assistance had no prior exposure tohorses, and although their offers of help were appre-ciated, their presence would have been either tootime consuming for our staff or potentially dangerous.We usually focused on those with horse-handling ex-perience, and politely declined the rest. For 3-4 weeks we rotated eight to ten volunteers at a time for a morning session and then another veto six in the afternoon. All the volunteers wouldaccept any task from cleaning stalls to cleaning orholding the sedated horses for daily bandagechanges. Key volunteers were identied and weregiven permission to perform veterinary tasks undersupervision, given that only one veterinarian waspresent at any one time due to scheduled commit-ments. These rosters were organized using peo-ple's availabilities they provided in Facebookmessages to our page. Volunteers' skills were maximized by teaming ex- perienced horse people with experienced burns ornursing people, whereas others were grouped intofeeders, cleaners, and horse holders. The veteri-narians did very little hands-on work after the rstfew days, given that the volunteers self organizedvery quickly and rarely did anything they were notqualied to do. They respected each other's knowl- edge and experience. We were concerned about insurance, and we called our business insurance provider and found weneeded a policy to cover the volunteers. The policywas not expensive and was put into place immedi-ately to provide cover. We tried to do daily updates on Facebook to keep up the interest of donators and volunteers. Werarely had pictures of our staff, and tried to makesure all of the volunteers were in a picture at leastonce. This is not an easy task as several were cam-era shy. We did group pictures at least once a weekand featured them in the postings. As such weimplemented a policy that all volunteers agreed tonot post specic information (posts or pictures) ofindividual cases without approval by one of our vet-erinarians. We did not want owners to get newinformation on their horses via Facebook. Volun-teers were very receptive, and understanding of this,and we had no further issues. As the horses went home we found that the vol- unteers were disappointed that their responsibili-ties were gone and they were not needed. We heardseveral times that the volunteers were grateful forthe experience, and felt they had not done enough.In the end we had a barbeque for all the volunteersand gave them hats with our logo and a volunteer-survivor message. Although we still had one horsein the clinic, by sharing our thank you event onsocial media it acted as a nale for our army ofvolunteers, donators and supporters. Key points: Volunteer support can be quickly overwhelm- ing in a disaster situation. Encourage poten-tial volunteers to communicate via theMessages section of a Facebook page ratherthan phoning, to maintain an open line to thepractice. Acknowledgment of volunteers' efforts via posts and photos on social media provides in-stant gratication of their work and also en-courages them to engage with the page. Adopt a policy during the situation to handle volunteers' posts regarding individual cases. Check with your insurance provider to ensure you have coverage for volunteers. Most poli-cies either include cover or have very-cost ef-fective additional policies. 3. Clinical Advice From Colleagues Two very experienced volunteers were a burns-specialist nurse who also had horses, and a burnsspecialist human doctor who was nominated forAustralian of the Year for his work in human-burnspatients. They heard about our plight through Fa-cebook. The doctor was dealing with the burnedhuman patients from the same re, but came to visitthe horses and give advice. Their help was invalu- 568 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEable in treating these horses and suggesting eco-nomical ways to clean and bandage legs. Two equine veterinarians who had dealt with Aus- tralian grass re burns also called and gave adviceon the peculiarities, prognosis, and treatment of theburns we saw. There was conflicting advice fromthe various practices seeing burned horses abouttreatments such as icing the legs after the initialday, so getting perspectives from other more experi-enced sources helped us decide which course to take.None of us had dealt with this type of injury on sucha massive scale before. Without our engagement insocial media, many of these colleagues would nothave been aware of our direct involvement in thedisaster and we might not have received as muchuseful advice. 4. Generation and Management of Funding As treatments began, it quickly became evident thatwe needed outside ways to nance this as the own-ers would not be able to pay for the treatments intheir current state of losses. Phone calls from col-leagues and messages from experienced veterinaryemergency response team leaders suggested westart a fund to treat the animals. There is a vast range of funding sites such as IndieGogo and Crowdrise, but we chose GoFundMe,based on personal recommendations. The rstmorning after the re we set up an account thatwould help in the initial phase of the treatments andsupplies needed. There are several funding sitesavailable, but this was simple and would be easyfor people who lived out of the country to donate.GoFundMe takes a percentage ( /H110117-8%), plus 30 cents per donation to manage the fund, and thenmoney is sent directly to a designated bank accountalmost daily. The GoFundMe site had a list of do-nors, and we were able to thank each one individu-ally, which we did by email. We put regularupdates on the GoFundMe site so the donors whowere not regular Facebook followers could see theprogress of the horses. The downside is that this can easily be used for fraud. We monitored other GoFundMe sites thatmentioned our name and promised to give themoney to us. If we knew them we would ask themnot to associate with us and most did comply andstopped their well-meaning sites. We suspect thatthere were a few that were not going to be so benev-olent, so we made it clear on Facebook that ourGoFundMe site was the only one through which wewere accepting money. Some donators wanted toavoid the percentage lost in the fund transactionand donated directly to our bank account, and wefound that this proportion of donors increased overtime. With this scheme we were able to keep up on the nancial drain due to the needs of this project.Our rst bill for medical supplies, which was onlythe last 5 days of the month, was $10,000 abovewhat we normally expect. As we were windingdown, however, and sending the less-critical horses home, we realized that some of the cost of caring forthe horses was not going to present for 6 months ormore, such as the water bill. We knew there wereother bills like this that would make this a verycostly exercise. Almost 2 months into the project we received a notice that we had been nominated to receive a$10,000 grant from an Australian bank. A distantFacebook follower worked at the bank and wasaware of what we were doing through regular up-dates on Facebook, and she nominated us for theaward. We were dubious, but to our surprise, oneday $10,000 was placed in our bank account. Another good source of funds was a group of stal- lion owners who donated their stallions' services athalf price, and then all the money was directed toour clinic or other practices dealing with burnedhorses. We wanted to make sure that we were not in- cluded in any rumors of misappropriation of moneycollected, so we set up a special account in our billingsoftware just for the burned horses, and we applieddonations and expenses to that account and anyonecould come and see what we did with the money.We did not spend any money for personal food oranything that did not benet the horses directly.Even our \"volunteer thank you\" party was from ourown sources. Key points: Establishing an online funding account takes a lot of the administrative hassle out of accept-ing donations. We found GoFundMe to bestraightforward and transparent. It also of-fered convenient solutions for thankingdonors. Online funding accounts can be easily shared with a clinic Facebook page, and also updatedfor donors not on social media. Monitor pop-up accounts claiming to be donat- ing money to the clinic. Donors like options, and direct donations to your clinic bank account is also a valid option.Consider the added time for administering thisavenue before offering it. 5. Other Donations As mentioned previously, some of the rst phonecalls were from colleagues offering advice about thetypes of injuries and potential problems we wouldface in the next few weeks. That was invaluable.One Facebook friend and colleague who had beenthrough this himself, mentioned that he receivedmoney and donations of silver sulfadiazine topicalcream from colleagues a few years ago, and hewanted to pass on the favor and sent us a largequantity. As people heard about our plight through social media, we were inundated with products of all kinds AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 569THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEfrom bandages impregnated with silver, to honeyand aloe vera gels. If we needed something thatthe general public could get, we would mention it onFacebook and we would be inundated with supplies.We used some products they donated, but as a rule,most with no listed ingredients were not used.In one case we started to use sorbolene for softeningthe skin and preventing cracking. We mentionedthis in an update and then received 180 L of theproduct. Tack, bandaging items, and especiallyfood were distributed to horse owners, and volun-teers. Drug and supplier companies also heardabout our needs through Facebook updates and tensof thousands of dollars of products such as silversulfadiazine topical cream, flunixin, phenylbuta-zone, bandages, and other products were donated. When we were certain we had nished with the products, and we heard about other res and veter-inary needs (again, through Facebook), we sent theexcess to other clinics. In one case we donated asimilar value of money from our rst colleague'sdonation, to the supplier of another veterinaryclinic, so they could buy what they needed for theirre-affected horses. The November res unfortunately also occurred during a heat wave, and due to the now-very-impaired barrier function of our patients' skin, wehad extreme difculty keeping them cool. Therewas also a signicant safety risk for our staff andvolunteers performing treatments for hours a day in35-40\u00b0C (95-104\u00b0F) heat. Another company dis-covered our plight via our Facebook posts and do-nated three industrial-sized evaporative coolers,free of charge with no expiry period, and deliveredand installed them at their own cost. 6. Facebook Utilization We had what we thought was a good presence onFacebook prior to the November bushre, with justunder 2000 likes on our business page, which weattributed to the regular informative posts on localtopics and the sharing of outside horse related posts.The posts on local topics such as poisonous plants,current outbreaks, and items that affect our clientswere one of the keys to building this presence.If we wrote a post on a local topic the viewing ratewould be in the thousands. If we copied and shareda post from a colleague or magazine the \"likes\"would be approximatey 100. It is important to takethe time to present local informative topics that areshared by the readers. If we asked a client to allowus to share a case in which their horse was thesubject, it would be very rare that they woulddecline. Early on we asked the owners of the burned horses if they were willing to sacrice anonymity sowe could promote the needs of the horses throughsocial media, and the Internet, and they were morethan happy with this arrangement. The rst Face-book post on the condition of the horses after the rehad reached 8000 people and was shared more than1000 times. Within a few days of our initial posts on the horses, our page \"likes\" went from 2000 to4000 and has stayed there. As already discussed, Facebook was a powerful tool for rallying and organizing our volunteers, shar-ing and generating donations, as well as notifyingand communicating with colleagues. Along withcalling for volunteers and sharing our funding site,our daily posts with pictures and video were crucialto encouraging viewer sentiment and engaging thepublic in the trials and tribulations of our patients.Our posts averaged 400-500 words and were accom-panied with an average of seven photos. Videoswere also infrequently used, and were often short(10-30 seconds) to allow direct upload via Facebook. Monitoring the staggering numbers of comments on the page was somewhat of an impossibility, butwas important as it revealed the differences in howwe, as veterinarians vs the public, perceive what wesee. We did have a few people with negative com-ments such as why were we putting these horsesthrough this ordeal. We have found that acknowl-edging their concerns in a polite and courteous man-ner was the best way to deal with this. We invitedthese people to come and visit the horses. Whetherwe won them over or not is questionable, but at leastthey did not troll and slam us repeatedly. Key points: A reasonable \"like\" base for a business Face- book page is necessary prior to utilization in adisaster. \"Likes\" can be generated through sharing of content from other pages; however, informa-tion relevant to your geographical locationand/or practice focus is most powerful. Posts must be kept short for engagement, but contain plentiful information to explain at-tachments such as pictures and videos. While monitoring all comments during a situ- ation such as this is almost impossible, nega-tive comments should be handled promptlyand individually. A polite and courteous re-sponse, with an offer of engagement is oftensufcient. Blatantly abusive comments shouldbe removed. 7. Other Social Media Sites The practice has successfully utilized other forms ofsocial media, namely YouTube, in the past. YouTubeallows for upload of video(s) to the website, whichcan then be viewed and shared. This is useful asuploading long videos to Facebook can take ex-tended periods of data transfer, whereas sharing avideo already uploaded to YouTube is quick andeasy. Most videos were kept short during this di-saster for direct upload to Facebook, and YouTubewas not utilized. In a quick poll on Facebook we asked whether the people following us used Twitter or Instagram. 570 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEWe found that only 1 in 5 (20%) people had, orcurrently, used anything but Facebook. Althoughthis is by any means a biased poll, given that we areonly sampling those already using Facebook, we didnd that the users of Twitter and Instagram tendedto be young. With greater than 1.5 billion usersworldwide, compared with 300-400 thousand usersindividually for Twitter and Instagram, 1we have always found Facebook to be a superior social mediasite for our business. 8. Conclusion Without our initial presence on Facebook none ofthis would have been possible. You must have abig-enough base to be able to \"get the word out\"about your needs in a disaster, and hence transition-ing to social media early will result in maximalbenet. Although Facebook or social media can beyour worst nightmare if not handled well, it can beyour friend as well. It allowed us to fund the care ofall the animals well beyond the owners' or our abil-ities. We did sacrice privacy, but it was worth itin the end. We had to learn to let go of the day-to- day hands-on control of the treatments, but in theend we have new respect for individuals who juststepped up and did what had to be done in a verydifcult situation. Make sure you are insured.Acknowledge the work of the volunteers above anywork of your paid staff and yourself.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 571THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEComposting as an Environmentally Responsible, Economically Viable Equine Carcass DisposalMethod Michelle Melaragno*; and Kimberly Anne May, DVM, MS Composting provides an environmentally responsible and cost-effective alternative for disposal ofequine carcasses, compared with methods such as ground burial and cremation. Composting hasalso proven to be an acceptable alternative to owners as opposed to landll disposal or render-ing. Authors' Equine carcass disposal can present dilemmaswhere local regulations or limited options place re-strictions on horse owners seeking suitable methodsof respectfully disposing of their companion horse'sbody after death. Due to the size of the carcass,owners have limited means of transportation anddisposal compared with the relative ease of theseprocesses for small animals. Chemical euthanasiaof the horse may further limit the horse owner'salternatives due to concerns about environmentalcontamination or unintentional poisoning. 1,2Com - mon options available to horse owners may vary with region but may include below-ground burial,2-4 cremation,5,6alkaline hydrolysis,7,8rendering,9-12 and landll disposal.13 Composting, also as above-ground burial, offers a cost-effective and environmentallyresponsible option for equine carcass disposal. Themethod can be performed onsite or at designatedfacilities. Additional benets include the ability toutilize waste bedding, which is often readily avail- able on horse properties; low cost compared withcremation; and the production of a usable end prod-uct (compost), which provides environmental benetand allows the composting area to be reused. Thecomposting process produces acceptable degradationof barbiturate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatoryresidues, reducing environmental risk. 14-22 The purpose of this presentation is to provide the results of 3 years of composting equine mortalities,including the management of composting on a largescale. 2. Materials and Methods A commercial equine carcass composting businessa was founded in Auburn, Maine in 2012 in responseto increasing interest in environmentally responsi-ble alternatives for disposal. Equine mortalitieswere collected from properties using handling meth-ods based on Technical Large Animal EmergencyRescue btechniques and using equipment such as the Large Animal Rescue Glidecand Rescue Strapsd 572 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICE NOTESto demonstrate compassion and respect for the hu-man-animal bond. The composting process wasbased on the content of a certication program of-fered by the Maine Compost School. eThe facility operates according to guidelines established in the Compost Management Plan developed by the MaineDepartment of Agriculture, in accordance with bestmanagement practices 19and Maine Chapter 211 guidelines.20 Once transported to the composting facility, the carcasses were composted in windrows using a Pre-condition and Turn method. 19,21Where individual composting was requested by the client, the horse was composted in a pile by itself to allow the entireamount of the end product to be returned to theclient. Best practices for composting animal mor-talities were used, including careful monitoring ofwindrow internal temperatures. 19,21 Horse carcasses were composted in windrows that were pyramid-shaped in cross section to allow forshedding of precipitation; create an internal envi-ronment to facilitate the aerobic, thermophilic de-composition process; provide for air inflow into thebase of the pile and the formation of a venting \"chim-ney\" at the top of the pile (Fig. 1). Bulking material, the substrate used for the com- posting process, consisted of used horse bedding(primarily coarse shavings and sawdust, with hay,manure, and urine-soaked bedding mixed in) ob-tained from local stables. The bulking materialwas stored in a separate pile and available for im-mediate use. An approximately 24-in. base of bulk-ing material was placed over a gravel bed surfaceusing a tractor with a front-loading bucket. fThe carcass was placed in lateral position, with limbs tucked close to ventral body surface when possible,on top of the base (Fig. 2). The carcass was thencovered with a minimum of 24 inches of the samebedding material used for the base of the pile.During winter months, an additional 6-12 inches ofbulking material coverage was used to insulate thepile and ensure temperatures were maintained.Once the carcasses were placed in the windrow, internal pile temperatures gwere recorded daily to ensure that the compost reached a minimum of 131\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) at a 3-foot depth in the pile for aminimum of 3 days to meet requirements for patho-gen destruction 19,21(Fig. 3 ). Once the required minimum was obtained, in-pile and ambient envi-ronmental temperatures were recorded one to twotimes weekly. The piles were not disturbed until4-5 months after the carcasses were deposited; atthat time, a tractor with a front-load bucket wasused to \"turn\" the windrow by fully mixing the con-tents of the windrow with additional bulking mate-rial to start a second heating cycle and to form asecond windrow. Bones were mixed back into thenew windrow and the windrow was capped with 4-6inches of bedding to address any potential odor inthe newly turned pile. Temperatures were againmonitored daily for 7 days and the windrow wasturned again at 2-4-week intervals until the activecomposting phase had ended. Windrows were thenscreened to eliminate bones, and the piles wereplaced in a curing phase. Fig. 1. Diagram of equine carcass compost pile construc- tion.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 62 /H114082016 573THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICEThe compost was considered mature when the texture was uniform and results of a commerciallyavailable test conrmed maturity. hQuality testing of the nal compost product was performed approx- imately 12 months after the carcasses were placed inthe windrows. 3. Results The client charge for composting was comparable toor associated with lower cost than alternative meth-ods (Table 1). To compost an individual horse carcass of 1000- 1200-pound weight, approximately 12-14 cubicyards of bulking material was necessary. Compost-ing the horses in windrows reduced the total amountof bulking material needed per horse by approxi-mately 25-35%. Each windrow of approximately 14 feet in width and 50 feet in length was able to sufciently decom-pose 7-10 average-sized horse carcasses windrows and indi-vidual compost piles attained temperatures in ac-ceptable ranges within 3-4 days of creation of thepile and maintained acceptable temperatures forlonger than the minimum requirement of 3 days (forpathogen destruction). In properly constructed compost piles (Fig. 1), the pile \"yields\" on the third day after the carcass isplaced in the pile; this occurs when the body cavitiesof the carcass collapse, and a visible depression isnoticed at the top of the pile and some crevices mayform (Fig. 4). Piles were reformed to pyramid shape and additional substrate was placed on thepile at that time to ensure a minimum of 24-in.depth coverage of the carcass. At the time of the rst turning (approximately 4-5 mo), all carcasses had decomposed to bone.Some mane and tail hair remained recognizable(Figs. 5 and 6). Properly maintained compost piles do not produce offensive odors or drainage, or attract vermin, in-sects, or predators. On several occasions over thecourse of a year, shallow digging by a fox was ob-served but did not extend deeper than 4-5 inches;this was presumably due to the heat present in thepile during the composting process. Minor evi-dence of worm-harvesting activity by skunks wasapparent, but did not extend beyond 3-4 inches indepth. Qualitatively, the number of flies presentwas similar to or reduced compared with used bed-ding piles observed on local horse farms. On average, windrows were turned a total of ve to six times (Fig. 7) before the compost product wasconsidered mature via testing. Once mature, thecompost was screened to remove large particles andproduce a product suitable for consumer use (Fig. 8). Due primarily to word-of-mouth marketing, the number of horses composted per year increased by Fig. 4. Windrow showing a yielded carcass, with crevices. Fig. 5.

In addition, owners requested composting ofother animals, including pets and other livestockkept on hobby farms as pets (Table 2). Initially,many horse owners reacted negatively to the term\"composting\" but were receptive to the use of theterm \"above-ground burial\" as well as the concept ofreturning the horse to the earth in familiar material(bedding). Horse owners were comforted by the op-portunity to collect some or all of the compost gen-erated from their horse to spread on elds orgardens. The analysis iof the nal compost product con - rmed that the compost was mature, highly stableand presented no risk of ill effect on plants. 4. Discussion Chemically euthanized horses must be disposed ofquickly to prevent poisoning of scavengers, both wildand domestic. 1-3Poisonings of wildlife due to mis - handled euthanized carcasses may result in federaland criminal charges. 1 In-ground burial is often the rst choice of horse owners, likely due to its traditional acceptance fordeceased humans. However, burial is not legal inmany areas; may not be a viable option for those whodo not own the property on which the horse is kept;may not be legal or possible in areas with high water tables; may not be possible due to soil composition orthe presence of bedrock or hardpan; and presentsconcerns regarding soil and ground water contami-nation. 2As concerns about the health of our envi - ronment grow, increasing numbers of towns/municipalities are placing restrictions on groundburial or prohibiting it altogether. In the anaerobicenvironment associated with below-ground burial,the carcass does not decompose at a reliable rate dueto variation in soil components, weather, and otherfactors; there are anecdotal reports of nearly intacthorse carcasses being discovered 10-15 years afterburial. 4Insufcient burial of a euthanized horse two years prior resulted in the fatal poisoning of two dogs.3An additional issue associated with burial for many horse owners is lack of access to appropri- ate equipment. Excavating equipment is not oftenreadily available and can be costly to rent the equip-ment and pay a skilled operator. Cremation is similarly acceptable due to parallels with human methods but may be cost prohibitive,may not be available in some areas due to the lim-ited number of facilities, and is associated with theproduction of greenhouse gases and potential pollut-ants. 5,6In addition, some facilities that accept horses for cremation do not have equipment sized properly to accept intact horse carcasses, and mustsection the carcasses to cremate them; this is notacceptable to many horse owners. Alkaline hydrolysis, also called water cremation or green cremation, utilizes water and sodium hy-droxide or potassium hydroxide to reduce the car-cass to liquid and bone. When used for animalcarcass disposal, the liquid (composed of amino ac-ids, peptides, sugars and soap) can be distributed onelds. The process successfully degrades chemicals(including pharmaceuticals) and kills pathogens. 7,8 The process is more environmentally responsiblecompared with flame cremation. Disposal of an av-erage-sized horse carcass using commercially avail-able alkaline hydrolysis can be performed in 18-20hours. At this time, alkaline hydrolysis is notwidely available. Commercially available units jca- pable of accepting an intact horse carcass cost sev-eral hundred thousand dollars, making them costprohibitive for many areas. Rendering has steadily become less available in many areas due to reductions in the number of com-panies providing the service. 9Rendering is an un - Fig. 7. Appearance of windrow at rst turn.

In addition, chemically eu-thanized animals are undesirable to renderers dueto barbiturate residues that the renderingprocess. 9-11Horse owners and equine practitio - ners have experienced poor and inhumane handlingof horse carcasses by some renderers, including de-capitation of some animals and audible long bonefractures as the horses' bodies are pulled onto atruck using a winch cable tied around their limbs orthroatlatch. One veterinarian was aware of a ren-dering company hired to haul a horse home from areferral center in which the truck operators at-tempted to extort additional payment from thehorse's owners with a threat to dump their horse'scarcass on the side of the road. 12 Not all municipal landlls allow disposal of large animal carcasses, and landll disposal is aestheti-cally displeasing to many horse owners who feeltheir beloved companion is being \"tossed out withthe trash.\" Landlls also present environmentalchallenges as the available space for landllssteadily reduces. 12 Composting provides a means of disposing horse carcasses that is overall superior to alternatives be-cause it is environmentally responsible, cost effec-tive, and produces a useful and benecial endproduct. Unlike burial, properly maintained com-post piles do not present the risk of groundwatercontamination, and the composting surface can bereused numerous times. Unlike cremation, com-posting does not require specialized equipment anddoes not produce greenhouse gases. Composting ispreferable to rendering because composting resultsin adequate destruction of pharmaceuticals such asbarbiturates. Alkaline hydrolysis is comparable tocomposting with regard to environmental effect, butrequires specialized equipment and is not widelyavailable. Composting can be performed onsite (in accor- dance with state regulations, including minimalsetback distances and permit approval where neces-sary) or at designated facilities. Additional bene-ts include the ability to utilize waste bedding,which is often readily available on horse properties;low cost compared with cremation; and the produc-tion of a reusable end product (compost), which pro-vides environmental benet and allows thecomposting area to be reused. The composting pro-cess produces acceptable degradation of barbiturateand nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory residues, reduc-ing environmental risk. 14-21 Composting, particularly when communicated as above-ground burial, is acceptable to horse ownerswho demand that their animals be handled in arespectful manner, even after death. Combiningcomposting, or any means of disposal, with compas-sionate and respectful handling increases its accept- ability to horse owners. An intact horse carcass can be reduced to usable, mature compost in approximately 8-12 months withproper management. Although careful monitoringis important, if done as a commercial endeavor itdoes not require signicant amounts of time and thecomposting business can be maintained as supple-mental to other employment. Analysis of mature compost at 12 months after initial carcass placement conrmed that the com-posting process yielded high-quality compost suit-able for use on elds and gardens. However, composting should only be undertaken by those with a solid understanding of the processinvolved and the proper maintenance of compostpiles to ensure adequate decomposition and produc-tion of a mature, useful end product. Certicationis recommended to ensure that best practices areunderstood and followed. The compost pad must beproperly located and constructed to facilitate appro-priate composting. Depending on local and/or stateregulations, a designated composting facility shouldoperate according to guidelines established in a fa-cility-specic compost management plan approvedby state agricultural authorities, conservation au-thorities, cooperative extension, or other relevantauthorities. State regulations vary, and many states require permits to compost animal carcasses, especiallythose that did not originate from the land on whichthe composting is being performed. Prior to com-posting large animal carcasses, consult your stateregulations or natural resource council. Many horse owners become deeply bonded to their horses, and expect that their animals will be han-dled in a respectful and compassionate manner evenin death. Composting, or above-ground burial, pro-vides an environmentally responsible alternative fordisposal of equine carcasses; combining compostingwith appropriate techniques for moving large ani-mals provides an environmentally responsible dis-posal option that respects the human-animal bond.

With an increased demand fromclients and an increased number of practitioners becoming acupuncture certied, it becomes impor-tant to examine the application and protability of acupuncture in current private practice. Thispaper will examine the cost and benet of practicing acupuncture both as a therapy and as anadjunctive diagnostic tool, as well as to explore how private practices are charging for their ser-vices. Authors' addresses: Peterson and Smith Equine presenting author. \u00a9 2016 AAEP. 1. Introduction Acupuncture is a quickly expanding service offeredin the eld of equine medicine. In principle, acu-puncture is the insertion of needles at specic pointson the body with the intended purpose of changingthe body's physiology. The mechanism by whichthis occurs is unclear but theories include a decreasein inflammation, an increase in circulation, or stim-ulus of opioid receptors resulting in alteration ofneuropathways. 1,2The efcacy of acupuncture has been documented anecdotally and an increasing number of studies in recent years have successfullyfocused on providing quantitative data to support itsuse both as a therapy and as a diagnostic tool. 3 As the Western scientic community continues toexplore the benets of Eastern medicine, horse own-ers are also seeking these therapies for their ani-mals. According to the 2013 American Associationof Equine Practitioners (AAEP) Touch report, 38% ofowners named having a practitioner that is knowl-edgeable about the latest developments and treat-ments in equine medicine in their top three mostimportant attributes in their veterinarian. AAEPTouch research suggests that while 52% of ownerssay it is \"extremely important\" that their veterinar- ian is \"knowledgeable about developmentsand treatments in equine medicine,\" only 35% agreestrongly that their veterinarian can be describedthat way. That 17-percentage-point difference isthe largest gap between importance and perfor-mance among the 20 attributes measured. Fur-ther, 10% of horse owners surveyed had used theservices of a veterinarian other than their primaryveterinarian to perform acupuncture, comparedwith 4% that used their primary veterinarian foracupuncture. 4 As clients express interest and willingness to ex- plore alternative therapies, more and more equinepractitioners are becoming trained and certied to perform acupuncture, chiropractic manipulationand other complementary therapies each year.Currently, acupuncture is not part of the veterinaryschool curriculum but instead must be acquired ascontinuing education, either as a student duringholidays and breaks from school or following thecompletion of veterinary school. As such, becomingcertied in acupuncture is not without cost as prac-titioners must take the time to travel, study, and 578 2016 /H11408Vol. 62 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WORDS OF WISDOM FROM EVERYDAY PRACTICE NOTESpay tuition for certication. The objective of thisresearch was to examine the cost and benet ofpracticing acupuncture both as a therapy and as anadjunctive diagnostic tool, as well as to explore howprivate practices are charging for their services. Solution Certication in veterinary acupuncture is a costlyinvestment. Practitioners desiring to widentheir knowledge base in this matter need to beprepared to charge clients for the application ofnewly developed skill sets. Because clientsstrongly value veterinarians who are up to date onthe latest techniques and developments, chargingfor additional skill sets should be readily accepted.Through appropriate client communication andmarketing of acupuncture services, returning theinvestment of certication should not be a difculttask and will also expand the depth and quality ofpatient care in private practice. 2. Materials and Methods This study was conducted using Qualtrics surveyprogram licensed through the University of Flor-ida. A survey consisting of an informed consentform and twelve questions was distributed to vet-erinarians. The survey collected descriptive dataabout the veterinary practice, information aboutthe practice's use of acupuncture therapy and pric-ing of these services. The nal question was onlydisplayed to the contributor should their previousquestions match dened criteria. There was nocompensation given to contributors. All contrib-uted content was anonymous and all questionswere optional. The survey was distributed through the AAEP General Discussion forum (1388 links sent), theAAEP Business Education Rounds forum (506 linkssent), and the AAEP Complementary & AlternativeMeds Round forum (282 links sent). Additionaldistribution to members of a private alternativetherapy listserv was provided by an acupuncture-certied veterinarian (total distribution unknown). 3. Results Sample Population Sample population questions were posed to respon-dents regarding practice size, client disciplines, andgeographical area of practice (Fig. 1, A-C). Application of Acupuncture Of the 109 respondents, 63 reported to offer acupunc-ture performed by a certied acupuncturist in theirpractice. Of those practices, 61.84% of practitionerswere acupuncture certied. Of practices using acu-puncture, reported use averaged 38.4% therapeuticacupuncture treatments and 43.45% indirect use ofacupuncture in diagnostic evaluations. Among theserespondents, 32% reported that therapeutic acupunc-ture treatments made up less than 10% of their total acupuncture use. Therapeutic Acupuncture Multiple and various modalities of treatments for acu-puncture therapy were reported by respondents (Fig.2). Dry needling was the most common modality(36.9%). The most commonly reported therapy listedin the Other category was laser acupuncture. The most commonly reported time period for a practitioner to spend with a patient on acupuncturetherapy treatments was 45 minutes (44% of respon- Fig. 1.

Thirty-one percent of respondents reportedspending 30 minutes on therapy, 17% spent greaterthan 1 hour, and 8% spent 15 minutes or less.The average time for a practitioner to spend with apatient while administering acupuncture treatmentwas 42 minutes. Seventy-six percent of practitioners who used acu- puncture therapy in their practice reported charging aflat rate for treatments and ve of the 44 respondents(11%) in this category reported to have a variable ordecreased flat rate depending on the established ornew status of the client. Six percent of practitionerscharged an hourly rate and the remaining 18% re-ported variable rates based on the type of therapy,materials, and time spent. The most commonly re-ported flat rate was $100, followed by $150. In thecases that respondents reported a range of flat ratepricing, the average of the range was included in thegure. The weighted average flat-rate charge foracupuncture was found to be $126.17 (Fig. 3). The average overhead cost to the practitioner was reported for each type of acupuncture therapy (Fig.4). The largest overhead cost was associated withaqua-acupuncture, but overhead for all therapieswere less than $20 per treatment. The average overhead cost was $17.33. Diagnostic Acupuncture On average, respondents reported their routine lame-ness examination consisted of 23% diagnostic acu-puncture. The highest number of respondentsreported that diagnostic acupuncture made up 1-10%of their lameness examination (Fig. 5). Forty-one of 59 respondents (69%) reported that they charge the same amount for lameness exami-nations including acupuncture compared with lame-ness exams that do not include acupuncture. Twoof 59 respondents (3%) reported a higher charge forlameness examinations that include acupuncture di-agnostics. These two respondents reported charg-ing $20 and $50 more when acupuncture is includedthan their fee for a lameness examination that doesnot include such diagnostics. Of the respondents who reported charging the same amount for lameness examinations with andwithout acupuncture, 26% indicated that they feltthe time spent using acupuncture for diagnosis didnot validate an upcharge. The remaining 74% in-dicated that either their client expected acupunc-ture to be included in diagnosis or that acupuncture Fig. 2.

Discussion For the data set collected, the average prot marginfor acupuncture treatments as a therapy, as calcu-lated from the average overhead ($17.33) andaverage flat rate ($126.17) is $108.84 per session.Analyzing the gross prot potential with regard tothe average time spent with each patient (42 min),the average net income of practitioners administer-ing acupuncture treatments as therapy is $2.59 perminute ($108.84/42 min), or $155.49/hour. Accord-ing to the 2015 American Veterinary Medical Asso-ciation Report on Veterinary Compensation, themedian professional gross income of equine veteri-narians is $87,000 and the median number of workhours per week is 58. 5This means that equine veterinarians working 50 weeks of the year tally 2900 hours and earn a median gross income perhour of $30.00, nearly a fth of the gross income perhour for acupuncture therapy. This high level ofprot results from the relatively low overhead cost ofacupuncture therapy (reportedly less than $20/treatment). However, it is not certain whether re-spondents included a portion of the xed costs ofrunning their business in this gure, or whether itwas strictly based on the specic costs associatedwith the acupuncture services provided. It is then important to evaluate whether the cost of acupuncture certication will be protable based onthe intended use of acupuncture in practice. Usingthe Chi Institute in Florida as an example, the currentcost of tuition for acupuncture certication rangesfrom $800-$1700 per 4-day class session. 6Three class sessions, two online sessions, and a $350 nal examination are included in the curriculum. Thelisted total price for tuition for the International Vet-erinary Acupuncture Society (IVAS) basic veterinaryacupuncture course is $6495, comparable to the ChiInstitute. 7At a net income of $108.84 per acupunc - ture session, 60 acupuncture sessions are required topay for tuition alone. This tuition does not includetravel, lodging, and time away from the practice.Acupuncture certication is not a negligible expense;however, it is one that could be justied and depreci-ated over time depending on the amount of acupunc-ture therapy intended to be performed. In the population studied, only 38.4% of overall acupuncture practice is spent using acupuncturetreatment as a therapy. Indirect use of acupunc-ture as a diagnostic tool was reported to be morecommon (43.45%) but was less commonly billed tothe client. In the majority of responses, the fee forindirect acupuncture use was reported to be \"part of\"the examination/diagnostics fee. It is not clearwhether this bundling of fees is made known to theclient, or whether the client is aware of the addi-tional use of acupuncture diagnostics during thecourse of the lameness examination. This is a rel-evant point of interest given that 32% of respon-dents reported that acupuncture therapy makes up less than 10% of their acupuncture practice. Be-cause of the apparent lack of billing for indirect useof acupuncture, it is unclear whether acupuncturecertication would be overall protable in this rep-resented average of respondents. The limitations of this study were inherent in the style of data collection used. To generate re-sponses, the survey was kept short and none of thequestions were required, allowing respondents toskip questions should they choose. As such, someof the responses were not able to be interpretedbecause they contained partial or incomplete an-swers. Respondents were asked to answer ques-tions based on estimated percentages in theirpractice and therefore exact quantitative totals forincome and caseload were not gathered. It is alsoworth noting that the data averages used do notaccount for diverse demographic regions withinNorth America and may not be applicable to re-gions that are far above or below the mean. A follow-up study examining client interest in acupuncture diagnostics specically as well as theirawareness of its current use by their veterinariancould add value to this study by revealing clientwillingness to pay fees for additional or augmenteddiagnostics. In addition, evaluation of the poten-tial for acupuncture certication to increase clientsatisfaction and ultimately increase client basewithout increasing the charges for services renderedmay also prove worthwhile.
