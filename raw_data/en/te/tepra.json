It is one of the largest teaching hospitals in the nation. New Facility: Structural damage occurred in several hospital buildings in 1994 as a result of the Northridge Earthquake. Plans for a 600-bed hospital were submitted in 1998. The Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) approved the plans in September 2002 and a contract was awarded in December 2002 for construction of the new facility . Construction began in April 2003 and was completed in November 2008. The patient move to the new hospital took place on November 7, 2008.

In addition, the employee shall be allowed use of other paid or unpaid leave if one-way travel over 500 miles is required. The intent of this Bereavement Leave provision is to allow an eligible employee to be absent from work for a prescribed number of working days, not hours, as specified in applicable Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs). Documentation on the death of the family member and travel distance must be submitted to be eligible for use of this leave. DHS Policy 756.8 provides additional information on this subject. County employees summoned to serve as jurors will be granted jury duty leave. An employee must notify his/her supervisor as soon as he/she receives a jury duty summons and provide the supervisor with a copy of the summons. All employees in a permanent position (full-time or part-time) who are ordered to serve on a jury shall be allowed the \"necessary time to be absent from work\" at his/her regular pay. \"Necessary time to be absent from work\" means the amount of time required to fulfill jury duty service, including travel time. It does not include any time in which the employee is \"on call\" or when his/her presence is not required. Due to extended work days associated with a 9/80 or 4/40 schedule, employees may be required to return to work following release from court. Employees who are not on a permanent position shall receive a maximum of two days (16 hours) of pay in any one year if they have completed at least 200 days of active service in the prior calendar year . Employees who do not meet this requirement shall receive a maximum of one working day (8 hours) with pay per year . The leave is not accumulated. Exceptions to this may be defined in applicable Memoranda of Understanding. Service on any California State (Superior) or Federal Court is covered by Jury Duty Leave. Service on any County' s criminal grand jury is covered, but service on a civil grand jury is not covered, because such service is entirely voluntary . An employee may serve on a County grand jury, if the employee's department approves an unpaid leave of absence, but the employee does not receive his/her regular pay or Jury Duty Leave. Employees serving jury duty on their regular day off (RDO) are on their own time for that day. Jury duty served on a RDO is not work time for overtime or any other purpose. County employees are not eligible for jury duty fees, but do receive their regular earnings while on jury duty . Employees may receive mileage reimbursement, beginning on the second day of service, which does not have to be returned to the County . PROOF OF JURY DUTY SERVICE An employee summoned to jury duty must submit a copy of the jury duty certification form(s) obtained from the court to his/her supervisor AND Payroll Services upon return to work. It is the employee's responsibility to obtain proof of jury service from the court. If proof of jury service is not submitted to the supervisor , the employee may not be granted jury duty leave.JURY DUTY Images by Freepik BENEFITS AND LEAVES (COUNTY EMPLOYEES) 7LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK BENEFITS AND LEAVES (COUNTY EMPLOYEES)FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA) The Department of Health Services (DHS) complies with the provisions of FMLA and designates FMLA leave whenever applicable to any eligible employee (including temporary and part-time employees).

On Election Day, polls are open between 7:00 AM and 8:00 PM. If you are scheduled to be at work during those hours and need to take time off to vote, you may take as much time as you need, but only two hours of that time will be paid. You should also consider taking advantage of the Early Voting or Voting by Mail resources that are available to all Los Angeles County registered voters. Your time off to vote can only be at the beginning or end of your regular work shift, whichever allows the most free time to vote and the least time off from your regular working shift, unless you make another arrangement with your supervisor. You must notify your supervisor at least two working days prior to the election if you need to take time off to vote. Employees who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking may be allowed time off from work to attend to legal issues, obtain medical assistance (physical or mental), safety planning, arrange relocation for him/herself or a child, and/or obtain related services. Such employees shall inform management in a reasonable amount of time in advance, if feasible, of the need to take time off for such reasons and provide appropriate documentation (e.g. police report, court order, medical certification). California law prohibits employers from discharging, threatening to discharge, demoting, suspending, discriminating, or retaliating against an employee who takes a leave of absence or leave of absence to attend legal proceedings resulting from a crime against the employee, asks for leave to obtain assistance, or asks for reasonable accommodations to ensure a safe work environment for the employee, his/her immediate family or registered domestic partner . Any employee who feels that he/she has been discriminated or retaliated against as a result of a leave of absence for these purposes may file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement of the California Department of Industrial Relations.

Disrespectful and disruptive behavior, including workplace bullying, is not accept - able. DHS supervisors and managers are responsible for treating complaints of bullying seriously, whether between co-workers or a supervisor and subordinate; addressing disruptive conduct; and promoting a professional and respectful work environment. What can you do to build a healthy, professional, and safe work environment? Employees throughout DHS can help build a healthy workplace by adopting the following values: Honor DHS' mission and give the public, our patients and your co-workers extraordinary care Be fair to each other, build trust, and support teamwork Strive to resolve conflict and disruptive behavior early on and at the lowest possible level Communicate effectively and respectfully Always display a professional demeanor Acknowledge and respect power dynamics between and among co-workers All workforce members who work in a DHS healthcare facility, including students, volunteers, and non-DHS/non-County workforce members, must have an initial and annual health screening. This includes, but is not limited to, a tuberculin skin test, chest x-ray (if needed), respirator fit test (if needed), medical questionnaire, communicable disease screening, and/or any other medical tests, as indicated. You and your supervisor are responsible to comply with DHS policy, and ensure you obtain a health screening annu - ally as a condition of continued employment/assignment. You may contact the facility Employee Health Services to find out when your health screening is due. You will not be allowed to work inside a County medical facility without appropriate documentation of health clearance or required health evaluation. It is a violation of Joint Commission, Title 22, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) standards for a workforce member to work without appropriate health clearance and will subject the facility to possible accreditation citations. HEALTH AND WELLNESS HEALTH AND WELLNESS RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE HEALTH SCREENING Images by Freepik HEALTH AND WELLNESS 11LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK HEALTH AND WELLNESSSmoking is not permitted inside any DHS building, structure, or vehicle. Additionally, smoking shall not be permitted within 50 feet of main entrances, exits, and operable windows of any occupied building, within 25 feet of an access ramp or disabled path, or a County parking lot, parking structure, or parking garage. Smoking is permitted only in the approved outdoor designated smoking areas, if any. Some DHS facilities have implemented a smoke-free environment. The smoking prohibition includes e-cigarettes (vaping/liquid tobacco) and cannabis/marijuana. All workforce members must report to work free of the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or improperly used prescription drugs. Reporting to work under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, misused prescription drugs, or possessing, manufacturing, or sell - ing illegal drugs while on County time/business will result in appropriate discipline. Workforce members who observe any usage of alcohol, illegal drugs or misuse of prescription drugs must report the incident to their supervisor, facility Human Resources or Performance Management representative, a member of management, and/or the facility police personnel. Body mechanics is utilization of the correct muscles to complete a task safely and efficiently , without undue strain to a joint or muscle. Proper body mechanics can help prevent injuries to you and others while at work. Why You Should Practice Good Body Mechanics To prevent injury to yourself, patients, and others To prevent cumulative trauma disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome To maintain good general health To increase capacity to work comfortably To reduce stress and fatigue while working Maintaining Good Body Mechanics Think of your body as a machine that needs to be maintained in good working order in order to run smoothly and work efficiently. Things that you can do to avoid injury include: Maintain good posture. Avoid bending and lifting with your back. Keep physically fit. Perform regular exercise and maintain flexibility . GUIDELINES FOR DECREASING MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURY General Guidelines for Maintaining Proper Body Mechanics During Activity Plan your actions! Test the load, making sure that you can handle the weight. Get help when necessary. Use proper footwear. Look for properly fitting shoes that are low heeled.You must complete your health screening annually.NOTE SMOKING POLICY SUBSTANCE ABUSE BODY MECHANICS 12LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK HEALTH AND WELLNESSBend your knees and hips to get close to the load. Use the muscles of your legs to lift. DO NOT use your back to lift! If wearing a lab coat, minimize items carried in your pockets and distribute the load evenly between the pockets to minimize strain on the neck and shoulders. Wear clothing that allows your body to move. Reaching Avoid stretching out with your arms to reach for items. This straightens out the natural curves in your spine and puts you at risk for injury. Reach only as high as is comfortable for you. Use a ladder or step to bring yourself closer to the object prior to grabbing it. Test the weight of the load prior to pulling it down. DO NOT stand on rolling chairs or stools to reach for items! Store commonly used items on shelves that are at heights easily accessible to you. Twisting/Turning Turn with your feet, not your back. This means that you should move with your hips and shoulders together when moving and turn your entire body. Position frequently used items in front of you, so you can easily access them without turning or twisting. Do not keep your feet fixed when turning. They need to move with you! Standing When standing, keep your knees slightly bent to take pressure of f your lower back. If standing for longer periods of time, rest one foot up on a low step, shelf or stool (non-wheeled). Patient Transfers Before transferring a patient, make sure the brakes are locked on wheeled equipment. Never let the patient put their arms around your neck. Transfer/gait belt is recommended if patient requires assistance. Allow the patient adequate time to assist with the transfer, if able. Often times, the patient may be able to do the transfer with minimal assistance, instead of the workforce member doing a total patient lift. Use a lift or transfer device to move dependent patients. Get extra staff to assist, if the patient is too heavy or difficult for one person to transfer. Equipment/Object Transfer Get a firm footing prior to lifting. Bend your knees and hips to get close to the load. Use the muscles of your legs to lift. DO NOT use your back to lift! Keep the object close to your body when lifting and moving it. Keep your back as upright as possible and hold your stomach muscles tight when lifting/moving the object. Try to use wheeled carts to move bulky, larger or heavier objects further than a few feet. Bring wheeled carts to the area you are working in, instead of carrying the item to the cart, i.e., carrying linen to the linen cart. If the item is too heavy for one person to handle, get help! MarineInsight 13LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK HEALTH AND WELLNESSYou must immediately report any work-related injury, accident, or illness to your supervisor or the supervisor's designee. Even if you decline medical treatment, you are still required to report the incident. Failure to report an injury , accident, or illness may result in denial of benefits. The Department of Health Services shall maintain a healthy work environment and comply with various regulations/ mandates applicable to workplace safety. As part of our workplace safety efforts, the IIPP is designed to: Prevent the pain, suffering, and loss that workforce members and their families experience due to work-related injuries or illnesses. Enhance productivity by reducing lost time caused by work-related injuries or illnesses. Comply with California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 3203. Conduct periodic inspections to identify unsafe conditions and work practices. Investigate occupational injury or occupational illness. Correct unsafe or unhealthy conditions in a timely manner based on the severity of the hazard. Provide safety training and instruction to all workforce members. The Musculoskeletal Injury Prevention Plan (MIPP), an adjunct to the IIPP , describes the elements of the Hospital's Safe Patient Handling Program and is available upon request from the Safety Office. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a program that provides assessment, grief counseling, and referral services to County employees and their families from professional mental health counselors. The program's goal is to help employees and/or their family members who are experiencing emotional, substance-related, situational, or relationship problems that are creating distress and posing difficulties in their daily lives. There is no charge to see an EAP counselor. However, if the counselor recommends specialized or more extensive services through another source, such as the employee's health plan, the employee assumes responsibility for any co-payments or fees associated with those services. To schedule an appointment, call during regular office hours (see Quick Reference for details). The first appointment may be on County time with the permission of the employee's supervisor. Subsequent EAP appointments, if any, will require usage of employee's own time. The employee will need to advise their supervisor and request time off as with any other time-off requests, if appointment(s) are during work hours. The purpose of the Rideshare Program is to reduce traffic congestion and pollution resulting from air emissions from vehicles used to commute between home and work. It is also required per County agreement with the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). Sites required to participate in the County's Rideshare Program have an assigned Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC) responsible for promoting Rideshare, facility-specific benefits and incentives available to employees that participate in a Rideshare mode as well as conducting the annual Rideshare survey.REPORTING WORK RELATED INJURIES/ILLNESSES INJURY AND ILLNESS PREVENTION PROGRAM (IIPP) EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (COUNTY EMPLOYEES) VEHICLE TRIP REDUCTION - RIDESHARING Freepik 14LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK HEALTH AND WELLNESSTAKE PRIDE, SHARE THE RIDE!

COMMUTER BENEFIT PLANSave money by enrolling in the County's Commuter Benefit Program. Elect to purchase your bus, train, or vanpool fare using pre-tax dollars. This lowers your taxable income, resulting in annual tax savings. VEHICLE PURCHASING SERVICES PROGRAMThe County has arranged for employees to receive a discount on the purchase of a \"green\" vehicle from various car dealerships. Many sites have charging stations to accommodate electric vehicles. Refer to the County's Rideshare Website for more information. TELEWORKWant to work at home? If your work assignment allows it and it is approved by your supervisor, you can work at home and leave the commute behind. Telework is a management option; you and your supervisor must attend training and sign an agreement. GUARANTEED RIDE HOME (GRH)Afraid you won't be able to get home in an emergency? Employees that Rideshare are eligible for a \"guaranteed ride home\" in emergency situations (unexpected overtime, personal illness/ family emergency) up to 4 times a year. ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULES (COMPRESSED WORK WEEK) Working a 4/40 or 9/80 work schedule can reduce traffic and air pollution. Discuss this management option with your immediate supervisor or manager .

DHS uses eHR web-based timesheets (TIMEI) for documenting and recording time worked and time of f. Time recorded as worked must only reflect time that is actually spent performing work for the County. Employees may not spend time working on non-County or non-DHS related activities during County working hours. Such activities may not be reflected as County time on the employee's time collection document/timesheets.

An official work week is defined as five days of work per week for a total of 40 hours. A normal workday consists of eight (8) consecutive hours exclusive of at least a 30-minute lunch period and inclusive of two (2) fifteen (15) minute rest periods to be taken as determined by management in accordance with Los Angeles County Code provisions and applicable MOU. A rest period should be taken approximately midmorning and midafternoon, they shall not be accumulated or combined to lengthen the lunch period, shorten the workday or to make up tardiness or absences. Alternate work schedules (9/80, 4/40) may be available and approved at the discretion of management. All workforce members are expected to conduct themselves in a courteous, cooperative and professional manner at all times. Disruptive, inappropriate, or unprofessional conduct by any workforce member toward another workforce member , the public, or patients is unacceptable. Disruptive conduct may include behavior that interferes with teamwork or safe patient care, or when the behavior has the ef fect of intimidating or suppressing legitimate input by other workforce members. Disruptive behavior can be obvious, like angry verbal outbursts, throwing objects, or disrespectful language. It can also be passive or less obvious such as failing to engage in necessary work communication or not performing assigned tasks. Workforce members should report disruptive, inappropriate or unprofessional behavior. Some inappropriate or unprofessional behavior will need to be reported to the appropriate professional credential issuing agency/board. There will be no retaliation against anyone who reports a violation of this policy in good faith. However , any workforce member who deliberately makes a false accusation will be subject to appropriate corrective action. Moreover , reporting a violation does not protect individuals from appropriate corrective action regarding their own misconduct. Corrective action will be commensurate with the nature and severity of the disruptive behavior . It is the responsibility of every County and Non-County employee to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with federal and state laws, and County policies. Federal and state laws, the Los Angeles County Code, and policies of the County and its departments prohibit conduct by County employees in the workplace that is considered unlawful discrimination, including creation of a hostile work environment based on race, color, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, sexual harassment, socioeconomic status, and retaliation. This is a reminder that conduct that violates these laws or County policies could subject an employee to personal liability for damages in court proceedings and/or disciplinary action by the County .WORKFORCE BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 20LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK21 EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCTThe purpose of the County Policy of Equity is to preserve the dignity and professionalism of the workplace as well as to protect the right of employees to be free from discrimination, sexual harassment, unlawful harassment (other than sexual), retaliation and inappropriate conduct toward others based on a protected status. Any such conduct is contrary to the values of the County and a violation of the Policy of Equity. Such conduct may also be illegal under local, county, state, and federal law. The County will not tolerate unlawful discrimination on the basis of age (40 and over); ancestry; color; ethnicity; religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices); denial of family and medical care leave; disability (including mental and physical disability); marital status; medical condition (cancer and genetic characteristics); genetic information; military and veteran status; national origin (including language use restrictions); race; sex (including pregnancy , childbirth, breastfeeding, and medical related to pregnancy, breastfeeding); gender; gender identity; gender expression; sexual orientation; and any other characteristic protected by state or federal law. Further, the County will not tolerate retaliation for filing a complaint under the Policy or similar state or federal law, for participating in an administrative investigation or proceeding under the Policy, for performing duties under the Policy, or for otherwise opposing conduct prohibited by the Policy. As a preventive measure, the County also will not tolerate inappropriate conduct toward others based on a protected status, even if the conduct does not meet the legal definition of discrimination or unlawful harassment. All County employees are responsible for conducting themselves in accordance with this Policy and its associated Procedures. V iolation of the Policy and/or Procedures will lead to prompt and appropriate administrative action including, but not limited to, counseling, training, written warning, written reprimand, suspension, demotion, or discharge. The law prohibits coworkers, supervisors and managers, and third parties from engaging in conduct prohibited by the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). All County employees are required to conduct themselves in accordance with this Policy , and all applicable local, county, state, and federal laws. PREVENTING AND REPORTING HARASSMENT OR INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR It is the responsibility of all workforce members to ensure discrimination, sexual harassment, retaliation, harassment (other than sexual), third person harassment, and inappropriate conduct toward others does not occur in the workplace. Any workforce member who believes he or she has been the object of, has witnessed, or has been affected by inappropriate behavior shall report the action or incident to his or her manager/supervisor, hospital or Comprehensive Health Care Center Chief Executive Officer, facility Human Resources office, or the County Equity Oversight Panel. PROHIBITED CONDUCT Each County employee is responsible for understanding and abiding by the following definitions of prohibited conduct as they may impact any administrative process/proceeding for potential violations of this policy and/or associated procedures. Discrimination Discrimination is the disparate or adverse treatment of an individual based on or because of one or more of the protected classes listed above. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature which meets any one of the following criteria: Submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly , a term or condition of an individual's employment; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions af fecting such individual; or Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the individual's employment or creating an intimidating, hostile, offensive, or abusive working environment.COUNTY POLICY OF EQUITY (CPOE)/SEXUAL HARASSMENT/GENDER NON-DISCRIMINATION 21LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK22 EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCTUnlawful Harassment (Other than Sexual) Unlawful harassment of an individual because of one or more of the protected classes above is also discrimination and prohibited. Unlawful harassment is conduct which has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, offensive, or abusive work environment. Third-Person Harassment Third-person unlawful harassment is indirect harassment of a bystander , even if the person engaging in the conduct is unaware of the presence of the bystander. When an individual engages in harassing behavior, they assume the risk that someone may pass by or otherwise witness the behavior; the County considers this to be the same as directing the harassment towards that individual. Inappropriate Conduct Towards Others Inappropriate conduct toward others is any physical, verbal, or visual conduct based on or because of one or more of the protected classes listed above when such conduct reasonably would be considered inappropriate for the workplace. This provision is intended to stop inappropriate conduct based on a protected status before it becomes discrimination or unlawful harassment. As such, the conduct need not meet the legally actionable state and/or federal standards of severe or pervasive to violate this Policy . An isolated derogatory comment, joke, racial slur, sexual innuendo, etc., may constitute conduct that violates this policy and is grounds for discipline, up to and including discharge from County service. Similarly , the conduct need not be unwelcome to the party against whom it is directed; if the conduct reasonably would be considered inappropriate by the County for the workplace, it may violate this Policy. GENDER IDENTITY AND GENDER EXPRESSION NONDISCRIMINATION Existing anti-discrimination laws such as the Fair Employment and Housing Act and the Unruh Civil Rights Act prohibit discrimination based on certain protected characteristics. Under AB 887 (Atkins), Chapter 719, Statutes of 2011, gender, gender identity and gender expression are added as protected characteristics. Gender expression can mean gender-related appearance and behavior. AB 887 grants workforce members the right to appear or dress consistently with their gender identity and gender expression in the workplace. REPORTING VIOLATIONS OF THIS POLICY Any County employee who believes to have been subjected to conduct that potentially violates this Policy is strongly encouraged to report the matter to a supervisor or manager, whether the employee is or not directly supervised by that person, or to the County Intake Specialist Unit (CISU). The CISU may be reached by phone: 1-855-999-CEOP (2367) or via its website: https://ceop.lacounty.gov/ and is located at: Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration, 500 West Temple Street, Room # B-26, Los Angeles, CA 90012. Any County employee who believes they have been subjected to conduct that potentially violates this Policy has the right to, without undue obstruction or interference, report the potential violation to a supervisor or manager other than their direct supervisor. Any non-supervisory County employee who has knowledge of conduct that potentially violates this Policy is also strongly encouraged to report the matter. County employees may also contact the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) by calling (800) 884-1684 or via their website at www.dfeh.ca.gov and/or may contact the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) by calling (213) 894-1000 or (800) 669-4000 or via their website at www.eeoc.gov . 22LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK23Nepotism is a practice where one workforce member uses their personal influence or power to aid or hinder another in employment, securing employment, promotion or other benefits because of a personal relationship. A workforce member may not supervise an immediate relative or individual who has a personal relationship with the supervisor , either as an immediate supervisor or as a higher-level supervisor. Workforce members are responsible for informing the Department about any person who is an immediate relative or a person in which the workforce member has a personal relationship that is employed by the County and assigned to DHS whether the person is an employee or a contract staff. Immediate relative includes any relationship formed by blood, genealogy , marriage, adoption, cohabitation, and domestic partnership as defined in California Family Code Section 297 et seq. and Los Angeles County Code Section 2.210, including but not limited to spouse (common law or otherwise), child, mother, father, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, grandparent, niece, nephew, step-parent, step-child, step-sibling, cousin or legal guardian. Personal relationships include, but are not limited to, those by virtue of blood, marriage, adoption, cohabitation, or any such other relationship which would give rise to a substantial appearance of impropriety or lack of reasonable objectiveness if the person were to be supervised as set forth in this policy. DHS seeks to provide high-quality patient care in an environment that protects all members of our service delivery team and respects their cultural values, ethics, and religious beliefs. Leadership recognizes that situations may occasionally arise in which your cultural, ethical, or religious beliefs conflict with the rendering of patient care. Speak with your supervisor to submit a request for considerations to be excused from that aspect of patient care. Non-County workforce members should contact the facility contract administrator for terms and conditions of their contract. Patients have the right to be free from mental, physical, sexual, and verbal abuse, neglect, harassment, exploitation and the reporting thereof without fear of retaliation. Sexual contact between a health care worker and a patient is strictly prohibited, is unprofessional conduct, and will constitute sexual misconduct and/or abuse. Examples of inappropriate sexual conduct include, but are not limited to, intercourse, touching the patient's body with sexual intent, inappropriately watching the patient undress/dress, making inappropriate comments, and conducting physical exams not needed or not within the scope of the treatment or complaint. Physicians and health care providers shall avoid any situation that may be construed as sexual misconduct. Unwanted or nonconsensual sexual conduct (with or without force) involving a patient and health care worker , another patient, contract staff, unknown perpetrator, or spouse/significant other, while being treated or occurring on the premises of a DHS facility may constitute a criminal act punishable by law. Each patient, his/her family member, or legal representative has the right to file a complaint or grievance, without fear of retaliation, with the patient advocate, patient relations, or other designated section of the hospital, and to have timely review and notification. Any workforce member who witnesses or reasonably suspects a patient was or is being subjected to inappropriate sexual conduct and/or sexual abuse shall report it to his/her supervisor and to the facility Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The Department is prohibited from taking disciplinary action against a workforce member for making a good faith report.NEPOTISM STAFF RIGHTS IN PATIENT CARE ABUSE PREVENTION, SEXUAL ABUSE, SEXUAL COERCION (INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR TOWARD A PATIENT) EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 23LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK24IMPLICIT BIAS What is Implicit Bias? Implicit bias is defined as having an unconscious, hidden, or unknown preference. Implicit biases unconsciously af fect our atti - tudes, decisions, and actions. Biases may be based on characteristics such as race, gender , or income. How does Implicit Bias Impact Healthcare? Implicit bias is not unique to healthcare. However, in healthcare, implicit biases may affect the way we interact with patients and provide care, even if we are not consciously aware of them. Every patient entering our facilities deserves the same level of care, no matter their appearance, race, age, gender, economic/social status, or other characteristics. Unconscious beliefs and assump - tions can affect medical decisions and negatively affect an already vulnerable patient population. Examples of implicit bias in healthcare include the following: Disparities in pain management; patients of color are less likely to be prescribed pain medication. Patients of color are less likely to receive cardiovascular interventions. Higher mortality rate for black women after being diagnosed with breast cancer . Lack of empathy toward minority patients. Some actions you can take to help prevent implicit bias are: Exploring and confronting your own biases. Acknowledging the importance of implicit bias and its effect on healthcare. Recognizing which interactions with patients are based on stereotypes and reflecting on your response. W ork to change simi - lar future responses. Having a basic understanding of the cultures of the patients we serve. Practicing \"evidence-based medicine\". Embracing diversity and inclusion. All workforce members are required to take the Implicit Bias and Cultural Competency training on the Learning Link.

Newborn babies may also be safely surrendered at hospitals with emergency rooms and fire stations designated by the County Board of Supervisors. For a list of Los Angeles County's Safely Sur - rendered Baby Sites visit https://lacounty.gov/residents/family-services/child-safety/safe-surrender/. Child Protective Services must be notified as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours. Every patient has a right to privacy. To earn our patient's trust, we must protect their health information otherwise they will not want to be our patients. All requests for a patient's health information, or Protected Health Information (PHI) from patients, law enforce - ment or any other entity must be referred to the facility Health Information Management (HIM) department. WHY DO WE NEED TO PROTECT PATIENT INFORMATION? It is the right thing to do. Federal laws, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, and California laws require us to protect the privacy and security of all patient health information. These laws: Require DHS to make a report when a patient's health information kept on a computer/electronic device is not coded in a way to prevent access and is misused or wrongly released. Give patients more rights and increase fines for violating the law . Protect all forms of patient health information, including paper , electronic, verbal, video, photos, etc. Require DHS to take additional steps to keep patient information safe, such as providing additional privacy & security training for workforce members to stay up to date with the vast amount of information and policies. WHAT IS PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION AND PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION? Under HIPAA, a patient's health information is called Protected Health Information (PHI) . PHI is any health information created, used, stored, or transmitted by DHS that could be used to describe the health and identity of a patient. Other laws also require the protection of Personal Identity Information (PII) which is electronic information that can be used to trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. SAFE HAVEN/SAFELY SURRENDERED BABY LAW Unsplash PRIVACY OF PATIENT INFORMATION (HIPAA) Protected Health Information (PHI) Demographic information, e.g., name, address, phone number, email address Physical or health condition of a patient, e.g., diagnosis, condition, medications Services or treatment provided, e.g., care plan, treatment records, progress notes Payment information, e.g., medical record number, health insurance numbers, account number, credit card number, social security number, date of birth, date of death, dates of service Other information about past, current and future medical/health care, e.g., photographs EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 25LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK26PII and PHI share some similarities under the law but are governed by distinctively dif ferent regulatory bodies. The best practice is to protect all information associated with a patient and follow the Department' s policies related to patient privacy. PRIVACY LAWS GIVE PATIENTS CERTAIN RIGHTS Along with a patient's right to privacy, laws give patients other rights. This includes how we can use their information and to whom we can disclose it. Under HIPAA, DHS staff are required to provide patients with a Notice of Privacy Practices, usually during their first encounter or visit with us or anytime they request a copy. Under the Notice of Privacy Practices, patients have the right to: Access, inspect, and request copies of most of their PHI, except information the healthcare provider feels might be harmful to them. Ask us to send their health information to someone. Restrict who we can disclose their information, including verbally . Ask us to send their mail or call them at an alternative address or telephone number . Request corrections or changes to their medical record if they feel there is an error. Get a list of people or places where we sent their health information. File a complaint. All requests for PHI from patients, law enforcement or any other entities must be referred to the facility Health Information Man - agement (HIM) department for processing. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PATIENT INFORMATION The patient's written permission is usually needed for us to disclose their health information to someone or an organization/ agency. The patient's permission is not needed if the use or disclosure is for treatment (may include continuum of care), payment, healthcare operations; or as required by law, e.g., to certain agencies that protect the public. The ORCHID Amwell module is the only authorized platform for direct-to-patient/virtual healthcare visits. Microsoft (MS) Teams should only be used by DHS staff for educational rounds, clinician-to-clinician conversations, or staff meetings. A signed General Consent (Conditions of Admission) allows pictures or video of patients to be taken (only for clinical or medi - cal reasons). The MS Teams application has replaced HIPAABridge and is the only DHS approved platform to be used for photos and vid - eos to ensure secure internal staff communications. Be sure to delete the picture from MS Teams as soon as the picture or video has been uploaded onto the electronic medical record or no longer needed. Pictures should not be stored indefinitely on a cellular device, OneDrive, Teams, or Home drive. The official storage for any document pertaining a patient is the electronic health record system. MS Teams may also be used for discussions regarding treatment between healthcare providers, including instant messaging. A separate written authorization signed by the patient is required if taking pictures or video of the patient for any reason not covered by the General Consent, such as research, education, publications, or news media. The authorization must describe the purpose and use of the pictures or video and list any restrictions the patient or their legal representative has placed on its use. The authorization is only good for that use. Another authorization will be needed to use the pictures or video for some - thing else.Personally Identifiable Information (PII) PII includes an individual's first name or initial, and last name, in combination with any one or more of the following: Social Security number (SSN). Driver's license number or Card number. account number, credit card number, or debit card number in combination with any required security code, access code, or password such as expiration date or mother's maiden name that could permit access to an individual's financial account. Medical information (any information regarding an individual's medical history, mental or physical condition, or medical treatment or diagnosis by a health care professional). Health insurance information (an individual's health insurance policy number or subscriber identification number, any unique identifier used by a health insurer to identify the individual, or any information in an individual' s application and claims history, including any appeals records). EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 26LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK27PROTECTING PATIENT INFORMATION SAFEGUARDS Each member of our workforce is required to take steps to protect the privacy and confidentiality of our patients' PHI. You must have a legal or business \"need-to-know\" to access PHI. Your job duties determine how much patient information you can view or access, not your relationship to the patient. Your supervisor will arrange for you to obtain access to systems and networks necessary for you to do your job. It is a violation of HIPAA and State law to access or look at a patient's electronic medical record(s) without a business need and will be investigated. To protect our patients' privacy, patient access audits are conducted to detect unauthorized access to electronic medical re - cords. Take the time to verify the identity of a patient by using at least two patient identifiers, before providing them with documents and/or medications. Make sure all pages of documents such as discharge summaries, clinic summaries, and medications belong to the patient. Pages can get mixed up from shared printers. Patient information is often inputted/uploaded into the electronic medical record, therefore it' s important to ensure the informa - tion and documents pertain to the correct patient. We must take reasonable safeguards or steps to make sure patient health information is kept private. INCIDENTAL DISCLOSURES Activities we do for business reasons, such as calling out a patient' s name in the waiting area or talking to a patient on the phone or in an area where others might hear are called incidental disclosures. Incidental disclosures do not violate laws if we take sufficient steps to protect the patient' s privacy, such as closing exam room doors or privacy curtains, eliminating use of patient name while talking on phone, or using lowered voices to minimize the risk of others hearing the conversation. DISCLOSING INFORMATION TO SPOUSES, FAMILY MEMBERS, AND FRIENDS Workforce members should use good professional judgment when disclosing health information to a patient in front of a spouse, family members or friends. It is best practice to ASK the patient before disclosing (e.g., a sensitive diagnosis that the patient may wish to keep private from the family member that came with them to their appointment). You should verify the identity of any caller (i.e. family member, spouse, etc.) requesting information about a patient. If possible, ask the patient if you can provide information about them to the caller . You can disclose the patient's information if the patient says it is okay or when asked, does not object, or if the person is the patient's legal representative. You should only talk about current relevant information. DISCLOSING INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA It is against the law to sell patient information to the media. Call the facility Public Information Officer or the facility Privacy Manager immediately if the press or news media requests information about one of our patients. DISCLOSING INFORMATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT Although HIPAA allows disclosures of PHI to law enforcement, state law is more restrictive and must be followed. Generally, a court order or subpoena is required. However, there are exceptions, and you should contact your supervisor or facility Privacy Manager before sharing information about a patient with law enforcement. SOCIAL MEDIA Do not post photos or information about patients or work-related issues on social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Tumblr, Reddit, WhatsApp, etc. It does not matter if you are not using County equipment, if you are at home, or on your break. Due to the nature and type of work you do, just small bits of information put together can reveal identifying information about patients and cause you to violate privacy laws (e.g., a public snapchat post of the hospital, the patient' s condition and details about what happened to them can be seen by the patient's family member). Please keep the workplace professional. Do not take selfies or pictures where a patient or patient document(s) can be visible. EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 27LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK28INAPPROPRIATE ACCESS TO OR DISCLOSURE OF PHI If you acquire, view, or access patient information that you do not need to do your job or give patient information to someone who should not receive it (e.g., friend, family member or person of the general public), you will violate DHS policies, HIP AA, and/or state law. MINIMUM NECESSARY \"Minimum necessary\" means you must only access the information you need to do your job. Just because you have access to a system, network or patient records, does not mean you have the right to access or view confidential or patient information that you do not need to do your job. Only give out just enough information for someone else to do their job. If you are not assigned to the patient's care team or have a work-related justification to access a patient's medical record, you will be in violation of State and/or federal laws and regulations. It is a violation of the law to view confidential or patient information out of curiosity or \"just because you want to know ,\" even if you do not disclose the information to others. The mere fact that it was viewed may result in corrective or disciplinary actions. This includes famous people, close friends, neighbors, coworkers, and family members. You may also be held personally liable by the regulatory agencies or if a lawsuit is filed related to the impermissible access. All patient information is confidential and must always be protected. If you have been a DHS patient, you are not allowed to access your own patient information but may request access or copies of your medical record through the facility HIM. REPORTING POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS AND INCIDENTS Do not hesitate to report suspicious behavior. It's important to remember that malicious activity may affect the entire organiza - tion or our patients' privacy. Timely reporting is the best way to combat threats and reduce risk. You must report anything a workforce member does that might be against DHS Policy, or federal or state laws. If a workforce member peeks at a patient's medical record we must report it even if the workforce member did not tell anyone, or the patient was not harmed. It is still considered a violation. You will not be retaliated against for reporting a suspected or actual violation in good faith. You may stay anonymous. If you choose to report anonymously, you should provide as much detail about the potential violation as possible. Otherwise, it may be difficult for the department to conduct a thorough investigation. If you falsely accuse someone on purpose, you will be subject to discipline. If you report a potential violation in which you were involved, you will still be subject to discipline. You MUST report incidents or potential violations of patient information to your supervisor, the facility Privacy Manager or the DHS Privacy Officer and submit a Safety Intelligence (SI) Event report as soon as possible. Other methods of reporting potential violations are to the following hotlines: DHS Compliance Hotline at 1-800-711-5366 County Fraud Hotline at 1-800-544-6861 Report potential security incidents involving electronic data, suspicious computing activities, or identification of malware to the Enterprise Help Desk (EHD) via email at: Helpdesk@dhs.lacounty.gov or at (323) 409-8000. Report potential phishing emails using the Report Phishing Button \" \" (RPB or PAB) located on your email banner. Never click on the link or open suspicious attachments. FINES AND PENALTIES Use good judgment when working with patient information. Violations may not only result in discipline but can result in fines against the DHS facility involved. If guilty of a violation, you may also be fined and sentenced to prison. Anyone with a professional credential may also be reported to the issuing board or agency for investigation. EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 28LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK29The HIPAA Security Rule covers all electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) when stored on computers and while being sent from computer to computer. ePHI is patient health information that is either accessed, stored or transmitted through com - puters, via an electronic media, or across remote servers. Each DHS facility must take reasonable steps to make sure ePHI is complete, protected, and available when someone needs it. Examples of electronic media include: Computer networks, desktops, laptops and handheld computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and handheld digital equipment such as cameras, tablets (iPads, Androids, eReaders, etc.), and cellular telephones. Computer software and databases. Compact discs (CDs), digital versatile discs (DVDs), diskettes, USB storage devices such as flash/thumb drives, micro storage media, magnetic tapes, and any other means of storing electronic data. Data stored onto these medias should be adequately secured so that any unauthorized access with be prevented. Never store files with sensitive content onto any non- DHS computer or cloud server. Even a small incident is enough to wipe out important data from your laptop' s hard drive or your flash drive. You should always store your important files in a location where your organization can regularly back them up. Always maintain at least one copy of the data stored on your portable devices on a network storage drive or DHS OneDrive cloud storage. Privacy and security policies are posted on the DHS SharePoint intranet (361.1 - 361.30 and 935.00 - 935.20). You should review and familiarize yourself with these policies and those of your facility/unit, so you fully understand your role in the protection of patient health information as it pertains to your job responsibilities. PRIMARY WAYS PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY IS MOST OFTEN VIOLATED BY WORKFORCE MEMBERS: Accessing medical information about a family member, friend, coworker, or high-profile patient without a work-related justifica - tion. Not locking or logging off the computer when stepping away. Everything done under your credentials is your responsibility. Speaking with a patient about his/her illness in front of a family member without giving the patient a chance to agree or object. Lost or stolen unencrypted flash/thumb drive, laptop, or other portable device containing patient information (i.e., leaving your laptop in your vehicle leaves it at risk of getting stolen). Removing PHI from the facility and not properly securing it in a safe place. This increases the risk of inappropriate disclosure and even worse, loss or theft (e.g., taking documents with PHI home and leaving them in your car which gets vandalized). Working remotely in an unsecure work location or not locking your computer when stepping away. Storing documents containing confidential or patient information on a personally owned device. SECURITY INCIDENTS AND POTENTIAL PRIVACY BREACHES CAUSED BY SOCIAL ENGI - NEERING SECURITY OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION County equipment is for County business purposes only.REMEMBER A more recent threat making headlines is Social Engineering. Unlike computer hacking, in which a cybercriminal uses their computer to break into other computers and steal their data, social engineer - ing uses a person's willingness to help, vulnerabilities, sense of urgency, and fears against them to gain access to important personal information. The activities are designed to get you to willingly give up your personal information, mostly for their financial gain, or identity theft, etc. These social engi - neering attacks go by some interesting names: phishing, smishing, and vishing. EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK30PHISHING Phishing is the most common method used by cybercriminals to gain access to information contained in emails, including internal email contacts, computers and servers. Cybercriminals send familiar looking e-mails pretending to be a workforce member , char - itable organization, healthcare program or agency, or e-mail provider, asking you to click on a link to a fake website or document, download a malicious attachment, or reply to a fake request with your User name and password; sometimes making threats if you do not comply. If in doubt, report the email via the \" \" button or contact the DHS Enterprise Helpdesk via email Helpdesk@dhs.lacounty.gov or at (323) 409-8000 so that one of their experts can validate its legitimacy for you. Some telltale signs of a potential phishing or malicious email: Does the tone of the email typically represent the sender? Be extra cautious if the email style is not the way the sender gener - ally communicates with you. Beware of emails that are unexpected or where the content does not appear to directly apply to you. Are there any grammar, spelling errors or typos? Emails from legitimate sources should be free of grammar and spelling errors. Are there any threats or a sense of urgency to the email? Emails that threaten negative consequences or demand immediate action should be treated with suspicion. Does the email direct you to a link or direct you to input your credentials in order to open an attachment? Beware of unex - pected emails, especially if they contain links and/or attachments. Most legitimate companies do not ask for personal informa - tion through e-mail. Verify sender(s) email addresses, domains, or links are from a reliable source. Look for spelling discrepancies and verify links. Hover your cursor over the sender's email address and the link to see the actual web address, but DO NOT click on it. Ensure the links match. For example, if the email is allegedly from PayPal, but the domain of the link does not include \"paypal.com\", it's likely phishing. If the domain names don't match, don't click. Be especially suspicious of any Microsoft Office email attachment that advises you to enable macros to view its content. Un - less you are sure it is a genuine email from a trusted source, do not enable macros and instead immediately delete the email. Scenario: An employee from a County department falls victim to a phishing attack. The cybercriminal sends an email that appears to be from the phished employee and includes a malicious attachment to everyone in the employee' s contacts. If just one DHS employ - ee falls victim to the scheme, the cybercriminal can continue sending emails to the DHS employee' s contacts and obtain copies of the emails and any attachments that may contain patient, employee and/or confidential data. The following ten-step examination process can help identify a possible phishing email: 1. External Tag : If you receive an email from someone that appears to be a colleague or a Departmental Executive, and the email is tagged with the yellow banneryellow banner indicating the email was generated outside of the County, beware! This MAY be a phishing attempt. Look for additional suspicious signs. 2. \"From\" Line : Check the spelling of the sender's email address and verify the email address by hovering your mouse/pointer over it; misspelling is likely an indicator of a spoofed email. 3. \"To\" Line : Check to see if you know other people in the \"to\" line. 4. Hyperlink : Avoid clicking the hyperlink if the URL does not match the text. Hover your mouse/pointer over a hyperlink to see the destination URL before you click on it. 5. Time : Consider the time you receive the email and compare it with the normal time you receive similar emails. Emails sent in the middle of the night might be phishing. 6. Attachments : Avoid opening attachments you are not expecting. EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 30LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK317. Subject : Phishing attempts often use scare tactics to prompt immediate actions, such as \"Change password immediately\". Validate the source before you take any action. 8. Content : Check grammar and spelling; if they are incorrect, confirm the legitimacy of the message before clicking on the links or downloading any files. 9. Trust : Check if the source appears to be a known and trusted individual. 10. If the email seems suspicious, report it through the PAB button. If the email is SPAM , you may block the sender's email address to avoid future junk-emails. Right-click a message from the sender you want to block, and then click Junk > Block Sender . Ransomware typically infects a system through a phishing email containing a malicious email attachment, an infected software download, and/or visiting a malicious website or link. Once ransomware infects a system, it locks it down and the user 's files are encrypted, or the user is restricted from accessing the computer 's key features. The ransomware will send pop-up windows de - manding the user to pay a specific ransom to reclaim or reactivate the computer . If you are not sure about the email's legitimacy, verify with the sender by other means of communication, such as a phone call. If in doubt, report the email via the button or contact DHS Enterprise Help Desk via email Helpdesk@dhs.lacounty.gov or at (323) 409-8000 so that one of their experts can validate its legitimacy for you. Please do not seek other colleagues' opinions by forwarding the email. Doing so will help the threat actor to distribute the malware to a larger audience making it much more difficult to contain. Smishing and vishing are other types of social engineering. Similar to phishing, smishing uses text messages on mobile devices. Some examples are: chances to win a gift card from a major retailer by entering some personal information; signing up to be part of a product test group; a text indicating some form of credit card transaction and a link to confirm. DO NOT CLICK the link; and make sure to delete the text. Vishing (voice phishing) can include a person claiming to be from a legitimate company, like a bank, healthcare entity or tech - nical support company. The person may call to verify account information, or claims a virus is on your computer to gain access to data remotely (with your permission), or instructs the victim to unknowingly download a malicious attachment. For example, a fraudulent phone call from the IRS indicating that you owe back taxes, etc. Do not provide personal information unless you initiated the contact and verify that the person you are interacting with is legitmate. TAKING SECURITY HOME: WORKING REMOTELY Working away from the office requires the same level of security awareness as if in office and does not exempt anyone from following our policies. The way you access, store, and transfer confidential data must align with our current guidelines. You are prohibited to download or install any software on work devices. It is your responsibility to know if you're allowed to access our organization's network with a personal device and to what extent. Working from home makes you no less of a target for cybercrim - inals. EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 31LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK32Ways to improve security while working remotely include: Keeping your personal and work accounts separate. Keep all personal activity on your personal devices. Shredding or destroying sensitive documents using a cross-cut shredder. Do not leave mobile devices unattended. Locking the door of your workspace if you have a dedicated room for your office. It will help keep out intruders as well as chil - dren, friends, family and pets who like to cause trouble. If you do not have an office, try to work in the same spot and if possible, limit other people' s access to that area. Always lock your screen and other devices if you step away, and lock up papers and removeable media, such as USB drives. Password protect your Wi-Fi (never use default passwords). Using strong passwords and lock your device(s) when not in use. Using discretion when working in public areas, such as coffee shops with free Wi-Fi that are not secure. Avoid handling confi - dential information over an unsecure Wi-Fi that is vulnerable to hackers. INSIDER THREATS FOR END USERS An insider threat is a threat that comes from within DHS or the County . Insider threats are authorized users, such as employees and contract staff who wittingly or unwittingly expose sensitive data or otherwise undermine our efforts to improve and maintain security. Ensure your access is not obtained by unauthorized parties. NEVER share your login credentials, keys, or badges. ALWAYS utilize strong, unique passwords for every account, lock systems when not in use, and refrain from granting access to restricted workplace areas. If you suspect that you've been granted unnecessary access to systems or data, don't assume it was intention - al. Instead, consult management and report the incident. CLOUD SERVICES Cloud services is the on-demand availability of data storage that allows users to access and share files from anywhere with inter - net connectivity. The County of Los Angeles utilizes Microsoft OneDrive as its cloud services provider. The use of any other cloud services provider such as Dropbox, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Drive are strictly prohibited and a violation of DHS Policy 935.20, Acceptable Use of County Information Technology Resources. PRIVACY AND SECURITY DO'S AND DONT'S As a DHS workforce member, it is very important that you safeguard patient health and confidential information. Here are some privacy and security do's and don'ts to help you remember some key points. PRIVACY AND SECURITY DO'S Respect patient privacy and their information and only access, view , or use information needed to do your job. Verify that all documents provided to a patient belong to that patient. Use at least two patient identifiers (additional identifiers if necessary) before providing a patient with medications or documents, such as appointment reminders, discharge summa - ries, and eligibility packets. When verifying, ask the patient to provide their personal information rather than you asking them if they are the correct patient. Delete emails and attachments containing PHI/PII when no longer needed to do your job. Empty your recycle or trash folder regularly and delete no longer needed pictures, files attachments and emails from your desktop, laptop, or phone' s mailbox. Delete files and pictures containing PHI/PII from MS Teams and OneDrive when no longer needed to do your job. Immediately remove all PHI from shared printers, fax machines, and photocopiers. When faxing PHI, be sure to verify if the recipient and phone number are correct and when possible, verify if the recipient received the fax. Discard PHI in secure shredder bins (HIPAA bins) or in cross-cut shredders. Discuss patient care in a private place or speak quietly. Keep medical records and other documents that contain PHI out of public view . Close patient/exam room doors or draw curtains and speak softly when discussing patient care. Treat patient information as if it were your own. Report suspected patient privacy violations through the Safety Intelligence (SI) Event Reporting System AND by phone to the facility Privacy Manager in a timely manner to comply with privacy policies and regulations. Report suspected security incidents to the Enterprise Help Desk via email at helpdesk@dhs.lacounty.gov or by phone (323- 409-8000). Use the \" \" (RPB or PAB) button to report potential phishing emails. EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 32LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK33PRIVACY AND SECURITY DO'S Remove, if safe to do so, or secure PHI found in trash cans and report it to your supervisor and/or the facility Privacy Man - ager. Only use your dhs.lacounty.gov e-mail to send or discuss patient information and encrypt e-mails to be sent outside the DHS e-mail domain. Obtain permission to store e-PHI on a laptop, USB thumb/flash drive or other portable device, and make sure the device is encrypted. Store paper records and medical charts in locked rooms and locked cabinets. Restrict access to computers or computer systems containing e-PHI to authorized users only. Verify the recipient(s) email address(es) before sending communications especially if PHI, employee PII or other confidential information is contained in the email. Do not solely rely on auto-populated names in Outlook. Encrypt emails sent outside of the County that contain PHI/PII or confidential information. Always be careful when using public computers and public Wi-Fi because it' s not secure. Always password protect your home Wi-Fi (change from the factory password that comes with equipment). Position computer workstations and monitors away from public view or use a privacy screen. Log off the computer when you are away from the work area, even if you're coming right back, or when the computer is not in use. If a patient requests a restriction regarding sharing information, such as diagnosis and/or treatment, with family and/or oth - ers, document the request and make sure the treatment team is aware of the request. PRIVACY AND SECURITY DON'TS Don't access information about a patient unless you need it to do your job (even if you personally know the patient). Don't share confidential patient information with anyone who does not need it to do their job. Don't provide PHI/PII to a vendor until you have verified with your Privacy Manager that there is a signed Business Associ - ate Agreement. Do not use a personal laptop, notebooks, or other electronic devices to store PHI/PII or confidential information unless au - thorized by your supervisor and the device is encrypted. Don't store or save patient information on the computer's hard drive. All patient information must be stored on the network drives. Don't share passwords or your computer while logged on. You are responsible for all actions and information viewed while logged in with your credentials. Don't store your password(s) under the monitor, keyboard or inside your unlocked desk. Don't reuse the same password for multiple accounts. Don't use short and simple or personal passwords that are easy to guess (e.g. 1234567890, abcde1234, kid' s names, pet's name, birthdates, etc.). Don't forget to log off shared/public use computers and workstations when you are done or briefly stepping away. Don't e-mail PHI outside of the County e-mail network without authorization. Don't send and discuss patient information or conduct County business through internet-based e-mail sites such as Yahoo Mail, Google Mail, Hotmail, etc. Don't use online web-based document sharing services (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft Office Live, Drop Box, Open-Office, etc.) to store or share patient data. Don't post patient information or discuss patient care such as diagnosis, treatment, patient location, or other information that may be used to identify the patient on social networking websites (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, etc.). Don't take photos and videos of patients for patient diagnosis and treatment with your personal cellular telephone unless you use the secure Microsoft Teams platform, which has replaced HIPAABridge. Don't walk away from open medical records, lab results, etc. Make sure all medical records and lab results are placed in a secure location, out of public view. Don't discard documents or medical supplies that contain PHI in a trashcan. Don't store documents containing PHI in an area where it can be mistaken for trash. Never click on links in emails from unknown or suspicious senders. This could be a phishing email. Don't remove documents containing PHI/PII from the facility unless you have been authorized to do so. Don't forget to remove documents containing PHI from your pockets or from your personal belongings before leaving the workplace; secure or discard it appropriately. Do not access unsecure sites or view confidential information when using public Wi-Fi. Do not permanently store sensitive information in your email. EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 33LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 34DHS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND CODE OF CONDUCT The DHS Compliance Program is a comprehensive strategy to prevent, detect and correct instances of unethical and/or illegal conduct. DHS is committed to conducting its business in a manner that facilitates quality care, excellence, integrity , respect for patients and colleagues, and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. DHS recognizes that its greatest strength lies in the talent and skills of workforce members who perform their jobs competently , professionally, with dedication, and a deliberate focus to provide outstanding customer service. The Compliance Program is committed to working with the entire workforce to make responsible conduct, the hallmark of our patient care and the Department' s overall performance. A significant element of the DHS Compliance Program is the DHS Code of Conduct, which is our guide to appropriate conduct and behaviors. Together with applicable laws, County and Department policies, and program-specific guidelines, we have set standards to ensure that we all do the right thing. These legal and ethical standards apply to our relationships with patients, workforce members, affiliated providers, third-party payers, contractors, subcontractors, vendors, volunteers and consultants. Each workforce member has a personal responsibility to comply with the Code of Conduct and must sign an acknowledgement stating that they will abide by the Code of Conduct and understand that non-compliance with the Code of Conduct can subject them to appropriate corrective action up to and including discharge from County service or termination of assignment. Additionally, you are responsible for reporting any activity that appears to violate the Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct outlines several resources you can use to obtain guidance on ethics or compliance issues or to report a suspected violation. These resources include: Your supervisor or manager Local Compliance Officer DHS Audit and Compliance Division Calls to the Compliance Hotline may be made anonymously; however , anonymous calls may be difficult to investigate. The De - partment will make every effort to maintain, within limits of the law and the practical necessities of conducting an investigation, the confidentiality of the caller's identity. Please note that the Los Angeles County Fraud Hotline and website, operated by the Auditor-Controller, continues to be available to report fraudulent activity. DHS will not retaliate against anyone who reports a suspected violation in good faith. W orkforce members are protected from retaliation by County Code Section 5.02.060, as applicable, as well as by the State of California and federal \"whistleblower\" protections. DHS will not discharge, release, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any manner discriminate against workforce members who exercise their rights under any federal or state whistleblower laws. Workforce members are required to complete Compliance Awareness Training within 60 days of their start of service. The DHS Orientation/Reorientation training offered at each facility will provide annual refresher training thereafter. This training provides workforce members with a better understanding of the Code of Conduct and their role in the Compliance Program. FreepikLAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK EMPLOYEE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 35The False Claims Act (FCA) is a federal law with the intent to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in the healthcare industry. Submission of false claims, statements, or records to federal health care programs can result in huge fines and penalties up to three times the amount of the false claim, plus a civil penalty of $5,500 to $1 1,000 and the cost of the civil action. The law is intended to control fraud in federal and state healthcare programs by giving certain governmental agencies the authority to seek out and investigate violations and prosecute violators. Violators can submit false claims either actually knowing it is false or with \"reckless regard\". The FCA provides workforce members with \"whistleblower protections\" with respect to reporting wrongdoing. Reporters can also, under certain circumstances, bring suit against the violator and be rewarded with a portion of the recovery . Whistleblowers cannot be discharged, demoted, or retaliated against for reporting or participating in an investigation or lawsuit. California has a similar false claims law. Department of Health Services workforce members do not have independent authority to purchase supplies, equipment or services, or commit County funds. Workforce members shall not request or accept goods or services without a purchase order or contract, as this may commit the County to a purchase obligation. Goods or services that are acquired without the proper authority will be identified as unautho - rized. Any workforce member who obtains goods or services from any vendor, without official approval, may be held responsible for payment of goods or services rendered and may also be subject to disciplinary action or release of assignment. Specific delegated signatory authority has been established for the purchase and approval of procurement requests. W orkforce members should contact their facility Supply Chain Operations Division if they have any questions regarding the procurement process or acceptance of goods or services.FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROCUREMENT PROCESSLAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENTThe purpose of this section is to provide workforce members with the conditions of employment set forth by the County and DHS. Below you will find information on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), professional credentials, criminal background checks, the Disaster Service Worker (DSW) program, mandatory reporting of abuse, and reporting suspicious injuries. DHS is firmly committed to equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as well as state law. The ADA prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities during the application process and in all phases of employment. DHS is required to interact with disabled employees to identify reasonable accommo - dations that will enable them to perform the essential functions of their jobs and to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employ - ment. These accommodations might include removing architectural barriers, adjusting a work schedule, and making changes to equipment. The Department will provide a reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of a qualified employee or applicant, unless doing so would pose an undue hardship or direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others. If you feel you need an accommodation for a disability, inform your supervisor, departmental personnel officer or reasonable ac - commodation coordinator immediately. Requests for accommodation will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If you request an accommodation, it is essential that you participate fully in the interactive process to address your request. This participation may include, but is not limited to, providing medical documentation, meeting with specialists, and identifying restrictions and possible accommodations. If you have a disability that is covered under the ADA and you are a qualified individual, you are entitled to reasonable accommo - dation. Please contact DHS Risk Management at (323) 914-6365 for assistance. The Equal Employment Opportunity policy exists to provide equal employment opportunity to all qualified persons, regardless of race, color, religious creed, sex, national origin, ancestry, medical condition, marital status, age, physical or mental disability, sexu - al orientation, or gender identity, and to maintain a non-discriminatory workplace. In developing our equal employment opportunity policy, the Department of Health Services (DHS) is committed to: Recruiting, hiring, training, and promoting persons in all job classifications without regard to any non-job-related characteris - tics. Ensuring that promotional decisions are made in accord with equal employment opportunity requirements by imposing only valid, job related requirements for promotional opportunities. Ensuring that all personnel actions relating to compensation, benefits, transfers, terminations, training, and education are administered in a non-discriminatory manner. Ensuring that no employment practice exists which discriminates against any employee or applicant in any aspect because of sexual harassment from a manager, supervisor, client or fellow employee. Providing a work environment free from harassment and/or other discriminatory practices for all employees. Providing a work environment that complies with federal and state statutes regarding disability and providing an interactive process for those having a disability that limits a major life activity . CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT TITLE I OF ADA - EMPLOYMENT EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY 36LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENTAny workforce member or contractor (County or non-County) whose position requires a current valid professional credential to perform the duties of his/her position shall produce evidence of license, certification, registration and/or permit to Human Resources upon entering County service or assignment. It is the responsibility of the workforce member to renew all required professional credentials or other requirements and to ensure the professional credential is kept in good standing with the appropriate issuing board or agency . Failure to comply with profes - sional credential requirements may subject the workforce member to corrective action, which may include discharge/release from County service or assignment. Primary source verification is required to ensure staff are qualified to provide treatment, care, and services as well as demonstrate to regulatory/accreditation agencies that DHS verifies those qualifications. Some credentialing agencies allow members to block access to online credentialing records. DHS requires unlimited access to review professional credentials. If you are required to maintain a current professional credential to perform your job, it is your responsibility to provide a copy of a renewal professional credential to your supervisor prior to the expiration date. You will not be allowed to work with an expired, suspended, or revoked professional credential. You must notify your supervisor within 24 hours of being notified by the issuing agency that a disciplinary action is being brought against your professional credential. If you observe behavior in a licensed professional that may compromise patient or environmental safety , you should immediately report the behavior by notifying your supervisor or the DHS Human Resources Performance Management Unit. All candidates selected for hire, promotion or transfer from another department, and potential contract/volunteer/student staf f, as specified in DHS Policy 703.1, will participate in a criminal background check. The criminal background check will include Live Scan fingerprinting, conducted by the California Department of Justice (CADOJ) and the FBI. State and federal licensing and ad - ministrative agencies may also be contacted. As part of the criminal background check process, all candidates are also screened during onboarding and monthly through several federal and state exclusion/suspension lists that identify individuals excluded from participating in federal and state health care programs. DHS is prohibited from hiring or maintaining relationships with indi - viduals and entities that have been excluded/suspended or have opted out of Medicare. All information resulting from the criminal background check will be reviewed for conduct incompatible with County employment/ assignment. Any such conduct will be evaluated based on the nature of the conviction, job nexus, and amount of time elapsed since the conviction. If you are arrested or charged with a crime (including traffic violations, if position requires driving on County business) you must report being charged with such crime to DHS Human Resources within 72 hours of becoming aware of the charge. If you are convicted of a crime (including a traffic violation, if position requires driving on County business) you are required to report the conviction to DHS Human Resources (HR) Performance Management (PM) within 24 hours of the conviction. Failure to report may result in disciplinary action, including discharge or termination from assignment. DHS HR PM will review the charges/conviction to determine if a job nexus exists. All information reported to DHS Human Resources will only be released on a \"need-to-know\" basis as required to determine a job nexus.PROFESSIONAL CREDENTIALS (LICENSE/CERTIFICATION/REGISTRATION/PERMIT) It is your responsibility to renew all required professional credentials or other requirements with the appropriate issuing board or agency before the expiration date.REMEMBER CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS 37LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENTThe State of California Disaster Service Worker Volunteer Program (DSWVP) was created as the result of legislation to provide worker's compensation benefits in the event a Disaster Service Worker (DSW) volunteer is injured while performing authorized disaster service duties. All persons employed by the state, any county, city, or public district (public employees), excluding aliens legally employed, are Disaster Service Workers (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3101). Public employees may be activated by their organization to perform disaster ser - vices and are eligible for benefits and liability protections. NOTE: A public employee performing disaster work outside his/her regular job AND without pay, is eligible for State DSW program benefits (Code, \u00a7 3211.92(b)). Registration is required with an Accredited Disaster Council, authorized designee, or Cal OES. In addition, Los Angeles County Code (2.68.060) designates all officers and employees of the County a part of the \"County Emer - gency Organization,\" and can be activated to perform disaster services outside their regular duties. County employees aid the public in the event of an emergency or disaster. All DHS employees are required to complete the new Disaster Service W orker Awareness training on Learning Link. The DSW training does not apply to non-County workforce members. WHAT TO DO WHEN A DISASTER OCCURS When initially alerted, stay calm, ensure your personal safety, and evacuate if instructed to do so. Confirm the safety of your family and property. Once the personal safety of your family is verified, employees should assist in the County's disaster response. If you are at work and have a pre-designated emergency response assignment, you must respond in accordance with that assign - ment. If you do not have a pre-designated assignment, report to your supervisor to receive instructions. A Building Emergency Coordinator (BEC) is located at each facility with 10 or more employees and is responsible for the develop - ment and implementation of the building emergency plan. Listen for instructions from your BEC and/or supervisor regarding steps to take during a disaster or evacuation. Employees who require assistance evacuating may request assistance by completing a \"V oluntary Request for Reasonable Ac - commodation\" form and submitting it to your supervisor/manager, or the facility on-site HR Office or the Department ADA Coordi - nator.

Workforce members are mandated to report the violence as soon as practicably possible to local law enforcement or the Sheriff's Department.The State of California Penal Code mandates that health care practitioners report incidents of suspected or identified child abuse/ neglect, and elder or dependent adult abuse/neglect. Any mandated reporter (all workforce members) who fails to report abuse may be found guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment or a fine. In addition, a mandated reporter who fails to report abuse may be held liable for civil damages for any subsequent injury to the victim. Professionals who are legally required to report suspected abuse have immunity from criminal and civil liability for reporting as required or authorized.REPORTING OF ABUSE/NEGLECT INCIDENTS 39LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENTA SUSPICIOUS INJURY INCLUDES ANY WOUND OR OTHER PHYSICAL INJURY THAT WAS: Inflicted by the injured person's own act or by another where the injury was by means of a firearm; or Is suspected to be the result of assault or abusive conduct inflicted upon the injured person. In accordance with California Penal Code Section 11160, DHS requires any health practitioner working in a DHS health facility, who in his/her professional capacity or within the scope of his/her assignment, who provides medical services to a patient/inmate who he/she knows, or reasonably suspects has a suspicious injury , to report such injury by telephone to local law enforcement immediately or as soon as practicable. Section 1 1160 requires the reporter to make a written follow-up report within two (2) business days to the same local law enforcement agency .

It should be noted that the health practitioner's reporting obligation applies to any law enforcement agency delivering a patient/inmate for intake with a suspicious injury. Reports made to the local law enforcement agencies regarding sus- picious injuries to patients/inmates should be escalated to the facility Regulatory Affairs Unit for tracking and enterprise reporting purposes. Health practitioners working in a DHS health facility, who are engaged in compiling evidence during a forensic medical examination for a criminal investigation or sexual assault, may be asked to release the report to local law enforcement and other agencies. The reports must be prepared on specific forms as required by statute. Health practitioners must follow DHS HIPAA procedures documenting the release of such information.REPORTING SUSPICIOUS INJURIES Freepik 40LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENTDHS workforce members wishing to engage in outside employment activities may do so by completing the Outside Employment form located in the MyLACounty app and obtaining approval. The workforce member must disclose the outside employer, duties, and number of hours worked per week. Outside employment cannot exceed 24 hours per week. Outside employment activities cannot conflict with County duties and cannot be worked during County time or by using County property . Upon hire, and annually thereafter, all workforce members are required to complete and submit an Outside Employment form notifying DHS of outside employment activities, if any. See DHS Policy 740 for more information, such as special conditions for physician post-graduates and appeal process in the event of denial. A conflict of interest exists if a workforce member (WFM) uses their official position to influence a governmental decision in which they have a financial interest. This includes participating in the contracting process. Such practices are prohibited under state law. A WFM has a financial interest in a decision if the decision has a material financial effect on the WFM, WFM's immediate family, or on: Any business entity in which the WFM has an investment of $2,000 or more in which he or she is a director , officer, partner, trustee, employee or manager. Real property in which the WFM has a direct or indirect interest worth $2,000 or more including leaseholds (month-to-month leases are not considered leaseholds); Any source of income to the WFM totaling $500 or more in value provided to, received by , or promised to the WFM within the previous 12 months (includes community property in the interest of the spouse or registered domestic partner); Any business entity in which the WFM holds a position, including executive and management; or Any donor of a gift totaling $500 or more in value provided to, received by or promised to the WFM within 12 months prior to the decision being made. In addition to the list above, there are additional state statutes and regulations which further define a financial interest. Any WFM who believes they may have a financial interest in a decision should immediately discuss the matter with their supervisor. WFMs cannot be involved in the decision to transfer or refer a patient to a private facility in which the WFM has a financial interest. It is the WFM's responsibility to report any potential conflict of interest situations using the Conflict of Interest form. Certain executive level positions and positions with significant influence and involvement with contracts, financial, and other government decisions related to County business are required to annually complete a Form 700, Statement of Economic Interests. The Form 700 is a public document that discloses the financial interests of the positions involved in decision making and makes sure decisions made are in the best interest of the public entity as well as serves as a reminder to those making deci - sions about conflicts of interests or the DHS Human Resources Operations Section. See DHS Policy 740, the DHS Human Resources Operations Section, or DHS Compliance Division for more information.OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST 41LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK42 EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS (UNION REPRESENTATION) EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS (UNION REPRESENTATION) DHS is committed to fostering positive relationships with our labor partners. There are 18 unions representing LA County work - force members. In 2015, The Alliance for Health Integration (Department of Health Services, Department of Public Health, and Department of Mental Health) partnered with several unions to create the Labor Management Transformation Council (LMTC). The County's unique partnerships with our labor partner strengthens staff involvement and brings positive change to DHS. Some of the changes that have come out of our labor partnership include: Standardized emergency codes across DHS Employee engagement survey Just Culture policy Training in Microsoft Office applications Customer service training Distribution of care packages to front line staff during Covid-19 pandemic Continuous performance improvement efforts Involvement of front-line staff in decisions involving system transformation Employee organizations (labor unions) include employees of the County and one of their main purposes is to represent employ - ees in their relationship with the County, such as negotiations regarding benefits, leaves, Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), and other working conditions. Employee organizations also provide a variety of external benefits to their members which may include life insurance, legal services, optional health-, dental-, vision-related services, and recreation discounts. Refer to the table below for information on labor unions and memberships. There are several unions that represent County employees, including those that are part of the Coalition of County Unions, independent unions, and SEIU. Most DHS employees are represented by SEIU Local 721; other labor unions include, but are not limited to, AFSCME, and UAPD. County positions are divided into different categories of Bargaining Units. These Bargaining Units correlate with a specific labor union. Check the profile on your timesheet to determine your Bargaining Unit. New staf f will be given information on the union representing their classification, if any , upon hire. If you have questions, please contact your supervisor/manager or the local HR office.

To that end, we strive to maintain the highest standards in customer service. Our Customer Service and Satisfaction Standards are: Personal Service Delivery Service Access Service Environment PERSONAL SERVICE DELIVERY As a member of the service delivery team, it is critical to our mission that you treat customers and each other with courtesy , dignity and respect at all times. Always: Introduce yourself by name and, when appropriate, SMILE . Treat our customers with courtesy and respect. Listen carefully and patiently to them. Be responsive to their cultural and linguistic needs. Explain procedures clearly. Be courteous when having telephone conversations. Take the extra step to assist customers. If a request cannot be met, explore and suggest other options. Build on the strengths of families and communities. SERVICE ACCESS As a service provider, work PROACTIVELY to facilitate customer access to services by: Providing service as promptly as possible. Providing clear directions and service information. Reaching out to the community to promote available services. Involving patients' families with service plan development. Following-up to ensure appropriate delivery of services. Responding to customer concerns immediately and following up within 24 hours. SERVICE ENVIRONMENT In order to provide services to our customers in a clean, safe, and welcoming environment, you must: Report any unsafe conditions to your supervisor or the LAC+USC Medical Center Safety Officer . Provide a clean and comfortable waiting area/work environment. Protect the privacy and confidentiality of our customers. All staff members can help improve patient satisfaction through courtesy and clear communication. In order to assist staff in doing this, we have implemented a new customer service strategy called AIDET (Acknowledge, Introduce, Duration, Explanation, Thank you). AIDET is a simple acronym that represents a very powerful way to communicate with people who are often nervous, anxious, and feeling vulnerable. The five fundamental principles of AIDET are: CUSTOMER SERVICE AIDET 44LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK CUSTOMER SERVICEAAcknowledge Make eye contact . Smile . Stop what you are doing, so that your patient or visitor knows that they are important . Sample: \"Good morning, Ms. Jones.\" IIntroduce Welcome. State your name. State your role in the patient's care. Sample: \"Welcome to LAC+USC. My name is Jane. I am Dr. Smith's Nurse and will be assisting her with your exam today.\" DDuration Explain how long a procedure will take. Explain how long an interaction will take. Explain how long it will take to get test results back. Sample: \"Dr. Smith ordered an x-ray procedure for you today, just to make sure your finger is not broken. The procedure takes about 15 minutes to complete. Go to the Medical Imaging Department to check-in and when you are done, come back to this office to get your result.\" EExplanation Explain the test or procedure . Explain any post-procedure instructions . Sample: \"Ms. Jones, I will be taking an x-ray image of your finger with this machine. The machine will produce an image of your bone and will allow us to see if your finger is broken. Do you have any questions for me?\" TThank You Let patients know you have enjoyed working with them . Thank them for entrusting us with their healthcare needs . Sample: \"Thank you, Ms. Jones, for allowing us to take care of you. Your follow-up appointment with Dr. Smith has been scheduled. Please let me know if you have any questions.\" The five basic principles of AIDET can be applied by all staff members, and by using them regularly, we can stay true to our commitment of providing quality care and courteous service. TEAMWORK The essential element in a healthcare setting is teamwork. Teamwork is achieved through a shared vision, positive attitudes, mutual respect and effective sharing and application of skills by each team member. Essential elements of teamwork are effective communication, collaboration, coordination of care and conflict resolution. EFFECTIVE WORKPLACE COMMUNICATION Communication is the exchange of thoughts, messages, or information between individuals and groups through speech, signals, writing or nonverbal behavior. Staff must communicate effectively with each other about patient care, treatment and services. Communication takes place in many settings, including formal (as in a meeting), informal (as in a hallway), two-way or multi-way (as in a group). Ineffective communication can lead to failed patient outcomes (patient harm, pain), medical errors, increased medical and malpractice costs, reduced patient trust, decreased staf f satisfaction and retention, and poor productivity and motivation. Barriers to effective communication which include language, age, skill level, poor listening and verbal skills, negative attitudes, time constraints, cultural differences, etc. can lead to misperception, inaccurate messages, embarrassment and failed outcomes. Good communication skills can be learned, practiced, and continuously improved. 45LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKCommunication can take place in any setting (break rooms, meetings, nurses' stations) and it can be in any form: Written: charting notes, reports, e-mail, documents, logs Verbal: talking, teleconferences, telephone Visual: demonstrations, videos Electronic: computer, e-mail, text messages Nonverbal: facial expressions, hand gestures, body movement, stance, tone of voice Leadership must model effective communication by clearly explaining the facility and departmental goals, mission, vision, and values; establishing a culture and environment that encourages communication of ideas, reporting errors and failed outcomes without punishment, and promoting and supporting clear, consistent, open communications and an environment where ideas and suggestions are shared and learning is enhanced. For teamwork to be successful, use these strategies to help improve communication: Be clear and accurate in speech and make sure the other party(ies) understands you. Use short explanations, whenever possible. Demonstrate process/procedure. Ask questions to obtain feedback. Ask listener to repeat to confirm instructions and demonstrate, when possible. Be a good \"active\" listener. Don't take comments and suggestions personally. Create a less stressful environment by having a positive attitude. Be objective. Document accurately. Remember nonverbal communications such as facial expressions, tone of voice, body language and movements, and hand gestures express messages (both negative and positive), intended and unintended. Remember to follow patient privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations when dealing with patient information in any format. PRINCIPLES OF INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION Collaboration involves working together to satisfy the needs of our patient population. High quality patient care is achieved when all workforce members contribute their best efforts in a coordinated manner. Hierarchy, or perceptions of strict levels of power, should not be a barrier to the collaborative effort. DHS workforce members, at all levels of the organization, need to contribute their expertise in order to achieve the best outcomes. In communicating and collaborating, each discipline must accept the concept that each team member has a dif ferent priority related to the issue(s), care planning or task at hand. It is important to identify time commitment, personal expectations, dependencies, and final expected outcomes. An agreement must be obtained on the plan, action(s) to be taken, and responsibility for implementation of each action step. Example 1 : A Physical Therapist schedules to see the patient at 9:00 a.m. When she/he tells the RN about this, they discuss the patient's need for medication prior to the therapy appointment. The RN contacts the physician to discuss the patient's medication needs. The physician sees the patient for reassessment and to discuss the patient's condition and concerns and then renews the medication order. Example 2 : The environmental service worker collaborates with the nurse or his/her supervisor through multiple methods (signs, verbal, training) about the isolation precautions that need to be taken for a safe environment for the patient, staf f and visitors.Team members should learn what information other team members need in order to make decisions about treatment and to create positive outcomes in the workplace.KEY POINT CUSTOMER SERVICE 46LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKCOORDINATION OF CARE Coordination of care requires adequate and efficient communication and collaboration of services. Adequate communication and collaboration between disciplines reduces the potential for errors or oversights. A lack of coordination and collaboration between team members or within a system can lead to: Increased conflicts between team members about a patient's care treatment and services. Compromised patient health and safety. Confusion among team members about what is expected of them and what they can expect from others. Crises caused by false assumptions that someone else is responsible for handling the patient' s care or treatment. Patient care decisions being carried out in a delayed or ineffective manner. Communication and accurate documentation of services between disciplines is the key to providing ef fective coordination of care. Up-to-date information about a patient's care, treatment or services, condition, expected outcomes and anticipated changes must be maintained to ensure appropriate care of the patient. Effective coordination of care makes it possible for patients to feel secure in the knowledge that they are receiving appropriate and timely care. This is a necessary part of the process of developing patient trust. CONFLICT RESOLUTION THROUGH TEAM BUILDING While not unusual for conflict to arise in the workplace, it can lead to positive outcomes for team members as well as patients. Effective problem resolution can lead to a better understanding of processes, systems, and procedures. It allows team members to better understand how other team members' responsibilities and views fit into the scheme of things. Addressing conflict open - ly and constructively can generate new ideas, approaches and process improvements; and promote increased respect for each team member and improve team cohesion. Workforce members should remember these strategies when dealing with conflicts in the workplace: Learn to respect the ideas, suggestions, processes, and contributions of all members of the team, however varied and diverse. For example, physicians, pharmacists, nurses, social workers, and psychologists have been educated to view and process problems in various ways. Each one may have a unique and dif ferent perspective on the problem. Acknowledge and appreciate other disciplines' processes and contributions to ensure that thorough and complete care planning is patient- and family-focused, and outcome oriented. Minimize competition. Each party should feel a sense of contribution to the care plan and the resolution of patient care issues. Ask and respond to questions in a respectful manner, based on the premise that additional exploration of issues is an important method to enhance knowledge and foster collaboration between team members to provide the best possible patient care. Evaluate the facts of the situation and make a determination of the problem. Promote open dialogue and allow all voices to be heard in the exploration of appropriate methods to resolve problems and issues. Keep an open mind and listen to the idea or suggestion being presented. Explore all options before discarding them. When discussing problems remember, the problem is not the person. Separate the person from the equation so that the problem is the focus.Teamwork through effective communication, collaboration, and coordination of care across disciplines can result in positive patient outcomes.KEY POINT CUSTOMER SERVICE 47LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKTHE JOINT COMMISSION THE JOINT COMMISSION'S FOCUS ON PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY SURVEY PROCESS THE JOINT COMMISSION 48For more than 60 years, The Joint Commission has been a champion of patient safety by helping health care organizations improve the quality and safety of the care they provide. The Joint Commission's many patient safety-focused initiatives encourage and support organizations in their efforts to make patient safety a continuous priority . Our focus in preparation for re-accreditation is to use Joint Commission's standards for achieving and maintaining efficient and effective systems to support safe and high- quality patient care. The components of maintaining accreditation include: Focused Standards Assessment (FSA) , previously known as Periodic Performance Review (PPR) - A required self-review of compliance with standards conducted approximately 12 and 24 months following our triennial survey with The Joint Commission (TJC) focusing on the major risk areas. The risk related standards include: All National Patient Safety Goals, standards related to TJC identified risk areas, a subset of indirect and direct impact standards, and standards listed as requirement for improvement (RFI) from our previous triennial survey. Priority Focus Process (PFP) - Process created to collect and analyze information collected about the organization. This helps to focus the survey on areas critical to our quality of care and safety processes. Priority Focus Areas (PFA) - Processes, systems, or structures that can significantly impact the provision of safe, high-quality care and reduce the risk for negative outcomes. System Tracer - Sessions devoted to evaluating three high priority safety and quality-of-care issues on a system-wide basis: Dietetic/Food Service, Infection Control, Medication Management, Pharmaceutical Services, Medical Staff and Data Management. Elements of Performance (EP) - Specific performance expectations in place for each of the standards. Evidence of Standards Compliance - This report provided at the close of the survey documents the standards in which the hospital was in full, partial, or non-compliance; these are also known as Requirements for Improvement (RFIs). SAFER Matrix - All RFIs identified during a TJC survey are plotted on a matrix according to the likelihood that the issue could cause harm to patients, staff, or visitors and the scope at which the RFI is observed. Measure of Success (MOS) - A quantifiable measure, usually related to an audit that can be used to determine whether an action has been effective and is being sustained. Tracer Methodology - Process used by the surveyors to analyze the hospital's systems by following individual patients through their hospitalization in the sequence actually experienced. The surveyor visits the multiple care units, departments or areas to 'trace' the care, treatment and services rendered to a patient. TRACER METHODOLOGY When The Joint Commission surveyors visit our facility, they will spend 70 - 80% of their time in patient care areas conducting tracers . This means that the surveyors will select specific inpatients and review their medical records to determine the services each patient received during their hospitalization. By tracing the course of care and services experienced by the patient (a real time review), the surveyors will interact with direct care providers and/or other applicable workforce members to determine the relationship among departments involved in the care, the integration and coordination of important processes, opportunities for improvement and education (as appropriate) and validation of findings through review of additional records. The surveyors will observe: Direct patient care Medication administration Care planning processes Environment of care (including security) Medical record documentation OTHER SURVEY ACTIVITIES System Tracers Medication Management Data Management Infection Prevention and ControlLAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK Medical Staff Leadership Session Dietetic Service and Food Service Visit Pharmaceutical Services and Clinical Unit Inspection Life Safety Building Code Tour Environment of Care Review and Facility Tour Environment of Care Session with Emergency Management Tracer Program Tracers - Patient Flow and Laboratory Integration Leadership Session Human Resources Interview Medical Staff Credentialing and Privileging Competence Assessment Process Any workforce member who provides care, treatment, and services and has concerns about the safety or quality of patient care is encouraged to make a good faith report of those concerns. The Department of Health Services is prohibited from taking disciplinary action against a workforce member for making a good faith report. However, any workforce member who deliberately makes a false accusation will be subject to discipline/release of assignment. Moreover, reporting a violation does not protect individuals from appropriate corrective action regarding their own misconduct.

The primary objective of the Patient Safety Plan is to create a safe environment for patients, visitors and workforce members by: Improving patient safety, patient safety awareness, and reducing the risk of harm to patients. Ensuring that leadership and staff demonstrate a consistent effort to evaluate, monitor, improve, and document patient safety activities. Establishing systems to assess and improve institutional compliance with The Joint Commission's current National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs). Promoting a \"Just Culture\" that encourages the reporting of errors and near misses. After an incident occurs, there is an emphasis on education and learning, not on finding someone to blame. PROGRAM STRUCTURE The Chief Executive Officer has appointed the chair of the Patient Safety Committee as the Patient Safety Officer . PATIENT SAFETY COMMITTEE (PSC) The PSC is a multidisciplinary committee established to manage the organization-wide Patient Safety Plan and ensure compliance with current The Joint Commission's NPSGs. The PSC also provides leadership and direction for all patient safety initiatives and activities. A Just Culture is one where accountability is fairly balanced between the DHS organization and the individual workforce members. It recognizes that adverse events and unanticipated outcomes are often the result of human error , or system failures, rather than the result of reckless or intentionally malicious behavior. DHS strives to build, maintain, and support a Just Culture. A Just Culture is one in which safety is an individual and organizational priority and where errors, near miss events, adverse events, unsafe conditions, and system problems can be easily reported without retaliation, and are viewed as an opportunity to identify system and behavior changes that will improve the safety and quality of care and services we deliver. Workforce members will not be punished or retaliated against for reporting an error, near miss, adverse event, system problem, safety or quality concern. When indicated, workforce members will be held accountable for reckless, dangerous behaviors and appropriate corrective action taken, even if no patient has been harmed. Actions will be consistent with Just Culture principles, AND with DHS Discipline Manual and Guidelines, County Civil Service Rules, and DHS policies and procedures. W orkforce members will not be held accountable for system flaws over which they have no control. Create and Maintain a Just Culture by: Encouraging staff to recognize and report patient safety issues, and suggest ideas on how we can improve.LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER PATIENT SAFETY PLAN PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAM Know that we have a proactive, multifaceted, and integrated Patient Safety Plan.

Partnering with patients and their families and letting them know how much we appreciate their active participation in making their care as safe as possible. Our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) patient population has historically experienced discrimination on many levels which have directly contributed to identifiable and disproportionately high health disparities Unfortunately, this discrimination is experienced by the LGBTQ+ community while accessing and receiving healthcare as well. LAC+USC Medical Center is committed to providing equitable and inclusive care without regard to sex, economic status, educational background, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, disability , medical condition, marital status, age, registered domestic partner status, genetic information, citizenship, primary language, immigration status (except as required by federal law) or the source of payment for care. To this effect, we have developed and implemented policies that serve to guide practice and protect our LGBTQ+ patients. Inclu - sive to these efforts are extensive guidelines/policies that direct transgender medical care. Protective policies are also extended to workforce members that identify as LGBTQ+. Cumulatively, these policies encourage a healthy and equitable work environment and one that is safe and welcoming to our LGBTQ+ patient population. The Joint Commission and California state law requires healthcare practitioners to be culturally competent with regards to informa - tion pertinent to the appropriate treatment of, and provision of care to, the lesbian, gay , bisexual, transgender, and intersex com - munities. This includes the respective satisfaction of continuing education requirements. Our LAC+USC Medical Center LGBTQ Committee actively encourages and promotes the enhancement of awareness and clinical skills through contemporary education and events.

The Joint Commission approved the first set of NPSGs in July 2002 with specific requirements for improving the safety of patient care in healthcare organizations. The expectation is that the NPSGs or acceptable alternatives are implemented. Patient Safety initiatives are based on meeting the NPSGs, and focusing on system-wide solutions. County workforce members are required to comply with the NPSGs. Each workforce member should be knowledgeable of the NPSGs and how to directly apply them to their service unit. Healthcare OrganizationIdentify Patients Correctly NPSG.01.01.01Use at least two ways to identify patients. For example, use the patient's name and date of birth.

Nonetheless, any of us working in a hospital/patient care area may at times notice a patient/visitor who does not seem to be doing well. What do you do if a patient/visitor appears to you to have fallen, is having trouble breathing, appears unconscious, or is behaving strangely? If you notice a patient/visitor who you believe is in distress or a state of medical emergency , there are facility-specific actions you should take. All workforce members should be aware of how to seek medical assistance. If you are in a patient care area, immediately notify the patient' s nurse. If you cannot tell which nurse to notify, please tell any doctor or nurse in the area that you are concerned about the patient/visitor . Some areas of the hospital are covered by LAC+USC Rapid Response Teams (Code Blue Team and Airway Team). Registered nurses in the areas covered by the Rapid Response Team have been trained in how and when to activate the teams. In other areas, nurses may call the patient's doctor, call a Code Blue or Code White, or call 9-1-1, in response to a change in patient condition. This is why notification of the patient's nurse is the first step in getting assistance for a person who is in possible distress. If you are in a non-patient care area on campus, activate a \"Man Down\" by calling Ext. 1 11 from any hospital phone and stating that there is a person in distress or \"Man Down\". The telephone operator will direct the call to the Base Station in the Emergency Department where a nurse (Mobile Intensive Care Nurse or MICN) will respond to the call. The MICN will obtain basic information regarding the status of the patient. It is at the discretion of the MICN to dispatch the Airway or Code Blue team if the patient appears to be in extremis. If the patient is outside of the area covered by those teams a paramedic ambulance may be dispatched via 9-1-1 (See LAC+USC Medical Center Code Blue Policy #912). If the patient primarily needs transportation for medical assistance, the MICN will contact the appropriate Man Down Team to respond and transport the patient to the Emergency Department. If you are outside the main hospital buildings/areas (such as Rand Schrader Building, Parking Lot 9, School of Nursing, etc.), call 9-1-1 for a medical emergency. At LAC+USC Medical Center, it is important that you know that anyone can call for emergency medical assistance by dialing Ext. 111 from a hospital phone. If you encounter a situation that you feel requires emergency assistance, then you should always act on it by calling for help!

A patient fall is a witnessed or un-witnessed unplanned descent to the floor (or extension of the floor, such as a trash can or other piece of equipment) with or without injury to the patient. All types of falls are to be included whether they result from physiological reasons (fainting) or environmental reasons (slippery floor). This would include assisted falls such as when a staff member attempts to minimize the impact of the fall by easing the patient' s descent to the floor or by breaking the patient's fall. You may encounter visitors, registered or unregistered patients, and staff who may have fallen and who may be in need of assistance. Prevention is the key factor to reduce injury from falls. It is crucial to know how to respond to a fall situation at your facility or in your work environment. Prevention Workforce members can be proactive by being aware of their surroundings and identifying risks for falls. Identifying and Eliminating Hazards : If you see a hazard and you can fix the hazard (e.g. a water/liquid spill), do so. If you can't fix the hazard, promptly notify the proper department, maintenance worker, clinician, and/or area supervisor; according to your facility protocols. Try to secure the area to avoid a potential fall victim. Environmental risks and hazards Include: Wet or slippery floors, spills, debris, clutter, obstructions, stairs, change in surfaces, rugs/floor mats, extension cords, power cords of equipment in use or not in use, ladders, etc. Physical/Cognitive Risks : The elderly and the very young make up the highest percentage of fall victims. Some factors that contribute to fall risk for elderly are: medication usage, confusion, unsteady gait, declined hearing and vision. Some factors that contribute to fall risk for children are: running, climbing, jumping, illness or injury . Fall Risk Communication : Communicating potential hazards anywhere on campus to the correct people in a timely manner can keep staff, visitors, and patients safe from falls and injuries and provide a safer, healthier environment. When a patient is identified as high risk for falls, the nursing staff will place them on \"fall risk\" alert. Nursing staff might place a sign on the door or wall alerting staff to the patient's fall risk, and have the patient wear a wristband or some other modality based on the facility protocols. We must use precautions to prevent patient falls. TIPS FOR PREVENTING FALLS Environmental Identify and eliminate environmental hazards throughout the facility , parking lots, waiting rooms, clinic areas, and patient's rooms. Maintain adequate levels of lighting. Report wet floors, spills, blocked passageways immediately. Remove obstacles and trash on the ground or in passageways/hallways.FreepikFALL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAM 54LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKInpatients wristband, fall precaution sticker on patient's chart, signage, etc. Ensure bed and wheelchair brakes are locked. Ensure patients have non-skid footwear. Keep bed side rails raised during patient transport. Keep bed rails raised when child is not attended by adult. Ensure personal items and call button are within patient's reach. Orient patient and family to the patient's room environment and bathroom facilities. Assist patient in transfers or ambulation, as needed. RESPONSE Workforce members need to know what to do should they encounter a victim of a fall. Expectations to respond to a fall victim : If the person who has fallen is alert and oriented, ask them if they are alright. If there is no apparent injury and the fall victim indicates that they have sustained no injury, offer assistance to help them back to their feet and to resume normal gait. If the fall victim is injured, unsure of injury or disoriented, immediately call for help and remain with the victim. Process for obtaining medical assistance : 1. Notify your supervisor/manager. 2. Dial Ext. 111 to activate the Man Down code. 3. Document the incident via Safety Intelligence (SI) Event Reporting System and follow other reporting procedures. A Man Down will be activated by calling Ext. 111 from any hospital phone and stating there is a person in distress or Man Down. The telephone operator will direct the call to the Base Station in the Emergency Department where a nurse (MICN) will respond to the call. The MICN will obtain basic information regarding the status of the patient/visitor. It is at the discretion of the MICN to dispatch the Airway or Code Blue team if the victim appears to be in extremis. If the victim is outside the area covered by those teams a paramedic ambulance may be dispatched via 9-1-1 (See Policy No. 912, Code Blue). If the victim primarily needs transportation for medical assistance, the MICN will contact the appropriate Man Down team to respond and transport the patient to the Emergency Department. Report environmental hazards to Facility Management or the Facility Safety Officer. Safety concerns/complaints may be made through your supervisor or the facility Risk Manager . In order to monitor, measure, and analyze conditions associated with falls, it is critical that you report ALL falls. If you encounter, witness a fall, help or assist someone whom has fallen; follow the facility's reporting process (or immediately notify your supervisor), so conditions associated with falls can be corrected and documented. Falls are to be reported in the Safety Intelligence (SI) Event Reporting System . Patterns and risks leading to falls can be identified and processes can be developed to improve the safety of the environment. Workforce members without access to the SI should report falls to their supervisor, or the facility Risk Manager, Patient Advocate, or Patient Safety Officer. ELIMINATING OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS Worksite hazards need to be identified and eliminated to improve occupational safety. From parking lots, to your work area/unit, we can all improve occupational safety by being AWARE of the surroundings. Exposure to wet floors or spills and clutter can lead to slips/trips/falls and other possible injuries. Workforce members can reduce or eliminate these hazards by following these tips for providing a safe environment. PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAM 55LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKTips for a Safer Workplace Environment Keep exits free from obstruction. Keep floors clean and dry. Access to exits, hallways and walkways must remain clear of obstructions at all times. Where wet processes are used, maintain drainage, and wear appropriate footwear . Provide warning signs for wet floor areas if you encounter them or are cleaning them. In addition to being a slip hazard, wet surfaces promote the growth of bacteria that can cause infections. Use the handrail on stairs, avoid undue speed, and maintain an unobstructed view of the stairs ahead. Use adequate lighting especially during night hours. Use flashlights or low-level lighting when entering patient rooms. Ensure spills are reported and cleaned up immediately. Be extra cautious in slippery areas such as toilet and shower areas, and outside areas, especially in the rain. Use only properly maintained ladders to reach items. Do not use stools, chairs, or boxes as substitutes for ladders. BE A GOOD SAMARITAN If you encounter a co-worker who looks as though he/she needs assistance (e.g. a co-worker carrying an unstable load, or following unsafe practices), offer assistance to eliminate potential falls or injury. If you see a person with a disability struggling to get out of the car, to stand up, or in apparent need of assistance, you should respectfully offer to help. The suicidal thoughts, also known as suicide ideation, of individuals is often left undetected by healthcare providers. As the suicide rate continues to climb in the United States, it is critical for staf f to detect suicide ideation and take steps to help prevent suicide. DETECTING SUICIDE IDEATION Who is at risk for suicide? Suicide may affect certain groups more than others, however, it is important to know that suicide can affect anyone. Knowing the risk factors is a better indicator of risk than the patient' s demographic information. A patient may not disclose suicide ideation therefore it is important to know and detect the risk factors. What are the risk factors? The risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following: Family history of suicide History of abuse or other trauma Previous suicide attempts Self-inflicted injury Alcohol or drug abuse Depression, bipolar disorder, or other psychiatric disorders Serious illness, pain, or physical limitations Social isolation, aggression, or antisocial behavior Discharge from psychiatric facilities or other change in treatment Access to firearms/lethal weapons Triggering events, such as loss of relationship or job Not every individual who exhibits one or more of these symptoms will attempt suicide, in fact, most do not. However , identifying these risk factors in a patient will allow you to take appropriate steps to refer the patient to a provider for screening, risk assessment, and treatment. If you suspect a patient is having suicide ideation, notify your supervisor .SUICIDE PREVENTION PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAM 56LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAMSAFE-T SAFE-T stands for Suicide Assessment Five-step Evaluation and Triage. These are the five steps: 1. Risk Factors: Know the risk factors (see above for a list of risk factors). 2. Protective Factors: Protective factors include the ability to cope with stress, religious beliefs, frustration tolerance, a feeling of responsibility to children or other loved ones, positive relationships and social support. Although protective factors can be enhanced, they may not counteract acute risk. 3. Suicide Inquiry: Conduct a suicide inquiry and ask specific questions about suicide ideation, any plans they may have, including timing, locations, past or aborted attempts, rehearsals, and self-injury . 4. Risk Level/Intervention: After completing steps 1-3 assess the risk level and reassess as the patient or the environment changes. 5. Document: Document results of the assessment and include a justification. There should also be a treatment plan to address/reduce the current risk and a follow up plan. Parents and guardians should be included in treatment plans involving youth. 57LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAMEach and every patient who walks through our doors has the right to receive \"ef fective and caring service\" in a safe environment free of safety risks. This includes patients at risk for suicide or those who may harm themselves or others. DEFINITION: A ligature risk (point) is defined as anything which could be used to attach a cord, rope, or other material for the purpose of hanging or strangulation. Ligature points include shower rails, coat hooks, pipes, and radiators, bed frames, window and door frames, ceiling fittings, handles, hinges and closures. WHAT ARE THE RISKS? The goal for our patients at risk of suicide or self-harm is to have a ligature free environment. Common ligature points include doors, hooks/handles, and windows. Common ligatures are belts, sheets, and towels, with a recent increase in the use of shoelaces. Other risks to look out for include furniture or anything that can be thrown or moved, sharp objects, areas where the patient isn't visible to staff, plastic bags, tubing or other medical equipment or supplies that can be used for suffocation or strangulation, windows that open or are breakable, harmful medications, accessible light fixtures, and non-tamper proof screws. WHAT YOU CAN DO TO MINIMIZE RISK Patients with psychiatric issues in a hospital setting may be at higher risk for suicidal ideations and should be screened and monitored as appropriate to their level of risk. As with any person that demonstrates suicidal ideation, they may require a mental health referral/evaluation, greater vigilance, and protection, such as periodic check-ins, one-to-one monitoring, and removal of potentially dangerous objects, as listed above.

Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act into law. This landmark civil rights law is a critical part of the HHS Office for Civil Rights' (OCR) disability non-discrimination work, along with Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. What is Section 504? Section 504 is part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973: a federal law that protects individuals from discrimination based on disability. Under this law, individuals with disabilities may not be excluded from or denied the opportunity to receive benefits and services from certain programs. What is Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act? Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is another law that prohibits disability discrimination. It applies to all state and local government agencies and offers protections similar to Section 504. DHS NONDISCRIMINATION NOTICE The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS) complies with applicable federal civil rights laws and does not discriminate on the basis of language, culture, size, gender, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, socioeconomic status, physical or mental ability or disability. To whom do these laws apply? Section 504 applies to entities that receive financial assistance from any federal department or agency , including the U.S. De- partment of Health and Human Services (HHS). These entities include many hospitals, nursing homes, mental health centers and human service programs. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at HHS, ensures that entities receiving federal financial assistance comply with these laws. Title II of the ADA applies to all state and local government agencies, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance. What does effective Communication for Persons Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing entail? Effective communication with a qualified person who is deaf or hard of hearing is communication that allows the person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of a service, program, or activity . This can mean communicating with a patient or their companion through lip-reading, written notes, or a Sign Language interpreter . It is important to ask the deaf or hard of hearing person what works best for them.

According to DHS' \"Language Report\" database for Fiscal Year 2019 - 20 PATIENTS' RIGHTS AND SERVICESSPIRITUAL NEEDS OF PATIENTS The Department of Spiritual Care at LAC+USC Medical Center provides for the spiritual health and well-being of the patients, their families, friends and staff through active listening, prayer, sacred texts (e.g. Bible, Koran) and administration of sacred rituals such as Sacraments. We seek to promote wellness by giving comfort to those desiring the services of our interfaith along with our staff Christian chaplains. Our chaplains are available to minister to all patients, their family members, friends and hospital staff, regardless of their religious preference. Emergency chaplains are available 24 hours a day through referrals by nurses at any unit. Chaplains (available in English, Spanish, Korean, and Chinese) will attempt to visit every patient, every few days. W eekly visits also include a person of the Jewish, Islamic and Jehovah's Witness tradition. Referrals to the Chaplaincy program may be made by having a nurse call or by ORCHID request. For an urgent request, a nurse can page the appropriate emergency chaplain. Chaplaincy services offered include: Pastoral care visits, spiritual and grief counseling, Holy Communion/Anointing of the Sick Confession, spiritual literature, Sunday worship services, Bible study (staf f), prayer and spiritual support groups. Chapels are located in Inpatient Tower, 2nd floor.

The AHCD allows patients to determine whether or not they want life-sustaining treatment if terminally ill or permanently unconscious. It also allows patients to name representatives to state their desires about their healthcare, when they are unable to do so. LAC+USC Medical Center Nursing Staf f are responsible for informing patients of their options regarding an AHCD. A patient can also give an AHCD verbally to a physician who will document it in the patient's medical record. The Advanced Health Care Directive form is available on the LAC+USC Medical Center intranet. Staff MUST ensure a copy of the AHCD is in the medical record. If you are directly involved in the care of a patient who wishes to execute an AHCD, or to discuss this option, please contact the Clinical Social Work Department or the patient's physician. Remember patients who are of sound mind can change their mind at any time regarding AHCDs. DHS does not discriminate on the basis of disability in access to services, programs or activities. Qualified individuals with disabilities may not be denied access to or use of facility services, programs or activities. A \"qualified\" individual is one who meets the eligibility criteria for the services being offered. To ensure treatment, a program access standard must be met; each service must be accessible to and usable by people with disabilities when viewed in its entirety. Programs and services must be designed to accommodate all persons regardless of disability. Patients and their family and/or visitors who have a disability covered under the ADA are entitled to request reasonable accommodations that do not pose an undue hardship to DHS. Effective communication will be ensured in the form of auxiliary aids or services, including sign language interpreters, alternate format materials or assistive listening devices, to the extent possible. All access services will be provided at no cost to the user, as long as they do not create undue hardship on County resources. Departmental policy , practice or procedure may need to be reasonably modified to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability . Primary consideration shall be given to the specific auxiliary aid and/or service requested by the person with a disability . A patient has the right to not participate in any program or service designed specifically for persons with disabilities. DHS has adopted an informal complaint procedure to investigate and resolve general complaints that allege DHS has not complied with the ADA. Patients may address concerns regarding access to services or reasonable accommodations to their care provider, the facility Patient Advocate, or the Departmental ADA Coordinator. Although complaints may be addressed at this level, the patient or the public retain the right to file a complaint directly with the appropriate state or federal agency . (Source: California Hospital Association, ADA-Revised Service Animals Requirements, Effective March 15, 2011) Service animal means any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not service animals. The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the handler's disability. Example of work or tasks include, but not limited to, assisting individuals who are blind or have low vision with navigation and other tasks, alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to the presence of people or sounds, providing non-violent protection or rescue work, pulling wheelchairs, assisting an individual during a seizure, alerting individuals to the presence of allergens, retrieving items such as medicine or the telephone, providing physical support and assistance with balance and stability to individuals with mobility disabilities, and helping persons with psychiatric and neurological disabilities by preventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive behaviors. The crime deterrent effects of an animal's presence and the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship do not constitute work or tasks. Service animals are working animals, not pets. A sight-impaired individual who is allergic to dogs may use a miniature horse (generally range in height from 24 inches to 34 inches and generally weigh between 70 and 100 pounds). However, the miniature horse must be trained to provide assistance to the individual with a disability and must be house broken.ADVANCED HEALTH CARE DIRECTIVES AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA) SERVICE ANIMALS PATIENTS' RIGHTS AND SERVICES 66LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), businesses and organizations that serve the public must allow people with disabilities to bring their service animals into all areas of the facility where customers are normally allowed to go. This federal law applies to all businesses open to the public, including restaurants, hotels, taxis and shuttles, grocery and department stores, hospitals and medical offices, theaters, health clubs, parks, and zoos. Businesses may ask if an animal is a service animal and ask what tasks the animal has been trained to perform, if it is not obvious, but cannot require special ID cards for the animal or ask about the person' s disability. The service animal must be permitted to accompany the individual with a disability to all areas of the facility where customers/patients are normally allowed to go. People with disabilities who use service animals cannot be charged extra fees, isolated from other patrons or treated less favorably than other patrons. However, if a business normally charges guests for damage that they cause, a customer with a disability may be charged for damage caused by his/her service animal. A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his/her service animal from the premises unless: 1. The animal is out of control and the animal's owner does not take effective action to control it; or 2. The animal poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others. In these cases, the business should give the person with a disability the option to obtain goods and services without having the animal on the premises. Businesses that sell or prepare food must allow service animals in public areas, even if state and local health codes prohibit animals on premises. Businesses are not required to provide care or food for a service animal or provide a special location for it to relieve itself. Allergies and fear of animals are generally not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people with service animals. A service animal may not be restricted from its handler who is a patient in the hospital. The hospital staff and the patient with the disability should discuss the possible need for the service animal to be separated from the patient for a period of time during non- emergency care as well as a plan of care for the service animal in the event the patient is unable to provide care. This plan may include family members taking the animal out of the facility several times a day for exercise or elimination, the animal staying with relatives, or boarding off-site. Care of the service animal will remain the responsibility of the patient with the disability and not the hospital staff. \"Facility animals\" are used for the purpose of therapy programming only and are not to be considered as Service Animal under the ADA. Violators of the ADA can be required to pay monetary damages and penalties. If you have additional questions concerning ADA and service animals, please call the HR Manager and ADA Coordinator at (747) 210-3313, DHS Risk Management at (323) 914- 6365, or the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division ADA Information Line at (800) 514-0301. INTRODUCTION Baby-Friendly USA, Inc. is the U.S. authority for the implementation of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (\"BFHI\"), a global program sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The initiative encourages and recognizes hospitals and birthing centers that offer an optimal level of care for breastfeeding mothers and their babies, based on the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. WHY BREASTFEEDING MAKES A DIFFERENCE Importance of exclusive breastfeeding Exclusive breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition and health protection. WHO recommends breast milk as the natural first food for babies, it provides all the energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first six months of life. Exclusive breastfeeding reduces infant mortality due to common childhood illness such as diarrhea or pneumonia, and helps for a quicker recovery during illness. Breastfeeding offers an unmatched beginning for our children Human milk provides the optimal combination of nutrients and antibodies necessary for each baby to grow healthy . Scientific stud - ies have shown us that breastfed children have fewer and less serious illnesses.BABY-FRIENDLY INITIATIVE PATIENTS' RIGHTS AND SERVICES 67LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKMothers who choose to breastfeed are healthier Recent studies show that women who breastfeed enjoy lower risks of breast and ovarian cancer , anemia, and osteoporosis. Families who breastfeed save money In addition to the fact that breast milk is free, breastfeeding saves on health care costs and time lost to care for sick children. Communities reap the benefits of breastfeeding Research shows that there is less absenteeism from work among breastfeeding families. Families who breastfeed have more money available to spend on goods and services, thereby benefiting the local economy . The environment benefits when babies are breastfed Scientists agree that breast milk is the best way to nourish our babies, and may protect babies from some of the ef fects of pollution. Since there is no waste in breastfeeding, each breastfed baby cuts down on our pollution and garbage disposal problems. LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER RECEIVES BABY FRIENDLY DESIGNATION In April 2012, LAC+USC Medical Center became one of the first facilities in the nation to receive from Baby-Friendly USA the prestigious international recognition as a Baby-Friendly\u00ae birth facility . LAC+USC Medical Center had its Baby-Friendly redesignation site visit in June 2017.

Organ donation may include patients who are not brain dead whose family have elected to withdraw the ventilator . Death is therefore declared on the basis of cardiopulmonary criteria (irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory function) and is called specifically \"Donation after Cardiac Death\" (DCD). The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) establishes specific responsibilities for physicians attending to the Emergency Department patient. EMTALA serves to provide structure to the proper examination, treatment and transfer of Emergency Department patients. A hospital that operates an emergency department must provide a medical screening examination to anyone on whose behalf a request is made for examination or treatment. The purpose of the examination is to determine whether or not the individual is in an emergency medical condition. This is defined as a medical condition that could reasonably be expected to result in placing the health of the individual in serious jeopardy , serious impairment of bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. With respect to a pregnant woman, this includes the health of the woman and her unborn child.All potential organ/tissue donors must be referred to OneLegacy 24-hour donor referral line at (800) 338-6112REMEMBER EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND ACTIVE LABOR ACT (EMTALA) PATIENTS' RIGHTS AND SERVICES 69LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKThis section describes the requirements for a safe patient care environment.

To protect our workforce members from an act of violence or threat of violence that occurs at our work site, LAC+USC Medical Center has a Workplace Violence Prevention Plan. The County of Los Angeles has a \"zero tolerance\" policy that addresses work - place violence and violent behavior. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge from County service or assignment. If you observe violence or signs of violent behavior , notify your manager or supervisor and the facility security. Please refer to DHS policy on workplace violence for further information.

WORKPLACE VIOLENCE 73LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK ENVIRONMENT OF CAREThe Crisis Cycle Workplace violence doesn't occur without warning. It is usually the third or fourth stage in the Crisis Cycle. Knowing the different stages will allow you to better identify and address potential danger . 1st Stage of Crisis - Anxious Person Anxious person - defined by a notable change/increase in behavior. Behaviors include: pacing, finger tapping, wringing hands, asking questions, appearing distracted or withdrawn, and increase in vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate). Staff response should be supportive with an empathic, nonjudgmental approach. Examples include: listening, of fering reassurance, providing information, and utilizing therapeutic considerations such as: Personal space - an area surrounding the body that varies from person to person. Invasion of personal space increases anxiety for everyone and decreases safety. Staff can honor personal space by maintaining at least a leg's length away. Kinesics - the non-verbal message transmitted by the motion and posture of the body . Staff can decrease anxiety and send a positive message by maintaining an open body posture, interested facial expression, non-threatening gestures, offering eye contact, and by smiling (depending on the situation). Paraverbal communication - the vocal part of speech, excluding the actual words used. Staf f should speak with a smooth, calm, and reassuring voice. The voice volume should be controlled and appropriate for the setting. \"Calming words\" and a \"positive attitude\" have the power to calm anxiety , so be aware of your tone of voice, choice of words, and body language. 2nd Stage of Crisis - Defense Person Defensive person - defined by a loss of rationality; sometimes referred to as the verbally abusive stage. Behaviors include: yelling, screaming, belligerent language including the use of profanities, and challenging authority . Staff response should focus on taking control of a potentially escalating situation by setting limits that are simple, clear , reasonable, enforceable, non- challenging, and non-threatening. Staff members should remain calm, start with positive choices, allow the defensive person to blow off steam, remove the audience, and avoid power struggles. 3rd Stage of Crisis - Person in Crisis Person in crisis - defined by the total loss of rational control that results in a physical acting-out episode. This is sometimes referred to as the physically abusive stage. Behaviors include: engaging in dangerous actions and not responding to verbal interventions, hurting self or others, placing patient or others in imminent danger such as hitting, kicking, biting, grabbing, pulling, choking or throwing objects. Staff response should focus on avoiding solo intervention, using non-harmful personal safety techniques to escape, and activating the appropriate emergency code. Physical intervention is used as a last resort when alternative measures have been considered and are ineffective. Alternative measures include: continued verbal intervention, setting limits, offering anti-anxiety medication, and continued observation. 4th Stage of Crisis - Tension Reduction Tension reduction - defined by the decrease of physical and emotional energy where the individual begins to regain control of their emotions; sometimes referred to as the post-crisis stage. Behaviors include: apologizing, crying, withdrawing, sleeping, and expressing feelings of remorse. Staff response should be focused on building a therapeutic rapport with the individual and avoid blaming the individual for their actions. This is accomplished by debriefing with the individual to discover what happened from their perspective, identifying triggers, and contracting on strategies to avoid the behavior in the future. This debriefing can be performed using the acronym \" COPING \": Remember \"COPING\" COPING is the steps to remember when talking to the individual in crisis: Control - make sure the individual is calm Orient - orient individual to what just happened Patterns - What things triggered the crisis Investigate - what needs to change to prevent a crisis Negotiate - Contract to make changes Give - give back control to the individual 74LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK ENVIRONMENT OF CAREAvoiding Physical Harm Most violent behavior occurs after warning signs. The following cues are indicators of possible violence approaching: Verbal Cues Speaking loudly, yelling, swearing or using a threatening tone of voice Non-verbal or Behavior Cues Poor hygiene or symptoms of intoxication and/or drug abuse Aggressive or threatening posture Arms crossed on chest or clenched fists Heavy breathing, pacing or agitation A scared look or a fixed stare Thrown objects or sudden changes in behavior Incident Reporting To report violent incidents to law enforcement call the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department at ext. 3333 Report all workplace violence incidents in the Safety Intelligence (SI) Event Reporting System! Workplace Violence Emergency Codes Code Gold - Called when there is an emergent issue with a patient's mental state and there is the potential to bring harm to them - selves or others. A Behavioral Response Team (BRT) will respond in ER, a second team to Inpatient situations. Patients may be placed in restraints. Assist the Team as directed. All other buildings must call Code Gray for assistance. Code Silver - Called when there is a person with a weapon, active shooter and/or hostage situation. Notify - Warn others of the situation. Escape - Evacuate if it is safe to do so. Hide Out - Seek cover/protection. Assist patients in seeking shelter/protection. Take Action/Fight - Only as a last choice. Code Gray - called when there is a combative person or situation. Contact security or the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department at ext. 3333. Assist victims(s) and remain calm and non-combative (diffuse the situation if possible). Clear the area of non-involved persons. Dress with Safety in Mind Remove anything you are wearing that can be used as a weapon or grabbed by someone. Avoid wearing earrings, stethoscope, necklaces or other items that can be pulled. Glasses, keys or name tags dangling from cords/chains can be hazardous. Use breakaway safety cords or lanyards. Long hair should be put up or tucked away so that it can't be grabbed. Remember \"STAMP \" STAMP stands for the five visible elements of behavior that can indicate a person' s potential or likelihood for becoming violent. Staring and eye contact Tone and Volume of voice Anxiety Mumbling Pacing As the risk of violence increases, the number of observable STAMP cues will typically increase. 75LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKWorkplace Violence Prevention Resources Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Licensed mental health professionals are available to assist employees and their dependents with personal or situational stress that interferes with their well-being, day-to-day functioning and carrying out their job responsibilities. https://employee.hr.lacounty.gov/employee-assistance-program/ Department of Mental Health 24/7 ACCESS Hotline Free, confidential mental health information, referrals to service providers and crisis counseling.

Emergency Management (EM) involves the planning, preparedness, and response activities for emergency and disaster events, internal or external, which affect the LAC+USC Medical Center, and, as a coalition partner, Los Angeles County as the Operational Area. The LAC+USC Medical Center has a comprehensive Emergency Management Program (EMP). Primary responsibility for the development and oversight for the EMP are Hospital Leadership, the Office of Emergency Management (OEM), and Emergency Management Committee (EMC) which is chaired by the Emergency Management Officer (EMO) and reports to Executive Leadership. They strategize and approve EM activities, facilitate in executing EM scope of work, and facilitate compliance with EM mandates including: Regulatory EM requirements for: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR): Hospital Preparedness Program National Fire Protection Association (NFPA): NFPA 99 Health Care Facilities Code, 2012 Edition Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS): 42 CFR Part 482 California Department of Public Health (CDPH): Title 22, 24 The Joint Commission: EM Chapter County of Los Angeles / Department of Health Services Conducting and publishing the annual Hazard Vulnerability Analysis Developing, reviewing, and revising the Emergency Operations Plan Conducting 2 drills per year, at a minimum Ensuring Hospital Command Center readiness 24/7, Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) compliance, and National Incident Management System (NIMS) implementation activities Emergency Operations Plan : The Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) establishes operational procedures and guidelines for potential or actual emergencies that fall on a continuum of disruptive to disastrous that can adversely impact the organization' s ability to provide care, or the environment of care itself, or that result in a sudden, significantly changed, or increased demand for the organization' s services. The EOP is an all-hazards plan. It also contains Incident Response Plans (IRP) for specific events including: Earthquakes, Evacuations, Power Failure, and Water Emergencies. The plan is to be implemented at any time deemed necessary to manage an incident, for internal/external disasters, healthcare emergencies, patient surge, a multi-casualty / mass casualty incident (medical, trauma, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high yield explosives), or when needs are greater than resources. This plan will remain in effect until that time that the event and its effects are resolved and the medical center can return to normal operations. The EOP is activated via the hospital emergency code: Code Triage [Internal, External]. EOP activation then necessitates establishing the Hospital Command Center (HCC) and implementing the HICS which is the standardized management tool for incidents. Authority to activate the EOP includes Executive Leadership, Administrator on duty, and the EMO.DISTANCE , SHIELDING , and TIME are the best defenses from radiation exposure.REMEMBER EMERGENCY AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT 78The EOP can be accessed via the intranet homepage under Departments: Administrative Services: Emergency Management. The Hospital Command Center phone number is (323) 409-1443. Departments may have internal Emergency Response Plans (ERP) for department-specific procedures to follow in the event of an emergency or disaster. Staff should be familiar with these. Contact your supervisor for more details. Communications : Code Triage notification will come from the Telephone Office and the Enterprise Help Desk (EHD). The Telephone Office will provide overhead paging and desktop VOIP phone speakers systems. The EHD will provide notification via Outlook Broadcast Notification and the Everbridge Notification System. The facility has usual and redundant modalities that may be implemented during an emergency or disaster including: overhead paging; desktop VOIP phone speaker paging; telephone system (analogue red phones, digital lines, and VOIP wired/wireless lines; Everbridge notification system; Outlook email; Microsoft Teams, VMED28 radio, ReddiNet, HAM radio, and Satellite phone). Additional options during an emergency may include the use of runners and personal cell phones. Staff Responsibilities : During an incident, all staff are required to report to their duty station and direct line of authority. This includes: County, non- County ; administrative, medical, nursing, and ancillary workforce members; Residents and Fellows in meetings, grand rounds, on call, or on elective. Staff may be held-over and/or called-in as needs dictate. During an incident, all departments/units/services shall implement their respective unit-/service-based procedures or ERP' s, if available. The department/unit/service supervisors/managers shall evaluate their specific area's operational status, staffing needs, and available personnel to their department director. This information is forwarded to the HCC via their respective Operations branch. Non-essential services or day-to-day functions not directly related to the emergency response may be suspended for the duration of the incident, if necessary. Space may be flexed/re-purposed. Personnel may be redeployed/reassigned to different locations. Personnel may be required to perform duties not related to their normal assignment (but not above their capability). Just-in-time training may be necessary. The overseeing unit or service will be responsible for this function. Resources and Supplies : Each unit or service will obtain and/or replenish needed resources and assets through their normal procedures including, but not limited to: personnel, supplies, equipment, pharmaceuticals, Environmental Services (EVS), and Laundry Services. Should standard methods be insufficient, the department/unit/service supervisor/manager will place a request with the HCC / Logistics Section. The Logistics Section will then assist in obtaining the requested resource or asset. Their function will be to: Provide support to other sections. Acquire resources from internal / external sources.

This helps to prevent injuries and improve efficiency. COMMON CAUSES AND TYPES OF ERGONOMIC INJURIES Strains and sprains (most often to the back, fingers, ankles and knees due to improper lifting or carrying techniques). Repetitive motion injuries (most often to fingers, hands, wrist, neck and back from repeating a motion over and over , or from poor posture or positioning). Eyestrain, headaches and fatigue (due to noise, poor lighting, posture or positioning). RISKS FACTORS TO REMEMBER 1. Your posture . Poor body mechanics overworks your body and puts stress on your joints. Even with good posture, a position if held for too long, can tense your muscles. It is always important to change your position frequently throughout the day to relieve pressure and stress on your body. 2. Your tasks . Watch for activities that require excessive force or frequent repetition. Also be aware of contact forces, such as pressing a body part against a hard surface or a sharp edge for prolonged periods of time. An example would be leaning against the edge of the desk. Frequent repetition for long periods make the muscles tense and tired. 3. Your work area . Environments with high stress, noise, poor lighting, poor seating, uncontrollable room temperature, vibrations, etc., can add extra strain to your body. Be aware of broken equipment, chairs or stools. Do not use them and report them to your supervisor immediately. TAKE CONTROL OF THE RISK FACTORS AND BE PROACTIVE 1. Recognize the force or strain placed on your body caused when you grip, push, pull or lift heavy materials. Think about ways to minimize these strains or avoid some of these movements. Be aware of pain or numbness in the neck, shoulders, arm, wrist, fingers and back. Immediately, report any work related injuries to your supervisor. 2. Alternate tasks to use different muscles and to give you time to recover. Pace yourself. 3. Use eyeglasses, if needed. Remember uncorrected vision problems can cause eyestrain. Remember to blink and look away from the monitor frequently to decrease strain on your eyes. 4. Use tools in a safe and appropriate manner. Keep your worksite safe and clean. Do not use unsafe tools, remove them and report them. 5. Report any worksite safety concerns to your supervisor. This will help your manager identify harmful patterns or environmental conditions so that necessary changes may be made. 6. Ergonomic worksite evaluations are available through the Safety Office. To request an evaluation, please notify your supervisor, then go to https://lacounty.sharepoint.com/sites/dhs-ergonomics and fill out the self-assessment form. 7. Keep yourself fit with regular exercise and proper diet, and manage your daily stress. ADJUST YOUR EQUIPMENT AND/OR WORKSTATION Suggestions to follow: 1. Adjust the height of your chair to achieve proper posture. Position hips, knees and elbows at approximately a ninety-degree angle. Your shoulders should be relaxed and elbows kept close to your body. Feet should be flat on the floor or supported by a step if they are dangling. Avoid stretching, twisting or bending beyond what is comfortable for you. Know how to adjust your chair. If the chair controls are not working properly, notify your supervisor. 2. Position your monitor directly in front of you. Adjust the monitor screen so it sits at or below eye level. Sit at least an arm's length away from the computer screen. 3. Check the lighting to reduce monitor screen glare. Aim the light at the task, not the screen. Adjust the contrast and brightness of your monitor to improve viewing comfort at your computer workstation. 4. Change your position, stretch and change your pace of work regularly throughout the day .ERGONOMICS 84 FreepikLAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKThe mission of the LAC+USC Medical Center Performance Improvement Program is to facilitate, support and train teams of medical and all other LAC+USC staff in adopting the management system, culture, tools and methodologies based on learned principles, adapted to the LAC+USC environment, to focus on relentless continuous improvement that delivers best in class patient experience, employee satisfaction, operational excellence, clinical quality and outcomes, and financial performance.

Hazardous (or \"unsafe\") Condition(s): A circumstance (other than a patient's own disease process or condition) that increases the probability of an adverse event. Adverse Event : A patient safety event that resulted in harm to a patient. Identifying something as an adverse event does not imply \"error,\" \"negligence\" or poor quality of care. It simply indicates that an undesirable clinical outcome resulted from aspect of diagnosis or therapy, not an underlying disease process. The California Health and Safety Code identifies 28 specific adverse events that must be reported to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Reportable adverse events are: 1. Surgery performed on the wrong body part that is inconsistent with the documented informed consent for that patient. A reportable event does not include a situation that occurs in the course of surgery or a situation that is so urgent as to preclude obtaining informed consent. 2. Surgery performed on the wrong patient. 3. The wrong surgical procedure performed on a patient, which is a surgical procedure performed on a patient that is inconsistent with the documented informed consent for that patient. A reportable event does not include a situation that occurs in the course of surgery or a situation that is so urgent as to preclude obtaining informed consent. 4. Retention of a foreign object in a patient after surgery or other procedure, excluding objects intentionally implanted as part of a planned intervention and objects present prior to surgery that are intentionally retained. 5. Death during or up to 24 hours after induction of anesthesia after surgery of a normal, healthy patient who has no organic, physiologic, biochemical, or psychiatric disturbance and for whom the pathologic processes for which the operation is to be performed are localized and do not entail a systemic disturbance. 6. Patient death or serious disability from contaminated drug/device/or biologic provided by the health facility when the contamination is the result of generally detectable contaminants in the drug, device, or biologic, regardless of the source of the contamination or the product.

CDPH Reportable Adverse Events must be immediately reported to your direct supervisor, reported to Risk Management via the telephone operator, and entered into the Safety Intelligence Event Reporting System, a web-based, DHS-wide system accessible from the LAC+USC Medical Center Intranet Webpage. Sentinel event : A patient safety event (not primarily related to the natural course of the [patient's] illness or underlying condition) that reaches a [patient] and results in death, severe harm (regardless of duration of harm), or permanent harm (regardless of severity of harm). Severe harm : An event or condition that reaches the individual, resulting in life-threatening bodily injury (including pain or disfigurement) that interferes with or results in loss of functional ability or quality of life that requires continual physiological monitoring or a surgery, invasive procedure, or treatment to resolve the condition. Permanent harm : An event or condition that reaches the individual, resulting in any level of harm that permanently alters and/or affects an individual's baseline. A sentinel event is one of the following (even if the outcome was not death or major permanent loss of function unrelated to the natural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition): Suicide of any patient in a setting where the patient receives around-the-clock care or suicide of a patient within 72 hours of discharge. Unanticipated death of a full-term infant. Discharge of infant to the wrong family.

However, if you have knowledge of an event and fail to report it or deliberately make a false accusation, this is against LAC+USC Medical Center Policy; and, there is a possibility that you may be disciplined for failure to report. Remember: Notify your department supervisor whenever possible before reporting a case to the Risk Management Office. Do not make copies of the SI reports and do not refer to the SI reports in the patient's medical record. In addition, keeping separate notes regarding events may not be protected under the attorney/client privilege. Therefore, you are discouraged from keeping separate notes regarding events. All information related to the event should be included in the SI report. The medical record is the most important part of the defense against any potential litigation alleging malpractice. It is the permanent record of documented care and treatment rendered to a patient. A well- kept record is the most important key in any defense. In a timely manner, document in the medical record all care, treatment given, and changes in the patient's condition. Do not make reference to a SI report or Risk Management in the patient's medical record. Do not make copies of the SI report. Please also note that comments regarding coverage discussions, disputes among services, or clinician/staff behavior, etc. should not be recorded in the medical record, which is a document with the sole purpose to accurately record the care provided to a patient. As applicable, such issues can be reported to Hospital Administration or recorded in the Safety Intelligence (SI) Event Reporting System or Statement of Concern form, as appropriate. YOUR DOCUMENTATION MUST INCLUDE: Date Time MAKE YOUR DOCUMENTATION: Objective Clear Legible Relevant CORRECT HANDWRITTEN ERRORS IN THE MEDICAL RECORD BY: Using one line to cross out the error(s).

Providing a safe work environment. Improving patient care. Complying with regulatory requirements. Infections can be spread through direct or indirect contact when infectious organisms enter the body or blood stream through the eyes, nose, mouth, or skin (cuts, punctures, rashes, wounds, or burns). Infections can also be spread through frequently touched items, instruments, and articles that come in contact with the patient and/or the environment. It is impossible to know who is infected and who is not, therefore it is important to follow Standard Precautions and consider ALL blood and body fluids from ALL persons as potentially infectious. Processes that reduce the risk for transmission: Standard Precautions Transmission-Based Precautions Standard Precautions are designed to protect the workforce member from bloodborne pathogens and prevent the transmission of infectious agents between the workforce member and patients. Standard Precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, non-intact skin, secretions, excretions (except sweat), and mucous membranes may contain infectious agents. Standard Precautions include: Hand hygiene (before and after every contact with a patient or their immediate environment) Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette Appropriate use of Personal Protective equipment (PPE) - gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection, depending on the anticipated exposure Preventing sharps injuries Safe injection practices Waste disposal Cleaning and disinfection Practicing good hand hygiene is the most important intervention in preventing the spread of infection. Hand washing utilizes water , soap and friction. Use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) consists consists of taking a small amount of the product, sufficient to cover both hands and all fingers, and rubbing the surface of your hands, including in between your fingers, fingertips, cuticles, wrist, and around your thumbs. Isopropyl Alcohol is used in a healthcare setting. INFECTION PREVENTION & CONTROL Wikipedia STANDARD PRECAUTIONS CDC recommends using ABHS with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol in a healthcare setting.NOTE: 92LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 93AmazonUSE ALCOHOL-BASED HAND SANITIZER Before starting your work on each unit Prior to going into and after leaving a patient room if your work involves touching the patient or any - thing in the room After touching objects that multiple people touch (i.e., telephones and door knobs, equipment, bed, etc.) After handling high-touch surfaces (i.e., telephones, door knobs, equipment, bed, etc.) or anything in the patient's immediate area Before leaving work Before touching a patient During patient care when moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site After contact with a patient's intact skin (e.g., when taking blood pressure, lifting a patient) Before donning (putting on) and after removing gloves (if gloves not visibly soiled with blood or body fluids HANDS MUST BE WASHED WITH SOAP AND WATER When hands are visibly soiled or contaminated After using alcohol-based hand sanitizer 5-10 times (per manufacturer 's guidelines) After contact with blood, body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, wound dressing or contaminated surfaces Before eating or preparing food After using the restroom After direct contact with a patient that is known or suspected to have Clostridium difficile (C. dif f), Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), or Norovirus, or any item/substance that may be contaminated with these pathogens Patients are encouraged to remind their healthcare providers to wash/clean their hands prior to providing care. Staf f should encourage patients to perform hand hygiene prior to meals and after using the toilet or commode.HAND HYGIENE PROPER STEPS ON PERFORMING HAND HYGIENE Using Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Washing Hands with Soap and Water 1.

If fingernail polish is worn, it must be in good condition, free of chips, and preferably clear in color. Hand jewelry with stones and crevices should not be worn as germs are difficult to remove from crev - ices and stones may tear gloves. Artificial fingernails are not permitted for those who have direct contact with patients (who touch the patient as part of their care or service), handle instruments or patient care equipment, supplies, food, specimens, or medications. \"Artificial fingernails\" is defined as any material applied to the fingernail for the purpose of strengthening or lengthening nails (e.g., tips, acrylic, gel, porcelain, silk, jewelry, overlays, wraps, fillers, superglue, any appliqu\u00e9s other than those made of nail polish, nail-piercing jewelry of any kind, etc.). ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES Do not eat, drink, apply cosmetics or lip balm or handle contact lenses in work areas where exposure may occur to infectious agents. Do not keep food or beverages in refrigerators, freezers or cabinets, on countertops or bench tops, or in any other area where they might be exposed to potentially infectious materials. Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette have been promoted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as strat - egies to contain Pathogen at the source and to limit their spread in areas where infectious patients might be awaiting medical care (such as in Emergency Department, Urgent Care, Clinics, Admitting areas, etc.). Patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of respiratory illness should be given a plain surgical mask and instructed to wear it if medically feasible, until communicable infection is ruled out or patient is placed on isolation precautions. Family members and other visitors exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory illness should be given and instructed to wear a plain surgical mask while in the facility. WFMs should observe Droplet Precautions and Standards Precautions when assisting or examining a patient with symptoms of a respiratory infection. INDIVIDUALS WITH SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF A RESPIRATORY INFECTION SHOULD: Cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. Use tissues to contain respiratory secretions and dispose of them in the nearest trash can after use. If you don't have a tissue, then cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or elbow , NOT your hands. Wash hands or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer/hand gel after having contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects/materials. MASKING AND SEPARATION OF PERSONS WITH RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS During periods of increased respiratory infection activity, offer masks to persons who are coughing. Masks are used to contain respiratory secretions. Encourage coughing patients to sit apart (at least six feet away , if possible) from others in common waiting areas.Prevent the spread of infection by washing your hands OR using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.REMEMBER RESPIRATORY HYGIENE/COUGH ETIQUETTE 94LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 95WORKFORCE MEMBERS: PRECAUTIONS TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO RESPIRATORY DROPLETS Workforce members should wear a medical-grade face mask for close contact with coughing patients, such as when examining a patient with symptoms of a respiratory infection, particularly if fever is present. Effective September 1, 2010, personnel performing procedures on a person who is a case or suspected case of an aerosol transmissible disease or on a specimen suspected of containing an Aerosol Transmissible Pathogen must wear a Powered Controlled Air Purifying Respirator (CAPR) , if potential for exposure is increased due to the anticipated generation of aerosolized pathogens. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, sputum induction, bronchoscopy, aerosolized administration of pentamidine or other medications, and pulmonary function testing. High Hazard Procedures also include, but are not limited to, autopsy, clinical, surgical and laboratory procedures that may aerosolize pathogens. The purpose of the PPE is to protect the workforce member (WFM) and patients from exposure to infectious agents; to be effective, PPE must be used correctly. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have produced technical specifications for PPE, which includes the following: Gloves Gown Mask or respirator Face shield or gogglesPERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) FA HEALTH Stop the spread of germs and keep others from getting sick.COVER YOUR COUGH Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash. You may be asked to wear a facemask to protect others.Wash hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or elbow. Don't sneeze into your hands.

Do not administer medications from the same syringe to multiple patients, even if the needle or cannula on the syringe is changed. Needles, cannulae and syringes are sterile, single-use items; they should not be reused for another patient or to access a medication or solution that might be used for a subsequent patient. Use fluid infusion and administration sets (e.g., intravenous bags, tubing and connectors) for one patient only and dispose appropriately after use. Consider a syringe or needle/cannula contaminated once it has been used to enter or connect to a patient' s intravenous infusion bag or administration set. Use single-dose vials for parenteral medications whenever possible. Do not administer medications from single-dose vials or ampules to multiple patients or combine leftover contents for later use. If multi-dose vials must be used, both the needle or cannula and syringe used to access the multi-dose vial must be sterile. Do not keep multi-dose vials in the immediate patient treatment area and store in accordance with the manufacturer 's recommendations; discard if sterility is compromised or questionable. Do not use bags or bottles of intravenous solution as a common source of supply for multiple patients. INFECTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS DURING BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING AND INSULIN ADMINISTRATION: Fingerstick devices should never be used for more than one person. Whenever possible, blood glucose meters should not be shared. If they must be shared, the device should be cleaned and disinfected after every use, per manufacturer's instructions. If the manufacturer does not specify how the device should be cleaned and disinfected, then it should not be shared. Insulin pens and other medication cartridges and syringes are for single-patient-use only and should never be used for more than one person. [Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), March 2008] Providers should NOT administer medications from the same syringe to more than one patient, even if the needle is changed. Additional protection is offered when medication vials can be dedicated to a single patient. It is important that: Medications packaged as single-use vials must never be used for more than one patient. Medications packaged as multi-use vials shall be assigned to a single patient whenever possible. Once punctured, the vial must be labeled with a beyond use date of 28 days or the manufacturer 's expiration date, whichever comes first, and disposed of by that date. Vaccines are exempt from the 28-day limit unless otherwise indicated by the manufacturer. Bags or bottles of intravenous solution must not be used as a common source of supply for more than one patient. Absolute adherence to proper infection control practices must be maintained during the preparation and administration of injected medications. Safe injection practices and sharps safety go hand in hand. By following safe injection practices to protect patients, health care providers also protect themselves. For example, the unsafe practice of syringe reuse also puts health care providers at risk of needlestick injury and potential bloodborne pathogen exposure. Once a needle and syringe are used on a patient, they should be discarded in a rigid, puncture-proof, leakproof sharps container .

For additional information contact: Your manager or supervisor Department of Infection Prevention and Control Employee Health Services Patient Care Equipment managed by patient care units or services must be cleaned with a hospital-approved detergent/ disinfectant and follow manufacturers' instructions for appropriate contact time. All disinfectants and cleaners must be approved by the hospital Infection Control Committee prior to use. It is the responsibility of each workforce member to know the appropriate contact/kill time for the product being used to disinfect surfaces or equipment. Only clean equipment is to be stored in the clean equipment area. Clean linens should be kept covered. Equipment must not be stored on or immediately around the sink to avoid contamination. All other equipment that is not cleaned or cannot be cleaned immediately after use shall be placed in the dirty equipment area or sent to Central Services. Only soiled equipment is stored in the soiled or \"dirty\" area and not in clean utility rooms. If it is unclear whether patient care equipment has been cleaned, it must be cleaned before patient use.CLEANING AND DISINFECTION Follow the guidelines for PDI wipe \"dwell/contact kill time\" Super Sani-Cloth 2 MINUTESREMIND - Sani-Cloth AF3 3 MINUTES OPTIM 1 Wipes 1 minute 101LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 102CLEANING, DISINFECTION, AND/OR STERILIZATION OF ENVIRONMENT AND PATIENT CARE EQUIPMENT: Cleaning: removal of visible soil and impurities (e.g., cleaning solutions). Low-Level Disinfection: elimination of most pathogenic microorganisms, except bacterial spores (e.g., disinfectant wipes). High-Level Disinfection: complete elimination of all microorganisms except bacterial spores (e.g., Trophon machine, Metricide, OPA, Automated Endoscope Reprocessing machine). Sterilization destroys or eliminates all forms of microbial life (e.g., autoclaving). CATEGORIZATION OF INSTRUMENTS/ITEMS ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF RISK FOR INFEC - TION ITEM DURING USE: Critical: Items used in sterile tissue or the vascular system that pose a high risk for infection if contaminated with any microorganism. Usually require sterilization. Examples : surgical instruments, cardiac or urinary catheters, implant, and ultrasound probes used in sterile body cavities. Semi-critical : Items that contact mucous membranes or non-intact skin. Minimally require high-level disinfection. Examples Ultrasound vaginal probes, cystoscopes, esophageal manometry probes, endoscopes, laryngoscopes, respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipment. Non-critical : Items that come in contact with intact skin but not mucous membranes. Usually require low-level disinfection. Examples: blood pressure cuffs, crutches, computers, gurneys, and wheelchairs. Computer hardware, especially keyboards, can be contaminated with microorganisms when touched by contaminated hands. Computer access without proper hand hygiene can deposit organisms on the keyboard. Transmission-Based Precautions prevent the transmission of a known infection between patients, healthcare personnel, and visitors. Transmission of infection within a health care setting requires three elements: Source of infectious microorganisms Susceptible host Means of transmission for the microorganisms from source to new host A variety of Infection Prevention and Control measures are necessary to reduce and prevent the transmission of microorganisms in the health care setting. These measures make up the fundamentals of Transmission-Based Precautions. When a patient is suspected or diagnosed of having an isolatable infection, he/she will be placed in the appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions. Workforce members entering the patient area are to follow posted instructions.INFECTION CONTROL FOR COMPUTERS DO 3Perform Hand Hygiene prior to using device. 3Clean and disinfect device regularly between users or when visibly soiled or contaminated with blood. 3Clean device before moving to another patient room. 3Remove devices from patient room following use; this includes isolation rooms. 3Keep computer at least 3 feet from sink.DO NOT 2Lay a device on a patient bed or any furnishings in the patient room. 2Place food or drinks on any mobile cart or in any wall unit. 2Use gloves during computer use. TRANSMISSION-BASED PRECAUTIONSTurboFuture 102LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 103GENERAL TRANSMISSION-BASED PRECAUTIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE TABLE BELOW: Transmission-Based PrecautionDescription Minimum PPE for Staff Contact Pathogens are transmitted by direct contact with an infected or colonized patient Transmission may also occur via indirect contact with contaminated environment Gloves Use additional PPE if indicated (e.g., gown) Droplet For pathogens transmitted by large respiratory drop - lets (>5 microns) that can be generated by a patient coughing, sneezing, or talking Some droplet-borne pathogens may also be trans - mitted by direct/indirect contact and will also require Contact Precautions Medical Mask Use additional PPE if indicated (e.g., gown, gloves, surgical mask) Patient wears a surgical mask when outside the room Airborne For pathogens transmitted by small airborne droplets (<5 microns) over long distances Some Airborne pathogens may also be transmitted by direct/indirect contact and will require a combi - nation of Airborne and Contact Precautions (i.e., COVID-19 when an aerosol-generating procedure is occurring) N95 Respirator (or) (PAPR) Controlled Air Respirator (CAPR) Use additional PPE if indicated (e.g., gown, gloves, face shield/goggles) Patient wears a medical-grade mask when outside the room Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms (MDROs) such as VRE, MRSA, C. difficile and Multi-Drug Resistant Gram Negative Organisms are common causes of health care-associated infections. Nearly all MDROs can be spread in the hospital or ambulatory health care setting via cross-transmission from colonized or infected patients or workforce members. The standard of care is to place all hospitalized patients with MDROs in Contact Precautions for the duration of the hospitalization. Note: If a patient is MRSA positive ONLY as a result of a nasal or groin screening culture (colonized), then the patient does NOT need to be placed into Contact Precautions. Exposure to Blood and Body Fluids If you are exposed to blood or body fluids, IMMEDIATELY : Wash the puncture site and cuts with soap and water. Rinse nose or mouth with clean water. Flush eyes with clean water/saline. Report the exposure to your supervisor. Complete the Bloodborne Pathogens Post Exposure Packet. Complete an Industrial Accident (IA) forms/packet. Go to Employee Health Services (EHS) or the Emergency Department (if EHS is closed) for follow-up. Submit a Safety Intelligence (SI) Report of exposure event. 103LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 104Hepatitis B vaccine is provided free of charge for DHS workforce members at risk of exposure to blood and body fluids per their job duties. Workforce members must have evidence of immunity to Varicella (Chickenpox) and MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) to work inside of a healthcare facility. Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) vaccines are recommended. Workforce members declining to accept a non-mandatory vaccination must complete a mandatory vaccination declination form. If the workforce member later decides to accept the vaccination, it will be provided to them. Non-County workforce members should obtain vaccinations from their physician or licensed health care professional; services provided through DHS will be billed to their contractor/agency as appropriate. SEASONAL INFLUENZA To comply with DHS Policy No. 334.200, as a condition of employment/assignment, an annual influenza vaccination is mandatory for every workforce member who works in a DHS facility unless the workforce member completes and signs an informed declination form. A sticker will be affixed to the DHS photo identification badge of workforce members who have received the influenza vaccination. Compliance with annual mandatory influenza vaccination shall be required by November 1st of each year. Influenza vaccination is available to all workforce members at no charge. All workforce members who have not been vaccinated by November 1st must wear a mask during the duration of the influenza season, regardless of submitting a signed declination, if they work in a health care area that provides patient care. If the workforce member later decides to accept the vaccination, it will be provided to them. COVID-19 All DHS staff with an e# or c# are eligible to receive the FDA-authorized vaccine for COVID-19 which is highly effective at preventing disease and hospitalizations. The vaccine is free of charge and available at one of the many employee vaccination clinics operating across the DHS network. Visit EHS database system to sign up. You can click through to view a visual How to Complete the COVID-19 Vaccine Request Form if you have any questions about how to sign up. The Cal-OSHA California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Chapter 4, Section 5199 requires that all healthcare settings adhere to an ATD Plan. An Aerosol Transmissible Disease (ATD) or Aerosol Transmissible Pathogen (ATP) is a disease or pathogen that is transmitted by aerosols, which requires either Droplet or Airborne Isolation. The complete list of Aerosol Transmissible Disease/ Pathogens which require Airborne or Droplet Isolation can be found in the Infection Control Policy Manual. EARLY IDENTIFICATION Efforts to identify suspected or confirmed ATD infectious patients will begin as soon as the patient enters the facility. Patients should be assessed for ATD symptoms when they enter the facility. If a cough or other symptoms are present, a surgical mask will be placed on the patient. Patient is to be placed in Airborne or Droplet Isolation during the time he/she is in the facility. WORKFORCE MEMBER PRECAUTIONS Workforce members are to wear a NIOSH approved N95 respirator mask for Airborne Isolation or a surgical mask for Droplet Isolation if the patient is coughing or unable to wear the mask.VACCINATIONS AEROSOL TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASE (ATD) / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 105TRANSPORTING PATIENTS Patients leaving the isolation room for urgent/necessary procedures must wear a surgical mask, be escorted by a healthcare worker, and the department or area must be notified prior to transporting the patient for any procedure or evaluation. EXPOSURES An \"ATD Exposure Incident\" is defined as an event in which a patient or employee sustains a substantial exposure to an ATD case without having had the benefit of all applicable and required control measures (i.e., respiratory protection, isolation, treatment). An employee who is exposed is to notify their supervisor as soon as possible (within 24 hours preferred). The supervisor who becomes aware of an exposure is to notify Employee Health and Infection Control and provide a list of employees suspected to have had an exposure. Exposed employees will be notified as soon as possible of potential exposures. A post-exposure evaluation will be conducted by Employee Health for those employees with a significant exposure. TB spreads through the air in droplets generated when a person with active TB coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are so small that regular air currents within a building can keep them airborne for hours. If you inhale these droplets, you can become infected with TB. When inhaled, the bacteria may become established in your lungs and spread throughout your body. TB is most commonly spread by close, prolonged, intense and unprotected contact indoors to an active TB patient. TB precautions include the following: Annual TB screening for all workforce members who work inside a healthcare facility. Early triage and identification of TB suspects. Isolation of suspect and confirmed TB patients. Proper engineering and maintenance of negative pressure TB isolation rooms (door is to be kept closed at all times). TB patient wears a barrier (surgical) mask when outside of isolation room and in enclosed area. Any workforce member providing direct patient care to respiratory isolation patients is to be fit tested and use an N95 respira - tor mask: In a TB patient's isolation room. During procedures that generate airborne secretions. When caring for suspected or confirmed TB patient(s). During vehicle transport of suspected or confirmed TB patients. Patients who have or are suspected of having TB should be placed in a negative pressure room where the air is vented to the outside. ACTIVE TB DISEASE This person can infect others unless he or she is taking the TB medicine as directed. Signs of illness are usually present and may include the following: Prolonged cough (2 or more weeks) Feel weak Have a fever Have weight loss Loss of appetite Night sweats Coughing up blood or have chest pain when coughing LATENT TB INFECTION (LTBI) This person carries the TB germ but does not look or feel sick and cannot infect others. If you have been told that you have LTBI and have not had prior treatment, it is strongly encouraged for you to complete treatment with a recommended regimen, including short-course treatments, unless a contraindication exists.TUBERCULOSIS (TB) 105LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 106Pandemic influenza usually arises from a novel or new virus strain that is dif ferent from commonly occurring seasonal influenza. Since there is little immunity, it can spread quickly and easily from person to person, potentially affecting millions of people. Therefore, information and guidelines in this handbook are based on generalities and may change depending on the novel strain. Once a novel virus is identified and a case definition is developed, it will be communicated by public health officials. CLINICAL INFORMATION Affects people of all ages. Typically, those at greatest risk of severe complications of influenza are infants, young children, elderly adults, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic disease although these risk groups may dif fer according to the circulating influenza strain. Incubation period and duration of viral shedding may vary depending on the novel strain. Symptoms may include fever, headache, extreme tiredness, dry cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Up to 30% of people with influenza have no symptoms, allowing transmission to others. A person can be infected and spread the virus before they become sick. TRANSMISSION Direct and indirect contact Transmission through coughing or sneezing (droplet > 5 micron in diameter) INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL Use of containment measures will be critical to reducing the spread of pandemic influenza. Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette Standard Precautions and use of personal protective equipment (for workforce members and patients) Droplet Precautions Guidelines may be amended as more is learned about the infectivity of the pandemic virus. Key Points about COVID-19 Prevention Tips: Avoid close contact with people who are: Sick COVID-19 positive or Person Under Investigation (PUI) with no evidence of symptoms (asymptomatic) Practice physical separation (social distancing) >6 feet apart from each other Wear your medical-grade face mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19 Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces Perform hand hygiene often with hand washing (soap/water) or ABHS ( see page 9 3).PANDEMIC INFLUENZA PLAN Seasonal influenza vaccine is available to you at Employee Health. WORKFORCE MEMBER GUIDANCE FOR COVID-19 106LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 107Definition of a Close Contact : A \"close contact\" is any of the following people who were exposed to an \"infected person\"* while they were infectious: An individual who was within 6 feet of the infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period. An individual who had unprotected contact with the infected person' s body fluids and/or secretions; for example, being coughed or sneezed on, sharing utensils or saliva, or providing care without wearing appropriate protective equipment. *An infected person is anyone with COVID-19, or who is suspected to have COVID-19, and considered to be infectious from 48 hours before their symptoms first appeared until they are no longer required to be isolated. A person with a positive COVID-19 test but no symptoms is considered infectious from 48 hours before their test was taken until 10 days after their test. Workforce Member Guidance for COVID-19 Self-Monitoring, Exposures and Work Restrictions It is important to monitor your health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms exhibited by the flu and or other respiratory illnesses and can include: Fever and/or Chills Cough Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Diarrhea Congestion or runny nose See references for further information Note : This list does not include all possible symptoms of COVID-19. Some people with COVID-19 never get symptoms. Seek COVID-19 Testing: If negative, WFM may return to work when they have been absent of fever for minimum of 24 hours without use of fever reducing medicine. The Department of Health Services (DHS) recommendations for COVID-19 include : If you are sick, you are required to stay home. If symptoms appear at work, immediately notify your supervisor and request to leave work, leave the patient care/work area and notify Employee Health Services (EHS). Click HERE for your local EHS contact information. Self-isolate at home and follow your healthcare provider's order and directions. If you test positive for COVID-19 outside of DHS you must report the results to Employee Health Services and your supervising manager within 24 hours or prior to coming to your next shift, whichever comes first. Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) is in place for your protection. All efforts are made to protect the privacy of all workforce members. All workforce members should self-monitor for symptoms consistent with COVID-19, including twice-daily temperature measurements for fever. If you are a WFM with a confirmed known high-risk exposure to a patient(s) with confirmed COVID-19, you will be evaluated by Employee Health Services. You may be required to home quarantine for 10 days. If a household member tests positive for COVID-19, then a risk assessment is needed by EHS to determine if the criteria for home quarantine is indicated for the employee based on the exposure. Note : Contact Patient Investigation for COVID-19 falls under each facility' s specific Policy and Procedure for Aerosol Transmissi - ble Disease Exposure Control Plan. When there is a possible exposure, Infection Prevention and Control (IP&C) performs an exposure analysis. This should be done within 48 hours of becoming aware of the potential exposure. Affected department(s) are identified by IP&C. Notification to these departments is done either by IP&C or Employee Health Services (EHS) per facility. Staff are instructed to present or call EHS for exposure evaluation. Employee Health Services will perform the exposure evaluation and, based on risk, determine if work restrictions are required. 107LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 108What else is DHS doing to assure a safe workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic? In accordance with AB 685, DHS is committed to maintaining a safe workplace for our employees, which includes prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and retaliation of any kind in accordance with state and federal laws. The department does not tolerate harassment or retaliation against any worker for disclosing a positive COVID-19 test result, diagnosis, exposure, or order to quarantine or isolate, for raising any related concerns, for filing for leaves, or for raising concerns about workplace safety or employee health. In addition, AB 685 requires timely notification of workforce members (WFMs) of workplace cases of COVID-19 and the steps that can be followed if the WFM spent time in the work area of the possible cases. An e-mail notification/blast will be sent out when there is a reported case and recipients will be advised of steps to be taken if they were in those work areas. Return to Work Guidelines Return to work guidelines have been developed with guidance from the Department of Health Services Infection Prevention and Control Medical Directors. Contact your local Employee Health Services for questions. If a workforce member has been off due to illness but has not been tested (we encourage the workforce member to get tested whenever possible), or tested negative for COVID-19, they can return to work when the following criteria have been met: They have been fever-free for at least 24 hours without use of fever-reducing medication; and Respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved; and Workforce member must continue to wear a medical-grade face mask while at work If a workforce member has tested positive for COVID-19 and was directed to care for themselves at home, they can return to work when the following criteria have been met: They have been fever-free for at least 24 hours without use of fever-reducing medication; and At least 10* days have passed since symptoms first appeared; and Other symptoms have improved; and Workforce member must continue to wear a medical-grade face mask while at work See the Workforce Member Guidance for COVID-19 for more information, such as guidelines for vaccinated individuals. *Note: at least 20 days have passed since symptoms first appeared for workforce members who are severely immuno - compromised (on chemotherapy for cancer, untreated HIV infection with CD4 lymphocyte count <200, combined primary immunodeficiency disorder and/or receipt of prednisone >20mg/day for more than 14 days). REMINDER : The Department of Health Services encourages you to review COVID-19 Expected Practices on an ongoing basis, as they may change during this COVID-19 Pandemic period. You may access the Expected Practices on the intranet . 108LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER (ALL STAFF) ALL STAFF (What a Joint Commission Surveyor Is Likely to Ask You About) LEADERSHIP Our mission, vision and values statements are included in various training programs. In addition to the definition of LAC+USC Medical Center's mission, vision and values contained in this handbook, the hospital makes available in a wallet-size format so that you can attach it to your Identification (ID) badge holder . All licensed medical professionals are expected to adhere to the highest ethical and professional standards of behavior and performance. If you observe behavior in a licensed professional that may compromise patient or environmental safety , you should report it to the appropriate office. It is important that you understand, whether you are a healthcare practitioner , technician, clerical or housekeeping member of our staff, that your job supports our organization's mission to provide fully-integrated, accessible, affordable and culturally competent care, one person at a time. THE JOINT COMMISSION ACCREDITATION Under The Joint Commission's Accreditation Participation Requirements, any workforce member who has concerns about the safety or quality of care provided in the organization may report those concerns to The Joint Commission. All surveys are unannounced, so it is important to maintain continuous preparedness. PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAM We have a proactive, multifaceted, and integrated Patient Safety Program. The goal of the Plan is to prevent adverse occurrences rather than just react to them. The Patient Safety Plan and Patient Safety Committee identify and investigate all recognized hazards to patient safety. You are responsible for performing your duties in a safe manner, protecting your own safety as well as the safety of the patients you serve. It is your responsibility to report any unexpected event, situation, environmental condition, or \"near miss\" that causes you to have concern for the safety of patients, visitors, or staf f as soon as possible. The Joint Commission annually establishes National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs) which LAC+USC Medical Center workforce members follow. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with the NPSGs that are applicable to your duties. LAC+USC Medical Center has instituted \"read back\" procedures to confirm the accuracy of orders issued over the telephone, verbal orders issued during an emergency or in the course of a procedure, and critical laboratory values/results reported either by telephone or verbally to a patient care provider . Use \"READ BACK\" procedures to ensure important information is accurately communicated and recorded. Before you administer medication to patients, identify the patient using two identifiers, Patient Name and MRUN number , per hospital policy. When it is not feasible to do a formal quote READ BACK for a verbal order (i.e. during a code blue), a REPEA T BACK is an acceptable means of confirming the accuracy of the order. Universal Protocol applies to all surgical and nonsurgical invasive procedures and establishes a process for preventing wrong site, wrong procedure and wrong person surgery. STAFF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES All LAC+USC Medical Center workforce members must complete all mandatory training and competency certification requirements for their respective positions [e.g., New Employee Orientation, Area/Unit Orientation, infection control, fire/life safety, emergency management, patient safety, CPR (if required) and other core competencies]. Workforce members are responsible for reporting any activity that appears to violate the Code of Conduct. DHS will not retaliate against anyone who reports a suspected violation in good faith. Compliance Awareness/Update training is provided to workforce members at the start of service. Compliance update training is provided annually. 109LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK The County of Los Angeles has established a \"zero tolerance policy\" for any conduct of a sexual nature that could possibly be interpreted as harassing, offensive or inappropriate in the workplace. It is the responsibility of the licensed professional to renew required professional credentials. Failure to comply with professional credential requirements may subject the person to corrective action, up to and including discharge/release from County service or release from a contracted assignment. Professional staff that must maintain a current professional credential to perform the duties will not be allowed to work with an expired professional credential. It is your responsibility to obtain a health screening annually. PATIENT RIGHTS AND SERVICES LAC+USC Medical Center Patients' Rights and Responsibilities are posted throughout the medical center for reference. Each patient is given a Welcome to the LAC+USC Medical Center (Patient Rights) handbook upon admission. Patients who are not formally admitted (i.e. via the emergency room) are provided a W elcome (Patient Rights) handbook by the Clinical Social Services Department. Patient Advocates are available for the LAC+USC Medical Center and can provide assistance to ensure that patient rights are protected. It is prohibited to use minors as interpreters in any situation. An Advance Health Care Directive (AHCD) is a legally recognized written document that allows a person to give orders regarding their health care decisions. The AHCD allows a person to give directives regarding their health care decisions, such as whether or not they want life-sustaining treatment should they become terminally ill or permanently unconscious. It also allows patients to name representatives and/or to state their desires about their health care, when they are unable to do so. LAC+USC Medical Center Clinical Social Services staff informs patients of their options concerning AHCD's. Patients can fill out an AHCD document or give oral direction to a physician, who will document the directive in the patient's medical record including completing appropriate documentation. If a patient or family member comes to you with a complaint about any aspect of medical care/treatment, refer them to the accountable supervisory staff to resolve the complaint at the first level whenever possible. RISK MANAGEMENT Sentinel even t: A patient safety event (not primarily related to the natural course of the [patient's] illness or underlying condition) that reaches a [patient] and results in death, severe harm (regardless of duration of harm), or permanent harm (regardless of severity of harm). Severe harm : An event or condition that reaches the individual, resulting in life-threatening bodily injury (including pain or disfigurement) that interferes with or results in loss of functional ability or quality of life that requires continual physiological monitoring or a surgery, invasive procedure, or treatment to resolve the condition. Permanent harm : An event or condition that reaches the individual, resulting in any level of harm that permanently alters and/or affects an individual's baseline. If you become aware of a sentinel event or a near miss, you must report it immediately . Report events in one of the following ways: Direct supervisor AND Safety Intelligence (SI) Event Reporting System OR Patient Care Statement of Concern OR contact: Hospital Risk Manager's Office at (323) 409-6657 Pharmacy to report Adverse Drug Events at (323) 409-8662 Medical Administration at (323) 409-6734 Patient Safety Officer at (323) 409-2797 KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER 110LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK KEY POINTS TO REMEMBERENVIRONMENT OF CARE Safety concerns must be reported to your supervisor and the Safety Officer. Completion of the Unsafe Conditions Report is also required. You can report safety concerns anonymously. Know what all emergency codes mean and how you should respond to each, for example at LAC+USC Medical Center: Code Blue means Adult Cardiac (or cardiopulmonary) Arrest Code White means Pediatric Cardiac (or cardiopulmonary) Arrest Code Red means Fire Emergency Code Gold means Behavior Response Team Code Gray mean Combative Person Code Silver means Person with a Weapon and/or Active Shooter and/or Hostage Situation Code Green means Patient Elopement Code Purple means Child Abduction Code Pink means Infant Abduction Code Orange means Hazardous Material Spill/Radiation Incident Code Yellow means Bomb Threat Code Rapid Response means Urgent Medical Attention is needed for Inpatients Code Assist means Urgent Medical Assistance is needed for Outpatients, Visitors, and Staff Code Triage Alert means Potential Disaster Situation Code Triage Internal means Internal Disaster Situation Code Triage External means External Disaster Situation The Safety Data Sheet (SDS) tells what hazards a chemical presents and how to handle spills/exposures. You must know the names of the hazardous materials that you work with and that you may come into contact with in your area. You should know the location of the SDS sheets in your work area. If you don't know where they are kept, ask your supervisor. The SDS manual is also located in the hospital's 24/7 Nursing Office and the Safety Office. In the event of a fire, follow the SAFE and the PASS procedures, as appropriate. You must know where the fire alarm, fire extinguisher, fire box and fire evacuation route for your work area are located. If you are unable to find them, check with your supervisor. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL Practicing good hand hygiene is the most important thing you can do to prevent the spread of infection. You must wash your hands before and after direct patient contact, after removing gloves, before/after eating, drinking, smoking, after using the toilet, whenever there is any doubt about contamination, and when hands are visibly soiled. You can use alcohol-based hand sanitizer before direct contact with patients, after contact with a patient's intact skin, after contact with inanimate objects in a patient's area, after removing gloves (not visibly soiled with blood or bodily fluids), and before leaving work. Use gloves before contact with mucous membranes, open skin, blood/body fluids, or the handling of contaminated substances or surfaces. Always change your gloves between patients. Glove use does not substitute for hand washing. In the event of a sudden influx of a large number of infectious patients, LAC+USC Medical Center will implement the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS). A full description of HICS can be found in the disaster manual; all departments have copies of the disaster manual. PRIVACY OF PATIENT INFORMATION (HIPAA) Protecting Patients' Rights to Personal Privacy Protect the privacy of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as well as Protected Health Information (PHI). Only use your dhs.lacounty.gov e-mail to send patient information and obtain permission to encrypt e-mails to be sent outside the DHS e-mail domain. When conducting a conversation regarding a patient, do so in a private place or speak quietly to minimize the possibility of being overheard. Keep medical records and other documents that contain PHI out of public view . If a patient requests a restriction regarding sharing information about them such as diagnosis and/or treatment with family and/or others, document the request and make sure the treatment team is aware of the request. Make sure all documents belong to the patient and use the two identifier process before providing patients with documents such as appointment reminders, discharge summaries, and eligibility packets. 111LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER Treat confidential information as if it were your own. Report suspected HIPAA violations by means of an entry in the Safety Intelligence (SI) Event Reporting System AND by phone to the facility Privacy Manager at (323) 409-6100. It is the responsibility of every member of our service delivery team to maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy and confidentiality of our patients' PHI. The Privacy Rule applies to PHI in all forms including electronic, written, oral, and any other form. Unless otherwise authorized by the patient, PHI may only be used and/or disclosed for purposes of treatment, payment, and healthcare operations (TPO). Personally Identifiable Information (PII), information similar to PHI, must be protected. LAC+USC Medical Center uses the following safeguards to protect patient-specific information: Requires Compliance Awareness training for all staff within 30 days of hire/assignment. Use shredders and locked bins to dispose of PHI documents. Cover carts used to transport medical records. Implement a need to know level of security to access PHI. If you access or disclose patient information that is not related to your job or that does not have the patient' s authorization, you are in violation of DHS policy, HIPAA and State law and may be subject to monetary fines, civil or criminal penalties, or corrective action including discharge from County service or assignment.

All healthcare workers, whose reasonably anticipated duties may result in exposure to blood borne pathogens, must practice Standard Precautions. Blood-borne pathogens may be acquired through open skin (cut, puncture, rash, wound, burn) or through mucous membrane exposure (splash to eyes, nose, mouth). It is impossible for you to know who is or is not infected. Therefore, consider ALL blood, body fluids or substances from ALL persons as potentially infectious. Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be used when there is likelihood for blood or body fluid exposure (splashing). PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) Gloves Gown Protective eyewear or face shield Mask BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS Some of the blood-borne diseases to which you can be exposed include: Hepatitis C Hepatitis B Hepatitis D Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Syphilis Effective April 1, 2010 - State requires acute care facilities to report Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI) through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

HOB elevated minimum 30 degrees Peptic Ulcer Disease Prophylaxis Deep Venous Thrombosis Prophylaxis MULTI DRUG RESISTANT ORGANISMS (MDROS) A Multi Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO) is a strain of bacteria that is resistant to common antibiotics used to treat infections. Infections can vary, depending on the organism. MDROs can cause skin infections (boils, abscesses), urinary tract infections, blood stream infections, and pneumonia, and they can infect wounds, the respiratory tract and surgical sites. Prevention Strategies for Reducing the Incidence and Risk of MDROs Follow hand hygiene policy. Ensure proper cleaning and disinfection of equipment and the environment. Use contact precautions for patients with MDROs. 116LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION AUREUS (MRSA) Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), or Oxacillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (ORSA), is an antibiotic resistant type of bacteria that can cause skin, blood, surgical site, urinary , and respiratory infections. Prevention strategies for reducing the incidence and risk of MRSA infections Follow hand hygiene policy. Use contact precautions for MRSA colonized or infected patients. Educate patients and their families about MRSA and how to prevent its spread. Ensure proper cleaning and disinfection of equipment and the environment. MRSA Screening Protocol All patients admitted to the hospital must be screened for MRSA if they are: Scheduled for inpatient surgery, Previously discharged from a hospital within the last 30 days, Being admitted to the intensive care unit, Receiving dialysis, and Transferred from a Skilled Nursing Facility. The patient must be provided with MRSA education. In addition, the physician responsible for patient's medical care must inform the patient or the patient's representative or positive MRSA screen. It's the law! VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT ENTEROCOCCI (VRE) Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) is a type of bacteria normally found in the intestines and female genital tract that is resistant to Vancomycin. VRE can cause infections of the urinary tract, the bloodstream, or of wounds. VRE occurs more frequently in patients who have been previously treated with Vancomycin or other antibiotics for long periods of time, are hospitalized, have weakened immune systems, have undergone surgical procedures of the abdomen or chest, or have long term urinary or central line catheters. BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS 117LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKThis section addresses general patient care principles related to population-specific guidelines, pain assessment/reassessment, and nutrition services. Staff with direct patient care responsibilities is trained in working with the appropriate age groups (neonate, infant, child, adolescent, adult and geriatric patients) during the initial area/unit and job-specific orientation. Staf f who interact with patients as part of their job must develop skills and competencies for delivering appropriate population-specific communications, care, and interventions to assure each patient's unique needs are met. People grow and develop in stages that are related to their age and share certain qualities at each stage. By adhering to the following guidelines, a sense of trust and rapport with patients can be established and psychological, social and physical needs of patients can be met. The population-specific guidelines are: NEONATES (BIRTH TO 28 DAYS) Neonates are newborns. Keep in flexed position, with knees to chest and arms midline, when possible. Use warm hands, equipment, and room. Allow rest periods between procedures and treatments. Provide security and ensure a safe environment. Involve the parent(s) in care. Limit the number of strangers around the neonate. Ensure crib/gurney rails are up and incubator doors are closed. Use equipment and supplies specific to the age and size of the neonate. INFANTS (1 MONTH TO 12 MONTHS) Rock, swaddle, and sing softly to infant. Use a distraction (e.g., brightly colored toys, hand puppets). Keep the parent(s) in the infant's line of vision. Ensure crib/gurney rails are up at all times. Use equipment and supplies specific to the age and size of infant. CHILDREN (1 YEAR TO 12 YEARS) Includes the toddler (ages 1-3), pre-school (ages 3-5), and school-age child (ages 6-12). Use simple, concrete terms when talking to younger children. Allow younger children to keep security object (e.g., blanket, toy), if possible. Give praise, rewards, and clear rules. Encourage older children to ask questions. Use toys and games to teach the child and reduce fears. Always explain what you will do before you start; be age appropriate in language used/choice of words. Involve older children in care and offer choices whenever possible. Provide for the safety of the child. Do not leave the child unattended. Use equipment and supplies specific to the age and size of the child. ADOLESCENTS (13 YEARS THROUGH 17 YEARS) Treat the adolescent more as an adult than a child. Avoid authoritarian approach and show respect. Explain procedures using simple terms and correct terminology to adolescents and parents. Consider the importance of the adolescents' peer group. Provide for privacy. ADULTS (18 YEARS THROUGH 64 YEARS) Be supportive and honest. Respect the patient's personal values. PATIENT CARE PRACTICES POPULATION-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES AND CARE OF SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS PATIENT CARE PRACTICES 118LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK Support the person in making health care decisions. Recognize commitments to family, career, and community. Address age-related changes. GERIATRICS (65 YEARS & OLDER) Avoid making assumptions about loss of abilities, but anticipate the following: Short term memory loss. Decline in the speed of learning and retention. Loss of ability to discriminate sounds. Decreased visual acuity. Slowed cognitive function (understanding). Decreased heat regulation of the body. Inability to chew food properly. Provide support for coping with any impairment. Prevent isolation; promote physical, mental, and social activity . Provide information to promote safety. PATIENT CARE PRACTICESPAIN ASSESSMENT AND REASSESSMENT Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale From Wong DL, Hockenberry-Eaton M, Wilson D, Winkelstein ML, Schwartz P: Wong's Essentials of Pediatric Nursing, 6/e, St. Louis, 2001, P. 1301. Copyrighted by Mosby, Inc. Reprinted by permission. Pain is a common experience for a majority of our patients. LAC+USC Medical Center supports every patient's right to have his/ her pain assessed and treated promptly, effectively, and for as long as the pain persists. Health care providers assess all patients receiving care at our facility for pain upon initial presentation and in subsequent reassessments as indicated. On initial complaint of pain, a comprehensive assessment is performed. LAC+USC Medical Center uses an appropriate pain assessment tool to assess, reassess, and document pain ratings so that we can compare these ratings over time. Pain is a very subjective experience. Because the patient is the best judge of the intensity of his/her pain and the effectiveness of its treatment, most of the assessment tools we use at LAC+USC Medical Center depend on information from the patient's self- report. However, when a patient cannot self-report, we use tools that allow pain assessment based on physiologic changes and/ or behavioral indicators to rate the severity of the patient's pain experience. On a scale of zero (0) to 10, with zero (0) being the absence of pain, the following severity levels apply: Mild Pain 1 - 3 Moderate Pain 4 - 6 Severe Pain 7 - 10 119LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK PATIENT CARE PRACTICESFLACC SCALE The FLACC Pain Scale can be used for scoring pain in (a) children up to 5 years of age, (b) patients who are developmentally delayed, (c) children who have difficulty understanding a FRS and/or F ACES Pain Scale who are greater than 5 years of age, and (d) patients who may not be able to verbalize the presence/severity of pain or non-communicative.

The patient is reassessed for the effectiveness of the intervention/treatment and the pain score or physiological and/or behavior signs of pain are document within one hour in the reason column of the Medication Administration Record (MAR) for inpatients or Clinic Record/Progress Note for outpatients. Effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of the treatment is documented by the nurse or physician. If the pain is not relieved, then the next intervention or treatment plan is initiated and documented until the pain can be controlled. Our approach to pain management includes the use of pharmacologic as well as non-pharmacologic interventions. W e educate our patients and families about their right to have their pain assessed and treated and give patients the \"Management of Your Pain\" brochure. We also tell them the purpose for the frequent reassessments and the use of the pain rating scales. Palliative Care focuses on the comfort and well-being of patients, in particular those with incurable, progressive illnesses. It is a team approach to comprehensive management of physical, social, spiritual, and psychological needs of patients and their families. The goal is to achieve the best possible quality of life through relief of suf fering and control of symptoms. Reasons to ask for a consult: Team/ patient/ family needs help with complex decision making. Code status discussions. Goals of care clarification. Unacceptable symptom distress (i.e. pain, dyspnea, nausea, etc.). Provide information and resources to patients/ family.

PAIN HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM Assess : Primary areas of pain Patient's ranking of types of pain where pain #1 is the most bothersome, pain #2 is the next most bothersome, etc. Quality of pain This demonstrates to patients that we prioritize their most bothersome regions of pain and that we are targeting their therapy for maximum effectiveness and minimum risk. Examine : Skin, wounds (if any), and other anatomy of the area(s) the patient describes experiencing pain Physical exam both informs the assessment of pain and demonstrates to patients that we are committed to a comprehensive evaluation of their pain. GOALS FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT Elicit from the patient what their functional goals are. The goal of pain management is to avoid iatrogenic harm while optimizing pain control. Share patient goals to maximize function, participate in therapeutic activities such as physical therapy , community engagement, and quality of life. Once a patient's functional goals are identified, determine how pain treatment advances the patient toward achieving these goals. Adjust treatments that do not improve patient functional goals. THREE MAJOR TYPES OF PAIN Nociceptive pain is typically from incisions, fractures, or physical injury like strain or inflammation. This includes muscle pain (myofascial tenderness on palpation), joint pain (pain with weight bearing or joint loading, morning stif fness), etc. Neuropathic pain can be from any insult to the nervous system: nerves that are cut, pinched, irritated, or otherwise traumatized, or physiologic insults like brain injury, stroke, or diseases like multiple sclerosis. Quality is typically burning, shooting, tingling, numbness, pins and needles (paresthesias), allodynia, and hypersensitivity . Centralized pain pain is typically from an insult to the central nervous system (brain or spinal cord injury , significant mental illness like severe depression, anxiety, or PTSD). It's important to have behavioral health expert collaboration to work on pain/stress coping strategies like distraction or deep breathing, recognizing pain triggers, cognitive behavioral therapy , etc. Complex chronic pain may include multiple of these pathways. One may start as acute nociceptive pain and develop into chronic centralized pain. It is not uncommon for patients with significant dysfunction with complex chronic pain to overlap with depression, insomnia, PTSD, anxiety and substance- use disorders. Address these co-occurring issues comprehensively, along with aggressive pain management, for optimal improvement in patients' health.LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK124TREATMENT PLANNING A multi-modal approach that includes medications, physical therapy and other modalities, and minimally invasive interventions should be considered for acute pain conditions. A multidisciplinary approach for chronic pain across various disciplines, utilizing one or more treatment modalities improves outcomes. Patients with chronic pain that is poorly responsive to standard treatments should be assessed for undiagnosed or undertreated behavioral health issues including substance use disorder . Treatment includes the following five broad treatment categories: Restorative Therapies Interventional procedures Behavioral health approaches Complementary and integrative health Medications RESTORATIVE THERAPIES E-Consult: Physical Therapy E-Consult: Occupational Therapy E-Consult: The Wellness Center Indoor and outdoor physical activities including fitness trails, jogging paths, exercise areas and fitness equipment are available. INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES E-Consult: Pain Procedures E-Consult: Pain Management (non-malignant) for questions about which approaches might be appropriate for your patient BEHAVIORAL HEALTH APPROACHES Order: Specialty Referral to Social Work to refer the patient for a behavioral health assessment E-Consult: Addiction Medicine for support of assessment and diagnosis of substance use disorders DHS Addiction Medicine Consult line 8am to Midnight everyday including weekends: (213) 288-9090 E-Consult: Mental Health for psychiatric consultation COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH E-Consult: The Wellness Center Acupuncture, massage, movement therapies (such as yoga and tai chi) are available MEDICATION MANAGEMENT: Topicals : Always offer wherever feasible. Lidocaine cream or patches are available OTC at 4% strength (Salonpas, Aspercreme for example), or Rx strength is 5%. Apply 3-4g to painful areas QID - numbing, helpful for both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Voltaren gel (Diclofenac) 1% is available OTC or Rx. Apply 3-4g to painful areas TID if taking oral NSAIDs too, or QID if no oral NSAIDs- anti-inflammatory, helpful primarily for nociceptive pain. Oral non-opioid analgesics : If no hepatic failure, Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is safe and effective. Typically most patients tolerate 1000mg TID standing or PRN. Limit to maximum 2,000mg daily for hepatic insufficiency. renal insufficiency contraindication, Ibuprofen 600-800mg TID with food PRN is helpful for nociceptive pain. If there is history of GERD/stomach irritation, consider instead Meloxicam 7.5mg BID with food PRN or even Celecoxib (Celebrex) 100mg BID with food PRN. PATIENT CARE PRACTICES 124LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK125If there is significant objective muscle tightness or myofascial pain, muscle relaxants can be considered. Muscle relaxants do cause drowsiness, increase fall risk, and potentiate other sedatives including alcohol. Caution in starting these medications and monitor closely. These medications should be avoided in the elderly or patients with polypharmacy. Recommend starting with low dose just at bedtime at first to assess for side effects. Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) 5-10mg QHS to start may help with sleep initiation. If tolerated (watch for drowsiness, dizziness), can increase to 5-10mg TID PRN. This is serotonergic, so caution if patient is on more than two serotonergic agents for risk of serotonin syndrome. Methocarbamol (Robaxin) 500-1000mg TID PRN is usually well tolerated, tends to cause less drowsiness, can be up-titrated to maximum PRN (watch if patient has HTN). Baclofen 5-10mg TID PRN - usually first line for spasticity associated with central nervous system injury, can also be helpful for neuropathic pain. Neuropathic analgesics : For neuropathic pain, and even nociceptive pain as a strategy to minimize opioid requirements, the first-line neuropathic analgesic is gabapentin. Note: Gabapentin not available in Correctional Health Services formulary . Gabapentin is usually started at 300mg QHS x 3-7 days to assess for side ef fects (can cause drowsiness/dizziness), then increased to 300mg BID x 3-7 days, then increased to first goal dose of 300mg TID. If this causes a lot of drowsiness but is helpful, increase the nighttime dose to goal dose of 900mg QHS only. As tolerated, can increase in a similar fashion to 600mg TID, which maximizes gabapentin's bioavailability. If creatinine clearance is mL/min, recommend BID dosing up to goal dose 600mg BID. Maximum safe dose is 3600mg/24 hours (1200mg TID) but usually past 800mg TID there is limited benefit to dose increases. The second-line neuropathics of choice are duloxetine (Cymbalta) and nortriptyline (Pamelor) , and they can be helpful for mood too. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) can be started at 20-30mg daily x 3 days then uptitrate as tolerated to 20-30mg BID (max dose for neuropathic pain). This medication does not tend to cause drowsiness but can cause GI upset or dizziness. This is serotoner - gic, so caution if patient is already on multiple serotonergic medications. Alternatively, nortriptyline (Pamelor) is usually started at 10mg QHS, then after 7 days to assess for ef fectiveness or side effects, can uptitrate to 20mg QHS as first goal dose. Caution for drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, confusion, bladder reten - tion. Can continue to uptitrate to lowest effective dose, max safe dose is 150mg/24 hours. This is serotonergic, so caution if patient is already on multiple serotonergic meds. Nortriptyline tends to have fewer side effects than amitriptyline (Elavil) , though amitriptyline has more evidence for efficacy in neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury. These medications should be avoided in the elderly > 65 years old. If a patient has had no effectiveness with maximum dose gabapentin, a second-line neuropathic, AND a muscle relaxant, (or can't try some of these because of allergies or other contraindication) then insurance companies will consider covering pregabalin (Lyrica) , which requires prior authorization. Pregabalin (Lyrica) typically works best in patients with complex neuropathic pain like after spinal cord injury or phantom limb pain after amputation. If starting pregabalin, wean gabapentin to at least half their previous dose, then start L yrica at about 50-100mg BID. Caution for drowsiness, leg swelling. After 3 days, as tolerated, can stop gabapentin and increase pregabalin to max dose 600mg/day (so 200mg TID or 300mg BID). An \"out of the box\" third-line analgesic that has most benefit in complex neuropathic or centralized pain and/or depression is ket - amine. Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that can be helpful in depression and complex chronic pain, but it is primarily used in the peri-operative setting as an adjunct to anesthesia. It can be used in the outpatient setting, but compounded capsules are not covered by insurance and there are very few ketamine infusion programs that accept insurance. PATIENT CARE PRACTICES 125LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK126SLEEP AIDS Melatonin 3-6mg qhs is a natural sleep aid that can help facilitate sleep quality/duration with minimal side effects. Trazodone 50-100mg qhs is a sleep aid. It can cause orthostasis, particularly in the elderly. It can also cause priapism in men. If melatonin and trazodone are contraindicated or ineffective, diphenhydramine (Benadryl 25-50mg) is also a common sleep aid, though can cause anticholinergic symptoms including cognitive problems especially in the elderly. Can also use other anti-histamines like hydroxyzine or even cyproheptadine. Cyproheptadine is also a serotonin blocker used for the treatment of serotonin syndrome. Nortriptyline (Pamelor) and amitriptyline (Elavil) are commonly dosed at night and can be helpful for neuropathic pain, mood, and sleep. If someone has a lot of drowsiness on gabapentin or pregabalin , it's recommended to keep the daytime doses low BID and then just increase the night time dose, which can help with zaleplon) have been used as short term sleep aids and benzodiazepines have been used for brief episodic anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasticity management. They generate physical dependence, and are dangerous in combination with other sedating medications. They are not recommended for long term use for any condition and increase risk of death when combined with opioids and other central nervous system depressants. OPIOIDS and OPIOID SAFETY Opioids can be appropriate for acute trauma or pain (e.g. motor-vehicle accident, sickle cell crisis), acute post-operative pain, and pain from terminal illness such as malignancies. Aside from terminal pain, all patients should be counseled that they should not need opioids after the expected healing period (usually 3-10 days and generally not more than 14 days). After that, the risks of opioids almost always outweigh the benefits. Opioids are not indicated for chronic (longer than 3 months), non-terminal pain. Opioids shut down the pain-signaling pathway, and after their effects wear off, the pain returns because opioids do not address cause of pain. Opioids can also trigger the pain system to become more sensitive - a condition known as opioid induced hyperalgesia. DHS expected practices are to not offer treatments when harm outweighs benefit. Explain to patients opioid-associated risks including increased risk of death, overdose, dependence and hyperalgesia, and interference with other pain management treatments. Non-opioid treatments are safer and better address the inflammation and nerve irritation that are physiologic causes of pain. Structured & validated opioid risk tools exist such as the OR T: https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/ opioidrisktool.pdf For high-risk situations (active concurrent substance use disorders, history of overdose on prescribed opioids, diversion behavior , and respiratory insufficiency), there is no benefit that would outweigh the harm of continuing opioids. Transition these patients to buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone) as their opioid analgesic strategy of choice. Buprenorphine is a schedule III opioid partial agonist that is categorically safer than all other opioids. It has analgesic properties and thus a wide therapeutic index for pain management. Usual dosing for analgesia is buprenorphine-naloxone 2-0.5mg to 8mg-2mg tablet SL TID. Risk factors for problems related to opioid use include: Chronic disease: risk of opioid use disorder is 30% History of mental health issues: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, suicidal behaviors Social instability and trauma such as history of sexual abuse Personal history of substance use (including alcohol, tobacco use, illicit drugs, and prescriptions), any history of overdose Risk factors for over sedation such as concomitant sedatives, benzodiazepine use, taking > 50 MME/day Family history of substance abuse (including alcohol, illicit drugs, and prescriptions) Risk factors associated with decreased respiratory function such as obesity , COPD, asthma, OSA Risk factors associated with poor metabolic clearance such as advanced age, liver or kidney disease Structured & validated opioid risk tools exist such as the ORT: https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/opioidrisktool.pdf PATIENT CARE PRACTICES 126LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK127 Safer opioid strategies in chronic pain management: Avoid opioids for chronic non-terminal pain. Practice naloxone (Narcan) co-prescribing and education (indications for use, calling 91 1, administer second dose if effects wane). For patients already on opioids, we recommend evaluation for tapering the opioid dose down or discontinuous opioids at each visit. Evaluate all patients on chronic opioids for opioid misuse and/or diversion. Set a brief time-limited goal for use of opioids, with specific evaluation of functional improvements. If there is no improvement of functional goals on opioids, stop the opioids. Use lowest effective dose. The maximum recommended daily opioid dose is 50 MME (e.g. Oxycodone 40mg/day). If choosing to prescribe opioids for chronic pain, consider abbreviated prescriptions e.g. 3-7 days for new acute pain. Implement safeguards such as random urine drug screens (UDS) to ensure compliance both that patient is taking prescribed opioid and not taking illicit medications. Note urine fentanyl test is a unique order . Practice naloxone (Narcan) co-prescribing and education (indications for use, calling 911, administer second dose if effects wane). Minimize risky combinations, avoid co-prescription of benzodiazepines and other potentially sedating medications. CURES report checks: use first 1-3 letters of first and last names plus date of birth to capture all versions of patients' names. For high-risk situations (active concurrent substance use disorders, history of overdose on prescribed opioids, diversion behavior, and respiratory insufficiency), there is no benefit that would outweigh the harm of continuing opioids. Transition these patients to buprenorphine-nalox one (Suboxone) as their opioid analgesic strategy of choice. Buprenorphine is a schedule III opioid partial agonist that is categorically safer than all other opioids. It has analgesic properties and thus a wide therapeutic index for pain management. Some providers find that Pain Treatment Agreements can facilitate difficult conversations and preserve a therapeutic relationship between patient and care team. There is no evidence to support the outcome based clinical benefit of Pain Treatment Agreements (Controlled Substance Prescription/Opioid Contracts). Consult Pain Management for advice, education, and support: eConsult to Pain Management (non-malignant) for patients in ambulatory settings. Tapering Opioids It is easier to taper down long acting opioids (such as methadone or morphine OR) on a patient' s regimen first and subsequently transition to short acting opioids as an initial milestone. Long acting opioids such as methadone, oxycodone extended release, and morphine sulfate extended release are generally only appropriate for patients with terminal pain. Reduce the daily dose by 10-20% each week to month to minimize physical withdrawal and psychological anxiety about changes in opioids. Individualize the pace of tapering. Encourage splitting tabs in half and replacing breakthrough opioid doses with breakthrough non-opioid strategies. For further guidance on tapering, please see \" Addiction Medicine and Pain Medicine - Opioid Taper \". Send an eConsult to Pain Management (non-malignant) if there are specific questions about tapering opioids. PATIENT CARE PRACTICESFreepik 127LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK128PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Opioid use disorder commonly co-occurs with chronic pain. If a patient has an opioid use disorder , the first line treatment is to initiate sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone, which can be dosed TID to QID to address pain. Instructions for initiating buprenorphine/naloxone are discussed in the Addiction Medicine - Medication Management of Opioid Use Disorder in Ambulatory Care Settings . An X-waiver is not required to prescribe buprenorphine-naloxone for the indication of pain. Ensure that the indication of pain is documented in the ORCHID order in the instructions for the pharmacist field to clarify the indication for this buprenorphine-naloxone. An X-waiver is required to prescribe buprenorphine-/naloxone in ambulatory settings for the indication of opioid use disorder . Email buprenorphine@dhs.lacounty.gov to obtain an X-waiver. Providers who prescribe buprenorphine-naloxone for the indication of opioid use disorder must include their X-waiver number, the diagnosis of opioid use disorder (F11.20) in the ORCHID order in the instructions for the pharmacist field. For patients with alcohol, tobacco, and other co-occurring substance use disorders, see the DHS Clinical Care Library section on Addiction Medicine to review and implement DHS expected practices related to the treatment of these conditions: http://lacounty.sharepoint.com/sites/dhs-ccl/Addiction%20Medicine/Forms/AllItems.aspx If there are non-urgent questions about appropriate use of medications for alcohol, tobacco, and/or opioid use disorder , use the eConsult: Addiction Medicine - Medications for Addiction Treatment.

NUTRITION CONSULTS Registered Dietitians are available for consultation between the hours of 7:30 a.m. - 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekends and holidays. A written consult order or referral, which may include reason for consult or referral, is required for each patient. The Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Service (PENS) nursing staff is available for consultation on Home Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) and procurement of Dobhoff tubes. DIET ORDERS A written diet order, which may include NPO or a specialized nutrition regimen, is required for each patient. A change in the diet order written on physician's order form will automatically cancel all previous diet orders written. Patient meal service includes meal delivery and hospitality services, operated by Morrison Healthcare Food Service, Inc. Each meal is delivered accord to the time schedule (see table below). Changes to patient's diet order must be entered into ORCHID. In order to have the patient's meal delivered automatically, the patient's diet order must be entered into ORCHID prior to specific electronic ordering cut-off times (see table below). Diet orders that are entered into ORCHID after a given electronic ordering cut-off time, must be communicated to a diet clerk via telephone. These late requests will be delivered by Food & Nutrition personnel up until the delivery cut-off times (see table below). Telephone meal tray requests that are made after a given delivery cut-off time must be retrieved from the Food & Nutrition department (IPT Main Kitchen) by the requestor. Nourishments (between meals snacks) may be ordered for any patient within the diet prescribed and are delivered at 10:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 8:00 p.m. daily . MEAL MEAL TIMEELECTRONIC ORDERING CUT-OFF TIMEDELIVERY PATIENT CARE 129LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKThis section addresses general patient care principles related to patient safety including \"Read Back\" requirements, responding to the decline in patient condition, fall reduction, Universal Protocol, medication management, unapproved abbreviations, behavioral restraints, medical record requirements for physicians/Licensed Independent Practitioners (LIP), and medical review checklist. In an effort to improve communication among care providers, LAC+USC Medical Center has several processes in place to confirm the accuracy of orders issued over the telephone for urgent/emergent situations, verbal orders issued during an emergency or in the course of a procedure, and critical test results reported either by telephone or verbally to a patient care provider . Telephone Orders - While the licensed independent provider (NP, PA, MD) issues the order, the registered nurse (RN) enters the telephone order into the electronic health record. Before ending the telephone call, the RN \"reads back\" the order to the provider to confirm that he/she understood and transcribed it correctly . The RN will document the phrase \"Telephone Order issued by\" or the abbreviation \"T.O. by\" followed by the provider's printed full name and provider identification number. The electronic telephone order will be automatically routed to the issuing provider , to be signed as soon as possible, and no more than 48 hours later. Verbal Orders - It is not always feasible to do a formal \"read back\" for a verbal order (e.g., during a code blue or in surgery). In such circumstances, a \"repeat back\" is an acceptable means of confirming the accuracy of the order . When able, the RN will enter the verbal order into the electronic medical record. The order must include the date, time, specific order, ordering provider's name and the communication type selected as \"Verbal with Read Back.\" The electronic verbal order will be automatically routed to the issuing provider, to be signed as soon as possible, and no more than 48 hours later. Critical Laboratory Values/Results - LAC+USC Medical Center communicates the Critical Laboratory V alues/Results in a timely manner to the physician providing care for the patient. The medical center laboratory will relay all Critical Laboratory Values/Results for adult patients to the Customer Service Center from 7:01 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. (0701-2300 hour) except lab results originating from the Department of Emergency Medicine Intensive Care Units, Pediatrics, Employee Health, and Operating Rooms. For all other areas and the critical laboratory values from 1 1:01 p.m. to 6:59 a.m. (2301-0659 hour), the performing laboratory staff will handle notification per LAC+USC Medical Center Policy No. 911. When a Critical Laboratory Value/Result is called, the physician/designee or the customer service workforce member who accepts the critical test result is asked to do a verification \"read back\". As patient caregivers, you need to know the signs and symptoms of the decline in a patient' s condition, within your scope of practice. The assessment and recognition of the deteriorating patient is an ongoing challenge throughout the patient's stay or visit to your facility. Every patient is unique, so recognizing changes can be different from one patient to the next. Baseline assessment of health condition, on-going health assessments, handof f communication reports, chart documentation and other communication modalities are good methods to use in recognizing declination in the patient' s condition. Every member of the healthcare team is responsible to ensure that he/she gives the highest level of care, and to immediately react upon emergencies, potential emergencies and/or incidents. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: Depending upon your scope and/or level of practice, these are some of the warning signs that a patient's condition is deteriorating: Acute change in mental status. Acute change in heart rate. Acute change in respiratory rate or effort. Acute decrease in oxygen saturation. Acute decrease in systolic blood pressure. Acute decrease in urinary output. Uncontrolled bleeding. You are worried that the patient is deteriorating for some other reason. PATIENT SAFETY \"READ BACK\" REQUIREMENTS DETERIORATING PATIENT CONDITION PATIENT SAFETY 130LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKIf you are concerned that a patient's condition is deteriorating, notify the RN responsible for that patient right away, and explain what concerns you. The patient's nurse will assess the situation and call for additional assistance if needed. RNs are trained on when and how to activate Emergency Response Teams (Man Down Team, Code Blue Team or Airway Team), if necessary. In other areas of the main hospital, nurses should contact a physician or nurse manager for assistance if they are concerned about a patient. Anyone can call a Code Blue for respiratory or cardiac arrest by dialing Ext. 111 from a hospital phone. In areas outside the main hospital buildings/areas, call 9-1-1 for a medical emergency . Prevention of patient falls is the responsibility of EVERY workforce member. Creating a safe environment, enforcing fall prevention through education and training, and teaching patients reduces fall rates. Outpatient Clinics (Hospital-Based and Ambulatory Care Network) will screen patients and mitigate risks for falls and harm, based on the patient population, setting, and environment. Documentation, as applicable, will include: Fall screening Fall risk Fall prevention measures implemented and patient education provided Hospitalized inpatients (1 year of age and older) will be assessed on admission, and reassessed daily , on transfer to another unit, with condition change, and post fall. The staff will document the following in the medical record: Using the appropriate Fall Risk Assessment Tool, the initial assessment and ongoing reassessments. Patient/family education related to falls. Ongoing safety precautions. Any fall incident, related assessment, and notification of physician/family . Emergency Department patients will be screened for fall risk using specific assessment screening elements. The staff will document all fall reduction interventions and patient/family education in the medical record. Appropriate fall prevention measures will be implemented for all patients identified as 'at risk' for falls. If any screening criteria element is positive, a licensed health care professional will implement and document interventions to reduce the risk of falls; to include patient/family education. ORGANIZATION/FACILITY ASSESSMENT OF FALL RISK: There is, at minimum, an annual assessment of each facility's patient fall risk to determine prevention and intervention measures. The assessment may include, but not limited to, periodic environmental rounds, patient safety rounds, medical staf f committee determination of risk based on clinical conditions, and review of adverse events (related to falls). Performance Improvement, Quality Control, Monitoring, Reporting, and Benchmarking will be performed on a quarterly basis utilizing the identified DHS Fall Database. DHS Employee Fall Prevention Program education will include training to all current DHS providers, nursing and clinical ancillary staff on the DHS System-Wide Fall Prevention Program. Additionally, the DHS System-Wide Fall Prevention Program will be incorporated into the New Employee Orientation Program. DEFINITION OF A FALL Fall: A patient fall is a witnessed or un-witnessed unplanned descent to the floor or extension to the floor (e.g. trashcan or other equipment) with or without injury to the patient. All types of falls are included whether they result from physiological reasons (fainting) or environmental reasons (slippery floor). This would include assisted falls, such as when a staff member attempts to minimize the impact of the fall by easing the patient's descent to the floor or by breaking the patient's fall. Rehabilitation Fall: A fall that occurs while a patient is engaging in purposeful actions as a result of a rehabilitation therapy session (i.e., high challenge balance activities, fall recovery, etc. with therapist) that has the intent of challenging a patient's balance or attempting a functional activity the patient is unable to perform without assistance.FALL REDUCTION AND PREVENTION PATIENT SAFETY 131LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK PATIENT SAFETYHOSPITAL BASED OUTPATIENTS Outpatient Setting (Hospital-Based and Ambulatory Care Clinics): A. Screening for fall risk may be applied across a clinic or patient-specific: 1. Certain patient populations, settings, and environments pose an equivocal increased risk for falls. Risk may be based on factors, including but not limited to, patient demographics, diagnoses, medical condition, clinical situation, mobility, and ambulatory/mobility equipment needs. Clinic-wide screening may include: Periodic Environmental Rounds Validation of clinic-wide safeguards (e.g. hand rails, level flooring/surfaces, wheelchair/walker access, grab bars) Patient Education Staff Education Evaluation of previous year's fall data 2. Screen each adult and/or pediatric patient (over 1 year of age) for fall risk using the age appropriate screening tool. Adult Ambulatory Care Fall Screening Criteria Pediatric Ambulatory Care Fall Screening Criteria (patient >1 year of age) B. Patients identified as high risk during either screening methods will have a licensed professional further determine, implement, and document appropriate prevention measures including patient/family education. C. Outpatient Fall Prevention Measures 1. Maintain a safe, hazard free environment (remove any obstacles from patient pathway). 2. Place 'at-risk' patients who are identified as needing assistance on exam table only at the time of examination, with staff present. 3. Provide assistance with toileting, when appropriate, for safety reasons (ensure privacy when doing so). 4. Ensure adequate lighting. 5. Use wheelchair locks when indicated. 6. Keep beds, stretchers, and/or gurneys in lowest, locked position with side rails up, as appropriate. 7. Keep call light within reach, as applicable. 8. Identify and manage areas of concern during Environmental/Safety Rounds. 9. Do not leave the children unattended when using equipment such as strollers, walkers, infant seats or swings. 10. Notify the appropriate professional for focused fall reduction interventions and patient/family education, including, but not limited to: Diagnosis and treatment underlying etiology of fall risk. Ensure 'fall risk' alert armband is in place based on patient condition and determination of fall risk. 11. Provide patient/family education regarding: Fall risk determination. Safety measures for prevention of falls during their outpatient visit. Rising slowly from a sitting or lying position. If possible, consider having patient relocate to an area that allows closer nursing observation. 12. Offer wheelchair, if appropriate. 13. Ensure assistive devices (e.g., cane, crutches, walker, wheelchair) are within reach of the patient. 14. Assist patients walking with medical equipment, as appropriate (e.g., wound vacuum devices, IV poles, oxygen tubing, tanks, etc.). 15. Alert subsequent providers that patient is a fall risk (e.g., during transfers or hand-of f to another clinical area/ service). D. Post-Fall Procedure After a patient fall, initiate the Post-Fall Evaluation and Management Algorithm and complete all post fall documentation in the medical record. 132LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKOUTPATIENT FALL PREVENTION MEASURES For ALL Patients For AT-RISK Patients Maintain a safe, hazard free environment (remove any obstacles from patient pathway).

Patients will be reassessed daily, upon inter-unit transfer, upon change of status, or post fall to determine the need for Fall Prevention Measures (FPM) implementation. PATIENT SAFETYRisk Determination Adults Low RiskAny adult patient who receives a score of 0-24 on the Morse Fall Scale is considered as low risk. Level 1 interventions will be implemented for these patients. Moderate RiskAny adult patient who receives a score of 25-50 on the Morse Fall Scale is considered as moderate risk. Level 2 interventions will be implemented for these patients in addition to Level 1 interventions. High RiskAny adult patient who receives a score of 51 and higher on the Morse Fall Scale is considered as high risk. Level 3 interventions will be implemented for these patients in addition to Level 1 and 2 interventions. When a patient is identified as moderate or high risk for falls, the nursing staf f will initiate a plan of care related to the patient's identified risk factors and place a colored \"fall risk\" alert arm band on the patient. Place a sign at the entrance to the patient's room and/or head of the patient's bed. Place a fall precaution sticker on front of patient's chart. Pediatrics Low RiskAny pediatric patient who receives a score of 7-11 on the Humpty Dumpty Scale is considered low risk and \"General Fall Prevention Interventions for All Children\" will be implemented for these patients. High RiskAny pediatric patient who receives a score of 12 or above on the Humpty Dumpty Scale is considered high risk for falls and will be placed on Fall Prevention Measures for High Risk for the duration of his/her hospitalization. If in the judgment of the RN, a child no longer meets the high risk for falls criteria, a falls risk reassessment may be performed and documented to justify the discontinuation of the high risk for falls identification and implementation of Falls Prevention Measures. If, in the nurse's judgment, any pediatric patient is considered to be at risk for falls, in spite of not meeting the criteria for high risk, the nurse may identify the child as high risk for falls and initiate Fall Prevention Measures. Initiation of Plan of Care When a patient is identified as moderate or high risk for falls, the RN will initiate a plan of care related to the patient's identified risk factors. Injury and/or fall prevention strategies, including patient/family education will be incorporated into the plan of care for at risk patients. Fall Prevention Measures When a patient is identified as moderate or high risk for falls either on admission or during his/her hospitalization, the RN will implement the following fall prevention measures: 134LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK PATIENT SAFETYAdults Level 1 Low Risk Score: 0 - 24 The patient's risk for falls will be discussed with interdisciplinary team members.

Safe ambulation/transfer techniques. Importance of wearing non-skid footwear. Reporting environmental hazards to nursing staff (e.g., spills, cluttered passages). Family/ significant others may assist with fall reduction strategies once fall management training is completed. ( Note: staff remains responsible for overall safety of patients even with family in attendance). Perform intentional rounds. Orient patient to surroundings and hospital routines. During exchange of patients between staff, hand off communication should include fall risk level, supervision provided, and observation of unsafe behaviors. Set the bed in the lowest position with brakes locked. Place personal belongings within reach on the bedside stand/table. Reduce room clutter. Remove unnecessary equipment and furniture. Provide non-skid (non-slip) footwear. Level 2 Moderate Risk Score: 25 - 50 Attach fall prevention stickers to the front of the medical record. Place a sign at the entrance to the patient's room and/or head of the patient's bed. Offer toileting, minimally, every 2 hours. Activate the bed alarm and wheelchair seat belt alarm, if appropriate. Level 3 High Risk Score: 51 and higher Increase frequency of nursing rounds based on patient need. Collaborate with interdisciplinary team for therapy schedule/ activities. Cohort patients, when possible. Restraints are discouraged, however, if needed, apply per Hospital Specific Restraint Policy. Provide continuous in-person observation with a trained staff member as needed for safety reasons. Place the patient in a room or area where they can be easily observed. Offer toileting, minimally, every 2 hours. Stay with patient at all times while toileting out of bed. Refusal by patient for direct observation during toileting must be documented in the patient' s medical record, as applicable. (Further assessment may be necessary should patient exhibit conditions such as dementia, confusion, altered gait, combative, withdrawals, etc.). Notify the appropriate licensed professional of patient's refusal. Pediatrics General Fall Prevention MeasuresChildren can fall because of developmental, environmental and situational risks. The following strategies shall be implemented for all children: Do not leave children unattended when using equipment such as strollers, walkers, infant seats or swings. Leave crib side rails up at all times unless an adult is at the bedside. Bed type and size shall be determined based on child's developmental and clinical needs. Instruct patient/parent on how to prevent falls in the hospital setting: Maintain side rails in appropriate position. Maintain crib rails up. Do not allow the child to jump on the bed. Do not allow the child to run in the room or hallway. Do not allow the child to climb on hospital furniture or equipment. Explain the importance of wearing non-skid footwear. Notify the nurse if the child complains of dizziness, feeling weak or seems less coordinated than usual. Notify nursing staff of environmental hazards (e.g., spills, cluttered passages). Supervise the child's activities (e.g. walk next to the child and provide support as strength and balance are regained). 135LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKFall Prevention Measures for High Risk Consider locating the child closer to nursing station for closer observation. Assess and anticipate the reasons the child gets out of bed such as elimination needs, restlessness, confusion and pain. Offer assistance with toileting, minimally, every 2 hours while awake. Stay with child at all times while toileting out of bed. Refusal by the child's parent/guardian for direct observation during toileting must be documented in the patient's medical record. Notify the appropriate licensed professional of child's parent/guardian's refusal. Provide calming interventions and pain relief. Accompany patient with ambulation. Monitor medication profiles for children receiving medications that may increase their risk for falls (e.g., narcotics, sedatives, anti-seizure medications). Set bed alarms, as appropriate, to alert when child is exiting the bed. Evaluate need for and encourage family to remain at the child's bedside. Assess need for continuous in-person observation with a trained staf f member, as needed, for safety reasons. Provide patient/family education related to fall prevention (in addition to education related to general injury prevention above): Purpose and importance of fall/injury prevention measures. Use of call light/maintaining bedrails in appropriate position. Safe ambulation/transfer techniques. Instruct family of pediatric patients to inform the nurse and/or physician if the child seems to be less coordinated than usual, or complains of dizziness or feeling weak. Instruct family of pediatric patients that until the child regains his/her strength, someone should walk alongside him/her to provide support and protection in case he/she loses his/her balance. Post-Fall Procedure After a patient fall initiate the Post-Fall Evaluation and Management Algorithm and complete all post fall documentation in the medical record. Each facility has policies and procedures in place that should be reviewed regularly. Use your facility's report mechanism for falls and medical response. Documentation and assessment tools for patient fall risks and high fall risk patient alerts vary for each facility. Follow your facility's protocols and guidelines as set forth. First Responder Stay with patient. Call for help. Check patient f or pain or injury, check LOC Report fall to licensed personnel. Provide comfort measures until licensed staff member arrives and assesses patient for injury Licensed Provider: Assesses patient as ap after fall Provides follow -up orders, medical, and diagnostic work -up, and care as indicated Reviews patient's medications.

Post Fall Procedure After a patient fall, initiate the Post-Fall Evaluation and Management Algorithm and complete all post-fall documentation in the medical record. LAC+USC Medical Center has adopted all components of Joint Commission' s Universal Protocol intended to prevent wrong site, wrong procedure and wrong person surgery or procedures. The Universal Protocol establishes a process for a defined series of pre-procedure verifications designed to maximize patient safety and well-being. It applies to invasive procedures performed in the operating room as well as those performed in non-operating room settings (e.g., bronchoscopy , endoscopy, interventional radiology, cardiac catheterization, and the bedside). You share in the responsibility of conducting this verification process in cooperation with the patient. The three main components are: 1. Pre-Operative/Pre-Procedure Verification - LAC+USC Medical Center uses a DHS Standardized Final Surgical Timeout checklist to ensure all relevant documents are available and correct before sending a patient for an invasive procedure. Ensure that the patient's history and physical is present and current, that we obtained the patient's informed consent, and that the patient agrees to the planned surgery/procedure. If you find any information missing or any discrepancy , postpone the procedure until the information is clarified and/or corrected. 2. Marking the Operative Site - LAC+USC Medical Center requires site marking for all surgical sites/invasive procedures involving right/left distinction, multiple structures, or levels. For exceptions to site marking at LAC+USC, the physician marks the patient's skin with the word \"YES\" to indicate the intended site. Whenever possible, involve the patient in the marking process. 3. \"TIME OUT\" - Immediately before starting the procedure, all members of the service delivery team conduct a final verbal verification to confirm the correct identity of the patient, planned procedure, operative site, side, and level. In the Operating Room (OR) and other dedicated procedure areas, the nurse documents the \"TIME OUT\" on the back of the Pre-Op/Pre-Procedure Record. In non-specialty areas (e.g., bedside procedures), the physician documents the occurrence of the \"TIME OUT\" in his/her procedure note. Use of the Universal Protocol is required for procedures for non-OR settings, including bedside procedures. Pre-procedure verification of relevant documents and informed consent is necessary . Site marking must be done for any procedure that involves laterality, multiple structures or level, when there is not an obvious wound or lesion. All those who will be participating in the procedure conduct a DHS Standardized Non-OR Procedural Time Out before the start of the procedure. UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL PATIENT SAFETY 138LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKThe ASK NICE mnemonic captures the core components of the Time Out: A - announce time out/allergy check, S - specimen, K- \"K\"orrect patient, procedure, site/laterality, N - needed equipment, I - informed consent, C - coagulation status, E - expiration date \"call out\" when supplies and medications are opened. Attestation of performance of a Time Out, including the date and time, is documented in the electronic medical record. In non-specialty areas (e.g., bedside procedures), the provider documents the occurrence of the \"TIME OUT\" in his/her procedure note. Managing the use of medications to enhance patient safety is very important and involves multiple services and disciplines working closely together. When ordering/prescribing medications, it is important to remember the following: There is a documented diagnosis, condition, or indication for use for each medication ordered. As applicable, weight-based dosing for pediatric patients is required. Medication orders are written clearly. Dangerous abbreviations, acronyms or symbols are not used when writing orders. An enforcement feedback policy and procedures are in effect at LAC+USC. MEDICATION USE The medication use process involves multiple steps in order to ensure the delivery of the right medication to the right patient, at the right dose, at the right time, using the right route. The following are several important medication use practices to ensure medication safety and reduce the potential for medication-related events. MEDICATION PRESCRIBING As a practitioner, you have the responsibility of ensuring the appropriate prescribing of medications to your patients in an effort to decrease the potential risk for medication errors. You must clearly understand the correct indication, dose, route, and the pharmacological effects of each medication that you prescribe to avoid adverse drug events. LAC+USC Medical Center encourages you to review the formulary on an ongoing basis, and utilize formulary-approved medications. 2018 DHS Annual Laboratory and Pathology Core Competency Study Guide 38 MEDICATION MANAGEMENT PATIENT SAFETYFreepik(213) 288-7233 139LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKSAFETY TIPS FOR SAFE MEDICATION PRESCRIBING Medication orders should, specify the name of the medication, drug dosage, route, and frequency . All prescriptions should be prescribed and/or documented in ORCHID specifying the name of the medication, drug dosage, route, and frequency . Make your medication orders clear and complete by: Identifying the patient with TWO identifiers (Patient Name and MRUN). Placing the date and time on all orders. Using generic drug names on all medication orders. Including specific dose, route, and frequency. Not using range orders (Pharmacy will not accept ranges such as 1-2 tabs; q 4-6h in orders). Qualifying all as needed (PRN) orders (e.g., PRN severe, mild, moderate pain). Signing all orders and printing your name and physician number so that you may be located for any questions. Entering the patient's diagnosis, allergies, and height/weight on all admitting orders to avoid delay in dispensing. Using weight-based dosing on all pediatric patients less than 40 kg of weight. Avoiding the use of unapproved abbreviations. When in doubt, do not abbreviate. To prevent any confusion, spell out the entire name of the drug. PROHIBITED & UNSAFE SAFE & ACCEPTABLE RATIONALE Drug Name Abbreviations MgSO4 MSO4 MSUse the complete spelling for drug names Magnesium sulfate Morphine sulfateHelps reduce misinterpretation. Clarifies which medication is being ordered. Q.D Write: daily Clarifies frequency of dose Q.O.D. Write: every other day Clarifies frequency of dose U or u Write: unit The abbreviation can look like a \"0\" and result in dosage errors IU Write: international units The abbreviation can look like a \"10\" and result in dosage errors Do not use apothecary symbols for dram and minimWrite out the metric system equivalentReduces the chances of order/directions being misread. qn (nightly) Write: bedtime Clarifies time that medication is to be taken. BT Write: bedtime Clarifies time that medication is to be taken. Prohibited only for medication related notations Do not use trailing zeros (example: 5.0 mg)Write: 5 mgUnnecessary 0's after the decimal point can be misread and result in dosage errors. Do not omit preceding zeros when writing decimals that are less than a whole number (example: .2mg)Write: 0.2mgAlways put a zero before a decimal point to avoid the dosage being misread as a whole number. PATIENT SAFETY PROHIBITED/UNSAFE ABBREVIATION LIST: DO NOT USE Make Patient Safety a Part of Your Patent Care Routine! The following abbreviations/symbols are unacceptable at LAC+USC and shall NOT be used for patient medication orders: 140LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK PATIENT SAFETY\"LOOK-ALIKE/SOUND-ALIKE\" MEDICATIONS To further enhance medication safety, please refer to the ISMP list of look alike, sound alike medications. These medications are stored apart in the Pharmacy and in patient care areas. Special attention should be given when administering one of these drugs to ensure that it is the correct drug. Be aware that \"Tall-Man\" lettering is used to differentiate look alike/sound alike drugs. The following strategies are implemented at LAC+USC Medical Center to minimize medication errors associated with look-alike, sound-alike (LASA) medications: Tall man lettering is used to describe LASA drugs on medication labels, Medication Administration Record (MAR). LASA drugs are separated where drugs are stored and labeled with a cautionary sticker. Prescribers are encouraged to include the indication for use when prescribing LASA DISPENSING Before dispensing medications, the pharmacists must review all medication orders for appropriate indication, dose, route, frequency, and drug/allergy interactions. The pharmacist utilizes the patient's age, height, weight, and diagnosis provided to determine appropriateness, and reviews the patient medication profile to avoid therapeutic duplication and drug interactions. If orders are incorrect or require clarification, the pharmacist will contact the prescriber to clarify before dispensing the medication. MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION AND BAR CODE SCANNING If you administer medication to patients, you are responsible for properly performing patient identification (using two identifiers , Patient Name and MRUN , per hospital policy). Use the Medication Administration Record (MAR) in ORCHID to review and document medication administration. Bar Code Scanning is used for proper identification of patients and medications. 141LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOKPATIENT'S OWN MEDICATIONS Patients should not bring their own medications into the hospital. Medications shall be given back to the patient' s family/ representative, when admitted to the hospital. Under limited and unusual circumstances, the patient' s own medication may be used according to guidelines established by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. If the medication is to be stored in the Pharmacy Department until discharge, medications (controlled drugs, drugs requiring refrigeration will be placed in separate security bags) are to be listed, packaged in the security bag, and sealed, along with a completed \"Patient's Own Medications Deposit\" form. The required information includes: the patient's name, MRUN number, ward location, Valuables PAK number, and total containers. If it is determined that there is a compelling reason to use the patient' s own medication, the medication shall not be administered unless: 1. The drugs have been positively identified by the pharmacist. 2. There is a written order for the medication in the patient's medical record signed by the person lawfully authorized to give such an order. 3. The medication containers are clearly and properly labeled. ADVERSE DRUG REACTION (ADR) REPORTING All adverse drug reactions need to be documented in the MAR in the patient' s allergy/side effects profile. Once documented it must be reported in the Safety Intelligence Event Reporting System by the end of the shift of occurrence or becoming aware of the event. All events shall be reported even if only partial statements of fact are available at the time the report is entered. MEDICATION ERRORS A medication error is any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm. Such events may be related to professional practice, health care products, procedures and systems, including prescribing; order communication; product labeling, packaging and nomenclature; compounding; dispensing; distribution; administration; education; monitoring and use. Report all medication events, (including an identified potential medication error), through the Safety Intelligence (SI) Event Reporting System. LAC+USC Medical Center is dedicated to preventing, reducing, and ultimately eliminating, the use of restraints throughout our facility. We are committed to using non-physical interventions to control and prevent emergencies that have the potential to lead to the use of restraints and/or seclusion. These less restrictive measures include verbal de-escalation, decreased stimulation, medication administration and provision of diversion activities. When used for behavior management, limit restraints to those emergency situations in which the behavior presents an immediate and serious danger to the safety of the patient, other patients, staff or visitors. When maintaining safety requires an immediate physical response, a \" Code Gold \" is activated to dispatch the Behavioral Response Team (BRT) to diffuse crises and maintain safety. The BRT works collaboratively with other staff present in an attempt to de-escalate the emergency. If efforts to de-escalate fail, and physical intervention is necessary, the BRT may initiate restraints. The BRT provides 24 hours, 7 days/week coverage throughout the hospital to assist in these emergencies. The team is composed of licensed and non-licensed staff and is under the direction of a Registered Nurse. Training All members of the BRT receive specialized training in non-violent crisis intervention, less restrictive alternatives and restraint application. Team members must demonstrate competency in: Non-Violent Crisis Intervention TechniquesNON-VIOLENT (NON-SELF DESTRUCTIVE) & VIOLENT (SELF-DESTRUCTIVE) RESTRAINTS PATIENT SAFETY 142LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK Management of Aggressive Behavior Restraint Application Restraint and/or Seclusion Policy/Protocol Care of Patients in Restraints and/or Seclusion Restraint Documentation CODE GOLD ACTIVATION 1.

CCONTINUOUS OBSERVATIONPatient monitoring/assessments. Begin medical record entry with an identifier (e.g., Attending note, Cardiology Fellow note). Legibly sign and indicate identification number and degree on all paper documents. Electronic signatures do not require a separate time or date if that information is automatically recorded by the system. All verbal orders must be validated/authenticated as soon as the emergency permits and before leaving the patient. LAC+USC Medical Center pharmacies accept verbal orders from a prescribing physician only in extreme emergencies, in the course of treatment, or during a surgical procedure. Specify reason(s) when prescribing the medication on all as needed (PRN) orders (i.e., conditions/symptoms, etc.). If a handwritten error is made while charting in the medical record, make the correction by drawing a single line through the error . Write the correction along with the date, time and your initials. Do not document the word \"ERROR.\" Erasing or using \"white out\" is not allowed in a patient's medical record. If an error is made in the electronic medical record, follow procedures in accordance with established protocols.MEDICAL RECORD REQUIREMENTS FOR PHYSICIAN AND LICENSED INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS (LIPS) PATIENT SAFETY 143LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER (CLINICAL STAFF) KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER (CLINICAL STAFF) PROVISION OF CARE Know the characteristics of each population group that you serve. LAC+USC Medical Center supports every patient's right to have his/her pain assessed and treated promptly, effectively, and for as long as the pain persists. Know that \" Code Blue\" means adult cardiac (or cardiopulmonary) arrest, and \" Code White \" means pediatric cardiac or cardiopulmonary arrest. PATIENT SAFETY Use \"READ-BACK\" procedures to ensure important information is accurately communicated and recorded. LAC+USC Medical Center has instituted \"read-back\" procedures to confirm the accuracy of orders issued over the telephone, verbal orders issued during an emergency or in the course of a procedure, and critical test results reported either by telephone or verbally to a patient care provider. You must know how to seek medical assistance when there is a decline in patient condition. Prevention of patient falls is the responsibility of EVERY workforce member. Become familiar with the LAC+USC Fall/ Injury Prevention Program. Universal Protocol applies to all surgical and nonsurgical invasive procedures and establishes a process for preventing wrong site, wrong procedure and wrong person surgery or procedure. The Universal Protocol's three main components are: conduct the pre-procedure verification process, mark the operative site, and perform a \"Time Out\" before the procedure. The medication process must ensure that the right medication is administered to the right patient, at the right dose, at the right time, using the right route. Adverse drug reactions must be reported to the Adverse Drug Reaction phone number (323) 226-2246. Report all medication events, whether an actual medication error or an identified potential medication error , through the LAC+USC Medical Center Safety Intelligence (SI) Event Reporting System. Avoid the use of unapproved abbreviations . When in doubt, do not abbreviate ! To prevent any confusion, spell out the entire name of the drug. LAC+USC Medical Center will dispatch a Behavioral Response Team (BRT) for a \" Code Gold \" emergency. LAC+USC Medical Center is committed to using non-physical interventions to control and prevent emergencies that have the potential to lead to the use of restraints. Use of restraints should be limited to those emergency situations in which the behavior presents an immediate and serious danger to the safety of the patient, other patients, staf f or visitors, and when maintaining safety requires an immediate physical response. All medical records must contain an identifier, legible signature and identification number, counter signature for verbal orders, and a rationale for medicine prescribed. LAC+USC Medical Center's direct patient care workforce member obtains clinical information from other treatment sites by requesting the patient's medical record from the Health Information Management (HIM) Department. Patient information may also be accessed through \"ORCHID\", an electronic patient information system. Access to the system is controlled through a security clearance process. Staff authorized to make entries in the medical record (paper or electronic) is limited to medical, nursing and ancillary staff. 144LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER | 2022-2023 ORIENTATION / REORIENTATION HANDBOOK145 KNOWLEDGE CHECK 1.
