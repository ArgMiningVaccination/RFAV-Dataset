It reflects an increasingly stable connection to'something bigger than us' that is translating into the world of behaviors, habits and attitudes.\" I want to be very clear here and point out that spiritual intelligence is a skill that is separate from spirituality or religion. Spirituality is our innate need to be connected to something greater than ourselves; religion consists of specific beliefs and rituals. Spirituality and religion may nurture spiritual intelligence, but spiritual intelligence can be developed without tradition or belief. [Spiritual intelligence](https://austinhealingacupuncture.com/spiritual-intelligence-live-a-more-spiritual-life/) is a set of skills we can develop over time, with practice. We are all born as innately spiritual beings, but we are not born spiritually intelligent. Just like we are all born with emotions, we still need to learn emotional intelligence to be able to recognize and manage our feelings as well as maintain healthy relationships with others. My life experiences, including my husband's long journey of living with cancer, have taken me down a multitude of unexpected paths leading to many wise teachers and profound teachings. I love sharing these teachings in my acupuncture practice to help people live in a more heart- and body-centered way. When I found Cindy's book, I was immediately intrigued with the idea of \"21 skills of spiritual intelligence\" and wanted to learn more. I'm currently in training with Cindy to be certified as a SQ21 Coach. Learning how to deepen my own spiritual intelligence has been a powerfully transforming experience. If you are interested, I would love to share these skills with you so you can deepen into spiritual awareness in your own life.
