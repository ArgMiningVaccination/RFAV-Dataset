When Can Babies Have Ice Cream? Babies can have ice cream after the age of 12 months, as it is a dairy product.

According to the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, discretionary foods and drinks such as ice cream and other ice confections should be avoided as they do not help meet the infant's nutrition needs [ (2)](https://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/healthy+living/healthy+eating/healthy+eating+at+different+ages+and+stages+of+your+life/healthy+eating+for+babies+and+young+children). However, you can introduce ice-creams in moderation after consulting with a pediatrician and give them occasionally to the baby. 3 Reasons To Avoid Ice Cream For Babies Below One Year The first 12 months are crucial for your baby as you introduce [nutritious food](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/baby-weaning-foods_006615/), and build a taste for healthy foods. Therefore, the first 12-month period is too early to feed your baby ice cream. Here are a few reasons why you should avoid ice cream during this time: 1. Preservatives Almost all the ice creams in the market contain preservatives, fat, sugar, artificial ingredients, and food coloring [ (3)](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/resources/highschool/chemmatters/past-issues/archive-2013-2014/ice-cream-chemistry.html). So, it is worth a wait until your baby's first birthday. 2. Whole milk Ice cream is a milk-based dessert and may be sensitive to whole milk and cream [ (4)](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Milk-Allergy-Foods-and-Ingredients-to-Avoid.aspx). If the baby is exclusively breastfed, he or she may not be exposed [to cow milk](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/introduce-cows-milk-childs-diet_0074148/). The baby may have lactose intolerance too. [(4)](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Milk-Allergy-Foods-and-Ingredients-to-Avoid.aspx). 3.

Next, we tell you how to introduce ice cream to your baby. 4 Tips To Introduce Ice Cream For Babies Talk to your pediatrician before giving your baby an ice cream for the first time. Here are a few points to remember: 1. Say 'no' to street vendors Most commercial ice creams are heat pasteurized to kill the bacteria but be careful from where you are buying it. Never buy ice cream from a street vendor because you can never be sure about the sanitary and storage conditions at such places. Bacteria might build up in improper storage conditions. The water used by the local ice cream vendors may not be of the best quality. Poor water quality and contaminated milk could lead to gastrointestinal infections in the little one. 2. Be sure about the ingredients Read the ingredient list carefully before offering ice cream to your little one. Certain ingredients could cause [allergic reactions](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/symptoms-of-milk-allergy-in-kids_00663420/). Some common ingredients in ice cream, which could be allergic, are nuts, peanuts, strawberries, and coloring agents. Avoid ice creams made of raw milk as it can carry bacteria [ (5)](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/raw-milk-questions-and-answers.html). Choose a simpler ice cream without too many additional ingredients. 3. Do not overdo Start with small bites. After introducing an ice cream, do not overfeed just because your little one is enjoying it. The sugar content can be harmful to your baby as too much of it could lead to potential tooth decay, and overweight in the long run. Offer just a spoon or two at a time and not more than once in a week or two. [(8)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.855004/full). 4. Offer alternatives If your baby loves ice cream, you can feed them desserts such as homemade creamy smoothies, fruit milkshakes, flavored yogurt, fruit custard or pudding, fresh fruit slices, chilled fruit purees, natural fruit sorbets, and homemade fruit gelatos. Chill them just before serving to give them the feel of ice cream. Exposure to cold ice cream can damage the pharynx mucosa and abrasions in the pharynx can lead to pharyngitis. Avoid giving ice cream in the cold weather or if the baby is sneezing or has a runny nose. Sweet-flavored ice creams, milkshake bars, and those without nuts are better.
