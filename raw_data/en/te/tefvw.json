Human breast milk is the only food that infants need for the first six months of life, and they can receive all the nutrition they need through it. There are many health benefits that arise from breastfeeding, as the cells, hormones, and antibodies in breastmilk help to protect babies from illness. While the rate of protection is different for everyone, research shows that babies who were breastfed have a lower risk of certain illnesses. We have listed some below: - Asthma - Leukemia (during childhood) - Obesity (during childhood) - Ear infections - Eczema - Diarrhea and vomiting - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) - Type 2 diabetes While there are many benefits to breastfeeding, it's important to consider what factors may play a role in the decision on whether or not to breastfeed.

If you are grilling for the Fourth of July or anytime this summer, let's review steps for a safe and fun grilling season. When you handle raw meat, poultry, and seafood remember to: - Separate - When shopping, pick up meat, poultry, and seafood last and separate them from other food in your shopping cart and grocery bags. - Refrigerate - Keep food chilled until ready to grill.

The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has implemented the new guidance from the CDC effective immediately. What is the updated guidance? - Monovalent (original) COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are no longer authorized for use in the U.S. - CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 years and older receive a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of whether they previously completed their (monovalent) primary series. - Individuals ages 6 years and older who have already received a bivalent mRNA vaccine do not need to take any action unless they are 65 years or older or immunocompromised. - For young children, multiple doses continue to be recommended and will vary by age, vaccine, and which vaccines were previously received. - CDC recommendations allow an additional bivalent vaccine dose for adults aged 65 years and older and additional bivalent doses for people who are immunocompromised. If needed, this additional COVID-19 vaccine dose should be administered at least four months after their initial bivalent dose.

Kidney disease is known as the \"silent disease\" because there are usually no symptoms at the early stages. The earlier you find out if you have kidney disease the sooner you can take steps to protect the health of your kidneys. What Can I Do to Keep My Kidneys Healthy? Know Your Risk Even if you feel healthy, if you are over 60 or have risk factors like: - High blood pressure - Heart disease - Diabetes Consider talking with your doctor or health care professional team about getting tested for kidney disease. They will use two fast tests to check for kidney disease. A urine test can check for damage, and a blood test can check how well your kidneys are in getting rid of wastes from your blood.

These growths in the colon or rectum are known as precancerous polyps. A screening test which is used to look for disease when a person does not have symptoms can find these precancerous polyps. If found, they can be removed before they turn into cancer. Also, a screening test can find colorectal cancer early which is when treatment works best. Screening is key to preventing cancer. You can learn about the several types of colorectal screening tests at [http://bit.ly/3Yr15C2](http://bit.ly/3Yr15C2) How Often Should I Get Screened and Why?

Symptoms of RSV infection usually include: Runny nose Decrease in appetite Coughing Sneezing Fever Wheezing These symptoms usually appear in stages and not all at once. In very young infants with RSV the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties. Almost all children will have had an RSV infection by their second birthday. Care Most RSV infections go away on their own in a week or two. There is no specific treatment for RSV infection, though researchers are working to develop vaccines and antivirals (medicines that fight viruses). Take steps to relieve symptoms Manage fever and pain: Over-the-counter fever reducers and pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. (Never give aspirin to children.) Drink enough fluids: It is important for people with RSV infection to drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration (loss of body fluids). Talk to your healthcare provider: Before giving your child nonprescription cold medicines, because some medicines contain ingredients that are not good for children. Immediately call your healthcare professional (s) if you or your child is having difficulty breathing, not drinking enough fluids, or experiencing worsening symptoms.

Learn more about EUAs in this video. The Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen and Novavax COVID-19 vaccines will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in US history. This monitoring includes using both established and new safety monitoring systems to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Common Side Effects Some people have side effects after getting their COVID-19 vaccine, while others might have no side effects. Side effects may affect the ability to do daily activities, but they should go away within a few days. Learn more about common side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. Adverse Events (Serious Safety Problems) Are Rare In rare cases, people have experienced serious health events after COVID-19 vaccination. Any health problem that happens after vaccination is considered an adverse event. An adverse event can be caused by the vaccine or can be caused by a coincidental event not related to the vaccine, such as an unrelated fever, that happened following vaccination.

People should contact their healthcare provider if they have fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes and a new, unexplained rash. People who are diagnosed with monkeypox (mpox) should stay home and avoid close contact with others until the rash has fully resolved, the scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of intact skin has formed. For most people, infection with mpox is painful but not life threatening. Mpox is a preventable disease that spreads from person to person through close contact. There are things everyone can do to help prevent the spread: Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with someone with a new, unexplained rash. Do not share cups, utensils, bedding or towels with someone who is sick. Stay home when you are sick. Wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after contact with infected people or animals. Wear a mask in situations where you may have lengthy or close face-to-face contact with people who may be infected. Get vaccinated with the JYNNEOS mpox vaccine, if you are eligible. People who may have been exposed to mpox should receive the vaccine as soon as possible to reduce the chance of developing mpox after exposure. The vaccine is most effective if administered within 4 days of exposure, but it may be administered up to 14 days after exposure. Contact your local health department to see if you are eligible for vaccination and to find out where it is available. Healthcare providers with patients at high risk of severe illness should work with their local health department to facilitate administration of the JYNNEOS vaccine and options for treatment of mpox. For more information, healthcare providers can access the Healthcare Providers website for mpox. VDH has the latest information available to the public at its mpox website. The site also includes information about cases and vaccines administered in Virginia. The VDH call center is another source of information regarding mpox and vaccination and treatment options; call (877) VAX-IN-VA - (877) 829-4682- Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with assistance in English, Spanish and more than 100 other languages.

This is especially important because as temperatures cool, we spend more time indoors with others, and may travel to gather with friends and family for celebrations who are at increased risk of severe complications from infection. Virginia is already seeing [widespread reports](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/influenza-flu-in-virginia/influenza-surveillance/) of the influenza virus detected in recent weeks. This year's flu season is already showing concerning, early signs that it may be worse than in recent years. More people are seeking care in hospitals and urgent care centers for influenza-like illness than at this point in previous years, particularly young children aged 0-4 years. Virginia health officials encourage everyone aged six months and older to get a flu vaccine this fall, with rare exception. In addition, Virginia is seeing cases of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). RSV is common and usually causes mild to moderate cold-like symptoms but can be very dangerous for babies, young children or those who are immunocompromised. Emergency department and urgent care visits with diagnosed RSV have been increasing rapidly since early September. Practice preventive health habits to reduce the chance of infection and call your healthcare provider if you or your child is having difficulty breathing, not drinking enough fluids, or experiencing worsening symptoms. There is no vaccine to protect against RSV or many of the other common winter viruses. For further information contact your Health Care Provider.

What is the difference between the updated COVID-19 bivalent boosters and the initial COVID-19 vaccines and boosters? The initial COVID-19 vaccines were made to protect against the original COVID-19 strain. They are considered monovalent vaccines because they target one strain of the virus. The COVID-19 bivalent booster vaccines target both the original type of COVID- 19 and the recent Omicron variant, specifically the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. The updated COVID-19 booster provides better protection against the strains of COVID-19 that are currently circulating. This is similar to flu vaccines, which are updated each year to target specific newer strains of the flu that are expected to spread. Are there side effects associated with the booster dose? Reactions reported after the booster dose are similar to those of the primary series: most often, pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, and fever. Most side effects are mild to moderate and go away in a few days. As with the primary vaccine series, serious side effects are rare.

Check Your Kids Treats Homemade is not preferred. Parents are advised to only allow children to eat candy that has been pre-packaged by a reputable manufacturer. Check wrapped treats for signs of tampering. Throw away anything that is discolored, has tiny pinholes or that has a torn wrapper. Illegal drugs may be made look like popular candy brands; these are known as \"look-alikes.\" If you suspect your child's candy contains illicit or illegal substances, call your local police department. Pets like candy too. Many candy items, including chocolate, are poisonous to pets. Use this as a chance to teach children about pet safety and the need to properly store candy. Lock your stock. Locked medicine cabinets keep look-alike prescriptions and over-the-counter medications away from children who can easily mistake them for candy. If your child has a food allergy, check the label to ensure the allergen isn't present. Do not allow the child to eat any home-baked goods he or she may have received. If you have very young children, be sure to remove any choking hazards such as gum, peanuts, hard candies, or small toys. Call the Poison Control Hotline (1-800-222-1222) to report any incidents and receive trained medical advice. Officials also recommend putting the number in all family cell phones as well as programming it as a speed dial number on landlines and posting the number near house phones. Medical professionals including physicians, registered nurses and pharmacists offer confidential advice on poison emergencies, poison prevention, drug information, food poisoning, animal bites and more. They are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Trick-or-Treating Healthy Reminders Stay home if you're sick and stay away from those who are ill. Children shouldn't snack on treats from their goody bags while they're out trick- or-treating. Give them a light meal or snack before they head out - don't send them out on an empty stomach. Urge them to wait until they get home and let you inspect their loot before they eat any of it. Prepare your trick-or-treater with trick-or-treat safety items: a flashlight, reflective tape or strips applied to costumes and candy bags, and an emergency contact information card in case they get lost or separated from the group. Trick or treat as part of a large group with a responsible adult. Walk on sidewalks whenever possible, or on the far edge of the road facing traffic to stay safe. Look both ways before crossing the street at a crosswalk or intersection. Walk, don't run between houses to avoid trips and falls. Keep your hands clean by using hand sanitizer. If you're giving out candy, wash your hands frequently. Never take candy from strangers. Parents should only allow kids to go to homes in which they know the residents. Costumes Do not wear decorative contact lenses without a prescription. Decorative lenses purchased without a prescription may not fit properly, leaving the eye more susceptible to scratches on the outer layer of the eye, or getting an ulcer (an open sore) on the cornea\u2014the clear covering over the front of the eye. Painting your face can be a fun alternative to wearing a mask. Test novelty makeups in a small area on the arm to test for an allergic reaction before applying it to your face. Remove all makeup according to the manufacturers' instructions before bedtime to prevent possible skin and eye irritation. Make sure costumes fit well to avoid blocked vision and help prevent trips and falls. Choose costume accessories that are short, soft, and flexible. Choose items that are made of materials such as plastic or foam.
