WISE Mindfulness Hour The Rural Health Equity Track prepares residents to be leaders in improving rural health care. Through a customizable community focus and emphasis on health equity, RHET pre- pares residents for rural practice and rural health advocacy. The program facilitates rural rotations and resident engagement in rural Wisconsin commu- nities. RHET residents gain skills to help patients with needs that otherwise might go unmet in rural communities, such as medication assisted thera- py (MAT) for opioid addic- tion. The Rural Health Equity Track provides added val- ue to the traditional Madi- son residency by incorpo- rating rural health and leadership experiences into the scheduled curricu- lum. RHET residents have their continuity clinic at our rural Belleville prac- tice. In addition, RHET residents complete more rural rotations than the standard Madison resident and receive specific train- ing on mental health and addiction issues in rural communities. RHET resi- dents participate regularly in a rural free clinic and rural critical access hospi- tal work in the R2 and R3 years. These rural rota- tion experiences and com-munity involvement give RHET residents an oppor- tunity to target and train for a specific rural Wiscon- sin community for future practice. Additionally, RHET residents are fund- ed and scheduled to at- tend the national meeting of the National Rural Health Association (NRHA) for two of the three years. The RHET's leadership curriculum deepens the residents' understanding of rural health issues and ave- nues for improving rural health and rural health care as well as connects the residents with mentors and organizations that further their lifelong in- volvement as rural health advocates. Residents in the Rural Health Equity Track fully participate in the Madison residency curriculum, which emphasizes broad skills, including OB, ICU care, and strong elective options. They attend the same didactic sessions and participate in rotations through St. Mary's, UW, and Meriter Hospitals. Two resident physicians join the RHET each year through a post -match se- lection process . House Calls would like to gradu- ates, Kelsey Schmidt and Karen Cecele , for providing this article.

Family Medicine, Belleville, WI Kelsey Schmidt, MD. Family Medicine, Belleville, WI MEDICAL STUDENT SUPPORT FUND The Medical Student Support Fund provides limited financial support when medical students need assistance with unexpected emergency expenses. Permissible expenses include, but are not limited to, travel costs related to death or serious illness in imme- diate family, medication or other health costs not covered by insurance, safety needs or need to replace essential personal belongings due to theft, fire, or natural disaster. Amounts will generally not exceed $500 and are subject to fund availability. Obtain an application by contacting studentservices@med.wisc.edu . A Committee will review the application. Students will be notified within 7 business days of submitting the ap- plication. Applicants must be incoming or enrolled medical students and must have temporary financial hardship resulting from an emergency situation, accident or an- other unexpected critical incident. Medical students often won- der how to achieve balance as they lead professional lives, maintain relationships with professional significant others, and manage daily lives that include children, hobbies, and paying the bills. On Wednesday, November 15th from 5:30 -7:00pm , Student Services will host dinner and rotating panel discussions that address your questions about profes- sional balance. Panels will include experts; more importantly, panels will include a variety of physi- cians, from recent grads to well-established doctors, who will bring a diverse ar- ray of personal experience to the room. Significant oth- ers will accompany our pan- el members; significant oth- ers of our medical students are welcome to attend. Sessions are: Specialty Choice and Work/Life Balance : focused on demands of different spe- cialties and how people find balance between their spe- cific specialty responsibilities and personal lives. An intro-duction to Careers in Medi- cine career planning tools will be included. Time and Money : is focused on life outside of work and medicine. Where do people find time to spend on them- selves and/or with loved ones while also managing finances to pay medical school debts, raise children, own, a home, etc. RSVP is required and will include both on -site and dis- tance participation. Watch your email for your invitation!

Resilience is \"rebounding\" but at some point you some- times don't rebound as much as you once did. You're on a teeter totter, so you have to find balance. You're on a roller coaster; sometimes you just have to hang on. Understand more about \"why am I doing this?\" and \"why will I put myself through this again and again?\" Recognize when you're not rebounding. Resilience requires a strong scaffold. The scaffold is you, your colleagues, your friends and family who are all part of what holds you up and supports you. Diversification keeps you strong. And here are just a few things that our students shared and discussed about what gives them satisfaction and keeps them \"doing this again and again.\" 5-minute journal on gratitude.

RETURN TO MAIN PAGE NRMP Match Calendar Begins The main residency registra- tion deadline for the NRMP Match is 11/30 at 11:59pm EST. Even if you are partici- pating in the SF Match (for ophthalmology) or the Urolo- gy match, you should still register as you will use the NRMP match to secure your PGY -1 position. The only students who do not need to register are those participat- ing in the military match and those who are not planning to begin residency in 2018 or not graduating this aca- demic year. If you have questions or concerns about the match process, please contact Student Services or your House Mentor. We're committed to supporting you find the set of residency pro- gram options that best fit your career goals. RETURN TO MAIN PAGE For some people, meeting a request for accommodations seems obvious\u2014they are using a cane or wheelchair and certain accessibility is required. People who live with conditions that are not visible to the eye face particular chal- lenges at school, work, and in the com- munity. This becomes particularly acute in medical school where, due to per- ceived competition, students may be reluctant to request accommodations even though they will someday treat patients with a variety of conditions and disabilities requiring accommodations. The following text is excerpted from National Pub- lic Radio's People With 'Invisible Disabilities' Fight For Understanding . Carly Medosch, 33, seems like any other young professional in the Washington, D.C. area \u2014 busy, with a light laugh and a quick smile. She doesn't look sick. But she has suffered from Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel condition, since she was 13. There have been times, she says, when she's \"been laying on the floor in the bathroom, kind of thinking, 'Am I going to die? Should I jump out in front of traffic so that I can die?' Because you're just in so much pain.\" More re- cently, she was diagnosed with fibrom- yalgia, a condition that leaves her in a state of full -body chronic pain and in- tense fatigue. For Medosch and others who struggle with an invisible disability, occasional hospital stays and surgeries are not the hard part. Mundane, everyday activities can be more difficult. \"Washing my hair, blow -drying my hair, putting on makeup \u2014 those kind of activities can exhaust me very quickly,\" says Medosch. Walking to the subway or even bending down to pick something up can take a lot out of her. But that isn't apparent from the outside. \"I kind of call it being able to pass,\" she says. \"So I can pass as a nor- mal, healthy, average person,... especial- ly in interactions with strangers, getting your foot in the door in a situation like a job in- terview.\" It is hard to pinpoint the num- ber of Americans with an invisible disa- bility, but it's estimated there are mil- lions. Their conditions may range from lupus to bipolar disorder or diabetes. The severity of each person's condition var- ies, and the fear of stigma means that people often prefer not to talk about their illnesses. \"You know, it's that invisible nature of an illness that people don't understand,\" says Wayne Connell, the founder and head of the Invisible Disabilities Associ- ation . He started the group after his wife was diagnosed with Lyme disease and multiple sclerosis. \"We'd park in disabled parking and she didn't use a wheelchair or a cane, and so people would always give us dirty looks and scream at us,\" he recalls. \"When they see someone in a wheelchair, OK, they get that they're in a wheelchair. But what if they have chronic pain, what if they have PTSD \u2014 anything from cancer to peripheral neuropathy to autism?\" When a disability isn't immediately obvi- ous, others \u2014 at work, school or even at home \u2014 sometimes doubt it exists and accuse those who suffer from invisible conditions of simply angling for special treatment. Medosch says she's comfortable being vocal about her disability now because she's well protected at her current job. She hopes discussing her own experience will help boost understanding, but acknowledges invisible disability can be hard to fathom \u2014 especially when so many people who live with it seem, out- wardly, at least, to be just like everyone else. At UW SMPH we strive to be inclusive of our entire population\u2014staff, students, faculty, and the patients we are learning to serve. If you are a student in need of accommodations, the information you need is in OASIS Notices>General Information>Disability & Title IX Ser- vices . If you have never experienced the stigma that is often associated with accommodations, then medical school is an excellent time to reflect on wheth- er your approach to this would differ for yourself, or a colleague, than a patient.

We recognize that there is no day or time of the week that will work for all students, so if you are una- ble to attend but you are still inter- ested in group meditation or re- ceiving mindfulness meditation resources, please contact Alec Lerner at aplerner@wisc.edu. Medical education and life as a physi- cian can be stressful. As such, it is es- sential for students and physicians to practice self -care throughout their edu- cation and careers. Mindfulness, cultivated through the regular practice of meditation, is a his-torically and empirically validated meth- od for improving one's well -being, resili- ence, emotional stability, concentration, empathy, and more. While there are certainly other ways to practice self -care, meditation offers a practical and structured method. Also, because we are engaging in group meditation, we will establish an addi- tional wellness -focused community within the UW SMPH. What better way to start each week than with a group mindfulness medita- tion session with your peers? We hope to see many of you on Monday! Watch your email for details!

Rethinking Exercise : Replace punishing workouts with movement that makes you happy In a new study funded internally by the National Cancer Institute, Michelle Segar, director of the University of Michigan's Sport, Health, and Activity Re- search and Policy Center, and co-investigators, analyzed what women say makes them feel happy and successful, and how their expectations and beliefs about exercise foster or undermine those things. Both active and inactive wom- en report the same ingredients for feeling happy and successful: Connecting with and helping others be happy and successful Being relaxed and free of pressures during their leisure time Accomplishing goals of many sorts The study also found that for inactive women, their beliefs and expectations about exercise actually thwarted the things that make them feel happy and successful. One finding indicated that \"The direct conflict between what these low-active women believe they should be doing when they exercise, and their desire to decompress and renew themselves during leisure time, demotivates them,\" Segar said. Exceptions found in the study were among the more active participants, who held more flexible views of exercise...They made exercise more of a \"middle priority,\" which took the pressure off and left room for compromise when sched- ules and responsibilities did not permit planned exercise to occur.

This may result in sub -optimal care for the pa- tient. Research indicates that patients with five or more presenting symptoms, or mental health issues, are less likely to be satisfied and viewed as difficult. Thirty -four people attending GHHS rounds represented medical students, physicians, physical therapy, nurse practitioner, speech -language patholo- gy. And everyone was interested in defining and dealing with the challeng- ing patient. Here's a brief recap of what was discussed: Who is the difficult patient? We were reminded that... The difficult patient isn't necessarily someone who is angry with you. It might be someone who \"knows more\" than the person treating him/her and they demand to have a certain prescription or see a cer- tain type of doctor. Pediatric patients may come with difficult family members. If the pa- tient is non -verbal you might have to trust that the family member knows the patient best and you need to rely on their information. The \"system\" might be the cause of a patient's difficulty\u2014they don't under- stand when, why, or how something is happening to them, or how much it might cost them. However, fear and \"not knowing\" may be the driver of the difficult patient. Difficult patients may receive sub - optimal care because... The physician feels that the patient is wasting their time.The physician will spend less time with the difficult patient. We minimize a patient who is la- beled as difficult in order to avoid dealing with them at a deeper level. Key strategies discussed were... Utilize the skills of the interprofes- sional team to work with these pa- tients. Drawing on different knowledge sets, as well as sharing the burden of a difficult patient, can help the patient to feel \"heard,\" cared for, and receive the optimal care that everyone knows the pa- tient deserves. Ask if the patient is in pain and is that causing their difficulty? Take action to relieve the pain if that helps to improve the interaction. RETURN TO MAIN PAGE GHHS Recap: Challenging Patients: A Team-Based Approach You're Invited to Gold Humanism Honor Society Rounds The Healing Power of Touch Wednesday, November 1st at 6pm in 1244 HSLC A lively discussion with your fellow health professional students about the role of touch in medicine. What is the importance of the physical exam? Is it still relevant? How else do providers use touch to foster therapeutic relationships? Come share your experiences, perspectives, and opinions! Dinner is graciously provided by the WMAA. Watch your email to RSVP. According to a 2011 TEDGlobal Talk , \"A Doctor's Touch,\" modern medicine is in danger of losing a powerful, old - fashioned tool: human touch. This talk presented by Abraham Verghese, M.D., focuses on our era of the patient - as-data-point and Dr. Verghese's belief in the purpose of the old -fashioned physical exam, the bedside chat, and the power of informed observation. In 2016. Dr. Verghese, physician, teacher, and author, received a Nation- al Humanities Medal at the White House from President Barack Obama Dr. Verghese's work as a physician informs his writing and the reflection that comes through his writing helps him empathize with his patients, and to see them individually, as human beings who are suffering, fearful and in need not just of treatment, but of comfort and reassurance. Imagining his patients' experience has driven his work throughout his medical career. His emphasis on empathy and healing is the focus of his talks, nation- ally and internationally, as he stresses the importance of the patient -physician relationship in an era of advances in medical technology that often tend to de-personalize medical care.
