Your dog's liver is a multi purpose important organ. From digestion to blood clotting and removing waste from the body, the liver is an essential part of every living being's vital health. When the liver is compromised it can not only negatively impact the digestive system, but can lead to a build up of dangerous toxins in your dog's body. The liver is ideally situated to detect any dangerous foreign substance in your dog's gut. It is an essential line of defense in the immune system. A healthy liver is important to detect, capture, and clear out bacteria and viruses that can threaten your dog's health. A dog's heart and cardiovascular system are vital and also susceptible to disease and failure. Signs of dog heart disease are dependent upon the type of disease itself and its severity. There are a few main heart conditions that dogs traditionally suffer: - Chronic Valvular Disease: Leaking heart valves reduce the quantity of blood that reaches the rest of the body - Myocardial Disease: Weakening or thickening of the heart muscle results in the heart pumping less efficiently, also known as an enlarged heart - Heart Murmur: Abnormal heart sounds indicating that there is an issue with blood flowing through the heart Meanwhile, a diabetic dog struggles daily with blood sugar levels, due to an imbalance of insulin caused by a defective pancreas. Healthy blood sugar allows for an effective amount of energy to be delivered to the cells in your dog's body. Imagine if there was a natural remedy that could support all these essential systems in your dog's body? What is Dandelion Root? Most of us are familiar with this herb as an annoying weed in the garden, but its use in recorded traditional medicine dates back to the 7th century. Both the leaf and the root are used, although their properties are quite different from each other. The simple dandelion root has some incredible properties including: - Liver support - Digestion (appetite, bile secretion, gas, indigestion) - Cardiovascular support (supporting the liver is important in cases of heart disease - Blood sugar maintenance - Immune support (supports normal responses to viral infections) What is Dandelion Root used for? Liver: Supporting your dog's liver can go a long way in contributing to a long and healthy life, even if your dog is not showing signs of liver problems.The liver performs dozens of different functions in the body, yet liver disease (including cirrhosis) is one of the most common health problems in older canines. It can damage all functions of the dog's liver, with very harmful health effects. Even dogs without liver disease may need support to metabolize and excrete prescription medications and environmental chemicals which are often damaging to the liver. Digestive System: Dandelion Root can support normal bile flow during digestion to help the breakdown and assimilation of foods. Dandelion Root supports the production of liver enzymes that metabolize toxins in the body so they can be flushed out through the excretory system. It also supports the gut by providing a high percentage of inulin. Inulin is a prebiotic that helps maintain healthy flora that is so important for good digestion and the immune system. Heart: Dandelion Root has certain properties to help maintain normal blood pressure and good circulation. It is also high in several minerals that contribute to a good electrolyte balance. A well-functioning liver is important for dogs with heart disease. Blood Sugar: Dandelion root has also been studied for its ability to support normal, healthy insulin levels. The addition of Dandelion root to your dog's health regime is a great way to help maintain stable blood sugar levels. "}
