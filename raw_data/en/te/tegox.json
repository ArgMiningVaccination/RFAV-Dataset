Summary This report describes a participatory impact assessment of a community-based animal health project implemented by Vete rinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF) and Church of Uganda Dioceses Development Office (CoU-TEDDO) in Malera and Ongino Sub Counties (in Kumi District), in Eastern Uganda. This was a pilot project designed to improv e primary veterinary services in the region. The impact assessment focused on the effects of Community-based Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) on the incidence of livestock diseases and the activities of CAHWs as compared to other animal health service providers. The Veterinarios Sin Fronter as funded project trained a total of 32 CAHWs, two per parish (since both Ongino and Malera have eight parishes each). The study sampled 32 different villages, wher e one paravet was trained, and used participatory methods such as semi st ructured interviews, \"Before and After\" proportional pilling, mappings, quality ranking and matrix scoring. Community perception of CAHWs as service providers Despite sharing a common boundary, the realit y is quite different in the two sub counties. In Ongino, the most valued animal health service provider is the Veterinary Officer (VO). The communities valued easy accessibility and the quality of his knowledge and drugs. But in affo rdability and trust, CAWHs are the best service providers. The percepti on of rest of the veterinary agents is next to nothing, since they fall far behind these two. In Malera, the VO is too far to offer adequate service. There is also a private veterinarian who is well respected. However, it is the CAHWs who are by far the most preferred agents by the inhabitants of the Sub County. Not only is their service more accessible due to the close proximity, but also livestock keepers were able to rapidly respond to disease outbreaks and t he recovery rate was perceived to be high. However, CAHWs as compared to the Animal Husbandry Officer and Veterinary officer were unable to treat all the entire spectrum of diseases. Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 6Impact on livelihood In the impact assessment area, we can find two type of different disease, epizootic and endemic. In the epizootic diseases, veterinary services have direct consequences with the number of ill animals, as opposed to endemic diseases, where the number of sick animals can remain the same despite improving veterinary services (although the number of deaths will decrease). Therefore, as this study reflects the pattern of diseas es affecting animals (disease incidence), we should expect changes in the epizootic dis eases, but not in the endemic ones. In the case of cattle, in both areas, we find an important reduct ion in the number of animals affected by CBPP (epizootic diseas e) as a result of work done by the veterinary services (mainly by the VO in Ongino and CAHWs in Malera) and a moderate increase of worms and ECF (endemic disease) in areas where we do not have information on the evolution of the animal death rate. The same does not apply in the case of goats. The unequal evolution of different epizootic diseases will not allow us to draw conclusions about the direct effect of the CAHWs' work. But in general, the impact of the CAHWs services have been visibly perceived by the beneficaries in the impr ovement in the health of their animals and this has resulted in increased income opporunity (p revention is cheaper than treatment). Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 7 2. Introduction The Participatory Impact Assessment of CAHWs was carried out between the months of February and October 2004, in the Sub counties of Malera and Ongino in Kumi District. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of CAHWs in the communities of those Sub Counties. The exercise was carried out by the local organization Church of Uganda Teso Dioce ses Development Office (CoU-TEDDO) and Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF), a Spanish NGO. While both organisations provided the field officers to carry out the study and the data compilation, the analysis and final report production was done by the latter (VSF). VSF has been working in the Teso sub-region, of which Kumi District is part of, for the last 10 years. It has been implementi ng a Restocking Programme in the sub- region, through the provisi on of animals on credit and th rough the improvement of the animal management techniques of the co mmunities (all of this through local partner organisations), inside the ani mal management component, VSF has been training CAHWs in the different Sub Counties. It has done this through local partners and with the consent of the local veterinary aut horities like the District Veterinary Officers (DVO). The follow- up of the CAHWs activities has been constant, both by the local partners and VSF, but there has never been a study carried out on the impact of the CAHWs on the communities they serve. The incursion of Lord's Resistance Army (L .R.A.) in the north of the Teso Region affected Kaberamaido District, where VSF had been training its first CAHWs in 1998. The study would have been more re levant there, since a long-term perspective on CAHW work would have giv en a better picture of their impact. But due to this instability, the study was mov ed to safer areas in Kumi District. In February 2002, VSF started f unding part of the Food Secu rity Programme of CoU- TEDDO. One of the activities funded was training of CAHWs in the four Sub Counties of the Programme, two of which were Malera and Ongino in Kumi District. Similarly, since CoU-TEDDO has a large number of field officers, compared with other VSF local partners, t he study could be carried out in two Sub Counties, which had a population of 54,268 1 in 2002. 1 Ugandan 2002 Population and Housing Census Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 8 Study area As mentioned earlier the areas of study were the Sub Counties of Malera and Ongino on the north-eastern part of Kumi District, bordering the Karamoja region. The district forms part of the Teso- Lango Farming System, with a combination of crop and livestock activities. It is situated in the eastern part of Uganda close to the Kenyan border (see figure 2). The traditional ethnic group of the ar ea are the Iteso, of a pastoralist Nilotic origin, who se ttled in the area ar ound 400 years ago, and adopted agriculture. Figure 1: Map of Kumi District (Ongino and Malera Sub Counties are highlighted) The neigh boring of Malera and Ongino are very similar in appearance. They have the same number of parishes (eight), si milar populations around 27,000, and similar population densities. But there are some significant results of this study. Ongino: is the most northern Sub County of the two, it is limited by Katakwi District on the north, Nakapiripit District (f ormerly part of Moroto District) in the east, Kumi and Atutur S ub Counties in the west and Malera Sub County in the south. It is also close to t he district headquarters, Kumi town (pop. 8,367) which has the local government offices, including the District Veterinary Office, and the drug veterinar y shops. Moreover, communications Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 9between Kumi town and Ongino are quite fluid since the district hospital is located in the latter, a mere 16 kilometres from the town centre. Malera: is limited by Ongino Sub Count y in the north, Nakapiripit and Sironko Districts in the east, Kolir and Bukedea Sub Counties on the south and Atutur Sub County in the west. In Malera Trading Centre (see figure 1), where the Sub County offices are, ther e is an important cattle market. Since Kumi town is far, a private veterinar ian has set up an office within the sub county. Figure 2: Map of Uganda (Kumi District is highlighted) Community-based Animal Health Workers A total of 32 CAHWs were trained in Malera and Ongino during the period VSF funded CoU-TEDDO's Food Security Programme. The explanation behind the number of CAHWs comes from the experience of their training organisations in the Teso sub-region (Christian Veterinary Mission, VSF,...), of having two CAHWs per parish. Since both Ongino and Malera have eight parishes each, this gave the total number of 32. These CAHWs were trained duri ng four training sessions of one week each, the first in September 2002 and the last in February 2004, just before this study started. However, as the initial date for the study was very close to the last two weeks of training it was difficult to appreciate any effect or impact of the incidence of these diseases due to the CAHWs work's. For this reason we think that it is important to Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 10list all the illness with the m onth of the training to clar ify any possible doubts.

This was to ensure that the CAHWs were trusted and accept ed by the people in each community. The only prerequisites established by CoU-TEDDO were that they should be able to read and write in English and that women were to be encouraged to apply. The first prerequisite was so that they would be able to read the labels on the drug bottles, thus avoiding any misdosage. Furthermore these CAHWs would be expected to hand in reports of every service they ca rried out, and that these should be done in English. As for the second prerequisite, co mmunities finally only chose men. From all the candidates presented for trai ning CoU-TEDDO accepted them all.

Before this study started, a three day workshop was organised at the Medical Centre Training Facility in Soroti town. The aim of the workshop was to get all the participant involved in this study acquainted with each other and to establish how this study would be carried out. At the end of the workshop, the study was structured into four parts \u0083 Personal interviews : With the university or college trained Animal Health Workers operating in the area to know their opinion on the existence of trained CAHWs and of the quality and necessity of the work they were doing. \u0083 Mappings : To determine the distribution of the different veterinary services available in the communities, their distance to the area, and the price of their services (not only the services, but also the cost of getting to them). \u0083 Matrix scoring : To have a comparative evaluation by the communities in the area on a series of issues, such as quality, access to the service, etc, for each one of the animal health service providers working in the area. Similarly a ranking stating the relevance of these items was made, to find out, for the future, which should be the characteristics of future trainings of existing CAHWs or future CAHWs operating in the area. \u0083 Proportional pilling : To look at the incidence of animal diseases for the two types of animals kept in the study areas (namely, cattle and goats), between the time that CAHWs were not present and the time they were fully operational. The aim of this analysis was to look at the influence of different factors on this evolution (one of the factors being the arrival of trained CAHWs). There are a total of 32 communities in two Sub Counties, 15 in Ongino and 17 in Malera (see annex 1: List of communities in the study) and they were all taken into the study. During the workshop the sample study and the number of times to be made for each Participatory Rural Appraisal, tools to collect information, were also determined (see table 1: Summary of the Methodology). Also those diseases, which more commonly affected cattle and goats, were listed to be used in the proportional pilling. Similarly it was important to check which animal health Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 12professionals worked in the district and the list of qualitative items that would determine the quality of their service. In a subsequent meeting held in March this year, the lists made during the workshop were compared with the reality on the field, and a series of definitive lists were made. During this meeting, the field officers were also retrained on the PRA methods they would implement in the field. Table1: Summary of the Methodology.

Proportional pilling Groups of between 3 and 7 people 145 (60 in Ongino and 85 in Malera) To determine the list of diseases for the study and to check the degree of implementation of the skills learned by the field officers in the workshop, a trial run was carried out in three randomly chosen communities. With the analysis of this information, it was decided that the following information would be used: Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 13 List of diseases for cattle and goats: Cows Goats Worms Worms on the study: Accessibility Animal heath advice Drugs available Can treat all the animal problems Drug quality Affordability Recovery after the visit Trustworthy Support of these services in the communities Type of animal health service provider: Private veterinarian Government veterinarian Traditional Healer Quack Community-based Animal Health Worker Factors which influence disease evolutions on cattle and goats: Water Pastures Other vet. care Instability Community-based Animal Health Worker \u0083 Revision of the test questionnaires done and correction of the methodological errors. Once all the processes had finished, a workplan to visit the communities was developed (see annex 1: Communities work plan) Problems with some parishes. When the data was analyzed, it was discovered that in two of the communities, no Community-based Animal Health Worker had ever worked there (these were Kakori (in Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 14Malera) and Kongura (in Ongino)). This means that the CAHWs trained for those communities never took on the job. Faced with this situation, three alternatives for data analysis were available. The three options were: \u0083 A comparative analysis between those communities, which had operating CAHWs and those, that did not. \u0083 Analysis without these two communities. \u0083 To carry out the analysis with all the 29 communities studied (although the total number of communities is 32, 3 of them were used for testing). The first alternative was almost immediately discarded, because the sample of communities without a CAHW was far too small, to extract any conclusions. Moreover this was not the aim of the initial study, and it would suppose an increase in the sample, with its time and budgetary implications. Having discarded one, there were still two possibilities remaining. But taking into account that the overall objective of the present study was to analyse the effects of Community- based Animal Health Workers , the two communities were finally removed from the analysis, and the remaining 27 communities would be those analysed. Similarly a second set of options appeared before the analysts, which was whether to study both Sub Counties together or separately. Because of the reasons presented in the introduction of this report (in 1.2 Study area), and after seeing the data results on the Matrix Scoring (high differences between the two Sub Counties), it was finally decided to study both Sub Counties separately, Ongino with eleven communities and Malera with sixteen (see annex 3: Joint analysis of the Matrix Scoring).

Results 4. 1 Mapping analysis To understand the reality of the communities when they are evaluating the veterinary services used, it is essential to understand the situation of these in the community, in terms of distance, cost and waiting (often this is crucial depending on the type of disease the animals have). In the case of Ongino Sub County, the local service providers (Quacks, CAHWs and traditional healers) are the closest to the communities and their distance and travel costs are cheaper (see table 2: Information on the situation of veterinary services in the Sub Counties). But if you compare them with t he government veterinarian, the difference is minimal, since it only takes them 10 minutes to reach his office. The negative point for the trained CAHWs, the consequences of which will be analysed later, is the time the livestock keeper must wait for this person to arrive, on average seven hours, while the government veterinarian only takes three hours. At the same time, the price difference is not very high, this is why the livestock keepers consider the second one more affordable (see next section).

Although the CAHWs are further away than the quacks or traditional healers, they still offer faster service, taking only one hour to reach the client, while the rest take on average between seven and thirteen hours to arrive. (see table 2: Information on the situation of veterinary services in the Sub Counties). Similarly, although the travel costs are higher, the cost of the actual service is the second lowest of all the service providers, with a great gap between those service providers with higher education. This is why, as it shall be seen later, that the CAHWs are very well valued by the livestock keepers in the area (see next section). Figure 3 Mapping examples in one of the communities in Malera Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 17 4. 2 Matrix Scoring Analysis When the communities made the selection of veterinary service providers in the pilot test done in three communities, it was thought that it would be interesting to carry out two types of comparisons with the CAHWs. On one side, the comparison could be made with the veterinary service providers with tertiary education, both public and private, with a degree or a diploma and on the other, with the traditional local veterinary service providers, such as quacks or traditional healers. For this reason in the section 3.3.2 Matrix Scoring Analysis in Ongino Sub County and 3.3.3 Matrix Scoring Analysis in Malera Sub County , a double focus was carried out: first, the overall situation of all the veterinary service providers in the Sub Counties; and secondly a comparison between the CAHWs and the remaining service providers in the two groups mentioned above. 4. 2. 1.Rank Analysis In spite of the decision taken on the analysis methodology just mentioned, in the case of the rank analysis of the characteristics, the analysis has been done in both Sub Counties separately and as a whole. The reason for this is that these characteristics do not depend directly on the veterinary services available in the area, and it was good to have a global picture of the whole study area. The results, as predicted, did not differ greatly between the Sub Counties, as it can be seen on Table 3: Ranking of the characteristics per Sub County and as a whole , but there are still some differences. In both cases the most important characteristic is accessibility, referring to the proximity to the veterinary service. It must be noted that the communication systems in the area were quite poor and limited, with little chance of movement if unless by bicycle or on foot. Where we start to note differences is with the second characteristic, and this is demonstrated in the total ranking. There is a draw in the relative importance of a service provider having the drugs to treat the animals, or that these are of good quality. It is also important to highlight the importance in the recovering of the animal after the visit from the service provider, as well as the advic e that he/she can give to the livestock keepers on the health of their animals. Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 18The characteristics which are not very relevant are: the trust that the service providers inspire, their affordability, and the amount of knowledge that they have on animal health issues. In a brief summary, the communities are looking for someone with easy accessibility and who can offer council regarding on animal health and, if necessary, for them to be available whenever a visit is necessary and to dispens e the necessary treatment to do emergent \"house calls\" and dispense treatment when needed. Table 3: Ranking of the characteristics per Sub County and as a whole Characteristics Ongino Malera Total Accessibility 1st 1st 1st Drugs available 4th 2nd 2nd Drug quality 2nd 3rd 2nd Recovery after the visit 3rd 5th 4th Support of these services in the communities 5th 7th 6th Animal heath advice 5th 4th 5th Can treat all the animal problems 8th 6th 7th Affordability 7th 8th 8th Trustworthy 9th 9th 9th Kendall Coefficient 0.695 *** 0.593 *** 0.597 *** The number of participating groups is 27 (16 in Malera Sub County and 11 in Ongino Sub County); the Kendall coefficient of concordance (* p<0.1; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001) with values between 0 and 1 (the higher the value, the closer the opinions are between the groups). 4. 2. 2 Ongino Matrix Scoring Looking at the results shown on table 4: Summary of the Matrix Scoring in Ongino , the most valued veterinary service provider in the Sub County is the District Veterinary Officer, followed closely by the CAHWs and the other traditional service providers. Since there are no private veterinarians in the Sub County, the closest being that one of Malera, the value given to this type of service provider is almost nonexistent. Moving deeper into the data analysis, we can see that the most accessible services (the characteristic with the highest priority) are the traditional service providers (including the CAHWs) and not the DVO. A similar result appears when looking at the affordability of these service providers; which in turn coin cides with the data extracted from the mapping analysis, where in Ongino Sub County, the tr aditional service providers charge an average of 1,500 UShs per service while a service from the district official is more than twice the Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 19price (3,300 UShs) 3. When the government veterinarian is compared with the trained CAHWs, it is seen than if the two previously mentioned characteristics are removed, the latter has a comparatively better image at communi ty level, except for the level of trust which is the same for both. These differences are important and the CAHWs have a long way to go to gain the same value as the DVO. Despite this, the position of the CAHWs, in comparison with the rest of the traditional service providers, is good. The CAHWs are the agents who inspire more trust in the cattle keepers, and have access to better quality drugs. They also give out better advice and the results of their visits are positive and valued. Table4: Summary of the Matrix Scoring in Ongino Private vet. Governmen t vet.

The number of spots represents t he median (the bigger the number of spots, the stronger the relationship bet ween the item and the specific service provider; therefore a low number of spots r epresents a weak relationship). 4. 2. 3 Malera Matrix Scoring The reality in Malera Sub County is completely different from that of Ongino, and it is not only due to its strategic and geographic location with its obvious consequences on the accessibility of the government veterinary official as mentioned earlier, but also on the opinion the communities have of their CAHWs. With great contrast these are very highly valued by the cattle keepers, followed by the private veterinarian in the Sub County, and finally at a great distance, by the remaining traditional service providers. As for the characteristics needed, the CAHWs are more valued in all of them except for the capacity to treat all illnesses and in the access and distribution of good quality drugs, aspects in which the private veterinarian obtains a better mark (see table 5: Summary of the Matrix Scoring in Malera) The main difference between the CAHWs and the private veterinarian, is that the first are community-based and community conscious, therefore being more accessible and more affordable. As for the more theoretical aspects, it is true that the trained CAHWs lack knowledge and are therefore not able to treat all diseases. But at the level of the community, these differences are not large, thus signifying that the CAHWs are performing their duties well and meeting their expectations. When comparing the CAHWs with the rest of the traditional service providers, the cattle keepers have a better opinion of them. Even w hen it is a more expensive service (by 500 shillings), the affordability is still better valued with CAHWs since they provide a better ratio between quality and price.

There are two factors that have been ment ioned because they can and have affected the disease evolution: Type of diseases : we can classifiy the list of the studied diseases in two different groups: \u0083 Epizootic diseases: they are pathological processes which frequency is not constant through the time in the animal population. In them the enviromental factors have effects but mainly a good veterinary services (vaccination, isolation of sick animals, trainings to the owners on well animal management and health problems detection) can reduce the number of sick animals and at the same time reduce the impact, and therefore, the number of cattle deaths. \u0083 Endemic diseases: these diseases effect the flock in the areas constantly on the time, with a similar number of the impacted animals and they depend mainly on environmental factors and for this reason the work of the veterinary services will not reduce the number of sick animals although their work will reduce the impact (good deworming, good alimetation,...) and therefore, the number of cattle deaths. The main objective of the study is not the analysis of the increase or decrease of the animal death rate, but on the impact of the diseases two years ago and at the begining of 2004 in every kind of species. Theoretically we should only see reductions in those which are epizootic diseases, because it depends directly on the service of the veterinary agents in the region. The classification of the diseases not only depends of the nature of it, but also on environmental factors and the location of the animals population. For example in the case of Trypanosomiasis, usually considered epizoot ic, the study\u00b4s area should be considered endemic because Lake Bissinia and its swamps bordering with the two Sub Counties. Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 23It is therefore important to distinguish all the diseases analysed as endemic or epizootic: Training calendar : as we have mentionned in the introduction of, the training session were carried out during the months of September 2002, February 2003 and January 2004. Since the last training was carried out barely two months before the study, this little time-frame does not allow us to study the effects of CAHWs on the diseases explained during that session (January 2004). The results between the two Sub Counties do not vary much, but the work carried out by the CAHWs has been markedly different in these two areas.

There are three diseases which have had great variations during the study time period, as we can see on Graph 1: Evolution of cattle diseases in Ongino Sub County ; the others maintain themselves or suffer little variations. On the positive side it can be seen that Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) has diminished considerably (by over 40%). The government action and the Veterinary Officer of Ongino have been the main cause of this evolution. At the same time, the CAHWS\u00b4 contribution has been important, and despite the fact that they cannot treat, their quick tips to governmental organizations have allowed them to head off some spurts of this disease (see Table 6: Causes in the evolution of cattle diseases in Ongino Sub County ). On the negative side, we can see that both Worms and East Coast Fever (ECF) have increased by 33%. In the case of worm s, different environmental factors have influenced this evolution i.e., overexploitation of the pasture, bad quality of the water sources used and bad rotation of the pasture areas. But there is one important factor which had a decisive impact on this disease: the existence of Liver Fluke, an internal parasite which transmit the illness only to the cattle and which \"live\" in larvae stage in a host in the swamps near the lake, where a large percentage of the animals of the area go to drink. Due to this reason, plus a real lack of drinkable water for the animals the control of this disease became very complicated. Finally, another reason was the bad rotation of the kraals, which has an important influence on the transmission of worms. The peasants do not clean them and the internal parasites survive on the dung, facilitating the transmission. In the case of ECF, the bad quality of the pastures plus their poor rotation meant that the vector (ticks) survived longer and continued to affect the animals. Another reason that help to explain this increase, is that two years ago, the peasants set fire to the pastures during the dry season, eliminating all the ticks and worms existing on it and therefore eliminating the risk factors of infection. But since 2003, the Ugandan Government forbade this practice making it illegal. Therefore, one of the traditional systems of diseases control was eliminated. Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 25Despite that the fact these two diseases are endemics, and will be always there, the veterinary services have an important role in the control and prevention of them. They have to advise and train the farmers about the consequences of the bad kraal rotation and the bad quality of the swamp water and their effects. At the same time, some preventive treatments (deworming every thr ee months, external desparasitation,...) should be practiced. Finally, in the case of Ringworm, the action of the veterinary service, although poor and limited, has been essential in the reduction of the impact of this disease. Two years ago, there was no campaign of dissemination or eradication of it, but now they have started to identify, diagnose and treat. Hopefully in the following years, if the veterinary services continue with this program there will be a marked reduction in Ringworm.

Water Pasture Other Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 264.3.2 Cattle Proportional Pilling in Malera. The evolution of the diseases in this Sub County is slightly more balanced than in Ongino Sub County; but even here it is seen that the diseases that have evolved the most, are still the same three (CBPP, ECF and worms). We can see this on Graph 2: Evolution of cattle diseases in Malera Sub County . In the case of reductions, we can find CBPP, with a decrease of 30%. The factors of this evolution are exactly the same as that in Ongino. The role played by the veterinary services, mainly the private veterinarian (for reasons of accessibility to vaccines), has been important to this reduction. It hoped that the CAHWs' role will be decisive in the maintenance of this reduction in the following years. With experience and time to act (we cannot forget that they received the training on January 2004), their quick tips to the veterinary services with diplomas will allow time to head off spurts of these diseases. On the negative side, we can see that both ECF and worms have had a more moderate increase than neighbouring Sub County (26% and 11% respectively). The reason are exactly the same as that in the bordering Sub County, but in Malera, the role of the veterinary services, and especially the CAHWs have been decisive in controlling the incidence of ECF and Worms (see table 7: Causes in the evolution of cattle diseases in Malera Sub County ). It is important to emphasize the work done by the CAHWs in the Sub County, because beneficiaries attributed to them, on average, more than 25% of the causes (a majority of them, positive ones). Graph 2: Evolution of cattle diseases in Malera Sub t Note: these results are from the study of 5 groups of people (between 3 and 7 members) in the 16 communities of the sub county. Participatory Impact Assessment of t he Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 27 4.3.3 Goat Proportional Pilling in Ongino. The degree of incidence of diseases relating to goats in Ongino Sub County is practically constant in time (see Graph 3: Evolution of goat diseases in Ongino Sub County ). It can be seen that there are small increases in abortions, Anaplasmosis, CCPP and Worms, but the most important result is the fall in the incidence of Mange and ORF (by 38% and 33% respectively). Mange is a disease caused by external parasites, usually ticks. All the veterinary services in the region have worked to controlled this through antiparasite treatments and as a consequence Mange has been reduced. In the case of ORF, again the role of the veterinary agents is important for the reduction. However, the most basic and important role is played by the farmers who need to identify the diseases, start palliative treatment, and then contact with a veterinary agent for further management. For this reason, the farmers should receive training in how identify these diseases and at the same time the CAHWs and other agents need to be available for consultations. In the case of Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP), the life cycle of this is close to Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), and for this reason the role of the veterinary agents is very important. The main difference between the cows and goats, is that a vaccine exists for the cows to prevent the disease but not for goats. As a consequence of this gap, it is very complicated to control the CCPP, and the quick detection and isolation of the sick animal is paramount to control the epidemic spurts. Finally, abortion in the caprine livestock is produced by a bacterium called Brucela Mellitensis. Usually the abortion occurs in the last third of the gestation. It is a disease of infectious character and very common in rural areas like Ongino and Malera. The Table 7: Causes in the evolution of cattle diseases in Malera Sub County Water Pasture Other Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 28small increase in incidence is due to the inability of veterinary service to control the transmission (venereal) and to eliminate the old and infected reproducers. For this reason it is very important that the CAHWs and the other veterinary agents of the area, train and advice the farmers about the best reproductive practices. 4.3.4 Goat Proportional Pilling in Malera. A similar set of results can be found here, in reference to the evolution in the incidence of goat diseases (see Graph 4: Evolution of goat diseases in Malera Sub County ). We can observe that there is a greater fall in the same two diseases, Mange and ORF (42% and 43% respectively); similarly the increases follow the same trend, both CCPP and worms have an increase which is superior to that one of Ongino (25% and 32% respectively, compared to 13% and 20%). Graph 3: Evolution of goat diseases in Ongino Sub County ABORTION project Note: these results are from the study of 5 gr oups of people (between 3 and 7 members) in the 11 communities of the Sub County. Table 8: Causes in the evolution of goat diseases in Ongino Sub County Water Pasture Other Veterinarios Sin Fronteras (VSF - Spain) Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW\u00b4s) in Ongino and Malera (Kumi District), Uganda 29The influencing factors are exactly the same, and the explanation of the situation of caprine livestock in Ongino should serve to understand the behavior of the evolution of the diseases in Malera. For this reason, we expect that the work of the Community Animal Health Workers, in the following years, with a bit more experience and contact with the community, will play an important role in the eradication of the all types of diseases and their environmental impact.

Having examined the project, the assessment t eam would like to recommend the following: \u0083 The service provided by the CAHWs is well considered , and the community people have trust in them . And at the same time, is the service more accessible and they have the support of the beneficiaries. \u0083 CAHWs should received more training , especially in the diseases which they lack knowledge (the capacity of treatment all the diseases is the worst point in their evaluation). \u0083 Is important to remember that the role of all the veterinary agents is not only to operate in the rural villages as a clinic way, but also they have to train and advise the farmers with all of the facts of the diseases in the area, so that they will be able to identy and treat sick animals which will lead to increase and improve production. \u0083 There is a need to work hard to establish a sustainable monitoring and supervision mechanism by the Distric Veterinary Office. \u0083 It has to be considered the CAHWs can fit into the current Governament privatization system (p.e. NAADS privatization process) \u0083 In the pastoralist areas where the Distric Veterinary Officer (DVO) is far away or where the number of cattle is so high for only one professional (for example Malera), other veterinary services, like CAHWs, should be legalized.
