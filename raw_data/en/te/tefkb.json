Caffeine Definition Bitter alkaloid commonly consumed worldwide that is a nervous system stimulant and diuretic found naturally in over 60 different plants includ - ing coffee beans, tea, kola nuts (used to flavor cola), and cacao pods (used to make chocolate products). 9 Caffeine is also produced synthetically for use in foods and drugs.10 The average adult ingests 200 mg daily, but there is no nutritional need for caffeine.10 The caffeine content in 8 oz of com - mon beverages include: coffee, 95-200 mg; black tea, 40-120 mg; and green tea, 15-60 mg. 11 Scientific Findings Caffeine improves mental alertness, prevents fatigue, and may relieve a simple headache, though caffeine withdrawal can cause headache and fatigue. 12 Caffeine is an ergogenic aid that increases work output; it Copyright Taylor & Francis Group. Do Not Distribute.51 Calcium C increases the catabolism of serum free fatty acids and muscle triglycerides to enhance performance.13 Bioactive Dose Doses of 100-250 mg have been used for mental alertness, and 1.6-10 mg/kg has been used for athletic performance. 14 Safety Presumed safe when consumed in normal dietary quantities by nonal - lergic individuals. Tolerance varies by individual; and adverse effects include blunted appetite, headache, dizziness, nervousness, irritability, and dependence. Tolerance varies by individual, but amounts greater than 250-300 mg per day have been associated with tachyarrhythmias and sleep disturbances. Elevation in blood pressure may occur with acute caffeine consumption: in six studies of hypertensive adults, 200-300 mg of caffeine raised blood pressure by 3 to 12 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 3 to 4 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure; two other studies reported an unclear effect of habitual consumption of caffeine on blood pressure. 15 Caffeine's effects in the maternal diet can be summa - rized as follows: caffeine crosses the placenta but is not considered to be a teratogen. Fetal blood and tissue levels are similar to maternal concen - trations. The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption, less than 200 mg/day, has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects. Quantities over 200 mg/day are associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage. Mothers should keep caffeine consumption below 200 mg/day. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 2 cups of coffee or tea. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of maternal serum concentrations, and caffeine is excreted slowly by and may accumulate in infants. Caffeine can cause sleep disturbances, irrita - bility, and increased bowel activity in breastfed infants. 14 Large amounts of caffeine may cause or worsen fibrocystic breast disease.12 Calcium Definition Major mineral found primarily in the skeleton but necessary in the blood and soft tissue for nerve transmission, muscle contraction, blood clot - ting, blood pressure maintenance, and other physiological processes. 16-18 Good sources, in addition to dairy products, include many dark green Copyright Taylor & Francis Group. Do Not Distribute.52 Calcium C vegetables, such as bok choi and broccoli; tofu made with calcium (Ca) sulfate; canned fish with edible bones; and beverages such as Ca-, vitamin D (D)-fortified orange juice, almond milk, rice milk, and soy milk. Scientific Findings Adequate, lifelong Ca and D are associated with optimal bone devel - opment and bone mineral density (BMD); when coupled with physical activity these reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life. 19 An estimate of average intake of all age groups in the US found calcium intake to be below requirements. 20,21 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group. Do Not Distribute.53 Calcium C Source: 26 Some clinical trials and observational studies have found that con - suming the recommended amount of Ca can modestly reduce blood pres - sure in people with or without hypertension.22 Ca may be more effective at lowering blood pressure in salt-sensitive people and those with low baseline dietary Ca intake.14 Dietary Ca intake of 800 mg or more per day (primarily from dairy products) reduced systolic blood pressure up to 4.0 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure up to 2.0 mmHg in four of six studies of adults with hypertension. 23 Obesity often coexists with low Ca and vitamin D intake; however, evidence from randomized clinical tri - als does not support that Ca and vitamin D accelerates weight loss or fat loss in obesity. 24 Higher dietary intakes of Ca have been associated with a decreased risk of metabolic syndrome.25 Bioactive Dose The RDA for Ca is 1,000 mg for 19-50-year-old adults. Safety The UL for Ca for non-pregnant adults aged 19-50 is 2,500 mg. High Ca intake may interfere with the absorption of minerals, and is associ - ated with hypercalcemia and milk-alkali syndrome. 26 High Ca intake Copyright Taylor & Francis Group.

Pregnant women should avoid the medicinal use of caraway oil because it may stimulate menstruation.14 Carbohydrate Definition Macronutrient comprised of single monosaccharides (the simple sugars) or multiple monosaccharides (complex carbohydrate) that is metabo - lized aerobically or anaerobically for energy. Simple sugars are found naturally or may be added to fruit, milk, and grains. Complex carbohy - drate\u2014fiber and starch\u2014is abundant in fruit, vegetables, grains, and legumes. Carbohydrate is not found in meat/poultry /fish/eggs or fats/oils. Inadequate dietary carbohydrate available for metabolism can cause ketogenesis, a condition that most commonly occurs in Type I diabetics; however, glucose can be synthesized from amino acid and triglyceride through gluconeogenesis. Scientific Findings \"Evidence has also shown that replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates reduces blood levels of total and LDL cholesterol but increases blood lev - els of triglycerides and reduces HDL cholesterol. Replacing total fat or saturated fats with carbohydrates is not associated with reduced risk of CVD. Additional research is needed to determine whether this relation - ship is consistent across categories of carbohydrates (e.g., whole versus refined grains; intrinsic versus added sugars), as they may have different associations with various health outcomes.\" 49 The OmniHeart Trial found that replacing some of the carbohydrates in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH diet) with the same amount of either protein or unsaturated fats lowered blood pressure and LDL cholesterol levels more than the original DASH dietary pattern which is high in complex carbohydrate. 48 A case-control study (n = 2 81 women with an incident of polycystic ovarian syndrome [PCOS] and 472 age-matched controls) showed high dietary glycemic index and glycemic load and low fiber intake are significantly associated with the develop - ment of PCOS. 50 See also: Fiber.

Carnitine Definition Also called l -carnitine which is the form found in food, as well as skeletal and cardiac muscle. Dietary sources of carnitine include meats, especially red meats; dairy products; breads; and vegetables. 51 The average adult consumes 60-180 mg of carnitine daily and vegans consume 10-12 mg daily. 50 Healthy people do not need to ingest carnitine because it is nones - sential, that is, made in vivo from lysine and methionine via the liver and kidney in quantities that are probably sufficient to meet daily require - ments, 52 with the exception of certain preterm infants unable to synthe - size sufficient amounts.51 Scientific Findings Carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxi - dation and energy production and transports waste compounds out of the mitochondria. 50 Primary carnitine deficiency is a genetic condition that prevents the body from using certain fats for energy, signs, and symptoms of which typically appear during infancy or early childhood and may include encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, confusion, vomiting, muscle weakness, and hypoglycemia. 50 Bioactive Dose Not known.

C carotenoids have been identified, of which approximately 50 have provita - min A activity.56 Carotenoid sources include fruits, vegetables, and oils.57 Scientific Findings Numerous observational studies have found that people who ingest more carotenoids in their diets have a reduced risk of several chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, age-related macular degenera - tion, and cataract. 56 Major public health benefits could be achieved by increasing consumption of carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables.56 Safety No UL has been established for beta-carotene (or other carotenoids) and no adverse effects except for carotenodermia, the yellow discoloration of the skin, is thought to occur from ingesting excessive amounts of dietary beta-carotene. Carotenodermia is harmless when it occurs due to the intake of food sources of carotenoids. 58 ULs have not been established for carotenoids. Bioactive Dose Not known. Carrot (Daucus carota L.) Definition Root vegetable widely recognized for its role in vision because it is a rich source of provitamin A carotenoids. Vitamin A performs functions essen-tial to the eye and visual process ( see also: Vitamin A ). Carrots are a good source of insoluble fiber, 59 and the purple cultivar is rich in anthocyanins.60 Commonly eaten fresh and as part of processed foods, carrots are among the ten most economically important vegetable crops grown worldwide. 60 Scientific Findings Daucus carota exhibited anticancer and antioxidant activities in laboratory research, and in an experimental study, its oil suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of human colon adenocarcinoma cells. 61 Consumption of carrot juice led to a marked increase in beta-carotene and alpha-caro - tene in fecal markers which in turn showed high dose-dependent cyto - toxic and antiproliferative effects on colon adenocarcinoma cells in a small randomized, crossover-design study (n = 2 2 healthy young men).62 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group.

Cheese is generally high in fat, for example, full-fat feta cheese made from goat's milk is approximately 45% fat. 91 It is a good source of Ca (200 mg, 15% DV per 1-1.5-oz serving), protein, riboflavin, vitamin B12, and potassium, 92 and fermented cheese may or may not con - tain appreciable lactose and/or probiotics. Cheese is not routinely forti - fied with vitamin D except for American cheese and a few others that list \"vitamin D\" in \"ingredients.\" Scientific Findings Cheeses such as aged cheddar, Swiss, blue, Monterey Jack, mozzarella, Brie, Gouda, and American processed can help to prevent cavity forma - tion when consumed with cariogenic foods because their nutrient con - stituents (protein, Ca, and phosphorus) neutralize plaque acids even in the presence of sucrose. 93,94 The cheese-making process changes protein into peptides that possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and analgesic/opioid activity. In addition, these pep - tides can inhibit angiotensin-converting enzymes and produce functional lipids, such as conjugated linoleic acid that has anti-inflammatory, anti - carcinogenic, antimicrobial, hypotensive, diuretic, and vitamin synthetic properties. 95 Bioactive Dose Not known.

Chia seeds are a source of soluble and insoluble fiber (9.8 g total fiber, 35% DV per 1 oz) and supply linolenic acid. Other chia con - stituents include approximately 5 g of protein (10% DV) and 15.6 \u00b5 g of selenium (28% 1 oz; 109 in addition kaempferol, caf - feic acid, and chlorogenic acid.110 Chia seeds were used as an offering to the Aztec gods111 and have a history of use as a medicine, though modern health claims that it reduces risks of cardiovascular heart disease, cogni - tive decline, and cancer111 have not been proven. Scientific Findings A meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials (n = 5 26 healthy subjects) examining chia seed doses ranging from 7 g to > 1 5 g daily found that high doses significantly reduced diastolic (but had no effect on systolic) BP; had mod - est but not clinically significant effects on postprandial blood glucose and HDL cholesterol (and no effect on total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, or VLDL). However, the quality of evidence was low or very low indicating substantial uncertainty about any effects. 111 Using some of the same stud - ies, an earlier meta-analysis of seven clinical trials (six randomized and one nonrandomized n = 2 00), of which five were blinded, found no sta - tistically significant relationship of chia seed consumption on CVD risk factors. 112 An animal study found that chia improved dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in dyslipidemic rats.113 Bioactive Dose Not known.

Broccoli contains 11 \u00b5 g per \u00bd cup; grape juice supplies 8 \u00b5 g per 1 cup; dried basil supplies 2 \u00b5 g per tablespoon; and green beans supply 1 \u00b5g per \u00bd cup. 128 Scientific Findings Chromium may improve insulin sensitivity, which can modify the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). 129 Diabetic men with CVD had lower toenail chromium than healthy control subjects in a cross-sectional analysis comparing men with diabetes only (n = 6 88), diabetes with prevalent CVD (n = 1 98), and healthy control subjects (n = 3 61).129 Bioactive Dose The AI for chromium is 25-35 \u00b5g for adults aged 19-50. Safety No UL has been established for chromium because few adverse events have been reported for excess intake of chromium from food. Cilantro ( Coriandrum sativum ) Definition Herb grown from coriander seeds. Cilantro leaves and stems are chopped and used in Latin, Thai, and other cuisines, for example, freshly chopped or torn and used as the aromatic green herb in salsa, pico de gallo, and the fried noodle and vegetable dish pad Thai. Though nor - mally consumed in insignificant quantities to be an appreciable source of nutrients, cilantro contains vitamins A and K, and contains numerous phytochemicals including caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and limonene 130,131 Coriander has been used in traditional medicine to treat cystitis.132 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group.

Citrus Definition Juicy, segmented fruits of the genus Citrus that are vitamin C- and folate- rich and among the best sources of flavonoids, such as naringenin, hes - peridin, nobiletin, and tangeretin, in addition to others. The skin, peel, and rinds of citrus fruits are rich in essential oils and contain more phyto - chemical compounds on a per gram basis than the edible interior flesh.141 Otherwise inedible fruit peels are consumed, for example, when lemon peel is scraped and added to recipes as lemon \"zest\"; a small piece of lime is twisted to expel its juice and the peel is added to a beverage (lime \"twist\"); or sour orange rind is consumed in marmalade. Citrus rinds con - tain a variety of phytochemicals including carotenoids, flavanone glyco - sides, and flavonoids. 142 Scientific Findings Epidemiological data suggest that frequent consumption of citrus fruits is associated with reduced risk of CVD, cerebral infarction, and ischemic stroke. 143 A systematic review of 22 observational and preclinical stud - ies from 1970 through 2017 , examining the effect of citrus juices on can - cer risk reduction, concluded that the evidence strongly corroborates the role of citrus juices and their derivatives as a potential resource against cancer. 144 Epidemiological, experimental, and limited clinical studies sug - gest constituents in citrus foods, including flavonoids such found in citrus peel,152 has been shown to have anti - atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties.153 A review of ten clini - cal trials examining the effect of citrus juice on markers of blood lipids found weak, but positive, evidence in five of the studies that one or more blood lipids may be positively influenced by consumption of 100% cit - rus fruit juice. 154 In one study, 750 mL of orange juice daily, for 4 weeks, increased HDL cholesterol by 21% and decreased the LDL-to-HDL cho - lesterol ratio by 16% in hypercholesterolemic patients (n = 1 6 healthy men and 9 healthy women with elevated plasma total and LDL cholesterol and normal plasma triglycerides); however, it raised triglycerides by 30%. 155 A dosage of 200 mL of orange juice three times daily (600 mL/d) compared Copyright Taylor & Francis Group.

Consuming citrus or coming into physical contact with citrus peel has resulted in allergic reactions. Citrus flavonoids have low or no cytotoxicity to healthy, normal cells. 158 Clove ( Eugenia caryophyllata ) Definition Spice sourced from an evergreen tree commonly used in fruit-based dishes, such as pumpkin pie and mulled wine (wine to which mulling spices, such as cinnamon and cloves have been added). Clove oil, which contains eugenol, is most popularly known as being a toothache remedy topically; however, according to FDA, efficacy is lacking for this use. In addition to eugenol, other phytochemical components in clove include phenolics. 159 Scientific Findings Clove was shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in a laboratory study. 160 Clove is not effective for vomiting, upset stomach, nausea, gas, or diarrhea.161 Bioactive Dose Not established. Safety Presumed safe when consumed in normal dietary quantities by nonaller - gic individuals. Ingesting clove oil has been linked to reports of coagulop - athy, liver damage, and other serious side effects in infants and children.55 Coconut ( Cocos nucifera ) Definition Large Arecaceae family nut used in shredded form in baked products. The flesh of coconuts is a source of potassium and saturated fat,162 in addition Copyright Taylor & Francis Group. Do Not Distribute.75 Coconut (Cocos nucifera) C to flavonoids and saponin. Coconut water contains potassium (400 mg, 8% DV per 1 cup). Coconut milk is an emulsion of grated coconut meat14 and is used as a cooking ingredient; when it is prepared as a milk-alternative beverage, coconut milk is fortified with Ca and vitamins A, D, and B12, similar to fortified milk (Table C.1). Coconut products include coconut water, oil, flour, shavings, and coco - nuts and its derivatives are added to snack foods and baby food. 163 Coconut has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of metabolic dis - orders and as an anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and analgesic.164 Scientific Findings The saturated medium-chain triglycerides in coconut oil increase total serum cholesterol but affect HDL cholesterol levels favorably, and are easier to digest and absorb than long-chain triglycerides, and are therefore used during fat malabsorption. 165 Diets rich in coconut oils have been shown to reduce coronary artery disease risk factors, such as tissue plasminogen activator antigen and lipoprotein(a); 155 however, current recommendations are to limit saturated fats, including coconut oil to no more than 7% of calories. 166 Lauric acid, the most abundant fatty acid in coconut oil, is effective in preventing tooth decay and plaque buildup. 155 Saponin and polyphenols in coconut were attributed with anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties in an animal study. 167 Bioactive Dose Not known.

Safety A UL of 10,000 \u00b5g has been established. Corn ( Zea mays ) Definition Poaceae family fruit that is sometimes eaten as a starchy vegetable (e.g., corn on the cob) and other times as a grain (e.g., popcorn).187 Corn is a source of fiber (1.8 g, 5% DV per 1 cob)188 and phytochemicals such as lutein, xeaxanthin, and ferulic acid.204 It is notably deficient in the amino acids lysine and tryptophan, the latter of which is converted into niacin. In the pellagra epidemic of the 1800 s in the Southern US, consumers who ate a corn-based diet with little variety developed pellagra due to defi - ciency of niacin or its precursor tryptophan, both of which were absent in corn. Eaten cooked, canned, frozen, and used to make oil, flour, starch, and other food products, such as high-fructose corn syrup. Traditional medicinal uses of Zea mays include use as a diuretic and for treating dropsy (edema), hypertension, hemorrhage, warts, and diabetes. 179 Scientific Findings Zea mays exhibited antioxidant properties and slowed glucose absorption in a laboratory study.190 Its glycemic index, a measure of how quickly the carbohydrate in a food is digested and absorbed, is \"low\" (52) on a scale where < 5 5 is low and > 7 0 is high.191 Bioactive Dose Not known.

Cranberry is a source of choline, vitamins C, A, and K,194 and proanthocyanidins. Scientific Findings Daily doses of 120-4,000 mL/day of cranberry juice or 400 mg of cranberry extract have been used to help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) 77 based on the results of small studies that postulated cranberry prevents bacteria from sticking to the cells that line the bladder. 195 A review includ - ing 24 studies (n = 4 ,473 subjects) concluded that cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs, and that although some small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recur - rent UTIs, there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. 196 Nonetheless, certain prac - tice guidelines currently recommend consumption of pure cranberry-lingonberry juice as an option for preventing recurrent UTI. 197 Bioactive Dose Not known. Safety Presumed safe when consumed in normal dietary quantities by nonal - lergic individuals. Cucumber ( Cucumis sativus ) Definition Low-calorie gourd vegetable that is high in water similar to watermelon and cantaloupe members of the Cucumis genus. 198 Cucumbers contain vitamin K (8.5 \u00b5 g, 6% DV per \u00bd cup) and are so low in calories (8 calories per \u00bd cup)199 that they are considered to be calorie-free for purposes of weight and diabetes management.
