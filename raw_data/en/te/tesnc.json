NEW Total Health Plan The Franz Center is pleased to offer a new model of care congruent with 21st century medicine. As of January 1, 2023, this new model will take effect. We have two plans: There is a ONE TIME $100 registration fee for each NEW person enrolling in the plan. This is not a yearly fee, and is the same for BOTH PLANS We are happy that we can focus on people and be more solution oriented. Because our services are different from traditional care, we can take time to listen, educate, and empower our families. Total Health Plan 1 for self pay. The monthly membership fee is as follows: $75.00 a month for one member enrolled $150.00 a month for a family of 2-4 (members enrolled) $225.00 a month for a family of 5 or more members enrolled. Lab Tests and Procedures included in your TOTAL HEALTH PLAN 1 plan include: Strep testing, flu testing, RSV testing, Covid antibody testing, and urine analysis NOT included in your monthly fee: a. Vaccines b. Our herbaceutical teas and other products c. Our PCR testing (DNA testing for bacteria, viruses) d. Neurofeedback e. Acupuncture f.

We are accepting Aetna, BCBS, Cigna, Employee Health Network AND UNITED HEALTH CARE The monthly membership fee for the FAMILY is $35.00 It is per family, NOT per child. This helps cover the additional costs for insurance like preauthorization, referrals, and other aspects required by the plans. We still file your insurance. Copay, co-insurance, and deductibles per child will still be collected at the time of service as usual according to your insurance plan. EVERY January begins deductible season for insurance plans, and we will be collecting $100.00 per child per visit on any insurance plan with a deductible until the deductible has been met. Cigna deductible season begins every October. Newborns have a special plan of $320.00 for the first month then begins the concierge plan and billing.

We are excited about our new ability to offer the quality of care we have dreamed about for years. quality of care we have dreamed about for years. - \"Our journey with the Franz center has been one that has been both beautiful and transformative. Dr. Franz has a way of empowering her parents that is exceptional. She educates, listens, and truly cares. When we have seen other providers at the practice, it has been the same wonderful experience. Her providers are smart, caring, and confident leaders that partner with you in the care of your child.

She also started to accept hugs. Dr. Franz carefully monitored my kids and introduced us to homeopathy, cranial sacral therapy, and occupational therapy which all helped throughout our journey. I never thought my child would be able to even cut with scissors, write, or socially interact like others, but now as teens my kids are doing theater, animating, writing at a college level and more! They both now love hugs. I'm not sure where they'd be with the guidance of Dr. Franz. She is truly a one of a "}
