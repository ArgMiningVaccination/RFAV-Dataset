But a year is actually considered relatively \"long term\" when it comes to vaccine safety. This week marks the anniversary of the first delivery of Covid-19 vaccines under [the Covax scheme](https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax) - as well as being more than 14 months since the first dose was given. And scientists explain that's enough time for all but the rarest side effects to have emerged. What's happening in your body? Even though Covid vaccines are relatively new, the processes they trigger in your body are not. Understanding how they stimulate the immune system can help us understand how quickly we can expect to have any negative reactions. After 15 minutes A tiny fraction of people will have an allergic reaction to the inactive ingredients in the vaccine and this will happen within about 15 minutes of receiving it. After a few hours Shortly after receiving the vaccine, the immune system kicks into action. Your body recognises an alien invader and attacks it with immune cells, the weapons it would use against any virus or bacteria. We know that any reactions associated with this phase - known as the innate phase - will happen within hours or a couple of days, including the most common side effects, a sore arm, temperature and other mild flu-like symptoms. A much rarer side effect which has been linked to the mRNA vaccines Pfizer and Moderna - myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart - also occurs in this phase. Though the exact cause of myocarditis is not understood, we do know inflammation is one of the body's responses to infection or injury. Because the reaction is so rare, and younger people being admitted to hospital with the virus is also relatively uncommon, there is still work being done to fully understand the risk in some groups. But cardiologists stress myocarditis is just one factor which needs to be understood alongside the many other risks from the virus, to the immune system, lungs, heart and brain, which the vaccine protects against. Vaccine-induced myocarditis is generally mild and gets better on its own or with basic anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. After 10 days The innate phase kicks off the second bit of your immune response - the adaptive phase, where your body starts to make cells which are specifically tailored to fight off the target virus. This phase kicks in after about 10 days, which is why it takes the same length of time for the vaccine to begin to have any effect in protecting you against Covid. Your body pumps out new immune cells, in a response that peaks after roughly two weeks and fades away after about 28 days. A very rare but serious side effect linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine - [a specific type of blood clot](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-56674796) - happens during this phase and is related to the antibodies produced by your immune system in response to the vaccine. That's why most of these rare clots have been seen within four weeks of vaccination. By 28 days Once the adaptive phase dies down - after about a month - you are left with memory cells which afford you protection for months or years after initial exposure. So your immune system has been changed in the long-term - but you're not having any new responses, Dr Victoria Male, a reproductive immunologist in London explains. So, she says, if you haven't had a reaction after the first couple of months, it is incredibly unlikely you will develop any new reactions to the vaccine. There is never a 100% guarantee with anything in medicine, so we can't say it's impossible that something will happen after that time period. But,\"vaccination history assures us that most side effects occur within hours of receiving the vaccine and rare side effects occur within days to weeks\", explains Prof Jeffrey Mphahlele, a leading South African infectious diseases researcher. Will we identify anything new? So we know, from our understanding of how the immune system works, that an individual who hasn't had a reaction to the vaccine in the first couple of months is vanishingly unlikely to have any new side effects after that. But is it possible that side effects which have already happened are going unnoticed, and may come to light in the coming years? Countries all over the world have put systems in place to monitor side effects and to share that information with each other. The rarer a reaction is, the harder it is to spot. But it is reassuring that these systems were successful in picking up both the blood clots and myocarditis which we've already mentioned, despite being very rare, with only a handful of cases per million doses. While milder symptoms - like a sore arm or temperature - are likely to be significantly under-reported, more severe side effects are thoroughly recorded, Dr Male believes. Because we expect any side effects to emerge relatively quickly, perhaps a more relevant thing to look at - rather than how much time has passed - is how many doses have been given, suggests Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist in Delhi. \"Billions of doses have been given, so any side effect not seen yet would be rarer than one in a billion,\" he said. Nevertheless, medical systems the world over are still looking for side effects, Dr Lahariya said. Indeed, while the vaccines have all completed the expected three phases of trials that usually take place before being offered to the general public, they are still being carefully monitored until at least 2023, to make sure even the rarest of events are picked up. And remember, safety in medicine is all about balancing risks and benefits. All the evidence suggests the overall risks of catching Covid are many times higher than any risks from the vaccine. "}
