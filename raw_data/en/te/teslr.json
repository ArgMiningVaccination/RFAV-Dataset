The report has been prepared in accordance with Part 8 of the Charities Act 2011 and constitutes a directors' report for the purpose of company legislation. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the a ccounting policies set out on pages 15 and 20 of the attached financial statements and comply with the charitable company's memorandum and articles of associati on, applicable laws and the requirements of Statement of Recommended Practice on \"Acc ounting and Reporting by Charities\" (SORP 2005). Public benefit statement Each year our Trustees review our objectives and activities to ensure they continue to reflect our aims. In carrying out this review the Trustees have co nsidered the Charity Commission's general guidance on public benefit. The BSI (the Society) provides benefit to its members, working with students at secondary, undergraduate, masters and PhD level, and practitioners working in Immunology and allied fields ranging from researchers through to clinicians working with patients. The work of the Society's members provides benefit to several million people at home and overseas. This includes individuals being immunised or va ccinated as well as people living with immunity-related conditions, their families, friends and carers. Immunity-related conditions include all forms of cancer, diabet es, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases , as well as conditions associated with organ transplantation. The Society continues to increase its range and output of public engagement work in order to raise awareness of immunological research , infectious disease and treatment. Some activities will be aimed at secondary school children, with whom we wish to foster an interest in biomedical science. Events for non -specialist adults have also been increased. New meetings and events aimed at students and early career immunologists are scheduled as part of our education and careers programme. Structure, Governance and Management Governing document The British Society for Immu nology (BSI) was founded in 1966 and was registered as a charity on 19 December that year. The BSI was formally incorporated on 4 Ja nuary 1995 as a private company, limited by guarantee. It has no issued shar e capital and the liability of its members is limited to a sum not exceeding \u00a31. The Society's governing document is the Memorandum and Articles of Association. Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 3 Structure, Governance and Management (continued) Trustees Members of the Board of Trustees are company directors for the purposes of the Companies Act and charity Trustees for the purposes of the Charities Act 2011. The Trustees serving during th e year and since the year end were as follows:- Trustees Appointed / Resigned Professor Arne Akbar Professor R N Barker Dr William Egner Professor David Gray Dr Marieke Hoeve Appointed 6 December 2011 Professor Paul Lehner Resigned July 2012 Dr D Morgan Dr L Nicholson Dr Diane Williamson Appointed 21 July 2011 Recruitment and appointment of Trustees The business of the BSI is conducted by the Board of Trustees. In any matters concerning interpretation of the rules, the decision shal l rest with the Trustees, who will also decide any matters concerning the Society which are not covered by the rules. The full rules for the appointment of Trustees, and their obligation s, are contained within the Memorandum & Articles of Association. The Trustees of the Society are elected by the membership and number no fewer than 5 and no more than 12. All Trustees have to have been a member of the Society for at least 12 months. They will include the General Secretary and Treasurer and a number of members who will take special areas of responsibility as the organisation requires. For example, these may include a Programme Secretary, Education Se cretary, International Secretary, Clinical Secretary, Group Secretary and Chair of Forum. One or more additional Trustees may be co-opted at the Trustees' discretion for up to 12 months, after which time their continuing membership of the board will be formalised by election at the AGM. As part of their induction process, Trustees spend some time at head office, with the Chief Executive and staff. They are provided with a Trustee resource pack and are taken through a number of key areas outlining the history of the Society, background information, job description, areas of responsibility and usef ul information from the Charity Commission. Trustees are briefed on key areas of governance, strategy and activity. All trustees completed and returned statements of interest and conflict of interest documentation. No issues arose from these. Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 4 Structure, Governance and Management (continued) Organisational structure As stated, the business of the Society is conducted by the Board of Trustees, which has legal responsibility for the organisation. The Board meets quarterly. The day to day management of the Society is delegated to the Chief Executive (CEO - who is also the Company Secretary) and, through her, the members of the senior management team. This comprises the CEO, Head of Marketing & Communications and the Finance Manager, supported by the Office Co-Ordinator, who is also PA to the CEO. The team works to the BSI's agreed strategic plan, the current ve rsion of which runs from 2012 to 2016 and has recently been reviewed. The updated plan will better reflect the current priorities of the Society and, without moving away from its core aims and objectives, will ensure that its current activities have maxi mum relevance and impact. Committees In addition to the Board of Trustees, the BSI has a representative body of approximately 16 - 20 members called the Forum. This committee is deliberative and focuses on policy. This body has no legal or management responsibility and meets biannually. The content of the Society's scientific progra mme, particularly that of congress, is the responsibility of the Programme Committee. Th is is a committee of up to 20 members who meet three times a year. The Clinical Immunology and Allergy Section (C IAS) of the Society has its own Executive Committee which also meets tria nnually and represents a range of clinicians, trainees and nurses. The BSI membership is formed into either re gional groups or affinity groups that have a specific specialist interest su ch as vaccination or mathematical modelling, to name but two. These groups run their own programmes of me etings and are supported by the Society, financially and administratively. The representa tives of these groups meet formally, face to face, once a year. The BSI's journals, Immunology and Clinical and Experimental Immunology are published in partnership with Wiley-Blackwell. The Journa ls Committee meets bia nnually and comprises the BSI General Secretary and Treasurer, th e Editors-in-Chief, BSI staff members and colleagues from Wiley-Blackwell. Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 5 Structure, Governance and Management (continued) Staff The CEO has responsibility for the Society' s income and expenditure and authorises expenditure within the agreed budget. She is al so responsible for the implementation of the strategic plan and its deliverables, for th e good governance an d management of the organisation (advising the Board as appropriate) and reporting to exte rnal bodies such as Companies House and the Charity Commission. She represents the BSI at a number of meetings and events and as a member of ex ternal committees such as the RCP Learned Societies Group, the Society of Biology, the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee and the Foundation for Science and Technology to name a few. The Finance Manager is responsible for the effective and efficien t management of the Society's finances and the reporting thereo f including working with the BSI auditors, producing management accounts and budget information, cash-flow reports and VAT returns. He has overall responsibility for fina nce and financial systems, IT, and aspects of membership management. The Head of Marketing & Communications ma nages the key BSI activities: journals; congress, other meetings and events; public engagement and education; membership communications and database management; publ ications and resources; website. The CEO currently works with members of the team and with some committee members in areas of policy. The Office Co-Ordinator supports the CEO in many aspects of her work including governance matters, and is the Executive Se cretary for the BSI committees. She is also responsible for HR, staff welfare and estate mana gement of the BSI's property in South West London. Most members of the small BSI team work flexibly and are involved in various activities and projects as need and resource demand. Risk Management The Trustees are satisfied that there are in place adequate control systems to provide reasonable assurance against misstatement or lo ss. These include a strategic business plan reviewed by the Trustees annually, reviews of performance against targets, delegation of authority to spend within defined limits, and segregation of duties where appropriate. Other external risks to which the Society may be ex posed are identified and discussed at regular Trustees' meetings and any a ppropriate action implemented. The Treasurer, with input from an external co nsultant and the CEO recently undertook a risk assessment for the society. Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 6 Structure, Governance and Management (continued) Risk Management (continued) BSI Risk Assessment 2012 Risks were assessed independently by 10 individu als (4 staff and 6 trustees) for likelihood and impact and a final matrix score was calculated fr om the averages, weighted as suggested in the consultation document prepared by Sue Thor n Consulting. Risks were then ranked by matrix score and classified by type. Based on this assessment the following recommendations are proposed for discussion by the trustees: Key staff activities are identified and any areas where a single person is critical for a function are defined and the risk mitigated by tr aining a second staff member in that area. Provide training in data protection and ICT se curity. Ensure we have an adequate backup policy. Define the limits of our liability and consider if insurance is necessary. Identify any proprietary computer code and consider insurance. Develop a policy that allows a transition from current publishing mo del to future models as envisaged by the Finch report on Expand ing Access to Publishe d Research Findings. This will entail changes in how the society is financed that wi ll develop over several years. Develop a reserve policy to provide a buffer against this change. Make necessary changes to the Memorandum of Association. General discussion of any appropriate remedial me asures for matrix scores of less than 7. Objectives and activities The BSI's main objective continues to be to promote and support excellence in research, scholarship and clinical practice in Immunology for the benefit of human and animal health and welfare. The BSI seeks to help British Immunology accomplish the highest possible goals. The BSI's priorities for the financial year 2011 - 2012 were: Delivering an excellent scientific programm e through congress, meetings and events The BSI runs a highly regarded congress for tw o out of every three years. The Society does not hold a congress during the year in which the European Congress of Immunology runs, which is every three years. In addition, pr ogrammes of seminars and one and two day meetings take place throughout the UK, along with summer schools and career sessions. The BSI aims to provide opportunities to discuss rese arch and good practice, to share ideas and to meet fellow immunologists. The Society prov ides meetings and even ts for immunologists throughout each stage of their careers. Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 7 Objectives and activities (continued) Producing high quality journals, Immunology and Clinical & Experimental Immunology The publication of our journals is imperative to our dissemination of research. The Society constantly strives to attract top authors and to commission innovative and useful content. The editorial teams are of a very high calibr e and are supported by eminent editorial board members from around the world. The relationshi ps between the BSI staff team, the editors, authors and publisher continues to thrive. Membership support and development The BSI provides high quality member communications through Immunology News , its quarterly members' magazine, and eNews bulle tins. It provides forums for members to engage with the Society, to be involved in committees and to run activities of particular interest to them. The BSI provides grants and bursaries to its members to attend meetings and courses. Membership current ly stands at over 4,000, the highest during the Society's history. Education and public engagement activities The BSI is committed to running innovative pr ojects for non-specialist audiences including adults of all ages and young people. The Soci ety puts on events at the Cheltenham Science Festival, the British Science Association's Fe stival of Science and the Edinburgh Science Festival. The BSI actively supports the Global Day of Immunology and undertakes numerous activities in schools and at science fairs and ev ents for children and families. The Society is involved in curriculum develo pment and the provision of careers advice along with educational resources. Web and resource development The Society has made it a priority to continue the development of its content-rich website, providing bespoke resources for specialist and non-specialist audiences. The BSI has a Facebook presence and its website constantly provides news for its growing user base. Media, PR and public affairs work The BSI works with the Science Media Centre and its members to provide input to the media. It uses the platform of its events to raise awareness of immu nology issues with the media, often at a local level. Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 8 Objectives and activities (continued) Supporting other societies The BSI supports the work of the Internatio nal Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) and the European Federation of Immunological So cieties (EFIS). It is an active member of the Society of Biology, the Animal Science Group, Understanding Animal Research, the Royal College of Physicians, Federation of Clinical Immunological Societies (FOCIS) and the World Allergy Organisation . It also supports Transplant 2013 and Rare Disease UK. The BSI runs sessions at international meetings an d runs meetings in pa rtnership with other groups. The BSI would like to acknowledge the enormous contribution of its membership, many of whom volunteer time to attend and organise meetings, visit schools, speak on behalf of the Society and undertake many activities to ensure the success of the organisation. Alongside the 80 current committee members, there are many other members who contri bute time and ideas on a regular basis. We are grateful for their commitment and energy. Achievements and performance Delivering an excellent scientific programm e through congress, meetings and events The 2011 Congress held in Liverpool was widely heralded a great succe ss. Delegate numbers increased on the previous year, with over 1,200 attendees. The scientific programme, including special sessions fo r undergraduates, PhD students and PostDocs, was immensely strong and feedback from those attending wa s very positive. The BSI Board, Programme Committee and staff have reviewed the conf erence thoroughly and taken on board all comments and suggestions receiv ed in order to make furt her improvements to the 2013 meeting. We also held meetings with the exhi bitors and sponsors to ensure we provide a successful forum for them next year and bey ond. It was generally agreed that Liverpool provided an excellent conference space with clos e-by venues for social functions, dinners and informal meetings. The provision of free refreshments and a hot lunchtime meal was welcomed along with the evening social 'bas h' and the speakers' dinner. The BSI makes a substantial loss on congress by heavily subsidising the registration fees, especially those paid by members and students. The UK-PIN (Primary Immunodefi ciency Network) ran its biennial meeting straight after the congress, enabling synergy between the clin ical immunologists attending some or all of both meetings. It is planned to contin ue this arrangement in the future. The BSI supported and supported main meetin gs in: London, Manchester, Cambridge, Newcastle, East Anglia, Wessex and Bristol, alongside smaller meeting and seminar series throughout the UK and sponsored the Germinal Centres Conference with the West Midlands group. Affinity Group meetings took place between the Vaccine Affinity Group and the Allergy section of the Royal Society of Medicine in addition to meetings run by the Mathematical Modelling Group and the Infect ion and Immunity Group. We also welcomed the Stromal Immunology Group to the society - the BSI's newest affinity group. They held their inaugural meeting in March this year. Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 9 Achievements and performance (continued) Delivering an excellent scientific programm e through congress, meetings and events (continued) The BSI ran a session at the American Associ ation of Immunologist s annual meeting in Boston and sponsored the Gordon Brown Research Conference in Italy. Another two highlights of the year were the summer sch ool held in Cardiff in July 2011 and the Young Immunologists Forum held in Grea t Missenden in April this year. As a result of their success, the BSI is committed to developing further its programmes for studen ts and early career immunologists and to complement these with meetings and events aimed at all sections of the membership. In keeping with this, the BSI also supported the 9th John Humphrey Advanced Immunology Course that took plac e in Cuba in March. We launched a new Immunodeficiency Network this year, focusing specially on increasing patient involvement through key representative bodies. The BSI Patient Forum has met twice and will continue to meet and communicate regularl y and to work with the Clinical section of the society. Producing high quality journals; Immunology and Clinical & Experimental Immunology The journals continue to provide the society with its main source of revenue. The impact factors of both journals increased. Immuno logy is now at IF 3.321 and Clinical and Experimental Immunology has reache d its all time high at 3.36. We are highly aware of the changes taking pl ace in the disseminatio n and publication of research. There has been a progressive increase in the number of open access publications, with new business models being pr oposed and pressure from fund ing bodies to make research available as quickly and freely as possible. Th e BSI, through the CEO, has been involved in meetings with other learned societies, has at tended Parliamentary an d Scientific Committee meeting s where publishing has been discussed and has written briefing papers and attended meetings at the European Commission. Followi ng the publication of the Finch Report, we shall be looking at our own business model an d the implications goin g forward of a reduced revenue scenario for the society.

Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 11 Achievements and performance (continued) Membership support and development BSI membership has increased again this year. We have over 4,000 members. Immunology News c o n t i n u e s t o b e v e r y w e l l r e ceived. It is evident that th ere is a continuing sense of engagement and enthusiasm from within the me mbership, with a willingness to volunteer to organise sessions and special meetings, join wo rking groups and an increase in the number of people putting themselves forward to join co mmittees and stand for election. We are very grateful for this continued and growing contribution from our members. The BSI continues to develop and grow the activity and impact of its clinical members through the work of the CIAS. The CIAS had input into Department of Health, House of Lords, Royal College of Pathologists and Royal College of Physicians activities as well as processing several applications for excellence awards. This was the fourth year that the BSI had been involved in nominating consultants for the Clinical Excellence Awards, administered by the Advisory Committee on Clinical Excellence Awards (ACCEA). The BSI became a member of FOCIS during the year. We provided grants and awards to individu als which totalled \u00a3115,000 , and have increased from \u00a364,000 in the previous year. Education and public engagement activities The BSI continued to increase its public en gagement and outreach programmes during the year. 'The Secret Life of Snot' has been touring and has been featured on Radio York as part of the Science out of the lab event. The Manchester Immunology Group ran The Body Experience at the Manchester Museum as pa rt of National Science & Engineering Week (NSEW) and the BSI attended the Big Bang Fair 2012 and worked with the Society for Applied Microbiology on Disease Detectives and with the Moredun Research Institute on Bug Busters in Edinburgh. Following on from last year's knitting project at the Cheltenham Science Festival, the BSI and the MS Society fi nanced and worked on the production of the Charcot Tapestry - a series of huge fabric and tapest ry panels depicting what happens in the brain of an MS sufferer. The finished pane ls were launched at MS Life, the big MS convention for people with MS, their carers and those interested in the disease. Our BSI's Arts/ Science Project, Going Viral was in development, with a music workshop being run during April. The full project will be laun ched in the financial year 2012-13. The new Careers in Immunology Booklet has been launched. Web and resource development During the year, members of BSI staff were able to generate detailed and tailored reports of web usage. With this information, they will be able to monitor use and growth areas effectively. The site continued to be updated, with resour ces added for general and specialist audiences. Regular blogs were available and the BSI's presence on Facebook has grown (over 1,220 'likes'). News feeds are available on the site, with top news stories and regular highlights presented on the home page. Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 12 Achievements and performance (continued) Web and resource development (continued) Other resources were developed as part of public engagement activities (see above) and in support of work in schools. This is an on going part of the Society's work. The BSI continues to develop its Bite-S ized Immunology Series and has plans to relaunch this across new and existing platforms next year. Media, PR and public affairs work The Society invested in specia list PR consultancy in order to see whether media interest could be generated from congress. Key speakers a n d t o p i c s t h a t w e r e c o n s i d e r e d t o b e potentially of interest were singled out and presented to the media through press releases and the offer of interviews or furt her information. Key publications were invited to attend the conference and were provided with work spac e. Unfortunately, we only had attendance from Nature publications and were not successful in generating any media coverage. The problems were generally that speakers were no t prepared to discuss or release new findings prior to the formal publ ication of data and information. Fo r others, the media had picked up on new research as it was published, rather than at the point of dissemination at congress. We shall be looking further into how we might improve on this fo r 2013 and get more specific 'buy-in' from the speakers. We ran a very successful media training work shop for a group of immunologists. We hope that by improving the media skills of groups of our members we shall be able to increase the presence of immunology in the media in the future supportin g other societies. Supporting other societies The BSI provided support to other societies by paying subscriptions and promoting their work and events where appropriate (eg for the IUIS and EFIS). As reported previously, the Society put on a session at the AAI meeting and supported meetings of other organizations. Financial review Results for the year The statement of financial activities is shown on page 18 of the annual report and accounts. The results for the year show a decrease in incoming resources and an increase in expenditure, producing an overa ll decrease in funds of \u00a387,672, compared to an increase in funds of \u00a3164,914 for the previous financial year. The decrease in incoming resources was due to a drop in the inco me generated by the society's journals, decreasing to \u00a31,061,949 (2 011 - \u00a31,314,398). This decrease was due to an overpayment of journal income duri ng 2010-11 which was re paid during 2011-12. Resources expended increased because of the expenditure relating to other scientific meetings of \u00a3309,138 (2011 - \u00a3145,243). The overall net movement in funds is also st ated after a reduction in the value of the Society's investment property of \u00a3250,000 (2011 - \u00a3403,000). Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 13 Financial review (continued) Investment powers, policy and performance In general terms, worldwide in vestment markets returned modest gains during the year, and the Society's financial statements report an increase in the market value of its quoted investments. Working with its current invest ment managers, the Society continues to review and develop its investment strategy to ensure it remains a ppropriate and consistent with overall strategic and financial management aims. Reserves policy The Society's reserves policy is derived from a risk assessment of each category of income and expenditure which determines the level of reserves required to cover costs and any commitments during periods of unforeseen difficu lty. The Society believes that it is prudent to maintain net current assets, plus the value of its investment po rtfolio, at a level equivalent to a minimum of twelve months average expend iture together with sufficient resources to fund future commitments relating to Congress. This target is reviewed annually as part of the overall approach to managing risk. Financial position At 30 June 2012 the Society had free reserv es of \u00a32,786,791 which is well above the targeted level. However, these reserves, whic h mainly consist of investments held for the medium to long term, give the Society certai nty in a difficult economic climate and will allow the Society to fund worthy pr ojects identified by the Trustees. Plans for future periods As already mentioned in the report, we are keenly aware of the changing publishing landscape and the threat this poses to our current business model and revenue levels. We have started the process of undertaking a full review of the opportunities this changing landscape might offer, alongside the clear th reats. We shall be promoting our own Open Access publishing models and wi ll be working with our publishing partner, Wiley-Blackwell, to publish papers through their own Open Access Immunology journal. We are also planning to publish immunology e-books via a new arrangement with Springer. The Society plans to further increase its rang e and output of public engagement work in order to raise awareness of immunological research, infectious disease and treatment. The arts and science project Going Vira l launches formally in 2012 an d we shall build a number of education and outreach activities around this work. Further meetings and events aimed at students and early career immunologists are scheduled as part of our education and careers programme. We are also planning additional events, such as a 'masterclass' series, that will be of use to a wide range of members. Our aim is to ensure that, going forward, the BSI has special meetings, courses and re sources aimed at each sector of the BSI membership, from early career traine es and students though to those at a senior level within their field, meeting each group's specific needs and interests. Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 14 Plans for future periods (continued) We shall be relaunching the Bite-Sized I mmunology series, exploiting new technology platforms, including apps, to disseminate this as widely as possible and to ensure we can update information quickly and easily. Furthe r content will be produced ready for this launch. Statement of trustees' responsibilities The trustees (who are also directors of British Society for Immunology for the purposes of company law) are responsible for preparing the trustees' report and fi nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and Unit ed Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). Company law requires the trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the charity and of the incoming resources and application of resources, includin g the income and expenditure, of the charity for that period. Under company law the trust ees must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the charitable company and of the incoming resource s and application of resources, including the income and expenditure, of the charitable company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the trustees are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; observe the methods and principles in the Statement of Recommended Practice (Accounting and Reporting by Char ities) (the Charities' SORP); make judgements and estimates th at are reasonable and prudent; state whether applicable United Kingdom A ccounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charity will continue in operation. The trustees are responsible for keeping adequa te accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the charity and enable them to ensure that the financial stat ements comply with the Comp anies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charity and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Each of the trustees confirms that: so far as the trustee is aware, there is no re levant audit information of which the charity's auditors are unaware; and the trustee has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a trustee in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the charity's auditors are aware of that information. Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 15 Statement of trustees' responsibilities (continued) This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accord ance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006. The trustees are responsible for the maintena nce and integrity of corporate and financial information included on the charity's website. Legislation in the Un ited Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial st atements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Approved by the trustees and signed on their behalf by: David Gray Trustee Approved by the trustees on: 24 January 2013 Independent auditor's report 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 16 Independent auditor's report to the members of the British Society for Immunology We have audited the financial statements of the British Society for Immunology for the year ended 30 June 2012 which comprise the statement of financial ac tivities, the balance sheet, the principal accounting policies and the rela ted notes. The financia l reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). This report is made solely to the charity's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our au dit work has been und ertaken so that we might state to the charity's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone othe r than the charity and the charity's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report , or for the opinions we have formed. Respective responsibilities of trustees and auditor The trustees are also the directors of the ch aritable company for the purposes of company law. As explained more fully in the Statement of trustees' responsibilities as set out in the trustees' report, the trustees are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and Internatio nal Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with th e Auditing Practices Bo ard's (APB's) Ethical Standards for Auditors. Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assura nce that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the charitable company's circumstances and have been consistently appl ied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the trustees; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the trustees' report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. Independent auditor's report 30 June 2012 British Society for Immunology 17 Opinion on financial statements In our opinion the financial statements: give a true and fair view of the state of the charitable company's affairs as at 30 June 2012 and of its incoming resources and applicatio n of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then ended; have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and have been prepared in acco rdance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion the information given in the trus tees' report for the fi nancial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: adequate accounting records have not been kept or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting reco rds and returns; or certain disclosures of trustees' remunera tion specified by law are not made; or we have not received all the information an d explanations we require for our audit. the trustees were not entitled to prepare the financial statem ents in accordance with the small companies regime.
