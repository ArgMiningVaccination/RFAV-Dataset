Internet seems to have exploded with the talk of all things physical. I however intend to introduce you all to a different dimension of Human Life, the spiritual dimension. Spiritual Dimension can be built into the Human Life only through Spiritual Habits. I have a spiritual habit of contemplating on nature's ways. There is so much to learn from nature if we quieten our minds and listen to what nature has to teach us. The spiritual lessons from nature tend to be most profound. These lessons apply to and are relevant to Human Life. These lessons make us humble realizing the power of nature and God. I thought I would share the lessons from nature that I have discovered through my contemplation of nature. Every morning when I wake up at dawn I greet the day with the utmost joy. But my greeting is nowhere near the glorious greeting that the sun gives the mountains. One can learn from the Sun how to greet the other person. The greeting should be full of joy, full of positive energy, radiant and glowing. Even the simple \"hello\" can be like the Sun's greeting to the mountains. Since we are talking about the Sun I thought I would reflect upon how nature teaches us about how to work on a cause, how nature teaches us about humility. The sun with all those planets revolving around it and dependent on it, can still ripen a bunch of grapes as if it had nothing else in the universe to do. The sun is so important, so great but it does not ignore a bunch of grapes in a little unknown village thinking it is not important. The sun although so important and great is so humble and \"cause and effect\" oriented. Contemplate on how a setting sun still whispers a promise for tomorrow...The sun teaches us a lesson in hope...teaches us how to be hopeful. When you are having a bad day do you sit there feeling sorry for yourself? The answer is no.. You look forward to tomorrow. No two days are the same. Each day brings its own miracle. The rising sun has a lesson to teach us as well. Each new day gives us another chance to get it right. Each day the rising sun tells us not to repeat the mistakes of yesterday. Reflect on how nature paces itself. Real progress can only happen by following nature's laws, for example the law of harvest. Nature does not hurry and yet everything in nature is accomplished. There is never a hurry in having the four seasons over and done with. When you plant a seed it does not grow in a tree overnight, High tide and low tide happens when it is supposed to . Everything in nature happens at a set pace and yet important outcomes such as harvest to feed the planet, water to sustain life, countries emerging out of natural disasters at the least are accomplished. The Law of Harvest which is you reap what you sow and you reap more than you sow also teaches us that Nature cannot be tricked or cheated. She will give up to you the object of your struggles only after you have paid her price. We all have different ways of welcoming nature into our homes. Some people put indoor plants in their homes, some people have indoor pets. I open my windows, letting the cool breeze in on a summer's day and also welcoming the fragrance of the flowers in the garden. These are polite expressions of nature. Notice how through these expressions nature does not knock to come into your home and yet you are not left intimidated..you don't feel as if nature is intruding. One can learn from these polite and pleasant expressions of nature that are welcomed by us with open arms. When I go for a walk I always look to see where I can find flowers. Not the pretty ones in luscious well maintained gardens but the ones that bloom in adversity...the ones that overcome trials and still bloom because the flower that blooms in adversity grows beautiful from its trials. These flowers remind me that the people who overcome adversities bloom and become more beautiful on the inside through each trial that they overcome. There is a special glow...an aura surrounding these beautiful people. When anybody complains to me about loneliness I feel compelled to ask them..is there a living, breathing indoor plant or a pet in your house? If the answer is yes I ask them then why are you lonely? If the answer is no I ask them to step out, seek nature..seek the companionship of living things in nature... because as long as you are surrounded by nature ..you can never be lonely. Remember always that nature is the closest companion that you have..Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.... Contemplate on how each and every thing in nature radiates and dwells in its own uniqueness..its own individuality. A rose does not try to be anything else. An apple is always an apple, an apple tree always produces apples . Nature becomes beautiful because of the uniqueness of all the beings that nature comprises of. Nature teaches us that true beauty comes from being comfortable with yourself. What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well...When I was growing up my mother told me to look for the good in every situation. There is good in every situation even a bad one. You just have to look for it. The desert hiding a well also teaches us about providence. When you are aligned with God's purpose and God's vision for your life providence is established no matter what...similar to the well hidden in the dessert. Nature and Worship are closely integrated. Worship essentially means devotion. Nature can only survive with help from gods. For example If it does not rain, nature is destroyed. If it rains too much then nature is destroyed too. When it rains.., how much it rains..none of this in nature's hands. Yet all of nature, human beings, animals, plants follow nature's laws. Nature does everything in its power and leaves rest to the Gods. Nature survives through faith and devotion to the Gods. We need to learn from nature how to \"Let go and Let God....\" Ralph Waldo Emerson stated that \"The happiest man is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship...\" I believe It is the most important spiritual lesson we can learn from Nature !
