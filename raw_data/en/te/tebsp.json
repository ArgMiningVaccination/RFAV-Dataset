If mind does not combine with atma, indriyas and subject, then one doesnot get knowledge. Thus, presence and absence of knowledge is characteristics of the mind9. There are two properties of the mind- anutva and ekat- va10.Chintan,vichar,uhya,dhyeya,sankalp etc. are subjects of the mind11.To operate all the indriyas to be involved in them, to stop itself from bad subjects, uhya and vichar are func- tions of picted yoga Atma with mind and four mahabhutas (except akash ) goes from old body to new body and this movement of atma from one body to another body can be seen only by divya- drishti (divine eye)14.Atma enters into fetus with mind. AcharyaCharak has explained that whatever present in microcosm or man that is also present in macrocosm or universe15.He has further mentioned that person who sees the lokwithin himself and himself within the lok,getssatyabuddhi .He understands that all the lokas are within himself and he is the only root cause of all the wordlyprob- lems.He becomes free from worldly desires then gets salvation16.AcharyaCharak has de- scribed that one who does not enter into an- taratma of the patient with the lamp of knowledge and wisdom, he cannot treat the diseases17. Acharrasayan is a special contri- bution of AcharyaCharak in the field of Ayurveda .He has described many spiritual works in acharrasayan18in which some are as follows- Dharmashastraparam- to follow Vedic texts because they provide conscious and enligh- tened life. Adhyatmapravanendriyam- to be involved in spiritual activities.Tapasvinam- to be focused on the task. Dan nityam- to do charity regularly. Devarchneratam- devoted to serve deva, bramhan, acharya, etc. In Ayurvedic text books,many diseases like kustha are said to be happened due to vari- ous sins.Daivavyapasrayachikitsa (divine therapy) has been described in the manage- ment of many diseases like jwar19.AcharyaSushrut has explained that if the patient of kustha dies,he gets kustha again in the next lingasharir having causative factors of kus- thaenters from previous body to the next body and these factors cause kustha in the next body also. This is a proof of description ofreincarnation in ayurvedic texts. Some spiritual aspects have not been explained directly in ayurvedic texts but these have been explained in other Vedic texts. These spiritual aspects have been in- cluded by Central Council of Indian Medi- cine in the syllabus of BAMS to know its importance and utility in Ayurveda. These spiritual aspects are as follows- Astangyoga21- Like astang Ayurveda , astang yoga has been explained by Patanjali satisfaction Swadhyaya - study of Vedic literatures which leads to self realizationPal Guru Sharan: Spiritual Dimensions Of Ayurveda 940www.iamj.in IAMJ: Volume 3 ; Issue 3; March -2015Tapa - austerity and observances for body and mind Ishwarpranidhan- surrender to God 3.

There are two nadis on either side of the spinal column called Ida and Pingla and a hallow canal called Sushumna lies between them. Kundalini Shakti sleeps at lower end of Sushumna in a trance sleep( yoga ni- dra).Ida starts from the right testicle and Pingla from the left and they both meet the Sushumna at the muladharchakra .Idaflows Pal Guru Sharan: Spiritual Dimensions Of Ayurveda 942www.iamj.in IAMJ: Volume 3 ; Issue 3; March -2015through the left nostril and Pingla through the Idais cooling while Pingla is heat- ing. Idaand Pingla indicate time while Su- shumna is the devourer of time. Yogi defies death by devitalizing Idaand Pingla and taking the prana through Sushumna to the crown of the head or Bramha-randhra. When the kundalini enters the Sushumnana- di,the prana also enters the Sushumna along with kundalini and its progress is characte- rized by supernatural visions, acquisition of special powers, knowledge, peace and bliss. Regular practice of UddiyanBandha is a powerful yogic kriya awaken of yogasans, and Bandhas is required regularly to awaken kundalini. There are different opinions about the positions of chakras in the body. Doctors dissect the physical body but they are not able to find the centers, lotuses and so forth. Some says that chakras are situated only in the astral body and others say that chakras are developed during the course of medita- tion and they are not in the astral body. Re- ality is that the chakras are in a dormant state in the pranmayakosha of the astral body which can be opened by deep medita- tion. Panch-kosha24- There are five material sheaths that envelope the soul like concentric rings. Each sheath is more subtle than preceding one and each succeeding sheath controls the activity of preceding sheath. These sheath are as fol- lows- 1.AnnamayaKosh or Food Sheath 2.PranamayaKosh or Vital- Air Sheath 3.ManomayaKosh or Mental Sheath 4.VigyanamayaKosh or Intellectual Sheath 5.AnandmayaKosh or Bliss Sheath1.AnnamayaKosh or Food Sheath- The physical body is known as food sheath. The physical body arises out of food, exists in food, after death goes back to become food for other organisms. This organ con- sists of five organs of perception and five organs of action. Personality of the individ- ual depends on the condition of this kosha , the formation of which continues life after life. The physique in the next birth is de- cided by the state of annamayakosh of earli- er births. Living through this layer, man identifies himself as a mass of skin, flesh, fat, bones and filth. Purification and devel- opment of this kosh is possible through upawasa , tatva-suddhi and tapash- charya. All medicines prescribed allopa- thy act on this kosh. 2.PranamayaKosh or Vital- Air Sheath This contains all the pranvayus in the sys- tems, energy channels( nadis) and energy centers( chakras) . This sheath represents in- ternal physiological functions of the body. It contains 5 faculties- Prana - perception Apana - excretion Samana - digestion Vyana - circulation Udana - thinking This sheath controls and regulates the food sheath. Pranayam, acupuncture, reiki and magnetotherapy seem to be working on this kosha. Homeopathy medicines in moderate potencies act on this kosha. 3.ManomayaKosh or Mental Sheath This is psycho-emotional sheath. This sheath decides whether a person is emotion- al or unemotional, sensitive or nonsensitive and easily or uneasily movable. Mind along with five sensory organs is said to constitute this sheath. This sheath controls both the Pal Guru Sharan: Spiritual Dimensions Of Ayurveda 943www.iamj.in IAMJ: Volume 3 ; Issue 3; March -2015previous sheaths. Aromatherapy, music therapy, colour therapy and homeopathic medicines in higher potencies act on this kosha. 4. VigyanamayaKosh or Intellectual Sheath This sheath is full of intelligence.This is the level of cognition,conditioning or de- conditioning of one's core beliefs.This is the seat of ego. This sheath is composed of in- tellection associated with the organs of per- ception. Meditation and psychotherapy works on this sheath.5.AnandmayaKosh or Bliss Sheath This is the innermost of all the sheaths and controls the intellectual sheath. It consists of desires before they become manifest into thoughts and actions. This sheath has its ful- lest play during deep sleep. Apart from these five sheaths, there are two sheaths also- chittakosh and sat kosh. Development of all seven sheaths is necessary for complete spiritual evolution. Table-2 Body Kosh Stage Parts of the body Type Realm God rea- lizedDivine man Aura25- Aura is an energy field emanating from the surface of a person or object. This emana- tion is visualized as an outline of cascading colour and may represent soul vibrations. Modern metaphysics identify the aura as electromagnetic fields. The existence of electromagnetic fields around every object is a scientifically proved fact. Scientists say that aura may be seen by naked eyes but this ability weakens with age. Focused training may improve the ability to see auras. Auras vibrate to different colors, sounds and light frequencies. The color spectrum varies with one's physical, emotional , men- tal and spiritual states. Auras of our body can be recorded by Kirlian photography. To know conditions of aura, we can detect dis- eases occurring in future and can be ma- naged before manifestations. AcharyaCha- rak has explained seven types of prabha. This prabha can be correlated with aura. Seven Bodies26- We have seven bodies- physical, etheric, astral , mental, spiritual, cosmic and nirvanic body.

He has fur- ther described that defect in sperm and/or ovum leads to defect in the fetus. He has mentioned the cause of birth of male, female and intersex baby and also the cause of twins. They knew about internal anatomy and physiology of our body without ad- vanced diagnostic tools like USG, CT- SCAN, MRI, etc. It is possible to see these microstructures and microfunctions without any microscope in the state of fourth body. AcharyaSushrut has explained that the parts of body that can be seen through naked eyes are less, those that cannot be seen are infi- nite. The knowledge of those unseen parts like Atmacan only be had by the eyes of me- ditation and eyes of knowledge27. Our Acharyas has described rasa, guna, veerya, vipak and prabhav of millions of plants. It isnot possible to know medicinal properties of so many plants by clinical tri- als.It is possible when plants tell their prop- erties themselves. It is said about Lukman that he asked plants about their medicinal properties and plants replied. A person of fourth body can talk to plants. These are spi- ritual dimensions of Ayurveda which will be understood by science in future. CONCLUSION Modern medicine considers human body as a complex biotic machine. It treats the dis- ease not the patient. Some people feel that something is lacking in the management of modern medical science even afterhaving ultra-advanced technology in medicine and surgery. Modern medicine treats the disease but does not care the patient causing iatro- genic disorders. Many parts of body can be replaced by modern surgery i.e. kidney transplant, liver transplant, heart transplant, etc. Now, scientists consider that human is more than this physical body and therefore, only physical wellbeing is not sufficient. Ayurveda emphasizes on prevention of dis- eases rather than treatment. AcharyaCharak has described first to maintain the health of a healthy person then, management of the dis- eases of the diseased person. He has de- scribed various methods for prevention of diseases such as dincharya,ratricharya, ritu- charya, swasthvritta, acharrasayan etc. To spend some amount on prevention we can save very much amount which is spent on treatment. In treatment also, we can save very much amount to follow Ayurvedic methods of diagnosis and management. Thus, we can prevent physical, mental and Pal Guru Sharan: Spiritual Dimensions Of Ayurveda 945www.iamj.in IAMJ: Volume 3 ; Issue 3; March -2015social problems to adopt these preventive media. Thus, to do spiritual growth and to adopt Ayurvedic methods of diagnosis we can reduce dependency on instruments and laboratories leading economic management of diseases. By spiritual growth, we can re- duce corruption, terrorism, criminalism and violence in the society causing social well- being which has been mentioned in the defi- nition of health by WHO. Thus, apart from physical well-being, we can achieve mental, emotional, social and spiritual well-being to follow these spiritual dimensions of Ayur- veda. It is required to popularize these as- pects of Ayurveda in the society to make this planet healthy, happy and peaceful. REFERENCES 1.
