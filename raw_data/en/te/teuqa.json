Aromatherapy, also referred to as Essential Oil therapy, is the art and science of utilizing naturally extracted aromatic essences from plants to balance, harmonize, and promote the health of body, mind, and spirit. It unifies physiological, psychological, and spiritual processes to enhance an individual's innate healing process. As the practice of aromatherapy has progressed, it has adopted a more holistic approach encompassing the whole body, mind and spirit (energy). How Does it Work? When applied to the skin, essential oils penetrate via the hair follicles and sweat glands, and are absorbed into the body fluids, where they not only help to kill bacteria and viruses but also stimulate the body's immune system. Some essential oils can increase the circulation and help with the elimination of toxins, others can promote new cell growth and encourage the body's natural ability to heal itself by regulating the immune system. Each essential oil has its own character and aroma, exhibiting a varying number of properties and benefits which are unique to itself. When one inhales essential oils the minute molecules are readily absorbed into the bloodstream via the lungs, which then oxygenates the blood. This form of absorption is most efficient when inhaling essential oils from a tissue (direct inhalation), diffusing them in a vaporizer, or adding them to your bathwater. When inhaling essential oils, the molecules travel through the air and enter the nose. In the nose there are 50 million smell receptors located at the top of the nasal cavity. These nerve cells are called 'cilia' and are part of an organ called the olfactory bulb (bulbus olfactorius). The olfactory bulb is connected to a part of the brain called the Limbic System which is responsible for emotions, memory and sexual arousal. Due to this connection to the brain, when used correctly the properties of essential oils have the power to affect our moods in a positive and balancing way.
