Editorial As one MIT researcher, Dr. Stephanie Seneff has already predicted, if the current trendcontinues unabated and if nothing is done to shift this momentum in a positive direction today, the incidence of Autism would be 1 in 2 children in the U.S by 2025. The statistics would be similar in other countries too as the accelerated increase in autismincidence and prevalence is being witnessed globally. This editorial seeks to discuss the underlying science behind the almost complete absence ofthe prevalence of autism in the Amish community and to highlight the urgency of implementing solutions in autism that are already showing results on the ground. As far as the science behind the secret to the absence of autism in the Amish community isconcerned, what I have chosen to do in this editorial is to present an overview of the factors contributing to this presentation in the Amish population, that can be explained by the cutting-edge emerging scientific disciplines in various fields. Psychoneuroimmunology Making a choice not to vaccinate their children is a well-known albeit controversial practice in the Amish population by and large. What has been largely overlooked and misunderstood as to how their immunity is robust without following the vaccination schedule as advised by conventional medicine is the psychoneuroimmunological basis that underlies their choices and hence the positive results they are experiencing as a result of those choices in the form of almost all their children being free from the symptoms of autism. Psychoneuroimmunology is the nascent scientific discipline that studies the interaction between the mind, body and social systems and how this interaction influences health and healing. The Amish community is world renowned for their way of life that is based on leading life in a manner that honors the intelligence of the cells of the body, trusting the signals that their bodies send that reveal what resonates with well-being and acting on those signals and impulses. Their social system and psychological conditioning therefore prepares the groundfor their choice to not vaccinate their children. This extends onto the widespread belief that most in the community hold on to tenaciously that in fact the opposite is true - vaccination, if they make the choice to do so, causes more harm than good. All the more so since the Amish community has become aware that they have somehow been made \"immune\" to the usual presentation of autism, because of their \"no vaccination\" mindset.This forms the psychological platform on which their immunological protection against not only most of the childhood illnesses the vaccines are supposed to prevent, but also the absence of manifestation of the debilitating symptoms of autism, is based. Biomedicine The more obvious biomedical basis for the absence of autism in the Amish community is the fact that throughout many centuries they have rigorously followed organic farming and have been consuming only organic produce grown mostly on their own farms, by themselves. Their food is therefore pesticide free and is consistently sustained as such over many generations. And the Amish continue to maintain the same till today. This practice reveals what may be interpreted as their belief and understanding of biomedicine as \"food being medicine\". This mindset and conditioning is again in alignment with their reverence for the land, respect for the values that they uphold, one such value being living in harmony with the forces of nature and viewing their food as being divine and pure. As the rest of the world is dealing with the rise in the debilitating symptoms in autism at least partially precipitated by genetically modified and pesticide-laden food, the Amish have been protected from the same. Energetic Immunity The term \"Energetic Immunity\" can be defined as the immunity generated by the system/beingin response to the chronically aligned state of energies of the individual or system. Quantum physics has discovered that everything in the universe is ultimately made up ofenergy. And this field of energy includes the mind, body and the ecosystem. This is the Energy Medicine perspective that provides the (w) holistic understanding of the almost complete absence of autism in the Amish population. The psychoneuroimmunological andbiomedical factors discussed above also fall under this umbrella of Energy Medicine. The Amish beliefs and practices discussed above translate as advantages to their wellbeing that is provided by maintaining a healthy and aligned Energy Field. More or less chronically or consistently, and this field of aligned energies is both at the micro as well as themacro level, at the molecular level as well as at the clinical level as evidenced by the lack of manifested symptoms of autism. The scientific community needs to focus more on what is actually working in autism so that more of the same can be replicated.Rajalakshmi K, Autism-Open Access 2015, 5:2 DOI: 10.4172/2165-7890.1000e131 Editorial open Autism-Open Access ISSN:2165-7890 2 e131Autism - Open AccessAutism: OpenAccess ISSN: 2165-7890What I have discussed above could form the platform for developing a multi- pronged approach in dealing with the symptoms in autism that has its foundation in Applied Energy Medicine that establishes the Energetic Immunity in the individual. So that the people with autism can be free from the limiting symptoms in autism and can thrive with their unique giftsand talents.The additional benefit of establishing such an Energetic Immunity in autism wouldbe the less susceptibility to other infections and conditions that most people with autism usually suffer from throughout their life span. Energetic Immunity being established in the autistic person regardless of the age of the person, using Applied Energy Medicine would thus decrease the morbidity and increase the longevity and the quality of life in the person. To get a clearer understanding of Applied Energy Medicine, it is recommended that myeditorials and articles on this subject are perused at www.intenthealing.com/blog . What is likely to raise opposing viewpoints would be the all too familiar Autism-Vaccine debate. And that need not interfere in the applying of the method that I am suggesting here, to see the results right away because it can be easily implemented in the already affectedchildren/people with autism who have already completed their vaccine schedule. The solution as suggested in this editorial can bepresented to all and the question of vaccination in therelevant category of children and parents can be left to the individual choice of the parents, in most cases. Because to wait would be a costly mistake. With the present statistics of 1 in 68 children being diagnosed with autism, why wait, when there are solutions in autism that are already working? [1-6].
