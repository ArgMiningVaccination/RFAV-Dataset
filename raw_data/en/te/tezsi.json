The survey contains 125 social and behavioral questions, covering a wide variety of topics, including health and stress, household and institution responses, and social and community engagement. James Druckman IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html)'s research focuses on political preference formation and communication. He is one of the principal researchers involved in conducting an ongoing [survey](https://covidstates.org) and analyzing weekly data on \"the state of the nation\" as part of a consortium of four universities\u2014Northwestern, Harvard, Northeastern, and Rutgers. Research Roundup Survey: Is the CDC Missing the Mark on Vaccination Rates? April 2023 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported rising COVID-19 vaccination rates since the start of the pandemic, but these data might give an overly optimistic view of how many Americans are actually vaccinated, according to a recent national [survey](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2023/survey-is-the-cdc-missing-the-mark-on-vaccination-rates.html) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html). The CDC estimates that over two years after the initial rollout of the first COVID-19 vaccine, 79% of the population has been vaccinated with two shots of Pfizer or Moderna or one shot of Johnson & Johnson. But according to the COVID States Project survey, conducted between December 2022 and January 2023, the figure is 73%, or 6 percentage points lower. As Social Lives Resume, a Mental Health Crisis Continues March 2023 Nearly three years into the pandemic, young adults are returning to their pre-pandemic social lives. Yet a mental health crisis among America's young adults persists, according to a recent national [survey](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2023/survey-depression-worsens-young-adults.html) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html). The survey confirms the pandemic's lingering impact on mental health for all Americans, but in particular for young adults: While 18- to 24-year-olds say they are going out more, their overall levels of depression have not fallen as much as one would have expected with the lifting of pandemic restrictions. And in a troubling discovery, just over one-third of them (34%) report thinking recently they would be better off dead or harming themselves. Survey: Half of Americans Uncertain About Ability to Identify False Political Claims February 2023 Only 8% of nearly 25,000 Americans correctly identified all false political claims presented to them as part of a recent [national survey](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/02/survey-half-of-americans-uncertain-about-ability-to-identify-false-political-claims/) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html). The survey also found that those who believed false vaccine statements were more than twice as likely to believe inaccurate claims about politics when compared with those who could correctly identify false vaccine claims. Twitter Use Dips After Elon Musk's Takeover, Largely Driven by Democrats' Departure February 2023 A national survey conducted before and after Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) [shows ](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2023/survey-twitter-use-dips-after-elon-musk-takeover.html)that its use dipped from around 32% of Americans in October to 30% in December and January. The decrease was largely driven by Democrats who left the platform, with 38% reporting they used it before Musk bought Twitter but only 33% reporting that they used it after he bought it. Use by Republicans and Independents declined slightly after Musk became CEO, but not significantly. Survey Looks at the State of the COVID-19 Pandemic at the End of 2022 December 2022 The new [report](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2022/survey-looks-at-the-state-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-2022.html) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) provides a snapshot of the state of the pandemic at the end of 2022, including case rates, vaccine and booster shot uptake, antiviral treatment usage, mask-wearing habits, and flu shot rates. It sheds light on the state of vaccinations and ongoing health risks at a time when the nation is experiencing a \"tripledemic,\" with flu, COVID-19, and the respiratory illness RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), circulating among Americans. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans Still Concerned About Russia's Invasion of Ukraine December 2022 As the war in Ukraine nears its one-year anniversary in February 2023, American news coverage of the conflict has dwindled. Despite the drop in media attention, the majority of Americans, or nearly 8 in 10, say that they are still very concerned or somewhat concerned about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to a national [survey](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2022/survey-nearly-8-in-10-americans-still-concerned-about-russias-invasion-of-ukraine.html) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html). Concern over the invasion was high across all political parties, with Democrats showing a higher level of concern (86%) compared to Republicans (76%) and independents (75%). A Slight Majority of Americans Approve of the FBI's Search of Mar-a-LagoOctober 2022 A [report](../../news/2022/survey-majority-of-americans-approve-of-fbi-search-of-mar-a-lago.html)by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html)and his colleagues finds that a slight majority of Americans (51%) approve of the search of Mar-a-Lago, but there is a partisan gap between those who support and oppose it. From August 11 to September 13, 2022, the researchers conducted a national survey of 26,616 Americans, and most of those surveyed, or 81%, were aware that the raid had taken place. A large majority of Democrats (84%) supported or strongly supported the search, compared to 13% of Republicans. Among Republicans, 64% opposed or strongly opposed the search, versus 3% of Democrats. Independents were nearly twice as likely to support the search as they were to oppose it. Close to a third, or 32%, of independents strongly supported the search, while almost another third (28%) neither supported nor opposed it. Survey: Governors' Approval Ratings Hold Steady Before November Elections September 2022 A national [survey](../../news/2022/survey-governors-biden-trump-approval-ratings-fall-2022.html) of more than 26,000 American voters from August 11 to September 13, 2022, reveals how governors might fare in their bids for another term. IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues find that the September 2022 average for all 50 governors is 40% for their overall handling of their state's affairs, with an average of 39% for their handling of the pandemic. This compares with an average of 42% for their overall performance and 47% for the pandemic in November 2021. Additionally, the researchers find a large \"partisan approval gap\" between Republican and Democratic incumbents, with Republican voters rating Republican governors lower than Democratic voters' ratings of Democratic governors. National Survey Investigates How Antivirals Are Used to Treat COVID-19 August 2022 A national [survey](https://osf.io/pvqwt/) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues reveals that only 11% of people infected with COVID-19 between May 2022 and early July were prescribed an antiviral therapy, suggesting Paxlovid is vastly underused despite being widely available. Researchers from Northwestern, Harvard, Rutgers, and Northeastern universities surveyed 24,414 Americans across all 50 states between June 8, 2022, and July 6, 2022. The results show that adults 65 and over have a higher rate of taking antivirals at 20%. There are gender gaps in usage, with men taking antivirals more than women (13% of men versus 9% of women). People with higher incomes also reported taking antivirals more (16% of Americans earning $100,000 or more versus 7% of those earning less than $25,000). After Supreme Court Ruling Overturned Roe v. Wade, Support for Abortion Increased July 2022 A national [survey](../../news/2022/survey-after-supreme-court-ruling-overturned-roe-v-wade-support-for-abortion-increased.html) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) shows that Americans' support for abortion increased overall after the Dobbs decision, and support is highest among individuals who say they are \"very likely\" to vote in November. The results highlight how the Dobbs decision could influence who shows up to vote in the midterm elections and who Americans would like to see control Congress. Between June 8 and July 6, researchers from Northwestern, Harvard, Rutgers, and Northeastern universities surveyed 24,141 participants about their support for abortion across nine different scenarios, such as when a pregnancy is caused by rape and once a fetal heartbeat is detected. They surveyed participants before and after the Dobbs decision was announced, with 16,265 responding before and 7,876 after. National Survey Examines Whether State Abortion Policies Represent Citizen Views July 2022 A national [poll ](https://osf.io/2aczd/)published by IPR political science [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) indicates that a majority of Americans in most states support life-saving abortion care\u2014and that states which have enacted laws banning abortion without an exception for rape are at odds with majorities of their own residents. But the poll also indicates that a smaller but still sizeable number of Americans continues to struggle with the issue, as indicated by an absence of responses to parts of the survey. Roughly around one-third of those surveyed did not voice their opinion in seven of the nine abortion scenarios asked about, with that figure dropping to one-quarter for cases of rape and cases where the mother's life was in danger. Parents Cite News and Government as Top Sources for Child Vaccine Info May 2022 A [report](https://osf.io/5m2jf/) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) seeking to understand where parents get information about vaccinating their children against COVID-19 found parents of vaccinated children and parents of unvaccinated children divided over the best sources of information. When given an open-ended response question about where they got information to decide whether to vaccinate their kids against COVID-19, health care professionals were the most commonly cited source of information overall, followed by news, government and online/social media sources. The widest gap in sources of information were between parents of vaccinated and unvaccinated children, with parents of vaccinated children relying more on health care professionals than the latter. Update on Executive Approval of Management of the Pandemic April 2022 A [report](https://www.covidstates.org/reports/executive-approval-2) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his co-authors examines Americans' approval of their governor's handling of the pandemic, as well as President Biden's management of it. The data show a downward trend for approval of all governors since the start of COVID-19. In particular, Republicans' support of governors has decreased since April 2020. They find that Republican approval of Democratic governors has decreased from 57% in April 2020 to 19% in April 2022. Republican approval for Republican governors has also dropped, from 77% in April 2020 to 44% in April 2022. The data show Americans' approval of President Biden's handling of the pandemic has generally been higher than President Trump's, but Biden's approval has been falling since the spring of 2021. Beliefs in COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation Are Declining, But 16% of Americans Still Hold Vaccine Misperceptions February 2022 IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues [conducted](https://osf.io/9ua2x/) a survey between December 22, 2021, and January 24, 2022, that asked 18,782 Americans about popular vaccine misinformation claims, as well as their trust in science, media, and the government. The results show that misinformation beliefs are declining, but 16% of Americans still hold vaccine misperceptions. Additionally, about half (46%) of respondents are uncertain about the accuracy of at least one vaccine misinformation statement. Update on Parent-Reported COVID-19 Vaccination Rates February 2022 A [report](https://osf.io/npbrv/) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues shows parent-reported COVID-19 vaccination rates for kids ages 12 to 18 grew 3 percentage points from September 2021 (54%) to January 2022 (57%). Additionally, the vaccination rate for children ages 5 to 11 increased 9 percentage points from November 2021 (27%) to January 2022 (36%). However, it also reveals the surge of the Omicron variant over the holidays does not appear to increase the reported likelihood that parents would vaccinate their children. Instead, the survey shows the likelihood of vaccinating kids under 12 decreased between November 2021 and January 2022. Is Violent Protest Against the Government Ever Justified? January 2022 From December 22, 2021 to January 24, 2022, IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues surveyed 22,961 Americans about their views on the justifiability of violence against the government. The study [reveals](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2022/02/nearly-one-quarter-of-americans-believe-violent-protest-against-the-government-can-ever-be-justified/) 23% of Americans believe engagement in violent protest against the government can ever be justified, with 10% saying it is justified now. Men, younger Americans, and liberals and conservatives who hold polarizing views of the other party are more likely than women, older Americans, and moderates to believe violent protest against the government is ever \"definitely\" or \"probably\" justified. Healthcare Workers Pinpoint Facebook as a Key Source of Vaccine Misinformation January 2022 From November 3 to December 3, IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues surveyed 545 healthcare workers to understand the role they believe misinformation plays in patients' healthcare decisions. A sizable majority [say](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2022/survey-new-insights-masks-test-kits-misinformation.html) misinformation is a negative influence on patients' decisions either to get vaccinated (72%) or to seek care (71%) once they fall ill with COVID. And one-third called such misinformation an \"urgent\" problem and the single most important factor influencing decisions to not get vaccinated. Up to 6% of Adult Cases Not Counted Due to Use of At-Home Test Kits January 2022 In survey of nearly 11,000 respondents conducted between December 27 and January 15, IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues [asked](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2022/survey-new-insights-masks-test-kits-misinformation.html) about COVID-19 testing and the use of at-home test kits. Of those surveyed, 63% report they had been tested for COVID-19 either in a testing facility or using an at-home test, 18% confirm they tested positive for COVID at least once, and 4% say they tested positive using a rapid antigen test at home. Most See N95 Masks as More Protective, But Only 1 in 5 Wears One January 2022 Data collected between December 22 and January 10 from a total of more than 17,000 Americans on mask use finds that two-thirds (66%) have correctly understood that N95 masks provide more protection than cloth masks, yet only 1 in 5 reports wearing one. The national survey by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) [finds](../../news/2022/survey-new-insights-masks-test-kits-misinformation.html) more than one-quarter (26%) of the more than 2,000 surveyed on recommended masks remain unsure if N95s offer more protection than cloth masks. Overall, 64% of all respondents say they still wear cloth masks as well as gaiters, bandanas, and scarves. (Respondents could pick more than one type of mask.) Nine percent say they never wore a mask. One Year After Capitol Insurrection Americans Remain Divided in Their Feelings About It January 2022 One year after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, a new survey by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) [finds](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2022/survey-one-year-after-capitol-insurrection.html) that 52% of Americans overall feel sadness and anger, and 49% feel shame about what happened, with Democrats expressing these emotions more (65%-71%) than Republicans (34%-41%) and Independents (45%-46%). While the report by researchers from Northwestern, Harvard, Northeastern, and Rutgers shows overall support for the insurrection is low\u2014with only 5 percent of all respondents saying they support it, opposition to it became more polarized in the intervening year. The February 2021 report [showed](https://osf.io/3qfs9/) a 15-percentage point gap between Republicans (74%) and Democrats (89%) who \"strongly or somewhat opposed\" the riot. The Majority of Americans Are Concerned with How American History Is Taught January 2022 Over the last few years, Critical Race Theory (CRT), an academic framework examining systemic racism within institutions, has made its way to the center of America's culture war, as the country grapples with how to teach about the history of racism in schools. A survey by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) assessing attitudes about CRT [ shows](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2022/survey-majority-americans-concerned-with-how-american-history-is-taught.html) that the majority of Americans, or 73%, across all demographics are concerned with how American history is taught in public schools. Roughly half of respondents (52%) expressed greater support for \"teaching about how racism continues to impact American society today\" compared to teaching CRT, which only 27% of those surveyed support. Over Half of All Parents Report Concerns About COVID-19 Vaccines for Their Kids January 2022 Will parents vaccinate their kids as pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations [rise](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-31/kids-covid-hospitalizations-reach-record-level-in-omicron-surge) across the United States? A new survey IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) [finds](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2022/survey-over-half-of-all-parents-report-concerns-about-covid-vaccines-for-their-kids.html) many parents continue to hold high levels of concern about the COVID-19 vaccine, and some concerns are more polarizing among parents. The report by researchers at Northwestern, Harvard, Rutgers, and Northeastern reveals over half of all parents surveyed in November continue to cite two major concerns about COVID-19 vaccines: 59% of parents report they are concerned about long-term side effects, and 57% state they are worried about whether the vaccine has been tested enough. Early Stages of Omicron Had Only a Modest Impact on Booster Uptake December 2021 A national survey by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) [finds](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2021/12/early-stages-of-omicron-had-only-a-modest-impact-on-booster-uptake/) that nearly half (47%) of previously vaccinated respondents are booster hesitant or resistant, showing only a modest change in conviction, even after the World Health Organization recently (WHO) announced the risk posed by the rapidly spreading omicron variant. While 30% of poll respondents overall indicated they had already received the COVID-19 booster shot, older adults and adults with post-secondary education, were the most likely to have received the booster shot. In the Last Year, 1 in 5 Adults Voted in a Local School Board Election December 2021 Conflicts around COVID-19 restrictions and teaching critical race theory have increased attention on school board elections and meetings. A new survey by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) [highlights](../../news/2021/survey-one-in-five-adults-voted-in-a-school-board-election.html) who votes in these elections and their top concerns when choosing a school board, as well as who attends school board meetings. The survey shows that 1 in 5 adults, or 22%, say they voted in a school board election over the last year. Of those voters, 14% say school safety and COVID-19 vaccines were their top concerns when choosing their school board, followed by 8% who reported that students' mental health and requiring face masks were the most important issues. Nearly One-Third of 5- to 11-Year-Olds Are Getting Vaccinated November 2021 A new survey by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues [finds](../../news/2021/survey-one-third-5-11-year-olds-getting-vaccinated.html) that parents who are Democrats, college-educated, city dwellers, and older (over age 35) were more likely to say their 5- to 11-year-olds were getting vaccinated over those who were not. But the survey also revealed worrying trends in vaccinating children who are now eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. Since June, the number of overall \"vaccine-enthusiastic\" parents\u2014those who had or said they were likely to get their children vaccinated no matter their age\u2014dropped by 7 percentage points from 64% to 57%. Students Are Happier if Their College Requires Vaccines November 2021 A new survey of more than 1,200 U.S. college students [shows](../../news/2021/survey-students-are-happier-if-their-college-requires-vaccines.html) those in colleges with mask and vaccine requirements were more likely to approve of their universities' handling of COVID-19 than those without mandates. The survey findings uncover how the wider, often contentious debates about vaccine and mask mandates are playing out on U.S. campuses, according IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues at Harvard, Northeastern, and Rutgers. In all, 66% of students said that they knew what their university's policy was, but only about two-thirds of those could accurately describe the details of the policy. This indicates that 44% of the students surveyed did not accurately understand the policy of their own institution. Why Do Unvaccinated Americans Wear Masks? October 2021 While 29% of Americans are still unvaccinated, nearly two-thirds of this group (19%) are concerned enough about the spread of COVID-19 to regularly wear a mask\u2014and the No. 1 reason for a large majority of them is concern about family members contracting COVID-19. IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) [uncovers](../../news/2021/survey-why-do-unvaccinated-americans-wear-masks.html) that 62.6 million Americans, or nearly one-fifth of the U.S. population, fall into this unvaccinated, mask-wearing group. The poll also finds high levels of worry over personally contracting COVID-19 among both vaccinated mask wearers (72%) and unvaccinated mask wearers (62%). And for both, their highest level of concern was for the welfare of their family members in possibly contracting COVID-19 (84% and 75%, respectively). Parents' Concerns About COVID-19 Vaccines Grew From June to September 2021 October 2021 IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues at Northeastern, Harvard, and Rutgers universities also [reveal](../../news/2021/survey-parents-concerns-about-covid-19-vaccines-grew.html) most parents are most concerned about the possible long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccines and if the vaccines underwent enough testing. Parents' concerns about the long-term effects spiked from 50% in June to 65% in September, while concerns about testing grew from 51% to 63%. Parents who report the most concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines include younger mothers ages 18 to 35, parents of young children, parents with unvaccinated children ages 12 to 18, Republicans and Independents, Black and Hispanic parents, parents without a college degree, and parents in rural areas. Support for Vaccine Mandates Remains High, While Approval Drops for the President's Handling of the Pandemic October 2021 The survey by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) [shows](../../news/2021/survey-most-americans-continue-to-support-vaccine-mandates.html) a majority would also support narrower vaccine mandates for students attending school or college and for travelers flying commercially. Six out of 10 Americans also support requiring large companies to either vaccinate or regularly tested their employees for COVID-19. Despite President Biden's actions to curb the spread of COVID-19 through vaccine mandates, another survey conducted at the same time finds that approval of his handling of the pandemic dropped from 57% in June to 49% by September. His approval ratings also declined across political parties, dropping by -5% among Democrats, -7% among Republicans, and -8% among Independents. Healthcare Workers Are More Vaccine Enthusiastic, But 27% Are Not Vaccinated August 2021 In February and March, IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues evaluated vaccine attitudes among healthcare workers. Now an August report revisits healthcare workers' attitudes and vaccination rates. As of July, the results [show](https://osf.io/yhk5j/) that 27% of healthcare workers are unvaccinated, and 15% are vaccine resistant. The survey suggests that without vaccine mandates, unvaccinated healthcare workers may remain unvaccinated. Additionally, healthcare workers appear to be more vaccine enthusiastic than the general population. Survey Investigates Parental Concerns About COVID-19 Vaccine August 2021 An August 2021 survey by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) [explores](https://osf.io/c2xmj/) parents' concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine for their kids. The researchers find the top concerns among parents are whether the vaccine has been tested enough (51%), the potential for lasting health effects (50%), and how new the vaccine is (46%). Additionally, the data show moms are more likely than dads to express concerns about COVID-19 vaccinations for their children. Their top concern is whether the vaccine has been tested enough (58%). Survey Explores Misinformation Beliefs Among Americans August 2021 Twenty percent of Americans believe at least one COVID-19 vaccine misinformation statement is true, according to an August 2021 [survey](https://osf.io/xtjad/) from a research consortium that includes Northwestern University. Additionally, IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues find more than half (51%) of the respondents report they are not sure whether to believe at least one false statement. The groups most likely to hold vaccine misperceptions include people aged 25-44, those with high socioeconomic status, and Republicans. Over 25% in each group said at least one false statement was true. What Do Americans Think About People Who Are Not Vaccinated? August 2021 According to the latest results from a national [survey](https://osf.io/fy6jz/) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html), Americans have more favorable feelings toward people who are vaccinated against COVID-19. Between June 9 and July 7, the researchers surveyed 20,669 people across the United States and explored people's thoughts about people who are not vaccinated. Using a thermometer scale from 0 to 100 degrees, the researchers find the average feeling toward vaccinated people is 78 degrees compared to 45 degrees for those who are not vaccinated. Survey Finds 64% of Americans Support Government Vaccine Mandates July 2021 As delta variant infections grow in the U.S., support for vaccine mandates is rising, too. A survey by IPR political scientist [James Druckman ](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html)and his colleagues from the COVID States Project [ finds](https://osf.io/6wcn9/) support for vaccine mandates increased from 58% in April to 64% in June. Between June 9 and July 7, the researchers surveyed 20,669 individuals across the U.S. and asked people whether they supported federal, state, and local government vaccination mandates. The results show strong support for government vaccine mandates in most states, with the highest in Massachusetts (81.1%) and lowest in Wyoming (45.7%). Is Facebook 'Killing Us'? A New Survey Investigates July 2021 Between June 9 and July 7, IPR political scientist [James Druckman ](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html)and his colleagues from the COVID States Project [asked](https://osf.io/uvqbs/) 20,669 people across the U.S. to name news sources they rely on for COVID-19 updates, vaccination rates and information. The researchers found Facebook is a significant source of COVID-19 news. Three in 10 people (33%) reported visiting Facebook in the last 24 hours to find news about COVID-19. People who relied on Facebook for COVID-19 news had substantially lower vaccination rates than the overall U.S. population. Additionally, those who received most of their news from Facebook displayed lower levels of institutional trust and greater acceptance of misinformation. Want to Vaccinate More Americans? Get Top Republicans to Endorse Vaccines July 2021 As the highly transmissible Delta variant pushes up cases of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. to alarming levels, President Joe Biden and other top administration officials have taken to the airwaves, urgently pressing more Americans to get vaccinated. But a new [study](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/32/e2106559118) shows that messages from top Democrats could actually deter Republicans, the most vaccine-hesitant group, from getting the life-saving vaccines. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html), along with researchers from Stanford and MIT, surveyed nearly 1,500 Republicans between March 17 and 24 about their willingness to get vaccinated and their likelihood to encourage others to do so. Survey Shows Growing Support for Vaccinating Children and School Vaccine Mandates July 2021 Children under 12 may be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines by September or October, but will parents vaccinate their children? New [survey](https://osf.io/fwker/) results from IPR political scientist [ James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues reveal that overall, Americans have grown more supportive of vaccinating children now than when compared to surveys taken earlier this year. Still, uneven trends emerge based on the respondents' age and gender. Young mothers and mothers of young children remain the most resistant to vaccinating their children. Social Isolation Is Down Overall, But Some Americans Remain Isolated July 2021 As states reopen and lift COVID-19 safety measures, a new [survey](https://osf.io/pfxnv/) of more than 185,000 people from all 50 states shows another sign of improvement\u2014levels of social isolation are falling. IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues looked at 15 months of data, finding that the percentage of socially isolated respondents fell most among people with high incomes and education. But those who are unemployed and poor remain more isolated than other segments of the population. The Economy and Pandemic Are Improving, Mental Health Is Not May 2021 Despite the optimism around the pandemic's progress, a national [survey](https://osf.io/cgfzt/) conducted by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) finds that depression and other mental health issues have not improved since the winter. Over a fourth (28%) meet moderate levels of depression that would result in evaluation and treatment. While the numbers have slightly decreased from 30% in December 2020, depression rates are three times the levels before the pandemic. More Americans Oppose Vaccine Passports Than Support Them May 2021 As more Americans receive the COVID-19 vaccine and communities begin re-opening, many remain divided about whether proof of vaccination, or \"vaccine passports,\" should be required to shop in person or travel. A new national [survey](https://osf.io/pnqr4/) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues [finds](../../news/2021/survey-attitudes-about-vaccine-passports.html) only 27% of respondents on average support vaccine passports, while 50% oppose them. Support for School Vaccination Requirements Rises from 54% to 58%, But Some Resistance Remains May 2021 Between April 1 and May 3, IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues surveyed 21,733 individuals across the country about their attitudes on childhood vaccinations. The results [indicate ](https://osf.io/stacj/)cities and Democratic-leaning states will be more likely to implement vaccination requirements: 76% of Democrats support them versus only 38% of Republicans and those in cities (66%) are more likely to be in favor of them than those in suburban (56%) and rural areas (49%). Americans Shift Toward \"Pro-Vaccine\" Direction After J&J Vaccine Pause April 2021 On April 13, the FDA and CDC recommended pausing the use of the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine. A new survey by a consortium of four universities, which includes IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html), [suggests ](https://osf.io/j5hf2/)the pause did not have negative effects on vaccination attitudes. Nearly 74% of respondents were aware of the pause, but vaccine hesitancy and resistance did not increase after the pause. However, respondents did show a vaccine preference after the pause. People preferred Pfizer over Moderna and they preferred Moderna over J&J. Vaccination Rates for Healthcare Workers Have Doubled March 2021 Since January, more U.S. healthcare workers have said they are ready to get vaccinated, with rates of vaccine hesitancy dropping from 37% to 29%, according to a new [ survey ](https://osf.io/a352z/)from a research consortium that includes IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html). The same survey finds a similar drop in the hesitancy rate for workers outside of healthcare, falling from 41% to 31%. The survey also shows the rate of vaccination has doubled among healthcare workers, and those with a graduate degree have been vaccinated at four times the rate of those with a high school degree or less (43% versus 13%). Survey Shows 53% of Americans Support Biden's Handling of COVID-19 March 2021 A new [survey](https://osf.io/shveq/) looks at how much Democrats and Republicans approve, or disapprove, of their governors and the president's handling of COVID-19. IPR political scientist [James Druckman](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues found Republicans are generally more disapproving of their governors\u2014even more so when their governor is a Democrat. Meanwhile, Democrats have increased their ratings for all governors on average, especially Republican ones. The research is part of an ongoing national survey of more than 170,000 Americans between April 2020 and February 2021. Survey Shows Parents Are More Hesitant to Get Vaccines for Their Kids March 2021 Between February 5 and March 1, IPR political scientist [James Druckman](#) [surveyed ](https://osf.io/e95bc/)more than 19,700 individuals to determine whether parents are more skeptical of coronavirus vaccines than other adults. The survey results show parents are more hesitant about getting the coronavirus vaccine for themselves and their children than those without children across different socioeconomic and demographic groups, with young mothers driving the gap. Mothers between the ages of 18 and 35 are a third less likely to get the vaccine as soon as it becomes available and nearly a third more likely to refuse it altogether. Mothers are also more skeptical of vaccines than fathers: 27% of mothers say they are extremely unlikely to vaccinate their children versus 14% of fathers. New Survey Shows Wide Gaps in Who Is Getting Vaccinated March 2021 A new national [ survey ](https://osf.io/rnw8z/)of more than 21,000 Americans underscores that wide disparities still exist in terms of who has been able to get a vaccine so far. It also pinpoints how a complex system of vaccine distribution cuts off the people best placed to convince more vulnerable Americans to get one. The researchers, including IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) conducted the survey between February 5 and March 1. They find that education was the biggest predictor of who had already been vaccinated: 29% of respondents with graduate degrees had already received their COVID shots versus just 9% of those with a high school diploma or less, and the figures were similar for vaccine hesitancy (8% vs. 30%). National Survey Shows 13% of Healthcare Workers Are Vaccinated February 2021 In new national survey by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) while healthcare workers held similar attitudes to most Americans on their hesitancy in, and resistance to, getting vaccinated, they were more likely to be [vaccinated](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/reports/covid-survey-vaccine-attitudes-healthcare-workers.pdf) overall (13%) than Americans generally (2%) since they are on the COVID frontlines as essential workers. The survey finds that education, income, gender, and race/ethnicity are strong predictors of vaccination rates, as well as of vaccine hesitancy and resistance among those at the frontlines of the fight against COVID-19. Two-Thirds of Parents Voice Concern About Students' Learning Losses February 2021 Two-thirds of respondents (67%), whether students or parents, say they are concerned about the quality of K-12 learning during the pandemic, according to a new national [survey ](https://kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2038%20EDUCATION%20Feb%202021.pdf) of more than 25,000 people by Northwestern, Northeastern, Rutgers, and Harvard universities, including IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html). The finding holds across respondents from different racial backgrounds, incomes, and political affiliations. Gun Sales Spike in 2020 February 2021 A new national [survey](https://kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2037%20GUNS%20Feb%202021.pdf) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) that took place between December 16 and January 11 shows nearly 9,000 of 25,000 Americans said they [bought](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2021/survey-gun-sales-spike-in-2020.html) guns in 2020. Protesters of police violence or people who attended a rally in support of former President Trump were approximately between 2 and 4 times more likely to buy a gun than those who did not attend. For those who attended a protest against police violence or racism, 13% bought a gun. But that increased to 23% for those attending a rally to support Trump or to protest election fairness or COVID-19 restrictions. National Survey Finds Most Americans Favor Vaccination January 2021 As President Joe Biden promises to vaccinate more than 100 million Americans by the end of his first 100 days in office (April 29), new [research](https://kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2035%20VACCINES%20Jan%202021.pdf) offers several critical insights for those in charge of managing such a massive national public health effort. IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) and his colleagues [surveyed](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2021/survey-americans-vaccines-misinformation-beliefs-research-insights.html) show that Americans generally favor getting a vaccination themselves (75%) and do not typically believe COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, though certain groups are more likely to believe false information about vaccines. They are also more likely to be swayed to get vaccinated by [messages](https://kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2036%20VACCINE%20COMM%20Jan%202021.pdf) from their doctors and scientists than those from famous political figures, athletes, or actors, and generally agree with current policies prioritizing which groups should get vaccinated first, such as frontline medical personnel and first responders. As Latest Relief Package Passes, 1 in 5 Americans Confronts Severe Economic Hardships December 2020 A new [survey](https://kateto.net/covid19//COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2030%20ECONOMY%20DEC%202020.pdf) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) reveals the dismal scope of many Americans' economic struggles as Congress approves an eleventh-hour $900 billion pandemic relief package before remaining benefits expire at the end of December. Between November 3 and 30, the researchers asked roughly 20,000 individuals across the United States and Washington, D.C. about five key economic hardships: unemployment, pay cuts, evictions, making rent or a house payment, and stopping or cutting work to take care of children. As Coronavirus Cases Jump, Illinoisans Slip in Following Public Health Guidelines November 2020 As COVID-19 cases in Illinois surge past spring's high point, a new [survey](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/reports/covid19-consortium-report-27-illinois-nov-2020.pdf) examining people's behaviors in the state shows that colder weather driving people indoors and COVID fatigue are likely behind the virus' deadly second wave. The number of COVID-19 cases in Illinois has increased sharply over the last two months from about 2,000 cases per day in late September to a seven-day rolling average of roughly 12,000 daily cases since mid-November. \"The numbers are not promising in terms of what to expect in the coming months,\" said IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html). \"It seems that necessary behaviors are slipping, and this could put extreme strain on our healthcare infrastructure.\" More Wearing Masks But Fewer Staying Six Feet Apart November 2020 As the United States waits to see how high already grim rates of COVID-19 will go after Thanksgiving, a new [survey](https://kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2026%20BEHAVIOR%20NOV%202020) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) shows that the states with the lowest levels of social distancing behaviors and mask wearing since the pandemic started are enduring the most severe outbreaks now. Researchers tracked how closely more than 139,000 people followed public health recommendations over 10 waves of surveys from April to November 2020 in every state plus the District of Columbia. Most Americans Support Restrictive Measures to Curb COVID-19 November 2020 Despite differing opinions about whether shutdowns have been effective, new [survey](https://kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2025%20MEASURE%20v2%20NOV%202020.pdf) results by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) show 6 in 10 Americans support more restrictive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Following the election, researchers surveyed nearly 20,000 individuals across the nation between November 3 and 23. They asked about seven key restrictions: staying at home, gathering in large groups, closing businesses, limiting restaurants to carry-out, prohibiting in-person K-12 classes, canceling events, and restricting travel. Another [survey](https://kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2026%20BEHAVIOR%20NOV%202020) finds more people are also wearing masks but fewer are staying six feet apart. States with lowest rates of distancing and mask wearing now suffering the worst COVID outbreaks. Depression Among Young Adults Soars During Pandemic November 2020 A new [survey](http://www.kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2023%20MENTAL%20HEALTH%20NOV%202020.pdf) of over 8,900 young adults, aged 18-24, across the U.S. finds that they showed higher levels of depression amid the pandemic, no matter their gender, racial or ethnic group, or geographic location. Nearly half (47%) of those surveyed described having at least moderate symptoms of depression. More urgently, over a third (37%) reported occasional thoughts that they might be better off dead, or had thoughts of harming themselves\u2014a tenfold increase in the rate prior to the pandemic. \"In terms of long-term consequences of COVID-19, the mental health of young people may be one of the most important,\" said IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html), who co-leads the survey. Which Issues Top Americans' Minds as They Vote? November 2020 As the nation heads into Election Day, a [survey](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/reports/covid19-consortium-report-21-important-issues-oct-2020.pdf) by IPR political scientist [James Druckman](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/druckman.html) of more than 20,000 American voters on the most important problems facing the U.S. finds their top answers, including the coronavirus at No. 1 overall, align more with issues that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has focused on during his campaign. The researchers show that COVID-19 topped the list for voters in every state but Alaska, where 16% of respondents chose climate change instead. Other first-picks mentioned were racism (10% ranked it first), the economy (8%), healthcare (7%), and crime and violence (6%). Belief in American Exceptionalism Declines July 2020 According to IPR sociologist [Beth Redbird](../../who-we-are/faculty-experts/redbird.html)'s [survey results](https://coronadata.us/), there has been a decline in Americans' belief in U.S. exceptionalism compared to other countries when it comes to institutions such as the healthcare system and the economy. Even institutions seemly unaffected by the pandemic, such as the military and the criminal justice system took a hit. Throughout the pandemic, Americans have developed more negative attitudes about the Republican Party, while attitudes about the Democratic Party have largely been stable. "}
