As my presidential year comes to a close at the Annual Scientific Meeting, I am honored to have served in this role, and I'm gratified to look back on what the College has accomplished so far in 2022. Membership continues to grow. This year we surveyed our members to find out how the College is meeting their needs. It's gratifying to hear what members value most about the College: Staying up to date with the latest developments for the specialty; interacting with colleagues and peers; benefiting from advocacy efforts related to the specialty; having access to free MOC, CME and clinical and practice management resources; and contributing our knowledge and voice to advance the specialty. This summer, we achieved a goal that I've been working toward since early 2021. In response to member concerns, we launched our biggest outreach campaign in more than 10 years. Our goal is to tell primary care physicians about the unique qualifications of board-certified and fellowship-trained allergists and what sets us apart from other providers of allergy services. The \"Time for an Allergist\" campaign has already garnered tens of thousands of views from our target audience of PCPs as well as the public, and I hope that many of you - our members - have engaged with this effort on the local level. This digital advertising campaign will run until February. Check out the campaign at TimeForAnAllergist. com and look for our member toolkit to help you market your practice. The toolkit is found on the College homepage and on the Practice Management Center page of college.acaai.org In line with the continued strategic priorities that came out of Vision Forward, this year we expanded our practice management and educational resources. Just a few highlights: Our Telehealth and Coding toolkits were revamped; our Risk & Compliance toolkit was INSIDE 9 4 3 6 Practice Management Programs Just for Fellows-in-Training Named lectures Exhibit hall map see PRESIDENT, page 6 Mark Corbett, MD, FACAAI, ACAAI presidentHonored to serve our members The Annual Meeting at your fingertips Use the meeting app to stay up to date during the meeting Keep track of symposia, abstracts, social events and more during the Annual Meeting with our mobile app. Download the app to access the full educational program, navigate the meeting with helpful maps, get local information and more.

Hours: 2:00 - 6:00 pm, Friday 9:00 am - 4:30 pm, Saturday 9:00 am - 1:30 pm, Sunday 6 2022 Annual Scientific Meeting November 10-14, 2022 Louisville updated to reflect new regulations, including the No Surprises Act and Information Blocking Rule. Our Biologics toolkit has been updated as new treatments have become available; our new Chronic Rhinosinusitis yardstick was published, and a new FIT Toolkit was developed with a bundle of practice management resources for new allergists starting their careers. In addition to another stellar Annual Scientific Meeting this year we added to our popular MicroCME bite-sized learning product with topics including sleep, urticaria, pediatric food allergy and more. In 2022 we (fortunately) saw less need to provide new and original resources related to COVID-19; however, we made substantive and frequent updates to our COVID-19 guidance on vaccines and our COVID-19 Resource Center. We continued our popular COVID-19 NewsBrief. As long as there is a need, we will stay on top of this and other public health priority issues as they affect allergists/immunologists and our patients. One of my priorities for this year was to continue the emphasis on racial disparities and health equity that my predecessor, Dr. Fonacier, set into motion. In February, the College hosted an important Roundtable on Racial Disparities in AD and Food Allergy, with a variety of interested organizations attending and contributing. Their discussion and recommendations will be published soon. The College created and translated more patient education materials than ever into Spanish, which we are committed to doing into the future. We also are looking at how best to provide patient materials that speak to people of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and we continue our programs meant to encourage more people of color to join the medical profession and the allergy profession. In addition, the Allergists' Foundation is supporting several community grants in this area. I encourage you to learn about the work of the foundation and to support it if you can. Our Advocacy Council continued to build on its work with our Asthma Alternative Payment Model, and to monitor regulations and advise changes that will promote allergists and the allergy specialty while reducing administrative burdens. We were fortunate to be able to carry out our Strike Force meetings on Capitol Hill in May, with a focus on preventing payment reductions to health care providers, permanently extending Medicare telehealth coverage policies, and eliminating administrative burdens. There is much more that has been accomplished so far this year, and I have no doubt that even more will be accomplished before we ring in 2023. None of this work would happen without the tireless efforts of our volunteers, who give of their time and expertise on task forces, committees, the Board of Regents, editorial boards and other leadership roles. I hope that each and every member of the College has found ways to engage with YOUR professional organization, and to contribute to the work of advancing our profession in 2022. The Practice Management Program - for physicians too! There are a variety of sessions devoted to managing an allergy practice, and they're geared toward physicians as well as office practice administrators and nurse managers. Start with the Practice Management Program on Friday. All physicians can attend, and no registration is required! Allergists will find plenty of sessions covering issues you and your staff deal with on a day-to-day basis - and all sessions are eligible for CME credit. All sessions are in the convention center, room M112: Coding Update (8:00 - 9:30 am) - Get updated on ICD-10 and CPT coding changes for allergists. Tips to Survive and Thrive in Solo/ Small Group Practice/Marketing Tactics in the Post-COVID Era (10:00 - 11:30 am) - Get practical ideas for success in an increasingly competitive environment and marketing tips to promote your practice.

Another valuable session is Coding and Government Relations on Sunday (1:00 - 2:30 pm, convention center rooms M101- M103). This session will address relevant changes, modification and implementation of CPT and ICD-10 coding. Plan to attend these sessions and leave with sound advice on running your practice. PRESIDENT Continued from page 1 Celebrating the College's 80th anniversary The College celebrates its 80th anniversary this year. Did you know: The College began as the American College of Allergists in November 1942. The first annual meeting of the College was held in 1944 in Chicago. Dr. Jonas Salk, the famed virologist who developed the first effective polio vaccine, gave a presentation titled \"Is There a Need for Immunologic Adjuvants?\" at the College's annual meeting in 1971. For a trip down memory lane, stop by the College Resource Center's display of historical documents and allergy books. You'll see antique remedies such as Dr. R. Schiffmann's Asthmador Cigarettes, Hunt's Salve (for itch in all its various forms), a Physician's Lipstick Testing Kit, and more! The exhibit hall closes on Sunday at 1:30 pm. Want more history? Plan to attend the ACAAI Opening Ceremony at 7:20 am in the convention center's Ballroom ABC. Joseph A. Bellanti, MD, FACAAI (Emeritus) will provide an interesting look at the College's 80 years of serving our members and the patients we care for. 7 #ACAAI22 CollegeAdvantage Friday-Saturday, Biologics .................................

ASCENIV is the only IVIG produced from blending RSV plasma and normal source plasma1 1. Data on File, ADMA Biologics. www.asceniv.com Focused on what matters most: safety, quality, and efficacy Indication ASCENIV (immune globulin intravenous, human - slra) is a 10% immune globulin liquid for intravenous injection, indicated for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI) in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age). PI includes, but is not limited to, the humoral immune defect in congenital agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), linked agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and severe for ASCENIV Contraindications ASCENIV is contraindicated in: Patients who have had an anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to the administration of human immune globulin. IgA-deficiency patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity. Warnings and Precautions Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur with IGIV products, including ASCENIV. In case of hypersensitivity, discontinue ASCENIV infusion immediately and institute appropriate treatment. Patients with known antibodies to IgA may have a greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Thrombosis may occur following treatment with immunoglobulin products and in the absence of known risk factors. Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity and ensure adequate hydration before administration. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer ASCENIV at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity. Acute renal dysfunction/failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death may occur upon use of human IGIV products. Ensure that patients are not volume depleted before administering ASCENIV. Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk of developing acute renal failure. Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of ASCENIV and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Discontinue ASCENIV if renal function deteriorates. In at risk patients, administer ASCENIV at the minimum infusion rate practicable. Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, and hyponatremia or pseudohyponatremia may occur in patients receiving IGIV treatment, including ASCENIV. It is critical to clinically distinguish true hyponatremia from a pseudohyponatremia that is associated with or causally related to hyperproteinemia. Treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity, and a possible predisposition to thrombotic events. Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) may occur with IGIV treatments, including ASCENIV. AMS usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IGIV treatment. AMS may occur more frequently in association with high doses (2 g/kg) and/or rapid infusion of IGIV. Conduct a thorough neurological examination on patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of AMS, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. IGIV products, including ASCENIV, may contain blood group antibodies that can act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells (RBCs) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and hemolysis. Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis, including appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur with IV administered IG. Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. If suspected, perform appropriate tests for presence of anti-neutrophil in both product and patient serum. May be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support. Because ASCENIV is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. All infections suspected by a physician to possibly have been transmitted by this product should be reported to ADMA Biologics at (1-800-458-4244). After infusion of immunoglobulin, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient's blood may yield positive serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens (e.g., A, B, and D) may cause a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs') test. Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions to ASCENIV ( 5% of study subjects) were headache, sinusitis, diarrhea, gastroenteritis viral, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and nausea. You are encouraged to report side effects of prescription drugs to ADMA Biologics @ 1-800-458-4244 or the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/MedWatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088. For additional safety information about ASCENIV, please see full Prescribing Information.WARNING: THROMBOSIS, RENAL DYSFUNCTION AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products, including ASCENIV. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors. Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death may occur with the administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV) products in predisposed patients. Renal dysfunction and acute renal failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IGIV products containing sucrose. ASCENIV does not contain sucrose. For patients at risk of thrombosis, renal dysfunction or renal failure, administer ASCENIV at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity.IT'S WHAT'SINSIDE THATCOUNTSFor patients with primary humoral immunodeficiency TO LEARN MORE \u00a9 2022 ADMA Biologics.
