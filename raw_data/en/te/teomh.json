MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PAR-6 TICIPATION. 7 (a) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress finds the following: 8 (1) While significant progress has occurred due 9 to the establishment of the airport disadvantaged 10 business enterprise program (sections 47107(e) and 11 47113 of title 49, United States Code), discrimina- 12 tion and related barriers continue to pose significant 13 obstacles for minority- and women-owned businesses 14 seeking to do business in airport-related markets 15 across the Nation. These continuing barriers merit 16 the continuation of the airport disadvantaged busi- 17 ness enterprise program. 18 (2) Congress has received and reviewed testi- 19 mony and documentation of race and gender dis- 20 crimination from numerous sources, including con- 21 gressional hearings and roundtables, scientific re- 22 ports, reports issued by public and private agencies, 23 news stories, reports of discrimination by organiza- 24 tions and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits. 25 VerDate Nov 24 2008 12:01 Sep 24, 2018 testimony and documentation shows that race- 1 and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to 2 address the problem. 3 (3) This testimony and documentation dem- 4 onstrates that discrimination across the Nation 5 poses a barrier to full and fair participation in air- 6 port-related businesses of women business owners 7 and minority business owners in the racial groups 8 detailed in parts 23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Fed- 9 eral Regulations, and has impacted firm develop- 10 ment and many aspects of airport-related business 11 in the public and private markets. 12 (4) This testimony and documentation provides 13 a strong basis that there is a compelling need for the 14 continuation of the airport disadvantaged business 15 enterprise program and the airport concessions dis- 16 advantaged business enterprise program to address 17 race and gender discrimination in airport-related 18 business. 19 (b) P ROMPT PAYMENTS .\u2014 20 (1) R EPORTING OF COMPLAINTS .\u2014Not later 21 than 120 days after the date of enactment of this 22 Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Ad- 23 ministration shall ensure that each airport that par- 24 ticipates in the Program tracks, and reports to the 25 VerDate Nov 24 2008 12:01 Sep 24, 2018 Administrator, the number of covered complaints 1 made in relation to activities at that airport. 2 (2) I MPROVING COMPLIANCE .\u2014 3 (A) I N GENERAL .\u2014The Administrator 4 shall take actions to assess and improve compli- 5 ance with prompt payment requirements under 6 part 26 of title 49, Code of Federal Regula- 7 tions. 8 (B) C ONTENTS OF ASSESSMENT .\u2014In car- 9 rying out subparagraph (A), the Administrator 10 shall assess\u2014 11 (i) whether requirements relating to 12 the inclusion of prompt payment language 13 in contracts are being satisfied; 14 (ii) whether and how airports are en- 15 forcing prompt payment requirements; 16 (iii) the processes by which covered 17 complaints are received and resolved by 18 airports; 19 (iv) whether improvements need to be 20 made to\u2014 21 (I) better track covered com- 22 plaints received by airports; and 23 (II) assist the resolution of cov- 24 ered complaints in a timely manner; 25 VerDate Nov 24 2008 12:01 Sep 24, (706180|15)75 (v) whether changes to prime con- 1 tractor specifications need to be made to 2 ensure prompt payments to subcontractors; 3 and, 4 (vi) whether changes to prime con- 5 tractor specifications need to be made to 6 ensure prompt payment of retainage to 7 subcontractors. 8 (C) R EPORTING .\u2014The Administrator shall 9 make available to the public on an appropriate 10 website operated by the Administrator a report 11 describing the results of the assessment com- 12 pleted under this paragraph, including a plan to 13 respond to such results. 14 (3) D EFINITIONS .\u2014In this subsection, the fol- 15 lowing definitions C OVERED COMPLAINT .\u2014The term 17 ''covered complaint'' means a complaint relating 18 to an alleged failure to satisfy a prompt pay- 19 ment requirement under part 26 of title 49, 20 Code of Federal Regulations. 21 (B) P ROGRAM .\u2014The term ''Program'' 22 means the airport disadvantaged business en- 23 terprise program referenced in subsection (a)(1) 24 VerDate Nov 24 2008 12:01 (706180|15)76 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 1 2012 (49 U.S.C. 47113 note). 2 SEC. 158.
