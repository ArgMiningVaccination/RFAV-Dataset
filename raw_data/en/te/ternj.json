The four Protocol formulas enhance the normal eliminatory processes of the body. Unlike harsh laxatives, irritating diuretics and strong cholagogues (substances that stimulate emptying of the gallbladder and flow of bile), the herbs that are included in this protocol work via multiple eliminatory pathways as a healthy and safe way of supporting excretion of metabolic wastes, while improving digestion, nutrient absorption, circulation, cellular regeneration, and immune function. Weight loss is often a side effect, but not the primary intention. David Winston RH(AHG) also includes dietary guidelines to enhance the protocol.
