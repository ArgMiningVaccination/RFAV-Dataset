Like most Native American ceremonies, each ceremony differs from tribe to tribe and from person to person. There are many reasons why people engage in the smudging ceremony, and it often becomes a ceremony that connects them with the Creator on a regular basis. By definition, smudging is a ceremony that consists of burning plant herbs and resins in either a clay or shelled bowl while engaged in prayer. The burning of these plants forms smoke clouds that are believed to cleanse the air and those within it of negative energy. Smudging is, in fact, the most popular ceremony used to cleanse people and places of negative energy. The smoke from this ceremony also is symbolized as a way to carry prayer and positive affirmations to the Creator, Mother Earth, and the ancestors. Cultural Healing How Often Does Sunrise do Smudging Ceremonies? At Sunrise, we try to make smudging accessible to all who are in our care. Each sober community has an altar with sage and tobacco available. At our clinics, we also have bundles of sage available if they would like to smudge before or after group or Indvidual sessions. That release of negative thoughts and energies is often needed as people struggle with cravings. When Elders hold Talking Circles Ceremonies at Sunrise, we always start that ceremony with smudging as it is a way to invite our ancestors and the Creator to be present at the talking circle ceremony. Messages to the Great Spirit are said to be carried better when smoke is present and prayers for wellness and recovery are most certainly the kind of healing we encourage here at Sunrise. Smudging Herbs and Plants There are many different herbs and plants that are used during this ceremony. Many of these herbs are linked to their tribe's traditions. Surprisingly most of the herbs that are used to smudge have antiseptic features, meaning that when burned, they legitimately do purify the air. Sage - Sage, both Saliva Apiana (white sage) and Salvia Officinalis (common sage) are healing herbs used. The term \"Salvia\" comes from the Latin word \"salvare,\" which means \"to feel healthy and well and healing.\" Sage has long been held sacred by many Native Americans because of its effective purifying energies. Burning sage is thought to improve overall well-being, provide balance, cleanses the body and mind of negative spirits, and allows individuals to connect to the spiritual realm. Long utilized in smudging ceremonies, it is also said to enhance intuition, improve mood and cognition, and ward off negativity and toxicity. Since sage is grown in many different regions of the United States, the practice of drying, wrapping sage or bundling sage can be considered a ceremony in itself as prayers to Mother Earth, positive energy, and songs are often done while wrapping and drying. Cedar - Cedar wood has antioxidant, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties and can be used to purify your home. It has restorative uses when mixed as a tea, where it can aid in fighting infections. Cedar is used in sweat lodges and is often used in smudging. Western Red Cedar leaves have long been a popular internal and external medicine for painful joints among Coastal Native Tribes. Cedar is popular for cleaning and purifying, eliminating the evil spirits within people and objects to remediate balance. Burning cedar is also used to promote positivity and deeply connect humans to the spiritual world. The cedar is often broken down into sticks or chips to burn. The leaves or small branches can be dried and bundled, often like sage, to best be utilized for the ceremony. Cedar wood and their dried leaves and branches can also be used in the Sweat Lodge ceremony due to the cedars cleansing abilities. Sweetgrass - Sweetgrass is well known by each tribe and has a deep seeded history in many different tribes. Known as the hair of Mother Earth, resembling kindness, and widely used by all Native Americans, sweetgrass is believed to carry prayers into the Spirit World. Not only is sweetgrass used for ceremony, but also used as medicine and basket weaving material. Sweetgrass is often braided and the history of braiding sweetgrass can be best described in Marty Stomping-Elk's story of braiding sweetgrass and the significance of each blade of sweetgrass. Sweetgrass braids are often burned at the beginning of a prayer or ceremony to attract positive energy. The smoke from the herbs is said to take the words and transition them over to the Spirit World. It is also known as \"holy grass\" and when it burns it does not produce an open flame, but a sweetly scented smoke. It is said that the sweet-smelling smoke cleanses the spirit and brings sacred messages to the higher planes of existence. Tobacco - Tobacco is considered a sacred medicine. In many different cultures, tobacco is firmly believed to be a bridge between the Seen World and the Unseen World. Ceremonial tobacco is different from tobacco you'd find in pre-roll cigarettes. Commerical tobacco that you'd find in cartons with flashy logos and labeled cartons/containers can contain carcinogens or chemicals that are used to slow burning or flavoring, but ceremonial tobacco is grown and dried with care and does not contain additives. Not all commercial brands contain additives, and some brands can be trusted to be used for ceremony. Tobacco is often left as an offering to Mother Earth in many ceremonies and does not have to be burned to have ceremonial significance. What Happens During a Smudging Ceremony? Once again, smudging ceremonies can differ from tribe to tribe as herbs, stones, and other symbolic items can be involved. But to keep it general, a bundle of sage, an abalone seashell, a feather, and fire (lighter or matches are fine) is needed. All of the elements are represented in this ceremony - sage for Earth, the Abalone seashell for water, fire and smoke for fire, and feather for air- as prayers, positive energy, and songs are what is communicated to the Spirit World. The ceremony begins with lighting the bundle of sage on fire. It is said that \"Wakan Tanka\" (Great Spirit) understood messages better if delivered by smoke than those said with words. So as the sage begins to smolder, the fire is blown out and the smoke from the sage is then taken through each room of the house cleansing each room of negative energy. Songs and prayers are often thought or projected into the world as the cleansing of each room is done. This is where the person holding the bundle of sage can then place it in the seashell and carry it from room to room wafting the smoke with the feather. If a person is being cleansed, that person is often asked to close their eyes and inhale the smoke of the sage while communicating to the Unseen World. Prayers, positive imagery and the visualization of negative energy leaving the spirit is what is asked of the person. Everyone is different and this ceremony is often very personal as each person communicates with the Creator differently and asks or prayers for different things. Once you are finished, bring the ashes from the herbs outside and return them back to the soil. This signifies the energy being given back to the earth and shows respect. As you can see, burning herbs such as sage and cedar holds so much more meaning than simply forming a cloud of smoke while saying a prayer. "}
