The beneficial effects of Chinese herbal medicine may take 2-3 weeks to begin. This is because the herbal medicine formulae is/are all natural and plant based and offer the medicinal products in a natural balance and natural concentration levels. This is unlike pharmaceutical medicines (drugs) which deliver singular or synthetically combined chemical products at higher doses. These have a more rapid effect than natural products but are more likely to cause adverse effects or side effects.

Dr. Christine Cui's clinic uses Chinese herbal medicine and Acupuncture to improve wellbeing and to manage symptoms and signs of infertility in both women and men. Infertility issues by nature are very complex as successful fertility requires the combination of healthy gametes (sperm and ova) from 2 individuals, with individual health issues. The female's and the males' physical and mental health and wellbeing are paramount in maximising a couple's fertility. Dr Cui's clinical approach to Chinese herbal medicine and Acupuncture is incorporated into a holistic health care management approach for women and men to support their improved fertility which includes vital behavioural, physical and nutrtional components. The approach of Dr. Cui in fertility and wellbeing improvement through traditional Chinese medicine (Herbal medicine and Acupuncture) strategies is well suited as a support treatment during Western medicine fertility treatments (Hormonal Therapy, Harvesting, Embryo Transfers) In some circumstances, where Western medicine fertility intervention is not an option, Chinese medicine is an ideal and natural alternative. The Australian community is very open to natural health care approaches and natural Chinese medicine fertility support is quite popular in Melbourne and Australia. \"Our review suggests that the management of female infertility with Chinese herbal medicine can improve pregnancy rates 2-fold within a 3-6 month period compared with Western medical fertility drug therapy. In addition, fertility indicators such as ovulation rates, cervical mucus score, biphasic basal body temperature, and appropriate thickness of the endometrial lining were positively influenced by CHM therapy, indicating an ameliorating physiological effect conducive for a viable pregnancy\". - Reid k (Source: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637159](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637159)) Our Melbourne Chinese herbal medicine clinic in the heart of the CBD uses safe substances derived from nature to regulate the body's internal processes and internal organs.
