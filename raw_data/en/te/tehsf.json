Lavender is just fine, I've been using that and I'm in week 36. I agree with the above IF you make sure it is ready for your skin. Some oils are concentrated and need to be mixed with coconut oil before you put it on your skin. I didn't use it on my skin, but I used bottles of peppermint and lemongrass oils during my pregnancy to smell when I would get nauseated. smelling essential oils is my fav thing during pregnancy. especially because burning candles is so toxic and so are air fresheners and fragrances. there's many things that are a big 'NO' in pregnancy like herbs, supplements, teas, essential oils. Since there's not many studies on how they effect pregnancy, they are all ruled unsafe. My advice is u don't have to follow that and stay away from everything. But look up the known harmful ones. And use anything in moderation, don't overdo the essential oils or tea. A little it fine but use your common sense, don't use essential oils in a way that's unsafe for even a non pregnant person. i use mine daily and my baby is perfect, im 33 weeks :) - 1 - 1 You May Also Like [PregnancyAre Essential Oils Safe During Pregnancy?](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/aromatherapy) [ProductsBest Products to Help Minimize Stretch Marks](//www.whattoexpect.com/baby-products/pregnancy/best-stretch-mark-creams-oils-balms-helping-pregnant-women/) [PregnancyPregnancy Nutrition Chart: 32 Essential Nutrients for Pregnant Women](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/diet/pregnancy-nutrition-chart/) [ProductsProducts to Make Pregnancy Sex More cleaner!September 10, 2023 | by boy-mom12Hello mamas!
