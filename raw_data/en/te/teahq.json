I put the quotes on 'health care' because we as a nation have been trained to look for 'illness care' and call it 'health care'. One way to help fix this is to include chiropractors in our choice of physician for our PCP. So much of the time, allopathic medicine (traditional MD, DO, etc. physicians) provide \"illness care\", looking for what is wrong and using drug therapy to reduce symptoms to help you feel 'healthy'. Chiropractic is considered \"health care\" and looks for what it takes to actually get your body right and let your body heal. Here are just some of the reasons to see a chiropractor as your Primary Care Physician (PCP). - Chiropractors know the musculoskeletal system, related conditions AND how to treat them. - Chiropractic education is comparable to the education of MD's and DO's. We have more education is certain areas (diagnostic imaging, musculoskeletal anatomy, and related conditions), less in others (pharmacology, drug interactions and surgery.) - Chiropractors know that we do not heal anything - we remove restrictions in your body, increasing nerve energy function, circulation, and thereby encourage end-organ function and self-healing. - We help you with nutrition advice so you know what raw materials are required so your body can heal itself. - No drugs (conservative care) Once drugs suppress symptoms (how your body reacts to stimuli), all health care providers may have a problem getting to the root cause of a condition. Your symptoms tell a story, about where your body is in health and gives us clues to help determine what your care plan should contain to help you heal. - Some chiropractors advocate the use of supplementation (not drugs) - these (natural) substances work with your body to encourage healing by giving the body the raw materials it needs. - No surgery (conservative care) When surgery is complete and recovery is over, there are many possible outcomes that may inhibit your healing - adhesions (internal scars), fusion of spinal elements (that were made to move, and now can't move.) - Typically, a lower cost for a course of care. We hear from our patients that their allopathic physician office typically has long wait times in reception, are inattentive to their conditions and questions and have short, hurried encounters (sometimes less than 5 minutes.) They get too many prescriptions (sometimes trying to correct a side-effect of previously prescribed medication), it seems there is always a referral to a specialist, and so on. So \u2014 you might consider a chiropractor as another option. Today, selecting a chiropractic physician as your PCP is not as radical as it sounds. Many insurance websites statement: \"a PCP may also be a chiropractor.\" Chiropractors are physicians, and with the exception of pharmacology and surgery, we receive the same training in science as medical doctors. Chiropractors are trained to recognize signs and symptoms of illnesses and can laboratory tests and imaging studies. If a chiropractor makes a diagnosis or obtains other results that point to a condition outside our areas of expertise or scope of practice, we will absolutely refer your care to an allopathic physician or specialist. Most chiropractors maintain a referral list of allopathic physicians and specialists. Chiropractors perform physical and other exams. So, you can see your chiropractor for any of the following in addition to your musculoskeletal complaints: - annual check-ups - sports physicals - exams required for work - exams required for driving - travel exams, (mission trips, cruises) - excuse notes for school or work - recommendations for ergonomic accommodations (how your workspace helps or hinders your health) Chiropractors perform musculoskeletal and neurologic tests too. A musculoskeletal exam is more important than you might think; as you age, many times the first systems in your body that start to decline are often the bones, joints, tendons, ligaments, and muscles. Chiropractors may notice subtle signs of neurologic conditions too, and help you understand what these signs might mean. Your first visit to healthcare may be for a back, nerve, or ligament issue, and these are what chiropractic treats. Chiropractic physicians introduced functional testing into health care. Commonly used test kits that evaluate your digestive function, measure hormones, or test for food sensitivities all got their start in chiropractic offices. Chiropractors have paved the way for plenty of testing that has been pivotal for improving health and wellbeing. Because of our training (and license limitations), chiropractors do not perform surgery or prescribe drugs, so treatment for virtually any condition \u2014 from a bad cold to a bad back, from high cholesterol to high blood pressure, from heartburn/GERD to a bladder infection \u2014 begin with lifestyle changes and non-pharmacologic nutritional supplements. The mainstay of chiropractic medicine is prevention: nutrient-dense eating, regular exercise, stress reduction, and nutritional supplements when needed. It's unfortunate that allopathic physicians may skip benign interventions and reach for the prescription pad, speed dial you a specialist, or schedule you for surgery. PCP chiropractors opt for less invasive means of addressing your symptoms. Intense medicalization of your condition may be dangerous. Many MDs sometimes too quickly offer overly aggressive treatments. In the US, 'medical error' is now the third leading cause of death and incorrectly taken prescription drugs are the fourth!
