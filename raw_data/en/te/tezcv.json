Following several years under the effects of birth control medication my body is slowly recovering to a regular moon cycle. In 2019 I decided to leave the notions of western medicine behind me and embarked a journey of self-healing, diving into various traditions from the world, to find a solution to the depression I had been experiencing. The consequences of hormonal imbalance are both mental and physical, characterised by depressive states, anxiety and fatigue, conditions being linked to the disruption of a self-regulating internal system. I understand the acceptance of menstruation as a fundamental step towards the prosperity of women and their thriving presence as part of society. Studies on holistic and traditional indigenous medicine demonstrate the value of synchronising the physical and spiritual body to the natural biorhythms of the earth and the moon, exploring the wisdom of cyclical living to regain harmony with the nurturing feminine. Through the onirical and transformative vision of a motherly essence that connects the human and the environmental under one aspect of communal existence, it is the projects' aim to reflect on a harmonious and fertile coexistence with nature and a sacred reverence to the cycles of life. It is a study of women and their place in contemporary living, in community and vibrating with sexual independency, creating space for dialogue and information. Bodhi Shola *** [Bodhi Shola](https://www.instagram.com/bodhi.shola/) is a visual artist exploring awareness on the interconnection between intimacy, nature and the sacred, addressing acceptance on the taboos of contemporary social culture. Infused by her experiences and studies on the Eastern philosophies and Southern-American plant medicine, the awareness towards a transversal and ecological development of society is at the core of the artist's creation. It is through the symbolical and dream infused language of the creative medium that Bodhi Shola integrates an eco-feminist vision that supports the reconstitution of collective ritualistic practices, female empowerment and equality as well as the preservation of environmental biodiversity and earth-based heritage. The process at the basis of Bodhi Shola's work nourishes respect and celebration of nature and communities, creating her pieces by careful and ethical material sourcing from local and fair-trade artisanal businesses.
