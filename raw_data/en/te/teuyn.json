In recent years Ayurvedic drugs have kindled interest, on account of their efficacy for curing several human ailments with little or no adverse effects if properly administered. Butstill there is lack of data on efficacy, safety and toxicity of herbal drugs. Hence there is need to find herbal drugs which are effective, fr eely available , economical , producing minimum rich source of natural antioxidants, nutr i- ents, fat, starch and protein, and reported to have antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory ,antiviral, antibacterial, cardioprotective andantimutagenic activities. AIMS AND STUDY Tostudy the acutetoxicity of seedkernel ofMangifera Indica. Linn MATERIALS AND METHODS The ofMangifera Indi- ca.Linn were collected from fruit vendour atRajajinagar Bangalore .Seeds were care- fully checked for the presence of infested ones and after removing them, washed with water to remove dust. Seed cover re- moved and seed kernel was collected and Sample was then dried under shade. Co m- pletelydriedseedkernels were then pounded to conve rt them in to fine powder and sieved and preserved in air -tight food grade plastic containers. Powder thus o b- tained was used for preliminary phyt o- ReviewArticle International Ayurvedic Medical Journal ISSN:2320 5091 ABSTRACT With the globalization of Ayurveda it is need of the time to prove the available data in texts on scientific basis through experiments. In ancient Ayurvedic literature many references are available regarding drug tes ting on animals for safety of mankind. In Charaka samhita it has been explained to test the food whether it is poisonous or not by testing on fire and by reaction of different birds and animals after consuming or merely seeing the poi sonous su b- stances. In Sushruta Samhita K alpashtana there is similar reference dealing with observatio ns animal experiments. Acharya Vagbhata in Ashtanga hasalso ex- plained the same. The Mango fruit is commonly eaten by human beings and seed is thrown out considering it as waste, but there is reference about medicinal value of amrabeejamajja1 (Mangifera indica, Linn) in Ayurveda current study is taken to evaluate its effect. As per OECD 423 guidelines acute toxicity study was conducted and this drug proved to be non- toxic. Keywords: Amrabeejamajja, Mangifera indicaAshalatha M Shivakumar toxicological stu d- ies.Healthyfemalealbino mice three in numberwere selected for the study.The standard guidelines for the housing and feeding of the animals mentioned in the OECD Guidelines were followed. Approv- alwas obtained from Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) with reference no: IAEC/ABMRCP/2014 -15/05 dated 28/06/2014. The study was carried out for a total period of 14 days following the OECD guidelines no.4233. Preparation of animals: Thealbinomice wereprocured from Acharya & BM R eddy college of pharmacy Bangalore , marked to permit individual identification, and kept in their cages for at least 5 days prior to dosing to allow for acclimatization to the laboratory conditions. The temperature in the experimental animal room 22\u00baC (+ 3\u00baC) and Lighting was artificial, t he se- quence being 12 hours light, 12 hours dark. For feeding, conventional laboratory dietwas used with an unlimited supply of drinking water. Preparation of dos ageform:Powder of SKMIdissolved in 1% w/v of carboxy m cellulose, prepared justpriorto ad- ministration. Administration of doses: The animals were made to fast overnight prior to dosing (withheld for 3 -4 hours and Ad libitum) following which they were weighed, doses calculated according to body weight .Trial drug isproved to be non toxic with 50mg, 300mg and 2000mg/kg body weight in a single dose with oral gavage. Therefore the herbal drug isin powder form andhaslow toxicity hazard ;acute toxicity is tried with 5,000 mg/kg body weight3.The animalswerewithheld fromfood for a further 1 -2 hours after administration of the doses. TEST PROCEDURE: Threemice were used andmarkedac- cordingly. Single dose of mg/kg body weight of SKMI powderwasadminis- tered toeachmice The animals were observed individua l- ly after dosing, at least once during the first30 minutes then periodically up to 24 hours, with special attention given duringthe first 4 hours. They were observed daily thereafter for a 14 days. Absence of mortality indicates the drug belonging to Category 5 (Testing of animals in category 5 (5000mg/kg) is considered when there is a low toxicity hazard and that have direct relevance for protecting human or animal health.) OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS The mice were observed for tre m- ors,convulsions, salivation, diarrhea, leth- argy,sleep, circulatory, autonomic and cen- tral nervous systems were also observed for any adverse symptoms. None of the experimental animals died during study period. Food and water consumption, n a- ture of excreta and behaviour remained unaltered throughout study period. Obse r- vations during the first 30 minutes, 24 hours and 14 days showed no changes in any of the above mentioned parameters. There were no mortalities observed. After sacrificing micestomach organ sent for histopathological evaluation and results showed no histopathological changes.

Changes pertaining to their behaviour patterns were very vital to prove non -toxic nature of test drug. Absence of any abnormal behaviour withdose5000mg/kg body weight and histopathological changes makes this powder safe for longer use with dose of 500mg/kg body weight . CONCLUSION Amrabeejamajja (SKMI)is practi- callynon-toxicdrug and its safety is thus established with the present study. SKMI powders in the dose up to 5g/kg didn't showany kind of variations in mice, so 1/10thpart of 5 gm/kg i.e. 500mg/kg body wt.canbeconveniently used for i- mentalstudy for longer REFERENCES 1.Bhavamishra, \"Bhavaprakasha Nighantu\", Chaukambha Bharathi Academy, Reprint 1999. 2.Ayurvedi c Pharmacopeia of India.
