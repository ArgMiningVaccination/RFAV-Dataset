PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 11 I. Executive Summary In March 2011, Mauritania adopted its third Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP ) action plan , covering the medium term (2011 -2015 ) . Poverty reduction as the ultimate objective of all of the country's economic social and institutional development policies has informed the context in which the third action plan is being implemented . All those concerned with poverty reduction, be it the government, elected officials, the private sector, civil society, or the development partners , have broadly supported implementation of the PRSP . The support of the international community and successive debt cancellations on the part of members of the Paris Club have also contributed to the results achieved in recent years. This status report presents the results for the year 2011 and the outlook for the period 2012 -2015. Results of the first year of PRSP III implementation The priority actions carried out during the first year of implementation of PRSP III included : (i) continuation of implementation of economic financial and policies and of reforms aimed at maintain ing macroeconomic stability and improving the competitiveness of the economy; (ii ) expansion of policies that anchor growth in the economic sphere of the poor by continuing rural development programs, adopt ing a policy aimed at bringing the country's the food security situation under control , tackling the crop and pasture land shortage s, and impleme nting programs aimed at combating poverty and improving the living standards of the population by means of the refurbishment of shantytowns; (iii ) human resources development and expansion of basic services; and (iv ) governance and capacity building. Despite an unfavorable international economic climate and the effects of the drought on the livestock sector, PRSP III implementation in 2011 had positive results in a context of sustained and stabl e growth characterized by : (i) an economic growth rate of 4 percent , explained by buoyancy in the fisheries, public works and construction, and services sectors, offset in part by the significant decline in agricultural output (20 percent year-on-year); (ii ) inflation kept to 5.7 percent (annual average ) thanks in part to a reduced rate of transmission of imported inflation affecting food and petroleum products; and (iii ) a lower current account deficit as the increase in prices for export products offset the higher petroleum and food bill throughout 2011 . A greater focus was placed on a nchoring growth policies in the economic sphere of the poor, with the main objective of directing national development strategies toward reducing poverty and inequality by creating a context favorable to an equitable redistribution of the fruits of growth : (i) implementation , through specific social policies , of Solidarity 2011 reflect ing the interest of the authorities in the living conditions of the population ; (ii) development and adoption of a national food security policy aimed at achieving a structural reduction of poverty and inequality by ensuring constant and universal access all Mauritanians to the food needed for a healthy active life; (iii ) continued impleme ntation of the urban development program in neighborhoods on the outskirts of Nouakchott and in the country's interior to tackle the high prevalence of poverty in these areas and the precarious hous ing conditions of the citizens living there; ( iv) the shar p increase in the volume of credit distributed by microfinance institutions (MFI); and (vi ) development and adoption of the national social protection strategy, which will increase access to risk management instruments and social protection systems for the most vulnerable and poorest segments of the population as well as other social groups at risk. Aware of the leverage effect of poverty reduction spending on efforts to redistribute the fruits of growth , the authorities have emphasized execution of such p riority spending, which totaled UM 107.9 billion1 in 2011. The indicative target of poverty -reducing expenditure equivalent to 10.3 percent of GDP was thus reached during the first year of implementation of the third PRSP action plan. Significant efforts were made in the areas of human resources development and the expansion of basic services. In the education sector, these efforts resulted in a significant increase in : (i) the gross enrollment ratio (GER ) at the primary school level, w hich rose from 98.8 percent in 2010 to 98.9 percent in 2011, close to the target of 100 percent set for 2015; (ii ) the number of pupils at the primary level (535,976 ) and a slight increase in the number of schools (4 ,075); (iii ) student retention rates ; and (iv ) the participation rate for girls. 1 Islamic Republic of Mauritania: Letter of Intent, Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and Technical Memorandum of Understanding; IMF, June 2012. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 12 In the health sector, geographic access to healthcare within a radius of 5 km increased to 80.08 percent . Despite the efforts made by the authorities in 2011, the most recent multiple indicators cluster survey (MICS) in 2011 revealed persistently high levels of maternal and infant and child mortality rates, at 626 per 100,000 live births and 118 per 1 ,000 live births, respectively. Nevertheless this lag could be overcome with the implementation of the Presidential Initiative aimed at accelerat ing the achievement of the MDGs for health by 2015. The safe drinking water supply rate reached 52 percent nationally. In urban areas (towns with more than 5,000 inhabitants), the rate of access to private water main connections was 35 percent although it varied significantly from town to town . In rural areas, 60 percent of households had access to safe drinking water. During the first year of implementation of the PRSP III, significant progress was made with actions targeting good governance and capacity -building in all areas of governance (political, democratic, territorial, local, environmental and economic). In this context, political and democratic governance was strengthened by the confirmed commitment of the government to anchor dialogue and consultation , in accordance with the program of the President of the Republic , as well as improve the government's relations with all segments the soci opolitical landscape and national community. This strategic choice was confirmed at the end of the year just ended with the organization of a constructive dialogue bringing together various political parties (the majority as well as some opposition parties ) for the first time to study the mechanisms needed to promote our democratic life and ensure stability for our political institutions. At the conclusion of this dialogue, human rights, national unity, justice , and the power of the judiciary were strengthened by means of : (i) a confirmed commitment on the part of the authorities to respect human rights resulting in the granting of pardons by the President of the Republic to prisoners, the decriminalization of press offenses, the decision of the government to a ssist indigents who are unable to pay damages assessed against them, the appeal by the public prosecutor's office of the death sentence against the miners; (ii ) the crucial role played by the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH ) in better anchoring democracy and human rights through advocacy to alert the authorities to human rights violations and unannounced visits to prisons throughout the national territory to investigate violations of human rights; (iii) an open discussion in the public media of slavery involving all sides and the application by the courts of the law criminalizing slavery in the context of an unprecedented mobilization by antislavery NGOs; (iv) solutions to pas t slippages that led to mas s human rights violations by, in particular, accelerati ng the process of compensating military victims and continu ing the process of organized return of 5 ,200 Mauritanian refugees in Senegal whose cases were pending; and (v ) efforts to dispense diligent, functional and effective justice in pursuit of the right to an equitable trial for those brought to justice and a significant improvement in prison conditions. In the area of territorial and local governance , significant progress was made, including, in particular by: (i) the launching of the study on the national blueprint for land use planning ; (ii) continued efforts to amalgamate local communities; and (iii ) the transfer of public services and institutions to the interior of the country in order to strengthen progress with decentralization. The measures taken by the government to strengthen economic governance included : (i) continued implementation of the policy aimed at ensuring a more productive use of resources and combating mismanagemen t through the adoption of the National Anti -Corruption Strategy by the Council of Ministers ; (ii) the introduction of a blueprin t for reforming public finances that comprises all the reforms relating to the preparation, execution, auditing and transparency of the budget; and (iii ) publication by the National Statistics Office (ONS ) of reliable statistics, which are crucial for the preparation and monitoring -evaluation of macroeconomic policies, implementation of the PRSP and the tracking of progress with its plan of action and with the MDGs. Environmental governance improved as a result of the: (i) approval of legislation and strategic documents, including the Environmental and Sustainable Development Policy Declaration and several other draft document s to create the appropriate legal framework ; and (ii ) launching of studies for updating the national climate change adjustment plan. As regards t racking of PRSP III , it is worth highlighting: (i) the coming on stream of the PRSP III tracking mechanism , validated in 2011 , that introduced a permanent dialogue among the various stakeholders . This mechanism made it possible, in particular during the mid -term assessments, (ii) to update the indicators feeding the PRSP III monitoring -evaluation information system. This system consists of : (i) a \"Household PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 13 Living Conditions Tracking\" subsystem ( 6 indicators); (ii ) a \"Projects ); and (iii ) an \"Impact Evaluation\" subsystem (24 indicators). Outlook for 2012 -2015 The government will continue to implement the PRSP action plan during the period 2012 -2015 with a view to consolidating achievements made during the first year of PRSP III implementation, while emphasizing acceleration of growth and the redistribution of the fruits of growth in order to intensify efforts to combat poverty and keep the country on its path toward achieving the Millenni um Development Goals (MDGs). This action plan will be based on five core strategies that will work together to achieve the primary objective of strong, sustainab le and poverty -reducing growth. The first core strategy relate s to accelerat ing economic growth as this is the basis for all poverty reduction, improv ing the competitiveness of the economy, and reduc ing its dependence on external factors. In this context, the emphasis will be placed on : (i) stepping up structu ral reforms; (ii ) improving the business climate; (iii ) developing infrastructure in support of growth; and (iv ) stimulating the sources of growth. The second core strategy is to anchor growth in the economic sphere of the poor by enhancing the ir potential for growth and productivity. This involves promoting sectors that directly benefit the poor and the areas in which they live by means of a redistribution of the fruits of growth. To this end, the following areas will be targeted : (i) promotion of economic activities in rural areas , in particular, agriculture and livestock farming ; (ii) achievement of food security in the context of a coherent national policy covering all dimensions of the problem and fostering national production ; (iii) urban deve lopment; (iv ) promotion of access to appropriate financial services for the poor and promotion of micro and small enterprises (MSE); (v) promotion of the environment as an economic good that could contribute to poverty reduction; and (vi) social protection that will benefit the most disadvantaged segments of the population. The third core strategy focus es on human resource development by improv ing access to essential infrastructure. Th e actions provided for in this area will, over the long term, have the grea test impact on poverty through their effect on productivity and improvements in the living conditions of the poor. In this context, efforts will target : (i) promotion of the education and training system ; (ii) development of th e health system and health care services an d the improvement of nutritional conditions ; (iii) promotion of employment; (iv ) improvement of access to safe drinking water in rural areas; (v ) promotion of gender equity, protection of children, and definition and implementation of the population policy; (vi ) promotion of culture, youth and sports; and (vii ) improvement of universal access to basic services . The fourth core strategy emphasizes the promoti on of institutional development supported by good governance and the full participation of all stakeholders in the fight against poverty. With a view to building on what has already been achieved, the planned actions will focus on the following areas : (i) improvement of political and democratic governance; (ii ) improvement of justice and the power of the judiciary; (iii) consolidation of local and territorial govern ance ; (iv) strengthening of economic governance; (v) strengthening of environmental governanc e; (vi ) consolidation of citizen control over public actions; (vii) development of the communication s sector; (viii ) capacity -building for public partners ; and (ix) promotion of a participatory approach. The fifth and final core strategy reflects the special attention granted to efficient and effective implementation of the PRSP. Emphasis will be placed on strengthening oversight , monitoring , evaluation and coordination. To this end, efforts will focus in particular on : (i) establishing a n optimal institutional mechanism; (ii ) strengthening coordination, alignment and harmonization; and (iii ) implement ing the system for PRSP III monitoring -evaluation . Cost and financing of the 201 2-2015 action plan The overall cost of the PRS P action plan for the period 2012 -2015 is estimated at U M 2,091,360 million, or USD 162 million. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 14 II. Introduction In March 2011, the government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania prepared and validated its third action plan for the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP ) covering the period 2011 -2015. This action plan forms part of the global objectives of poverty reduction and improvement of people's living conditions. This plan, which takes into account the strategic approaches of the previous plan, focuses on the following core strategies : (i) acceleration of growth and stabilization of the macroeconomic framework; (ii ) anchoring of growth in the economic sphere of the poor; (iii ) development of hum an resources and expansion of basic services; (iv ) improvement of govern ance and capacity -building; and (v ) monitoring -evaluation. The third PRSP action plan, on which work began in early 2010, was prepared during implementation of the electoral program of the President of the Republic elected in 2009 and the establishment of democratic institutions , of which the overarching objective is to rise to the challenges and successfully introduce the necessary changes to put the country on a p ath toward development and better living conditions for the people , particularly th ose most disadvantaged. The new authorities were elected on the basis of an ambitious program focusing on: (i) significantly changing and raising the profile of the government by ending the decline of its authority, the loss of control of institutions, and the weak capacity of the civil service; (ii ) implement ing structural reforms, policies , and sectoral strategies that focused on accelerating growth, intensifying poverty reduction, achieving food security, and protecting the environment; and (iii ) ensuring respect for fundamental human rights by adopti ng and implement ing appropriate strategies and policies. For effective implementation , this program informed the preparation of the third PRSP action plan . The government also prepared an overall medium -term expenditure framework (MTEF) for the period 2012 - 2014 to ensure the consistency and alignment of the third poverty reduction strategy paper with th e budget laws. In an effort to ensure appropriate implementation of this third PRSP action plan, the government put particular emphasis on implementation of the monitoring -evaluation mechanism, as this aspect was considered to be fairly ineffective for the first two plans (2001 -2004 and 2006 -2010). The mechanisms for PRSP implementation monitoring thus call for the preparation of an annual report indicating progress and the main lessons to be drawn from implementation of the plan , along with an overview of the actions to be taken for the remaining period. The body of report below assesses progress during the first year of implementation of the third PRSP action plan, reviews the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and risks for implementation of the PRSP III priority actions, and present s the outlook for the period 2012 -2015. Finally, the report includes the following annexes : (i) the implementation monitoring matrix for the priority measures; (ii ) the priority action plan for 2012 -2015; (iii ) the set of PRSP monitoring indicators; and (iv ) the medi um-term macroeconomic framework. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 15 III. Summary report on one year of PRSP III implementation III.1 Growth and the macroeconomic framework PRSP III emphasizes stabilization of the macroeconomic situation and the need for strong and inclusive growth that has the capacity to reduce poverty. A. A stable and sound macroeconomic framework In the medi um term, the government's basic objective was to create conditions that would reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of the population. In the period 2011 -2015 , the authorities therefore pursued macroeconomics policies and structural reforms that would make it possible t o: (i) achieve an average annual GDP growth rate of 6.9 percent ; (ii) keep inflation close to 6 percent per year ; (iii) bring the budget deficit, including grants, to 0.8 percent of non -oil GDP on average during the period; and (iv) increase the foreign exchange reserves to the equivalent of 6.3 months of imports by 2015. The contribution of the secondary sector to overall growth will be key in the medi um term given the expansion proposals put forward by the National Mining Industries Corporation (SNIM ) and the Tasiast gold mine. This contribution is estimated at 3.3 percent on average during the period 2012 -2015. The tertiary sector, which is considered an essential leverage of economic activity, should also contribute to growth in the amount of 2.1 percent during this period, as against 2.3 percent in 2011 (and 1.8 percent during the first year of PRSP III implementation ). The rural sector should make a n estimated contribution of: (i) 0.8 percent during the period 2012 -2015; and (ii ) -0.8 percent in 2011. Overall, it should be noted that the improvement in the economic environment observed in 2010 continued in 2011. However, 2011 was particularly affected by a significant precipitation deficit that undercut the initial forecasts for the 2011/2012 agricultural harvest and a slowdown in activity in the mining industries. Recent overall GDP trends In 2011, the Mauritanian economy continued to record satisfactory results despite an unfavorable international economic context and a significant precipitation deficit. Real GDP growth is expected to slow to 4 percent (4.1 percent non-oil), as against 5.2 percent (5.7 percent non-oil) in 2010. In nominal terms, GDP increased by close to 17 percent to UM 1,184 billion. The year 2011 was characterized by a decline in the primary sector from the previous year. 2011 estimates were for a decline in growth in t he primary sector of 2.6 percent , with a resulting negative contribution by the sector to overall growth of -0.5 point. This resulted essentially from the precipitation deficit that undercut the growth objectives in the agriculture and livestock subsectors , although the strong performance of the fisheries subsector offset the decline that would have occurred in the primary sector in 2011. In the agriculture subsector , the production target initially set for the 2011/2012 rain fed harvest was 130,000 metric tons of traditional grains from 260,000 ha. For irrigated cultivation the target was 135,000 metric tons of paddy rice from 30,000 ha , for an average est imated yield of approximately 5 metric tons per hectare. On the basis of this target, the real value a dded of agricultural sector was expected to increase by almost 7 percent from levels in 2010, which had itself been a year of exceptional agricultural output. However, owing to the significant precipitation deficit during this crop year, the target s initially set were not achieved despite efforts by the authorities to support the sector , and traditional grain production declined by more than half ( -66.2 percent ) in comparison to the previous harvest, when output had reached 139,916 6.9% 5.6% croissance PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 16 metric tons . This decline was offset, however, by the winter rice sector . Land dedicated to rice cultivation increased to 20,356 ha, as compared to 19,926 ha in the previous crop year , and , with an estimated yield of 5 metric tons per hectare, rice production was expected t o total 102,187 metric tons , up 2.5 percent from the winter harvest in the previous year. As a result, value added in the agriculture subsec tor declined in real terms by 21 percent , as against an initial estimate of an increase of close to 7 percent . In the livestock subsector , the precipitation deficit had a negative impact on pasture lands, resulting in losses , particularly of cattle , with an estimated loss rate of 9 percent . However, the impact of pasture conditions on livestock will not be evident until the lean season in 2012. The subsector experienced a slight decline ( -0.4 percent ) in real growth in 2011. In the fisheries subsector , catches measured an estimated 1,101,805 metric tons in 2011, as against 1,047,201 metric tons in the previous year, an increase of almost 5.2 percent , attributable primarily to the upturn in industrial fishing . This performance resulted from measures implemented to strengthen surveillance at sea and the re quirement for foreign fishing boats to unload so that their catches can be estimate d more accurately . Valuing this output at the unit prices for the various species exported yields a nominal value added of 27 percent and a real value added of close to 13 percent . Despite the slowdown observed in the mining sector in comparison with initial forecasts, the secondary sector expanded by close to 4 percent . This was the result essentially of the performance of the construction and public works (14.5 percent ) and manufacturing (5.8 percent ) subsectors . However, the contribution of the sector to overall growth declined in 2011 to 0.9 percent as against 1.2 percent in 2010 owing to the slight downturn in the mining sector . In nominal terms, value added of the secondary sector rose by 32.1 percent , driven essentially by the r ise in export sector prices on the international markets. Iron ore production declined slightly ( -3.1 percent ) in 2011 to 11, 176 million metric tons , as against 11 ,534 million metric tons in 2010 . This resulted from delays in the production of crushed ore and the minimal yield of the Guelb I field. As a result, value added in the subsector declined by 2.8 percent in 2011. In nominal terms, however, value added for the subsector increased by 38.4 percent owing to the increase in iron prices on the international markets. In the non-ferrous metals subsector, output by MCM in 2011 brought copper production to 39,079 metric tons as against 33,554 metric tons in 2010, or increase of 16.46 percent . Meanwhile, gold production by MCM declined by 3 percent in 2011 to 78,802 ounces as against 80,989 ounces in 2010 , while TML produced 216,018 ounces of gold in 2011 as against 204,906 ounces in 2010, an increase of 5 .4 percent . Overall, value added by the metal mining industries (iron, copper and gold ) declined by close to 2 percent in real terms and increased by almost 38 percent in nominal terms, mainly because of rising metal prices. In the oil sector , the downward trend begun in 2007 continued. In 2011, annual output stood at 2,650 million barrels as against 3,025 million barrels in 2010, a decline of more than 12 percent . This situation is attributable to the recurring technical problems in the sector. Exp orted quan tities also trended downward (-45.3 percent ), declining from 3.7 million barrels to 2 million barrels between 2010 and 2011. As a result, despite a rise in the price per barrel (+36 percent ), the value of exp orts decline d by almost 26 percent . With production -related costs held in check in 2011, a nominal value added of UM 54.3 billion was achieved , as against UM 44.2 billion in 2010, or an increase of 22.1 percent . On the contrary, value added in real terms in the same period was UM 4.1 billion , as against UM 4.3 billion in 2010, or a decline of 5.6 percent . 2% 0.8% 2.2% 0.9% 2011 -2015 pr\u00e9visionnel r\u00e9vis\u00e9 objectif pr\u00e9visionnel initial PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 17 In manufacturing , the estimated real value added is based on changes in the non-oil and non-mining Industrial Production Index (IPI), which increased by 5 percent in 2011 from the previous year. This performance resulted from a net improvement in electricity supply capacity of the Mauritanian Electricity Company (SOMELEC ) and an increase in water production by the National Water Company ( SNDE ). In fact, the water and electricity index increased by close to 7 percent in 2011, while that of industrial units (excluding SOMELEC and SNDE ) increased by only 5.1 percent . In nominal terms, the value added of manufacturing increased by almost 12 percent . In the construction and public works subsector , the upturn observed since 2010 continued in 2011, with a 14.5 percent increase in real value added by the sector as a result of the completion of key infrastructure projects during the year. In nominal terms, value added increased by 21 percent . Real value added of the private services sector , made up of the transportation/communications, commerce , restaurant, hotel and other private services subsectors , increased by 8 percent in 2011 , while nominal value added rose 13.5 percent . This sector is the main support for the economy owing to its contribution to growth , i.e., 2.7 percent of growth in 2011 as against 1.6 percent in 2010, or an increase of 0.1 percent over the estimated target and achievement of the proposed target for the 2011 -2015 period . Inflation Despite high global prices for foodstuffs and energy projects in 2011, total inflation was kept to 5.7 percent (year -on-year), or 1 percent age point below forecasts. This was related in part to the slowdown in the rise in prices for food products and energy in the final months of 2011. The harmonized consumer price index (IHPC ) increased by 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter, a slight decline from the 2.2 percent observed in the third quarter. Inflation control and the general stabilization of prices result both from : (i) implementation of an emergency program by the authorities that offset the impact of the rise in international prices for food products and the consequences of the drought on local production of certain foodstuffs. and (ii ) application of a prudent monetary policy by the authorities in 2011. In the context of this prudent monetary policy , guided by inflation reduction objectives , the money supply, which is estimated at close to UM 374 billion, increased by almost 20 percent over 2010. This was explained essentially by: (i) a significant accumulation of net external assets, which stood at c lose to UM 70.8 billion in 2011, as against only UM 9.4 billion in 2010, mainly because of the foreign exchange generated by the export sectors; and (ii) an increase in credit to the economy to approximately UM 312.9 billion, or 10.1 percent over 2010, as a result of bank lending in the main economic sectors. External Sector Despite an increase in imports of goods of almost 29 percent in 2011, driven by the strong performance of oil products and mining activities, the balance of payments current account deficit improved significantly, to the equivalent of 7.4 percent of GDP, as against 8.6 percent of GDP in 2010. This is due essentially from the 35 percent increase in exports resulting primarily from strong export values in the petroleum and mining industries. 5.8% 5% PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 18 As a result, gross foreign exchange reserves, which totaled approximately USD $287.8 million in 2010 stood a t an estimated level of USD 502 million in 2011, or the equivalent of 2.5 and 3.6 months of imports, respectively . The external public debt declined from 83.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 76.8 percent of GDP in 2011, reflecting debt reduction by the government and its commitment to contract loans on concessional terms . Fiscal policy basis The government continued to make progress with budget management in 2011 , resulting in a non -oil basic deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP, as against 2.4 percent in 2010, despite the strong upward pressure on public expenditures related to implementation of the emergency program. The significant effort to collect taxes and the rise in mining revenues help ed offset the cost of the emergency program introduced in 2011 to mitigate the impact of the rise in commodity prices on the most vulnerable segments of the population. With the declin ing need for financing and a liquidity surplus in the banking sector, treasury bill rates fell to record lows, just under 3 percent . Government expenditures totaled UM 341.3 8 billion in 2011, as against UM 282.95 billion in 2010 , while revenues excluding grants and oil increased to over UM 294 billion in 2011, owing to tax collections (+27 percent ), for an overall increase of 23 percent in comparison with 2010.

C. Development of infrastructure in support of growth Over the course of 2011, the government ma intained its strong commitment to allocating the necessary resources for sound infrastructure development to shorten distances and ease the quasi -monopolies created by obstacles to the smooth flow of goods, to facilitate the supply of quality and competitive services, and reduce production costs as well as develop economic activit y and support growth. Development of the land transport, port and airport sector Progress in the land transport sector in 2011 involved the legal and institutional framework for the sector, studies, and the modernization and development of land transport infrastructure.

In the livestock sector, the following were the main actions taken : (i) extension of the capacities of veterinar y services by equipping the bacteriology lab ; providing training on rabies (diagnosis , surveillance and control); improv ing equipment and supplies and border control offices; training 60 field agents in the principal pathologies ; and equip ping 32 surveillance posts with veterinary supplies and cold storage; (ii) drafting and finalization of the decree on the domestic animal health police , and organization of a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE ) support mission to update the legislation; (iii ) installation of fourteen Rift Valley fever surveillance sites; (iv ) startup of activities on the Idini genetic enhancement experimental farm with the insemination of 50 cows; (v ) construction of 20 animal inoculation centers ; and (vi ) launching of a call for bids for the construction of a dairy in N\u00e9ma . PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 23 III.2 PRSP priority areas A. Education and training The strong correlation between the success of program s to accelerate redistributive growth that is strongly anchored in the economic sphere of the poor, development of human resources , and wider access to basic services for the poor have led the government to accord these areas particular importance in the PRSP The third PRSP action plan, covering the period 2011 -2015 , therefore defined priority areas with a high potential for reducing poverty and disparities . The objective assigned to the education sector in PRSP III was to produce human capital capable of promoting the country's economic and social development . This objective was to be achieved through the implementation of a strategy that focused on : (i) improv ing the supply of education by reorganizing public and private education to make it better adapted to demand and thus to improve retention rates at the primary school level and promote equity at the secondary school level; (ii ) improv ing teaching quality; (iii) improv ing internal and external effectiveness in order to provide qualified labor to increase the productivity of the traditional sector, promote its development, and ensure a highly qualified labor supply to meet the needs of a modern sector in the coming decades; and (iv ) improv ing and enhancing the management and oversight of the system . Under PRSP III , efforts to construct or rehabilitate school and training infrastructure and to recruit and train teaching staff were ongoing . During this period, the focus was to build on what had been achieved thus far and to correct dysfunctions at the various education levels . At the primary (basic education ) level, the number of pupils has increased significantly , from 465,887 in 2005/2006 t o 535,976 in 2010/2011, an increase of 13 percent over the period. The number of schools increased from 2,980 t o 4,075 during the same period , and t he share of private education rose from 7 percent in 2006 to 11 percent in 2011. The gross enrollment ratio (GER ) at the primary level, which was 98.8 percent in 2010, rose to 98.9 percent in 2011, close to the target of 100 percent set for 2015. Boy/girl parity slightly favored girls (50.4 percent ), but th e retention rate remains low as only about 65.2 percent of pupils finish primary school. The probability of completing primary school is higher for boys (42 percent ) than it is for girls (34 percent ). The GER target was achieved in 2010 in all the wilayas, with the exception of Gorgol (90.09 percent ) and Hodh Charghi (86.8 percent ). At the lower secondary level, the GER improved slightly from 26.6 percent in 2006 to 29.6 percent in 2011. This improvement follows on the increased enrollment at the primary level, despite the low level of passage from primary to secondary school : 50.2 percent in 2011, as against 56 percent in 2006 . Student populations declined by 20.7 percent at the upper secondary level during the same period, with a GER of 13.6 percent for boys and 17 percent for girls. This decline results from the structural change imposed by the reform, which lengthened the lower second ary school level. Declining quality was also observed, as shown by the poor results in the lower secondary school and final secondary school exams . In higher education , considerable efforts have been made to diversify, broaden, and professionalize offerin gs. New areas of study have been created in the various higher education institutions along with the introduction of a large number of masters programs. The new university campus, on which building works are at an advanced stage, will certainly contribute to improving the output and efficiency of the system. Nevertheless, some internal effectiveness issues persist at the higher education level. In traditional education , achievements in 2011 included : (i) introduction of a guide for the country's mahadras and mosques; (ii ) completion of an assessment of traditional education and religious and cultural outreach ; and (iii ) completion of several awareness -raising campaigns. The PRSP III objectives for vocational and technical training were to: (i) introduce major reforms at the institutional level to standardize oversight ; (ii) improve system governance; and (iii ) energize government - employer organizations (the National Council on Technical and Vocational Training) . In this area, achievements invol ved: (i) greater admission s capacity in training institutions; (ii ) upgrading of equipment in various training streams; (iii ) training of dozens of trainers and supervisors; (iv ) introduction of PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 24 the Technical and Vocational Training Support Project (PA-FTP); (v ) identification of the need for skills training in various sectors (services, fisheries, agriculture, industry and mining); and (vi ) creation of 6 agreements on skills training for some 5,100 young people during the period 2012 -2016, including 1,200 in 2012. The PRSP III objectives i n the area of literacy were to : (i) enable the entire population aged 14 and older to read and do arithmetic; (ii ) improve retention rates at the primary school level; (iii ) build on initial literacy by providing post-literacy training and vocational training that focuses on income -generating activities (IGA); and (iv ) promoting a desire for self -learning. While literacy has improved significantly, upstream efforts (primary education ) and downstream efforts (illiterate workers ) are still needed to combat the lack of education that continues to affect a substantial portion of the working population . B. Health and nutrition PRSP III set the following priority objectives f or the health and nutrition sector : (i) improve oversight , good governance and performance of the sector; (ii ) improve universal access to high -quality health care services; (iii ) strengthen the integrated management of disease; and (iv ) develop health financing mechanisms . A recent analysis of Mauritania's health conditions showed that the three main challenges for the health care system are related to the health problems of the population, the problems of the health system, and external factors affecting the sector . The health problems of the population reflect the country's epidemiological profile, which is dominated by the following pathologies : (i) communicable diseases, particularly malaria, tuberculosis, STI/HIV/AIDS, intestinal and urinary parasites, broncho -pulmonary infections, eye infections, and infectious dermatitis in children (these pathologies are largely dominated by diarrhea, acute respiratory infections and malaria ); and (ii) non-communicable diseases related to environmental factors and/or changes in the behavior of individuals and communities . The latter group of diseases is dominated by cardio -vascular diseases, cancers, mental illness, diabetes, the health effects of tobacco and psychoactive substance s, and an upsurge in occupational diseases and broncho -pulmonary diseases related to air pollution ; (iii) nutritional imbalances, particularly among mothers and children, with a preponderance of protein -calorie malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies (iron, vitamin A, iodine ) and obesity; and (iv) perinatal patholog y with its consequences for the health of the mother and child . These diseases are aggravated by external factors such as poverty and the environment. The problems in the health care system are related primarily to : (i) insufficient health care coverage, with 21 percent of the population living more than 5 km from a n operati onal health care unit ; and (ii ) shortage of health workers (nurses, midwives, doctors, etc. ) at all levels and the poor quality of those workers . The health system is also adversely affected by a multitude of external factors, specifically factors relating to hygiene (safe drinking water and the removal of household waste); problems relating to human behavior; macroeconomic problems affecting financing and appropriations for the sect or, and problems relating to food and nutritional security and natural disasters. The most recent multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS ) in 2011 showed persistent high levels of maternal and infant and child mortality rates, at 626 per 100,000 live births and 118 per 1,000 live births, respectively . In 2011, a number of actions were taken : (i) preparation of the 2012 -2020 national health development plan, along with a medium -term expenditure framework (MTEF ) for its first phase, i.e., 2012 -2015; (ii) development of a strategic framework for combating HIV/AIDS; (iii ) development of a national anti - malaria framework; and (iv ) extension of the forfait obst\u00e9trical (a health savings system in which members save for the anticipated costs of obstetric care ), among measures to reduce the maternal mortality ratio. Looking at health care coverage, 80.08 percent of the population has access to a health care unit within 5 km, although this access is distributed unequally across the country. In response to th is situation, significant actions have been taken to substantially reduce the portion of the population that does not have easy access to a health care unit : (i) rehabilitation of health care centers in Sebkha, Teyarett and El Mina; (ii) construction of four health centers (Tarhil Nouakchott, Tarhil Nouadhibou, Hay Sakin and Termessa); (iii ) expansion of the Mother and Child Hospital Center and the National Oncology Center (CNO ); and (iv) equipment of 15 health care centers and 15 health clinics . As well construction has started PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 25 on 10 health clinics , on hospitals in Rosso and Ka\u00e9di, and on the Emergency Medical Care Service (SAMU ), and the construction and equipment of the National Cardiology Center ( CNC ) has also begun . Nevertheless, efforts to combat disease are hampered by the lack of an effective strategy for developing high-quality services that can rapidly alleviate the suffering of the ill, particularly children and pregnant women, who have become disaffected vis -\u00e0-vis health care struct ures (0.6 contact per person per year). However, significant efforts have been made to remedy this situation : (i) purchase and distribution of more than 40,000 insecticide -treated mosquito nets for households living in regions where malaria is endemic; (ii) organization of more than five vaccination campaigns to control and eradicate polio nationally; (iii) organization of a campaign in response to the measles epidemic targeting persons aged 5 to 29 in three wilayas (the two Hodhs and Assaba); (iv ) organization of a national campaign for tracking measles targeting children under five throughout the country; and (v ) availability of antiretrovirals (ARV ) for persons living with HIV/AIDS. To improve the availability of qualified health care staff, the following actions were taken : (i) recruitment of 296 health care staff; (ii ) ongoing training of 20 public health officials; (iii ) creation of 3 nursing schools (in N\u00e9ma, S\u00e9libaby and Rosso); (iv ) training of 25 health care instructors; (v ) support for the training of 43 specialist s and coverage of the expense of training two radiation therapists and (v ) training of 60 nurses. To improve the performance of the sector, the measures taken related primarily to : (i) health care public expenditure reviews; and (ii) preparation of the national health sector accounts. At the institutional level in 2011 , Decree 90 -2011 of June 9, 2011 created a Public Health Directorate, with the primary task of developing and implementing the health and hygiene policy, promoting health and hygiene regulations, and monitoring application of such regulations, particularly Law 42 -2010 of July 21, 2010 on the Hygiene Code and its various implementing regulations . C. Water and sanitation The PRSP III action plan set an overall objective for the water and sanitation sector of \"improving universal access to water and sanitation of sufficient quality and quantity on a sustainable and affordable basis.\" This objective was to be achieved through the imple mentation of the following key strategies : (i) improve ment of access to safe drinking water; (ii ) identif ication and protect ion of water resources; (iii) improve ment of sanitation conditions; (iv ) promot ion of the public -private partnership; and (v ) capacity - building in the sector. The rate of access to safe drinking water was 52 percent nationally in 2010. In urban areas (towns with more than 5,000 inhabitants), the rate of access to private water main connections was 35 percent and varied significantly from town to town : (i) coverage of the National Water Company (SNDE ) was expanded to 23 eligible centers; (ii ) in Nouakchott, almost 30 percent of households have access to private water main connections; other cities in the area covered by SNDE record higher levels, with 46 percent of households having private water main connections; and (iv ) in areas managed by the National Office for Water Supply Services in Rural Areas (ONSER), 50 percent of households have private water main connections . In rural areas in 2010, 60 percent of households had access to safe drinking water , while almost a third of towns with more than 500 inhabitants still needed to be equipped with a water distribution network . In 2011, water production and distribution infrastructure projects and programs had a significant impact on improving access to water and sanitation services . These projects included : (i) the water supply project for more than 200 communities with over 500 inhabitants in rural areas; (ii ) the river -sourced safe w ater distribution system (AEP ) (20 water treatment plants); (iii ) the start -up of the water supply project for Aftout Charghi from Fo um Legleitta to meet the needs of over 500 communities; (iv ) the water program of the Agency for the Promotion of Universal Access to Services (APAUS ) (18 AEP networks and 47 wells); (v) installation of 3 river water treatment plants under the National Refugee Integration Support Agency (ANAIR ) water program; (vi ) estab the two Hodhs and Assaba; and (vii ) startup of works for the water distribution network project in Nouakchott. The following actions were taken to replace equipment and upgrade networks : (i) replacement of 188 generators, 206 submerged pumps, 37 pumps and 18 solar panels; (ii ) rehabilitation and expansion of 130 PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 26 networks; (iii ) upgrading of the AEP distribution network in Nouadhibou; and (iv ) implementation of an AEP enhancement program for SNDE centers in the interior. The id entification and protection of water resources is extremely important in a country with a shortage of water, as is the case in Mauritania. The following measures were taken in this area : (i) development of a water resource information system in the wilayas of Brakna and Trarza; (ii ) construction and/or rehabilitation of the premises of the Regional Water Services (SRH ) in Brakna and Trarza; (iii ) increased human and material resources for the SRHs; (iv ) completion of hydrogeological studies to inventory wat er resources in the wilayas of Trarza and Brakna; and (v ) delineation of areas for the strategic protection and safeguard ing of resources serving large cities and secondary towns area of sanitation , blueprints were prepared for the cities of Nouadhibou, Rosso, Kiffa, Ka\u00e9di and Akjoujt. As well, a national sanitation strategy and policy paper were finalized. This strategy organizes sanitation and hygiene promotion actions in Mauritania by structuring the waste and rainwater sanitation and hygiene sector around a development project covering the period 2012 -2020. For sanitation in rural areas, the total commune -run sanitation (ATPC ) approach was extended as a gateway to beh avioral change (700 villages have been supplied with latrines). This approach is being used in 5 wilayas around the country ( Trarza, Brakna, Tagant, Assaba and Adrar). The main objective of PRSP III in promoting public -private partnerships was to establish the conditions that would genuinely allow the private sector to take over the water subsector. In this context, the following actions were taken : (i) application of co ncession ing procedures to public water services; and (ii) introduction of standardized pricing for water. D. Rural development Activities in the rural development program included in PRSP III through 2015 focus on five major objectives : (i) promoting growth in the sector to ensure the country's food security; (ii ) provid ing equitable access to resources; (iii ) increas ing the supply and availability of goods and services that are essential to the sustainable development of the sector; (iv ) improv ing the capacity to manage integrated and participatory rural development; and (v ) enhanc ing the mechanism for monitoring serious diseases (Rift Valley fever, avian flu, etc.). In this area, the following actions were taken : (i) acceptance of rehabilitation work in the Bolol Dogo (43.6 ha) and Neja (141 ha ) areas in Brakna, and the Bambi Diaguily area (160 ha ) in Guidimakha; (ii ) continued development of 130 ha in the Dreimiss area of Gorgol; (iii ) start-up of rehabilitation work in the Rindiaw and B\u00e9linab\u00e9 areas covering a total of 158.5 ha; (iv ) start-up of the upgrading of community lands in Babab\u00e9 and B\u00e9thi\u00e9 B\u00e9thi\u00e9; (v ) development of important waterways in Trarza, ensuring a water supply for more than 6,000 ha; (vi ) completion of a program of 31 dams in the interior of the country; (vii ) equipment of 60 wells with individual solar pumps to irrigate palm trees (irrigation kits); (viii ) rehabilitation of the National Agricultural Training and Extension School (ENFVA ) in Ka\u00e9di; (ix ) development of 900 new ha in M'Pouri\u00e9 for unemployed graduates and the rehabilitation of 624 additional ha; (x ) launching of a call for bids for the development 2,400 ha in Brakna and Trarza for the Baylane; (xi ) completion of a study for a second expansion of 1,200 ha for the installation of a new unemployed graduating class; and (xii ) construction of important infrastructure linking agricultural areas and thus allowing for the transportation of agricultural output from oas es and valleys . The following institutional actions were taken : (i) establishment of a fund for the purchase of cattle vaccines and feed; (ii ) improvement of the surveillance and early warning system for combating desert locusts; (iii) surveillance and rapid intervention along with the definition and building of capacit ies in the National Anti-Locust Center (CNLA ) and the Project Coordination Unit of the Africa Emergency Locust Project (AELP -PCU); (iv ) launching of a study of the development plan for Tam ourett Naaj; (v ) assessment of the productivity of varieties and identification of a program for the development and improvement of food crop species; (vi ) implementation of an information -education -communication (IEC ) training program; (vii) creation of a gene bank and village seed stores; and (viii ) reactivation of the National Plant and Seed Council. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 27 E. Food security In recent decades, despite significant progress in the management and prevention of food crises, Mauritania has faced a situation of food insecurity owing to a number of factors , both economic and structural . Approximately 26 percent of the population is directly or indirectly affected by food insecurity. This situation is aggravated by national poverty and insufficient investment in the social and productive sectors. In response, the government has recently approved a national food s ecurity strategy underpinned by an action plan and specific programs aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the poor to exogenous and endogenous shocks and the management of emergencies and crises. As part of this strategy, there are plans to improve inte rvention in all sectors and subsectors directly or indirectly concerned by this objective in order to : (i) promote long -term solutions to the development of food security and strengthen the early warning system; and (ii ) improve the capacities of the parties concerned . To consolidate crisis prevention and food security program design capacities, the following key measures were taken in 2011 in the area of crisis prevention and management : (i) a survey of structural vulnerabilities at the communal leve l; (ii) a survey to identify vulnerable families in Nouakchott that contributed to a significant improvement in the targeting of recipients of food aid; and (iii ) two surveys to assess the food security of households . To enhance operational capacities and the ability to implement Food Security Commission (CSA ) programs, the following actions were taken : (i) rehabilitation of storage areas with a capacity of 12,600 metric tons ; and (ii ) increase in the national security stock . Key emergency assistance measures taken in 2011 with the objective of assisting vulnerable segments of the population and implementing programs to combat malnutrition included : (i) the opening of 688 nutritional feeding centers; (ii ) implementation of the extended emergency assis tance program in food insecurity zones; (iii ) provision of emergency assistance in the Nouakchott urban area, focusing on indigents in the three Nouakchott moughataas (Riad, El Mina and Arafat ) and in Ka\u00e9di; (iv ) establishment of a special solidarity progr am to counteract the effects of sudden price rises ; and (v ) emergency assistance on several occasions for the victims of floods in various parts of the country . In order to achieve the objective of reducing the vulnerability of the population to exogenous shocks, the following steps were taken in the area of \"development microprojects\" : (i) implementation of a program of \"Food for Work\" micro -projects; (ii ) restoration of the village food security stocks (SAVS); and (iii) implementation of a vast program t o enclose rain fed cultivation areas . F. Urban development In the area of urban development , the government took significant measures to improve living conditions in 2011, particularly in the housing, urban development and construction subsectors, and also in the area of water and sanitation. In the area of housing , the authorities focused on providing services to and marketing subsidized lots to provide disadvantaged segments of the population with land and thus support their establishment in urban areas. The preparation of a database o f civil servants and completion of a housing survey reinforced the commitment to launch a pilot housing program for civil servants. These housing programs are intended to provide them with inexpensive housing and to make up the enormous lags recorded in this area . In the area of urban development and construction , the authorities have focused on continuing and stepping up programs for the re -habilitation of shantytowns in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou , as well as in Zou\u00e9rate, Ka\u00e9di and Rosso. Actions taken have made it possible to integrate vast urban areas by providing them with basic infrastructure and services. The rebuilding of the damage d city of Tintane was followed by a program to provide services and to di stribute housing or commercial lots to the public. Other achievements including the rehabilitation of public buildings and equipment; 145 public buildings and equipment were built across the country (including, notably , the administrative buildings in the wilayas of Traza and Dahklet NDB that were refurbished with an extension in Nouadhibou) . A major infrastructure program was also implemented as part of the Urban Development Program to improve roads, water distribution, electricity and storm sewers in nine Status Report Year 2011 28 In the specific subsectors of water and sanitation in urban areas , significant progress was made in 2011, particularly in the distribution of safe drinking water in urban areas. The project to modernize the water distribution network in Nouakchott was begun, and the program to improve the water distribution systems of SNDE centers in the safe drinking water distribution project in Maghtaa Lahjar and communities on the Chegar -Guimi -Maghtaa Lahjar Road from the Bouhchicha wellfield made significant progress, with the construction of a pumping and storage station. As a result, access to safe drink ing water rose to 52 percent nationally. In urban areas, the a rate of access to private water main connections stood at 35 percent , although levels fluctuated widely from city to city. In the area of sanitation , the government's efforts in 2011 result ed in the expansion of the collective sanitation network in Nouakchott by means of the rehabilitation of the Mauritanian Property Management and Construction Company ( SOCOGIM ) TZ and V block networks and their connection to the existing network. A significant effort by the National Sanitation Office (ONAS ) was made to replace pumping equipment and maintain the existing sanitation network in Nouakchott . Sanitation blueprints were prepared for the cities of Nouakchott, Nouadhibou, Rosso, Kiffa, Ka\u00e9di, and Akjoujt, with particular attention to the cities of Rosso and Zou\u00e9rate : a sanitation project aimed at equipping and constructi ng a wastewater and storm sewage system was carried out in Rosso and a treatment plant for wastewater from the SNIM areas was constructed in Zou\u00e9rate . Progress was also made in the area of institution al reform : a national housing promotion and development strategy was prepared and a national sanitation strategy and pol icy paper were completed. Creation of the Iskan Corporation ended the confusion that reigned between public participa nts in the area of building promotion and land development. Formalization by Iskan of partnership s with international groups augurs well for the ambitious housing projects. G. Economic development of the natural capital Actions to promot e the country's natural capital in the 2011 -2015 PRSP were primarily mainly to : (i) enable the poor to meet the ir basic needs from their natural environment; (ii ) reduc e the economic costs of environmental degradation; and (iii ) develop sustainable financing mechanisms for the environment in line with the principles set out in the national sustainable development str ategy. To restore the ecological balance of the tree and plant vegetation cover and protect wood and other plant resources, the following measures were taken : (i) two important microprojects were implemented in ) oueds plans for their development; (ii) reduction in the demand for wood fuel by effectively implementing the domestic ene rgy strategy and developing alternative sources of energy , such as the multifunctional platforms introduced in cooperation with the Agency for the Promotion of Universal Access to Services (APAUS ) in two pilot wilayas; (iii) implementation of the national reforestation and dune stabilization campaign, which has created direct jobs; (iv ) adoption of various laws and regulations on natural resource management, including the law establishing the special status of water, forest and hunting officials; (v ) reduct ion in the number of brush fires by 11 percent ; (vi) reduction in burned areas by 37.72 percent (2,032.05 km2 burned); (vii ) information and awareness campaign on the risks and damage caused by brush fires , involving the government, security services, civil society and the local population; (viii ) organization of national and international anti - desertification festivities; (ix ) campaign to construct manual and mechanical fire breaks and to put out brush fire s; and (x ) maintenance of 9,836 linear km of fire breaks. In the area of conservation , activities in the Banc d'Arguin National Park focused on : (i) sea surveillance of the perimeter of the park; (ii ) enhanced land surveillance of the park; (iii ) promotion of socioprofessional organizations; and (iv ) processing of traditional Imraguen products . To strengthen research capacit ies in the field of desertification, the key measures taken focused on : (i) preparation of a national anti -desertification action plan; (ii ) preparation of the documents needed for the establishment of a national desertification observatory (OND); (iii ) implementation of the strategic investment framework for sustainable land management ( SLM) in oasis zones; (iv ) enactment of the decree ratifying the Agreement on the Conservation of African -Eura sian Migratory Waterbirds ; and (v ) preparation of a draft law on biosecurity and biotechnological risks . PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 29 The government's efforts to protect the country's fauna had the fo llowing results : (i) preparation and distribution of regulations on the protection and development of fores t and fauna resources; and (ii) development and distribution of the implementing decree for the hunting code. To develop and enhance protected areas and wetlands, implementation of PRSP III resulted in the following : (i) development of a national strategy on protected areas; (ii ) international counting of waterbirds in Mauritania; (iii ) ongoing inventory of sites of biological interest; (iv ) continued implementation of development and management plans (PAG); (v ) completion of the revision of the Mauritanian Coastal Development Blueprint (PDALM); (vi ) completion of the project to reintroduce gazelles and white antel opes (addax ) into Diawling National Park; and (vii ) geographic delimitation and zoning of Star Bay for the creation of a protected area. III.3 PRSP cross -cutting areas A. Local self-governance In the area of local self-governance, significant progress has been made with decentralizati on and devolution as well as land-use planning. In the area of decentralization and devolution , measures taken involved : (i) consolidation of the institutional framework for decentralization ; (ii) improvement of governance and technical capacity -building in local governments ; and (iii) improving the institutional framework for territorial administration, which dates back to 1969, by adopting decree 2011.282 defining the attribution of territorial responsibilities and establishin g the organization of administrative districts. In both [sic] these areas, significant support was provided to communes and assistance or capacity -building was provided for elected officials and employees . Numerous actions were taken to strengthen devolution , particularly construction and/or rehabilitation and equipment of the residences of the administrative authorities. In the area of land-use planning , the authorities focused on reforms leading to : (i) the enactment of the framework law on land-use planning; (ii ) development, adoption and application of the decree on the organization and operation of the National Land -Use Planning Observatory (ONAT); (iii ) drafting of a decree on the creation and operation of the National Toponymic Commissio n (CNT); (iv ) drafting of decrees on the form, content and terms and condition s for the preparation and adoption of strategic land - use planning tools; and (v ) drafting of the decree on the organization and management of the settlement of nomads. B. Environmental governance In the area of environmental governance, efforts focused on : (i) restoration of the ecological balance of the tree and plan t cover and the conservation of wood, plant a nd agricultural resources; (ii ) enhancement of anti-desertification research capacit (iii) improved biodiversity conservation; (iv ) conservation of fauna; and (v ) development of protected areas and wetlands. The environmental dimension was taken into account in development strategies and programs , such as : (i) the development and dissemination of a series of strategic environmental assessments on the water, health and rural development sectors; (ii ) environmental assessment of 50 industrial activities; and (iii) drafting of a revision of the Enviro nmental Framework Law. Environmental governance was also strengthened by : (i) the completion of an institutional review of the environment sector in Mauritania (RISEM); (ii ) preparation of the second National Environmental Action Plan (PANE ) cycle covering the period 2012 -2016 and launching of an ambitious training plan; and (iii) development of a sizable data base including an effective monitoring -evaluation system for the environment sector . C. Emplo yment In the area of employment, measures in 2011 were concerned with : (i) improving the quality and relevance of technical and vocational training; (ii ) expan ding and diversif ying the available training; (iii ) improv ing the vocational competence of job seekers to improve their chances of finding employment; (iv ) promoti ng employment through partnerships with the private sector; (v ) promoti ng jobs for young people including through the recruitment of 132 civil servants ( civil administrators, general administrative attach\u00e9s ; and general administrative drafters) and of 54 senior IT technicians by the National Population and Secure Title Registration Agency ( ANRPTS ); and (vi) making use of innovative approaches and integration initiatives PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 30 principally by granting upgraded concessions to a number of qualified job seekers and creating over 1,500 long-term jobs in the context of the reorganization of the private security sector . PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 31 Box 1. Job Creation: a Major Lever for Poverty Reduction D. Microfinance and micro enterprise sector In the microfinance sector, consolidation efforts aimed at ensuring the viability of the sector were continued in 2011. Licensed microfinance institutions, in addition to the network of Savings and Loan Association s (CAPEC s), the National Union of Livestock Savings and Loan Associations ( UNCECEL ), and the National Union of Agricultural Savings and Loan Associations of Mauritania ( UNCACEM ), numbered 25, mainly in the Nouakchott area. Two large networks, the CAPECs and UNCACEM , stand out owing to the number of members, the volume of credit extended, and their accessibility . The volume of credit extended by these microfinance institutions in 2011 totaled UM 14 billion, an increase of 6 percent from 2010. This represents 7 percent of total net lending by the banking system. The volume of deposits recorded in 2011 declined 4.6 percent from 2010 levels , to UM 4.9 billion. This decline was due Given the demographic dynamics (young people under 24 make up 60 percent of the population), high annual growth in the labor force (5 percent), skills mismatch, and lack of job opportunities in labor intensive industries, the main strategic guidelines for the sector, outlined on the basis of the strategy papers on employment, vocational training, and new technologies, are centered around the following two main areas of intervention: (i) broadening the scope of job opportunities available to Mauritanians by tapping into all potential means of increasing job offerings, work opportunities, and higher incomes; and (ii) narrowing the mismatch between the skills of the national labor force and the needs of the economy by developing an appropriate training strategy that encompasses initial training, job training, and lifelong learning approaches capable of meeting the current and future needs of the national economy. In keeping with these guidelines, government policy action in 2011 led to the: (i) creation of more than 21,000 public sector jobs; (ii): 5,000 initial training places offered in 2011 compared to 2,200 in 2008, establishment of schools and specialized institutes (Mining, BTP, Agriculture, New technologies, Public Administration, Journalism and Justice); (iii) development of public/private partnership initiatives culminating in the training of 1 ,200 young people for unfilled vacancies in the artisanal fisheries sector and the informal sector (small trades and services); and (iv) the opening up of inclusiv e credit to over 2,500 persons with income -generating employment activities (BCM loans of UM 1.5 billion , Kuwaiti grant of US$800 million, ADB loan of UM 600 million through the Procapec network. Future efforts will focus on the: (i) implementation of th e Emel program in 2012, (ii) intensification of road building and BTP projects, (iii) continuation of the agricultural labor promotion program; (iv) organizational reform of the public administration; (v) addressing the situation of daily -paid workers; (vi ) the opening up of posts in the central administration to non -permanent staff (PNPs); (vii) raising the minimum wage (SMIG) and reforming the pension system; (viii) ongoing establishment of technical and vocational training schools for young people, with a view to dealing with the skills mismatch by bringing education streams more in line with the needs of the market; (ix) provision of incentives to high -labor -intensive industries, mainly in nascent sectors such as poultry rearing, the agro -food business, textiles, and tourism, and (x) improving access to credit, especially through microcredit and microfinance institutions. Main jobs created in 2011 : Sector Jobs created Civil service 1482 Mines 2744 Fisheries 1200 BTP 226 Agriculture 9375 Environment 644 Telecommunications 800 Services and Commercial Activities 617 Education 250 Self employment 2500 Total 20 138 PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 32 to the reduction in the level of deposits with the UNCACEM. The CAPECs hold close to 81 percent of deposits, while the UNCACEM and other institutions hold 12.8 percent and 5.3 percent , respectively. This volume of deposits represents just 2 percent of total deposits collected by the banking system through December 31, 2011. Borrowing decline d by 5.5 percent in 2011 from levels in 2010, essentially as a result of the decline in lending by the UNCACEM. Its liabilities represent 80 percent of total lending. Despite the financial difficulties of the network of CAPECs , their equity increased by mo re than 30 percent in 2011 from 2010 levels, mainlly as a result of the increase in the capital of the UNCACEM and other microfinance institutions . The main measures taken in 2011 in the microfinance and micro enterprise sector focused on : (i) updating of the national microfinance strategy for the period 2012 -2016; (ii ) increasing the supervision of microfinance institutions by setting up a team of inspectors for the sector (under way) ; (iii) develop ing and approv ing terms of reference for the purchase o f software allowing for the use of a chart of accounts specific to microfinance; (iv ) finaliz ing the microfinance -specific chart of accounts; and (v ) implement ing the action plan and completi ng the monitoring and evaluation of lines of credit as part of the National Integrated Micro and Small Enterprise Program (PNIME) . Implementation of the capacity -building project for the microfinance sector resulted in the following achievements : (i) rehabilitation, development and equipment of the nine CAPECs in Nouakchott; (ii) capacity -building for users; (iii ) preparation of a feasibility study on the mechanism for the refinancing of microfinance institutions; and (iv ) start-up of activities to fin ance partner microfinance institutions. The Commission on Human Rights, Humanitarian Action, and Civil Society Relations (CDHAHRSC ) implemented microfinance activities in 2011 that had a positive impact on the living conditions of the most vulnerable segm ents of the population : (i) identification and implementation of 25 income -generating activities for 25 victims of mines; (ii ) identific ation and implementation of 331 income - generating activities as part of the National Solidarity Program, phase 1; (iii ) identification and implementation of income -generating activities as part of the National Solidarity Program, phase 2; and (iv) financing of 97 income -generating activities for 97 groups. E. Gender equity , children and population policy In the area of gender equity , significant results were recorded owing to : (i) implementation of th e National Strategy for the Institutionalization of Gender Equity (SNIG); (ii ) improved access to education and training for women; and (iii ) increase in the economic power of women. Implementation of these actions has resulted in a marked improvement in the representation of women in politics, although at the same time their economic visibility remains very low. Despite Mauritania's ratification of a number of human rights conventions, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDEF), Mauritanian society remains affected by serious discrimination based on cultural traditions and attitudes . Numerous awareness raising campaigns a gainst social \"rigidities\" have been conducted and have changed attitudes somewhat. Actions targeting children have focused on the implementation of the National Strategy for the Protection of Children via : (i) increased ac cess for young children to high -quality preschool education at the national level and oversight and management of the sector; and (ii ) enhanced coordination and partnership s in favor of children. In this context the actions taken have made it possible to improve community action and mana gement, while emphasizing the development and dissemination of a parent education program at the community level. Population policy activities have focused on : (i) awareness -raising on population issues (gender, SR, youth, HIV/AIDS, etc. ) by decision -makers and the population; (ii ) introduction of initiatives to reduce maternal mortality; and (iii ) development and use of social democratic data to ensure reliable programming . F. Social protection The importance attached by the government to combating exclusion and poverty has resulted in significant efforts in the area of social protection. These efforts have focused on a full set of measures aimed at ensuring better protection for the population, particularly the most disadvantaged and poore st groups , against all types of social risks. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 33 The government's action focused on the development of a national social protection strategy . Pending its implementation , three basic aspects received particular attention in 2011 : (i) assistance for and management of indigence; (ii ) insurance; and (iii ) safety at work. The priority measures in the area of assistance for and management of indigence involved : (i) implementation of the program for the economic pr omotion of disadvantaged groups and development and implementation of the national strategy for the promotion of the disabled; (ii ) continu ed development of the program to combat begging; (iii) implementation of the program for conflict prevention and promotion of social cohesion; and (iv) continued implementation of the Program for the Eradication of the Vestiges of Slavery.

In the area of social protection insurance , the introduction of this dimension in the health system in Mauritania via the Nation al Health Insurance Fund (CNAM) represents an important mission for the pooling of health risks and social protection against unex pected expenditures that could affect the most disadvantaged individuals and the resulting pauperization of these persons. However, geographic coverage of the services of this institution is insufficient and the waiting period for refunds does not yet satisfy the users. To remedy these two deficiencies, the implementation of PRSP III in 2011 inc luded important actions to improve refund times from three months to four days through the use of mobile phone messages . The following institutional improvements were seen : (i) development of the National Social Protection Strategy; (ii ) development of a legal framework for social protection and national solidarity; (iii) implementation of the international conventions for individuals with specific needs; (iv ) revision of the laws establishing the CNSS; (v ) completion of a wide -ranging awareness campaign on social security; (vi) development and implementation of the strategy for the promotion of industrial medicine; (vii ) adoption of a law aimed at expanding the health insurance system to employees of local governments, projects , and other administrative structures; and (viii ) the organization by CNAM and CNSS of a regional seminar on the administrative and operational effectiveness of social protection .

These STCs, whi ch are technical structures involved in the PRSP review PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 37 mechanism, established in accordance with Decree No. 103 -2007 of April 12, 2007, concerning the reorganization of the institutional mechanism for the formulation, implementation, review, and evaluatio n of the PRSP, are decision -support bodies established within every ministerial department and they serve as the sectoral focal point for monitoring the poverty reduction program, in particular with regard to updating, monitoring, and evaluation of the PRS P, as well as the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). At the end of a series of meetings, the STCs discussed, finalized, and approved a report covering: (i) the review of the sector s for the year 2011; (ii) the main strengths, weakness es, opportunities, and risks; and (iii) the possible revision of the sectoral goals for the period 2012 -2015. The STC reports, were consolidated in line with the strategic pillars of the PRSP by the Department for the Monitoring and Evaluation of the PRSP , which serves as the Secretariat of Technical Committee on Poverty Reduction (CTLP), and were forward ed to the thematic technical groups (GTTs), which began their work on July 1, 2012. These groups, which are comprised of representatives from various sect ors (government, elected officials, civil society, the private sector, development partners) have served as places for reflection and the sharing of ideas on cross -cutting issues involved in the poverty reduction strategy. Following a series of meetings, the thematic technical groups finalized and approved a report covering: (i) the thematic report for the year 2011; (ii) the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats; and (iii) the possible revision of thematic objectives for the period 2012 -2015 with special emphasis on the cross -cutting issues. The last report, approved on September 11, 2012, was that of GTT 5 \"Monitoring and Evaluation.\" The approved reports were forwarded to the Technical Committee on Poverty Reduction, which reviewed the r eports, made improvements in the content of the reports and in the quality of the analysis contained therein, with a view to resubmission to the other consultative bodies, namely the Consultative Committee on Poverty Reduction and the Donors' Committee. The results of the work by these consultative committees were presented to the Interministerial Poverty Reduction Committee (CILP), which met on Tuesday November 13, 2012 under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister.The CILP endorsed the document, which wa s submitted to the national consultative assemblies for final approval.

III.6 Monitoring and evaluation For the year 2011, the PRSP monitoring and evaluation system provided for the development of a quarterly scorecard for the monitoring of seven spending sectors; the preparation of the annual report on the implementation of the PRSP; and the development, approval, and dissemination of a plan for operationalization of PRSP III monitoring. The PRSP institutiona l steering mechanism that was initially put into place rapidly revealed its limitations with the slowdown in the momentum of the thematic groups, the lack of connection between PRSP monitoring and the operational monitoring activities within the ministries , and the informal and irregular nature of the technical work and consultations related to the PRSP. It was only during the preparation of the third PRSP action plan that the Government began to look at the monitoring and evaluation system with a view to h aving a more formal and more effective mechanism, both in terms of its products and in terms of its participatory dimension. As a tangible result of this effort, the Council of Ministers created at its meeting on March 24, 2011, a special department to ser ve as the PRSP Secretariat. In 2012, a decree reorganizing the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development (No. 082 -2012 of May 21, 2012) assigned technical responsibility for the coordination of PRSP monitoring on the basis of this mechanism to a dedicat ed Department for PRSP Monitoring and Evaluation . The creation of this structure meets the need for a permanent entity responsible for the day -to-day coordination of all of the technical activities involved in the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the PRSP. In order to provide for consistent monitoring of the PRSP III, the various entities involved in monitoring the implementation of the PRSP have agreed on an information system for the monitoring and evaluation of the strategy. This informatio n system for PRSP monitoring and evaluation is based on a set of 74 indicators and organized around three components, called subsystems, which complement one another and are fully integrated. They are: (i) the subsystem for the Monitoring of Household Livi ng Conditions; (ii) the subsystem for Program and Project Monitoring; and (iii) the Impact Assessment subsystem. Subsystem for the Monitoring of Household Living Conditions PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 40 The purpose of this subsystem is provide for the systematic production and management of indicators that contain information about household living conditions. These are for the most part global impact indicators based on the monetary approach to poverty and the living conditions approach. The s ubsystem is comprised of six indicators . These indicators are regularly updated on the basis of statistical surveys. It is under the administrative responsibility of the National Statistical Office (ONS). Subsystem for Program and Project Monitoring The purpose of this subsystem is to monitor, through input and output indicators, the financial and physical execution of poverty reduction programs and projects. The monitoring of inputs is performed through the tracking of financial resources allocated for programs and projects. The monitoring of outputs resulting from the implementation of program and project activities is carried out through the tracking of services delivered within the framework of poverty reduction measures (such as the construction of s chools, health centers, water control infrastructure facilities, roads, etc.). This monitoring allows for an assessment of progress in the implementation of programs and projects intended to reduce poverty. It is supported by a set of 44 indicators . The da ta required for this purpose are derived for the most part from administrative records of structures, programs, and projects, as well as internal statistics of line ministries. This subsystem is managed through technical coordination between the line minis try and the Ministry of Finance. Impact Assessment Subsystem Impact assessment allows for the identification of changes that occur in the well -being of individuals belonging to a specific population and that can be attributed to a given program or policy. This involves studies pertaining to a specific project, program, or policy, and /or a well -defined population. The results of such assessments serve to direct decisions regarding the extension, modification, or elimination of a given policy, program , or project, and they also assist in the ranking of government activities by order of priority. This is a decision -support tool that has the advantage of increasing the visibility of programs for the population as a whole ( 24 indicators ). This subsystem i s under the technical coordination of the Department for Economic Policy and Development Strategies within the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development (DG PESD/MAED) . An ongoing dialogue was initiated in 2011 with the sectoral departments, in particu lar at the time of interim assessments, and this has allowed for the coordinated updating of information regarding changes in indicators, and in particular those pertaining to the Program and Project Monitoring subsystem . With the aim of providing for th e proper utilization and understanding of each indicator by the producers and users throughout the entire process of monitoring the implementation of the PRSP in 2011, trends in the indicator matrix were tracked through information from a data sheet, which contain ed the following information at a minimum: (i) basic information (name, stated objectives, ... ); (ii) method of production and quality of the indicator (mode of collection, calculation method, frequency, level of disaggregation, ...); (iii) responsible parties; (iv) interpretation techniques; (v) statistical series that are potentially available; and (vi) comments and miscellaneous information. The following activities were carried out in 2011 with regard to the reporting tools: (i) the preparation of quarterly scorecards for the seven spending sectors (the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR); the Ministry of Water Works and Sanitation (MHA); the Ministry of Equipment and Transport (MET); the Ministry of Petroleum, Energy, and Mines (MPEMi); the Ministry of Heal th (MS); the Ministry of State for National Education (MEEN); and the Ministry of Housing, Urban Development, and Land -Use Management (MHUAT); (ii) the drafting of an executive summary for the second quarter. Based on a more in -depth analysis, the executiv e summary is aimed at drawing lessons from the results for the first half of the current year with a view to the coming budget conferences to provide for program budgeting for the fiscal year; (iii) the launching of the preparation of data sheets based on the PRSP indicators; and (iv) the drafting of a Medium -Term Expenditure Framework for 2012 -2014, jointly with the Ministry of Finance within the context of the preparation of the 2012 budget law. With the aim of ensuring that monitoring has every chance o f success and enabling the various stakeholders to take ownership, the Government has started, within the framework of a participatory approach, to enhance monitoring on a regular basis by drawing on the contributions of all of the development stakeholders , through the introduction of a consultative process that involves governments bodies, elected officials, civil society, the private sector, and development partners. The present Post Implementation Review Report on the PRSP III in 2011 is the result of th is effort. Operationalization of PRSP III implementation monitoring PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 41 This operationalization was carried out in form of the elaboration, validation, and dissemination of a road map called \"the plan for operationalization of PRSP III monitoring,\" which w as based, in particular, on: (i) the elaboration and implementation of a priority action plan; (ii) the introduction and operationalization of the institutional mechanism for PRSP III implementation monitoring; and (iii) capacity building among the princip al stakeholders responsible for activating the institutional mechanism. The operationalization plan encompassed the following priority actions: (i) the performance of an information and public awareness phase for the PRSP III through: the posting of the d ocument online and its distribution via the Data Center mailing list, the distribution of a circular to all of the departments on the implementation of the PRSP III, the duplication and distribution of the document in Arabic and in French, and the organiza tion of a public awareness day for the benefit of key government bodies; (ii) capacity building of the PRSP Monitoring and Evaluation Department; (iii) operationalization of the PRSP monitoring and evaluation mechanism through: the revision of orders estab lishing and concerning the composition and organization of certain sectoral technical committees; the conception, production, and distribution of indicator data sheets; the finalization and validation of reporting tools (the production of quarterly scoreca rds, the production of a quarterly executive summary); (iv) the alignment of multi -year programming documents through the elaboration of the 2012 -2014 MTEF in accordance with the PRSP III; and (v) the regionalization of the PRSP through the elaboration and updating of Regional Poverty Reduction Programs (RPRPs) of certain wilayas. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 42 III.7 Lessons learned from implementation of the PRSP III in 2011 An analysis of the review of the first year of the implementation of the 2011 -2015 PRSP III allows one to conclude that Mauritania has clearly made progress, but still faces significant challenges on the path of economic and social development. In terms of governance, the following actions were carried out in 2011: (i) the initiation of an inclusive dialogue between the presidential majority and opposition political parties contributed to an easing of political tensions and the creation of a peac eful political climate, one that is favorable to increased investment and the promotion of growth. This dialogue also allowed for a strengthening of democracy through the criminalization of anti -constitutional changes and coups d'\u00e9tat, the consolidation of national unity through the recognition of cultural diversity, equal opportunity for both genders in access to jobs and elected office, the strengthening of the rule of law and the independence of the justice system, the criminalization of slavery and tort ure, which are classified as crimes against humanity, and the establishment of a permanent independent National Electoral Commission, as well as confirmation of the independence of the National Commission on Human Rights, which has become a Constitutional Consultative Body; (ii) the guarantee of fundamental individual and collective freedoms, including the freedom of expression and the freedom of peaceful assembly, which have been exercised on an almost daily basis; (iii) the liberalization of the audio -visual landscape through the granting of licenses to two private commercial television stations and five private commercial radio stations newly authorized within the country, marking the end of the government monopoly on news, which had been in effect since the country gained independence, and representing an important step in the country's democratic evolution. In addition, a major effort to promote human rights was launched through the completion of the organized repatriation of refugees and the granting of full rights to the refugees. Finally, significant progress was also achieved in the following areas: (i) measures were undertaken to align sectoral policies and strategies with the strategic pillars and objectives of the PRSP; (ii) the global MTEF for 2 012-2014 was elaborated as a programming tool that will allow for a connection to be established between the PRSP and the budget; (iii) efforts were undertaken to provide for the alignment of Public Development Assistance with national policies and priorit ies in accordance with the Paris Declaration; (iv) a participatory and iterative approach was taken to the process of drafting the PRSP III Post Implementation Review Report for the first year, based on sub -annual monitoring that allowed for the production of quarterly scorecards, a quarterly executive summary, and PRSP III indicator data sheets. In spite of this strong performance, the implementation of the PRSP III in 2011 was not free of problems and constraints that constitute obstacles to the achievement of the assigned objectives, such as: (i) the lack of ownership of the PRSP on the part of a number of stakeholders, in spite of efforts backed by information and consultations undertaken by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED); (ii) the weakness in human resource capacities is one of the main constraints in the area of progra mming and in the implementation and monitoring of development policies and programs; and (iii) a lack of financing sources for certain development programs and projects. In addition to the various weaknesses and constraints mentioned above, there are also constraints of an external nature. These include, in particular: (i) the economy's vulnerability to exogenous shocks , in particular the severe rainfall shortage and the threat of an acute food crisis; (ii) the significant drop in petroleum production , whi ch has resulted in a major adjustment in the country's macroeconomic outlook, a reduction in the public investment program, and recourse to a larger amount of foreign aid; and (iii) the global economic downturn , which has had negative repercussions for the major exporting sectors with a drop in external demand and in prices for major export goods (iron ore, copper, fish products). Nevertheless, the development challenges remain considerable. Mauritania is still ranked among the least developed countries, w ith a gross domestic product per capita of US$1,246 in 2011. The economy, which is not very diversified, is strongly influenced by external shocks. Work toward the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals has been proceeding at a slower pace for sev eral years now. The 2010 report shows that the major gaps are in the health sector, the environment, employment, and gender, although some progress has been made. Various components of the economic infrastructure are underdeveloped, and this represents a n obstacle to the development of the private sector and is a major constraint impeding economic growth. The weakness of infrastructure services (transportation, water and sanitation, telecommunications, electricity, and so on) means higher production costs , which in turn limit the competiveness of the economy. For example, the domestic road network is still primitive and does not provide for a connection between areas of production and areas of consumption. The generation of electricity falls short of deman d, which means higher prices, PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 43 which in turn limit access to electrical power. The urban electrification rate is below 50 percent, while the rural and semi -urban electrification rates are equal to 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively. With regard to water and sanitation, the proportion of the population with access to a source of safe drinking water was estimated at 58.3 percent in 2008, compared to a coverage rate of just 20.7 percent. In spite of the government's efforts to promote national unity, in pa rticular through programs for the reintegration of repatriated persons and the eradication of the legacy of slavery, reforms in the area of democratic and economic governance are still essential. Thus, democratic institutions need to be strengthened, the a nti-corruption campaign needs to be continued, and employment and poverty reduction policies need to be supported in order to reduce the risks of a weakening of social cohesion. In addition, the climate of insecurity that reigns in the subregion is another source of serious concern that requires quick -impact projects to create jobs for young people. The improvement of governance will continue to be a significant challenge to be met by the government through institutional capacity building within the admin istration with the aim of ensuring that it is capable of performing its mission of guiding the reforms and the implementation of macroeconomic and sectoral strategies. The challenges of environmental protection and coping with climate change will continu e to be a focus of concern on the part of the public authorities. Indeed, global warming has given rise to degradation of the country's natural resources, which is aggravated by the unsuitable methods being used in the exploitation of these resources; all of this leads to a serious imbalance between man and his environment and to the impoverishment of rural populations. Apart from the problems of desertification and deforestation, whose impact weighs heavily on the environmental balance and on the populatio n's living conditions, the country could be threatened by new risks linked to the petroleum and mining industries. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 44 IV. Outlook for 2012 -2015 PILLAR I: Acceleration of growth and stabilization of the macroeconomic framework Within the framework of the PRSP III, the Government set for itself medium -term objectives to consolidate macroeconomic stability and promote the creation of wealth with the aim of achieving growth rates capable of contributing to poverty reduction and the improvement of living condi tions for the population. In order to achieve these objectives, the strategy being pursued by the Government is based on the improvement of the macroeconomic framework, the deepening of structural reforms, the development of infrastructure to support grow th, and the optimal exploitation of natural resources. Stable and sound macroeconomic framework Macroeconomic objectives for 2012 -2015 The macroeconomic policies and structural reforms planned for 2012 -2015 will make it possible: (i) to achieve an avera ge annual GDP growth rate of 6 percent; (ii) to keep inflation in check so that it is equal to 5.7 percent at the end of the period; (iii) to reduce the budget deficit, including grants, to an average of 2.5 percent of non -oil GDP for the period; and (iv) to hold foreign exchange reserves equivalent to almost 4.4 months of imports by 2015. The main actions that are planned to achieve these objectives are: (i) the development of mining activities, and in particular the effective operation of the Guelb II project, which should bring production of the National Mining Industry Corporation (SNIM) up to approximately 14 million metric tons by 2015; (ii) the development of activities in the construction and public works sector; (iii) the relaunching of industria l units; (iv) the expected development of transportation and telecommunications services, in particular through the fiber optic project, as well as the development of business, hotel services, and banking services; (v) the implementation of sectoral invest ment programs focused on the improvement of living conditions for rural populations; and (vi) a rebound in agricultural production following favorable rainfall conditions. External sector Mauritania's foreign trade will be characterized over the medium t erm by two situations: (i) a deterioration in the balance of trade between 2012 and 2013 (an average deficit of US$114 million) due primarily to the EMEL [Hope] 2012 project and to the new Nouakchott international airport project; and (ii) an average trade surplus projected in the amount of US$165.3 million for 2014 -2015 on the expectation of a modest recovery in global demand. The increase in the average value of exports during this period (0.4 percent) should compensate somewhat for imports, albeit by a s mall amount, with imports expected to fall by 6.2 percent as a result of a decline related to the extractive industries. There will be an improvement in current account deficit to 12.7 percent of GDP for the 2013 -2015 period, compared to 19.5 percent of GDP in 2012. Nevertheless, this deficit will be entirely offset by official long - term borrowing in the amount of US$262 million and direct investments on the order of US$475 million per year throughout the entire period. The overall balance will thus regis ter an average annual surplus of US$247 million for the period. Basis of fiscal policy Fiscal policy will be marked by: (i) efforts to improve revenue collection, with government revenues (not including grants and oil) reaching an average of UM 366 billi on in 2012 -2015 (tax receipts account for 70 percent of this figure), which represents a growth rate of 13 percent per year; (ii) an increase in public spending of close to 11 percent per year, reaching UM 432 billion. The growth in spending will be modera te starting in 2013, however, due to a gradual decline in the expenditures on subsidies and transfers, which will fall from UM 102 billion in 2012 to around UM 70 billion in 2015. Thus, the underlying budget balance, with a deficit equal to 0.9 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012, should see a gradual improvement and reach a surplus of 1.2 percent of non -oil GDP in 2015; (iii) the introduction of a master plan for public finance reform covering all of the reforms related to the preparation, execution, control, a nd transparency of the budget; (iv) the pursuit of efforts aimed at a broadening of the tax base and improving tax collection; and (v) the introduction of a unique identification code that is to take effect this year, accompanied by continued implementatio n of the plan to collect tax arrears. Furthering structural reforms PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 45 The implementation of reforms and the adoption of measures to support small and medium -sized businesses and industries, and reforms related to the tax regime in order to support private sector activities, will continue to be the principal concerns of public authorities throughout the 2012 -2015 period. Private sector development Development of the private sector will continue through the improvement of the investment climate. In this connection, a new investment code, which has already been drafted, is to be presented soon to the Council of Ministers for approval. All of the administrative procedures involving the creation of enterprises or investment will be simplified and reorganized within the framework of a one -stop shop concept as provided for under the new code. The Government is also committed to implementing a national strategy for the development of skills tailored to the needs of the sector. In addition, activities directed at the development of this sector will be undertaken within the context of the implementation of the project to improve the economic climate and the creation of a study fund aimed at the promotion of investments. Reform of incentive systems The planned re forms of incentive systems involve the pursuit of customs reform through: (i) the modernization of the computer system, its integration and widespread application, as well as the adoption and implementation of a new Customs Code; (ii) the establishment of high standards for customs officials; (iii) the creation of deferred customs inspection sites at the local level; (iv) the creation of a risk management unit; (v) the connection of deferred inspection sites, ex -post inspection units, risk management units, and information units to ASYCUDA ; (vi) the establishment of a mechanism for consultation and communication between the customs service and the private sector; (vii) the preparation of a study for the creation of customs collector procedures; and (viii) th e drafting and implementation of a special statute concerning customs personnel. Establishment of procedures to facilitate the financing of the economy Over the medium term, inflation will be maintained at year -on-year increase of approximately 6 percen t, based on a prudent monetary policy. The money supply will increase by 13.9 percent, which represents a more moderate increase than in 2011, which saw growth in the money supply of close to 20 percent. The Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) will consolidate gains in monetary policy through: (i) the securitization of the BCM loan to the Treasury; (ii) the modernization of the foreign exchange market; (iii) encouraging the creation of a specialized structure in the debt repurchase process; (iv) the definition and adoption of selection criteria for external certified public accountants and auditors who are eligible for the certification of lending institutions with a view to enhancing the reliability and credi bility of information and documents; (v) strengthening of the audit and internal control functions at banks; (vi) an increase in the minimum capital of banks to UM 4.5 billion at the end of 2010 and to UM 6 billion at the end of 2012; (vii) the performance of an international audit of banks at least every other year, and measures to ensure the systematic implementation of the recommendations contained in the audit report; (viii) the introduction of regulations granting the BCM the right to oversee insurance companies; (ix) encouraging the opening of offices outside of Nouakchott and Nouadhibou with the aim of increasing the availability of banking services; (x) preparation for the financial system's transition to the new international Basel II regulations; (xi) preparation for the transition to the new International Accounting Standards/International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS) through the updating of the accounting framework specific to banks; (xii) the introduction of an automated information c enter; (xiii) the drafting of a law on the recovery of debts; (xiv) the introduction of a system for the sharing of data between the BCM and banks; and (xv) the promotion and introduction of bank transfers in the banking clearance system in accordance with international standards. The financing of the economy will be strengthened through: (i) the movement through official channels of financial transactions that are currently handled through the informal network, based on the development of a range of attr active financial products; (ii) regulation of the networks currently engaged in microfinance activities without authorization; (iii) the development of Islamic financial products by encouraging banks to design a range of financial products that meet the re quirements of Islamic Shariah law; (iv) the development of the Deposit and Development Fund; and (v) encouraging the establishment of credit unions and mutual savings banks in rural areas. Greater liberalization of business activities PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 46 Efforts aimed at greater liberalization of business activities will be pursued through: (i) the definition of systems to protect private property rights; (ii) the definition of a strategy to counter anti -competitive practices; (iii) the definition of a leg al framework governing the granting of public assistance; (iv) the implementation of a program to support business and the private sector; and (v) the development and implementation of a legal framework governing competition. The enforcement of legislation on competition will continue to be limited, however, in the absence of a strong and independent agency overseeing competition. Development of growth -supporting infrastructures Following several years of reforms in the transportation sector, the Governm ent has recently consolidated its strategy for the sector for 2011 -2025. This strategy is based on an in -depth diagnosis of the current situation in the sector. The Government has also adopted a transportation sector policy statement and has drafted a medi um-term investment program (2011 -2015) for the implementation of this strategy. The general objectives established for the transportation sector for 2011 -2025, with a view to achieving the national vision expressed in the PRSP III, are aimed at: (i) contr ibuting to the development of national and regional trade; (ii) lowering production costs; (iii) strengthening the competitiveness of the national economy; and (iv) integrating rural or isolated areas with large concentrations of people living in poverty.

PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 49 Box 3. The Deposit and Development Fund 1. Introduction The Deposit and Development Fund (CDD) was created in accordance with Law No. 027 -2011 of March 17, 2011, with the aim of responding to the persistent structural challenges in the country's economy, the handling of which requires the establishment of an independent institution with good governance and a large degree of autonomy in terms of management, as well as si gnificant financial, operational, and human resources, and assistance from external partners. It fills out the national financial landscape with its positioning as a source of medium - and long -term project financing. The establishment of this institution is also a response to the set of recommendations outlined by donors, namely: (i) it is a response to the historically weak capacity for project implementation, which was highlighted by development partners; (ii) it offers the capacity to provide for more e fficient and more rapid handling of the range of procedures for gaining access to lines of credit, thanks to management autonomy with respect to central administrative bodies; (iii) it follows the donors' recommendation calling for the management of major projects to be assigned to specific units, and not to public administrative services responsible for day -to-day management; (iv) it is a response to concerns expressed by development partners regarding the responsibility for exchange rate risk associated w ith the granting of lines of credit in foreign currency, with the CDD assuming responsibility for management of this risk in accordance with Article 68 of the law on establishment of the CDD. 2. Mission The CDD is a financial institution that makes mediu m- and long -term investments. Another element of its mission is the management of projects or funds under a mandate, and it may delegate a certain number of activities to subsidiaries. 3. Management mandate A management mandate has been assigned to the CD D together with the Government for the management of a national program to provide employment assistance and support for small and medium -sized businesses. The aim of the national program to provide employment assistance and support for small and medium -sized businesses is to provide financing for income -generating activities and to promote employment among three categories of beneficiaries: (i) registered unemployed persons; (ii) residents of poor districts; and (iii) small and medium -sized businesses. 4. Sectoral support The financial sector Article 65 of the law on the creation of the CDD states that loans granted by the Development Department must be provided in the form of co -financing with other banking institutions. Two different paths have been ex plored within this context: (i) improvement of guarantee mechanisms for domestic credits; and (ii) the development of Islamic financing. The private sector The CDD intends to provide active support for projects serving as catalysts for the development of the private sector, through: (i) the granting of financing to small and medium -sized businesses. The identification of projects that are eligible for financing will be carried out by the CDD in close partnership with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED), as well as the employers, and on the basis of a database that contains all of the projects that have already been identified but have not yet received financing; (ii) support for the creation, as promoted by the MAED, of a technology cen ter in Mauritania that is capable of hosting new activities generated as a result of the country's connection to the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) international submarine broadband cable, such as offshoring activities. An international consulting firm shoul d be hired to conduct a study on this matter. The housing sector In terms of development, the housing sector is one of the priority sectors for action by the CDD. The CDD would like to be involved, with the participation of the Ministry of Housing, Urban Development, and Land -Use Management, in a residential complex and/or low -cost housing project that would be part of a housing capacity building effort in Nouakchott, and in the large cities and mining settlements in the interior of the country. In a ddition, the Government is planning to assign to the CDD the management of the Housing Support Fund, which is in the process of being established. 5. Partnership and technical support Two international partners have contributed to laying the technical gro undwork for the CDD and are continuing to provide essential support to the Fund in order to allow for a better mastery of the core skills required in this field: (i) t he French Caisse des D\u00e9pots et Consignations; and (ii) the Lazard Fr\u00e8res business group. Two national partners have been approached with a view to developing collaboration that would serve the goals of the various parties: (i) the National Union of Mauritanian Employers (UNPM); and (ii) the Mauritanian Professional Banking Association. 6. Review of activities in 2011 The CDD launched its operations with the adoption of a number of texts establishing the Fund's operating conditions, with a focus on three fronts: (i) the need for technical support on the part of specialists in the deposit fun d model; (ii) the recruitment of people with the skills necessary for the start -up of the institution; and (iii) the acquisition of resources. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 50 For the livestock sector, the priorities are: (i) economic development of livestock production and management of pastoral areas; (ii) implementation of a project to support the functioning of the mechanism for the inspection and certification of animal products to promote quality and improve competitiveness; (iii) development of red meat production; (iv) implementation of a program to develop the dairy sector (southern dairy basin); and (v) construction of the poultry complex. With regard to rural development , some major activities are planned: (i) implementation of a poverty reduction project in Aftout Sud and in Karakoko (Phase II) through: soil restoration, mobilization and management of surface water, support for agricultural and animal husbandry systems, and systems f or the economic development of natural resources and support for local development; (ii) continued work on implementation of the program for the development of irrigation -based agriculture in the valley (PDIAIM III); (iii) implementation of the program to open up agricultural production areas; (iv) implementation of the program for the development of Lake R'Kiz (II); (iv) implementation of the program for the rehabilitation of large tracts of land (CPB); and (v) implementation of the program for the rehabil itation of large tracts of land (PPG2). PILLAR II: Anchoring growth in the economic environment of the poor The rural sector has an important social role to play in Mauritania's development. Poverty is concentrated in rural areas and that is why it is rea sonable that the rural sector constitutes a basic pillar of development with regard to various program tools (PRSP -National Food Security Strategy (SNSA) and its National Agricultural Investment and Food Security Program, known as PNIA/SA). For this sect or, the objectives set within the PRSP III framework up to 2015 are: (i) to promote sustainable solutions for the development of food security; (ii) to encourage the entry of a modern, productive, and competitive agricultural sector into national, regional , and international markets; and (iii) to encourage better integration of livestock production into the economy, while strengthening its strategic role in food security and in poverty reduction. These objectives are complemented by those that have been id entified in the area of rural development, namely: (i) an increase in the land area in use and under cultivation, by strengthening engineering structures for water management and key infrastructure elements; and (ii) improved access to production zones and to basic socio -economic infrastructure facilities. The principal objective of the PNIA/SA, which is organized around four programs focused on the vital subsectors of agriculture, livestock production, fishing, and the environment, as well as a cross -cutting program broken down into four subprograms, is to strengthen food security through actions targeted directly at the most vulnerable populations living in rural areas. These actions consist of the following: (i) community support for water catchment areas; (ii) the promotion of water conservation techniques; (iii) the implementation of a poverty reduction program through support for the sectors; (iv) the performance of a general census of agriculture and livestock production; (v) implementation of a p rogram for the construction and rehabilitation of 10 dams and a project for the rehabilitation of 16 dams in Assaba; (vi) the implementation of an integrated development program in the Garak -Sokam region; (vii) the implementation of a program for the devel opment of water lines in the valley and a program for the development and improvement of irrigated land in villages (Phase I - 12,000 hectares); (viii) the implementation of a program for the agricultural development of wetland areas (the Tamouret Naaje de velopment); (ix) the implementation of a program for integrated development in rural areas in the northern part of Mauritania; (x) support for the improvement of agricultural production through the promotion of small -scale irrigation; (xi) improved access to land; (xii) capacity building of veterinary services; (xiii) capacity building of national research, training, and agricultural extension systems, and the strengthening of the program delivery capacity of the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR); (xiv) c ontinued renovation of the National Agricultural Training and Extension School (ENFVA) in Ka\u00e9di; and (xv) the implementation of a demonstration project in the zone under irrigation. In the area of food security , the National Food Security Strategy to 2015 includes the National Agricultural Investment and Food Security Program, as well as a priority action plan. The overall objective of this strategy is to \"enable populations, in particular the most vulnerable ones, to have physical and economic access at a ny time to an adequate, healthful, and balanced diet.\" PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 51 Box 4: EMEL (Hope) Program I. Context Like most countries in the Sub -Saharan region, Mauritania this year suffered from one of the highest precipitation deficits in a decade. Compared to the 1971 -2000 normal, 60 percent of stations reported a significant deficit, while the distribution of rainfall in 2011 was similar to 2002, which was classified as a major drought year. This deficit resulted in worrisome pasture conditions and a signi ficant reduction in agricultural output. The decline in agricultural output was a matter of some concern in that agriculture involves 67 percent of the population and contributes about 17 percent of GDP. In an average year, grain crops meet 30 percent of the country's consumption needs, with 60 percent of this output coming from rain -fed cultivation, which is the primary, if not only, activity of the majority of the most vulnerable segments of the population. In some areas of the country, rain -fed agricult ure accounts for as much as 80 percent of households' food supplies. This was not true, however, this year. Surveys conducted by specialized services of the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) forecast a significant decline in national agricultural output from the various rain -fed subsystems. The most optimistic forecasts suggest a 75 percent decline in output, from around 120,000 metric tons in 2011 to 29,000 metric tons this year. The livestock sector, which totally or partially involves around 60 percen t of the country's labor force and contributes 12 percent of GDP, will also see its important role undercut owing to the precipitation deficit and irregularity of precipitation, which have had generally adverse effects on pasture conditions . Rising grain prices on the international markets have a direct impact on the national market, increasing the pressure on the supply and prices of imported products. This decline in agricultural and livestock output as a result of the 2011 -2012 drought is combined with upward trends in prices for staple foodstuffs, increasing the already real vulnerability of rural and semi -urban populations. In this context and in order to offset the effects of these exceptional circumstances on the population and cattle, the governmen t has implemented the Emel 2012 sectoral intervention program . II. Components This program has two components: combating poverty and ensuring the availability of staple foodstuffs for needy segments of the population . Component 1: food: consisting primarily of : (i) Village Solidarity Food Stocks (SAVS) intended for low -income rural households and nomadic livestock -raising by providing food and cattle feed at subsidized prices; (ii) free distribution of food to households without income that are seriously affected by the drought; and (iii) the \"2011 solidarity shop,\" the continuation of which is necessary to increase the purchasing power of low -income households in rural, urban and semi -urban areas . Component 2: livestock assistance : consisting o f (i) livestock feed ; (ii) animal health services ; (iii) pasture irrigation; and (iv ) livestock loans . III. Monitoring of program implementation The mechanism for monitoring program implementation is active at all levels of the pyramid (centrally via the Interministerial Monitoring Committee (CIMS) and Technical Monitoring Committee (CTS) and sectoral coordination, regionally via the Regional Monitoring Committees (CRS), and departmentally via the Departmental Monitoring Committees (CDS)).

The SNSA and its PNIA/SA have been translated into a priority action plan up to 2015, which provides for preventive measures that target information and early warning systems at food insecurity and vulnerable groups, as well as various actions covering the sub -areas of emergency assistance and micro -development projects. Box 5. Overview of the National Food Security Strategy 1. Rationale and issues In Mauritania, food insecurity affects 26 percent of the population, primarily in rural areas, with women, children under five years of age, young people, small -scale producers, disabled persons, and the unemployed the most affected. This is a phenomenon that is both structural and cyclical in nature, and it has become chronic. With support from their technical and financial partners, Go vernment authorities have undertaken commendable efforts to gain control of the problem, which remains a major concern at all levels: from availability (low productivity of agricultural systems) to accessibility (low income linked to poverty), as well as price stability and stability of supply (problems that are exacerbated by climate change as well as the global energy and financial crisis). 2. Vision The SNSA, in harmony with the PRSP III and using flexible and transparent coordination and management mechanisms, is intended to revive food production and addresses different cross -cutting aspects of food security. In order to achieve this, the process of drafting the SNSA was participatory (with the involvement of stakeholders at the national, regional, and local levels), it was broadly inclusive (involving a synergy with technical and financial partners at the national, regional, and international levels), it was consultative (with sectoral departments), and it was dynamic (taking into account thematic s tudies, conflict sensitivity, social stability, and decentralization). 3. Objectives The overall objective of the SNSA is \"to enable populations, in particular the most vulnerable ones, to have physical and economic access at any time to an adequate, hea lthful, and balanced diet.\" The following principal specific objectives stem from this overall objective: (i) promotion of a diversified rural and peri -urban economy that is socio -economically profitable and adapted to climate change; (ii) improvement of commercial trade routes and intra -national, cross -border, and regional trade; (iii) sustainable improvement of access by vulnerable groups in rural and urban areas to food allowing for a healthful and balanced diet; (iv) strengthening of centralized and de centralized mechanisms for the prevention and management of food crises; and (v) promotion of good governance in terms of food security based on decentralization and local development. 4. Implementation The effective and efficient implementation of the SNSA requires guiding principles, a programmatic framework, a coordination mechanism, financing, and risk mitigation. 4.1. Guiding principles PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 53 (i) The multi -dimensional and multi -sectoral nature of the SNSA; (ii) the importance of regional scales when deciding on which actions to take; (iii) the innovative nature and decision -making role of the stakeholders; (iv) the institutionalization of ongoi ng multi -stakeholder and inter -institutional consultations; (v) fairness and objectivity in decision -making; (vi) the adaptation of government functions; (vii) capacity building among local stakeholders; (viii) consistency among the actions and strategies of stakeholders at all levels; (ix) coordination of actions and investments by the Government as well as those of development partners. 4.2. Programmatic framework The SNSA is supported by a national agricultural investment and food security program (PN IA/SA) based on four essential pillars: management of land and water, access to markets, the food supply, and agricultural research, which are consistent with those of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) and are covered by 10 d ifferent programs. 4.3. Coordination of the implementation of the SNSA and the PNIA/SA The institutional framework and the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms of the SNSA and the PNIA/SA are based on the mechanisms provided for under the PRSP III. They include the following bodies at various levels: a reference body, a decision -making body, a coordination and consultation body, and a small SNSA and PNIA/SA management and monitoring and evaluation unit. 4.4. Financing The planned budget for the implemen tation of the SNSA up to 2015/2020 is UM 310,639.587 million. 4.5. Conditions and risks associated with implementation of the SNSA (i) The conditions are essentially the adoption of the investment program by the Government and the mobilization of resourc es; (ii) the risks are of an institutional nature (failure to honor commitments, etc.), an economic nature (rise in prices, etc.), and an environmental nature (flooding, environmental degradation, etc.). During the next four years, from 2012 to 2015, \"the prevention and management of food crises\" will be undertaken through: (i) the implementation of a program to consolidate the prevention capacities of the Commission on Food Security (CSA) through the implementation of the following priority actions: c ontinued reinforcement of methodological tools for monitoring the food and nutrition situation; capacity building in the design of food security programs; creation of a system for monitoring major risks; improvement of the agricultural meteorological, hydr ological, and meteorological forecasting systems; strengthening of the food security monitoring center and improvement of the food security information mechanism; and (ii) implementation of an operational capacity building program for the Commission on Foo d Security. Within the subarea of emergency relief, the assistance program for vulnerable populations in 2012 -2015 will be carried out through: (i) the care for and nutritional recovery of children suffering from severe malnutrition and in need of emergen cy treatment, as well as care for pregnant or nursing women; (ii) implementation of an emergency assistance program; and (iii) implementation of an emergency assistance and relief program for victims. The subarea of \"micro -development projects\" in 2012 -2015 will see the implementation of a program to reduce the vulnerability of populations to exogenous shocks through: (i) the implementation of a program for the creation and rehabilitation of community production infrastructures; (ii) the creation and stren gthening of village food security stocks for better alignment of inventories; (iii) the consolidation and reorganization of village food security stocks; and (iv) the implementation of a micro -sales program for food security. The outlook in terms of urban development in 2012 -2015 is based on the guidelines set forth in the PRSP III, the objectives of which are still relevant, and with which the new government commitments will be aligned. In the area of urban planning , the government's actions will be aime d at: (i) the updating of the urban development plans for Nouakchott and other regional capitals; (ii) the elaboration of local urban development plans for towns in the interior of the country; (iii) finalization of the simplified general regulations on ur ban planning and the implementing texts of the urban planning code; (iv) the adoption of PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 54 implementing texts of the general regulations on construction and the law on the delegation of contracting authority; (v) the finalization and validation of the develo pment plan for the Nouakchott city center; (vi) the creation of an urban monitoring center; (vii) completion of the Nouakchott restructuring program; (viii) the launching of projects for the expansion and modernization of the towns of Zouerate, Boulenoir, and Aleg; (ix) the performance of a study on the restructuring of vulnerable districts and ex -post evaluations of experiences; (x) the completion of infrastructure projects and termination of the restructuring of vulnerable districts in Nouadhibou; (xi) th e rehabilitation and renovation of the town of Tintane; and (xii) the implementation of an urban development program in regional capitals. In the area of housing , the efforts by public authorities will be focused on carrying out the following actions: (i) the creation and introduction of a housing support and assistance fund; (ii) the preparation of a draft law on shared ownership in Mauritania; (iii) the adoption of the revised study regarding the 2005 law on real estate development; (iv) the implementati on of a program to build 6,000 homes intended for government officials; (v) the implementation of a project to build 118 homes in Teyarett, 50 homes in Chami, and the ISKAN headquarters; (vi) the implementation of programs for the development parcels of la nd in Nouakchott to make them buildable, using resources generated from the marketing of parcels financed under the Urban Development Program; (vii) the implementation of a project consisting of 3,163 parcels in the expansion of the module M development, T evragh Zeina, and North Arafat; and (viii) a project to build 600 homes in Zou\u00e9rate. In the building sector, priority will be given to the implementation of the following actions: (i) the construction and renovation of administrative buildings (mosques, youth centers, schools, hospitals, health clinics, etc.); (ii) the implementation of a program to prot ect towns vulnerable to flooding; (iii) the construction/renovation and expansion of health facilities; and (iv) the launching of PQE 3 (wilayas in the north). In view of the fact that microfinance is the main source for the financing of income -generating activities among the poor, in 2003 the Government adopted a national microfinance strategy that is still relevant for the third PRSP action plan. The objective is to improve access for the economically active poor to viable and sustainable financial servi ces with the aim of reducing poverty. The action plan in the area of microfinance for 2012 -2015 will consist of: (i) the implementation of agricultural lending and financing for the rural sector, and its extension to all sectors of production (vegetable f arming, flood -recession crops); (ii) the creation of agro -pastoral development funds and microcredit banks; (iii) elevation of the institutional level of microfinance guidance; (iv) the creation of a microfinance advisory committee; (v) the adoption of a t ax system appropriate to microfinance sectors; (vi) raising awareness of the new regulatory requirements among stakeholders (Association of Microfinance Professionals and Stakeholders (APROMI), microfinance institutions, accounting firms, etc.); (vii) use of a new chart of accounts by microfinance institutions; (viii) adoption and dissemination of financial education tools; (ix) support for the APROMI; (x) the establishment of a recovery plan for the Credit and Savings Association Promotion Agency (PROCAPEC ); (xi) the updating and adoption of the National Microfinance Strategy (SNMF); (xii) capitalization on experiences of countries in the subregion; (xiii) institutionalization of the Beit el Mal microfinance entity and the creation of two new agencies; and (xiv) seeking financing from the SNMF and the establishment of a program to support the implementation of the SNMF. For micro - and small businesses , the public authorities are going to carry out the following actions in 2012 -2015: (i) assessment of the im pact of lines of credit on the micro - and small business beneficiaries; (ii) assessment of the impact of micro - and small businesses on the economic environment; (iii) revitalization and expansion of the micro - and small business database in three wilayas to allow for a new focus; (iv) identification of dynamic and sustainable formal and informal micro - and small businesses; (v) development and drafting of guides for entrepreneurs (in Arabic and French); (vi) modular training in the management of micro - and small businesses and small and medium -sized businesses; (vii) the creation of micro - and small businesses and small and medium -sized businesses on the basis of tender documents; (viii) the formalization of micro - and small businesses (support and advice f or legal recognition); (ix) the identification of and support for pilot simulation projects; (x) raising awareness among private economic operators of the National Strategy for Micro - and Small Business (SNMPE) and the National Integrated Microbusiness Pro gram (PNIME); (xi) the organization of a forum/focus group of economic operators to encourage a win -win partnership with micro - and small businesses; (xii) the organization of a business start-up day (recruitment of consultants and distribution of entrepre neurial manuals); (xiii) raising awareness of entrepreneurial activity among students (graduates of the university and professional training institutes); (xiv) the training of young people in masonry trades, seeking support from the International Labour Or ganization (ILO), in particular; (xv) the use of local materials in public construction projects; and (xvi) the use of stone in the construction of city sidewalks. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 55 The strategy behind the promotion and economic development of natural capital in the 2011 -2015 PRSP, which is still relevant, was the result of the Government's belief that the degradation of renewable natural capital keeps people trapped in poverty, from which they cannot escape by migrating to the cities, and that efforts aimed at breaking the se vicious circles of poverty, linked to the depletion of renewable resources, must be undertaken in order to provide for growth that is favorable to the poor. This strategy, whose objectives are still timely, will consist primarily of: (i) meeting the bu lk of the needs of the poor from their natural environment; (ii) reducing the economic cost of environmental degradation; and (iii) developing sustainable financing mechanisms for the environment in keeping with the principles established in the national s trategy for sustainable development. The action plan related to the economic development of natural capital and corresponding to the 2012 - 2015 period involves: (i) finalizing the introduction of economic assessments and assessments of services provided by ecosystems in the establishment of environmental accounts; (ii) development of natural resources through the promotion of an appropriate and sustainable public -private partnership; (iii) the implementation of adaptation measures; (iv) an emphasis on peri -urban reforestation activities through the use of a labor -intensive approach; (v) reforestation of silviculture areas with multiple economic values; (vi) the utilization of various available methods (assisted natural regeneration (RNA), agro -forestry, reforestation, and preserves); (vii) the introduction of systems for \"payment for ecological services\"; (viii) greater integration of organizations engaged in the utilization of resources into the environmental sector; (ix) encouraging more widespread applicat ion of techniques that allow for sustainable use of resources; (x) the study and structural organization of various links in the wood/energy sector; (xi) reforestation of silviculture areas; (xii) sustainable management of protected marine and coastal area s; (xiii) special attention for protected marine areas (AMPs); (xiv) the development of the concept of added value for waste recycling; and (xv) further promotion of the concept of green employment. The national policy regarding social protection is aimed at improving the standard of living for disadvantaged persons and the advancement of disabled persons. Over the past three decades, factors linked to climate change and the economic environment have had a strong impact on social conditions. This impact has been felt in particular in the deterioration of traditional mechanisms and systems of solidarity, in profound disruptions in the organizational system of society and in stratification, in the decli ne in living conditions, in the abandonment of children, marginalization and urban exclusion, juvenile delinquency, crime, and social deviance. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 56 Box 6. National Social Protection Strategy (SNPS) Benchmarks 1. Definition and contextual introduction By definition, social protection encompasses an entire range of public investments and initiatives, both formal and informal, that are capable of directly addressing the risks, vulnerab ility, and chronic poverty. Social protection is a right that is recognized by most international conventions on human rights, starting with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which guarantees the right to social security, to decent work, an d to an adequate standard of living. Four dimensions of social protection are identified: measures involving prevention, protection, promotion, and transformation. Social protection is increasingly being perceived around the world as a key component of poverty reduction strategies. It also contributes to economic growth and provides essential support to accelerating the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is one of the priorities of the Social Policy of the African Union (AU). The Social Protection Floor is one of the nine global initiatives adopted by the Secretary General of the United Nations to address the economic and financial crisis. The process of the adoption of recommendations regarding the establishment of the Social Pr otection Floor by the International Labour Conference is under way. 2. Overview of the diagnosis, vision, objectives, pillars, and basic principles of social protection in Mauritania: (i) a formal social security system that provides poor coverage and neg lects the most vulnerable groups; (ii) inadequate and inequitable financial resources that do not provide for a health care system that is accessible to all; (iii) a structural and chronic food insecurity situation, above all in rural areas, and the lack o f operational mechanisms to address risks, disasters, and the effects of climate change; (iv) an elevated malnutrition rate (with chronic malnutrition at 40.1 percent in 2008 and acute malnutrition at 15.6 percent); (v) efforts related to protection for ch ildren, the advancement of women, support for disabled persons, and social action for disadvantaged persons are still limited; (vi) an educational system characterized by troubling disparities in access to school and student retention; (vii) a high overall unemployment rate (31.2 percent in 2008), in particular among women and young people; and (viii) irregular global assessments of the impact and continuation of programs targeted at basic services (water, sanitation, housing, electricity). 3. Given this s ituation, the elaboration and implementation of a national social protection strategy is a priority for Mauritania and this will without a doubt make the greatest contribution to achieving the overall objective of reducing poverty by targeting the most vul nerable segments of society and seeking to establish a balanced allocation of investments. The added value of this action is to get the most vulnerable communities involved in core efforts to promote the country's development. Furthermore, this social protection strategy will be introduced in conjunction with the initiatives and programs being carried out as part of the PRSP. 4. National vision with regard to social protection In accordance with the vision of the PRSP III, Mauritania intends to become a modern country that is administratively and economically sound and decentralized, politically stable, democratic, and well integrated into the family of nations, focused on the consolidation of national unity, economic and socially harmonious developmen t, and the improvement of living conditions for the urban and rural populations, above all those who are most vulnerable. Within the framework of the national social protection strategy, together with the sectoral strategies, the aim is to permanently est ablish better conditions for equality, good governance, human dignity, justice, and social solidarity, as well as for social protection, prevention, promotion, and transformation. These conditions will enable all segments of society that are disadvantaged or vulnerable to cope with climate, environmental, social, political, and economic risks and to gain access to all basic services and infrastructure facilities. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 57 5. Objectives, strategic pillars, principles, and key actions The overall objective of the social protection strategy is to contribute to an alleviation of the vulnerability of disadvantaged groups and to help populations cope with the most significant risks of life. There are five specific objectives and they align perfectly with the strategic pillars: (i) to contribute to efforts to reduce food and nutritional insecurity and to address climate change; (ii) to reduce barriers related to access to health and education services; (iii) to strengthen social security and promote labor and employment; (iv) to improve living conditions through equal access to basic social infrastructure facilities; to improve and step up social assistance activities and activities to promote the welfare of various groups; (v) to strengthen and put into place programs ba sed on the strategic pillars, in coordination with the PRSP; (vi) to develop and provide for the application of new governance related to social protection; to stimulate the kind of growth that is equitable and favorable to the poor, while supporting the m ost vulnerable groups to ensure that they participate in development while benefiting fully from its advantages; (vii) to oversee effective integration of social protection measures into the sectoral strategies; (viii) to strengthen national solidarity thr ough mechanisms aimed at promoting equity; and (ix) to put into place sustainable financing mechanisms for social protection. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 58 7. Budget analysis and mechanisms for the mobilization of resources An analysis of the public financing of social protection expenditures in 2010 and 2011 shows that the national solidarity effort based on public resources entails the financing of a number of interventions in the form of a safety net, social assistance actions, care for the poor, promotion of employment among yo ung unemployed persons, and emergency assistance and relief programs, as well as more structural actions for the financing of productive assets. The new mechanisms proposed for expanding the fiscal space are: The creation of a tax designated as a social s olidarity contribution (CSS); An increase in tax revenues through a reduction in tax evasion and an increase in the tax burden; An increase in the budget deficit to the equivalent of 1 percent of GDP per year; Additional taxes on the National Fund for Hydr ocarbon Reserves; The development of advocacy efforts to mobilize additional external donations; The strict enforcement of measures to make spending more efficient; The reallocation of resources; Operationalization and consolidation of the Social Solidarity Fund (FSS) through: (i) the institutionalization of the Zakat foundation; (ii) contribution to the national social solidarity effort; (iii) private donations; and (iv) the mobilization of extern al financing. 8. Framework for Institutional Coordination It is proposed that a feasibility study be performed for a steering mechanism to guide the implementation of the SNPS. While awaiting the outcome of this evaluation, it is recommended that the c urrent steering committee be assigned these functions, drawing on support from: Implementation and support structures: sectoral ministries, civil society organizations, associations of ulamas and imams, the media, and technical and financial partners; A monitoring and evaluation and advocacy/communication mechanism; A social protection monitoring center; The National Assembly and the Senate; Regional and local administrative and community coordination structures. 9. Next Stages - Road Map A road map for the first year of the strategy's implementation is presented below: ACTIVITIES EXPECTED RESULTS COMMENTS Adoption of the SNPS and its widespread dissemination Strategy adopted and disseminated among all of the wilayas Request for monitoring on the part of the steering committee Creation of the coordination structure Coordination framework created and operational Structure based on the cross - cutting nature of social protection Elaboration of an annual action plan Action plan that identifies priority actions by pillar Work by group/pillar/ supporting measure Identification of emergency measures Specific emergency measures implemented Government/technical and financial partners consultation PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 59 Initiation of efforts to strengthen the database and targetin g Reflections and sharing of experience in this area Targeting of most vulnerable groups Structural organization and mobilization of partnerships (technical and financial partners, civil society) Partnerships mobilized Technical consultation bringing together national and international experts Estimation of financial needs and elaboration of a strategy for the mobilization of resources Social protection group created Strategy for the mobilization of resources launched Contacts with the Civil Society Organization (OSC) Africa platform for social protection would be useful. The guidelines proposed in the strategy should be developed further. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 60 In light of this situation, and in accordance with the directions of the PRSP III, the efforts by the Govern ment and its technical and financial partners are focused on the elaboration of a National Social Protection Strategy. This strategy is based on the principles of our religion, the national values of solidarity, the principles of fairness and social justic e, and the rights of citizens. It offers a vision and long -terms prospects for the gradual creation of a coherent, effective, and integrated system of social protection. Through the adoption of this strategy, Mauritania will be one of the first countries i n the subregion with a global, integrated, collaborative vision of social protection, which will make it possible to increase access to risk management tools and to social protection systems among the poorest and most vulnerable groups, but also among othe r at-risk social groups. The main objective is to strengthen social security and to promote labor and employment to benefit vulnerable persons through the following, in particular: (i) expanded health insurance coverage (National Health Insurance Fund (CN AM), National Social Security Fund (CNSS)); and (ii) improvement of the conditions and effective care for the poor. This main objective is reflected in a number of specific objectives for which activities are planned in 2012 -2015. In order to consolidate the gains that have been made in the area of social security and to extend coverage to populations not yet covered, the Government will carry out the following priority actions: (i) the performance of an actuarial study of the allocations provided through the CNSS with the aim of improving them; (ii) promotion of the registration of workers and the enforcement of regulatory documents in this area; (iii) the revision of regulatory documents pertaining to pension funds (for government officials and the privat e sector) with a view to providing for the transfer of pensions of deceased women to their dependents; (iv) the preparation of a study to serve as the basis for the drafting of a regulation on social security for vulnerable groups; (v) the performance of a feasibility study and the establishment of an unemployment benefit system; (vi) the performance of a feasibility study and the establishment of an old -age pension; (vii) the performance of a feasibility study and the establishment of a health insurance sy stem under the CNSS to serve persons not covered by other insurance plans. With the aim of creating opportunities for decent employment for the most vulnerable populations, the following actions will be carried out: (i) the strengthening and widespread di ssemination of legislative and regulatory texts aimed at ensuring access to productive labor for the most vulnerable segments of the population (disabled persons, women, etc.); (ii) the strengthening and decentralization of mechanisms for the training and mainstreaming of vulnerable persons (disabled persons, young people, women, agro - pastoral workers, etc.); (iii) the intensification and expansion of the number of specific programs for vulnerable groups with no income (income -generating activities, labor -intensive activities, and economic interest groups); (iv) institutional capacity building of socio -professional associations (artisans, livestock breeders, fishermen, women, etc.); (v) the establishment of a job market information system for vulnerable segm ents of the population; (vi) the enforcement of regulatory provisions concerning working conditions and payment for small jobs; and (vii) the development and expansion of access by vulnerable groups to microfinance and microbusiness. In the specific area of social assistance and the advancement of vulnerable persons , the overall objective is the intensification of actions through support for the policies and programs that are in place, in particular through the delivery of targeted services and appropriate benefits. In this area, the following actions are planned: (i) strengthening the enforcement of laws and international conventions; (ii) the preparation of advocacy efforts for inclusive education and the strengthening of specialized access st ructures; (iii) the inclusion of disabled persons and their families or caregivers in social cash transfer programs; (iv) support for communication and public awareness programs; (v) support for community groups; (vi) strengthening of the database of disab led persons through the relevant surveys; (vii) a feasibility study of the establishment of an old -age pension system; (viii) improved coordination in providing assistance to victims; (ix) creation of a victims' assistance fund; (x) support for processes involved in the reintegration of repatriated persons and for mechanisms to provide access to basic social services; (xi) implementation of the international Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; (xii) strengthening of measures to protect migrants p assing through Mauritania; (xiii) identification of the most appropriate social protection measures by making use of participatory planning processes; (xiv) enforcement of the 2007 law (and its implementing decrees); (xv) support for and strengthening of t he National Strategy to Eradicate the Legacy of Slavery; (xvi) the drafting, widespread dissemination, and application of a national guide on global care for people living with HIV; (xvii) the elaboration and implementation of a socio -economic support prog ram for people living with HIV; (xviii) improvement in the care of prisoners being held in penal institutions (nutrition, health, hygiene); and (xix) strengthening of social assistance for these persons, with a particular emphasis on women, minors, and dis advantaged persons. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 61 PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 62 PILLAR III: Development of Human Resources and Expansion of Basic Services To succeed in combating poverty, aspects related to the development of human resources and access to basic social services must be taken into account. The issue of access to an equitable service (basic education, basic healthcare, etc.) should be viewed in terms of the welfare provided by such access and the positive externalities created by the use of the service. Consequently, the completion of basic education is in and of itself a goal for the individual who receives that education, but also the best w ay to increase that individual's work productivity and improve his or her health and that of his or her family. A large part of the solution to many health problems lies outside the healthcare system itself. Improving child health, which is at the base of the healthcare pyramid, is determined in large part by the mother's level of education, the availability of safe drinking water, and the existence of an effective sanitation system. The delivery of high quality health services, however, depends on the avai lability of trained personnel and the presence of healthcare facilities supplied with water and electricity. Trained personnel will be available only if the education system is able to produce them, and the quality of the system's output depends, among o ther things, on the health and nutritional status of the population, the growth of demand for all basic services, and the legitimate hopes and aspirations of vulnerable groups in need of protection (women, young people, children living in difficult circums tances, indigents, etc.). The strong correlation between the individual and his or her environment is indicative of the major challenges inherent in the development of human resources and the expansion of basic services. Aware of the scope of these challe nges, the government focused on the development of the following basic, complementary, and interdependent sectors: (i) education; (ii) literacy and traditional education; (iii) technical and vocational training; (iv) health and nutrition; (v) water and san itation; (vi) employment; (vii) population policy; (viii) the empowerment of women and gender equality; (ix) childhood; (x) social protection; and (xi) universal access to basic services. Education In line with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), the primary objective in the area of basic education is to ensure that all Mauritanian children receive a complete, high -quality primary education. To attain that general objective, Mauritania is pursu ing the following specific objectives: (i) expand educational opportunities by reorganizing the education system (both public and private) to reflect the demand for boosting the student retention rate in basic education (to 79 percent by 2015); (ii) elimin ate gender disparities in all wilayas and between socioeconomic and residential environments; (iii) improve the quality of basic education; and (iv) improve the management of system oversight by adopting a results - oriented approach. The actions needed to attain these objectives are: The expansion of educational opportunities by reorganizing the education system to reflect the demand for boosting the student retention rate in basic education will involve the following actions: (i) build and rehabilitate cl assrooms; (ii) consolidate schools and set up school canteens; (iii) recruit teachers; and (iv) improve the school environment (desks, latrines, etc.). The effort to eliminate gender disparities in all wilayas and between socioeconomic and residential environments will include specific activities for inclusive education aimed at: (i) improving the access of vulnerable groups and reducing gender disparities; and (ii) offering Braille and sign language courses; instruction in the modes, means, and forms of c ommunication; and the development of mobility and orientational capacities. Improving the quality of basic education will involve raising the rate of attainment of the CEP (primary education certificate) to 57 percent of candidates by 2015. To that end, t he following measures will be adopted: (i) improvement of the level of teachers graduating from ENIs (initial training) and enhancement of the classroom skills of teachers (continuing education); (ii) improvement of the school environment (equipment, safe drinking water, latrines, surveillance...); (iii) the strengthening of local management; (iv) revision of the textbook policy; and (v) improvement of teaching strategies. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 63 Finally, results -oriented management and oversight of the sector will be based on a systemic, transparent view of the sector's resources obtained through: (i) better resource allocation aimed at the optimization of existing resources and transparency in th e management of assignments and careers; (ii) improvement of the sector's absorptive capacities by strengthening the planning function; (iii) effective establishment of the SIGE (Education Geography Information System); and (iv) the participation of partne rs (CSOs, APEs, unions) in the management of the education system. The objectives for secondary education are to: (i) improve and expand admission capacities; (ii) strengthen the quality of education by taking the employment aspect and the development of knowledge acquisition into account; and (iii) improve coordination and cooperation with the higher education sectors. The following actions will be taken to attain these objectives: (i) expansion of schools and/or renovation of existing classrooms; (ii) promotion of private education (target: 27 percent of secondary students by 2015) by adopting appropriate regulations and hiring qualified personnel with a view to achieving autonomy; (iii) recruitment of teachers capable of carrying out the reform; (iv) use of school districting maps; (v) promotion of the enrollment of girls to achieve boy -girl parity in secondary education; (vi) overhaul of initial teacher training and introduction of initial training for secondary school inspectors at the ENS to improve local management; (vii) increased use of experimentation in the teaching of scientific subjects; (viii) introduction of ICTs in the education system; (ix) establishment of an effective continuing education system; and (x) the creation of secondary schools of excellence.

Water and sanitation To deal with problems related to the lack of available water and the inadequacy of the sanitation system, the government's main objective is to improve sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation which is qualitatively and quantitatively sufficient and affordable for all. Moreover, in line with the MDG, Mauritania is committed to halving, by 2015, the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 66 Attainment of the overall objective will be pursued through the following specific objectives: (i) improve access to safe drinking water by ensuring, by 2015, that 74 percent of the population in rural and semi - urban areas has access to a source of safe drinking water; (ii) identify water resources; (iii) optimize the use of surface water; (iv) improve sanitation conditions by ensuring, by 2015, that 70 percent of ho useholds have access to an improved sanitation system; (v) promote public -private partnerships in the water sector; and (vi) strengthen the capacities of the various sectoral stakeholders. Efforts to improve access to water will focus on: (i) ensuring th e security of production and distribution (AEPs of Bogh\u00e9, M'Bout, and Tidjikja); (ii) rehabilitating the Nouakchott distribution system; (iii) increasing the production of the Diguenni, Kankossa, and N\u00e9ma centers; (iv) mastering drilling techniques and the procurement of material and equipment (Indian project); (v) creating open -air water retention basins; and (vi) constructing AEPs (Aleg AEP, inland AEP Echarghi, Maghta Lahjar, and Chegar.

The activities planned to expand knowledge of water resources will involve: (i) the promotion of integrated water resources managem ent (GIRE); (ii) encouragement of the conveyance of water resources from areas with surpluses to areas with shortages; (iii) the conduct of new general hydrogeological studies in various areas of the country; (iv) the mapping of water resources in each Wil aya at appropriate scales; (v) delineation of the protective and strategic safeguard boundaries of the well fields of major and secondary cities; and (vi) the conduct of a study on water and sanitation access indicators. Other activities will also be car ried out: delineation and mapping of aquifers (including exploratory drilling) Benichab, Boulenoir, the sheet sandstones of Aioun and Dhar de N\u00e9ma; deep groundwater prospecting by drilling 5 deep boreholes (more than 400 m) in the Agane, Adrar, and Tag ant regions; the national system for monitoring changes in water tables and surface water, including the acquisition and installation of monitoring systems for the southern Wilayas; regionalization of data by creating databases for eight Wilayas. The emph asis in terms of optimizing the use of surface water will be on: (i) constructing infrastructure to take full advantage of surface water resources (dams, retention basins, etc.); (ii) stepping up investment in the field of tapping surface water resources t o satisfy the demand of various users; (iii) training human resources in the control and treatment of surface water; and (iv) designing a database and a geographic information system (SIG) on surface water resources. In the rural and semi -urban environment, the creation of the National Office for Water Supply Services in Rural Areas (ONSER) will make it possible to improve water supply services, optimize resources, and put an end to the involvement of multiple operator s while at the same time guaranteeing greater public participation through water management committees. As for groundwater, 600 production boreholes will be drilled. Surface water initiatives will include the construction of 500 retention basins and reha bilitation of the Craa lemehrouda dam (Tintane). Sanitation conditions will be improved by: (i) implementation of the sanitation project in the city of Nouakchott; (ii) the installation of sanitation systems in the cities of Rosso and Nouadhibou; (iii) attainment of the goal of 2,100 \"latrinized\" villages; (iv) the building of 700 community latrines; and (v) the construction of sludge disposal stations in Nouadhibou and Kiffa. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 67 The main actions to promote public -private partnerships will focus on: (i) the perpetuation of existing investments; and (ii) the optimal management of water infrastructures. Finally, all these strategies and actions will be supported by a capacity -building pillar for stakeholders that will involve: (i) the expansion of water resou rces management (GIRE) in the Wilayas; (ii) the recruitment of qualified personnel to strengthen the decentralized services; (iii) the development of a long -term water sector strategy for the 2012 -2015 period; (iv) the conduct of thematic studies (regulati on of the water and sanitation sector, rate structures, sanitation code, the waste disposal sector, etc.); and (v) the strengthening of DRHAs.

PILLAR IV: Promoting good governance and capacity building In spite of the significant progress that has been made in this area, the promotion of good governance continues to be one of the main challenges facing Mauritania. The special attention that public authorities are supposed to be devoting to achieving the goal of good governance has already been established as part of the PRSP III. This effort wi ll involve the establishment of the most appropriate organizational, legal, economic, and political mechanisms to create a virtuous circle of social transformation in service of the nation. The objective of creating a modern public administration that is more effective and more efficient, in order to do a better job of serving the population, should be achieved through the strengthening of the institutional and organizational framework, through an improvement in the quality of public service, and through t he modernization of human resources management within the government. Economic governance will receive special attention with a view to achieving greater effectiveness, more transparency and equity, and eliminating corruption. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 69 The strengthening of democr acy will be supported by a new vision for action by the state based on a land - use management policy that will guarantee the country's more balanced and more harmonious development. Finally, in order to ensure that they have a lasting impact, these various measures will be backed up by the implementation of a good environmental governance policy with full participation, which will involve all of the stakeholders in citizen -based supervision of public actions. Democratic governance The Government's policy for 2012 -2015 with regard to democratic governance has the following objectives: (i) strengthening the justice system; (ii) consolidation of democracy; (iii) promotion of human rights; (iv) parliamentary capacity building; (v) consolidation of national uni ty; and (vi) combating insecurity and illegal migration.

PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 70 With regard to security and migration , and with the aim of coping with the threats related to drug trafficking, terr orism, cross -border crime, and illegal immigration, the actions initially outlined under the PRSP are still relevant. These include: (i) the implementation of a national migration strategy; (ii) strengthening of the resources and skills of the armed forces and security forces; and (iii) strengthening of cooperation at the regional and international levels. Territorial and local governance The Government's strategy in this area is centered around the following key elements: decentralization, devolution, and land -use management. With regard to decentralization and land -use management, the targeted objective is the transformation of the territorial landscape through a new institutional coupling and a balanced vision of territorial development inspired by the guidelines set forth in the PRSP III. The planned actions refer to the statement of the decentralization and local development policy adopted in April 2010, which focused on the following key el ements: (i) the reinforcement and consolidation of the institutional process of decentralization; (ii) the promotion of local development; (iii) financial capacity building of local authorities; (iv) expansion of the geographical scope of decentralization; and (v) greater mobilization and education of the public.

Environmental governance In the area of environmental governance, the strategic objectives are still pertinent. They consist of: (i) taking the environmental dimension into account in developm ent strategies and programs; (ii) strengthening environmental governance; and (iii) building national capacities for monitoring climate change. Consideration of the environmental dimension in development strategies and programs will be carried out through the following, among other actions: (i) developing the economic value of natural capital; (ii) soil restoration; (iii) integrated management of water resources, fishery resources, forests, and ecosystems, assigning particular importance to natural sites a nd wetlands; (iv) conservation of biodiversity; and (v) increased involvement of local stakeholders in the management of these resources.

In addition, the measures planned for the strengthening of the institutional and organizat ional framework and human resources should contribute to an improvement in the quality of public services. This improvement will be the result of a number of actions involving: (i) the drafting of a priority plan for the renovation and maintenance of admin istrative equipment and the adaptation of the equipment budget to the new investment needs; (ii) the simplification of administrative procedures and paperwork; (iii) widespread application and expansion of the mechanism for communication between the admini stration and its users (the creation of new operational welcome centers, information centers, and assistance centers for the public); (iv) the drafting of a public services charter; (v) the reorganization and digitization of administrative archives; and (v i) the institutionalization of the obligation to meet user demand and to provide the reasons for administrative actions. Finally, with regard to strengthening the use of information and communication technologies , which have a vital impact on the performa nce and quality of services provided by the administration, the emphasis will be on the continuation of efforts to integrate central administrative bodies within a broadband network so as to enable them to collaborate and make use of sectoral information s ystems that will be managed on a shared basis so as to reduce costs and to make up for the shortage of qualified personnel. Economic governance Economic governance will be provided for through better control of the planning and programming process, and t he development of the statistical tools and information systems. These measures will be supported by program budgeting and efficient and transparent management of public resources, and efforts to combat all forms of corruption and mismanagement. With rega rd to planning and programming , the recommended measures should allow for the following: (i) the continuation of work on the alignment of different economic and financial programming tools (PRSP, MTEF, PIP, and the Initial Budget Law (LFI)); (ii) the estab lishment of a system for monitoring the macroeconomic environment and capacity building in the area of modeling and elaboration of the MTEFs; (iii) the annual updating of the global MTEF; (iv) the basing of the budget law on the MTEF, as well as the presen tation of the budget following an approach that is consistent with a functional and economic PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 72 nomenclature; (v) capacity building among personnel in the area of macroeconomics and statistics; and (vi) the establishment of tools for the ongoing assessment of public policies.

The efforts aimed at im proving economic governance will be consolidated through the planning of key measures in the following areas: (i) the coordination of foreign aid; (ii) the management of state property; and (iii) the reorganization of publicly owned enterprises. As for th e coordination of foreign aid , the priority actions will be directed at: (i) the development of an integrated information system for foreign aid; and (ii) the dissemination of reports concerning this aid and, in accordance with the spirit of the Paris Decl aration on Aid Effectiveness, the establishment of more effective mechanisms for coordinated management of programs and projects with technical and financial partners, while promoting better alignment and harmonization with partners and gradual movement to ward budget assistance to replace projects that have certain counterproductive effects on the public authorities, which are becoming increasingly evident. With respect to the management of state property , the proposed measures are: (i) the removal of constraints that are hindering the establishment of the accrual -based accounting that was initiated in recent years; (ii) capacity building of the Land Office General Directorate through the establishment of a land information system, or a national land re gister; (iii) performance of operations involving the recovery/development of public land, in particular land in the city of Nouakchott; (iv) development of the Bay of Nouadhibou; and (v) the performance of land inventory operations and the demarcation of public land in regional capitals.

As for publi c oversight of government actions , the Mauritanian Government has set as a priority for the coming years the strengthening and promotion of an organized civil society that is fully cognizant of its responsibilities with respect to governance. Major efforts will be undertaken by the media and nongovernmental organizations to promote real citizen oversight at all levels of public life. In the area of communication , in addition to the liberalization of the audiovisual sector, the selected actions will be focused on: (i) the deepening of reforms already undertaken; (ii) the elaboration and implementation of a communication strategy; (iii) the elaboration of a media development strategy; and (iv) institutional, human, and technical capacity building among th e various participants in the press and communication sector. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 73 With regard to the Government -Donors -Private Sector -Civil Society consultation process, the objective is to establish a genuine, ongoing dialogue among all of the stakeholders, which will go be yond the PRSP formulation process and implementation monitoring, and will address the entire range of issues related to the country's economic and social development. As for civil society organizations , the measures aimed at optimization of their action p lan and capacity building involve: (i) the performance of mapping independently of the civil society organizations, led by a committee that is made up of representatives of civil society and the Government and that is open to observation on the part of tec hnical and financial partners; (ii) the establishment of a National Civil Society Capacity Building Fund (FNRC/SC); (iii) the creation of a structure called \"Dar el Moujtama Elmedeni\" (the Civil Society Center), equipped with an operational documentation c enter; (iv) the elaboration of a mechanism for monitoring the activities of international NGOs, which also requires an association with local partners for activities on the ground; (v) facilitation of access to bank loans and to microfinance institutions for small civil society organizations; and (vi) a study on the establishment of an independent civil society monitoring center. PILLAR V: Enhanced steering, monitoring, evaluation, and coordination of the PRSP The operationalization of the PRSP III monitori ng and evaluation system is a priority for the Government and an imperative for the consolidation of the sectoral programming tools with the strategic directions. The principal objectives identified in this area are still relevant. They include: (i) the op erationalization of the existing institutional mechanism; (ii) the establishment of an effective monitoring and evaluation system and regular reporting tools; (iii) the design and implementation of mechanisms that provide for better coordination of partici pation by all of the stakeholders in poverty reduction efforts (the Government, elected officials, civil society, the private sector, development partners); (iv) the operationalization of the PRSP process; and (v) the elaboration and implementation of an i ntegrated communication strategy for development policy. The institutional mechanism for monitoring the implementation of the PRSP III During the 2012 -2015 period, the steering and consultation process related to monitoring the implementation of the PRS P III will continue to be based on a mechanism that is organized around three entities: the Interministerial Poverty Reduction Committee, the Consultation Committee on Poverty Reduction, and the Donors' Committee. The system should continue the logic alre ady defined in the current PRSP monitoring and evaluation mechanism, while seeking to make it operational and more effective. The number of technical sectoral committees should be reduced to just one per ministry. Their composition should be limited to the principal sectoral stakeholders. The institutional mechanism of the PRSP II will be simplified by relying more on operational monitoring structures at the sectoral level. The priority will be to provide for more systematic circulation of information among the various stakeholders and to harmonize the reporting tools. The new PRSP Monitoring and Evaluation Department will play a central role in coordinating the activities of the technical sectoral committees, in consolidating their sectoral contributions, and in communicating them to the various structures concerned, in particular the Technical Committee on Poverty Reduction. The institutional structure for guiding the PRSP III monitoring and evaluation process should create capacities for the ongoing mob ilization of sectoral stakeholders whose hierarchical position will enable them to provide a range of information that is often scattered throughout the various services and projects of ministries. The monitoring and evaluation system and regular reportin g tools The PRSP III monitoring system is centered around the following components: (i) a global steering scorecard (progress in implementation of the PRSP is summarized by a number of indicators, EPCV, Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), etc.), w hich is administered by the MAED and based on data from sectoral scorecards; (ii) sectoral scorecards prepared on a quarterly and annual basis, which allow for the monitoring of various aspects of the PRSP; (iii) three general reporting tools, including a quarterly executive summary, a semi -annual report, and an annual review report; and (iv) an information system that supports the rest of the other components. PRSP III Implementation Status Report Year 2011 74 The management of the scorecards should be facilitated by the creation of a software application that allows for a substantial reduction in the time required for the updating of data and for the harmonization of reporting tools. The information system for the monitoring and evaluation of the strategy will continue to be centered around three compone nts: (i) \"monitoring of household living conditions\"; (ii) \"program project monitoring\"; and (iii) \"impact assessment.\" These different subsystems will be based on a matrix of indicators that meets the needs of PRSP monitoring and evaluation, without running the risk of having indicators that are not available. Given that the various areas of the PRSP are not all covered by a performance or implementation indicator, the matrix should be scalable. Coordination The Government will pursue the PRSP III coordination objectives together with both the sectoral stakeholders and technical and financial partners. The operationalization of the mechanism should be based on the assignment of more responsibility to the technical ministries for implementation monit oring. This responsibility is necessary in order to provide for better ownership of the PRSP approach on the part of the various stakeholders and to strengthen the relationship between the PRSP coordination structure and the sectoral departments. Within the context of the alignment and harmonization of foreign aid, the Government will continue the efforts undertaken as part of the implementation of the Paris Declaration through the following actions, in particular: (i) the implementation of a national act ion plan for the implementation of the Paris Declaration; (ii) the elaboration of a master plan for public finance reform; (iii) the implementation of reforms that should enable the country to become eligible for budget support that will eventually replace the project approach; (iv) alignment of all of the programming tools (PRSP, MTEF, PIP, LFI); and (v) coordination with technical and financial partners, which will be carried out through periodic meetings (semi -annual monitoring meetings, a consultative g roup, roundtables, etc.). With regard to the streamlining of mechanisms , the following actions will be undertaken: (i) an analysis of the weaknesses of the current mechanism; (ii) capitalization on successful experiences in this area in other countries; ( iii) the organization of a consultation process that brings together all of the stakeholders; and (iv) the drafting and adoption of a framework law on monitoring and evaluation in Mauritania. Finally, in order to improve the quality of the data produced, the National Statistical Office will provide for the production and broad dissemination of the figures needed for the monitoring and evaluation of the poverty reduction strategy, making use of the appropriate media. During the 2012 -2015 period, the Nationa l Statistical Office will lead the implementation of the following actions: (i) nutritional surveys (two per year); (ii) annual surveys of enterprises in the formal sector; (iii) annual survey of food security; and (iv) ex-ante and ex -post surveys for the evaluation of public programs. Operationalization of the PRSP The operationalization of the PRSP will be carried out at the regional level through the monitoring and implementation of Regional Poverty Reduction Programs (RPRPs). The Regional Economic and Social Development Committee s (CRDES), in addition to steering, direction, validation, and allocation and mobilization of development funds, are responsible for monitoring the implementation of the PRSP at the regional level. Finally, at the national leve l, this operationalization will be sought through the revision of sectoral and thematic reports and their adaptation to the priorities and ultimate choices of the PRSP. This revision will take into account the integration of the monitoring and evaluation s ystem and the reporting tools, as well as the constraints of the MTEF. ANNEX 1.
