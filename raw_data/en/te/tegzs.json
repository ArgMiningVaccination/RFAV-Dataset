Guests will need to provide proof of vaccination before embarkation and must have received both doses of the vaccine, if recommended by the manufacturer, the line said in a statement. The move follows similar announcements by [Saga](https://www.cruisetradenews.com/saga-to-insist-on-covid-19-vaccine-before-cruise-travel/) and [American Queen Steamboat Company and Victory Cruise Lines, ](https://www.cruisetradenews.com/aqsc-victory-cruise-lines-vaccine-to-board-ships/)while [Swan Hellenic has introduced valid Covid-19 vaccination](https://www.cruisetradenews.com/swan-hellenic-requirement-crew-covid-vaccine/) as a pre-embarkation requirement for all staff and crew. Crystal's requirement is part of its Crystal Clean+ 4.0 concept, which includes negative Covid-19 tests for guests and crew, temperature checks at the terminal prior to boarding, social distancing guidelines, enhanced cleaning and disinfection measures, reduced capacity and more. The line has paused operations until May for its river fleet, to June for its ocean ships, until 1 August for Crystal Esprit, and August for Crystal Endeavor. This will give most travellers \"sufficient time to get fully vaccinated before Crystal's resumption of sailing\", the line said. Crystal Cruises interim president and CEO Jack Anderson said: \"We are encouraged by the progress being made with the Covid-19 vaccines and what this means for our Crystal family and the travel industry as a whole as we eagerly look forward to exploring the world again. \"We know that peace of mind is the greatest luxury, and the vaccine requirement is simply the best way to ensure the safest possible Crystal experience for all on board. \"As part of the company's Crystal Clean+ 4.0 measures, crew members will be tested for Covid-19 prior to leaving their home location to join the ship and must receive a negative result. \"They also will take a Covid-19 test at embarkation, quarantine for seven days upon arrival, be tested again at the end of that seven-day period and must receive a negative result before beginning their duties. \"When vaccines are widely available, they will be a requirement of employment for crew, which must be completed at least 14 days prior "}
