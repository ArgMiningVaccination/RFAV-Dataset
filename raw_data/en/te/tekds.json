An ardent naturalist, Nunez had found ed the Cuban Speleological Society at the age of 17 and earned a Doctorate in Arts and Philosophy at the University of Havana in 1951. He would go on with Guevara's column to Havana, manage the Agrarian Reform Program, found the Cuban Academy of Sciences, set aside nature preserves, direct research institutes, write environmental respon - sibilities into the Cuban Constitution, found a non -governmental organization on the proceeds from his publications, and end his career organizing protests for cleanup and environmental reform. 2 Environmental law in Cuba rises from these roots: a long history of land abuse, 3 successive waves of revolution, 4 and a late -day awakening led by the scientific community, no less sudden in its appearance than the awakening of the United States a few decades before. After centuries of neglect, environmental policy is now on a fast track in Cuba. The instruments of this policy, in turn, are sowing seeds of law that could have major impacts on Cuban governance. This article describ es the evolution of Cuban environmental law. To begin, it hazards a summary of the machinery of government. It then moves to consider early environmental laws and policies, the emergence of a new environmental ministry in 1994, a new frame - work environme ntal law in 1997, subsequent programs for environ - mental impact assessment, coastal zone management, and biological diversity, and first steps towards their implementation. It ends with an assessment of special economic, political and legal challenges Cuba faces and their relationship to environmental policy. The questions are obvious. The answers are not, but their pursuit is very much in play. ________________________________ ________________________ 2.

A V IEW OF THE PROBLEM All these islands are very beautiful, and distinguished by various qualities; they are accessible, and full of a great variety of trees stretching up to the stars; the leaves of which I believe are never shed, for I saw them as green and flourishing as they are usually in Spain in the month of May; some of them were blossoming; some wer e bearing fruit, some were in other conditions; each one was thriving in its own way. The nightingale and various other birds without number were singing, in the month of November, when I was exploring them. There are besides in the said island of Juana seven or eight kinds of palm trees, which far excel ours in height and beauty, just as all the other trees, herbs and fruits do. 5 Letter of Christopher Columbus concerning the islands recently discovered in the Indian sea, 1492 The trees were the first thing that Europeans saw when they came to America. Europe held barely a dozen tree species. 6 The New World held more than one hundred, including the tallest, oldest, and most extensive stocks on any continent. 7 For Christopher Columbus entering the C aribbean, the contrast with arid, war -torn Spain \u2014 beaten to the ground over centuries for fire - wood and cattle \u2014 must have been intense. In his accounts, Columbus would describe the trees he saw before describing the native peoples, the geography, or eve n the prospects for gold that drove his expedition, and those that followed, towards one of the most lucrative and brutal conquests in the history of the world. Of all the sites Columbus visited, the most impressive was the island of \"Juana,\" which he cal led \"the most beautiful land human eyes have ever seen.\" 8 It was covered by trees. There were no snakes of any ________________________________ ________________________ 5. Christopher Columbus, The Letters Of Columbus On The Discovery Of America 3 -4 (photo. reprint 1842) (n.d.)

It would take longer for the trees. Cuba was initially spared the conquest by the simple fact that it had little gold. When Spain hit the jackpot in Mexico, then in Peru, Cuba became a staging area for ships and, lat er, slaves to clear the trees and raise tobacco, indigo, and the crop that would transform its environment and determine its future: sugar. 10 Some ninety -five percent of Cuba was under forest in 1492. 11 The woods were originally maintained, and indeed hus banded by decree, to supply the Spanish fleet. 12 With the arrival of British slavers in the 1760's however, and the rising appetite in their North American colonies for sugar and rum (John Adams would write: \"I know not why we should blush to confess it, but molasses was an essential ingredient in American independence\"), 13 Cuba experienced the same slash - and-burn conversion to slave agriculture seen in the American South. By the late 1800's, it was producing one fourth of the world's sugar. 14 The sugar an d slave trades would dominate Cuba's relationship with Spain and then the United States. By 1956, the U.S. owned forty percent of Cuban sugar production, a quarter of all bank deposits, one half of the railroads, and ninety percent of all electric and telephone service. 15 The City of Havana and a few Cuban beaches were American playgrounds but, beyond these enclaves, the country had been transformed. A landscape nearly totally forested at the time of Columbus \u2014 and dependent on that cover for its sustaina bility \u2014 was down to fifty percent cover by 1900, and by the 1950's to fourteen percent in fringes of mangroves and mountain ________________________________ ________________________ 9.

With infrastructures in transportation, drinking water, and se wage treatment in disrepair; 18 rudimentary -at- best industrial treatment; 19 urban housing literally falling down; 20 an economy crippled by the loss of subsidies and markets in the Eastern Bloc and harried by a United States embargo; 21 a government still groping to reconcile state control with economic development; 22 and only limited traditions of administrative process, public participation and judicial review, 23 environmental solutions in Cuba could appear to be all but unattainable, and certainly not a priority for the government or its people. Havana Harbor looks bad, smells bad, and has been identified by the United Nations as one of the ten most polluted bays in the world. 24 The Almendares River, flowing through Havana in the 1840's as \"a bluish river that sl ides by like a sheet of glass,\" was described recently and more bluntly by a Cuban environmental leader as \"a river full of shit.\" 25 And yet, Cuba is changing.

[Vol. 16.1 there are laws \u2014 new and potentially very powerful environmental laws. As unusual as it may seem, and as difficult as it might be to accept, Cuba has made environmental protection a prio rity goal and is taking large steps government -wide to bring it about. In this effort, and against all of the handicaps noted above and more, it has several assets of considerable value. The first asset is the extraordinary nature of its biological resources. Scattered across the landscape in relic pockets, keys, caves, marshes, wet forests, and mountain ravines are nearly 7000 species of plants \u2014 half of all identified plant species of the Caribbean, more than a third of the number of plant species kn own to the United States and Canada combined. 29 The diversity of fauna is no less impressive, with twelve times as many mammal species per hectare as the United States and Canada, twenty -nine times the amphibians and reptiles, and thirty -nine times the num ber of bird species including several endangered species, the rare Bee Hummingbird, and the last known sighting of the Ivory -Billed Woodpecker, now extinct in the United States. 30 From the standpoint of biological diversity, research, and beneficial deriva tives, Cuba is as important as any nation in the Northern hemisphere, facts of which Cubans are quite aware. Cuba's biotechnology industry has been producing biological pharmaceuticals and pest controls since the early 1980s. 31 No less important are Cuba' s coastal resources, with nearly 4, 000 miles of shoreline on the main island and an additional 4,195 out - lying, mostly uninhabited coastal islets and keys. 32 Cuban beaches have the rare advantages of being both abundant and relatively unspoiled by Caribbe an, or even Florida, standards. They have become a major draw for international tourism, on which much of the country's economic future now depends, 33 facts of which Cubans ________________________________ ________________________ plantations\" managed for sustained -yield wood production.

Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 7 are also quite aware. By 1996, tourism had replaced agriculture as Cuba's primary source of revenue. 34 A second asset is Cuba's depth in science and education. Cuba's science traditions extend back nearly two centuries to the German naturalist and geographer Alexander Von Humbolt, whose works of exploration and classification remain be nchmarks in the field. 35 At the turn of the 1900's, Cuban and U.S. scientists began extensive surveys of Cuba's biological resources, forming the backbone of collections in the New York Botanical Garden, the City of Philadelphia and the Aggaziz Museum of Ha rvard University. 36 Harvard's Botanical Field Station at Cienfuegos contained the largest living collection of tropical plants in the western hemisphere, and was a leading educational center for U.S. students in tropical bi - ology. 37 The University of Havan a has trained natural scientists from Caribbean and Latin American countries for more than one hundred years, 38 and between 1980 to 1984 graduated more than 95,000 professionals in science and technology at the university level. 39 More than a dozen academie s and institutes hold high rank in Cuban government and support nearly 30,000 employees and 214 research and field units across the country. 40 Cuban education stresses the sciences, and the education is extensive, with one of the highest literacy rates in the world. 41 It was this science cadre that would lay the foundation for the environmental movement to come. Indeed, Cuban scientists would lead it, and go on to head the agencies responsible for carrying it forward. The Cuban environmental movement's th ird asset \u2014 although without doubt its most controversial one \u2014 is the open support it has received from the highest level of Cuban government, President Fidel Castro. In any nation, the support of the Chief Executive is a sine qua non of environmental pr ogress without which, as United States experience shows, even with the best of laws and most active ________________________________ ________________________ 34.

[Vol. 16.1 of citizenry, the programs fall into stalemate. 42 Nowhere, however, may this support be more critical than in a centrist regime such as that of Cuba. The f act is, therefore, that while Cuba retained important biological resources following the Spanish and Sugar holo - causts, and while a strong cadre of scientists was on hand to promote their conservation, environmental protection in post -revolutionary Cuba wa s on the same road to nowhere seen in many countries until the 1990's. 43 Then, suddenly, environmental protection was cata - pulted forward by the Cuban President, largely in response to the Rio Conference on the Environment and Development of 1992. At issue is the extent to which it will become its own institution. II. INSTITUTIONS AND THE LAW [A] revolution consists in the first phase in the destruction of the unjust laws of the old society; there is no doubt that our revolution has been a destroyer of laws. More just laws, the new juridical order of the new society, that is what we are trying to create now. 44 Fidel Castro, 1963 Legislation is an essential element of any environ - mental strategy. To actually play such role, the environmental legislation has to be both efficient and effective. It comprises the Framework Law and the rest of the legal regulations geared at protecting the environment, including technical norms of environmental protection. 45 CITMA, 1997 ________________________________ ________________________ 42.

Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 9 Cuba is having to reconcile itself w ith a system of public law, and environmental law, as in many countries, is pushing the envelope. A primary purpose of the Cuban revolution was to dismantle both laws and systems viewed as anti -social and unjust. Among the first targets were private prop erty and the practice of law, which were seen as working in concert to protect privilege and the old order. In moves that would warm the hearts of \"tort reformers\" and critics of the American legal system today, private lawyers were con - sidered \"parasites ,\" law practice was nationalized, law school enrollments plummeted, and practitioners moved on to become agency legal advisors, to other fields, 46 or to Miami, Florida. At the same time, the government moved towards the redistribution of lands and the intr oduction of a planned economy, which required another kind of state. By 1975, Cuba had jelled a new governmental structure. 47 An elected National Assembly of Popular Power would exercise leg - islative power, assisted by provincial and municipal assemblies. 48 In keeping with the theory of popular power, the National Assembly would be the ultimate decision -maker not only for full -bore laws (Leyes), but for determinations of their constitutionality. 49 Between meetings of the National Assembly, a Council of Sta te elected from the Assembly would exercise legislative power, including inter - pretative power, with the authority to enact Decree Laws (Decreto - Leyes) \u2014 full laws in all respects, but subject to review and modification by the National Assembly. 50 The exec utive would consist of the Council of Ministers, the heads of more than twenty agencies, and within which the Executive Committee of the Council would direct and coordinate the operation of government. 51 The Council had the authority to adopt Decrees (Decr etos), with the authority to bind all executive agencies, but with an ill -defined reach short of law. The agencies themselves, or Ministries, were em - powered to adopt Regulations (Resoluciones, Instruciones) implementing their programs and governing thei r own affairs. 52 Thus, each primary branch \u2014 legislative and executive \u2014 would ________________________________ ________________________ 46.

The more important the decision, the farther up the chain its approval would go. T he new environmental law of Cuba, for example, would go to the top, the National Assembly, for enactment as a full law. 53 Alongside these governmental structures are two remaining powers, the judicial system and the Communist Party, neither of whose full i nfluence on an environmental policy is easy to assess. In concept, both the judiciary and the Justice Department are subordinate to the assemblies of popular power. 54 The court system tracks the three levels of government: local; provincial; and national \u2014 with the Supreme Court having appellate review of all lower de - cisions. 55 Judges are elected by their respective assemblies for fixed terms, and in the exercise of \"their function of imparting justice are independent and owe obedience only to the law.\" 56 As noted above, however, this independence \u2014 which apparently is independence in more than name 57 \u2014 does not extend to reviewing the constitutionality of laws or regulations. The extent to which it includes the review of the legality of government acts, s uch as environmental impact statements or permits, is a question with no tradition for an answer, 58 and one that, as discussed later in this article, will surely be pressed by the emerging environmental law. In 1991, the Council of State established econom ic chambers of the Supreme Court and provincial courts with jurisdiction over in - vestment and related environmental disputes. 59 During this same ________________________________ ________________________ 53. The legislative proce ss for environmental law is at least to some extent representative and participatory. See Bethell , supra note 4, at 134 (\"The National Assembly featured freer and somewhat influential debates on issues other than macro -economic policy or foreign and milita ry policy.

E VENSON , supra note 44, at 75 (judiciary), 81 (fiscal). In 1997, the judiciary which had be en subordinate to the Justice Department was made autonomous and independent in its supervision, administration and budget.

In the opinion of one Cuban jurist, these economic chambers have jurisdiction over economic and environmental disputes between economic entities (i.e., joint ventures and foreign corporations), but not over environmental disputes between citizens or corporations and the Cuban government. See e- mail from Lic. Vivian Hernandez, Cuban Ministry of J ustice (Aug. 16, 2000) (on file with Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 11 decade, the regulation of private law practice relaxed at least to the point that it was administered by an aut onomous, self -governing in - stitution financed by attorney fees. 60 The argument for this autonomy was that government control would compromise the representation of private clients in disputes with the government itself, 61 as would, of course, environmental disputes. Parallel to the judiciary, and subordinate as well to the National Assembly, is the Ministry of Justice (Fiscal) which operates, like the judiciary, at the national, provincial and local levels. 62 As in the United States, the Fiscal is respons ible for the enforcement of law against both public and private actions; it is also responsible for pro - posing laws and regulations regarding criminal and administrative sanctions. 63 These responsibilities, too, would be newly activated by the arrival of c omplex, administrative environmental law. The role and power of the Communist Party is, of course, the wild card in any discussion of Cuban institutions. Although its powers are not spelled out in the Constitution, the Party is described as the \"superior leading force\" 64 of the state and, while it does not have legislative authority, a leading commentator states it is \"in - conceivable\" that legislation would be adopted without Party approval. 65 It is the only lawful political party, and it plays a dominant role in the selection of candidates for the assemblies. 66 Some ninety percent of assembly delegates are Party members, 67 as are all or nearly all high government officials. 68 While the power of the Party is therefore indisputable, the role it plays and will play in environmental decision -making is less certain, or at least less visible. On the one hand, the Party's open en - dorsement of environmental protection and sustainable growth provides significant legitimacy to environmental programs.

A hotly -disputed question of road and bridge access to outlying keys for the development of tourism \u2014 areas prized and de - fended by ecologists at oceanic and science institutes 71 \u2014 was referred to the Cuban Vice President, the Secretary General of the Council of Ministers and a high Party official. 72 The bridge dispute was resolved by requiring the use of \"ecological bridges,\" structures that would allow for the free flow of water and aquatic organisms, but would obviously also facilitate the development of the keys. 73 In the end, the decision was political, as o f course it would have been in the United States. In the case of Cuba, the political arbiter is the Party. To this wild card must be added another uniquely Cuban dimension, the mass organizations of popular power.

Cuba's first steps in conservation, as in the United States, were to set aside areas for parks and forests and then to address the abuse of the land. 81 Roughly fifty years behind the timetable of the United States, Cuba declared its first national park in 1930, followed in succeeding years by the designation of other scattered refuges and natural areas. 82 Designations for the most part only in name, they were strength ened by one of the early acts of the revolutionary government in 1959, the Law of Agrarian Reform. One chapter, entitled \"On the Conservation of Forests and Soils,\" placed these newly created reserves under management regimes. 83 The well - known Zapata Swam p on Cuba's southern coast was one of the first new additions, and the beginning of a long and successful program to restore the Cuban Crocodile, at the time believed to be extinct. 84 Youth conservation brigades took to the field; projects of reforesta - tion began. 85 The first Communist Party Congress in 1975 identified the need to create an agency to attend to environmental problems, 86 and in 1976 the first Constitution declared that: To assure the well being of its citizens, the state and the society will protect nature. It is incumbent on the responsible agencies and on each citizen as well to see that the waters and air are maintained in a clean condition and that the soil, flora and fauna are pro - tected. 87 Cuba then followed a familiar -looking bureaucra tic path towards this goal.

In 1990, Cuba made one more try at collective management in Decree -Law 118, allocating specific environmental responsibilities among more than eight separate M inistries and authorizing a ninth, a new Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment (CITMA) to replace COMARNA. 93 In time, CITMA would take over the game. Events of the 1990's were precipitated by a number of factors, none the least of which wa s a recognition of the need for a single agency in charge. Environmental problems, particularly in Havana, were becoming more obvious and more acute. The crash of the Soviet Union and the ensuing economic crises in Cuba \u2014 as severe an economic shock as h as been experienced by any modern country short of war 94 \u2014 led to several economic and political changes with potentially significant environmental consequences.

Cuba had long been an active player in international environ - mental agreements, 97 engagement that could have been seen by skeptics as attempts to snatch the spotlight without risking serious economic consequences. Wha tever the merits of this skepticism, Rio was different both for the level of commitment expressed by the Cuban President 98 and for the effect, in turn, that Rio appears to have had on him and on Cuba. In a speech to the Rio conference, Fidel Castro found h is theme: If we want to save humanity from destroying itself, we have to distribute more equitably the riches and the available technologies on this planet. Less luxury and pilfering from a few countries for less poverty and hunger for the rest of the ea rth. No more transfer to the Third World of lifestyles and habits of consumer - ism that ruin the environment. Make human living more rational. Apply international economic order that is just. Use all the science necessary for sustainable development, wi thout pollution. Pay the environmental debt, not the foreign debt. Eliminate hunger, and not humankind. 99 Before the year was out, the Cuban Constitution was amended to read: The State protects the environment and the natural resources of the country. It recognizes their close link with the sustainable economic and social development for making human life more sensible, and for ensuring the survival, welfare, and security of present and future generations. It corresponds to the competent organs to imp lement this policy.

One at least rhetorical difference, in the view of Cuban legal scholars, is t he role of constitutional law in Cuban socialism. 104 Distinct from the conservative approach of classic civil law jurisdictions, the Cuban constitution is said to be proactive, striving to create a new citizen and now a new environmental citizen; 105 in theory , the words mean more. Of course, the same was said of the many guarantees, largely hollow, of the constitution of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, post -revolutionary Cuban law promoted public and collective values from the start. 106 Environmental val ues fit easily into this framework, 107 as did Law 33 in 1981 stating as its goal a society, in contrast with capitalist regimes, \"where the good of man is paramount, and where the social character of property facilitates environmental protection and the rati onal use of natural resources.\" 108 In fact, one of the more hyperbolic criticisms of ________________________________ ________________________ 100.

It must hav e struck a chord. Castro embraced this environmental revolution, brought it home, and put it in the new constitution, unleashing a chain reaction that is still running its course. IV. T HE AGENCY , THE STRATEGY AND LAW 81 While the majority welcomed the Law with pleasure and goodwill, I must also necessarily mention a minority view, which argued, more or less openly, that the Law was not constructed to fit our particular situation. The conceptual core of this line of thought was that the Law might well obst ruct development by establishing such demanding standards for a country beleaguered by so many difficulties. ... One proponent of this position commented that 'environmental protection is a game for the rich; our priority now is development, and later we wil l see.' 110 Orlando Rey Santos, CITMA, 1999 Cuba is no democracy in the western sense of the word, 111 but neither is it a monolith, a point illustrated by the development of Cuba's environmental law and policies in the 1990's. The tug -of-war among resource agencies and their constituencies over environ - mental policies and the substantive provisions that would carry them out, mirrored those seen daily in Washington, D.C., Brussels, and other capitals.

Ten years later, just where some ultimate powers bottom out has yet to be resolved. It is clear, however, that through the emergence of environmental law, the furniture of government has been rearranged. A. CITMA As one might expect with a planned state \u2014 and in significant contrast with the United States which responded to the need for en - vironmental law on a largely ad hoc and piecem eal basis \u2014 Cuba came back from Rio and, with assistance from the United Nations and other international agencies, engaged in a comprehensive study to diagnose its problems, shortfalls, and \"to -do's.\" 112 First among them was the creation of the long -awaited agency -in-charge. In 1994, Cuba consolidated many of the functions of the defunct COMARNA and of more than a dozen separate environmental in - stitutes and centers into one central authority, the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment (CITMA). 113 The new kid on the block, CITMA would be put into a roomful \u2014 more than twenty 114 \u2014 existing ministries. Many, such as the Ministry of Fisheries, had their own long -held turf; others, such as the Ministry of Sugar, had equally long -held power over specif ic activities that presented huge environmental problems. Add to this Tourism and Foreign Investment on whom Cuba's economic future would depend, the Ministry of Economy and Planning with nationwide zoning authority, and the inevitable OMB -like Ministry of Finance and Taxation, and it becomes clear that CITMA was playing with \"big boys.\" While the environment was only one of CITMA's articulated missions, it was its dominant one and the one that would test its effectiveness. CITMA was not left entire ly to its own devices. The organic decree setting out its mandate and authority directed the agency to \"steer and control the implementation\" of environmental policy, the rational use of natural resources, and sustainable development \u2014 once again, code wo rds from Rio. 115 It further directed the agency to \"draw up and control the implementation\" of regulatory programs, ________________________________ ________________________ 112.

Going one step further, in language of authority often exercised in the United States by the Department of Justice and the Of fice of Management and Budget, CITMA was authorized to \"settle the disagreements\" among agencies over environmental issues by \"making the relevant decisions\" or passing them on to higher authority, such as the Council of Ministers. 117 On paper, this new agency looked as if it would be able to have its say. Internally, CITMA organized its environmental responsibilities under a Deputy Minister for the Environment, and into two primary institutions. 118 The first was an Environmental Agency similar to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, with several scientific institutes and a center for natural areas (which in the United States fall under the Departments of Interior, Commerce and other agencies). At the core was a Center for Environmental Regulation and Inspection where the regulatory and enforcement power would lie. At the same time, CITMA created an Environmental Policy Directorate to develop future initiatives, similar to the U.S. Council on Environmental Quality. This small cadre of people, no more than a dozen and only one of whom was an attorney, would have an enormous effect in drafting, negotiating, enacting, and implementing the program to come. ________________________________ ________________________ 116.

Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 21 B. The National Environmental Strategy [T]here have been mistakes and shortcomings, due mainly to insufficient environmental awareness, knowledge and education, the lack of a higher management demand, limited introduction and generalization of scientific and technological achievements, the still insufficient incorporation of the environmental dimension in the policies, development plans and programs and the absence of a sufficiently integrative and coherent juridical system. 119 CITMA, 1997 The next step was to articulate a set of environmental goals, to which the government through its various ministri es would subscribe, and a process for carrying out its new \"supervisory\" re - sponsibilities. The vehicle was a National Environmental Strategy, the development of which had been perking along with United Nations (U.N.) assistance since the early 1990's. C ITMA's Policy Directorate personnel had taken a lead role in these initiatives; its attorney, through the U.N. and other institutions, had published several articles that contained the seeds of the Strategy and, ul - timately, the new Law. 120 Formally adopted in 1997, the Strategy had gone through an elaborate process of inter -agency negotiation with other ministries and institutes. 121 A consciously aspirational document, it did two important things: it made the case for environmental protection, and initiated a continuing process of review. The case was compelling and statistical. Category by category, in a fashion reminiscent of the early United States Council of Environ - mental Quality reports, 122 the data on soil degradation, water supply, waste treatment, d eforestation, and so forth were presented with easy -to-assimilate graphs and charts. 123 The Strategy went on to propose a generalized list of solutions, as might be expected from ________________________________ ________________________ 119.

CITM A had set the stage. As important as its data and recommendations, the Strategy also initiated an ongoing process of implementing strategies in which CITMA continues to play a lead role. Following the adoption of the National Strategy, CITMA personnel me t with other ministries to help draft, approve, and begin the execution of subsequent \"daughter strategies\" for all government agencies. 126 These latter strategies became game plans for achieving much more specific en - vironmental goals, some even as specifi c as the adoption of particular control processes at a particular facility, 127 and with time - tables to match. At the same time, CITMA began to work with provisional and local governments on their own environmental strategies, expected to play a larger role in an anticipated, less - centralized Cuban government. 128 Essentially jawboning \u2014 and it could be said that nearly all environmental law, however expressed, is based on jawboning \u2014 the process of developing and regularly reviewing these strategies gave CITMA access to, and at least a say in, every part of Cuban government. Related to these strategies and of perhaps equal importance is the participation by CITMA personnel with other agencies in the development of the Cuban Annual Plan, a process and a documen t similar to the United States Budget, and with an equally explicit statement of government activities and goals. 129 If things usually come down to money, in cash -short Cuba the allocation of scarce resources is an even more pivotal issue. The combination of CITMA participation in the articulation of agency objectives (through the strategies) and in their funding (through the budget process) results in a continuing process of heel -nipping and persuasion towards environmental goals. ________________________________ ________________________ 124.

Law 81, the Law of the Environment Whereas: It is necessary to update the legal principles, objectives and basic concepts of Cu ba's environmental policy, institutional framework and the tools for their implementation, the powers, functions and duties of the state agencies and bodies and, in general, the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons. 130 Law 81 In July 1997, Cuba enacted Law 81, entitled The Law of the Environment . Although grounded in the several halting steps towards environmental law noted earlier, Law 81 was itself revolutionary in its sweep, and in at least the apparent powers it would confer on CITMA. The provisions of Law 81 had been incubating for more than two years, during which CITMA personnel presented and defended their proposals through rounds of negotiations with the traditional ministries and provincial and local governments. The initiative was led by the Environmental Policy Directorate, whose attorney had been making the case and outlining the provisions for a new law for nearly a decade. 131 Predictably, the law was criticized both as too strong (\"environmental protection is a game for the r ich; our priority now is development, and later we will see\"), 132 and too weak (\"[t]hey wanted to see, specifically inscribed, the administrative rules and penalties that we had left for the respective bodies to develop. . . \"). 133 At bottom there were questi ons of turf. \"Another important line of discussion, put forth primarily by representatives of the agencies of the central administration, particularly those that had ad - ministered resources\" was the \"scope of the attributions and functions of CITMA\"; they would say, and one can imagine not at all complimentarily, that this was not the Law of the Environment, but ________________________________ ________________________ 130.

When Law 81 was finally presented to the National Assembly, it passed unanimously, a result that might seem surprising for a law with the potential to tread on so many toes. It was strongly supported by representatives from rural districts who had heard from people back home, 136 as well as, doubtless, the Party. Law 81 is, in the tradition of several Latin American countries, a comprehensive framework law. Unli ke the separate programs of the U.S. and Europe, Law 81 has 14 titles and 163 articles that embrace air, water, waste, noise, toxic substances, historic preservation, biological diversity, national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, coastal zone management, education, research and technology, environ - mental impact assessment and planning, inspection, enforcement, and penalty regimes. The Law progresses in a logical march from general principles (e.g., the right to a healthy environment, the pre - cautionary p rinciple, the right to information and of participation in decision making); 137 to the authorities of CITMA and other government bodies; 138 to instruments of administration (e.g., land use planning, the environmental impact statement, economic instruments); 139 and to treatment of specific environmental issues (e.g., biological diversity, protected areas, waters and aquatic ecosystems, mineral and energy resources). 140 In this distribution and redistribution of authority, CITMA emerged with two new and powerful too ls for environmental management and control. The first power was the elevation of an environmental impact review process to the status of law, 141 managed by CITMA, that would apply both to individual projects and, in what has proven to be far more controver sial in the United States and Europe, the plans and programs of other agencies. 142 In this process CITMA would not only approve the procedures of other agencies in somewhat the same ________________________________ ________________________ 134.

It is also a framework law, which means that in order to take hold it would need to be implemented by further laws and regulations. Who held what cards would to some extent be revealed in this next step, in which the tensions among competing agencies and interests would surface once again. For the next three years, CITMA would move into a largely lawmaking mode \u2014 developing, proposing, and ena cting three laws for the issues it considered most important and achievable: environmental impact assessment, coastal zone management, and biological diversity.

The United States started here in the 1970's; 149 Cuba started here in the 1990's. 150 Following the adoption of Law 81, whic h contained authorization for more than a dozen new programs, Cuba chose to make impact analysis its first order of business. It was an obvious choice, if for no other reason than evaluating the effects of a proposal before acting on it is so obviously, u n- arguably sensible. These evaluations, due to their comprehensive nature, play a particularly important role in countries that do not have the resources to expend on separate, finely -calibrated pollution control and management programs. The thought of e xporting, for example, the Clean Air Act/National Ambient Air Quality Standards/State Implementation Plan/Prevention of Significant Deterioration program to Cuba \u2014 or to any other country for that matter \u2014 is daunting. 151 Even the United States, with resour ces to burn and the highest levels of science and technology in the world, can barely make rational regulatory decisions given the complexity of the tasks involved. 152 Many developing countries rely on impact analysis to provide these controls on an ad -hoc, \"best professional judgement\" basis.

In 1995, with only slim statutory support, the newly -created CITMA issued a regulation requiring impact analysis for major projects. 154 The regulation contained the bare -bones elements of impact review but fell short in several critical regards, such as the consideration of alternatives and of cumulative impacts. These shortfalls were shared by, inter alia , the Europ ean Union and other Western systems. The Regulation also failed for its want of authority over the actions of other agencies. Three years later, Law 81 pro - vided the authority CITMA needed. CITMA now proceeded to develop new impact analysis regulations 155 and, in so doing, wrestled with many of the same questions that the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions have faced with impact assessment. A few of these questions, and their resolution, merit particular attention. A. What and When Although the questions \"what\" and \"when\" produce distinctly different answers in common English usage, in the world of impact analysis they are closely related and together define the scope of the process. All will agree that mere ideas are too premature to trigg er an impact analysis; all will agree as well that specific projects pro - posed for set locations should require one. The gray zone lies along the range of decision -making in between, and in particular those government policies, programs, and management pl ans that set the stage for individual actions such as timber harvests, highway pro - jects, and power plants. Speaking generally, it is close to a truism that the earlier impact analysis is provided and the more broadly the proposal is perceived, the more e ffective the analysis will be. 156 Impacts can be avoided; improvements can be made. Conversely, the later in decision -making the analysis is conducted, the less ________________________________ ________________________ 153. See Robertson v.

For these reasons, the U.S. President's Council on Environmental Quality regulations call for early analysis ( see 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.4 (2000)) on a broad scale of actions and proposals (see 40 C.F.R. \u00a71502.5 (200 0)). 28 J. LAND USE & ENVTL. L. [Vol. 16.1 effective it will be. The big picture is already set; the analysis treats only the details. For this reason, environmentalists support early and broad analysis. For the same reason, developers and develop - ment agencies oppose it. 157 CITMA's regulations begin by listing classes of projects that will in all cases require analysis. 158 This is, inter alia , the European approach 159 and it stands in contrast to the system in the United States, in which the need for a statement on a particular activity is decided on an ad hoc, case -by-case basis. The regulations also in - clude, however, other projects that CITMA determines will have significant effects, 160 re-introducing the same case -by-case scrutiny for close cases seen in the United States. The regulations explicitly require analysis of government policies and programs, either prospective or on -going, 161 and further require the consideration of all phases of a particular proposal together, from the start. 162 These \"programmatic\" and \"cumulative\" impact re - quirements arose from U.S. case law in the 1970's 163 and can be very big medicine. 164 Comprehensive reviews of transportation programs, for example, as opposed to reviewing the impacts of specific road projects, go to the heart of their impacts (e.g., con - gestion, pollution) and to more sustainable solutions (e.g., rapid transit systems). 165 The absence of these requirements in European Union impact assessment law has been identified as a severe short - coming, and is the subject of regular hard -fought proposals to bring Europe on board with broader impact analysis earlier in the game. 166 ________________________________ ________________________ 157.

Cuban governance raises two additional problems with the scope and timing of impact review relating to land use planning and foreign investment. 1. Planning and Micro -localizati on Starting in the 1970's, Cuba began a system of national planning that attempted to make decisions over its land base that were more rational than those that had previously committed over half of the island to sugar. This process is managed by the Mini stry of Planning and, in theory, zoning plans exist for all provinces. 167 Many are only marginally current, however, and none were prepared with an eye to environmental impacts. 168 All projects in Cuba are subject to Planning Ministry review and approval per the contents of these zoning plans, a process called \"micro -localization.\" 169 Resolution 77/99 requires applicants for environmental licenses to have already received micro -localization approvals. 170 Once these decisions are made, however, they have the pra ctical effect of fixing the location of activities that can have considerable environmental impact, such as hotels, roads, and mining operations. Indeed, location is often the central issue in environmental review. The relative timing of environmental re view and micro -localization decisions remains an open and important question. 171 2. Foreign Investment Licensing Foreign investment presents an even more preliminary and fundamental decision -point as the development with the most ________________________________ ________________________ (identifying the failure to require \"strategic environmental assessment\" as a major shortcoming in EU impact analysis). 167.

Ideally, of course, Cuba's land use plans form the basis for more proactive and comprehensive decision -making than is possible under NEPA, which reacts to specific proposals. Several states in the United States take a s imilar, comprehensive approach. See THOMAS G. P ELHAM , STATE LAND -USE PLANNING AND REGULATION 151 (1979); see generally HENRY L. DIAMOND & PATRICK F. N OONAN , LAND USE IN AMERICA (1996)(describing state land use programs of Vermont, Oregon and Florida). One way to integrate EIA in these systems, and an approach that has been adapted in Chile for example, is to require detailed environmental review of the plans themselves, following which compliance with the plan is deemed to satisfy environmental requirements . See Ricardo Katz, Presentation at the Workshop on Environmental Impact Evaluation, Havana, Cuba (Oct. 29, 1999). 30 J. LAND USE & ENVTL. L. [Vol. 16.1 potential to change the Cu ban landscape. The major investments today, and for at least the short -term future, will relate to tourism and mineral development \u2014 activities well known for adverse impacts, and with their own histories of bad management through - out the Caribbean and La tin America. The first step for foreign investment in Cuba is a license from the Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation, at which the basic contours of the deal \u2014 from property rights, to joint - ventures, to percentages, to special require ments for the use of Cuban labor and technology \u2014 are set. 172 Applications are circulated to all ministries 173 including CITMA; final decisions are re - ferred to the Council of Ministries. 174 It is obvious that this process, and the assumptions within it on app ropriate locations and technologies for a proposed enterprise, could eclipse subsequent environmental review. Anticipating this problem, Cuba's Law of Foreign Investment provides a substantive standard for environmental protection and a process driven by CITMA for carrying it out. The standard for foreign investment is that it be made \"in the context of sustainable development\" and executed with care for the \"protection of the environment and the rational use of natural resources.\" 175 The process calls for CITMA to determine the need for an environmental impact analysis during the coordination stage, and the considerations necessary for an environmental license. 176 CITMA is further authorized to prescribe those measures it considers necessary for possible da mages and environmental risks. 177 These authorities grant environmental impact review and CITMA a lead role in foreign investment decisions. Whether the agency has the political strength to play this role is another question, and one that cannot be answere d on the record to date. Set as they are in law, however, these environmental standards and requirements have the potential to take on a life of their own. 178 ________________________________ ________________________ 172.

In the end, one is forced to choose between insiders and outsiders, which can often mean tradeoffs among conflicting goals of (1) expertise, (2) impartiality, and (3) impact on the decision itself. One option is to leave the process to the mission agencies, as does the United States, where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers analyzes the impacts of its dams and navigation canals, the Department of Transportation and state highway agencies the impacts of their on - going construction projects, and the Forest Service its timber harvests and management plans. The obvious problem with this system is that the agencies have long -standing biases in favor of programs which are their very reasons to exist. 179 Few agencies within memory have described the c onsequences of their proposals as any - thing but highly beneficial and with more than minor adverse environmental impacts. The impartiality factor is, to put the matter charitably, low. On the other hand, these agencies possess undeniable expertise in wha t they are doing, and are forced to acquire even more in order to exercise the requirements of NEPA. The Department of Transportation hires wetland biologists; the Forest Service hires ornithologists; there starts a process of greening from within. 180 Perh aps the strongest advantage of agency -driven impact assessments is the impact they may have on the decision. While on the one hand, agency environmental personnel are easier to stifle than those of other institutions; on the other hand, depending on the p ersonnel and the institutional structure, they may have more access to and influence over the decision itself. If, as the United States regulations state, the purpose of environmental analysis is not ________________________________ ________________________ in 1998 WL 1043035 (challenging European Union funding for Spanish development on failures in environmental review.) 179. See the statement of the Office of Mining Operations for the U.S. Geological Survey on the description of its mining activities in the NEPA process: When the Geological Survey has the lead in preparing environmental statements, inflammatory words such as disturbed, devastated, defiled, ravaged, gouged, scarred and destroyed should not be used.

[Vol. 16.1 better paperwork but better decisions, 181 this factor can not be ignored. Another option is to have the impact statement prepared by an independent environmental agency, such as the EPA or CITMA. This approach maximizes objectivity, but it runs the risk of producing outside, largely ignored \u2014 and certainly re sented \u2014 documents to the mission decision -making agency. It is also highly resource intensive, requiring a large environmental staff to, in effect, second -guess the expertise of the line agencies, without which capacity serious project changes cannot be proposed or defended. Many countries simply do not have the luxury of going this second route, and very few have. Another option, exercised both in Europe and in many Latin American countries, is to leave the statement to the project applicant in those many cases where the activity, such as a new industry or a wetland marina, is essentially private. 182 These systems bow more to the expediency of getting the job done in the least inconvenient manner than they do to any of the goals noted above. 183 Govern - ment personnel may not be impartial towards their projects, but they at least do not have their individual incomes at stake with the approval of each proposal. 184 There is, further, no inherent institutional expertise in the private sector which may not build these plants or marinas with sufficient frequency to know, or care about, their environmental effects. The perpetuation of applicant -driven systems, in spite of their obvious biases and defects, is testimony to the distance independent environmental anal ysis has yet to travel on the world stage. A last option to which many nations are coming to resort, including the United States, is the use of outside consultants. Environmental engineering consultant firms abound in every major city in the United Stat es. These firms conduct the actual preparation of impact statements for everything from new highway construction to new industrial facilities. Long on expertise (for this is what they do for a living), they are short on impact, and may be equally short on impartiality. In many cases, highway construction for example, ________________________________ ________________________ 181.

Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 33 the construction contracts worth tens of millions of dollars will go to these same consulting firms once the impact statement is approved. 185 United States regulations attempt to cure this in fluence by requiring a statement of all consultants disavowing financial interest in the project, as well as independent federal agency review of the statements prepared. 186 In practice, both safeguards prove to be more fig leaves than substance. 187 In fact, the United States system relies on other checks and balances, discussed below, to assure at least a measure of objectivity. Cuba has sorted out this conflict of goals and options with a system of consultants -cum-safeguards, which may or may not work. The choice is rational, if not inevitable. Cuban mission agencies have little expertise in environmental issues, and even fewer resources to obtain it. They are going to have to look to the outside. On the other hand, Cuba has significant wealth in scie ntists and in scientific expertise, a ready pool for consultant work. The Cuban solution is to allow consultant preparation of the environmental analysis, 188 and require payment of the consultant by the applicant. 189 The con - sultants for any given project, h owever, are drawn ostensibly at random from a list of approved consultants, pre -screened for expertise by CITMA. 190 This qualification and selection process is designed to secure impartiality. Its flaws include the ineludible fact that, if the applicant is paying, it will want approval and it will have the leverage of employing a favorable consultant in many ways in the future. Working in Cuba for the Sol Melia hotel chain, for example, is worth its weight in gold. 191 The Cuban system is also flawed at the moment by the paucity of approved consulting firms; one central firm has cornered the lion's share of the assessment work ________________________________ ________________________ 185.

[Vol. 16.1 to date. 192 In a system as politicized as that in Cuba, such a sole - source firm has to be subject to the same pressures that are faced by an agency itself. C. Alternatives Alternatives are the heart of the environmental impact statement process. 193 Few actions in life are undertaken without the consideration of alternatives. Actions whose impacts might appear to be unacceptable (e.g., running in the rain), might appear quite acceptable given certain alternatives (e.g., either run or miss the bus). At the bottom of every major action affecting the environment, from the use of pesticides to the construction of a new pier for tourism, is the question: are the impacts acceptable ... compared to what? If Cuba, the United States, or any other country is going to put itself to the expense, delay, and difficulty of environmental impact analysis, this analysis will have to consider alternative locations, modes of access, technologies, sources of materials, disposal practices, and other options at play. As central as they are to environmental decision -making, the consideration of alternatives is easily the most resisted feature of impact analy sis by the development community. 194 To a project applicant or agency proponent, this is its project, not yours. If some - one else wants to build on an upland, fine; this project is going right down by the sea. The inquiry into alternatives is intrusive; i t challenges basic assumptions about feasibility and engineering; it threatens profit margins, investment loans and conditional commitments; it requires hassles and delays to accommodate new questions; it brings in the press, the neighbors, and no end of a rm- chair quarterbacking; and, at bottom, it is downright insulting. No - body on this earth enjoys being told that, whatever he or she is doing, there is a better way. Most NEPA litigation and environ - mental activism short of litigation in the United State s revolves around, explicitly or implicitly, seeking an alternative way. ________________________________ ________________________ 192.

Alternatives are made an optional con - sideration for the applicant or, if mandatory, a requirem ent only to the extent that the applicant state why certain alternatives it considered were not adopted. 195 This single concession cripples the effect of impact analysis. The strength of the opposition to alternatives is so pronounced, however, that the Eu ropean Union only recently, after two decades of failure, changed its rules to require their fuller consideration. 196 It would have been easy to imagine that cash -short Cuba would have taken the path of less resistance here. It didn't. Instead, Resolut ion No. 77/99 makes explicit that alternatives, including alternative locations, be identified by the con - sultant in its application for a CITMA license. 197 The statement itself, if then required, is to include the description of \"distinct,\" \"feasible\" alternative projects and their relative -environmental impacts, including the alternative of not acting at all; from these, the identification of the alternative \"most favorable to the environment\" is also required. 198 CITMA's review of the adequacy of the state ment is based, in turn, on the availability of less harmful alternatives, both to central project features and to provisions for mitigation. 199 In so doing, CITMA has allied itself with United States jurisprudence and practice, and given its system a chance for meaningful effect. D. Review Given the fact that impact assessment processes are inevitably tainted by the preconceptions of those who conduct the assessments, the final challenge is to offset these preconceptions in an institutional way. 200 This cha llenge is often misunderstood by those who are developing and participating in EIA systems as an affront to their integrity.

In the United States, a process driven by proponent agencies begs for independent revie w, and the integrity of the NEPA system indeed depends on several external mechanisms that act as an exo - skeleton for a process that is inherently biased at the core. 201 The first of these is public participation, solicited from the start with notices of me etings to scope the parameters of a statement 202 and continuing through public comment on the draft statement, 203 required responses to public comment, 204 a final statement, and, 205 ultimately, judicial review. 206 A second supporting process is the review by expert agencies. 207 Their views and opinions, while not dispositive, may carry considerable weight both within the federal family and, implicitly but very much present in the wings, in the evidence it provides for the media and citizen -suit litigation. 208 This review is carried to the next level by the separate statutory require - ment that the EPA review and rate both the adequacy of an environmental statement and the proposal itself. 209 Projects found objectionable by EPA or other agencies may be referred to the President's Council on Environmental Quality which, although to the distress of some does not possess a veto power, has the authority to convene hearings, mediate, jawbone, and refer to the President for resolution projects with major unresolved environmental conflicts. 210 In all, the U.S. process works indirectly by its transparency and by the intervention of others to induce the selection of better alternatives, mitigating measures, and lessened adverse effects. Very few projects are stopped under NEPA; 211 many however, are modified, \u2014 some right from the start in unseen ways, and some after long and open contest \u2014 in favor of environmental protection. ________________________________ ________________________ 201.

Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 37 In Resolution 77/99, Cuba leaves itself the room to adopt several of the mechanisms that have reinforced impac t analysis in the United States. It has not yet, on the other hand, committed itself to them in ways that assure either their perpetuation or effect. Resolution 77/99 charges CITMA with the adoption of necessary measures for con - sidering the interests an d concerns of the public in general, and, more specificially, those in the project area. 212 The application for license must document the public information and consultation con - ducted by the applicant, in compliance with these measures; 213 the subsequent imp act statement is to include the results of consultation with local authorities and the public. 214 Lastly, provision is made for the applicant to appeal environmental decisions within CITMA, much as within a United States agency. 215 Here the similarities end. There is no public participation in the all-important process of project scoping, which defines the review to follow. 216 There is no explicit provision for interagency comment, or for public comment, either on the statement or on a proposed licensing deci sion. There is no right of the general public to appeal within CITMA either the absence of an environmental analysis, defective analysis licensing conditions, or the licensing decision itself. CITMA may yet promulgate these rights. So far, Resolution 77/99 does not get there. 217 It could be argued that, in these regards, the Resolution fails to implement either Article 27 of the Constitution 218 or Article 4 of the Law of the Environment. 219 These criticisms noted, it should also be said that, apart from the United States, such public rights are far from the norm.

Supplementary, implementing regulations on public participation will certainly be easier for the rest of Cuban government to swallow once the initial shocks of the system have been absorbed, and the process is under way. As with many Latin countrie s, and indeed many civil law jurisdictions, public involvement in government decisionmaking is a new phenomenon. The most sound observation that can be made about this aspect of Cuba's impact statement process is that CITMA is approaching the question wit h caution, and that it has not yet answered it fully.

It is a major test f or any country and one that many countries do not bother to sit for, much less pass. The world's coastal zones are some of the most biologically rich eco -regions on earth, harboring seabed grasses, kelp forests, oyster beds, coral reefs, shellfish flats, tidal pools, sea caves and ledges, beaches, dune grasses, sea oats, cheniers, mangroves, salt marshes, intermediate and freshwater marshes, bays, keys, estuaries, river mouths, hard - wood swamps and similar universes which support more than a quarter of the world's primary plant production, 224 ninety percent of its seafood, 225 nearly all of its migratory waterfowl, 226 and provide enormous, additional services in pollution control, flood control and the buffering of coastal storms at virtually no cost. The case ca n be made that these resources are the greatest bargain on earth. 227 The case can also be made that, at current odds, they do not stand a chance of survival. Fully half of the world's population lives within 50 miles of saltwater, and the numbers are growi ng.228 By the year 2020, the coastal zones alone will hold the same number of people as on the entire planet only thirty years before. 229 China's coastal population is increasing by ten percent or more per year, although the national growth rate is only 1.2 %.230 The population of ________________________________ ________________________ 223.

However, few countries of the world have met the challenge of coastal management with any commitment or success. Which brings us to Cuba, whose primary advantage is that late 20th century population booms, industrial -strength tourism, and high -grade industrial contamination passed it by. To be sure, its major coastal cities discharge directly into the ocean, and only seventeen percent of sewage nationwide currently receives even primary treatment. 246 Indeed, lumping all 2,355 Cuban agricultural, industrial and domestic waste sources toget her, some fifty percent have malfunctioning treatment systems and forty percent have no treatment systems at all. 247 Adding serious agricultural erosion 248 to these loads presents a picture that is both depressing and typical of virtually every country of the Caribbean and Central America, indeed the world.

For Cuba's biological diversity on the one hand, and its economic development on the other, these are \"The Prize.\" The question i s what Cuba will do with, and how much it will sacrifice for, coastal tourism. It has already had some sad experiences, particularly with a Miami Beach -cum -Cancun like resort hotel complex at Varadero on the north coast. 249 The mangroves were cut, the dune s were leveled, the buildings sit cheek -by-jowl on the beach itself and their wastes are funneled away, not far, to sewage lagoons. 250 Beach erosion has inevitably set in, and Cuba has begun Florida -style, offshore sand dredging to slow it down, trying to sustain the unsustainable. 251 Varadero draws tourists and will certainly draw more, but at least within CITMA, it is recognized as a problem and an object lesson in what not to do. 252 Of course, the same object lessons are also arising in Haiti and Puerto Ric o.253 With Cuba's authorization of independent and joint ventures for foreign investors, 254 the road to big time tourism is now open. As of 1998, there were 21 joint ventures in tourism led by the Spanish -owned Sol Melia, with eight hotels operating and thre e more planned for construction that same year. Of the new hotels, one would be in Havana, one would be on the coast in the province of Holguin, and one on Coco Key, all of which are in the coastal zone. 255 Independent analysts project Cuba to receive $18. 5 billion in economic impact from tourism by the year 2007; that number rises to $27.7 if free market capitalism has its way. 256 As Cuba's Vice - President of the Counsel of State stated in 1998, \"I would not say that tourism is one of the sectors most import ant, tourism is the heart of the economy.\" 257 The implications of this growth on the coasts are obvious, but are dependant on where and how the growth occurs.

Decree Law 212 was hammered out within the agency and with other Ministry personnel during 1998, and finally approved in 2000. 259 The Law pres cribes two zones: a \"coastal zone\" extending seaward to the continental shelf (between 100 and 200 meters depth) and from twenty to forty meters landward from a base; 260 and a second, \"protection zone\" extending another twenty to forty meters inland. 261 The coastal zone is declared to be open, public and free for public use; 262 all coastal development, including causeways and roads, is required to provide pedestrian and public access. 263 Articles 15 through 18 hold the keys to the gut issue: development control . Article 15 begins with a general rule that \"the coastal zone will remain presumptively unoccupied\" by permanent structures. 264 In language that echoes United States law and that of several coastal states, activities and development will only be allowed a s an exception to the general rule \"where their purpose does not allow location outside the coastal zone,\" such as ports, piers, drilling plat - forms, navigation signals and national defense works. 265 In areas of the zone currently unoccupied by permanent st ructures, no new permanent installations will be permitted \"except where justified for political or social reasons.\" 266 Several uses are specifically prohibited in the zone, including: sand extraction, land vehicles, new residences and hotels or enlargemen ts of existing ones, and the disposal of ________________________________ ________________________ 258.

Under this law, new tourist hotels, roadways and the like will be stepped back from at least 40 to 80 meters from the vegetati on line, which is to say from the dunes and beach. When one considers seaside development along Tampa, Florida, for example, or Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, these become significant requirements. The agency review process is a bit more delicate. The Decree Law, in effect, creates a third zone of protection, through planning, under the joint custody of CITMA and the Ministry of Economy and Planning. As described earlier in this article, the Ministry of Economy and Planning is Cuba's lead land use agen cy; under Law 212 it remains in charge of \"directing, formulating and controlling\" coastal development, 269 including the master land use plans and site - specific \"microlocalizacion\" decisions. 270 These plans and decisions, however, are to conform to the requir ements of the new coastal law. CITMA will \"participate\" in the \"discussion, evaluation and approval\" of the zoning plans and decisions, \"seeking to introduce modifications that are deemed appropriate.\" 271 CITMA also reviews all impact assessments for these plans and projects, and grants the earlier -described environmental licenses. 272 Finally, CITMA is directed to \"approve, direct and control\" the development of \"integrated coastal zone management strategies\" 273 and \"their implementation,\" 274 to reconcile differ ences among agencies and other entities over coastal uses, and to issue the Law. 275 Given these at least parallel, if not conflicting, authorities, it will not be clear for some time how their exercise will play out and which agency will emerge with the fin al say.

Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 45 clear that Law 212 grants CITMA the maximum amount of decision - making power short of repealing the long -standing functions of the Ministry of Planning and starting anew. While conflicts between the Ministries may be inevitable, the combination of the two carries the upside potential of greater resources and administrative capacity for coastal management, somewhat similar to the concurrently -operated state coastal management and Environmental Protection Agency and Corps of Engineers wetlands protection programs in the United States. 276 Law 212 accords a final set of protections for development of the Cuban keys, which, from the point of view of tourist development, are the prize within The Prize. Cuban projection for n ew housing on the coasts is relatively limited; 277 housing on the keys is identified by the Ministry of Economy and Planning as only nine percent of its projected capacity. 278 Obviously, the tug -of-war will be over the keys. Under Law 200, all permanent stru ctures development or activities on the keys will run the gauntlet of a full environmental impact analysis and a CITMA license. 279 All construction is to be on solid ground, and in conpliance with the aforementioned setback re - quirements. 280 Construction is prohibited outright on keys smaller in size than the diameter of the coastal zone, and on those identified by CITMA as being particularly fragile, in the process of beach accretion, or covered by mangrove vegetation. 281 No wastes will be treated on keys exc ept in systems proven in advance to be effective. 282 To be sure, these are hardly prohibitions. They are, however, clearly legal handles. They are also incentives to develop tourism on the keys in a different, low -impact manner. There is no need to put hotels on the keys in order to view their wildlife or snorkel their reefs, and these alternative possibilities are now producing proposals for ecotourism that, in the long run, could be both profitable and en - vironmentally sustainable.

Into the fray will come the Ministries of Economy and Planning, Tour ism, Foreign Investment, Mining, Forestry, Fisheries, and Agriculture, as well as foreign investment and private interests with their own axes to grind. No one can say how these battles will be resolved, although there is preliminary evidence that they le ad to the same kind of incomplete compromises that are found in most coastal states and nations, or at least in those jurisdictions that pay any attention to the subject at all. Hotels will be stepped back from the mangroves, but will go forward. 284 Causew ays will run to big keys, but with elevations to preserve hydrology and aquatic life. 285 Decisions like this, and far worse, are made in Louisiana, Mississippi and other Gulf Coast states every day. 286 For the moment, it is enough to observe that Cuba, in th e face of an economic imperative to develop its coasts for tourism greater than that driving any state of the United States or any nation of the Caribbean or Central America, has enacted a program which must be rated favorably for its specificity and its p otential for protection.

Presently in Cuba, the data look sound, the lead agency looks committed, the popular and political supp ort are wild cards, and, as later discussed, the legal system is by no means up to its supporting role. 287 VII. B IOLOGICAL DIVERSITY On a worldwide basis, biodiversity tends to be concentrated in the southern countries, while the institutions and resources for studying it tend to be located in the northern countries ... Cuba provides an extreme case. With respect to biodiversity, it is the single most important country in the Caribbean islands, and this is true to an overwhelming degree. 288 Dr. Michael Smith As the Castro government loses its tight control over the population, the mountain land will again be open to development. Additional pressures on the rain forest will arise because this is also a mineral rich area with proven deposits of manganese, coppe r, silver and gold. It is necessary to plan to protect the rain forests now. If plans are not in place, there will be little time to make them when Castro's fall triggers a rush to repopulate the area and clear the rain forests for agriculture. 289 Biopros pective, in a Post -Castro Cuba The idea of protecting biological diversity originated in the 1990's, relatively out of nowhere, and took center stage in international environmental law.

As a concept, biolo gical diversity means two related but different things. The first is the conservation of biological resources, which most countries including the United States, have been approaching in a halting, piecemeal fashion for many years. Indeed, the history of conservation in the United States began with the setting aside of parks and forest reserves in the 1800's, 292 adding protections for certain wildlife species 293 and, then, endangered species in the 1900's, 294 without any particular effort, even by the year 2000, to identify the diversity of domestic species or to provide for their long - term perpetuation. The second face of biodiversity concerns access to and use of biological resources, basically genetic materials, for medicines, crop improvements and the explod ing field of bio - technology. On this theme, the United States finds itself even more in arrears, with virtually no program to determine either access or uses beyond that found in traditional food and drug laws. 295 In Cuba, both issues of biodiversity woul d become critical at the close of the century. Its biodiversity was extraordinary and largely unprotected, and the economic value of these resources in bio - technology became an element critical to Cuba's economic survival. It is hard to overstate the bi ological importance of Cuba. A basic principle of conservation biology holds that the diversity of species increases on two axes, one being the size of the land mass under study, and the other being its isolation from other land masses and their species. 296 Large islands meet both criteria, hence the rich diversity of flora and fauna in Madagascar, Australia, Hawaii, and Cuba. 297 The Caribbean Islands host about 15,000 identified plant species, nearly the same number found in all of the United States and Canada combined. 298 Cuba, with 6,500 known plant species, 299 holds ________________________________ ________________________ 290.

The W est Indies have lost over ninety percent of their land mammals since the 1500's. 306 Since that time, twenty -five to thirty percent of worldwide mammalian extinction has occurred on these islands. 307 That Cuba would hold such a rich, remaining inventory of fl ora and fauna is largely an accident of its history and relic pockets of its geography, which bought time for conservation to come into play. Cuba's growing attention to biodiversity protection may be chronicled as pre -revolution, post -revolution, and p ost-Rio, 1992. As described earlier in this article, Cuba's expertise in the natural sciences dates back nearly two centuries. 308 Starting in 1930, Cuba began designating natural areas, but without legal protections or management, these declarations remain ed largely exercises on paper. 309 One of the first acts of the revolution was the Law of Agrarian Reform, which charged the state with protecting its natural areas, promoted programs of reforestation, and excluded forest reserves from distribution to agricu ltural collectives. 310 In the 1980's, additional natural areas were designated as biosphere reserves and ________________________________ ________________________ 299.

[Vol. 16.1 initial efforts were directed towards creating a national system of protected areas. 311 The centerpiece of the 1992 World Summit in Rio was the Conventio n on Biological Diversity. 312 The Convention not only declared \"conservation of biological diversity,\" the \"sustainable use\" of its components, and the \"equitable sharing\" of the benefits of genetic resources to be goals of the Convention, but also further required signatory countries to develop \"national strategies, plans, or programs\" for the sustainable use of biodiversity. 313 More specifically, it required is member nations to establish systems of protected areas, to maintain viable populations of species in natural surrounding, to restore degraded ecosystems and promote the re - covery of endangered species. 314 One hundred and seventy -two nations have since signed on to the treaty. Cuba, in 1993, was one of the first and CITMA took the exercise to heart. For those who like detailed planning, the next steps will fulfill their every wish. In 1996 the International Union for the Conservation of Nature funded a detailed profile of the institutional and legal framework for the management of biological resources in Cuba. 315 The resulting document, authored by the current chief of CITMA's Environmental Policy Directorate, was both a summary of the hydra -headed nature of Cuban resource management, and a compelling case for change. Presaging Law 81 and many of its pr o- visions, 316 the profile identified gaps in public and private law generally, 317 and with specific regard to species protection and to control of genetic resources. 318 In effect, the profile stated that with regard to the Convention it had ratified a few years earlier, Cuba was way behind the eight ball. The next step called for in the Convention, and neatly congruent with Cuba's penchant for strategies, was the development of a National Strategy and Plan of Action for Biological Diversity. 319 Funded again by the United Nations and published in 1998, the plan had gone through an elaborate, two -year process of initial drafting, national and regional workshops, second drafting, more workshops, ________________________________ ________________________ 311.

It identified forty -two separate ecosystems, 321 seventeen of which were characterized as ecologically sensitive. Based on factors of rarity and value, the strategy ranked six ecosystems of highest im - portance, including wet forest, high mountain, and littoral areas. 322 The strategy was also an action document stat ing that diversity conservation must be the \"fundamental pillar\" for sustainable de - velopment in Cuba, 323 and providing no fewer than 142 separate action items, each delegated to an identified lead agency, including participating agencies and time frame for completion (e.g. short, medium or long range). 324 Fourteen of these actions related to the development of law. 325 Among these were legal systems for di - versity protection 326 and access to biological resources. 327 Meanwhile, Cuba's scientific and technological investments in biological resources were beginning to bear fruit. Unlike many countries in Latin America seeking to control foreign access to the genetic heritage of their natural areas, or more realistically, to obtain at least modest revenue from foreig n corporations developing it, Cuban science was very much in the game of product development. One of the early natural areas established by the government in 1959 was the Zapata Swamp, set aside as a reserve for the Cuban Crocodile, which at that time was thought to be gravely endangered if not extinct. 328 The recovery program included captive breeding, which has been so successful that plans are currently in the works for the sale of crocodile parts and products. 329 This success has in turn prompted efforts in aquaculture and other forms of commercial captive breeding. 330 Cuba began working on biotechnology as early as 1965 with the establishment of a National Center for Scientific Research, whose ________________________________ ________________________ 320.

Since that time, Center scientists have developed the use of ozone to fight germs, speed the healing of wounds, and improve blood circulation; the use of new ther apies for speech and hearing impaired children; and vaccines for cholera and other diseases. 331 In 1981, Cuba started a Center for Genetic Engineering and Bio - technology that was the beginning of a $1 billion investment over the past twelve years. 332 The C enter was producing the drug interferon within three years of its discovery in Finland, 333 and is now marketing inter alia , a recombinant hepatitis vaccine, a cattle tick vaccine, and industrial enzymes. 334 Reportedly in the works are a possible AIDS vaccine and disease -resistant strains of coffee, papaya and pineapple plants. 335 A new Center for Pharmaceutical Chemistry expands this work on products from both expired patents and native sources. 336 With funding from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organi zation in 1997, Cuba developed biological controls for an insect plague affecting a dozen domestic crops. 337 Through a network of more than 200 laboratories and three pro - duction factories, it is creating other biological agents to control infestations of t omatoes, tobacco, cabbage, cucumbers, plantain, yucca, maize and coffee. 338 The limiting factor for biotechnology in Cuba is apparently not technology, but marketing. 339 In 1998, the United Nations Development Program announced new marketing support for Cuba , with a prediction that biotechnology will be \"one of the life rafts for the Cuban economy.\" 340 Compelled forward by the Rio Convention's conservation mandates and by its own need to manage a growing biotechnology ________________________________ ________________________ 331.

The law is divided in equal measure betwee n conservation and biotechnology management. The law's general conservation provisions declare the Bio - diversity Strategy and Action Plan to be the operative instruments for biodiversity planning. 342 The Strategy -cum -Plan is to, inter alia , establish crite ria and indicators for sustainable use, and the basis for an endangered species program. 343 All national and foreign entities working with Cuban biological resources are to include in their budgets sufficient moneys to carry out the actions of the Strategy/ Plan. 344 The law then proceeds to make special provisions for sensitive species and sensitive ecosystems. It recognizes five categories of protected species: rare, vulnerable, endangered, critical, and extinct. 345 CITMA is to develop a National Red Book, si milar to that of the IUCN, classifying all eligible species. 346 Any citizen or institution may petition the agency for the addition of threatened or endangered species. 347 Candidate species, about which insufficient information exists, are to be subject to s pecial protections and used only for scientific investigation relating to their classification. 348 CITMA is prohibited from granting an environmental license for an activity that would cause a species to be listed in any of the aforementioned categories, or that would cause it to be placed in a category of higher risk. 349 CITMA is furthermore required to establish protective measures appropriate for each category of species, 350 and to approve management plans of other Ministries to implement these protections. 351 The protections for sensitive ecosystems are equally explicit. CITMA is to identify such ecosystems according to Rio Convention ________________________________ ________________________ No. _____, De la Diversidad Biol\u00f3gica, April 2000 (draft, unpublished, on file with author). 342.

For endangered species, the law is similar to the Endangered Species Act in its fundamental structure, with provisions for listing, protections, and recovery planning. 356 As in the United States, 357 outside parties in Cuba may petition for new listings and, given the knowledge and activity of the Cuban scientific community, this process may turn out to drive the listings forward. The listing categories are more ample than those found in the ESA, which inclu des only endangered and threatened species. 358 The standards of protection, prohibiting impacts that would elevate a species' classification, are also more protective than that of the ESA, which prohibits only activities that would \"jeopardize the continued existence\" of a species. 359 Recovery planning is, likewise, potentially more power ful, through the requirement that these plans be incorporated in the plans and activities of other agencies. In the United States, recovery plans are not so incorporated, a nd are often ignored. 360 On the endangered species' side, this is stronger law than that in the United States. ________________________________ ________________________ 352.

In recent years, the United States Congress has avoided even the idea of identifying biological diversity or endangered ecosystems, 361 much less protecting them. 362 In the Strategy, Cuba has already done the work of identifying its sensitive ecosystems and placing them in rank order of importance and endangerment. 363 The first method it has chosen to secure their con - servation is the indicator species approach, referenced in the Rio Convention. 364 The United States has adopted this same approach in the management of its National Forests 365 and on the occasions where it has been conscientiously applied, has realized considerable success. 366 Highly controversial in the United States, in large part because of the protections it affords, this approach has not been adopted by any other U.S. agency. The proposed law's second layer of protection, based on ecosystem functions, is terra incognita for the United States and most countries. 367 The exception to this protection which the Cuban law provides, based on findings of an overriding national purpose and the demonstration of no alte rnative courses of action, is the same escape valve found in United States laws pro - tecting public parks, wetlands and endangered species. 368 ________________________________ ________________________ peril, with roughly a 20% probability of extinction within 20 years or 10 generations, whichever is longer.\"). 361.

[Vol. 16.1 The access and biotechnology provisions are remarkable in granting CITMA the power to negotiate and sign all contr acts for access to biological resources, including genetic resources 369 and the related knowledge and culture of local communities. 370 This authority is not surprising, given the large web of scientific institutes and research stations already under the CITMA umbrella. Access to resources under the management of another agency, such as the Ministry of Forestry, requires both permission from that agency, in the form of a permit, and a contract with CITMA. 371 Access is to be limited where, inter alia , it could a ffect listed species, sensitive eco - systems, public health or biological security. 372 These limits noted, the terms and conditions are in CIMTA's hands. 373 In sum, in its proposed law for biodiversity, CITMA has taken advantage of the Rio Biodiversity Conven tion to move forward several large steps towards ecosystem management and the management of genetic materials. Its conservation provisions, on their face, exceed those that are found in United States law, and indeed address the issue more comprehensively than the United States has yet dared to do. Its biotechnology provisions impose management also unknown to the United States, although similar to those in several Latin American countries with significant biological resources. 374 Whether the law finally emerges in this or a modified form, the remaining questions of implementation and enforcement remain, as is the case with environmental impact analysis and coastal management, discussed below. Implementation begins, however, with substantive law, and Cuba has begun to create law on these issues that is both action -forcing and open to observe. To be sure, these laws could simply prove to be a higher level of lip service. If so, however, Cuba has invested seven years and considerable resources creating an entire new Ministry in order to fool the world. A more likely conclusion is that the Cuban government wants this process to go forward, but that large obstacles stand in the way. ________________________________ ________________________ 369.

I MPLEMENTATION After proposing the Biodiversity law, CITMA put its s ubstantive law-making machine on hold to concentrate on implementation of the current laws. Within the Agency, this is the province of the Office of Environmental Management and Inspection, 375 with technical support from more than two -dozen CITMA institutes and other agencies. 376 It is also somewhat terra nova both in its process and the standards that will be applied. Law 81 required CITMA to develop a system of environmental inspections and enforcement, 377 and a schedule of penalties for environmental viola tions. 378 In its inspection system, CITMA may enlist other resources, including non -governmental organizations to assist in these inspections, 379 and all facilities are required to provide both information as requested and access to project sites. 380 Upon discovery of irregularities, CITMA may issue compliance orders, set deadlines for their performance, suspend project licenses either temporarily or permanently, order the removal of wastes, require full restoration, 381 and refer violations for criminal prosecuti on.382 In December 1999, the Cuban Council of State approved a schedule of administrative fines for environmental violations, 383 and CITMA concurrently adopted a process delegating certain sanctions to local and provincial inspectors and authorities. 384 The au thority and process are now in place. The standards for inspections and enforcement will serve in the near future as the conditions for the environmental license. As ________________________________ ________________________ 375.

The amount of these fines is rather modest at a maximum of $5,000 per violation, and it is obvious t hat CITMA will need to resort to other sanctions and incentives to ensure compliance from multi -national corporations and other major actors.

[Vol. 16.1 described earlier, in conjunction with Cuba's emerging environ - mental impact analysis pr ogram, these analyses will provide the basis for both resource use (e.g., set -back requirements, access roads, waste management) and pollution control (e.g., discharge volume, timing, monitoring) requirements. The new coastal and biodiversity laws will pr ovide additional standards for conditions of resource management, as will at least one pre -existing standard for streamside vegetation in watershed protection. 385 For pollution control management, however, Cuba remains wedded to regulation by ambient standa rds, never an easy trick in even the best circumstances. As of July 1999, Cuba had adopted ambient standards for air quality, water quality and noise pollution. Ambient regulation re - quires at least four steps: the prescription of safe limits for pollut ants in the environment; monitoring efforts to determine when these limits are exceeded; identification of the causes of violations of these limits; and remediation of these particular causes. 386 This process was the original approach to pollution control i n the United States and other countries, and it largely failed. 387 The science, money, manpower, and political will necessary to make ambient controls work have been found lacking in virtually every program that has depended on them, including air and water quality, and hazardous waste cleanup. 388 For these reasons, United States law, and sub - sequently, that of the European Union, turned to standards based on best available technology. As a result, for the sources covered by these new, technology -based stand ards, pollution loadings plummeted. 389 On this record, ambient standards are not a good place for Cuba to begin its pollution control. On the other hand, Cuba does not have an extensive, industrial point -source base to which technology standards most easil y apply. Its agriculture and mining industries, which have the greatest environmental impact, present diffuse sources of pollution that are both difficult to measure and more easily controlled by management ________________________________ ________________________ 385.

Best technology means little with - out the money to apply it. For these reasons, Cuba's choice of a case -by-case approach to implementati on of its pollution control standards is defensible. It can be seriously doubted whether Cuba will, in practice, attempt the complex correlations required to apply ambient standards to particular facility discharges. Rather, the ambient standards will in all likelihood be used as indicators of \"hot spots,\" on which CITMA needs to focus inspection and compliance. That focus will involve the same type of \"best professional judgment\" seen in the early im - plementation of environmental law in the United State s,391 a structure for jawboning towards the best controls that a particular facility can achieve one year, and then the next, and the next. Uniform and higher -level performance standards, such as best avail - able technology, will likely be reserved for new i nvestments, 392 again as in United States law. 393 In short, Cuba will be approaching the implementation of its laws with a mix of standards and jawboning familiar to observers of environmental law in any country. Guidelines for inspection and enforcement are next on the drawing board. 394 How well they work will depend in large part, as they do everywhere, on good faith, political will and, over time, mechanisms to encourage \"beyond compliance\" environmental performance from the development sector. It will also depend on other aspects of Cuban governance that could either swallow them or be greatly influenced by the ad - vance of environmental law.

In 1989, the former Soviet Union and its socialist allies purchased roughly eighty -five percent of Cuba's exports, and pro - vided a like share of imports on heavily subsidized, econom ically favorable terms. 396 The subsidies alone amounted to an estimated $500 per Cuban citizen per year. 397 This dependency was reinforced by a United States embargo, which in the 1990's tightened to prohibit trade between the United States and Cuba and to o ppose economic assistance from other countries. 398 With the fall of the Soviet bloc, Cuba lost the major markets for its sugar and agricultural products and up to eighty percent of its imports. 399 All categories of imports were decimated, among them oil (by seventy six percent), trans - portation equipment (86 percent), consumer goods (82 percent), chemicals (72 percent), machinery, spare parts and food. The gross domestic product per capita fell by more than forty -eight percent. 400 ________________________________ ________________________ 395. Sergio Diaz -Briquets and Jorge F.

Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 61 The economy hit rock bottom in 1994 -95, from which it has begun a slow recovery. 401 The most obvious effect of the crash on the environment was that Cuba did not have the resources even to maintain its existing levels of pollution treatment and sanitation, much less advance them. Moreover, with an overwhelming need for currency, Cuba was in no position to reject whatever new proposal came down the pike, no matter what environmental impact it carried. Assessing these impacts in reverse order, the fact is that no country rejects devel opment proposals for environmental reasons. Even with the statutory authority to veto new projects in rare and valuable wetlands, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has continuously approved wetland dredge and fill projects at a rate of 10, 000 individual permits a year for almost thirty years, and has vetoed such permits only a dozen times. 402 The United States Department of the Interior, with an effective veto over federal activities threatening endangered species has, over the course of thousands of consultations since 1976, found \"jeopardy\" to species only a handful of times, and then found project modifications to avoid it. 403 At the state level, the State of Louisiana approves no end of environmentally harmful activity, 404 and it is hardly u nique in this regard. None of these observations make the case that environ - mental law is, thus, ineffective. Rather, they make the case that environmental law works by finding modifications and imposing conditions that allow development to go forward. 405 ________________________________ ________________________ 401.

CITMA, whatever its legal authority to veto a project by withholding an environmental license, 406 exercises this power by conditioning results in much the same way these results are conditioned in other countries. It will win some of these battles and lose others. There is evidence, for example, that CITMA, during the time it was getting itself together, could not hold the line on requiring private sewage treatment for new hotels in Havana. 407 There is more recent evidence, on the other hand, that the agency is holding firm on conditions for licenses to hotels in the coastal zone. 408 This is similar to the track record for environmental law found in coastal management for the State of Mississippi 409 and in air quality managemen t for the State of Texas. 410 The record is also like that of Mexico, Panama and most Latin American countries that face similar, if not quite so acute, economic imperatives. 411 Cuba may not have the option of refusing harmful projects, but refusal is rarely a n option anywhere. The power to say \"no,\" in practice, leads to less harmful projects, and this is about as far as contemporary environmental law goes.

As Fidel Castro noted in 1990, before the economic fall, \"[t]he Hungarian buses travel six kilometers on a gallon of f uel. They fill the city with smog. They poison everybody. We could get together some data. We could get statistics on the number of people killed by Hungarian buses.\" 421 With the fall, Cuba imported more than 1.2 million bicycles from China and establi shed at least five bicycle assembly plants on the island. 422 In the city of Havana alone, a 1992 estimate put 500,000 bicycles in operation, serving a population of 2.1 million. 423 One consequence of the collapse of automotive transportation has been massive inconvenience and delays.

[Vol. 16.1 one can walk the streets of Havana in safety, and in the words of one observer, \"almost smog free\" 424 ... unlike Mexico City, Guatemala City, Santiago and the capital cities of virtually every auto - dependant country of Central and South America. Beyond these immediate effects, the overall effect of Cuba's economic doldrums on environmental policy has been to buy time for that policy to take hold. While the statements of Fidel Castro that Cuba is to b ecome a \"showplace for sustainable development\" 425 ring like the rhetoric of any politician seeking world favor, the fact is Cuba has an opportunity to go farther in that direction than its neighbors who have already been overwhelmed by the automobile, dispo sable products, and unplanned development. The City of Havana still holds the rail beds of a trolley system that provided mass transit with the same level of access and convenience as that in New Orleans and many other North American cities a century ago. An operating rail system, built initially for the sugar trade, still runs in the countryside, networking the island. With only a few heavily - polluting electric power plants and a half -built nuclear station now abandoned, sun -rich Cuba has the opportunit y to build solar, wind and other technologies into a national energy system. Havana, once the most beautiful urban landscape in the Americas, could be so once again. Or it could become Miami. As discussed earlier, the same can be said for Cuban beaches, coasts, and biological resources. The most positive effect of Cuba's failed economy on its en - vironmental policy is that, in large part due to this failure, there is still an environment worth saving. Unlike many of its neighbors, Cuba has the time, bare ly, to get an environmental policy in place before a massive wave of development that is already, literally, hitting the beach. ________________________________ ________________________ 424. See id. at 286 (quoting from National Pubic Radio, 1995). The validity of this observation is diminishing over time, with inevitable influx of automobiles, leaded gasoline and minimal envi ronmental controls.

STATE -OWNED ENTERPRISES Undoubtedly, part of the failure of the primary en - vironmental agencies in Cuba to enforce environ mental laws lies inextricably in the fact that the State is the primary polluter. 426 Protection of the Environment in Cuba State -owned enterprises are, of course, closely connected to Cuba's current economic crises, but they present distinct problems for environmental policy as well. In brief, state enterprises have proven to be not only unsuccessful engines for economic growth but unresponsive to environmental policy as well. Perhaps the most conclusive lesson of world history in the twentieth century was the superiority of free market capitalism to state -owned socialism in the production of goods and services. A less well observed corollary, but equally well proven, is the lack of success any nation has had in applying environmental law to state - owned entities. As the Soviet Union emerged from its own experience with state owned industries, President Boris Yeltsin announced that it was time to tell the Russian people \"openly and honestly about the scale of the ecological disaster we have inherited\" and its effects on public health. 427 Pollution exceeded standards in every respect; a quarter of Russia's drinking waters were unsafe; all of its major rivers were polluted; and the landscape was studded with dumps of pesticides and chemical waste. 428 Even in the United States, the performance record of the federal government and of local municipal treatment systems is well below that of private industry, 429 and the costs for cleanup of federally owned nuclear energy and weapons facilities will be counted in hund reds of billions of dollars. 430 None of this is to say that free market capitalism pro - ________________________________ ________________________ 426.

The reasons for economic and environmental failure of state owned systems are much the same. Nobody who goes to city hall for a driver's license or a building permit comes away happy. There is little way to provide meaningful incentives for initiative and pro - duction, or even simple courtesy, in a government -owned facility. Moreover, there is little way to provide sanctions for noncompliance with economic or environ mental goals. It is not easy, nor very effective, for the government to fine itself. It is even less feasible to foresee a government enjoining itself for pollution violations in a court of law. These difficulties are compounded in systems that attempt, as in Cuba, to equalize wages and guarantee employment. The problems faced by the United States in sanctioning non - functioning, municipal treatment works, or under -performing defense installations, bear witness that these problems persist in the best of families. They are institutional. They present a huge problem for Cuba. Were Cuba mired in its past, this problem might defeat real environmental policy in Cuba all by itself. Cuba, however, is maneuvering rapidly to modernize its economy while, at t he same time, retaining its political grip. As noted earlier, Cuba has liberalized its foreign investment law to allow joint ventures, licenses and even ownership of Cuban property by foreign corporations. 432 These ventures are bearing fruit most noticeably in tourism, mining, ________________________________ ________________________ cost of cleaning up the worst sites is officially expected to approach $300 billion, nearly five times the price of similar destruction caused by private companies. \" Id. at A1. \"DOE this year told Congress it will spend at least $147 billion to c leanup 113 sites across the country \u2014and that the work will take another 75 years to complete. \" Id. at A33. 431.

On the table for con - sideration are the limitation and elimination of production subsidies, and adjustments to salaries and employment rights. Water and electric utilities are scaling rates to foster conservation in lieu of consumption. 440 State institutes and businesses are being given ten percent of the profits from new projects and programs that they generate; these incentives, and the competition among state entities for them, are said to have revived a light metals industry, which was all but extinct ten years ago. 441 Foreign investors a re required to \"buy Cuban,\" requirements that in the production of hotel elevators, have led first to Cuban assembly plants, then to parts manufacture, and now to the manufacture of the final product.

[Vol. 16.1 These movements noted, Cuba still faces large dinosaurs of state - owned enterprise, none so large and intractable as agriculture. It now has 156 government -owned sugar mills, with aging equipment and few environmental controls, producing only 4 million tons of sugar a year. 442 By contrast, seven mills alone in Florida produce 1.8 million tons a year. The most obvious solution would be to close 100 plants, invest in modernizing the rest, and dedicat e fifty -percent or more of the lands to different uses. The most obvious problem is that an industry that employs 400,000 workers would now employ only 85,000. The challenge here is not simply to apply best environmental management practices to sugar pro duction, but to find new uses for nearly half the productive land in Cuba and a third of a million workers. These are issues of a very large scale. Cuba knows that it must restructure its economy and is moving, albeit with some ambivalence, in the dire ction of limited, free market capitalism. This capitalism raises many of the old problems such as income inequalities, the erosion of social values, dominance by foreign banks and capital 443 that influenced the revolution of 1956, but it seems certain that the genie is now out of the bottle. Cuba is now engaged in the same high -wire tightrope act of balancing political control with a rising free market seen with Glasnost in the Soviet Union a decade ago, as well as in China and Vietnam today. 444 As capitalis m evolves, the presence of private actors and private responsibility opens the door for the application of environmental law both through economic sanctions and incentives, and the ul - timate trump card, injunctions. It also brings with it tremendous press ures for unsustainable development and consumption that have swept Latin America and, indeed, the world. 445 Whether environ - ________________________________ ________________________ 442.

XI. P OLITICS A ND LAW It is necessary to implement the exercise of the right to a healthy environment that guides the Law, and of other rights associated with this, as the right to infor - mation, and the right to participate in decision - making processes. It implies a nec essity to revise some legal texts . . . and it is worth noting that in other countries the solution has risen to the constitutional level, by means of the introduction of certain citizens' actions in the Fundamental Law. 446 Orlando Rey Santos, CITMA Envir onmental law confronts politics every day of its life. No country is free from political influence over environmental decision - making, and even the United States has seen public employees censured, transferred and fired outright for having taken an \"en - vironmental\" stand. 447 Members of the United States Congress regularly pressure environmental agency personnel with budget and personal reprisals for infringing on pet projects within their dis - tricts, 448 and for much of the 1980's both the President and his cabinet openly opposed the very environmental laws that, under the Constitution and numerous federal statutes, 449 they were charged with carrying out. The interface between politics and environmental protection is even more precarious in Latin America, where environmental leaders have been physically harassed, charged with treason and even killed, 450 and where the employment of someone opposing a government -favored project may be equally short -lived. ________________________________ ________________________ looting of natural reso urces in the former Soviet Union.

[Vol. 16.1 It is not sufficient, therefore, to simply note that politic s will play a strong role in Cuban environmental policy, because this is true in every country. What is different in Cuba is the monolithic strength of politics, coupled with the shortage of those elements, found in at least rudimentary form elsewhere in the Americas, that serve to keep outright and unlawful political influence in check. The most important of these controlling elements include free press, multi - party politics, nongovernmental organizations, and a rule of law. In Cuba, such institutional safeguards are limited by a philosophy at the core of the Cuban Constitution that the govern - ment is the people, its organs are those of the people, and thus other institutions are superfluous. 451 There is no need to check -and- balance a system that is of th e people and working only for the public good. The concomitant limitations, particularly on press and politics, are reinforced by Cuba's perception that it is on the re - ceiving end of an economic, political, and, at times, armed war from the United States , legitimizing the suppression of dissent. 452 As na\u00efve as Cuba's view of governance may appear in the abstract, it certainly finds parallels in the positions of agency heads and industry magnates in all countries, convinced that they know what is best for t he nation and that no further inquiry is necessary. Envi - ronmental law challenges that mindset frontally, from its requirements for environmental impact analysis on up the chain. The question in Cuba is the extent to which environmental law will affect i ts system of governance, already reacting to the strains of free market initiatives and the uncertainties of a post -Fidel Castro world. Perhaps the first notion to clarify is the extent of the Cuban monolith. In political life the authority of the Comm unist Party is apparently total, but government life proceeds in much the same fractious, internecine, argumentative and compromising way that characterizes all governments. Where enactments of environmental law are concerned, the best evidence is that in teractions among government personnel and institutions are freewheeling and pro - duce significant changes in original proposals. 453 Ultimately, con - frontations over major policy issues or particularly controversial ________________________________ ________________________ MEDIO AMBIENTE Y TRABAJO , Mar. 1999 (honoring the memory of Chico Mendez, who fought for agrarian and environmental reform, and who was assassinated on December 22, 1998). 451.

Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 71 permits may indeed be settled by the Commun ist Party and outside of the government box. 454 However, if the lawmaking and implementation record described earlier in this article is any measure, there is a considerable free -fire zone within Cuban government on environmental decision -making. With this understanding, the elements of society and governance important to, and most likely to be affected by, Cuban environmental law are non - governmental organizations and administrative and public law. A. Non -governmental Organizations At least three kinds of non -governmental organizations are found in Cuba. The first to emerge, from the outset of the revolutionary government, were the mass organizations of popular power: the Organization of Cuban Trade Unions, the Federation of Cuban Women, and National A ssociation of Small Farmers, separate organizations for students at the secondary school and university level, and local Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs). 455 These organizations were conceived of as a way of infusing public opinion into d ecision making, controlled by a close but informal relationship with the Communist Party. As noted earlier, they were explicitly authorized in the Constitution of 1976 and were granted significant rights, including that of proposing and reviewing proposed legislation. 456 Membership in these organizations, while not mandatory, may have significant personal and professional consequences. 457 The organizations with the most direct relationship to the environment are the CDRs, which have evolved from an original role in civil defense -cum-loyalty police to include significant social work at the local level, such as literacy campaigns, public health and immunization, and environmental education and reforestation. 458 While the connection of these groups to government precludes any expectation of their becoming an independent voice for environmental protection, they do constitute vehicles for environmental education and the implementation of government environmental policy at the grassroots level. ________________________________ ________________________ 454.

[Vol. 16.1 A second set of group s is rooted in Cuba's deep tradition in the sciences and the association of these scientists in government research centers and institutes across the country. Several of these organizations, such as the Cuban Speleological Society, long pre - dated the revo lution and others, like the National Academy of Sciences, were launched by revolutionary leaders from academia. 459 They operate with official sanction, but on their own initiatives and resources. The Cuban Zoological Society, by way of illustration, has its own budget, elects its own officers and directors, sets its own pro - gram, and holds well -attended, annual symposia on a wide range of environmental issues, some highly technical, others involving research with findings critical of specific government pro posals and programs. 460 The orientation of at least some of these societies is frankly environmental. In fact, the motto of the Cuban Zoological Society is \"[t]o preserve the collections of natural history, an ob - ligation for future generations.\" 461 In the aggregate, these societies provide a separate base of highly informed citizens involved in environmental issues and organized with at least functional inde - pendence from the Cuban government.

As of 1994, approximately 2 ,200 NGOs were registered in Cuba, ranging from the mass organizations of popular power, to the Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba, to ProNaturaleza. Cuban Law 54, promulgated in 1985 on \"Associations and their Regulation\" requires NGOs to register a statement of goals and organizational structure; list the names of at least thirty members and the names and addresses of its leadership; demonstrate that it will be self -financing and the absence of an NGO with the same purpose; and obtain the sponsorship o f a \"state reference institution,\" with the right to attend meetings and impact the organization's records.

ProNaturaleza claims 5,000 members in Cuba, with chapters in each of the 14 provinces. 466 It is the closest organization in Cuba to an environmental wat chdog, lobbying on legislation, organizing action -oriented conferences, re - porting violations of laws, and at times, directly opposing government proposals, with some reported success. 467 The Foundation for Nature and Man is not a membership organization in the same sense; it is rather an organization with some twenty -six employees located in Havana and six regional cities dedicated to specific environmental projects and to the publication of a national newsletter. 468 The Foundation's projects include urban g ardens and greenspace, watershed planning, improved agricultural practices and action -alerts on current issues. Originally funded from the estate of Antonio Nunez, the Foundation receives additional revenue from publications and from foundations in Canada , Italy and other countries.

[Vol. 16.1 emerged, worldwide, as an indi spensable ingredient to successful environmental policy. One cannot overstate the importance of these groups in public education; environmental permitting, monitoring and compliance; dialogue with government and industry; media in - formation; and daily vig ilance. One of CITMA's challenges will be to break itself from the insular traditions of a bureaucracy and develop these groups as active constituencies, even at the pain of their criticism and dissatisfaction with the pace of progress and with particular agency decisions. 469 This same challenge is of course faced by environmental agencies in Louisiana and elsewhere, not always with good humor or success. B. Administrative and Public Law In fact, the recognition of a right to a healthy en - vironment, open s the door to legal actions for environmental harm, even without the plaintiff having received direct injury to his person or property, including the undertaking of collective actions. 470 Orlando Rey, CITMA Consider the implications of this statement. If there is a challenge greater than involving citizens and the general public in environmental decision -making, it is the empowerment of these groups in law. The world of 2000 is full of vigorous -sounding en - vironmental laws, many of which are not put into practice in more than a perfunctory manner. The great innovation of environmental law in the United States was not only its substance, which by now has been mirrored in most countries, but also its process: public access to information, public participat ion in decision -making, and judicial review. If the relative strength of environmental organiza - tions is one good indicator of the success of environmental policy in any given jurisdiction, then the presence or absence of these admin - istrative processes i s an equally good one. ________________________________ ________________________ 469.

See Profile, supra note 29, at 46. Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 75 Day-to-day environmental decision making is administrative: the scope and adequacy of environmental analysis, for example, emissions standards for a discharge permit, observance of a set -back line from coastal vegetation, or acces s to a biological reserve. These are not decisions of legislators but of agency employees who are under heavy pressure from applicants, other agencies and at times their own superiors to expedite the approvals, downplay adverse impacts, and cut a deal. T hey operate under the shadow of knowing, further, that any decision adverse to a private interest can be, and probably will be, administratively and judicially appealed. Bad environmental decisions are not made by bad people; they are made by people seeki ng to appease their superiors and stay out of trouble. One successful way to offset these otherwise overwhelming pressures has been to empower environmentalists as a counter -force. This empowerment begins with legal requirements for public notice, inform ation, and genuine participation in decision -making. It ends with the most sensitive subject of all: judicial review. The process is new to Cuba. The Cuban Constitution, as noted earlier, requires the state to protect the environment and contribute to the \"achievement of sustainable development,\" and declares it to be the duty of citizens to contribute to this protection. Article 4 of Law 81 interprets sustainable development to mean that the state \"establish and facilitate the necessary means and guar antees to pro - tect the right to a sound environment in an adequate and timely manner\"; 471 that these obligations \"constitute a responsibility of all national and local state agencies and bodies within their juris - diction\"; 472 that \"every person must have adequ ate access, in conformance with established legal requirements, to all available information in the possession of state agencies and bodies regarding the environment\"; 473 that \"public knowledge of environmental actions and decisions and consultation with the public will be assured in the best manner possible, but in every case must occur\"; 474 and that \" every natural or legal person, as authorized by law, must have adequate and sufficient access to administrative or judicial means to demand compliance with this Law,\" and with subsequent, implementing laws. 475 ________________________________ ________________________ 471.

[Vol. 16.1 On their face, the scope and lack of ambiguity in these provisions would be impressive for any law. For Cuba, the right to all governmental environmental information (and nearly all environ - mental informatio n in Cuba is governmental); the right to know of government actions in advance and to be consulted on them; and most of all, the right to access administrative and judicial bodies to demand compliance with law is revolutionary. 476 If, and this is a huge \"if ,\" it can be enforced. The inquiry now reaches the unknown: the extent to which Law 81 and its daughter laws will open up the administrative and judicial process to review of agency decision making. The first part of this inquiry is whether Cuban civil courts have the jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of government environmental decisions. The Cuban Code of Civil Procedure, 477 similar to the codes of many countries and the Administrative Procedure Act of the United States, 478 expressly provides for judi cial review of actions that are final and when administrative remedies have been exhausted. The Code proceeds to list certain subjects as exempt from judicial review, but environmental issues, \u2014 perhaps, felicitously, because they post -date the Code \u2014 are not listed. 479 A literal reading of the Code, then, would recognize a right of judicial review. The second half of the inquiry is to understand exactly who may exercise this right, the question of \"standing to sue.\" Traditionally, an industry denied an e nvironmental license or an individual who's property was harmed by its issuance would have the requisite interest. Not so certain are the interests of those individuals and or - ganizations that seek to prevent environmental injury in the future, from an al legedly unlawful government act. The scope and nature of the injury necessary for standing to sue is, in all countries, one of the hottest topics in administrative en - vironmental law. It can be said with some confidence, however, that from jurisprudenc e historically narrow in confining these interests to those suffering financial or physical injury, both Latin American and European civil code jurisdictions are trending rapidly towards the acceptance of expanded standing, in some cases more expansive ________________________________ ________________________ 476.

LAND USE & ENVTL. L. [Vol. 16.1 and restoration of environmental harm already done, or whether they will limit relief for harm anticipated from governmental actions such as inadequate impact analyses, permits that exceed regulatory requirements, or violations of public law. One way to read Article 71 is that it intends to exclude this re lief for private plaintiffs. An opposite interpretation is that Article 71, by its very title, speaks only to civil liability, that is to say to damages and restoration, and not to review of prospective harm. This latter interpretation is supported by th e unambiguous statement in Article 4, that every person \"must have adequate access to administrative and judicial means\" to demand compliance with this and other environmental laws. 488 Under this view, Law 81 limits private monetary relief for past harm, but Law 81 does not limit, indeed it guarantees, judicial review to enforce compliance with law. The resolution to this important question may be years in the making. It was certainly years in the making in the United States, which only opened its courts to citizen enforcement of public law in the 1960's, 489 and to expanded citizen standing in the 1970's. 490 As discussed earlier, CITMA has seen fit to provide administrative review of its environmental impact and licensing decisions within the agency on behal f of the applicant, but has yet to confer the same right on citizen groups; 491 it has further deferred its required regulations for public participation to later rulemaking. 492 On the other hand, neither door is closed and the Director of CITMA's Office of En vironmental Policy is on record as recognizing the need to implement the exercise of these public rights. 493 Meanwhile, as also discussed earlier, Cuba has created special tribunals to provide judicial review for economic and environmental cases. 494 Whether and how CITMA goes forward to provide administrative review for public organizations, and whether the courts will accept review and participation in appeals from these organizations, will go a long way to test Cuba's commitment to the implementation of its new ________________________________ ________________________ 488.

Many governments view public participation as a threat, limit access to environmental in - formation, and provide little or no judicial recourse. One might have thought that Cuba would lead this pack. It may not, and the shape of Cuban decision -making will change to the extent it adopts more expansive concepts of administrative environmental law. There is still the Party, but now there are also the courts and the seeds of a rule of law. Though it has not happened yet, Law 81 and its daughters open the door to these potentially large consequences. XII. C ONCLUSION The simple truth is that a free flow of American goods is more likely to rout communism in Cuba than the same strategy in China .... The island is so small and so close t hat Castro's regime would be unlikely to withstand a full frontal assault from American culture and consumer goods. Mickey Mouse and McDonald's are among the most powerful weapons in America's arsenal. Let's send them in. 496 Cynthia Tucker Cuba has made a commitment to environmental protection. It has begun to effectuate this commitment through law. The laws are incomplete and the mechanisms to implement them more so, but they are irrefutably under way. ________________________________ ________________________ 495. To be sure, expanded rights of public participation and judicial review are no guarantee of decisions favoring environmental protection or the sustainable use of natural resources. The general public in Cuba, much as the general public in Louisiana, for example, may care little about environmental protection or sustainability. Judicial review may, too, turn hostile to environmental protection even when this protection is mandated by public laws. See Oliver A. Houck, Environmental Law and the General Welfare , 16 PACE L. REV. 1 (1998) (describing \"deconstruction\" of environmental law by recent federal court decisions). These results will be all the more likely in countries with no tradition of citizen participation or an independent judiciary, or those that offer administrative and judicial review exclusively to economic interest s. Unless the scales of public law are balanced, they do not work. See id. 496. Cynthia Tucker, Mickey Mouse Will Bring Castro Down , THE TIMES PICAYUNE , June 1, 2000, at B -7. 80 J. LAND USE & ENVTL. L. [Vol. 16.1 The emerging laws may not comport with United St ates standards, but the incredible geometry of the Clean Air Act and the high -powered warfare conducted over proposed environmental regulation in the United States and Europe are not necessarily the Gold Standard for all nations to follow. Further, it may be just a little presumptuous for the United States, whose practices of resource consumption and waste lead the world, to sit in judgment on the efforts of any other country towards sustainable development. Cuba's laws may fail, but they may also lead to practices that have a far more balanced impact on the earth than those of their neighbors. It is too early to say. What may be surprising, or even be believed, is that the Cuban government would undertake such a journey in such severely difficult econom ic times. A large and experienced cadre of scientists in Cuba has been driving in this direction for decades, and it has caught the imagination of the Cuban leadership. The movement may prove to be transitory, though the idea of caring for the land goes back at least to the days of Jose Marti. The revolutionary government of 1959 and its mega -programs paid little heed to the environment, but neither did the programs of any country until very recent years, and the state -owned system of Cuban enterprise h as been changing rapidly since 1992. The move - ment may prove to be illusory, as are the environmental programs of many countries, but as of this date there is no reason yet to conclude that it will. The best evidence indicates that the responsible agency , CITMA, is in there trying, accompanied by a fair measure of political support, while other ministries and institutions are coming on board. The immediate next question is the implementation of this new body of law, which will require more law and more c hanges than perhaps were originally contemplated or bargained for. These measures include enforcement and incentives, as well as two, time - proven ingredients for effective environmental policy: public participation and independent judicial review. If, a nd as, they emerge, these measures could create new modes of decision -making and a rule of law. This outcome is by no means assured, but it is a very real possibility. In the future, and perhaps even the near future, Mickey Mouse is sure to arrive, bring ing with him the aptly predicted \"full frontal assault\" of American culture and consumer goods. At that point, the presence of a functioning system of environmental protection supported by an involved public and effective public law will be critical. Lea dership, funding and political support for CITMA will be Fall, 2000] ENVIRONMENTA L LAW IN CUBA 81 no more a given in the future Cuba than they are for the Environ - mental Protection Agency in the United States. The money for exploiting anything of value in any fashion will be enormous. How - ever far away that day is, Cuba has just that much time to get its environmental act together, and little more. 82 J.
