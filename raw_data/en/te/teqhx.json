The projects highlighted here, although not exhaustive, docum ent the history a nd nature of this longstanding relationship. A section on student and alum ni case studies offers additional insight into the other aspects and breadth of this collaboration. The value of pa rtnerships between academ ic and public service institutions clearly resonated through interviews with students, faculty, and com munity health practitioners in the public sector. Positive outco mes on program evaluations of com munity-based initiatives, form ulated and conducted jointly by the SPH and DPH, further illustrate the m any benefits of joining forces. Collaboratives th at actively engage academ ics, public service practitioners, and com munity residents of ten boast a great deal of sustainability. Additionally, these partnerships cultivate leadership and team work skills essential f or propelling students into future public health leadership roles. 3 I. INTRODUCTION The efficacy of partnerships between academ ic and public service health institutions is clearly illustrated in the series of collaborativ e projects between the Lom a Linda University School of Public Health (SPH) and the San Be rnardino County Departm ent of Public Health (DPH). In addition to the deve lopm ent of a research- and action-based discourse around disease prevention, assessm ent, and education, the SPH and DPH have m odeled the essence of partnerships in public health research by basi ng their work on com munity change and awareness building. In the 1980's, with the im plem entation of national Prevention Research Centers that would m erge public health research with direct com munity interests, the call f or alliances between public service and academ ic institutions was im perative. This paradigm shift from isolated think tanks to joint, m ulti-layered collabor atives ef fectively paired education with f ield practice. By integrating research and teaching w ith m ainstream public service, practitioners and academ ics alike could proffer an efficient, acti on- and solution-oriented m ethod of confronting health concerns am ong specific com munities.1 The recent m odel of \"healthy citizen, healt hy com munity\" bears heavily on the concept of multi-level com munal change, in its facilitation of dialogue and shared decision-m aking authority among stakeholders in the com munity, academ ia, and public service. This is a m odel with obvious benefits to all parties involved; both public service and academ ic institutions have a great deal of knowledge to share with each other. P ublic service institutions like the DPH have access to the health status of com munities and jurisdiction over target populations. They are continually monitoring data and activity about disease rates, prevalence, incidence, m ortality, and m orbidity. In addition, they have the resources and experi ence to provide superior program evaluation and implem entation. Academ ic institutions like the SPH can provide inform ed m ethodologies and complex intervention recom mendations based on thei r research. They also have the ability to conduct further investigations to determ ine the grounds for specific com munity health trends and techniques to successfully address these trends. Finally, com munity involvem ent ensures a larger overall awareness of the health issues that a ffect various populations; it not only enables sm ooth facilitation of dialogue and action with public serv ice and academ ic institutions, but it also offers an opportunity for sustainable social change by those populations directly affected by the work. 1 A report published by the Institute of Medicine in 1988, entitled The Future of Public Hea lth, pointed to this 4 The ownership granted to SPH students is especially operative in the collaboration m odel, which establishes foundational leadership skills fo r all involved parties. In collaboration with various projects funded by the DPH and research carried out in connection with the DPH, students have industriously participated in intern ships, professor-led research, com munity health initiatives, and the developm ent of field practica and dissertations. Many of these projects have resulted in em ploym ent with the DPH, thus ensuring a highly trained, knowledgeable, and methodologically adept crop of future leaders. With projects ranging from diabetes preventi on to child saf ety awareness to addressing health disparities am ong underserved com munities, SPH students and faculty have team ed up with the DPH and organized everything from the compilation and evaluation of data to securing continued funding. The skills and experien ces gleaned by SPH students\u2014grantwriting, community m entoring, collaborative learning, shari ng findings at esteem ed events such as the annual Am erican Public Health Association (AP HA) conference, being published in prestigious scientif ic journals, and adm inistering and im plem enting com munity health initiatives f rom start to finish, to nam e a few\u2014are dem onstrated in the case studies below. 5 coalitio n model as a b est practice. II. COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS A. Academic Health The anthology of projects em bodied in this doc ument was borne out of a concerted effort between the SPH and DPH to overcom e lim itations in achieving a m utually beneficial and sustainable relationship between the two agenci es. These previously identified obstacles included: 1) the absence of a form al system of engagem ent between the SPH and DPH, 2) insufficient m onetary support for student involve ment, and 3) the absence of record keeping which articulate the findings, recom mendations, and lessons learned from joint efforts. SPH and DPH staff im plem ented proactive m easures in each dom ain of concern, which consisted of the construction of a form al system of engagem ent to facilitate cooperation and collaboration between the DPH and SPH, as well as the es tablishm ent of four funded 10-week MPH internships, one 40-week DrPH research project , and a labor pool of 300 student hours allocated as requested by the DPH. Since funding was procured, Ja mes Felton, County DPH Adm inistrator and Juan Carlos Belliard, SPH faculty, attended a m eeting sponsor ed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on August 27 of 2004 to inform the CDC of the nature of the relationship and activities associated with the SPH-DPH partnershi p, and to possibly garner support for additional funding. i. Families Fighting Diabetes Latino residents of San Bernardino County ha ve exceptionally high rates of diabetes- related m ortality and m orbidity. Despite a num ber of program s set up to address the prevention and control of diabetes, m any Latinos face a num ber of barriers to these services. For instance, Latinos encounter greater lim itations to accessing ex isting services, such as lack of knowledge of their options and available resources in the community. The goal of the Fam ilies Fighting Diabetes project was to establish ongoing collabor ations between the com munity and the DPH to create a com munity-driven program centered on diab etes education and prevention/control. This joint venture was carried out over a six-m onth period in three distinct phases, ending in Septem ber, 2004. Catherine Oliveros, MPH a doctoral student in Preventive Care at the SPH, was the program 's coordinator, and worked under the supe rvision of DPH Chief of Disease Control and 6 Prevention and Interim Health Officer for the Sa n Bernardino County of Departm ent of Public Health, Eric Frykm an, MD, MPH, MBA. The proj ect was designed to further assess the County's composition and determ ine where San Bernardino County residents are in term s of diabetes incidence, knowledge, and behavioral lifestyle practices. The DPH, through Lom a Linda University, provided technical and educational support for the training of com munity m embers and, in collaboration with the Hom e of Neighbor ly Services, set up a resource and educational program open to com munity m embers. In Phase One of the Fam ilies Fighting Di abetes project, program staf f com piled qualitative data on San Bernardino's Latino co mmunity through baseline surveys and focus groups designed to assess diabetes knowledge, we llness, preventive practices, and barriers to such. During Phase Two, data obtained from the qualitative analysis provided the County with insight necessary to understand their residents and develop an approach that was culturally appropriate and com munity-centered. Phase Thr ee involved the im plem entation of a com munity- based intervention intended to im prove the lives of people with diabetes and aggressively educate the com munity on risk factors and behaviors that are key for prevention. ii. Mentoring Pregnant and Parenting Teens Recent studies have explored the specific relationship between new adolescent m others and postpartum depression in an attem pt to determ ine whether this age group is at an increased risk f or mental illness when com pared to their older m others. Research indicates that adolescent parenting m ay motivate som e young m others to im prove their lifestyles, while for others it m ay create stress and depression. Frequently agreed upon associations with adolescent pregnancy are abandonm ent, feeling unprepared to be a parent, isolation, and rejection. Adolescent girls who becom e pregnant before they reach their full potential height usually becom e stunted. Due to the rapid growth changes that naturally occur in fem ales during adolescence, the fetus usually becom es malnourished because the m other's body cannot adequately m obilize fat. The fetus also depletes specific m aternal nutrient supplies and stores such as iron and calcium respectively. It is because of these health com plications that adolescent pregnancy is a m ajor m aternal and child health concerns, both nationally and internationally. For her field practicum , Mildred Leatham , MPH, CHES, served as the Program Planner and developed a grant proposal to fund a m entoring program for pregnant and parenting teens under the direction of Linda Levisen, R.N., M. S., Section Manager of the Perinatal and 7 Adolescent Life Section (PALS). Increasing social support can help identify and decrease the occurrence of postpartum depression am ong parenting adolescents. However, th e current literature indicate a lack of social support program s that specifically em ploy m entorship to pregnant and parenting teens as a m eans for decreasing the occurrence of postpartum depression am ong this population. As a result, Leatham 's field practicum looked to develop a pr ogram that applies m entorship as a m eans for increasing social support to pregnant and parenting teens in the local com munity. iii. Food Security Program In January of 2004, Jacob Shellm an, a Maste r's level student, initiated the process of establishing a food security program in concer t with the DPH Nutrition program . Shellm an engaged in com munity trust-building activities with m embers of the International Neighborhood Cluster Association, conducted a prelim inary asse t assessm ent, and solicited training interests among group m embers. The Association expressed a strong interest in exploring supplem ental incom e sources, particularly through sales of hom e-produced goods, ranging from cakes to hom e garden produce. Shellm an will begin exploring lega l issues of this venture, such as acquiring a business license, and assisting the group m embers in identifying the physical resources. iv. Food Facilities Risk-based Inspection System Under the guidance of Corwin Porter, MPH, Michelle Hoag, a Master's student, is developing a risk-based inspection system for food facilities for the DPH Environm ental Health Division. The inspection of food facilities is a crucial public service to prevent foodborne illnesses am ong consum ers of retail food. A desire to im prove the food inspection program in San Bernardino County has led to research concer ning risk-based food inspection program s. This research sought to determ ine how various jurisd ictions incorporate risk in their food facility inspection program s and led to the developm ent of a risk-based food inspection program in which food facilities are categorized into high, m odera te, and low risk groupings. Food facilities are placed in a risk category based on food property ri sks, population at risk, food facility history, and food facility operational risks. The risk categor ization of food facilities then allows for the determ ination of the frequency of inspections and perm it fee schedules for food facilities based on their placem ent into a risk category. 8 The risk-based food inspection program may be applied by various jurisdictions interested in addressing risk in their food safety program or wishing to update their program . Risk can be gauged by several com ponents of the risk-bas ed food inspection program . The developed program includes a risk assessm ent form that allo ws jurisdictions to place the food facilities in categories based on risk level. Other aspects of the program include the determ ination of the frequency of inspection as well as determ ining the perm it fee schedule for food facilities. v. Norton Neighborhood Nutrition Network (NNNN) The goal of the Norton Neighborhood Nutrition Network (NNNN) is to prevent nutrition related chronic diseases in Spanish-speaking wom en with children attending schools within the San Bernardino Joint Unified School District. In conjunction with com munity m embers, Jeanne Silberstein, MPH, RD, and Sonia J. Vega, and E ddy Jara, MPH, RD, of the DPH Public Health Nutrition Program , identified the behavioral obj ective for a 2003 cam paign of increasing dietary consum ption of vegetables by one serving per day. Participatory form ative research was conducted to identify cam paign strategies, m essage, and m aterials that were later piloted with members of the target audience. The l ead agency, core group and advocates, or promotoras, dissem inated m essages prom oting vegetable cons umption through m ultiple channels, conducted a series of workshops that included nutrition e ducation and vegetable gardening, and facilitated changes in school policy. Cam paign evaluation consisted of pre and post intercept surveys, case studies and activity docum entation, which revealed an increase in the target behavior and success in identifying policy change goals. In 2004, Silberstein and Vega later guided th e NNNN in applying a program -planning m odel, the Spectrum of Prevention, to em power Latino m others in this low-incom e prim arily Spanish- speaking neighborhood to change the school envir onment and social norm s around foods offered to im prove health by im pacting policies drivi ng food choices in schools. The Spectrum of Prevention includes: strengthening individua l knowledge, prom oting com munity education, training/educating providers, f ostering coalitions and networks, changing organizational practices, and influencing policy and legislation. The m others who had been attending parenting, ESL, nutrition and gardening classes sponsored by the district and public health increased their awareness, knowledge and skills about the benefits of growing, preparing and serving nutritious foods to their fam ilies at hom e. Flushed with the success experienced at hom e in m aking these changes, the m others discerned a disconnect between what was taught to them in class and what 9 was served at their parent m eetings and in the school cafeteria. The Latino m oms becam e advocates of healthy eating and physical activity prom otion at the school. They advocated for the adoption of the Healthy Food Option Policy, which infl uenced what is served at parent m eetings and sold by the PTA for fundraisers. The Lati no m oms held the principal accountable to following through on the policy. As a result a decisi on to sell an alternative item instead of candy for the annual school fundraiser was m ade by the pr incipal. Lastly, the Latino m others organized and advocated for the establishm ent of a salad ba r at their children's elem entary school despite barriers of space and labor. B. Healthy Communities Together In 1995, the California W ellness Foundation aw arded a total of $404,000 over a three-year period to the SPH. The funding was granted to de liver a program to the underserved com munity surrounding Lom a Linda University. The progr am was coordinated by Patti Herring, PhD, RN, Professor of Health Prom otion and Education at the SPH. She was assisted by Cherry Patulot, a Master's degree candidate of Public Health w ithin the Departm ent of Health Prom otion and Education, along with m any other faculty and st udents from the SPH. The titles of the four components were: Recipes for a Healthy Fam ily; Healthy W omen in Motion; The Healthy Heart Hispanic Cook Book project; and Sm art Moves. Recipes for a Healthy Fam ily was headed by Juan Carlos Belliard, PhD, MPH, Assistant Prof essor of International Health and Director of Students for International Mission Services (SIMS) , with the assistance of students from the schools of nursing, dentistry, soci al work, and public health. The goal of the program was to improve the quality of life for the entire com munity; participants received support and guidance to em power them with sharp decision-m aking sk ills, which they can practice to im prove their families' health and wellness. The three other program s are described below: 10 i. The Healthy Women in Motion Program The Healthy W omen in Motion Program provided a ten-week exercise unit with Latin music and various incentives (e.g.- free shoes, gym socks, redem ption vouchers for other California W ellness grant-sponsored activities, heath screenings, and m edical referrals), located at the SAC-Norton Clinic and directed by com munity resident Deeya Sm ith. During its initial phases, the program prim arily targeted the Span ish-speaking residents in San Bernardino County Norton neighborhoods. However, over tim e and de velopm ent of the program , the nam e was changed from \"Hispanic Aerobi cs Class and Hispanic Music Aerobic Exercise Program \" to \"Healthy W omen in Motion,\" to include every fem ale resident of the com munity without being ethnically exclusive. The change in nam e had a positive outcom e, increasing attendance and morale am ong participants and creating an atm osphere of solidarity and enjoym ent, as well as building a stronger com munity. In addition to the change in the program 's na me, there were also changes in leadership. The planning phase was directed by Herring, who recruited Master's level candidates in Public Health to conduct com prehensive needs asse ssments and Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) surveys before establishing guidelines a nd policies for the program . The im plem entation portion of the program was first directed by Ma rianne Torchia-Mason, MPH, who also adopted the role of aerobics class instructor; and later, by Michele Can W ormer, MPH. Three com munity m embers who started as partic ipants in the exercise classes volunteered to join an aerobics training program in order to conduct their own classes, which encouraged the vital need for com munity involvem ent and leadersh ip and would provide future sustainability for the program . This program has docum ented m uch success, showing the positive im pact the program has had on the participants. There has been increased health-related knowledge and self-esteem , weight loss, the developm ent of new friendships and support networks, and a high turnout of new participants at the end of every session. ii. The Healthy Healing Hispanic Cook Book The Healthy Healing Hispanic Cook Book was an idea introduced by Maxim o A. Mejia, DrPH, MA, a Seventh-Day Adventis t pastor who wanted to share knowledge regarding diet and its effects on health, and provide people with necessary inform ation about nutrition and cooking skills. W ith generous funding and support from the California W ellness Foundation and m any 11 colleagues at Lom a Linda University, Dr. Mejia becam e a nutrition and cooking instructor in the Hispanic com munity. He shared m any culturally appropriate recipes that included ingredients and preparation styles fam iliar to the population he was serving. Dr. Mejia developed a training curriculum and conducted training sem inars for Hi spanic peer nutrition instructors within the community so that they, in turn, could train others in their church or com munity-based groups. The goals of the program were to em power the volunteer team to develop a culturally relevant cookbook; prepare healthy and cultura lly acceptable foods and reach out to their communities with nutrition education to reduce the incidence of preventable nutrition-related diseases. Due to its success in recruitm ent, the program far surpassed its goal of training 20 peer nutrition educators and now has 42 graduates and continues to generate interest from new participants at the end of every session. The Healthy Healing Hispanic Cook B ook continuously undergoes revisions by a committee of peer nutrition instructors represen ting 12 Latin Am erican countries, a num ber of islands in the Caribbean, and the United States. Th e final edition will com prise a key tool used by trainers to prom ote nutrition and healthy eating in targeted com munities. iii. Smart Moves Smart Moves is a f ree program that of fers weekly activities, nutrition guidance, and weight m anagem ent. The program draws on the increased distress around childhood obesity and the decrease in the nutritional status of childre n. These dilem mas drew Ella Hasso-Haddad, DrPH, Associate Professor in the SPH Nutrition Depart ment, to becom e involved in the Sm art Moves program to offer her extensive experience in the prim ary prevention of childhood obesity and research on dietary fats and obesity. . The adolescent weight loss program is fr ee of charge and offered by Lom a Linda University's Nutrition Departm ent and the San Bernardino County Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) division of the DPH.2 The objectives of the program are to increase nutritional status by consum ing fruits and vege tables and low-fat or non-fat m ilk and foods; increase physical activity; increase self-esteem and self-m otivation; and offer instruction on m eal planning, eating on the go, self-control flexibility, healthy bodies, the im portance of breakfast, and taking pulse rates. There have been m any benefits in im plem enting the program for both adolescent participants as well as Master's candida tes in Public Health in the Nutrition and Health 12 Prom otion and Education departm ents. Due to the success of the program , a new com ponent was added, providing individual intervention and counseling to youth and their parents. C. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Geographic Inform ation System s (GIS) is a cutting edge technology that's widely applicable to the im provem ent of public health practices. GIS is an agglom eration of com puter hardware and software that is used to store, update, analyze, display, and m anipulate all form s of geographic location. Typically used for representing maps as layers of data that can be studied and used for perform ing analyses, GIS has beco me a m ajor com ponent of progressive public health practices. Because it offers a sim plified m eans of m anaging spatial inform ation on habitats, resources, and the environm ent, it is an ex cellent tool for developm ent planning and environm ental m onitoring. In the context of public health practices, GIS offers an efficient method of collecting and presenting data on large populations, how they live, who they are, and what their health needs m ay be. The ultim ate goa l of collecting such data is f inding optim al solutions for public health problem s in the com munities under exam ination. The SPH has recognized the need for building a com prehensive program for this widely growing technology, and is the only school in the nation to offer a Bachelor of Science degree of public health in Health Geographics.3 The program is m eant to introduce the benef its of GIS to both health practitioners and those who are still in training. Samuel Soret, PhD, is director of the GI S Program s, whose research has involved the application of spatial analysis and GIS technol ogy in public and environm ental health, nam ely with the GIS regional m odeling of air pollutants and the spatial analysis of infant mortality rates using GIS technology. His other role s at LLU include Assistant Prof essor at the School of Public Health and Assistant Professor in preventive m edicine at the Lom a Linda School of Medicine. His research interests include the application of spatial analysis and GIS technology in public and environm ental health, nam ely with the GIS regi onal m odeling of air pollutants, and the spatial analysis of infant m ortality rates using GIS t echnology. Soret shared som e of his expertise on the place of technology in public health when he serv ed as one of four f eatured panelists for a continuing education course in 2000 entitled \"GIS in Public Health: Using Mapping and Spatial 2 It has been i mplemented at the SAC -Norton C linic and l ocal publ ic school s, targeting youth ages 13-17. 3 The school recently added a certificate in Health Geoinform atics in addition to a new learning lab that will be used 13 Analysis Technologies for Health Protection.\" The course was beam ed by satellite and co- sponsored by the CDC and the Agency for Toxi c Substances and Disease Registry. Courses currently taught by Soret include Geographical Techniques for Health and Environm ental Analysis (ENVH 557), Outdoor Air Quality and Hum an Health (ENVH 566), and GIS in Public and Environm ental Health (ENVH 437). Seth W iafe, MPH, is an alum nus of the SPH and instructor of several GIS courses, including Principles of GIS (ENVH 422/522), GIS Technol ogy and Methods (ENVH 424/524), Practical Issues in GIS (E NVH 423/523), inar in Environm Wiafe's research interests in geoinform atics and related geographic analysis as applied to both public and environm ental health, coupled with hi s extensive GIS training, have helped the SPH stay abreast of such technological advances and valuable public health tools. A scholar who is accredited by the Am erican Council on Education for Public Health, W iafe also received his BS in Health Geographics from the SPH in 2002 before obtaining his MPH in Environm ental and Occupational Health, also from the SPH. Currently, W iafe holds a position as a Health and Hum an Services Solutions Analyst for the Environm ental System s Research Institu te (ESRI), the com pany that oversees the developm ent, testing, and distribution of GIS soft ware. Over the past years, he has introduced aspects of GIS at a host of nati onal and international conferences to enhance public health efforts in areas such as reducing the transm ission of HIV/AIDS in South Africa, and im proving the kidney transplantation program in the state of Ca lifornia. W iafe and Soret are currently involved in several projects together, which include constructing and m anaging the database for the African Am erican Health Initiative (AAHI) Hea lth Planning Project of San Bernardino County, and creating a GIS-based Spatial Decision-Ma king Support System (SDSS) for the High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control Dem onstration Project of San Bernardino County. Their highly specialized knowledge of GIS and dem onstrated expe rtise have m ade them particularly valuable in the process of seeking optim al com munity health solutions in the two projects described below: i. African American Health Initiative Health Planning Project of San Bernardino The African Am erican Health Initiative (AAH I) is a partnership of the DPH, the San 14 for teaching, research, and m eeting the growing needs of GIS throughout the cam pus. Bernardino County Medical Society, Inland Wellness Inform ation Network, and over 30 community-based organizations and individua ls in San Bernardino County com mitted to improving the health of African Am ericans. Th rough an active Advisory Council, these m embers form a network of coordinated health services and expertise to effectively address the health disparities am ong African Am ericans. The appro ach used by AAHI is one of collaboration am ong key stakeholders, representatives of the African American com munity, public and private m edical service providers, local governm ent, and the e ducation com munity, to develop and im plem ent long-term strategies that address specific gaps and needs within the health delivery system . Diane W oods, a Preventive Care doctoral candidate at the SPH, is the current director of AAHI. Dr. Herring of the SPH, Preventive Care doc toral student Tam arra Jones, MPH and Ron Graybill, MD, of the Lom a Linda University Me dical Center, are also active m embers of AAHI. Representatives serving on AAHI Advisory Counc il from the San Bernardino County Departm ent of Public Health include: Asuncion MPH, CHES, Teslyn Henry, Jacknik, Eric Frykm an, MD, MPH, MB A, Vanessa Long, RN, MSN, Joyce Moore, Joshua Olagunju, PhD, Jeanne Silberstein, Bruce Smith, MD, Jennifer Baptiste-Sm ith, MPA, Joan Sainthorse, Eugenia Turner, Bernadette Beltran, and Disep Obuge, MPH. Wiafe and intern Alicia Ibarra Martinez, MP C, of the SPH Departm ent of Environm ental and Occupational Health, were recently brought on board by m embers of the AAHI to assist in the com pletion of their database construction and m anagem ent. The task involves the creation and maintenance of a geodatabase designed to identif y all current prevention and treatm ent services, as well as program s and providers relative to heart disease, high blood pressure, breast and prostate cancers, and HIV/AIDS in San Bern ardino County. The geodatabase was built using datasets containing over 300 surveys, best practi ce recom mendations, healthcare providers in the County, dem ographic inform ation, and basem aps. Available data was consolidated into GIS. The first data batch of the project was r eceived in April, 2004, and included dem ographic inform ation and inform ation about attitudes, pr evention, perceptions and treatm ent, com munity resources, and patient satisfaction. The data was gathered from 20 cities in the county. Surveys from both key inform ants and healthcare providers , focus groups, resident interviews, and public forum s were com ponents of the data gather ing process. Key outcom es in the Database Construction and Managem ent also include system maintenance, the updating of protocols, and the creation of a CD containing the entire database. In Novem ber 2004, AAHI Director Diane W oods presented a paper entitled \"Com munity 15 Participatory Research: Building Social Ecologi cal or Healthier rocentric Com munities,\" which delineated the m ixed-m ethods approach that was utilized in the investigation of the healthcare delivery system in African Am erican com munities. Data analysis from GIS revealed that African Am ericans expr essed a desire to be active participants in healthcare decision-m aking; to have prevention pr ogram s that are respectful of personal choice; and to have culturally appropriate quality m edical treatm ent. As a result of this assessm ent, an Afrocentric countywide strategic plan was developed, which included recom mendations for policy change, and especially stressed the viability of com munity participatory health in creating effective healthcare strategies. ii. High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control Demonstration Through funding from The California Endowm ent, the High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control Dem onstration Project was develope d in 2001, in partnership with the California Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (CHDSP) Pr ogram of the State Departm ent of Health Services. The project was given $25,000 to conduc t a six-m onth planning project that would address San Bernardino County's high rate of heart disease and stroke. Risk factors around heart disease and stroke include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, tobacco use, and a sedentary lifestyle. From 1996 to 1998, San Bernardi no County suffered from the highest age-adjusted heart disease death rate in the state, at 279 deaths per 100,000 (the state rate is 210 deaths per 100,000). The data stirred concern am ong com munity groups and leaders, including the African Am erican Health Initiativ e (AAHI) and the Com munity Health Coalition (CHC) of San Bernardino County, who are significantly focused on the control and prevention of heart disease and high blood pressure. In partne rship with the CHC, the High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control Dem onstration Project wa s created. The project entailed the enhancem ent of existing educational program s, and also provided blood pressure screenings and services to low-incom e participants. The project was created to benefit the general public, but focused specifically on African Am ericans, Latinos, se nior citizens, and wom en, who all have a disproportionate prevalence of high blood pressure. Sam Soret, Seth W iafe, and GIS intern and International Health m ajor Chahn Chess consolidated inform ation on health resources in the County into a GIS system in February, 2002. The com pletion of this asset m apping was instrum ental to finding resources that would support 16 the Project. The GIS team met with the DPH Program Analysis and Statistics Division, the Com munity Health Coalition of San Bernardino County, the Evaluation & Research Unit of the SPH, and the San Bernardino Geographic Inform ation Managem ent System . With this extensive communication network, the GIS team was able to work in cooperation with various entities in order to m ake inform ed m apping decisions. At the end of February, 2002, the team presented a plan to the Com munity Health Coalition of San Bernardino County. The plan included the cr eation of a GIS-based Spatial Decision-Making Support System (SDSS), which would include t ools and data for m apping resources in the County. The system would also exam ine socio econom ic status, age, race/ethnicity, language, level of education, and populations at risk. In April 2003, the first of six planning pha se m eetings for the project's advisory committee took place. The 14 m embers of the advisory com mittee included the targeted populations. Mem bers issued from the DPH, AAHI, SPH, Inland Em pire Health Plan, community-based organizations, and faith-bas ed organizations. The m eetings ran through Decem ber 2003, resulting in a clear project agenda; best practices, presented by SPH scholar John Kelly, MD, MPH; and a literature review on h ealth intervention effectiveness am ong African Americans, presented by the AAHI. Throughout the m eetings, the com mittee invited guest speakers to present, and identified collabor ative partners in the County and beyond. The committee derived valuable inform ation fr om target populations through focus groups, community forum s, and surveys. In prom oting the awareness of high blood pressure, the committee participated in m eetings with va rious entities, including the Molina Healthcare Advisory Com mittee and the Health Collaboratives of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. From March to Novem ber, 2003, the GIS Com mittee, including W iafe; DPH public service em ployee Evelyn Trevino, MPH; and Dr. Eric Frykm an m et and identified cities that were suitable areas in which to im plem ent interventi on strategies\u2014prim arily for the African Am erican population. The Project also coordinated a form ative re search com mittee that provided valuable input toward developing a com munity health survey and content questions for focus groups and key informant interviews. W ith the assistance of Margie Akin, MD, f rom the Molina Healthcare Advisory Com mittee, 260 surveys were collected; and focus groups were conducted with the African Am erican and Latino populations. The im plem entation phase included: a high bl ood pressure coordinating team represented 17 by the African Am erican population and faith-based com munity; the purchase of m aterials, including the m ost recently updated guidelines for hypertension and pre-hypertension blood pressure levels; and an increase in doctors' offices and hospitals as a part of com munity outreach efforts to increase awareness of the program in the public eye. D. SAFE KIDS In an attem pt to reduce the num ber of preventable accidents suffered by San Bernardino County children (as evidenced in reports from 1999 and 2000), the DPH, Lom a Linda University Children's Medical Center SAFE KIDS Cam paign, the County's Children's Network, and the Inland Em pire SAFE KIDS Coalition, in cooperati on with other regional organizations, launched a \"SAFE KIDS Sum mer 2001\" program . In 1999, at least 591 children in the county suffered serious injuries or death. Each sum mer, nearly three m illion children are rushed to em ergency room s for serious injuries from traffic collisions , drownings, bicycle crashes, heat exposure, and other hazards. The cam paign attem pted to raise awar eness on a variety of children's safety issues, such as correct use of child car seats, bicycle helm et use, pedestrian safety, playground equipm ent safety, and drowning prevention. The cam paign was part of a national SAFE KIDS cam paign including the DPH and Lom a Linda University Children's Medical Center SAFE KIDS Coalition. Various SPH students completed their field practica in conjunction w ith their work for the County cam paign, which further enabled the strategic im plem entation of child protection program s in the com munity. Rhonda Lee, under the supervision of Connie Cunningham , RN, MS, developed the curriculum for the SAFE KIDS project by im plem enting a safety program in com munity schools from March to June, 1998. Nim a Abrahim -Zadel, also under Cunningham 's supervision, developed a program on safety education involving pr oper bicycle helm et use that was successfully conducted in various schools in the County. The work in Sa n Bernardino County has also extended to other counties. Most recently, Kim berley Patrick, the In land Em pire SAFE KIDS Coordinator at Lom a Linda University Children's Medical Center, a nd Kristin Goffm an, Program Coordinator with Injury Prevention Services for the Riverside Count y Public Health Departm ent, presented at the Partners in Prevention 2004 Conference. Thei r presentation was entitled \"Riverside County Subm ersion Incident Reporting System \" and showcas ed a new data collection project, including a training video and checklist for first responders. 18 E. First 5 of San Bernardino The First 5 of San Bernardino Program , created in Decem ber, 1998, by the Children and Families Com mission for San Bernardino County, was established to com bat two basic issues faced within San Bernardino County: putting in place efforts to help decrease ill effects on children, from the prenatal stage to the age of five, who were not achieving the proper m aturation of brain developm ent; and intervening in the liv es of young children to significantly im pact their physical, social, and m ental growth, in keeping w ith Lom a Linda University's m ission of healthy human developm ent. First 5 of San Bernardino's contracted service agencies boast a num ber of success stories that illustrate the im pact of their work on the com munity, including the Saf ety Angels f ree car seat saf ety distribution program , which instructs f amilies on how to correctly use and install child restraint devices in their autom obiles. Another successful program is the Chaffey Joint Union High School District Valley View Infa nt Center, which offers parenting education and m edical services to teen m others and fathers, and fosters well-being and awareness of issues affecting young parents. Susanne Montgom ery, PhD, MPH, Professor of Health Prom otion and Education, and Preventive Medicine Director at Lom a Linda Un iversity Center for Health Research, led a system atic needs assessm ent to better understand if the funding given by First 5 was m eeting the needs of children and their fam ilies.The work was conducted in association with the Departm ent of Health Prom otion and Education, Evaluation and Research Unit at the SPH. Leandra Peters of the Evaluation and Research Unit served as a consultant on the project and developed the parent survey, which was distributed to key inform ants. Graduate student Julie Pham was an Assistant Qualitative Research Director f or the First 5 Qualitative Needs Assessm ent. Preventive Care doctoral student Heather Diaz, MPH was a project director and researcher on this consultant team . Esther Suarez and Janisse Maxwell, MPH students, also worked as research assistants. The team presented their findings at the Am erican Public Health Association (APHA) conference this year and in 2003. They were pa rt of a strategic process in January, 2003, to identif y outcom e indicators that would m easure a nd appraise the needs of families and children ages 0-5. Six advisory team s identified key inform ants to assess perceived needs of the target population, with 18 focus groups, 72 key inform ant in terviews, and m ore than 500 surveys. Final results will help to assist m ore inform ed policy recom mendations to guide the Proposition 10 19 Com mission's allotm ent of future funds. In 2004, the team presented at the APHA and Children Network conferences on the need for em powering, focused service delivery for fa milies in San Bernardino County, based on their county-wide assessm ent in February, 2003, which wa s aim ed to identify need s in four key areas: child health; child developm ent; fam ily functioni ng; and school readiness. They discovered that parents need m ore assistance in being prepared a nd inform ed, as well as m ore health care services that are culturally com petent and supportive. In creased awareness around the issues, as well as empowerm ent techniques associated with deliver ing the services, was also needed, since access and understanding of the services by fam ilies were lim ited. Like m any of the collaborative projects already m entioned, First 5 has been a pr ime site for the field practica of SPH students like Vicki W alker, who, through the DPH and under Elaine Flem ing, MPH, exam ined the barriers to the im plem entation of a 5-a-day workshop in public schools. Her data collection and analyses were com piled from March to July, 2002, and Decem ber, 2002. F. People and Communities Changing Tomorrow (imPACCT) The People and Com munities Changing Tom orrow (im PACCT) project involved Susanne Montgom ery, PhD, MPH, Ron Graybill, MD, student I vy Lewis, Preventive Care doctoral student Heather Diaz, MPH, Janet Flores, MPH, and Master's student in International Health Sharon Rushing, MPH from the SPH Departm ent of H ealth Prom otion and Education. The project applied four program s for teens and parents within San Bernardino, with the collaboration of area non-profit organizations: Latina Youth Diabetes Project; Peer Factor; Building Bridges; Alliance to Opportunity 2002; and the Eco-Elite Nei ghborhood Youth Em powerm ent. In 2003, the team presented som e of their findings at the national APHA conference. All four program s found perm anent housing in local youth serving agencies, and som e continued to receive funding. Significant effects were seen around awareness, future protective behavior intentions, and self -reported risk f actor s. The use of a com munity coalition m odel that involved local organizations directly im pacted the youth and their fam ilies. In the process, evaluation tools, curriculum guides, m aterials, a nd staf fing and f inancial sustainability guidelines were produced. of the af orem entioned pr ojects af filiated with im PACCT are described below: 20 i. Latina Youth Diabetes Project (Phase One) The Latina Youth Diabetes Project, in particul ar, exem plifies the collaborative nature of imPACCT's project m anagem ent. As a part of this work, m embers of the im PACCT team , including Diaz, Montgom ery, Herring, student Eli zabeth Castillo, and form er student Martine Polycarpe, now director of Students for Interna tional Service Missions (SIMS), presented steps toward securing a diabetes-free future by ex amining a prim ary prevention teen pregnancy empowerm ent m odel for high-risk Latinas. In looki ng at the proliferation of Type 2 diabetes among Latina youth, and its contribution to increased morbidity and m ortality, it is clear that prevention m odels are key in San Bernardino Count y, where Latina teen pregnancy rates are also soaring. In the Sum mer of 2002, a pilot interv ention was conducted in San Bernardino County. Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the project indirectly addressed issues of teen pregnancy as an ave nue for creating awareness around Type 2 diabetes. Historically, reaching Latina yout h through program s like these has proved difficult due to their reluctance to participate in activities that label th em as \"high risk\" f or teen pregnancy and chronic health diseases. During the program , young wom en enthusiastically received culturally appropriate training on healthy eating, proper weight control, a nd the overall benefits of healthy lifestyles and behavior. They also participated in a thr ee-day em powerm ent workshop, which em phasized the importance of pride in one's cu ltural identity; prom oted a healthy body im age; and helped them explore their role as wom en in Latino culture. This portion of their training concluded with individual presentations by the young wom en, ranging from poetry recitation to a fashion show, where they proudly displayed ethnic garm ents m ade from scratch. As a result of the project's success and its im plem entation of a f amily-oriented empowerm ent model over a high-risk m odel, the Latina Youth Diabetes Project was re-funded in January, 2004. Program participants were trained to be em powerm ent leaders and recruited two to three peers to com plete the sam e 20-hour tr aining they initially received. The training was curriculum -based and enabled youth to com prehend the unexpected consequences of risk behaviors; they then m ade presentations in th e respective com munities. This sort of com munity interfacing, while focusing on vital prevention tac tics, also triggered a m arked interest am ong community m embers and led to the developm ent of invaluable leadership skills outside the typical constituents. 21 i (a). Latina Youth Diabetes Project (Phase Two) This second phase of the Latina Youth Diabet es Project spread across all strata and closely engaged both academ ics and students. Unde r the close supervision of Project Director, Heather Diaz, MPH, Master's level students from the SPH joined the project staff. Yeira Rodriguez, Ferm in Fierro, Ana Hernandez, Marlon Minera, Patricia Escobar, and Jarm elle Mathews are SPH students who becam e involve d in the Fall of 2003 through their required enrollm ent in HPRO 589: Qualitative Research Methods, HPRO 590: Research Analysis, and HPRO 537 A&B: Com munity Progr ams Lab. These courses, taught by Susanne Montgom ery and Patti Herring, enrich students' traini ng in the areas of research, data analysis, and im plem entation of health prom otion program s by allowing students a hands-on opportunity to actualize their ideas. Previously-taught student s have designed and evaluated a five-session didactic that followed the three-day em powerm ent workshop, which was delivered to a new group of high-risk Latina youth. The project was housed at the Boys and Girls Club, under the direction of Clifford Hackney, and supported by im PACCT project funds from the DPH. Students participated individually and collectiv ely in their selected program . For instance, Yeira Rodriguez, a student pursuing a dual Maste r's degree in Public Health and Maternal and Child Health, served as secretary and editor for her group and conducted qualitative interviews with health professionals, parents, and m inors in the needs assessm ent phase of the project. Once the needs were determ ined, she then conti nued to work with her team to develop a curriculum for the project. The goal of these students' project was to pr esent young Latinas with a fam ilial history of Type 2 diabetes with preventive educational m aterials in a creative and interactive m anner. In turn, the teens were to present the inform ation they learned to a group of their peers and also serve as promotoras in their f amilies and com munities. The intervention not only provided the youth with vital educational m aterial but al so with encouragem ent, em powerm ent, and mentorship skills. As previously m entioned, a lengthy needs assessm ent was created along with other docum ents, such as a com prehensive literature revi ew, detailed plan, evaluation, and final report. The assessm ent included research that took ethnogr aphic observations into account. Eighteen key inform ant interviews were also conducted with youth, parents, and professionals; and a focus group with teens supplem ented these findings. Through various research m ethodologies, it was concluded that fear of diabetes and concer ns around both body im age and weight m anagem ent 22 motivated the youth to seek m ore inform ation. The im plem entation portion of the project allo wed the group to create a personalized five- session curriculum that covered topics in diabet es, nutrition, reproductive health, fitness, and skill building. The first session, \"Diabetes-Free is the W ay to Be,\" was taught by Ana Hernandez; the second session, \"Nutrition 101,\" by Patricia Esc obar; the third session, \"Let's Talk About Reproductive Health,\" by Rodriguez; the fourth session, \"Fitness Facts,\" by Ferm in Fierro; and the final session, \"W hat Does it Take to be a H ealthy Me? \" was led by Marlon Minera. The five sessions were preceded by the three em powerm ent and cultural awareness lessons given by Diaz. Pre- and post-test surveys of the five education sessions revealed that teens dem onstrated a 7-84% increase in knowledge of the presented topics. The teens responded favorably to the sessions, and collectively, viewed the workshop on diabetes as the \"m ost im portant.\" The combination of the em powerm ent and cultural awareness lessons and the five student-run sessions resulted in enhanced knowledge and cognition, as well as positive quality of life (QOL) changes as m easured by QOL indicators. Abstracts for the two distinct program com ponents have been accepted for presentation at the 2004 APHA conference in W ashington, DC. ii. Peer Factor Peer Factor was a pilot project targeted toward at-risk teenagers in San Bernardino County. The program trained teens to dissem inate h ealth data to other teens and to develop vital leadership and critical thinking skills around at-risk behaviors such as the consum ption of drugs and alcohol, and unsafe sex. From July to Sept ember, 2002, project coordinators trained ten County teens to be peer health educators, who then reached another ten teens in the surrounding community. Sharon Rushing, MPH, was Peer Facto r's Project Director. Other project m embers included Montgom ery, Katrina Ball, MPH, and stude nt Ivy Lewis, all from the SPH Departm ent of Health Prom otion and Education, Evaluation and Research Unit. The teenagers underwent 20 hours of training ove r a three-week period and studied topics such as alcohol, designer drugs, street drugs, STD' s, and parental and peer pressure. The teens were also instructed on how to develop engaging program activities and outreach m aterials. They were also in charge of planning a \"teen hea lth challenge booth\" activity at Pharaoh's Lost Kingdom , a popular entertainm ent locale for youth. Th e activity was designed to teach health and behavior issues to participants. The challenge booth consisted of four different activities: STD 23 Basketball; Hip-Hop Challenge; Rap Challenge; a nd Intoxicated Barbie. STD Basketball entailed asking participants true or false questions a bout STD's, having them guess the correct answer, and then letting them shoot a ball through a bask et to accum ulate points. Hip-Hop Challenge encouraged participation in the other three activ ities available to teens. Rap challenge allowed participants to use facts about STD's, drugs, and alcohol to create a positive m essage that they would deliver to teens in the form of a rap song. Intoxicated Barbie had participants wear blindfolds and try to get balloons into bins of water, dem onstrating that alcohol consum ption, analogous to being blindfolded, im pairs m otor skills. Qualitative results dem onstrated that peer health educators cam e away f rom the experience with a positive outlook and a conviction that they had the power to change their peers' perceptions of at-risk behavior. The peer hea lth educators also displayed an increase in confidence and knowledge of STD's, alcohol, and drugs. Results dem onstrated an increase in knowledge by 55.6% to 77.8%, which proved statisti cally significant in non-param etric W ilcoxon Signed Ranks Tests. Out of those who participated in the hea lth challenge booth activity, 110 teens asserted that they would recom mend the activity to f riends and participate in sim ilar f uture activities. The peer health educators also received m ultiple re quests from com munity organizations, parents, churches, schools, and other institutions to perf orm at various functions and receive additional inform ation, such as im plem enting sim ilar p eer health educator program s in their own communities. ii (a). Peer Factor II Phase II of the Peer Factor Project was deve loped in the Sum mer of 2003, as an extension of the work that was com pleted the previous y ear. Peer Factor II provided additional training for five of the original peer health leaders. In this com ponent, teens evaluated the im pact of the previous training in their lives, exam ined re tained knowledge, reinforced this knowledge, and recruited and trained an additional three teenag ers each. In the focus group that was conducted with the teenagers, it was revealed that the trai ning they received the previous year enabled them to becom e more aware of their surroundings, c hoose friends m ore wisely, im prove their self- esteem , and learn things they wouldn't otherwise learn in their schools. 24 The teenagers' additional training was provi ded by People's Choice, Incorporated. The 16 teenagers recruited by the peer health leaders were all at-risk youth, prim arily from the African American and Latino com munities. The peer health leaders utilized a Train the Trainer Model in preparing and presenting topics for their trainees. Each of the five trainers was given a topic to share with their trainees. During the course of the 20-hour training, the peer health leaders fostered an interactive training environm ent for their peers by using a com bination of lectures, skits, role-play activities, and video. Shared testim onials f rom the trainees dem onstrated that the knowledge they gained in this environm ent affect ed them profoundly; and in som e cases, led to the dim inishm ent of at-risk activities in these teens. At the end of the training, each trainer was a ssigned a group of four teens to plan activities at Pharaoh's Lost Kingdom at end, each trainer assigned group of four teens to plan activities for another \"teen health challenge booth\" at Pharaoh's Lost Kingdom . The activities m irrored the ones from the prior year, but two of the activ ities underwent nam e e Tipsy Toss. Sixty-one teens participated in the activities and ranged f rom 11-18 years old. Quantitative results f rom surveys dem onstrated that 95% of the participants would recom mend th e program to a friend, 97% would participate in similar f uture activities, and 87% would use the information they learned f or future decision- making. In assessing the Train the Trainer Model used by the peer health leaders, it was indicated that 94% of the trainers and trainees felt they knew the health issues enough to teach their peers; and over 90% of the trainers expressed an increas e in confidence after providing training to their peers. iii. Eco-Elite Neighborhood Youth Empowerment The Eco-Elite Youth Em powerm ent program was launched in July, 2002, and is directed by Ron Graybill, MD, Com munity Outreach Coordi nator for the Lom a Linda Medical Center. The program is an after-school collaborative that is part of the Norton Neighborhoods Initiative, also directed by Graybill. The Norton Nei ghborhoods Initiative is focused on im proving the health and quality of life in the San Bernar dino and Highland neighborhoods in the County. A part of the Association f or Com munity Health Im provem ent, the Initiative desists f rom a needs and def icits assessm ent of the com munity it serv es, instead focusing on Asset -Based Com munity Developm ent (ABCD). In building on existing neighborhood networks and skills, the Initiative's program s are culturally and linguistically appropriate and are often directly related to cultural 25 competence and diversity. After-school program s such as the Eco-Elite Youth Em powerm ent program offer tutoring and m entoring, local transportation, food security, and safety. Eco-Elite consists of m iddle and high school students from the Valley View neighborhood, which com prises approxim ately 350 households. The program empowers teens to better understand and im pact their natural, social, econom ic, and political environm ents in order to in crease their sense of place, pride, and hope for the future. Som e of the ways in which this is done include becom ing fam iliar with the flora and fauna along the Santa Ana River; exploring the history of their neighborhood and the people who live there; learning about child safety and child abuse, and discovering ways to work with the children in their neighborhood; exam ining potential careers in environm ental science, city politics, and health and hum an services; learni ng about safety issues related to firearm s, autom obiles, and CPR; and delving into other s ubjects that m erge from their discovery of their community's ecology. The students in the project are trained to em power their younger peers in getting m ore involved in accessing city services and im pacting their com munities. They also learn how to assist their com munities in com plying with city codes around anim al control, safety, and environm ental protection; cleaning up the Santa Ana River bottom ; creating a Native Calif ornia Plant garden and discovering the original native uses of these plants; and creating an asset m ap of their neighborhood. All work is accessible in both Spanish and English. 26 G. Families Organiz ed for Community Unification and Success (FOCUS) The Fam ilies Organized f or Com munity Un ification and Success (FOCUS) project reflects an eight-year collaborative effort betw een the DPH, Lom a Linda University, the San Bernardino City Parks and Recreation Departm ent, the City of San Bernardino Mentoring Program , the San Bernardino Arts Council, and th e San Bernardino City Un ified School District. In 1996, the Perinatal and Adolescent Life Sec tion (PALS) program office at the DPH was approved for funding from the Ca lifornia Office of Com munity Challenge Grants (CCG) to implem ent the FOCUS Project. The project has b een coordinated by Karen Zukrow, MSW , and is based out of the PALS office at the DPH. The m ission of the FOCUS project is to co llaboratively reduce teen pregnancy through prevention education and youth developm ent activities. FOCUS provides youth program s to prom ote positive adolescent growth and devel opment, f amily program s to prom ote positive interaction, and com munity program s to provide youth with support and inform ation. The goal is to reduce teen and unplanned pregnancy and to in crease parent involvem ent with their children. FOCUS serves youth 10-17 years ol d and their fam ilies living in the cities of Colton, Highland, Redlands, San Bernardino, and the high desert communities of Victorville and Apple Valley. The role of the SPH Evaluation and Resear ch Unit, led by Susanne Montgom ery, PhD, MPH, was to develop the evaluation piece for the grant proposal; design tools to assess the program 's outcom es; collect and analyze the da ta; and produce written sum maries of the results. Janet Flores, MPH and DrPH candidate, is a m ember of the Evaluation and Research Unit who came on board in the Fall of 1999. Up until 2002, Flores and m embers of the Evaluation and Research Unit produced quarterly reports to CCG on behalf of the FOCUS Project. For the past year, Disep Obuge, MPH, of the Program Analysis and Statistics Section in the DPH, has been the statistical analyst for the FOCUS project. However, the Evaluation and Research Unit, including Montgom ery and Flores, has rem ained ac tive in the evaluation ef forts of the FOCUS Project. The DPH Statistical Analysis Departm ent m anages the FOCUS data, m aintains the program 's database in-house, and conducts outcom es analyses, while Flores interprets the statistical results and sum marizes the outcom es with written narrative reports. The FOCUS Project is delivered through seven subcom ponents: FOCUSed Youth; Streetwise to Sex W ise; FOCUSed Youth Ar ts Residency Program ; San Bernardino City 27 Mentoring Program ; After School Youth Developm ent Program ; Job Skills Developm ent; and the Parent Involvem ent Project. i. FOCUSed Youth The FOCUSed Youth is a ten-hour youth de velopm ent curriculum developed by DPH staff targeting 11-14 year old students attending Cu rtis Middle School in the San Bernardino City Unified School District. The curriculum addresses issues pertinent to adolescence, such as peer pressure, conflict resolution and problem solving, values clarification, self-concept, diversity awareness, interpersonal com munication, and outlook to the future. Program evaluation results for 2003-04 s howed that although the FOCUSed Youth participants began with high scores in knowledge of health-related issues and awareness of the fundam ental requirem ents in m aking healthy and positive life choices, they still experienced gains in these areas. Youth also dem onstrated signi ficant im provem ents in areas of interpersonal communication of feelings, com munication with adults, and locus of control over self- improvem ent. ii. Streetwise to Sex Wise Streetwise to Sex W ise provides sex educa tion to high-risk teens attending alternative schools. The instruction is carried out by Califor nia State University, San Bernardino social work PALS interns who are supervised by Zukrow. Sexual attitudes im proved f ollowing the Streetwi se intervention f or 23 of the 36 m atched participants in the last year. In addition, m ore students considered birth control the m utual responsibility of sexual partners than did before the intervention. Overall, the Street Wise curriculum has proven to have a positive effect on sexual attitudes, beliefs and knowledge. iii. FOCUSed Youth Arts Residency Program FOCUSed Youth Arts Residency Program is an innovative program , directed by the Arts Council that connects youth with the arts to im prove their self-confidence and prom ote positive attitudes about the future. Muralists, m usicians, writers, photographers, and other artists from the community are invited to serve as artists in residency for a six-week period, during which they lead a group of FOCUS students in an intensive art project. Each residency offers secondary 28 school-aged youth of all ethnicities, opportunities to express them selves through art and to build self-esteem . Past students have painted m urals and showcased their writing and dram atic skills. The FOCUSed Youth Arts Residency Progr am was associated with a num ber of statistically significant changes in the youth pa rticipants of the program . A com parison of surveys conducted before and after the interventi on indicated significant gains in self-concept, self-confidence, positive outlook, and learning about oneself. iv. The Mentoring Program The Parks and Recreation Departm ent for the County directs the City of San Bernardino Mentoring Program , in collaboration with FOCUS. High-risk teens ages of 10 and 17 with truancy problem s are brought to the attention of social workers, often siblings of PALS participants, through the PALS project and th en referred to the m entoring program . The Mentoring Program provides the m entor training, m atches the target youth with trained m entors, and tracks, m onitors, and supports the m entoring relationships. Over 50 youth have been mentored since the m entoring program was launche d. W ithin the last three years, the m entoring program extended its services to educate the pare nts of m entees on issues of parenting, wellness, safety, and prevention. The overall picture of the m entor/m entee rela tionship is positive, with m entees rating the qualities of youth centeredness, em otional attachm ent, and satisfaction with these relationships very highly. Mentees perceived their m entors as m ore engaging over tim e. Positive changes included higher m entee ratings of self-confidence, and of m entors soliciting m entees' thoughts, inputs, and opinions over tim e. More parents were reported attending parenting classes at posttest, which attests to the recruitm ent ef forts of the program staff. Mentees' increased ratings of how alike they and their m entors were indi cated a deepened understanding of them selves and of their m entors, and pointed to the program matic successes in m atching m entees to m entors. v. FOCUSed Y outh II - After School Youth Development Program FOCUSed Youth II program was an after-s chool youth developm ent program held throughout the year at Curtis Middle School. The program includes after-school m ini-courses focusing on friendships, conflict resolution, anger m anagem ent, and com munication skills, volunteer activities, and self-im provem ent support groups for m iddle school students that prom ote healthy life choices, and a sense of m eaningful com munity involvem ent. In the 2003-04 period, 29 57 students com pleted 3 hours or m ore of after-sc hool activities, despite fluctuating and seasonal attendance. Over half of participants achieve d a 20% knowledge increase, dem onstrating a better grasp of conflict resolution, healthful behaviors, and social relationships. vi. Job Skills Development The FOCUS Job Skills Developm ent intervention is a 3-hour career exploration experience that pairs FOCUS youth from com munity day schools with local business professionals. The purpose of the job skills de velopm ent intervention is to expose youth to a variety of career options, m ake youth aware of the im portance of education, training, and professionalism to their future em ploym ent, and help them to realistically plan to enter the world of work. Alternative school students attendi ng Colton Com munity Day School and Apple Valley Com munity Day School were targeted for this intervention. According the program 's evaluation results for 2003-04, 66% of the m atched group reported that career exploration was a positive l earning experience f or them , reflecting enhanced understanding at posttest of possible future job op tions, skill requirem ents, and qualifications for these jobs. Nearly 95% of participants listed appropriate educational objectives for them selves that would prepare them for future em ploym ent. Further, participants signif icantly increased their understanding and awareness of possible future car eers, of what people do in the jobs they shadowed, and of what it takes to find a gainful em ploym ent. vii. Parent Involvement Project The Parent Involvem ent Project has evolved over the past three years as a vehicle to involve m ore parents in activities sponsored by FOCUS. The City of San Bernardino Mentoring Program , one of several FOCUS project com ponent s, began to offer courses to im prove their parenting skills, including teen pregnancy risk reduction; poison control; seat belt saf ety; and osteoporosis. Qualitative data reveals that both pa rents and their fam ilies have expressed m ore consciousness about their health and safety, and th at gathering together for the courses enabled them to garner support from other parents. In 2002, Flores, Susanne Montgom ery, PhD, MPH, and Am y Binggeli, MPH, RD, CHES, identified barriers to parent involvem ent in a fam ily support program . During a year-long qualitative evaluation; data from six key inform ant interviews; data from two focus groups with both youth and parents; and data from Project st aff, it was revealed that both parents and youth 30 seek im proved connection and com munication with each other, but that pragm atic barriers in parent involvem ent persist. These barriers exist in fam ily support program s, including those created by FOCUS staff. The Parent Involvem ent team recom mended skills training and support for service providers who are responsible for parent recruitm ent in inner-city neighborhoods. The team also exam ined parental involvem ent and its effect on teen sexual behaviors. It was discovered that positive parental involvem ent is instrum ental in delaying teen participation in sexual behaviors. The qualitative study included 12 key inform ant and 2 focus group interviews for teens 14-20 years old, and 13 key inform ant and 2 focus group interviews for parents 30-48 years old. The study revealed the im portance of id entifying positive factors of parent involvem ent in their teens' lives, which is invaluable in public health program planning efforts. Two focus groups, one in English and one in Spanish, were conducted with parents of mentees through the Mentoring Program to exam ine parent learning and support outcom es of participants of the parenting education portion of the m entoring program . Salient them es that emerged in the English-language discussion incl uded (1) issues of single m others and single grandm others raising children and grandchildre n, (2) difficulties finding effective m ethods of discipline for pre-teen and adolescent childre n, (3) problem s with m ale children acting out violently at hom e and at school, (4) dom estic viol ence, and (5) m others' lack of self-esteem possibly relating to dom estic abuse and/or divor ce, and (6) dif ficulties f inding the tim e to enjoy relaxing activities as a single m others. The sec ond focus group of Spanish-speaking participants revealed that parents had learned a great deal about nutrition the prevention of osteoporosis and cited several exam ples of how they were m aking healthier choices at hom e, such as switching from whole m ilk to lower fat m ilk. After som e concern that parent participati on and interest was lacking across the existing modalities, project leadership set out to investig ate possible causes. The Evaluation and Research Unit coordinated an extensive needs assessm ent th at revealed unexpected findings. More than learning how to reduce their teens' risk for pr egnancy, parents were eager to learn how to improve their teens' education and expressed frus tration with being unable to navigate the U.S. educational system - a challenge for m any im migrant Spanish-speaking fam ilies. In response to this im portant feedback, m embers of the FOCU S Project and the Evaluation and Research Unit enlisted the help of the Parent Institute, w ho trained 120 Spanish-speaking parents on how to understand the educational system with a nine-week curriculum . This curriculum defined the role that parents m ust play in their children's education to ensure academ ic success in the U.S., 31 covering key topics such as interpreting a re port card; m aximizing m eetings with teachers; helping their teen establish a four-year plan fo r college; and locating finances for college. The Parent Institute dem onstrated a m arked im provem ent in parents' knowledge of the educational system and com fort in traversing it to benef it thei r teens. These well-received steps to engaging parents transcended the m ajor FOCUS m odalities. H. Faith-Based Promotora Model for the Reduction of Heart Disease in Latinos In 2002, Patti Herring, PhD, RN, Susanne Mont gomery, PhD, MPH and m any of the other SPH students who participated in the im PACCT Project's m odule on diabetes in the Latino community (including Heather Diaz, MPH, a nd Christy Inskip, BA) f urther utilized the Promotora Model in churches to reach Latinos at high risk for heart disease. These efforts were brought forth as a result of the collaboration between Diaz and Lourdes Vizcaino of the Am erican Heart Association, who were supported by Drs. He rring and Montgom ery. This was as a result of past collaborative efforts. In com parison to W hites and Asian Am ericans, Latinos tend toward higher rates of heart disease. This project, which was entirely voluntee r-based, set out to exam ine issues related to heart disease prevention am ong the parishioners of St. Catherine's, a predom inantly Latino church com munity in San Bernardino County. The ta rgeted geographical area ranked sixth in the County for heart-disease-related deaths. The Am erican Heart Association and Pfizer conducted health screenings for cholesterol and hypertension at a health fair that was held at the church. Out of 200 participants, 50% dem onstrated high chol esterol and hypertension. This discovery led to collaboration with the SPH, who assessed the need s of the com munity and ways to reduce high disease risk factors.4 SPH staff and students im plem ented a traini ng and outreach program at St. Catherine's Church. Sonia Vega, MPH, RD, of the Public H ealth Nutrition Program at the DPH, led a cooking demonstration and dissem inated 5-a-Day educationa l materials to participants. In addition, Vega aided in translating these m aterials into Spanish. Topics covered in the training's workshops include nutrition, hypertension, exercise and 4 The assessm ent utilized elem ents of So cial Cognitive Theory and consisted of windshield surveys, 15 key inform ant interviews, a focus group, and literature reviews. The n eeds assessm ent phase of this project was conducted as a 32 33 stress, smoking cessation, diabetes, understanding th e signs of heart attacks and strokes, and cholesterol reduction. Five to six participants d ecreased their weight after participating in the program, while others saw reductions in their cholesterol and glucose levels. Twelve participants became promotoras in their communities and volunteered for the program, which ended in March, 2004, and was renewed by the American Health Association in June, 2004. One community member, Cecilia Ruiz, was a promotora in the first round of the program, and has since been hired by the American Health Association on a part-time basis to help run the program during its current period. Results from the assessment and training reveal a demonstrable increase in knowledge. It was discovered that the target population revealed a preference for holistic health preferences; and cultural barriers to exercising and eating were also exhibited. The desire for an advisory board and a program based upon the Promotora Model, which provides positive reinforcement through social networks and personal relationships, stemmed from the initial analysis of the community. The community's desire for a worki ng knowledge of heart-healthy lifestyles in the context of their lives was presented as a model for future intervention programs targeting similar populations. I. Diabetes Self-Management for Independent Living Senior Education (S.M.I.L.E.) The Diabetes Self-Management for Independe nt Living Senior Education (S.M.I.L.E) project arose from the need for better self-man agement of aging African American and Latino diabetics in the city of San Bernardino. The SPH Office of Public Health Practice was granted funding for this project in 2001 by the Association of Schools of Public H ealth through the Health Resources and Services Administration. Key goals for the project were to provide culturally appropriate health promotion and disease preven tion services to underserved African American and Latino seniors with Type 2 diabetes in the city, and to incorporate a model that combined community and university collaboration with se rvice learning opportunities for future public health professionals. Heather Diaz, MPH, was the project director, and worked under the guidance of Patti Herring, PhD, RN, and Susanne Montgomery, PhD, MPH. The impetus for the project was establishing trust in the African American community. Additionally, many immigrant populations, especially elderly Latinos, display a lack of utilization segment of the Community Programs Lab course in the SPH Department of Health Promotion and Education. of com munity-based health resources. The project attem pted to dissolve these historical barriers and foster com munity collaboration and trust to improve the quality of life am ong seniors in the area. Graduate students in the year-long Com munity Program s Lab course at the SPH gathered needs assessm ent data. The course provides cr ucial m ethods for planning health education curricula with target populations and evalua ting subsequent program impacts. The needs assessm ent revealed that participants desire inf ormation for self-m anagem ent of diabetes, and also want m ore inform ation about com munity resour ces and required m edication assistance. It was qualitatively determ ined that three independent curricula and health education trainings were necessary to reach the African Am erican and Latino populations in culturally com petent ways. In order to connect the com munities with diab etes m anagem ent resources in their area and to facilitate proper diabetes care, three curriculum s were instituted to target specific populations: The Plaza; The Black/African Am erican Health Com mittee; and Monterey Elem entary Parenting Group. The Plaza is a senior living facility in San Be rnardino, with seniors of various nationalities who are afflicted with Type 2 diabetes. The senior s were presented with a series of courses that would help them to identify com munity resources and receive valuable health guidance. The Black/Af rican Am erican Health Co mmittee issued f rom a health com mittee comprising m embers of the local Inland Em pire Concerned African Am erican Church Consortium (IECAAC). In a Train the Trainer M odel, the curriculum instilled valuable health mentorship skills in com munity m embers. Curri culum materials included com prehensive health education and com puter disks for personal usage and study. Lastly, the Monterey Elem entary Parenting Group included m others of elem entary school children who attend parenting classes at this local school. The program was sponsored by the DPH and included m aterials in both English and Spanish translation. The group of m others was chosen due to their previously established fam ily orientation; the wom en involved stated that, in addition to caring for their young children, they al so cared for husbands and aging parents who were af flicted with diabetes. W ith qualitative eval uation f indings f rom interviews and surveys, it was discovered that the three program s were helpfu l in allowing participants a down-to-earth and empowering understanding of diabetes m anagem ent.5 34 5 Student s from the Community Program s Lab course m easured program impact by using a m ixed m ethods approach. An increase i n knowl edge above t he basel ine was i ndicated in their resul ts, and i t was dem onstrated that 71.4% of A key im pact of the project was the im plem entation of a service learning and com munity collaboration m odel, which engaged graduate st udents and prom oted a com munity and university partnership. The collaborative also enlisted the expertise of a DPH Advisory Board, including Sonia Vega, MPH, RD, of the DPH Nutrition De partm ent; Eddy Jara, MPH, RD, ent; and June Hibbard, RN, BS , MPH, the Public Health Manager in the County's Departm ent of Adult and Aging Se rvices. The Advisory Board aided in the identification of com munity resources and offere d valuable guidance in developing curricula and implem enting program s. The partnership m odel created by the Adviso ry Board provided crucial opportunities for collaborations on future chronic disease preventi on program s. This resulted in a physical office managed and housed in the Office of Public Health Practice at the SPH. Funds from the grant also facilitated the developm ent of a website f eaturing collaborative past, present and f uture projects, as well as an on-site location for com munity m embers to access university resources. The largest im pact of the project was the partnerships created am ong the Am erican Heart Association, Am erican Diabetes Association, Inland Em pire Concerned African Am erican Church (IECAAC), Com munity Hospital of Sa n Bernardino, and The Plaza. These alliances served to solidif y the partnership between the SPH and DPH, particularly with the Nutrition departm ent, which sustained a close relations hip with the DPH. The Am erican Diabetes Association partnered with the Latina Youth Diab etes Project for an extensive year-long health education program .6 A program entitled \"W orking f or and W ith Seniors\" was f ormed for The Plaza. All of the aforem entioned projects were accepted for presentation and publication at the APHA conferences in 2003 and 2004. J. Preventive Care for San Bernardino's Aging Population Among the academ ic program s offered by the Health Prom otion and Education Departm ent at the SPH is the distinctive Preventive Care doctoral program , whose novel curriculum and approach to training have drawn national attention in public health academ ia. The program is designed to prepare stude nts in confronting a range of health and lifestyle issues with program object ives were m et. 35 6 See Section F: im PACCT. a special em phasis on chronic disease prevention. Other com ponents include nutritional assessm ent, exercise testing, and substance abuse counseling. As the program 's coordinator, Edward Fujim oto, DrPH, plays a crucial role in he lping to prepare these specialists in wellness and lifestyle intervention. He specializes in h ealth education, preventive care, nutrition, health prom otion, and lifestyle m edicine. Fujim oto has al so been active in furthering research on dioxin, a horm one-disrupting chem ical that increases th e risk of cancer and other chronic health problem s. His research has been aired on vari ous news channels, including FOX and Toronto Television. In early 2004, the Departm ent of Aging and Adult Services of the DPH awarded $64,000 to a m ulti-school collaborative project between th e School of Medicine, the School of Pharm acy, and the SPH. Fujim oto and his colleague s, Lee Berk, DrPH, MPH, CHES, FACSM, and Brenda Rea, DrPH, MPT, ACSM, form ed part of the SPH-b ased research team to screen approxim ately 100 older residents in the previously neglected communities of Trona, Newberry, and Needles. Students and staff from the three LLU schools screened the older adults at m ultiple senior centers using the Health Age Plus com puterized health screening system . Berk is Associate Director for the Cent er of Neuroim munology, as well as Assistant Professor in the Health Prom otion and Educati on departm ent of the SPH. Berk's research in psychoneuroim munology, or m ind/body m edicine, has received international attention. His research on the im pact of m irthful laughter and exercise on neuroendocrine and immune functions has been featur ed on countless TV shows, including Good Morning America , 60 Minutes , and m ost recently, Oprah. Rea is Coordinator of the B SPH W ellness Managem ent Program and Assistant Professor in the Health Prom otion and Education depart ment. Her research interests include health prom otion in physical therapy and dietary analysis and prescription. Rea is a registered dietitian and a Certif ied Health and Fitness Instructor w ith m ore than eight years of personal training experience. Fujim oto, Berk, and Rea offered their expertis e in lifestyle assessm ent, chronic disease prevention, and health prom otion to effectively im plem ent the pilot project. In addition, they coached four Preventive Care doctoral students - Ken Stewart, Anuj Bhatia, Eileen Guerrero, and Heather Diaz - on the proper adm inistration of the Health Age Plus program . Billy Manasseh, a first-year Preventive Care doctoral student, provided further technical training on the special features of the Health Age Plus system to ensu re proper inputting and processing of data. This 36 intricate program incorporates two key com ponent s: lifestyle assessm ent and health screening. The Lifestyle Assessm ent portion consists of que stions on physical activity, sm oking, diet, overall happiness, sleep habits, and social support. The Health Screening section evaluates blood pressure, waist girth, percentage of body fat, strength, hand grip, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood glucose level, aerobic capacity, resting pulse, and heel bone density. Data is entered m anually for each participant into the system , which then com putes individuals' BMI (body m ass index) and produces a \"Lifestyle, Hea lth, and Longevity Appraisal\" that offers suggestions for m odifying key lifestyle factors known to influence health and longevity. The research team and student volunteers aided the seniors in interpreting their com puter- generated output, responded to their questions a nd concerns, and connected them to needed services through referrals. Although program evalua tion results are still in progress, the positive response from seniors and enthusiasm from com munity leaders have urged the research team to pursue further funding for sim ilar endeavors in these and nearby m edically disadvantaged communities. K. Perinatal and Adolescent Life Services (PALS) Perinatal and Adolescent Life Services (PALS) is a com mon site at the DPH that provides students from the SPH with a pivotal opportunity to gain experience during their schooling in the area of m aternal and child health. The PALS program was developed after a com prehensive community needs assessm ent and focus groups were conducted in underserved com munities of San Bernardino. The program was directed for almost 20 years by LLU alum na Linda Levisen, MSW , RN, up until her recent retirem ent, and is now under the direction of Vanessa Long, RN, MSN, program manager of m aternal and child health. During her tenure, Levisen served as a member on the SPH Health Prom otion and Education Advisory Board for m aternal and child health program s. PALS offers high-risk adolescents case m anagem ent services to provide them with assistance in getting their basic needs m et (e.g. food, shelter, clothing). The success of the program has attracted m ore funding, and the PA LS team was able to begin providing support services to adolescent fathers and siblings of pregnant teens. PALS case m anagers and social workers are also going to local high schools to facilitate education and prom otion of positive alternatives and options for youth during lunchtim e. Under the supervision of Andy Ndela, MPH, CHES, student Am anda Frye, who is now 37 completing a degree in nursing, com pleted her Public Health field practicum with the PALS program from Septem ber to Decem ber of 2001. Her responsibilities included the developm ent of key presentations for adult training; she also attended a series of workshops and prepared a comprehensive resource list.7 L. Tobacco Use Reduction Now (TURN) The Tobacco Use Reduction Now (TURN) progr am provides com prehensive county-wide tobacco control prevention services and edu cation, m cam paigns, policy suggestion and implem entation, volunteer recruitm ent, teacher tr aining, sponsorship of com munity events, toll- free inform ation, a referral hotline, and investiga tion into the violation of State and County anti- smoking laws. Eileen Guerrero, a doctoral student in Prev entive Care, com pleted her field practicum for TURN, after which she went on to becom e a part-tim e public service em ployee with the DPH. As part of her practicum , she assi sted fellow student Laurie Mazzei and Kay Adkins, MPH, in evaluating sm oke-free doorways policy am ong colle ges and trade and vocational schools from April to August of 2003. Her work involved the advocacy and adoption of tobacco policies; developing county-wide com prehensive tobacco control services; and securing funding and support for the updating and adoption of policies in schools. Over the years, TURN has attracted several SPH student interns including Jam es Jo, who completed his internship in January to March of 1998. Under the supervisi on of Lilia Fontam illas, MPH, Jo assisted with the project's inform ation booth at health fairs and visited businesses to discuss indoor sm oking. In 2002, Fontam illas also supervised another SPH alum nus, Rutsuko Kinjo, who updated TURN's library and helped pr ogram staff increase the num ber of offices in the region. Student Laurie Mazzei, under Kay Adkins, MPH, dissem inated educational m aterial to the public and conducted workshops on sm oking preven tion in the workplace, and helped enforce the California Sm oke-Free W orkplace law.8 M.

BUILDING FUTURE LEADERS: St udent and Alumni Case Studies The DPH em ployees, whose case studies are pr esented below, all have one thing in common - they are current students or alum ni of the SPH. Their stories epitom ize the value of academ ic and public health service partnerships . For these individuals, the early adoption of research and leadership roles with the DPH through field placem ents by the SPH proved to be an important conduit toward future em ploym ent with the DPH. A. Rebecca Nanyonjo Prior to becom ing a Public Health Epidem iologist in 2002 in the AIDS/STD Control Program , and m ore recently, a Supervising Epidem iologist, Rebecca Nanyonjo was a public service em ployee (PSE) with the DPH for 13 m onths. During that tim e she assisted epidem iologists with the investigation and reporting of HIV/AIDS cases, running various epidem iologic reports, helping with several projects, such as the \"Get Tested!\" Project sponsored by the California Departm ent of Health Services and offering her assistance with the 2000 Annual AIDS Report. Her tim e spent as a PSE m et the field practicum requirem ents for her pursuit of a dual Master's degree, in Epidem iology and Intern ational Heath. As an epidem iologist, she has been responsible for working m ore collaboratively with different disciplines within the program ; such as running data requests for the com munity, running internal reports necessary for grants, presentations and pam phlet m aterial and pr oject coordination for various assignm ents. In fulfilling her field practicum require ment, Nanyonjo analyzed a previously administered survey to exam ine why certain subgr oups did not take precautions when engaging in risky sexual practices. Using a cross-secti onal study design, a convenience sam ple of all participants from San Bernardino County STD clinic s was studied to test the survey instrum ent, KABB\u2014Knowledge, Attitude, Beliefs and Beha viors\u2014used in 1998. The KABB survey consisted of questions relating to practices and behaviors deem ed risky in contracting HIV/AIDS or sexually transm itted diseases. Another objectiv e of the survey was to gather inf ormation on beliefs and whether certain factors placed an indi vidual at high risk, low risk, or no risk at all.9 Nanyonjo is currently a candidate for the doctora te in Preventive Care at the SPH, in the 41 9 See Section IV: Field Practica. Departm ent of Health Prom otion and Educa tion. Her projected dissertation will involve a secondary analysis of infant cohort data collected by the California Departm ent of Vital Statistics. Nanyonjo is occasionally invited to present at the SPH weekly sem inars alongside health education staff, and give presentations for Ja yakaran Job's EPDM 544 course, Epidem iology of Infectious Diseases. B. Anuj Bhatia Anuj Bhatia, now a doctoral candidate in the Preventive Care program at the SPH, completed 400 hours in the Departm ent of Epidem iology/Bioterrorism as a student intern, where he worked under the supervision of Dr. Geneva Sagun, a public health epidem iologist, and Dr. Alison Rue, a public health epidem iologist and Program Coordinator for the BioTerrorism /Infectious Diseases program . Si nce his field practicum placem ent, Bhatia has transitioned to a f ull-tim e public service em ployee, where he is involved in data entry, investigating m inor outbreaks, and helping to develop various databases for these outbreaks. Bhatia's investigations have included following a questionnaire protocol and interviewing people afflicted by the disease in question, as well as professionals who are involved in treatm ent and identif ication of the illness af ter an outbreak. Bhatia has worked on the enhanced surve illance project at the Route 66 Convention in San Bernardino County, distributing to and coll ecting questionnaires from various em ergency room s in hospitals across the County, as well as monitoring the hospitals in their respective emergency room s and interviewing patients in the waiting room . In addition, he volunteered on behalf of the DPH for those disp laced by the fires that occurred in the Fall of 2003 in the County. Bhatia and his colleagues traveled to the ol d airport hangars where displaced fam ilies and individuals were being housed, and updated m edical records for the public health nurses on duty. They also helped organize these records into a system where the nurses could easily access them . In addition, Bhatia worked with the Health Age Plus program , under Edward Fujim oto, DrPH, funded by the Departm ent of Aging and Adult Serv ices DPH Grant. Bhatia aided staff and LLU faculty from the School of Medicine, School of Pharm acy, and the SPH in screening senior citizens in neglected San Bernardino County com munities. Bhatia also attended various lectures 42 and workshops, such as the Epi Exchange of S outhern California, and Standardized Em ergency Managem ent System lectures.10 C. Stephen Noz aki A 2003 alum nus of the SPH, Nozaki worked as a Public Health Epidem iologist in the DPH AIDS/STD Control Program s from January, 2001 through July, 2004, leaving the departm ent to pursue dentistry back at Lom a Linda University in the Fall of 2004. For his required field practicum for the MP H in Epidem iology, Nozaki worked on the \"Get Tested!\" Chlam ydia Screening Study. The study was conducted in two parts from April, 2001 through Septem ber, 2001, and then receive d new funding from October, 2001 through March, 2002. The goal of this cross-sectional study was to assess the prevalence of C trachom atis and N gonorrhea infections and identify predicto r variables am ong wards of the court in an attem pt to initiate routine screening of sexually transm itted inf ections.11 One thousand consecutive adm issions to juvenile hall were screened by a health services assistant for C trachomatis (Chlam ydia) and N gonorrhea (gonorrhea). C trachomatis infected 9% (93) of the juveniles screened, and 88% of this num ber were asym ptom atic. N gonorrhea infected 2% (16) of the juveniles. Thirty-thr ee percent of the youth had received m edical care in the past 12 m onths from the juvenile justice system , but purportedly without receiving routine screening for C trachom atis and N gonorrhea, which must be incorporated into care standards for incarcerated young people. While at the DPH, Nozaki has prom ulgated th e mentorship tradition between the SPH and DPH; where he supervised Jam es Lee, a stude nt intern from the SPH from January through Septem ber, 2003. Lee is now starting his second year of dental school. W hile at the DPH, Lee assisted the epidem iologists with reporting HIV/AI DS and incorporating data entry into the state- run sentinel surveillance study. Lee also kept a running log of lab results, which included viral loads and CD4 counts/percentages. 10 The Epi Exchange bri ngs demiologists from across sout hern C alifornia to discuss current topics in epidemiology, including the spread or condi tion of vari ous di seases, new breakt hroughs i n conduct ing Sy ndrom ic Surveillance, and cases of specific dis eases that im pact the way in which ep idem iology protocols are conducted. The conference i nated by all sout hern C alifornia universi ments, organi zers have regul arly been m eeting in the Orange C ounty headquart ers. 43 D. Eileen Guerrero Eileen Guerrero, a doctoral student in Prev entive Care at the SPH, com pleted her field practicum with the Tobacco Use Reduction Now (TURN) program at the DPH from April to August 2003. Under the guidance of Kay Adkins, MP H, she participated in advocacy activities to advocate for the adoption of sm oke-free doorway policies in colleges and trade and vocational schools. 12 When Guerrero's practicum was com pleted, she was hired as a public service em ployee to help com plete the activities of TURN's objec tives for the 2001-2004 Scope of W ork. Nam ely, this focused on charting secondhand sm oke expos ure am ong patients in San Bernardino County, which ensured an increase in physicians advisi ng and prom oting sm oking cessation services for their patients. Currently, Guerrero is work ing toward m eeting an objective for the 2004-2007 Scope of W ork, which projects that by June 30, 2007, a m inimum of two key organizations, golf tournam ents, fairs, cultural or com munity ev ents in San Bernardino County will adopt and implem ent a policy to ban tobacco com pany sponsor ship. Guerrero is also aiding her colleagues in prom oting a 25% increase in com pliance with sm oke-free bars in three cities within the County by June 30, 2007. Guerrero's duties with TURN include re sponding to com munity requests for tobacco prevention education presentations or health fairs. W hile her colleagues have extensive community connections and experience with com munity health advocacy, Guerrero's training in program evaluation and research brings a different vantage point to the program . In the next year, Guerrero hopes to establish relationships with Asian and Pacific Islander com munity organizations in San Bernardino, who rem ain demonstrably absent as target groups for community health outreach efforts. E. Corw in Porter Corwin Porter, MPH, a Supervising Envir onmental Health Specialist with the DPH, earned his Master's degree in 2001 from the SPH with a dual concentration in Environm ental 11 See Section IV: Field Practica. 44 Health and Epidem iology. In 1999, Porter select ed the DPH Division of Environm ental Health Services to com plete his required Master's fi eld practicum , which focused on food-borne illness outbreak investigations.13 He later used findings and presenta tions f rom this project to train students and EHS staff on the correct procedur es for handling a food-borne illness outbreak. Currently, Porter also teaches a course at SPH, ENVH 515 Food Quality Assurance in the Environm ental and Occupational Health Program , for Dr. David Dyjack. Following the tradition of m entorship, Porter currently oversees the work of two SPH interns, Michelle Hoag and Jovianne Lewis, who cam e on board in June of 2004. Hoag's project involves the risk-based food inspection and gradi ng of food facilities, while Lewis' tasks center on the testing swim ming pools for harm ful chem icals. Porter' s com mittee m emberships include the In ternational Association for Food Protection and the California Environm ental Health Associa tion. On occasion, Porter delivers lectures to community groups, such as restaurant operato rs and cham bers of com merce. Annually, he delivers one-hour lectures at the SPH on how envi ronm ental health functions help protect the public's health, Jayakaran Job' s EPDM 544 course on Epidem iology of Infectious Diseases. F. Bruce Smith Bruce Sm ith, MD, MPH, an alum nus of the Lo ma Linda School of Medicine and SPH is the Medical Director of Maternal and Child Hea lth at the DPH. In 1994, Sm ith helped form a coalition of health prof essionals f rom several ins titutions interested in encouraging lactation to prom ote, protect, and preserve breastfeeding thr oughout the Inland Em pire. In addition, Sm ith is one of several DPH leaders actively engaged in the African Am erican H ealth Initiative (AAHI), a network of health service providers and com munity m embers com mitted to im proving the health of African Am ericans in the County. Smith has been an avid supporter of student training for the SPH for several decades. For instance, he coordinates an annual one-day vis it for undergraduate SPH students to the DPH to learn about public health and the functions of th e departm ent. Sm ith is also a regular guest lecturer for the MCH Epidem iology course, and currently serves on the com munity advisory board f or the departm ent of Global Health at the SPH. Furtherm ore, he has f acilitated num erous 12 See Section IV: Field Practica. 45 IV: Field Practica. SPH student field placem ents, oftentim es ta king students under his ow n wing, including Kofi Adade-Boafo, whose project assessed the effects of social support on infant m ortality from August 1997 to March 1998; Carolyn Melcher, on a breast-feeding research project entitled \"Investing in the Infrastructure\" from March 1998 to May, 1999; and Tonya Howard-Taylor, who helped devise a m odel in 1994/1995 for reducing fe tal lead poisoning in pregnant wom en seeking prenatal care from the DPH. The School of Public Health is considered th e Departm ent of Com munity Medicine at the Medical School, and m edical students are required to com plete half-day \"selectives\" in diverse areas ranging from restaurant inspection to HIV c linics. Sm ith is responsible for overseeing the selection of public health courses for m edical stude nts. In order to pass the selective portion of Ambulatory and Com munity Medicine, students m ust complete: two Public Health selectives; one Com munity Health selective; one other Hea lth selective; one Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation selective; one Derm atology selective, and two other selectives from any area. Public Health selectives include Epidem iology, HIV, Im munizations, STD/TB Food and tion. As part of the epidem iology selective, students' objectives are to understand the role of a county epidem iologist, basic disease surveillance system s, and im portant f actors in acute disease outbreaks. The HIV/STD clinic selective presents students with an overview of the clinical and legal procedures for diagnosing, treating, tracking, and reporting HIV and com mon STD's. The Im munizations selective is designed to help students understand the principl es of \"catch up\" im munizations, the econom ics of im munizations, and the recom mended pediatric and adult im munization schedules. Students at the TB clinic learn about the recom mendations for positive PPD treatm ent and its eradication. Com munity Health Services selectives incl ude Disability Care, Hom e Health, Hospice, Food Kitchen, Nutrition, Pharm acy Outpatient, and 12-Step Program s. Hom e Health's objectives are to: understand the basic principles of hom e visiting; understand the full range of services available through hom e health; and understand the funding m echanism s behind hom e health. In Nutrition courses, students: review basic caloric requirem ents and food categories; understand the basic principles of nutrition counseling; and ac quire at least four fo cused tools for nutrition counseling. The 12-Step Program s courses enable students to: understand the variety of 12-Step groups and program s available; review the 12 steps and understand their underlying philosophy; and list at least four tools used to acquire and m aintain sobriety. 46 Other Health Services courses include Alcohol Treatm ent Unit, Com plementary and Alternative Medicine, Health Care Adm inistrati on, Health and the Media, Health and the Law, Occupational Medicine, Prison Health, and School Health. G. Eric Frykman Eric Frykm an, MD, MPH, MBA, has been th e Chief of Disease Control and Prevention for the DPH since June 2001 and is currently servi ng as Interim Health O fficer for the County of San Bernardino. He has been actively involved in the developm ent of local response plans for bioterrorism and the local prevention of further threats to the public health. Frykm an graduated from the Lom a Linda School of Medicine in 1996, and com pleted his MPH in International Health from the SPH in 1999. Frykm an com pleted his Master's field prac ticum with the Social Action Com munity Health System (SACHS) Stop Sm oking Program , which serves an im poverished area in San Bernardino County. Frykm an conducted a survey to determ ine why the program been plagued by low attendance and retention. He com bined his survey results with previously collected demographic and sm oking-related data to perform the analyses. Apparent from the results was that the surveyed group, m ostly W hite fem ales, did not reflect the general SACHS patient population, com prised m ostly Hispanic fem ales. Analyses also revealed that com ponents m ost desired were group support, stress m anagem ent, and m edication access. Frykm an suggested that the program place an em phasis on increasing intra-clinic m arketing and word-of-m outh advertising to increase Hispanic attendance. Key projects that Frykm an has worked on include the 2001-2002 \"Madhu\" project on childhood anem ia; the Fall of 2001 Migrant Farm Worker Project; the Fall of 2001 assessm ent of high-risk pregnancies; the 1998 STD section on analyzing data for 1997-1998 6C/Chlor; and his 1998 work on com municable disease reporting while he was a resident at the DPH. 47 IV. FIELD PRACTICA The Master's field practicum is the apex of a student's educational experience and demonstrates both the research skills and the practical knowledge accrued by the student during his or her residence at Lom a Linda University.

SUMMARY The faculty of the Lom a Linda School of Public Health (SPH) and public service employees of the San Bernardino County Departm ent of Public Health (DPH) have recognized the m any benefits of their partnership in various collaborative projects, which have dem onstrated several ways of ensuring project sustainab ility in the com munity and prom oting f urther collaborations (e.g., inviting DPH speakers to lect at sem inars, or supporting field practicum placem ents at the DPH). One of the greatest strengt hs of such a partnership is the collaborative cross-training that occurs between research institutions, equipped with sophisticated methodologies and assessm ent practices, and public service institutions, who have extensive demographic inform ation at their disposal and con tinuously m onitor such data to scrutinize trends and rates of prevalence. In addition to pr oviding a solid foundation for training students (e.g. with the developm ent of field practica and inte rnships in association with the DPH and other community organizations), it has been dem onstrat ed that SPH students who are involved in this partnership are likely to take on im portant leadership and policy roles later in their careers. Additionally, the partnership between the SPH and DPH has resulted in the implem entation of policies that support com munity participatory health. This non-hierarchical model of com munity health planning, when eff ected by both research institutions and public agencies, provides a viable m eans of sustainab ility and program matic success, as evinced in the aforem entioned exam ples. Over the years, the partnership between the SPH and DPH has gained in m omentum and becom e influential in secu ring funding for various collaborative projects and tightening the gap between public health practice and education. Therefore, the ability to sustain an open dialogue and foster enduring alliances w ith each other is essential for both the SPH and DPH. 59 VI.
