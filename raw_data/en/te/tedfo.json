Three out of four of these live in low- and middle -income countries (LMICs) where mental disorders fail to attract enough resources to mitigate against the effects on opportunity, social inclusion and quality of life. In the context of increasing economic pressure brought by COVID -19 response and future recovery, external actors could unlock additional funds. This thesis therefore aims to identify who those external actors are in global mental healt h and to understand their roles so as to inform policy planning and sustainable financing. I use a multimethod research design. The first empirical chapter presents a new typology of external actors in global health, which is used to structure a systematic mapping of the evidence on external actors investing in mental health in LMICs. Findings reveal the existence of a large ecosystem of external organisations and individuals. Cognisant of the increased influence of philanthropy in global health, the second empirical chapter analyses trends in philanthropic development assistance for mental health (DAMH) in 156 countries between 2000 and 2015. Results suggest philanthropy plays a critical role, but my findings also highlight substantial inequalities. The thi rd empirical chapter analyses factors at recipient country -level potentially associated with DAMH allocation, using a two -part regression model applied to a time series cross -sectional dataset for 142 LMICs between 2000 and 2015. The analyses show that ext ernal actors' disbursements are not well aligned with mental health needs of recipient countries, and contextual factors might be playing more prominent roles in resource allocation. Finally, the fourth empirical chapter uses 35 elite interviews and docume ntary analyses to explore how and why external organisations have invested in mental health in LMICs over the last three decades and changes over time . Findings uncover numerous activities supported by external organisations, and factors shaping their deci sions at four levels (organisations, source and recipient countries, global landscape). Overall, this thesis underscores the important roles of external actors in sustainable mental health financing in LMICs. 7 Note on thesis structure This thesis conforms to the requirements of a PhD thesis from the Department of Social Policy of the London School of Economics and Political Science. It follows the format of a paper -based thesis, including at least three thematically linked papers of publishable standards, along with an introduction, a methodology and a conclusion. At least two paper s should be single authored, and the remaining papers first authored by the PhD candidate. This thesis is constituted by four empirical chapters (Chapters 3 to 6): two published , one in press and one to be submitted as a single -author journal paper.

Mental health needs are increasing and are likely to be exacerbated by the effects of lockdown and its socio -economic consequences (Nico la et al., 2020) . While this touches the entire population, immediate risk s are highest for people living with mental disorders, carers, and health professionals (Campion et al., 2020) . Evidence suggests that mental health services have already been disrup ted by the COVID -19 response, and few countries have included additional funding for mental health into their national COVID -19 response plans (WHO, 2020a) . In a recent policy brief, the United Nations emphasises the need to integrate mental health actions within the national response to COVID -19, in particular including mental health and social care for people with severe mental health conditions and psychosocial disabilities amongst essential services (UN, 2020) . With LMICs often already under economic pr essure, which will likely be worsened by COVID -19 response and recovery, external resources are urgently needed, now more than ever. This thesis provides insights on external investments in mental health in LMICs and recommendations for unlocking additiona l resources, which could inform the COVID -19 crisis response and recovery. I hope my pages will contribute to build back a more sustainable and resilient, a better, new world. 16 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1. Background Mental disorders (including substance use disorders, self -harm and dementia) account for a substantial proportion of the overall impact of ill -health (Patel et al., 2018) and generate high economic costs in low- and middle -income countries (LMICs) (Bloom e t al., 2011) . Their impact is expected to increase over time due to demographic and epidemiological transitions and growth in adverse social determinants of mental health such as inequalities (Patel et al., 2018) , which will likely be exacerbated by the downstream effects of COVID -19 and policy responses to it, and their social and economic consequences (Nicola et al., 2020) . However, mental disorders attract only limited resources: as little as 1.6% of government health budgets in LMICs (WHO, 2018b) and 0.4% of external development assistance for health (Charlson et al., 2017) . The United Nations (UN) (UNHRC, 2019) and mental health experts (Patel et al., 2018) have called for augmentation of resources, both domestically and externally. With LMICs often und er severe economic pressures, which will likely be worsened by COVID -19 response and recovery, external resources are urgently needed - now, more than ever. In this thesis, I examine external actors that invest in mental health in LMICs, analysing and ref lecting on their past, current and future roles to inform discussion on sustainable mental health financing. I differentiate between domestic and external actors, which encompass a wide variety of organisations (e.g. bilateral and multilateral governmental organisations) and individuals (e.g. high -net-worth individuals). External investments in mental health are defined to include all financial and non -financial (e.g. drugs and services in kind) contributions disbursed from external organisations or individ uals directly or through channel organisations into recipient countries with the aim of preserving or improving mental health (adapted from Charlson et al., 2017) . While the term investment is often used to refer to profitable financial ventures, I use it in a 17 broader sense to comprehend both profitable and non -profitable pursuits, and both financial and in -kind contributions . In line with the principles of local ownership and sustainability (UN, 2015a) , in this thesis I intentionally position recipient c ountries at the centre of the ecosystem of external actors and their investments (Han et al., 2018) , to reinstate and strengthen their centrality in policy planning and financing. Also, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015b) and to r eflect changes in the development finance landscape (Micah et al., 2019) , I recognise the role all countries can play as external actors for sustainable mental health financing, moving away from the obsolete North -South dichotomy between high - income donors and low - and middle -income recipients. In this chapter I set the scene for this thesis. I define mental disorders (section 1.2), describe the mental health burden (section 1.3) and mental health financing in LMICs (section 1.4), and provide an historical overview of external actors investing in mental health in LMICs (section 1.5). Subsequently, I introduce my research motivations (section 1.6), aim and questions (section 1.7), and outline the structure of this thesis (section 1.8). 1.2. Mental disorders Mental disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders including so -called common disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety disorders), severe disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), mental disorders in children (e.g. child behavioural disorders), neurodevelopmental (e.g. intellectual disability) and neurodegenerative (e.g. dementias) disorders, self -harm and suicide, epilepsy, alcohol and drug use problems (see Table 1.1) (WHO, 2008 b). Description (Neuro)developmental Disorders A group of conditi ons characterised by impairments in intellectual, movement, sensory, social, or communication abilities (e.g. autism, intellectual disability and cerebral palsy). Child Behavioural Disorders A group of conditions characterised by impairments of attention and disruptive behaviour (e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder). 18 Description Anxiety Disorders A group of conditions featuring excessive worrying, tension and fear, and ph ysical symptoms such as palpitations, headaches and sleep disturbances. Depression A condition characterised by low mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, fatigue and reduced energy, and sleep and appetite disturbances. Schizophrenia A condition chara cterised by distortions of thinking and perception (e.g. hallucinations and delusions), behavioural abnormalities and emotional disturbance. Bipolar Disorder A condition characterised by episodes of elevated or lowered mood and activity levels, often wi th complete recovery between episodes. Dementia A condition characterised by a progressive deterioration in mental functions, such as memory and orientation, leading to behavioural problems and loss of the ability to care for oneself and, ultimately death. Self-Harm and Suicide Intentional self -inflicted poisoning or injury which may lead to death. Alcohol Use Problems A group of conditions characterised by the consumption of alcoholic drinks to the level of causing harm to the person's health and social/personal relationships. Drug Use Problems A group of conditions characterised by regular use of substances such as opioids, sedatives or cocaine causing harm to the person's health and social/personal relationships. Table 1. 1. Mental disorders. Adapted from Patel et al. (2013, p.40) . Mental disorders impact multiple dimensions of the lives of people with mental disorders, their families (and carers), and society as a whole (Knapp & Iemmi, 2016) . People with mental disorders often need additional support from health and social care serv ices (e.g. community -based psychosocial support, hospital care in times of crisis, placements in residential facilities), amplified and complicated further by higher prevalence of physical comorbidities (Firth et al., 2019) . Children with mental disorders often require additional support at school (e.g. educational assistants in mainstream schools, specialist school placements). Adults with mental disorders are more likely than similar people without mental disorders to be unemployed and, when employed, to have higher rates of absenteeism (i.e. not being at work while unwell) and presenteeism (i.e. being at work while unwell), with important implications for lost productivity and earnings. In the most severe cases, they might struggle to live independently a nd may require placements in supported accommodation or residential facilities. People with mental disorders are more likely to be victims of violence and to commit criminal offences (the latter being less likely 19 than the former), with consequences for cri minal justice systems. In addition, people with mental disorders are often the victims of human rights abuses, such as long -term institutionalisation within psychiatric hospitals and prayer camps, sexual violence and forced sterilisation (UNHRC, 2017) . For instance, physical and emotional neglect and abuse have been reported against children with mental disabilities living in institutions (Mathews et al., 2013; P. Rodriguez et al., 2015) . Mental disorders often lead to long -term adverse personal consequenc es for both individuals and their families (including any carers), such as worsened health, quality of life and employment status, requiring differentiated support across the life course (Koenen et al., 2013) . For example, while people with developmental d isorders (e.g. intellectual disabilities) are usually diagnosed during childhood, they often need support over their entire lifetime. Similarly, while people with schizophrenia are more likely to experience the first symptoms during late adolescence, sympt oms generally recur many times over their lifetime and individuals are likely to require support in many dimensions of life. The complexity of mental disorders is increased by the substantial stigma affecting not only individuals with mental disorders and their families and carers, but also often the professionals working with them (Thornicroft, 2006; Thornicroft et al., 2007) . The risk of developing mental disorders and their adverse outcomes is influenced by multiple social determinants. These include de mographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity), economic circumstances (e.g. income, employment status, income inequality), neighbourhood (e.g. safety and security, housing), environmental events (e.g. war or conflict, natural disasters, climate c hange) and social and cultural factors (e.g. education, social support) (Lund et al., 2018) . Social determinants of mental health often operate in a vicious circle: poor social, economic, and neighbourhood characteristics increase the risk of developing or worsening mental disorders ( social causation ) and people with mental disorders are more likely to drift into poor social, economic, and neighbourhood adversities ( social drift ) (Iemmi et al., 2016; Lund et al., 2011) . 20 1.3. The size of the burden of mental dis orders High prevalence , premature mortality, and considerable disability characterise mental disorders. They affect one in four individuals over their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2009) , with broad variability across disorders and age groups: from about 1% fo r autism, 2 -3% for severe mental disorders, 6% for common mental disorders in children (increasing to 15 - 20% in adults) and 22 -30% for dementia in people aged 90 and over (Knapp & Iemmi, 2016) . Prevalence rates also differ across gender - e.g. depression i s more common for females at 5.1% versus 3.6% and suicide rates are higher for males (15 versus 8 per 100,000 population for females) (WHO, 2014, 2017a) - and settings (e.g. prevalence of mental disorders is as high as 22.1% in conflict -affected population ) (Charlson et al., 2019) . Mental disorders account for 2.3% of premature mortality (Whiteford et al., 2015) . Premature mortality particularly affects people with severe mental disorders, with a resulting life expectancy 10 to 20 years shorter than the g eneral population (WHO, 2015a) . People with mental disorders are at higher risk of physical ill -health, including higher risks of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (Firth et al., 2019) and are more likely to die due to unnatural causes, includ ing suicide, homicides and accidents: suicide accounts for about 1.5% of deaths worldwide (WHO, 2017a) . Collectively, mental disorders represent the most important cause of years lived with disability worldwide (28.5%) and the third leading cause of global burden of disease (10.4%) after cardiovascular and circulatory diseases (11.9%) (Whiteford et al., 2013 ; Whiteford et al., 2015) . Figures increase to 32.4% and 13% respectively when a broader definition of mental disorders is adopted to include chronic pain syndromes without musculoskeletal disorders (Vigo et al., 2016) . Rapidly growing since 1990 (Whiteford et al., 2015) , these figures are expected to increase further due to rapid demographic and epidemiological changes and growing adverse social determinants of mental health (Patel et al., 2018) , aggravated by COVID -19 and its policy responses suc h as stay -at-home orders leading to social isolation and restricted access to treatment (Hamadani et al., 2020) . 21 The burden of mental disorders is disproportionally borne by LMICs where over three - quarters of people with mental disorders live (Global Burd en of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018d) . The human toll in LMICs is also associated with a substantial economic cost, estimated at US$0.9 trillion in 2010 and expected to raise to US$2.1 trillion in 2030, about two -thirds of which attributable to produ ctivity losses (Bloom et al., 2011) . Those figures increase to US$3 trillion and US$8.9 trillion respectively when the intrinsic value of suffering and life are included using the value of statistical life approach (Bloom et al., 2011) . Effective interven tions are available (Patel et al., 2016a) , yet fewer than 10% of people with mental disorders in LMICs receive support (WHO, 2018b) . Not only are effective interventions available (Patel et al., 2016a) , but their cost can be as low as US$3 -4 per individual and their return on investment measured as benefit to cost ratios as high as 4 (i.e. each US$1 invested yields a return of US$4) (Chisholm & Saxena, 2012; Chisholm et al., 2016) . However, resources allocated to mental disorders are extremely limited. 1.4. Men tal health financing in low - and middle -income countries Financing responses to mental disorders in LMICs is complex and relies on a mix of domestic and external resources (Knapp & Iemmi, 2016) . Domestic resources for a LMIC originate from organisations an d individuals legally registered/resident within the country. Domestic mental health financing comprises as little as 1.6% of the total health budget on average (WHO, 2018b) and it mainly comes from two sources: pooled funding and out -of-pocket payments (s ee Table 1.2) (Dixon et al., 2006) . Pooled funding allows financial resources to be combined so that financial risks are spread across the population, perhaps in a redistributive way, so as to protect individuals from financial hardships and impoverishment due to (sometimes catastrophic) health care expenses (WHO, 2010c) . Pooled funding may be collected through three main mechanisms: taxation -based financing, social health insurance, and private health insurance. With taxation -based financing, resources are collected through compulsory taxes (on income, wealth, or products) which can be earmarked for specific services or sectors such as health care (e.g. in Azerbaijan, Kenya, Kyrgyz Republic, Zambia). This is the most common method of mental health financing : it is found in 72% of lower middle -income countries, 22 63.6% of upper middle -income countries, and 50% of low -income countries (WHO, 2005a) . In countries relying on social health insurance, resources are collected through compulsory wage -related contribut ions, usually paid by both employees and employers (e.g. in Mozambique) (Dixon et al., 2006) . This method of financing is found in 30.3% of upper middle -income countries and 8% of lower middle -income countries, but not in any low-income country (WHO, 2005a ). Countries using private health insurance collect contributions through voluntary enrolment, yet often exclude coverage of mental disorders (e.g. in Malaysia) (Dixon et al., 2006) . This is the least used method of mental health financing: it is found in only 3.6% of low -income countries and in no middle - income country (WHO, 2005a) . Out-of-pocket payments are often the only source of funding in countries with low availability of and difficult geographical access to services (e.g. Nepal, Pakistan) (Dixon e t al., 2006) . This method of mental health financing is found in 42.9% of low -income countries, 16% of lower middle -income countries, and no upper middle -income country (WHO, 2005a) . Recently, innovative mechanisms of domestic health financing have supplem ented resources raised through more traditional methods (WHO, 2010b) . The Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems produced an extensive list of these mechanisms, such as public -private partnerships and results -based financing (e. g. conditional cash transfers), yet their use for mental health is limited (Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems, 2009) .

LICs=low -income countries (%). LMCs=lower middle -income countries (%). UMCs=upper middle -income countries (%). 23 External resources for a LMIC originate from organisations and individuals legally registered/resident outside the country, including both high -income countries and other LMICs. External mental health financing in LMICs relies on multiple sources, includin g both organisations and individuals (e.g. high -net-worth individuals). External organisations encompass a broad variety of entities, such as development agencies (e.g. United States Agency for International Development), development banks (e.g. World Bank ), foundations (e.g. Wellcome Trust) and nongovernmental organisations (e.g. BasicNeeds) (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016) . While the types of external actors are numerous, their contributions are limited. For instance, development assistance for mental health (i.e. financial and in -kind contributions disbursed from donors through channel organisations into LMICs with the aim of preserving or improving mental health) accounts for as little as 0.4% of overall development assistance for health (Charlson et al., 2017) . Yet, their role and influence are growing. 1.5. External actors investing in mental health in low - and middle -income countries Over the last two decades, external actors have paid increasing attention to mental health in LMICs . Since the publication of its 2001 World Health Report, which focused on mental health, the World Health Organization's focus on the issue has ex panded (WHO, 2001b) . The World Health Organization (WHO) mental health atlases have for many years mapped mental health systems, including policies, service provision, and funding (WHO, 2001a, 2005a, 2007, 2011a, 2015b; WHO et al., 2005) , facilitated by th e WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO, 2005b, 2006, 2009, 2011b) . Since 2003, WHO has offered a package of 13 guidelines for mental health policy, planning and service development (WHO, 2020b) , and since 2008 has produced guidelines fo r treatment of mental disorders in low -resource settings through the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (WHO, 2008 b, 2010a, 2015c, d, 2016) . In 2013, WHO launched its Mental Health Action Plan 2013 -2020, setting objectives, targets and proposed actions for mental disorders at global and country levels, and calling for coordinated action from all stakeholders (WHO, 2013c) . Mental health has gained even greater prominence in global health fora and international organisations over the last few years. While m ental disorders were originally omitted 24 from the Millennium Development Goals (Miranda & Patel, 2005; UN, 2000; UNDESA & WHO, 2010) , in 2015 they gained a place (though small) within the new Sustainable Development Goals under the health goal (goal 3) thro ugh non -communicable diseases (target 3.4), substance abuse (target 3.5), and universal health coverage (target 3.8) (UN, 2015b) . Other Sustainable Development Goals make explicit reference to the inclusion of people with disabilities (including disabiliti es associated with mental disorders), while the principle of 'no one left behind' is emphasised across the entire Sustainable Development Goals agenda (UN, 2018a) . Moreover, UN agencies have recently strengthened the ir mental health response. In 2018 the U N Secretary -General Ant \u00f3nio Guterres launched a UN system -wide strategy on mental health and wellbeing for the UN workforce aiming to improve not only staff mental health but also knowledge, skills and behaviours (UN, 2018b) . More recently, the WHO Directo r-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus launched the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health to accelerate implementation of mental health support in 12 priority countries (WHO, 2019) . Yet, while gaining attention and importance in the development discou rse, mental health has attracted only limited resources from external actors. The World Bank made the case for increased investment in health in 1993 (World Bank, 1993) , but its funding has mostly targeted physical ill -health (Dieleman et al., 2015) . While development assistance for mental health has increased six -fold over the last two decades, it still accounts for the lowest share of development assistance for health across health conditions (Charlson et al., 2017) . Global investments in mental health we re galvanised by the Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health Initiative, launched in 2010 by the United States (US) National Institute of Mental Health and the Global Alliance for Chronic Disease in partnership with Wellcome Trust, McLaughlin -Rotman Centr e for Global Health, and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (NIMH, 2020) . The initiative laid out research priorities for improving mental health globally (Collins et al., 2011) , which informed Grand Challenges Canada's strategy for investments in mental health innovations across the globe (GCC, 2011, 2016) . Policy interest in mental health has grown further in recent years, but its translation into financial commitment has been modest. In April 2016, the World Bank and WHO held a 25 joint high -level meeting on global mental health to make the case for increased investments in mental disorders worldwide (Mnookin et al., 2016) . Soon after, the United Kingdom (UK) Department for International Development commissioned a technical report to review its mental health portfolio (G. Ryan et al., 2017) . In 2018, the UK co - hosted two high -level events: the first Global Disability Summit with Kenya and the International Disability Alliance (DFID, 2020) , and the first Global Ministerial Mental Health Summit in partnership with WHO and with the support of the Organisation for Economic Co -Operation and Development (OECD) (Department of Health and Social Care, 2020) . The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (2020) launched a mental health accelerator in 2019, aiming to build and strengthen a \"multi -sectoral response, catalysing government action, calling on corporations to make a commitment to mental health in the workplace, and tracking quality data to understand (our) progress in this area and hold (our) leaders accoun table\" . However, resources remain scarce and, building on previous demands (Chisholm et al., 2007) , both the UN (UNHRC, 2019) and mental health experts (Patel et al., 2018) have recently called for increases in resources for mental health, both domesticall y and externally. 1.6. Research motivation With LMIC governments already under economic pressure, external investments in mental health are urgently needed. This is in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (UN, 2015a) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015b) , which recommend the mobilisation of additional external funding while assuring sustainability through a gradual increase in domestic resources. There is, however, very little research on external actors investing in mental health in LMICs. In this thesis, I focus on three major gaps in the evidence base: ecosystem, allocation, and prioritisation. A first gap concerns the limited evidence on the ecosystem of external actors investing in mental health in LMICs, currently offering a partial pi cture. An Overseas Development Institute report based on a desk -review and key informant interviews provides an overview of key groups of donors for mental health in LMICs, emphasising the 26 prominence of state actors and the growing importance of some non -state actors, such as philanthropists, private sector foundations and organisations using innovative financing mechanisms (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016) . A RAND Europe report maps mental health research funders globally, including some organisations disbursing to LMICs, such as the Wellcome Trust and Grand Challenges Canada (Pollitt et al., 2016) . Similarly, the allocation of external funding to mental health in LMICs has received limited attention. I have found five studies that highlight the low size of devel opment assistance for mental health (Charlson et al., 2017; B. Gilbert et al., 2015; Liese et al., 2019) , especially the poor targeting of mental health in children and adolescents (Lu et al., 2018; Turner et al., 2017) . Only one study reveals the small pr oportion of disbursements relative to needs, with less than US$1 of development assistance for health per disability - adjusted life year (DALY, i.e. year of healthy life lost) targeting mental disorders, compared to US$144 for HIV/AIDS, for example (Charlso n et al., 2017) . Building on a previous study (Saraceno et al., 2007) , Mackenzie and Kesner (2016) identify four main reasons for underinvestment: lack of understanding of mental disorders, difficulties in measuring return on investment, stigma associated with the conditions and competing priorities (e.g. communicable diseases). While factors associated with disbursements of development assistance have been studied extensively (Peiffer & Boussalis, 2015) , evidence on disbursements to mental disorders is lac king. Finally, evidence on the prioritisation of external investments in mental health in LMICs is scarce . An earlier policy analysis explains the failure of mental disorders in attracting the attention of policy makers and funders globally (Tomlinson & Lund, 2012) . Two linked papers describe the scarcity of humanitarian assistance for mental health (Persaud et al., 2018a) and propose an index to facilitate its allocation based on compassion, assertive action, pragmatism, and evidence (Persaud et al., 201 8b). More recently, a multimethod study analysing mental health financing challenges and opportunities in four LMICs highlights strategies for increasing external resources, such as expanding commitments from existing actors and exploring interests of pote ntial new ones (Chisholm et al., 2019) . Another study uses situation analysis supplemented by key informant interviews to report on the positive impact of external contributions for mental health in Uganda, while 27 cautioning about their volatility, as they are often linked to donor interests and diplomatic relationships (Ssebunnya et al., 2018) . To my knowledge, no study has yet explored prioritisation of mental health in external organisations' investments in LMICs. 1.7. Research aim and questions In light of t he policy relevance of and the literature gaps on external actors investing in mental health in LMICs , the central question addressed by this research is: To what extent do external actors invest in mental health in low - and middle -income countries? The study aims to address this question by answering four subsidiary research questions: 1. Who are the external actors investing in mental health in low- and middle -income countries and what are their roles? 2. What is the role of philanthropic external actors investing in mental health in low- and middle -income countries ? 3. What factors are driving allocation of development assistance for mental health? 4. How and why have external organisations invested in mental he alth in low- and middle -income countries ? 1.8. Thesis outline I structure this paper -based thesis into seven chapters. Table 1.3 provides an overview of the key contributions of this research. In Chapter 2 , I detail the research methodology: a description of t he research paradigm; the use of multimethod to address central and subsidiary research questions; preliminary work informing the study design; ethics, safety, and data security issues; and critical reflections on my positionality and reflexivity. In Chapt ers 3 to 6, I report four empirical studies addressing the four subsidiary research questions. Chapters 3 and 4 have been published in BMJ Global Health (Iemmi, 2019a) and Global Mental Health (Iemmi, 2020a) respectively, and Chapter 6 is currently in pres s with Lancet Psychiatry . Each empirical chapter follows a similar structure: a short abstract; an introduction contextualising the topic within the literature; a methods section detailing methodological choices; a results section reporting findings from t he 28 analyses; a discussion of the results in the context of previous research, including study limitations and policy and research recommendations; and concluding remarks. Supplementary material at the end of each empirical chapter - generally not included in the published versions of these pieces of work - adds methodological depth and further details to substantiate findings. Chapter 3 has been published in BMJ Global Health (Iemmi, 2019a) . In this chapter, I describe how I developed a new typology of ext ernal actors in global health and used it to organise and interpret the evidence on external actors investing in mental health in LMICs . Chapter 3 addresses the first gap (ecosystem) and the first subsidiary research question: Who are the external actors i nvesting in mental health in low- and middle - income countries and what are their roles? Chapter 4 has been published in Global Mental Health (Iemmi, 2020a) . Cognisant of the increasing importance of philanthropy in global health, in this chapter I seek to understand the role of philanthropy in mental health in LMICs analysing trends in philanthropic development assistance for mental health in 156 countries between 2000 and 2015. The chapter is guided by the first gap (ecosystem) but addresses the second subsidiary research question: What is the role of philanthropic external actors investing in mental health in low- and middle -income countries ? In Chapter 5 , I aim to advance the literature on resource allocation for sustainable mental health financing in LMICs , identifying factors driving allocation of development assistance for mental health. The chapter addresses the second gap (allocation) and third subsi diary research question: What factors are driving allocation of development assistance for mental health? In this chapter I empirically analyse factors at recipient country level (needs, interests, policy environment) associated with allocation of developm ent assistance for mental health using a two -part regression model applied to a time series cross -sectional dataset of 142 LMICs between 2000 and 2015. Chapter 6 is currently in press with Lancet Psychiatry . The purpose of this chapter is to explore prior itisation of mental health in external organisations' investments in LMICs. 29 This chapter addresses the third gap (prioritisation) and the fourth subsidiary research question: How and why have external organisations invested in mental health in low- and middle-income countries ? In this chapter I use 35 elite interviews and documentary analyses to examine how and why external organisations have invested in mental health in LMICs over the last three decades and how this has changed over time. Finally, in Chap ter 7 I bring together the findings and contributions of the research described in this thesis. After a summary of the objectives and findings of this study, the chapter provides me with an opportunity to discuss the contributions of the work to the eviden ce base, and to reflect on the policy implications. Finally, I examine the strengths and limitations of my study and outline future research directions. 30 Research Question Research Gap Contributions Chapter Who are the external actors investing in mental health in LMICs and what are their roles? Ecosystem Substantive : A large ecosystem of external actors investing in mental disorders in LMICs already exists; they present opportunities for unlocking additional resources. Methodological : New typology of external actors in global (mental) health. 3* What is the role of philanthropic external actors investing in mental health in LMICs? Ecosystem Substantive : Philanthropy plays a crucial role in global mental health, yet it represents a small sh are of philanthropy for global health. 4* What factors are driving allocation of development assistance for mental health? Allocation Substantive : International donors' disbursements are not well aligned with mental health needs of recipient countries, and contextual factors (e.g. gross domestic product per capita, disease outbreaks) might be playing more prominent roles in resource allocation. Methodological : Example of the application of methods commonly used in the development assistance literature to development assistance for mental health. 5 How and why have external organisations invested in mental health in LMICs? Prioritisation Substantive : External organisations invest in mental health i n LMICs through numerous internal and external activities and two investment strategies (stand -alone and integration in existing programmes); actors play a prominent role in shaping organisational decisions. Methodological : Analytical framework to study p rioritisation amongst external organisations investing in global (mental) health in LMICs. 6* Table 1. 3: Key contributions of this research. LMICs= low- and middle -income countries. *Chapters 3 and 4 have been published in BMJ Global Health (Iemmi, 2019a) and in Global Mental Health (Iemmi, 2020a) respectively. Chapter 6 is currently in press with Lancet Psychiatry . 31 Chapter 2 Methodology To understand the role of external actors investing in mental health in LMICs , I use a pragmatic paradigm and a multimethod research design with qualitative and quantitative components. As this thesis is a collection of papers, my research met hods are described in detail in each empirical chapter, within the methods section and the supplementary material. In this chapter, I describe and critically reflect on the overarching research paradigm (section 2.1), the use of a multimethod approach to a ddress the central research question (section 2.2), preliminary work informing the research design (section 2.3), ethical considerations (section 2.4), safety and data security issues (sections 2.5 - 2.6), and my positionality and reflexivity (section 2.7). 2.1. Pragmatic research paradigm I adopt a pragmatic research paradigm, allowing me to choose the most suitable methods for each research question considering data availability and other research issues (e.g. ethics, time, resources) (Weaver, 2018b) . Hence, m y understanding of reality (ontological position) was constantly negotiated through this study and my reason of belief (epistemological stand) supported by the most suitable research methods (Weaver, 2018a) . 2.2. Multimethod research design I use a multimethod research design with qualitative and quantitative components (see Table 2.1). The qualitative component comprises typology -generation and systematic mapping (Chapter 3), and in -depth interviews and documentary analyses (Chapter 6). The quantitative compon ent includes trend (Chapter 4) and regression analyses (Chapter 5) of time series cross -sectional datasets. In the literature the terms multimethod and mixed methods are often used interchangeably, yet they differ (Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016) . Mixed meth ods is a third research paradigm integrating qualitative and quantitative methods to reach a deeper and more robust understanding of often complex social 32 problems by combing different viewpoints (Johnson et al., 2007) . Multimethod studies are using complementary methods to address a common research goal (Anguera et al., 2018) .

The cumulative and iterative research process means that components inform each other (see Figure 2.1) (Anguera et al., 2018) . The new typology and the mapping of the evidence of external actors in global mental health inform research design an d interpretation of results of the remaining empirical chapters (Chapters 4 to 6). In -depth interviews and documentary analyses inform methodological choices and interpretation of results of the quantitative component (Chapters 4 and 5). The quantitative a nalyses inform the content and interpretation of findings from the in -depth interviews and documentary analyses (Chapter 6). Cross -pollination across chapters is possible because of the common research goal, not a mixed methods research design that would h ave required integration of methods at three levels: study design, methods, and interpretation and reporting (Fetters et al., 2013) . 33 Figure 2. 1: Cumulative and iterative research process. In addition, I draw on 'accidental ethnography', a method consisting in \"paying systematic attention to the unplanned or 'accidental' moments in the field\" to gain a better insight into the research context and the researcher's positionality (L.A. Fujii, 2 014, p.526) . This has allowed me to pay systematic attention to 'accidental' moments outside my Quantitative Component Qualitative Component Chapter 3: Typology -Generation & Systematic Mapping Chapter 6: In-depth Interviews & Documentary Analyses Chapter 4: Trend Analyses of Time Series Cross -Sectional Dataset Chapter 5: Regression Analyses of Time Series Cross -Sectional Dataset 34 structured methods: expert meetings,2 concomitant work opportunities,3 and numerous conferences and public events on global mental health, sustainable financi ng, and philanthropy.4 Finally, I consulted regularly with multiple experts in global mental health over the whole period of my study to inform my methodological choices, to identify participants for in - depth interviews, and more generally to help in th e interpretation of my results. This engagement has contributed to ensure not only theoretical and methodological validity, but also relevance and robust ethical standards. To situate my work within a larger and fast-moving context, I have been monitoring current discussions and innovations in development finance through relevant mailing lists and newsletters, in particular in climate finance, a field attracting increased attention and funding. 2.3. Preliminary work To inform my research design, I conducted so me preliminary work. First, I mapped current and potential external actors in global mental health using scientific and grey literature, and websites of key international organisations and fora. I searched both scientific and grey literature, starting from two scientific papers (Charlson et al., 2017; B. Gilbert et al., 2015) and one report (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016) , then snowballing their reference lists and tracking citations using Google Scholar. I conducted additional searches in purposefully selected websites.5 2 Amongst meetings: Inter national Alliance for Mental Health Research Funders annual meeting (Vienna, Austria, 15 -16 February 2018), United for Global Mental Health and Lion's Head Global Partners consultative meetings on financing global mental health (London, UK, May -June 2018), UN and United for Global Mental Health consultative meeting on financing global mental health (New York City, US, 24 July 2018), WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme Forum (Geneva, Switzerland, 11 -12 October 2018), Global Mental Health Action Network (f ormerly Blue Print Group for Global Mental Health ) bi-annual meeting (London , UK, 9 September 2020) and monthly telephone meeting s (May 2018 -present ). 3 Amongst work opportunities: co-authoring a report on entry points for investments in mental health in LMICs for the UK Department for International Development (G. Ryan et al., 2017) and technical advice to the Global Innovation Fund. 4 Amongst conferences: invited presentations at the World Health Summit (B erlin, Germany, 9 -10 October 2016) and the 5th Global Mental Health Summit (Johannesburg, South Africa, 8 -9 February 2018). 5 Websites of UN agencies, Organisation for Economic Co -Operation and Development (OECD, 2020a, b, c) , Development Finance Internati onal (DFI, , SDGsfunders (Candid, 2020b) , Candid (former Foundation Center) (Candid, 2020a) , and Mental Health Innovation Network (MHIN, 2020) . 35 Second, I mapped 'key events' in global mental health and relevant ones in global health, development and development finance. I defined events to include global resolutions (e.g. 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) (UN, 2006) , policy plans and guidelines (e.g. Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013 -2020) (WHO, 2013c) , high -level meetings (e.g. 2016 WHO and World Bank meeting on Global Mental Health) (World Bank, 2020b) , and changes in the organisational landscape (e.g. 2011 launch of Grand Challenges Canada's Global Mental Health Program) (GCC, 2011) . Searches were conducted in the grey literature, such as reports and government documents (e.g. Tsutsumi et al., 2015; WHO, 2013c) , and websites (e.g. UN agencies). Third, to inform the quantitative component (Chapters 4 and 5), I mapped time series cross -sectional datasets used in global health and development, searching scientific and grey literature, and websites of key international organisations (e.g. WHO, World B ank) and research centres (e.g. Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, IHME). To identify relevant variables and assess their theoretical and methodological strengths and limitations, I sought dataset manuals and illustrative examples of their use in the scientific literature, ran descriptive statistics to gauge data form and completeness, and approached dataset owners for additional information and data. For instance, I obtained from IHME two sets of supplementary data for the dataset on development assistance for health: a detailed version including values omitted in the publicly available dataset (i.e. values greater than US$0 but less than US$500, or less than US$0 and greater than - US$500), and disaggregated data for US foundations (see Chapters 4 and 5). Similarly, I obtained supplementary data on philanthropy for global mental health from OECD, which provided me with an aggregated dataset of philanthropic disbursements for activities including the key words mental h*, psycholog*, and psychiatr*. Due to strict confidentiality agreement with data providers, it was not possible to secure activity -level data and the IHME dataset was preferred for the analyses (see Chapter 4). Appendix 2.1 provides further details regarding the selection of the dataset on development assistance for mental health . 36 2.4. Ethics Before initiating data collection, I obtained ethical approval from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) Research Ethics Committee (see Appendix 2. 2). This aimed to ensure high eth ical standards and adherence to received principles for research: respect for people, beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, fidelity, and academic freedom (Farrimond, 2013) . The quantitative component did not raise any ethical or legal issue because I used publicly available country -level data. The main ethical concerns regarded the qualitative component, in particular data collection and use of in -depth interviews. I obtained informed consent from participants in writing or orally ahead of each interview. The informed consent form, shared with them by email and/or in person, included two sections: an information sheet describing the research study and a consent form (see Appendix 2. 3) (WHO, 2017b) . At the beginning of the interview, participants were remin ded about data anonymity and confidentiality, the possibility to contact me and the LSE Research Ethics Committee with any queries, and that no adverse consequences would followed from a decision not to participate, not to answer some questions, or to with draw after the interview. Anonymity of interview data was preserved at three points. When allowed by participants, I collected data using two digital recorders when interviews were conducted face -to-face or via telephone, and a digital recorder and Quick Time Player when via Skype, along with interview and field notes. During data analyses, I transcribed digital recordings verbatim along with notes and allocated them an identifier. Participant names and identifiers were saved in a file kept in a separate f older. During writing, I omitted names of participants and their organisations and anonymised interview quotations. While some participants agreed to be identified, I decided to disclose only organisation groups and countries to protect anonymity, as few p eople (and sometimes only one person) within each organisation were eligible for interview. 2.5. Safety The fieldwork for this thesis was conducted in London (UK) where I was based, Geneva (Switzerland), Johannesburg (South Africa), New York City (US), and Vienna (Austria). 37 After consultation with the LSE Health and Safety team, risk assessment forms and eme rgency plans were submitted to the LSE PhD Academy and approval for travels outside the UK obtained. Ahead of each travel, emergency plans were also shared with the LSE Department of Social Policy, my supervisors, and my next of kin. Due to the low - and mo derate -risk environments where this thesis was conducted and the use of non - sensitive research design and data, I only encountered customary safety issues such as personal and research equipment safety, vaccinations, and health insurance coverage. 2.6. Data s ecurity and confidentiality Before initiating data collection and after consultation with the LSE data protection officer and Information Management Technology team, I outlined a detailed Data Management Plan which was submitted to and approved by the LSE Research Ethics Committee (see Appendix 2. 2). For the quantitative component, I stored the datasets and analyses in a password -protected computer. For the qualitative component, I scanned notes and informed consent forms soon after their collection, and tr ansferred them along with the digital recordings in Microsoft OneDrive. Transcriptions of digital recordings and notes were similarly saved in separate folders in Microsoft OneDrive. Digital recorders, original notes, and informed consent forms were kept i n a locked cabinet in my office at the LSE. During the thesis, I regularly backed -up all data from both quantitative and qualitative components in an encrypted external drive. I was the sole person with access to the raw data: I conducted the interviews, transcribed them verbatim (when recording was allowed by participants) along with the interview and field notes, analysed them, and wrote the final paper (Chapter 6). While the copyright and intellectual property ownership of the original datasets used for the quantitative component stay with the original providers, those of data collected through in -depth interviews lie with me. 2.7. Positionality and reflexivity Positionality \"ref ers to the stance or positioning of the researcher in relation to the social and political context of the study - the community, the organization or the participant group\" which impacts the whole research process from the finalisation of research questions to dissemination of results (Coghlan & Brydon -Miller, 2014, p.628) . Both qualitative and quantitative components were influenced by my positionality as a 38 woman, Caucasian, European, non -native English speaker (speaking four languages), trained in clinical psychology and health policy, with over 10 years of experience in mental health policy and practice research, and affiliated to a university in the Global North (Jafar, 2018) . Influenced by my positionality, reflexivity sheds a light on the process of kn owledge production (Maton, 2003) . My training in clinical psychology and health policy situated this study at the intersection of social science disciplines and fields, including global health, public policy, economics, international development and psycho logy. This was an important asset especially during in -depth interviews as it allowed me to adapt content and form to participant characteristics. Having over 10 years of previous experience in mental health policy and practice research, my knowledge and s kills along with my established professional network put me in a privileged position to approach the central research question of this study through its multiple facets and to interpret results from a position of experience. For instance, being an 'insider ' favoured access to interview participants and experts consulted to inform methodological choices and interpretation of results (Mikecz, 2012) . My affiliation to a prestigious university in the Global North provided me with the necessary credibility to a pproach institutions owning datasets used in the quantitative component and elite individuals for in -depth interviews. As a woman, power imbalances during elite interviews might have been increased especially vis -\u00e0-vis men (Boucher, 2017) . To minimise powe r asymmetry, ahead of the interviews, I collected information on participants and their organisations by searching scientific and grey literature, as well as institutional websites (e.g. scientific papers, charters, strategic plans, policy and financial reports, public statements). While being a non -native English speaker contributed to an increase in power asymmetries, positioning myself as an 'outsider' vis -\u00e0-vis native English speakers, it also positioned me as an 'insider' vis -\u00e0-vis non -native English s peakers favouring trust and rapport. My knowledge of four languages (English, French, Italian, Spanish) allowed me direct access to non -English literature and the use and understanding of different cultural codes and references during in -depth interviews. Being Caucasian and European might have influenced in -depth interviews by positioning 39 myself as an 'insider' vis -\u00e0-vis the majority of participants who, given my research focus, were from the Global North. Finally, the ascent of mental health on the agend a globally during the period of this study meant that keeping up to date with developments in the field was crucial. Throughout this study, I followed current developments using different media: scientific and grey literature, relevant mailing lists, socia l media and continuous engagement with the global mental health community (see section 2.2). 40 Chapter 3 Sustainable development for global mental health: a typology and systematic evidence mapping of external actors in low -income and middle - income countries6 Abstract Mental disorders account for a substantial burden of disease and costs in low -income and middle -income countries (LMICs), but attract few resources. With LMIC governments often under economic pressure, an understanding of the external funding landscape is urgently needed. This study develops a new typology of external actors in global health adapted for the sustainable development goals (SDGs) era and uses it to systematically map available evidence on external actors in global mental health. The new typolo gy was developed in line with conceptualisation in the literature and the SDGs to include 11 types of external actors for health in LMICs. Five databases (EconLit, Embase, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycINFO) were searched for manuscripts published in peer -reviewed journals in English, French, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish between 1 January 2000 and 31 July 2018 and reporting information on external actors for mental disorders in LMICs. Records were screened by abstract, then full -text against inclusion crite ria. Data were extracted and synthesised using narrative analysis. 79 studies were included in the final review. Five were quantitative studies analysing the resource flow of development assistance for mental health globally over the last two decades. The remainder were qualitative studies providing a description of external actors: the majority of them were published in the last decade, focused on Africa, and on public sector (bilateral and multilateral governmental organisations) and third sector organisa tions (nongovernmental organisations). Evidence was particularly scarce for for -profit organisations and individual households. This study reveals opportunities for unlocking additional funding for global mental health in the SDG -era from an ecosystem of e xternal 6 A version of this chapter was published with the following reference: Iemmi, V.

Further research is needed to understand all external actors and the allocation of their contributions in different settings. 3.1. Introduction More than 1 billion people live with mental disorders (including substance use disorders, self-harm and dementia) (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018d) , over three -quarters of whom live in low -income and middle -income countri es (LMICs) and their number is projected to increase (Patel et al., 2018) . Although effective and low -cost interventions are available (Patel et al., 2016b) , fewer than 10% receive support (WHO, 2018b) . Resources are scarce: mental disorders receive as lit tle as 1.6% of LMIC government health budgets (WHO, 2018b) and 0.4% of development assistance for health (Charlson et al., 2017) . The Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development recently called for an increase in resources to addr ess mental disorders, both domestically and externally (Patel et al., 2018) . With most LMIC governments already under considerable economic pressure, external funding is urgently needed. In line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (UN, 2015a) , the United N ations SDGs recommend the mobilisation of additional external funding from a wide range of sources (e.g. development assistance, foreign direct investments (FDIs), remittances) while assuring sustainability through local ownership and a gradual increase in domestic resources (UN, 2015b) . It is therefore important to identify who those key external actors are in global mental health. However, evidence is extremely limited. A rapid review on actors in global mental health, emphasises the prominence of donor states and identifies some non -state donors, such as philanthropists, private -sector foundations, and organisations using innovativ e financing mechanisms (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016) . Another study mapping the ecosystem of global mental health research funders includes some actors disbursing to LMICs, such as Wellcome Trust and Grand Challenges Canada (Pollitt et al., 2016) . 42 This study has two aims: first to develop a typology of external actors in global health adapted for the SDG -era; second to use this typology to systematically map the evidence on external actors in global mental health in order to identify available evidence and opportunities for unlocking additional resources. 3.2. Methods 3.4.1. Typology of external actors in global health To date the ecosystem of potential actors in global health has been explored either from a health governance or from a health financing perspective. The g lobal health governance literature explores power relationships of a growing plurality of external development actors and the emergence of non -state actors (e.g. philanthropic organisations, private industry, civil society organisations, global health init iatives) alongside state actors (e.g. donor country governments, United Nations organisations, multilateral development banks) (Frenk & Moon, 2013) . By contrast, the global health financing literature focuses mainly on donors, using a simplified path of resource flows from donor organisations representing the primary source of funding (e.g. states, private industry, philanthropic organisations, individ uals), through channel organisations disbursing funding to implementing institutions providing support in recipient countries (e.g. development aid agencies, nongovernmental organisations) (McCoy et al., 2009) . The combination of the two perspectives, howe ver, is yet to be done. I propose a new typology of actors in global health adapted for the SDG -era which includes a wide range of external actors (see Figure 3.1). The new typology brings together the two aforementioned approaches: global health governan ce and global health financing. On the one hand, the plurality of actors from the global health governance literature allows an understanding of each actor not only as its own entity, but also as operating within a group of organisations sharing common cha racteristics, and part of a larger ecosystem. On the other hand, expanding the definition of channel organisations from the global health financing literature, in the new typology external actors include organisations and individuals not only channelling d evelopment assistance but also investments to institutions providing goods and services in LMICs. 43 Figure 3. 3: Typology of external actors in global health: four overarching groups and their types of actors. DFIs=development financial institutions. GOs=governmental organisations. SMEs=small and medium enterprises. First, I identified 11 types of organisations and individuals from the literature in global health governance and global health financing (see Box 3.1). Second , I selected four overarching groups of financial actors in line with conceptualisations in the literature and in the SDGs (UN, 2015b) : public sector, private sector, third sector and multisector partnerships. Those groups were introduced to fa cilitate both the understanding of commonalities (e.g. legal status and modus operandi ) across actors and comparison with corresponding domestic actors. Finally, organisations were ordered by group. 44 Box 3. 1: External actors Public sector Governmental organisations in high -income and middle -income countries provide goods and services in LMICs, in agreement with recipient country governments. Bilateral governmental organisations in agreement with recipient countries are funded by just one state and include aid agencies (e.g. United States Agency for International Development) and other governmental agencies investing in development (e.g. ministries of foreign affairs or their equivalents, research councils). Multilateral governmental organisations are funded and composed by multiple states at the regional (e.g. European Commission), international (e.g. Colombo Plan), or global level (e.g. World Health Organization). Development finance institutions (DFIs) are organisation s offering financial products (e.g. loans) in contexts where commercial banks would not usually invest, due to what might be perceived to be high political, socioeconomic or environmental risks. Bilateral DFIs are funded by just one state and provide finan cial products usually at a commercial rate (e.g. United States Overseas Private Investment Corporation). Multilateral DFIs provide financial products usually at facilitated rates and are funded by multiple states, at the regional (e.g. African Development Bank), international (e.g. Islamic Development Bank) or global level (e.g. World Bank). Private sector Corporations and small and medium enterprises are for -profit organisations providing goods and services through foreign investments and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Foreign investments include foreign direct investments (FDIs), foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) and commercial loans. FDIs are substantial physical investments and purchases usually made by corporations in another cou ntry. FPIs are foreign indirect investments made by corporations, financial institutions and private investors using both equity (e.g. stocks) and debt instruments (e.g. bonds). CSR includes financial and in -kind contributions, in both products and human r esources. Foundations include non -profit organisations either created and mainly funded by private -sector companies (e.g. Microsoft Philanthropies) or created by wealthy individuals 45 and their families and funded through gifts of shares or endowments (e.g. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) (Stuckler et al., 2011) . They are often grant -making entities. Individual households contribute through donations, including financial and in kind - contributions in goods or services, and private foreign investments. A small number of individuals are described as 'high -net-worth': individuals with financial assets grea ter than US$1 million. A different and larger group of individuals are diaspora movements, including almost three -quarters (186 million) of international migrants coming from LMICs (UNDESA, 2017) . Third sector Third sector organisations constitute the mos t heterogeneous group of non -profit organisations providing goods and services in LMICs. Among others, this group includes nongovernmental organisations (e.g. BasicNeeds), professional associations (e.g. World Psychiatric Association) and research centres (e.g. universities). Multisector partnerships Multisector partnerships are a similarly heterogeneous group of organisations arising from arrangements between actors from two or more sectors aimed to leverage additional funding for global health, usually for specific conditions. Amongst others, this group include global health initiatives (e.g. Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) and innovation funds (e.g. Dementia Discovery Fund). 3.4.2. Systematic evidence mapping I used systematic evidence mapping instead of systematic review and meta -anal yses because this was more appropriate for identifying actors given the extent of available evidence, not the strengths and directions of relationships or tracking funding (Miake -Lye et al., 2016) . The only quality criterion was publication in scientific j ournals. I followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA -ScR) (see Supplement 3.1). I systematically searched five medical and social sciences databases (EconLit, Embase, Global Healt h, 46 MEDLINE, PsycINFO) for manuscripts published in peer -reviewed journals in English, French, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish between 1 January 2000 and 31 July 2018. Searches were run in August 2018. The search strategy was designed for MEDLINE combining M eSH terms with keywords for mental disorders, external actors, and LMICs, and then adapted for each database (see Supplement 3.2 for full search strategy). Mental disorders were defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition to include common and severe mental disorders, mental disorders in children, substance use disorders, self -harm and suicide, and some neurological conditions (dementia, epilepsy) (WHO, 2008 b). External actors included all actors external to recipient countries as de scribed in the new typology. LMICs were defined according to the World Bank classification (World Bank, 2018) . To be included, manuscripts had to report information on external organisations or individuals providing financial or in -kind contributions to m ental disorders in LMICs (e .g. actor description, contributions, activities funded). Contributions had to target either people living with mental disorders, their families and other carers, or populations at risk (e.g. people living with human immunodefici ency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome, HIV/AIDS). Manuscripts had to be original articles using any study design or other scientific publications (personal communications, commentaries, letters and editorials). Grey literature was ex cluded. Supplementary searches included snowballing citations from the reference lists and tracking citations using Google Scholar. The database searches identified 2300 records (see Figure 3.2). After removing duplicates, the title and abstract of 2011 records were screened against the inclusion criteria using EndNote X8 (Thomson Reuters, 2016) . Out of the 163 full -text articles assessed for eligibility, 50 were included in the review. The supplementary searches led to the inclusion of 29 additional records. I extracted data from the eligible manuscripts, including: publication characteristics (author, year), study characteristics (mental disorder, population, country, study type), and contributions from external actors (type of organisation, activities and revenues mobilisation). For quantitative studies only, additional study characteristics (dataset, years covered, type of analysis) were extracted. 47 Data were extracted in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, 2 013) . Narrative analysis was used to synthesise findings. Figure 3. 4: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses flowchart. 3.3. Results Five (Charlson et al., 2017; B. Gilbert et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2018; Tol et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2017) of the 79 studies analysed the resource flows for development assistance for mental health (DAMH) only, defined as financial and in -kind contributions disbursed from donors through channel organisations into LMICs with the aim of preserving or improving 2300 records identified through databases searches 2011 records screened 163 full -text articles assessed for eligibility 50 studies included (identified through databases searches) 79 studies included 29 studies included (identified through supplementary searches: citations snowballing and tracking) 113 full -text articles excluded 1848 records excluded 289 duplicate records removed 48 mental health (see Table 3.1). They were published over the last decade, had a global geographical focus, and included data on organisations from the public sector (bilateral and multilateral governmental organisations, multilateral development institutions) , private sector (foundations), third sector (nongovernmental organisations) and multisector partnerships (global health initiatives). They focused on disbursements for health activities only (Charlson et al. , 201 7), humanitarian activities only (Tol et al ., 2011) , or activities in multiple areas (e .g. health, humanitarian, education, government and civil services) (B. Gilbert et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2018; Turner et al., 2017) (see Supplement 3.3 for data extraction table of quantitative studies). The rem aining 74 studies provided a description of the external actors and funded activities. Over three quarters of them were published in the last decade. The majority of them focused on the African region (n=17) or globally (n=15). Public and third sector orga nisations were the most studied, in particular through bilateral and multilateral governmental organisations and nongovernmental organisations respectively. Studies focused mostly on contributions to activities of capacity -building, service provision, and research and research capacity -building (see Supplement 3.4 for data extraction table of qualitative and other studies). The next sections describe in details evidence on global trends in external contributions for mental disorders in LMICs from quantitati ve studies and on each group of external actors from all studies.

Global trends Despite the sixfold increase in DAMH over the last two decades, in 2015 mental disorders still received a small proportion of development assistance for health (0.4%, US$132 million), accounting for less than US$1 of development assistance for healt h per disability -adjusted life year (i .e. year of 'healthy' life lost) compared with, for example, US$144 for HIV/AIDS (Charlson et al., 2017) . A study that also included disbursements to non-health sectors found a similar mean annual estimate (0.7%, US$13 4 million), of which 48% was directed to humanitarian assistance, education and governments (B. Gilbert et al., 2015) . Among populations at higher risk of mental disorders, as little as 13% (US$190 50 million) of DAMH disbursed between 2007 and 2015 targeted children and adolescents, mainly in humanitarian contexts (Lu et al., 2018) . Similar estimates (17%, US$88 million) were found in another study (Turner et al., 2017) . Among humanitarian assistance disbursed between 2007 and 2009, only a tiny propo rtion (0.1%, US$226 million) targeted programmes including mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) (Tol et al., 2011) . 3.4.2. Public sector Bilateral governmental organisations accounted for 18% (US$222 million) of DAMH disbursed by channel organisations between 2000 and 2015 (Charlson et al., 2017) . They supported global mental health through programmes targeting their priority countries and areas, and including activities spanning mental health system capacity, mental health service provisions, humanitar ian response, advocacy and research. For instance, the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) funded numerous activities including mental health policy development in Kenya (Kiima & Jenkins, 2010) , community -based mental health s ervices in Nepal (Raja et al., 2012) and research into primary mental health care across Africa and South Asia (Lund et al., 2012) . The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) supported the integration of mental health into primary care after the 2003 conflict in Iraq (Sharma & Piachaud, 2011) and capacity -building and research in Zimbabwe through the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in collaboration with the US National Institute of Health (Hakim et al., 2018) . The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) contributed to mental health reform after the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992 -1995), funding capacity -building and research capacity -building in mental health (Lagerkvist & Jacobsson, 2001) . Multilateral governmental organisations accounted for 18% (US$228 million) of DAMH disbursed by channel organisations between 2000 and 2015, over two -thirds of which was by United Nations agencies (Charlson et al., 2017; Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018d) . They supported global mental health through normative and programmatic work, with activities linked to their missions an d priorities. 51 For instance, WHO developed the Mental Health Action Plan 2013 -2020 and clinical guidelines for mental health treatment in non -specialised settings (Saxena et al., 2014) . United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) was the biggest contributor to DAMH for children and adolescents in the health sector between 2007 and 2014, principally through psychosocial support in child friendly spaces (Turner et al., 2017) . The International Organization for Migration provided MHPSS and capacity -building activi ties in humanitarian and emergencies settings, such as conflicts in Nigeria and South Sudan (Schinina et al., 2016) and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti (Schinina et al., 2010) . At the regional level, the Pan American Health Organization promoted deinstitution alisation in Latin America and the Caribbean (J. J. Rodriguez, 2010) , and the European Commission research and research capacity -building in Africa and South Asia (Thornicroft & Semrau, 2018) . No evidence was found on contributions of bilateral developmen t finance institutions (DFIs) to global mental health. Multilateral DFIs accounted for 1% (US$14 million) of DAMH disbursed by channel organisations between 2000 and 2015 (Charlson et al., 2017) , contributing to global mental health through technical advic e and programmatic work linked to their priority countries and areas. For instance, the World Bank supported the reconstruction of better mental health services after the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992 -1995) (Lagerkvist & Jacobsson, 2001) and res earch in Sri Lanka (Siriwardhana et al., 2011) . At the regional level, the Inter -American Development Bank supported the evaluation of mental health services reforms in Latin America and the Caribbean along with other stakeholders (Caldas de Almeida, 2005) . 3.4.3. Private sector Limited evidence was found on corporations and small and medium enterprises. Among transnational and multinational companies investing in health care in LMICs, pharmaceutical industries were the most profitable, with the top three also active in the market of psychotropic drugs: Pfizer (USA), Johnson & Johnson (USA), GlaxoSmithKline (UK) (Outreville, 2007) . United States' companies were the major player in the hospital sector in LMICs (Outreville, 2007) . No evidence was found on FDIs for health insurance or 52 health technologies (e.g. Apps) except for drugs. Similarly, no evidence was found on foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) or commercial bank loans for global mental health. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) -supported activities in global mental heal th were aligned to areas of expertise of the businesses or the interests of their employees. For instance, multinational alcohol corporations are increasing presence in LMICs, such as Diageo in India (Esser & Jernigan, 2015) and SABMiller in South Africa (Babor et al., 2015) . SABMiller partnered with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) to provide HIV education and counselling to heavy drinkers in South Africa (Babor et al., 2015) . Other companies supported humanitarian response a nd reconstruction, such as Nestl\u00e9, Holcim and Sika with psychosocial support in schools after the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, China (Sim, 2011) . Foundations created and predominantly funded by private sector companies invested in global mental health through activities linked to the parent company or the interests of their employees, while foundations created by wealthy individuals and families wer e more aligned to the interests of their founders. In 2015, foundations disbursed less than US$10 million to DAMH directly to implementing organisations in LMICs, and potentially a much larger amount through other channels (Charlson et al., 2017) . For inst ance, between 2000 and 2015 Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) disbursed 85% (US$11 million) of DAMH through nongovernmental organisations and United Nations agencies (Charlson et al., 2017) . Among foundations created by private sector companies, Lill y Foundation supported a global collaboration on diabetes and depression aiming to raise awareness and improving diagnosis and treatment (Sartorius & Cimino, 2012) . Among foundations created by wealthy individuals, BMGF funded psychosocial support for chil dren affected by the 2010 earthquake in Haiti (B. Gilbert et al., 2015) , MacArthur Foundation activities of a civil society in global mental health in collaboration with other partners (The Lancet, 2009) and Wellcome Trust research and research capacity -building in LMICs (Prince et al., 2004) . 53 No evidence was available on individual households, both for donations and foreign investments to global mental health, including private FDIs and FPIs. Similarly, no evidence was available on contributions from the diaspora through remittances allocated to mental health or from the smaller group of high -net-worth individuals. 3.4.4. Third sector Third sector organisations supported and often delivered activities covering many aspects of global mental health, from advocacy to service provision, humanitarian response and research. In 2015, international nongovernmental organisations disbursed US$54 million to DAMH as channel organisations (Charlson al., 2017) . Among the numerous nongovernmental organisations, BasicNeeds (now part of Christian Blind Mission, CBM) received funding from DFID to deliver community -based mental health services in Nepal (Raja et al., 2012) , and CBM partnered with the local government to scale -up community -based mental health services in Niger (Hwong et al., 2015) . Carter Center (Gwaikolo et al., 2017) and International Medical Corps (Jones et al., 2007) provided psychosocial support and collaborated with local governments to 'build back better' mental health systems after the 2014 -2015 Ebola outbreak in Liberia and the 2004 tsunami in Aceh (Indonesia), respectively. A large number of nongovernmental organisations, including CBM, Doctors of the World, Doctors without Borders, Handicap International (now Humanity and Inclusion), members of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and Partners in Health, delivered MHPSS activities after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti (Raviola et al., 2013) . Grand Challenges Canada, a non -for-prof it organisation primarily funded by the government of Canada, committed US$19 million for innovations in global mental health (Gulland, 2012) . 3.4.5. Multisector partnerships Limited evidence was found on global health initiatives. Between 2007 and 2015, GFATM disbursed as channel organisation US$551 million to DAMH for children and adolescents, focusing on psychological support for individuals living with or at risk of contracting AIDS/HIV (Tol et al., 2011) . For instance, GFATM supported services for illicit dr ug users in Thailand (Kerr et al., 2005) and physical and psychosocial support for individuals living 54 with HIV/AIDS in sub -Saharan Africa and East Asia (Raguin, 2016) , the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases research in global mental health (Baingana et a l., 2015) . 3.4. Discussion This new typology illuminates the ecosystem of external actors in global mental health. This is crucial in the new landscape of the SDG -era: the plurality of actors requires good understanding of each of them, not only as single enti ties but also as part of a larger ecosystem. The majority of the evidence focused on the public and third sector, with almost two -thirds of DAMH disbursed to LMICs through the third sector. Evidence on the private sector and multisector partnerships is sca rce or inexistent. Overall, evidence remains very limited for a number or reasons. First, across sectors, studies have focused primarily on donors. However, many investors are already active in global health. In the public sector, DFIs' annual commitments grew from US$10 billion in 2002 to US$70 billion in 2014 (Savoy et al., 2016) , though health care attracted a small (2% -3%) share of investments (Kenny et al., 2018) , which could have included investments in mental health care. For instance, United States Overseas Private Investment Corporation invested in private health care businesses in sub -Saharan Africa and South Asia through health care funds (OPIC, 2019) . In the private sector, FDIs represent the largest (39%, US$671 billion) external source of fina nce in LMICs, more than three times the contributions from official development assistance and other official flows (11%) (UNCTAD, 2018) , though the amount directed to health care is small (Smith et al., 2009) and to mental health is unknown. Second, none of the studies explored the role of individual households. The wealth of high -net-worth individuals amounts to over US$70 trillion and is expected to reach US$100 trillion by 2025 (Capgemini, 2018) . Among the members of the Giving Pledge, a group of wealthy individuals committed to donate more than a half of their wealth, Bill Gates committed US$100 million of personal investments to fight dementia (Kelland, 2017) . Moreover, over the last decade contributions from a larger group of individuals, diaspora movements, through remittances increased to US$429 billion in 2016 and are expected to grow further (Ratha et al., 2018) . They represent the second most important 55 source of external financing in LMICs (24%) and are responsible for more than twice the amount of official development assistance and other official flows (UNCTAD, 2018) . While remittances could unlock additional resources in global mental health, examples are difficult to find. Third, studies have foc used on external actors from high -income countries. External actors from other LMICs are gaining power in global health, in particular middle -income countries. For instance, official development assistance for health from China was estimated at US$1.6 bill ion between 2000 and 2013, focusing predominately on health infrastructures, supplies and drugs in Africa and Asia (Tang et al., 2017) , though evidence on mental health is lacking. Fourth, comparison of financial estimates across studies requires consideration of limitations due to the use of different datasets and methodologies. Studies in this review used three datasets: the development assistance for health database (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation) (Charlson et al., 2017) , the aid activities dataset from the Creditor Reporting System (Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development) (B. Gilbert et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2018; Tol et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2017 ), and the Financial Tracking Service (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) (Tol et al., 2011) . Estimates may vary as different datasets capture different information (e .g. actors, sector of activities) (Grepin et al., 2012) and may employ different methodologies to identify and compute estimates from the same source (Pitt et al., 2018) . In particular, different methodologies influence financial estimates for programmes that tackle multiple health conditions. Fifth, a limited number of funding instruments were used in the studies included in this review (grants, technical assistance, in -kind contributions). However, the use of both financial instruments from the private sectors and innovative financial instruments is growing i n global health (Atun et al., 2017) . For instance, the World Bank is currently considering issuing social purpose bonds for global mental health (World Bank Group, 2018) . The venture capital fund Acumen is facilitating investments in health in LMICs, such as affordable health insurance in Kenya and hospitals and emergency medical care 56 for the lower income groups in India (Acumen, 2019) , though not yet in mental health. Investment -based crowdfunding platforms are facilitating investments in health (potential ly including mental health) (Renwick & Mossialos, 2017) , although with very limited presence in LMICs. Sixth, allocations of funding to global mental health were often limited to geographical allocation. Only one study reported misalignment of disbursemen t relative to needs, measured as burden of mental disorders (Charlson et al., 2017) . Similarly, development assistance for health has been found to be misaligned with disease burden (Dieleman et al., 2014) , with some conditions such as HIV/AIDS displacing other health funding priorities (Lordan et al., 2011) and more aid targeting conditions with more cost -effective interventions (Bendavid et al., 2015) . Seventh, funded activities focused primarily on treatment in health care and humanitarian or post -conflict settings. One study (Raja et al., 2012) reported on support for people with mental disorders in income -generating activities and another (Sim, 2011) on psychosocial support in schools. However, multiple dimensions of the lives of people with mental disorders, their families and other carers are affected and effective interventions are available. Those include support for children with intellectual disa bilities in schools, stress -reduction programmes in the workplace, and support for carers of people with dementia (Patel et al., 2016b) . Eighth, partnerships with domestic actors were numerous but often restricted only to external actors in the public and third sectors. For instance, Doctors of the World collaborated with the local government to provide and 'build back better' mental health services after the 2007 earthquake in Peru (Kohan et al., 2011) , and the Organisation of American States with the Uni versity of S\u00e3o Paulo to build research capacity on drugs in Latin America (Luis et al., 2004) . This reflects historical tensions in the field between biomedical and social explanations of and responses to mental disorders (Clark, 2014) . However, partnershi ps in global health are increasing in number and types of actors, allowing for pooling of a variety of resources and skills (Youde, 2014) , though posing new challenges such as in relation to accountability and sustainability. 57 Finally, few studies uncovere d by this review addressed ethical concerns, such as accountability, equity, and conflict of interests. Three studies analysed conflict of interests between corporations' investments and CSR initiatives (Babor et al., 2015) , accountability of partnerships (Matzopoulos et al., 2012) , and human rights abuses in funded programmes (Amon et al., 2014) . The financialisation of global health (i .e. the increase in size and influence of financial institutions and markets) introduces new ethical challenges spurred by financial motives (Stein & Sridhar, 2018) , such as conflicts of interest between global health foundations and food and pharmaceutical corporations (Sharma & Piachaud, 2011) , 'responsible banking' of the financial sector investing in global health (Krech et al., 2018) , and equitable access to private health care (Eren Vural, 2017) . Ethical concerns in global mental health are often limited to conflict of interests in practitioners (Fava, 2007) , while a systemic approach to ethical financing is lacking. 3.4.1. Limitations This study has limitations. Systematic searches in electronic databases were only run in English between 2000 and 2018 and included only manuscripts published in peer - reviewed journals in English, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. Given that the purpose of the study was to review external actors, those searches captured the main languages used for publications in high -income countries and many LMICs. The exclusion of grey literature made possible the introduction of a quality criter ion in the systematic mapping. Mental health was defined to include mental disorders only, excluding positive aspects and social determinants of mental health. Finally, the exclusion of external actors not providing financial or in -kind contributions, such as political leaderships and consultative fora, might have discarded an important influencer of disbursements. 3.4.2. Recommendations Mental disorders in LMICs require urgent political attention. Mental disorders account for a substantial proportion of the over all burden of poor health and high economic cost (US$0.9 trillion in 2010) (Bloom et al., 2011) , and their impact is expected to increase further due to projected demographic and epidemiological changes and an increase in (adverse) social determinants, suc h as economic inequalities and natural disasters 58 associated with climate change (Patel et al., 2016b) . The SDGs (UN, 2015b) and WHO Mental Health Action Plan 2013 -2020 (WHO, 2013c) provide an unprecedented framework for global action. Tools are available t o decision makers for designing better mental health system and services, such as the Mental Health Atlas (WHO, 2018b) , as well as guidelines for mental health policy, planning and service development (WHO, 2020b) , and for interventions in non -specialised settings (WHO, 2016) . However, the low resources allocated to mental disorders both domestically and externally hinder progress. With LMIC governments often at full capacity, external funding needs to be unlocked. The results of this review suggest a larg e ecosystem of external financial actors are already disbursing to global mental health, and untapped resources could be mobilised. However, drawing on this review, I suggest that the pluralism of actors requires five adaptations in order to achieve a sust ainable impact. First, a global coordination mechanism that involves all actors in global mental health should coordinate and monitor financial efforts over time, favouring partnerships and accountability. A global partnership for mental health (Vigo et a l., 2019) has been recommended by experts for coordinating efforts, and the recently launched Countdown Global Mental Health 2030 is expected to monitor progress towards decreased disparities in mental health across countries (Saxena et al., 2019) . Second, collaborations across actors should be preferred to the establishment of new organisations. For instance, while a multi -donor fund for non -communicable diseases and mental health has been proposed by the WHO Independent High -Level Commission on non -commun icable diseases (Nishtar et al., 2018) , its establishment could contribute to the fragmentation of efforts in global health. Third, local ownership and sustainability should be at the centre of funding decisions: mental disorders should be included in LMIC government priorities (Docrat et al., 2019) with an incremental approach for increasing domestic spending and coverage (Caddick et al., 2016) , external funding should be aligned with those priorities, and humanitarian and development funding coordinated (WHO, 2013a) . Fourth, it is paramount to collect better data that include contributions from all external actors in global mental health to favour planning and accountability. Finally, ethical considerations should be integrated into decision -making and monitoring processes in external financing 59 for global mental health. This could favour the establishment of partnerships across sectors while preserving core values in global mental health. Further research is needed to understand the role of external actors in global mental health, especially outside the public sector. Qualitative studies should map external actors for mental disorders in different settings, using the grey literature and this new typology to support consistency and inf orm comparisons. Studies tracking external resource flows should take a comprehensive approach and go beyond DAMH to include disbursements from other external actors. Quantitative studies should assess whether external funding for global mental health are allocated effectively, efficiently and equitably. Quantitative and qualitative studies should explore what financial instruments work in global mental health, including feasibility and acceptability in different local contexts, effectiveness, cost -effectiv eness, equitability, scalability and sustainability. Finally, studies that examine ethical issues related to external funding in global mental health are needed, in particular studies of the financialisation of global mental health. 3.5. Conclusion Addressing mental disorders in the SDG -era requires mobilisation of additional external funding from multiple sources, along with an incremental increase in domestic funding. Unlocking external funding is possible, but coordination of efforts across actors is crucial, and the use of a sustainable and ethical approach is a moral imperative. This study presents opportunities to engage with a multitude of external actors in global mental health. In addition, it suggests a new typology of external actors that c ould provide a helpful framework for future policy planning and research on sustainable development in global mental health and global health. 60 Supplementary material Supplement 3.1: PRISMA -ScR checklist SECTION ITEM PRISMA -ScR CHECKLIST ITEM REPORTED ON PAGE # TITLE Title 1 Identify the report as a scoping review. 40 ABSTRACT Structured summary 2 Provide a structured summary that includes (as applicable): background, objectives, eligibility criteria, sources of evidence, charting methods, results, and conclusions that relate to the review questions and objectives. 40 INTRODUCTION Rationale 3 Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known. Explain why the review questions/objectives lend themselves to a scoping review approach. 41 Objectives 4 Provide an explicit statement of the questions and objectives being addressed with reference to their key elements (e.g. population or participants, concepts, and context) or other relevant key elements used to conceptualize the review questions and/or objectives. 42 METHODS Protocol and registration 5 Indicate whether a review protocol exists; state if and where it can be accessed (e.g. a Web address); and if available, provide registration information, including the registration number. N/A Eligibility criteria 6 Specify characteristics of the sources of evidence used as eligibility criteria (e.g. years considered, language, and publication status), and provide a rationale. 42-45; Figure 3.1 ; Box 3.1 Information sources* 7 Describe all information sources in the search (e.g. databases with dates of coverage and contact with authors to identify additional sources), as well as the date the most recent search was executed. 45-46 Search 8 Present the full electronic search strategy for at least 1 database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated. Supplement 3.2 Selection of sources of evidence 9 State the process for selecting sources of evidence (i.e. screening and eligibility) included in the scoping review. 46 Data charting process 10 Describe the methods of charting data from the included sources of evidence (e.g.,calibrated forms or forms that have been tested by the 46 61 SECTION ITEM PRISMA -ScR CHECKLIST ITEM REPORTED ON PAGE # team before their use, and whether data charting was done independently or in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators. Data items 11 List and define all variables for which data were sought and any assumptions and simplifications made. 46 Critical appraisal of individual sources of evidence\u00a7 12 If done, provide a rationale for conducting a critical appraisal of included sources of evidence; describe the methods used and how this information was used in any data synthesis (if appropriate). N/A Synthesis of results 13 Describe the methods of handling and summarizing the data that were charted. 47 RESULTS Selection of sources of evidence 14 Give numbers of sources of evidence screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally using a flow diagram. 46-47; Figure 3.2 Characteristics of sources of evidence 15 For each source of evidence, present characteri stics for which data were charted and provide the citations. 47-49; Table 3.1 ; Supplement 3.3 - 3.4 Critical appraisal within sources of evidence 16 If done, present data on critical appraisal of included sources of evidence (see item 12).

N/A: Not applicable. *Where sources of evidence (see second footnote) are compiled from, such as bibliographic databases, social media platforms, and Web sites. A more inclusive/heterogeneous term used to account for the different types of evidence or data sources (e.g. quant itative and/or qualitative research, expert opinion, and policy documents) that may be eligible in a scoping review as opposed to only studies. This is not to be confused with information sources (see first footnote). The frameworks by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and Levac and colleagues (2010) and the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance (Peters et al., 2015; Peters et al., 2017) refer to the process of data extraction in a scoping review as data charting. \u00a7The process of systematically examining research evid ence to assess its validity, results, and relevance before using it to inform a decision. This term is used for items 12 and 19 instead of \"risk of bias\" (which is more applicable to systematic reviews of interventions) to include and acknowledge the vario us sources of evidence that may be used in a scoping review (e.g. quantitative and/or qualitative research, expert opinion, and policy document). 63 Supplement 3.2: Search strategy MEDLINE (Ovid) 1. exp Mental or epilep*).mp.

While over three -quarters of people with mental disorders live in low - and middle -income countries (LMICs) and effective low -cost interventions are available, resource commitments are extremely limite d. This paper seeks to understand the role of philanthropy in this area and to inform discussions about how to increase investments. Novel analyses of a dataset on development assistance for health were conducted to study philanthropic development assistan ce for mental health (DAMH) in 156 countries between 2000 and 2015. Philanthropic contributions more than doubled over 16 years, accounting for one -third (US$364.1 million) of total DAMH 2000 -2015. However, across health conditions, mental disorders receiv ed the lowest amount of philanthropic development assistance for health (0.5%). Thirty -seven of 156 LMICs received no philanthropic DAMH between 2000 and 2015 and just three LMICs (Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) received mo re than US$1 philanthropic DAMH per capita over the entire period. Eighty -one percent of philanthropic DAMH was disbursed to unspecified locations. Philanthropic donors are potentially playing a critical role in DAMH, and the paper identifies challenges an d opportunities for increasing their impact in sustainable financing for mental health. 4.1. Introduction Mental disorders (including substance use disorders, dementia and self -harm) are the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide (19%) (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018e) . While over three -quarters of people with mental disorders live in LMICs fewer than 10% receive treatment (WHO, 2018b) . Investments in mental disorders in LMICs are extremely limited: only 1.6% of LMIC gover nment health 7 A version of this chapter was published with the following reference: Iemmi, V. (2020) . Philanthropy for global mental health 2000 -2015. Global Mental Health , 7: e9. 89 budgets (WHO, 2018b) and 0.4% of development assistance for health (DAH, i.e. financial and in -kind contributions for health disbursed by donors to LMICs) (Charlson et al., 2017) . With LMIC government budgets often at capacity, it is paramount to mobilise additional external resources (Patel et al., 2018) . United Nations Sustainable Development Goals recommend external resources for development from a wide range of sources, including philanthropy (UN, 2015b) . Philanthropy includes contribution s from non -state actors such as foundations, corporations and individuals (Youde, 2018) . Over the last two decades their role and influence in global health has increased, bringing additional resources and innovative ideas along with concerns about legitim acy (Youde, 2018) and conflicts of interest (Stuckler et al., 2011) . While philanthropic contributions account for 17% of DAH (Dieleman et al., 2016) , they represent over one -third of DAMH (Charlson et philanthr opic DAMH in 156 countries between 2000 and 2015 to understand the role of philanthropy in this area and inform discussions about how to increase investments to address mental disorders. 4.2. Methods I merged the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IH ME) dataset on DAH 1990 - 2017 (IHME, 2018a) with three variables: country classification per region (WHO, 2018a) , per country income -level (World Bank, 2018) and country population size (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018c) . The IHME DAH d ataset reports estimates on primary sources of funding for 172 countries (1990 -2017), 24 governments and philanthropic donors (corporations, foundations, individuals) (IHME, 2018b) . Estimates are also provided on channels, defined as intermediary organisat ions disbursing funding to implementing institutions providing support in LMICs. These channels include bilateral governmental organisations (e.g. United Kingdom Department for International Development), multilateral governmental organisations (e.g. World Health Organization, WHO), multilateral development finance institutions (e.g. World Bank), nongovernmental organisations, United States (US) foundations and global health initiatives (e.g. Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria). US foundati ons can be either primary 90 sources or channels. Recipient countries are classified as unspecified by IHME when information is not available. I conducted descriptive analyses of philanthropic DAMH by year in absolute and relative terms, and compared with p hilanthropic DAH to other health conditions (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, other infectious diseases, maternal health, newborn and child health, non -communicable diseases excluding mental health), by channel organisation, and by recipient country. I lim ited analyses to 2000 -2015, due to poor data quality pre - 2000, preliminary estimates post -2015 and focus on the Millennium Development Goals era to inform the Sustainable Development Goals era, leaving 168 countries. I excluded 12 small overseas territorie s or dependencies due to the lack of World Bank country classification. Among excluded countries, only two received non -philanthropic DAMH during the period, Anguilla (2005) and the Cook Islands (2005 -2006 and 2008 -2012). Values are reported in 2017 United States dollars (US$) adjusted by purchasing -power parity. Analyses were conducted in Stata 14 (StataCorp, 2015) . Supplement 4.1 provides further details . 4.3. Results 4.3.1. Annual trends Between 2000 and 2015, philanthropic DAMH amounted to US$364.1 million, representing one -third of total DAMH (see Supplement 4.2). Philanthropic contributions within DAMH increased substantially, both in absolute terms (more than doubling from US$20 millio n to US$51.7 million) and in relative terms (30% to 45% of total DAMH; see Figure 4.1). By contrast, over the same period, philanthropic DAH represented a smaller (17%) and constant share of DAH (see Supplement 4.2). Over 16 years, mental disorders received the lowest amount (0.5%) of philanthropic DAH across health conditions (see Supplement 4.3). Newborn and child health (28%) and HIV/AIDS (17%) received the largest amounts. Over 16 years, philanthropic DAMH increased 2.6 -fold (US$20 million to US$52 million), slightly lower than the 3.3 -fold increase in philanthropic DAH (see Supplement 4.3). While philanthropic DAH experienced substantial changes over the period for some health conditions (e.g. 91 newborn and child health, HIV/AIDS), the increase was less sizeable for mental disorders (see Figure 4.2). 92 Figure 4. 1: Annual philanthropic DAMH as a percentage of total DAMH between 2000 and 2015 (million, 2017 US$). DAMH=development assistance for mental health. 93 Figure 4. 2: Annual philanthropic DAH across health conditions between 2000 and 2015 (million, 2017 US$). DAH=development assistance for health. 94 4.3.2. Channel organisations Between 2000 and 2015, nongovernmental organisations were the main channels of philanthropic DAMH (US$254 million), followed by US foundations (US$79 million) and multilateral governmental organisations (US$31 million) (see Supplement 4.4). Over 16 years, the proportion of philanthropic DAMH doubled for nongovernmental organisations (38% to 77%) but more than halved for foundations (3 2% to 14%) and reduced even more noticeably for multilateral governmental organisations (30% to 9%). Nongovernmental organisations were the main channels of philanthropic DAH (US$39,334 million) followed by US foundations (US$20,357 million), multilateral governmental organisations (US$8,901 million) and global health initiatives (US$3,847 million). Relative shares remained stable over the period. Among US foundations, Ford Foundation (US$11 million) was the largest channel for philanthropic DAMH over the period, followed by Simons Foundation (US$7 million) and Open Society Fund and Oak Foundation (US$6 million each) (see Figure 4.3). There were variations in the most generous US foundations channelling funding across regions and country -income groups ( see Supplement 4.5). Across regions, Ford Foundation was the largest contributor in four regions (Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, South -East Asia and Western Pacific), Open Society Fund in Europe and James S. McDonnel Foundation in the Americas. Similarly, Ford Foundation was the largest contributor in low -income (US$1.7 million) and lower middle -income countries (US$5.2 million), while James S. McDonnel Foundation was the largest in upper middle -income countries (US$2.9 million). 95 Figure 4. 3: Cumulative philanthropic DAMH by the top 40 US foundations as channels between 2000 and 2015 (million, 2017 US$). DAMH=development assistance for mental health. 96 4.3.3. Recipient countries The majority of philanthropic DAMH between 2000 and 2015 was disbursed to unspecified locations (81%) or multiple regions (10%) (see Supplement 4.6). Amongst known recipient countries, philanthropic DAMH varied across regions and country - income groups. It accounted for more than one -third of DAMH to both Western Pacific (US$11 million) and the Americas (US$12 million) unlike less than 5% to Eastern Mediterranean (US$3 million) and Africa (US$4 million). It represented over one -quarter of DAMH to upper middle -income countries (US$14 mil lion) but 5% to low -income countries (US$6 million). Across known recipient countries, philanthropic DAMH varied broadly. Over 16 years, China was the largest recipient (US$6 million), followed by the Philippines (US$4 million), Mexico (US$3 million) and B razil (US$2 million). However, considering per capita estimates, only three out of 156 LMICs received more than US$1 per capita over the entire period (Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) (see Figure 4.4). Thirty -seven countries received no philanthropic DAMH: nine African, four American, two Eastern Mediterranean, seven Eastern European, one South -East Asian and 11 Western Pacific countries (see Supplement 4.6). 97 Figure 4. 4: Cumulative philanthropic DAMH per capita in recipient countries between 2000 and 2015 (2017 US$). DAMH=development assistance for mental health. 98 4.4. Discussion The paper offers a detailed account of trends in philanthropic DAMH in 156 countrie s between 2000 and 2015. Philanthropic contributions represented one -third (US$364.1) of total DAMH, more than doubling over 16 years. However, across health conditions, mental disorders received the lowest amount of philanthropic DAH (0.5%). Philanthropic DAMH was mainly channelled through nongovernmental organisations (US$254 million). More than one -third of DAMH to Western Pacific and the Americas was philanthropic. The analyses suggest philanthropic contributions to mental disorders represented a small share of philanthropic DAH but had a substantial and increasing role in DAMH. These results highlight four main challenges for philanthropic DAMH: scarcity, sustainability, allocation and data. Philanthropic contributions to mental disorders were limited , accounting for a relatively small share of philanthropic DAH when compared to other health conditions, reflecting similar trends in high -income countries (Brousseau et al., 2003) . The substantial share of DAMH disbursed by philanthropy raises concerns regarding its sustainability, especially vis -\u00e0-vis volatility and fungibility (i.e. partial displacement of domestic health budgets). While volatility concerns reflect broader challenges in DAH (Moon & Omole, 2017) , philanthropy accounted for a lower share ( less than 10%) of DAH across regions and country -income groups. Fungibility of philanthropic DAMH is partly mitigated by large disbursements through nongovernmental organisations, which have been shown to have positive impacts on domestic government health spending (Lu et al., 2010) . The uneven allocation of philanthropic DAMH means that the region where the majority of people with mental disorders live, South East Asia (26%) (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018e) , received only 17% of ph ilanthropic DAMH, raising concerns about equitable allocation. A similar misalignment occurs with total DAMH (Charlson et al., 2017; B. Gilbert et al., 2015) and DAH (Dieleman et al., 2014) . While allocation of development assistance is determined by a var iety of factors beyond needs, including policy environment and donor interests (Hoeffler & Outram, 2011) , stakeholders recognise health needs as of primary concern (Ottersen et al., 2018) . Similarly, factors beyond needs drive philanthropic giving, includi ng solicitation, cost - 99 benefit, altruism, reputation, psychological benefits, values and efficacy (Bekkers & Wiepking, 2011) . Finally, data on philanthropic DAMH are extremely poor in coverage and quality. They focus predominantly on US foundations and they are often insufficiently disaggregated. For instance, organisation names at the source and channel level are available only for Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and US foundations, respectively. BMGF disbursing 15% of DAMH only as a channel (Charlson et al., 2017) suggests other US foundations could disburse potentially a much larger amount through other channels. This re flects the lack of transparency of philanthropic donors in development (OECD, 2018) . This analysis has limitations due to data constraints. First, data are limited in breadth, focusing predominantly on US foundations. While this may have excluded some ke y players, almost three -quarters of philanthropic contributions in development originate from the US (OECD, 2018) . Second, data are limited in depth, so that estimates are conservative for some organisations. For instance, IHME classifies DAH channelled through global health initiatives and some multilateral governmental organisations (United Nations Children's Fund, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS) to health conditions constituting the organisations' focus, although programmes may include me ntal health components (IHME, 2018b) . Third, data are limited in scope, focusing on health only. This may have excluded sectors directly or indirectly relevant to mental health (e.g. education, employment) (Lund et al., 2018) . Fourth, data are limited in granularity. For instance, the majority of contributions are disbursed to unspecified countries and no information is reported on activities funded and populations targeted, limiting interpretations. Finally, inclusion of some neurological conditions (epi lepsy, headache disorders, Parkinson's disease) reflects prior conceptualisation of mental disorders (WHO, 2008 b) and may have increased estimates. The analyses in this paper show that, among external actors (Iemmi, 2019a) , philanthropic donors are alrea dy playing critical, albeit limited and imperfect, roles in DAMH. I suggest four opportunities for maximising their impact. First, philanthropic 100 donors could initiate or increase contributions to mental disorders to reflect their growing relative importanc e as part of the epidemiological transition in LMICs (GBD 2017 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, 2018) . They could scale -up their efforts through their priorities and competitive advantages, as illustrated for 15 large international foundations by the Lancet C ommission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development (Patel et al., 2018, online Supplementary Table S5) . Second, in line with Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015b) and Addis Ababa Action Agenda (UN, 2015a) , they could adopt a sustainable approach to disbursements in order to assure local ownership and impact beyond funded activities. They could systematically encourage partnerships between implementing organisations and local actors to facilitate an incremental transition to do mestic delivery and funding (WHO, 2013a) . Third, philanthropic DAMH could be allocated within organisations' strategic roles and priorities, but more equitably across countries, reflecting local needs (e.g. burden of mental disorders) (Global Burden of Dis ease Collaborative Network, 2018e) , capacity (e.g. mental health system) (WHO, 2018b) and recommended interventions and approaches (Patel et al., 2016a) . Finally, philanthropic donors could increase transparency, collecting and sharing better and more disa ggregated data. This could inform the work of organisations tracking resources (IHME, 2018a; OECD, 2017) and monitoring global efforts in mental health (Saxena et al., 2019) , paramount for informing funding decision and ultimately for sustainable financing for global mental health. Additional external resources for global mental health are urgently needed: philanthropy is a crucial actor and could amplify its impact embracing greater sustainability, better allocation and transparency. 101 Supplementary material Supplement 4.1: Data sources and analyses Data sources I merged the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) dataset on development assistance for health (DAH) 1990 -2017 (IHME, 2018a) with three variables : country classification per region (WHO, 2018a) , per country income -level (World Bank, 2018) , and country population size (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018c) . DAH includes \"in -kind and financial resources transferred from primary development channels to low -income and middle -income countries for the purpose of maintaining or impr oving health\" (Dieleman et al., 2016, p. 2537) . The IHME DAH dataset reports semi -aggregated data on DAH in 172 countries between 1990 and 2017 (IHME, 2018a) . It reports estimates on resource flows from funding sources (see Supplementary Table 4.1.1), th rough channel organisations, defined as intermediary organisations disbursing funding to implementing institutions providing support in low - and middle -income countries (see Supplementary Table 4.1.2). The dataset is built by IHME using different sources: Development Assistance Committee and Creditor Reporting System databases (Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development), financial reports, audited financial statements, United States Agency for International Development Report of Voluntary Agenc ies, Foundation Center's grant database, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation online grant database, Internal Revenue Service 990 tax forms, and personal correspondences (Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network, 2018b) . These data, in an aggregated form, exists publicly on the Global Health Data Exchange (IHME, 2018a) . A detailed dataset was obtained from IHME in September 2018, including values omitted in the publicly available dataset (i.e. values greater than US$0 but less than US$500, or less than US$0 and greater than -US$500). In addition, disaggregated data for United States foundations (variable channel , category Other US Foundations in Table 2) were obtained in June 2018. 102 It is worth noting that development assistance for mental health in the IHME DAH dataset captures not only mental disorders (including substance use disorders, dementia, and self-harm) but also some neurological conditions (epilepsy, headache disorders, Parkinson's disease). This reflects previous conceptualisati ons of mental disorders (WHO, 2008 b). At the time of the analyses for this paper it was not possible to access data on development assistance for mental health excluding those neurological conditions.

Analyses I conducted descriptive analyses of annual philanthropic development assistance for mental health (DAMH) in absolute and relative terms, by channel organisation, by recipient country, and compared with philanthropic DAH to other health conditions (HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis, malaria, other infectious diseases, maternal health, newborn and child health, non -communicable diseases excluding mental health). Philanthropic donors included in the analyses are corporations, foundations, individuals (see Supplementary Tables 4.1.1 and 4.1.2). Analyses were limited to 2000 -2015, due to poor data quality pre-2000, preliminary estimates post -2015 and to focus on the Millennium Development Goals era to inform the Sustainable Development Goals era, leaving 168 countries. I excluded 12 small overseas territories or dependencies due to lack of World Bank country classification: Anguilla, Cook Islands, Mayotte, Montserrat, Nauru, Niue, Saint Helena, Saint Martin, Tokelau, Turks and Caicos Islands, Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna Isla nds. None of them received philanthropic DAMH. Only two countries received non - philanthropic DAMH during the period, Anguilla (2005) and the Cook Islands (2005 -2006 and 2008 -2012). To reflect disbursements to recipient countries dissolved or created during the period of study (Kosovo, Serbia, South Sudan), the World Bank country 104 classification was imputed using the first observation carried backward and the last observation carried forward. Transfers between channels captured elsewhere in the database wer e excluded to avoid double -counting. Values are reported in 2017 United States dollars (US$) adjusted by purchasing -power parity.

This is especially important in mental health where resources remain extremely limited. In this paper I investigate global collective action in mental health financing, looking at the responsiveness of international donors to mental health needs in low - and middle -income countries (LMICs). I analyse factors at the level of recipient countr ies (needs, interests, policy environment) associated with allocation of development assistance for mental health (DAMH) using a two -part regression model applied to a time series cross -sectional dataset of 142 LMICs between 2000 and 2015. Findings reveal that international donors' dis bursements are not well aligned with mental health needs of recipient countries, and, moreover, contextual factors might be playing more prominent roles in resource allocation. Countries are more likely to receive DAMH if they experience significant outbre aks of infectious diseases or have lower gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and market openness. Selected recipient countries are more likely to receive higher DAMH amounts per capita if they have lower competing health needs and lower GDP per capita, or higher government health expenditure. Past DAMH recipients are more likely to be selected and, when selected, to receive higher DAMH amounts per capita. My results demonstrate that more holistic collective action amongst international donors is urgentl y required to address mental health needs in LMICs. Investments should better reflect needs, particularly during and after emergencies such as COVID -19, and could be amplified by leveraging synergies across other health conditions and sectors. 5.1. Introductio n Collective action between international donors is central to global solidarity in global health (Frenk & Moon, 2013) , especially in mental health where resources are particularly scarce. Mental disorders (including substance use disorders, dementia, and self-harm) in 118 LMICs are on the rise and will likely be amplified by COVID -19 and policy response to it (Vigo et al., 2020) , while resources remain extremely limited (Patel et al., 2018) . A large network of international donors is contributing to address mental disorders in LMICs through DAMH, which includes both financial and in -kind contributions (see Chapter 3 ). The limited amount and inequitable distribution of DAMH (Charlson et al., 2017) threaten international donors' collective action. It is therefore important to understand factors driving resource allocation. Available evidence on factors driving DAMH allocation is extremely limited and suggests that international donors are not adequately responding to mental health needs in LMICs. While DAMH per disability -adjusted life year (DALY, i.e. lost 'healthy' life year) has increased almost fourfold between 1995 and 2015, mental disorders receive the lowest amount per DALY (US$0.85) acr oss all health conditions, albeit with variation across regions and income groups (Charlson et al., 2017) . DAMH per capita varies widely across regions (from US$0.02 in Asia to US$0.07 in Africa) and country groups (US$0.05 in low - income, US$0.02 in lower middle -income, and US$0.03 in upper middle -income countries) in 2011 (B. Gilbert et al., 2015) . Similar variation is observed for DAMH for children and adolescents (Lu et al., 2018; Turner et al., 2017) . Previous r esearch describes the scarcity of humanita rian assistance for mental health (Persaud et al., 2018a) and an index has been proposed to facilitate its allocation based on compassion, assertive action, pragmatism, and evidence (Persaud et al., 2018b) . A policy report identifies four main reasons for underinvestment in mental disorders in LMICs: lack of understanding of mental disorders, difficulties in measuring return on investment, stigma, and competing priorities (e.g. communicable diseases) (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016) . Development assistance for h ealth (DAH) provides relevant insights on potential factors likely to be associated with DAMH allocation. The evidence on DAH and health needs reveals a mixed picture: DAH is misaligned with some health indicators (e.g. burden of disease, although with muc h unexplained variation across countries) (Dieleman et al., 2014) , but positively associated with others such as infant and child mortality (Lee & Lim, 2014) , and HIV prevalence (Boussalis & Peiffer, 2011) . Contextual factors have been found to influence D AH allocation. Competing health needs and limited resources mean 119 that funding is often displaced: for example, HIV/AIDS has diverted resources away from malaria and health sector funding (but not from tuberculosis due to its links with HIV/AIDS) (Lordan et al., 2011) . Countries with higher economic needs, measured as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, receive higher development assistance for HIV (Sterck, 2018) . Trade interests influence allocation of development assistance by donor nations (Younas, 2 008) , while multilateral donors favour disbursements to countries with stronger institutional capacity (Dollar & Levin, 2006) . In this study, I empirically analyse factors in recipient countries associated with DAMH allocation using time series cross -sectional data on 142 LMICs between 2000 and 2015. I test whether international donors' disbursements are aligned with mental health needs of recipient countries, and the role of contextual factors in resource allocation. I focus on international donors as a group to illuminate their collective action and shared responsibilities. 5.2. Methods After selecting recipient -country factors likely to be associated with DAMH allocation, I created a new time series cross -sectional dataset by merging data from different sources. I then analysed the two stages of the DAMH allocation process using a two -part regression model, supported by sensitivity analyses and robustness checks. Finally, I reported descriptive statistics to chart trends over time in DAMH disbursements and mental health needs of recipient countries, and findings from the regression analys es. 5.2.1. Factors selection I selected factors representing recipient country characteristics likely to be associated with DAMH allocation and data sources through a review of the literature. Selection was complemented by 35 in -depth interviews with key informa nts working in international organisations that are prominent players in global health and experts in global mental health (see Supplement 5.1 and Chapter 6 ). Identified factors were included in the final model according to data availability, quality, and suitability for analyses. In line with previous conceptualisations of factors influencing development assistance (e.g. Peiffer & Boussalis, 2010) , I classified them into three groups: needs , interests , and policy 120 environment . DALYs for mental health per ca pita was used to measure mental health needs, percentage of DALY for other health conditions to measure competing health needs, and GDP per capita economic needs. For interests , trade as a share of GDP was used to measure market openness and donors' commer cial interests. For policy environment , government effectiveness was used to measure institutional capacity, and government health expenditure as a percentage of GDP government commitment to health as proxy for mental health. In recognition of their links with mental disorders (Charlson et al., 2019) , variables capturing humanitarian shocks (conflicts, natural disasters, disease outbreaks) were included. Hypotheses for each variable are reported in Table 5.1. Ethical approval was obtained from the London Sc hool of Economics and Political Science Research Ethics Committee (Ref. 000589) and informed consent from interview participants. 5.2.2. Data sources I developed a new time series cross -sectional (2000 -2015) dataset merging sources commonly used in the developm ent aid literature (see Table 5.1). Data for DAMH came from the DAH 1990 -2017 dataset published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) (IHME, 2018a) . The IHME DAH dataset reports semi -aggregated data in 172 countries between 1990 and 201 7. The dataset includes resources flows from funding sources (governments and philanthropy) through channel organisations (e.g. bilateral and multilateral organisations) to recipients (i.e. LMICs) (Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network, 2018b) . It includes disbursements to the health sector only and exclud es humanitarian assistance. Further details are provided in Appendix 2.1. The variable DAMH represents the amount of development assistance for mental disorders disbursed to a country in a particular year. According to the IHME definition of DAMH, mental health includes mental disorders, substance use disorders, dementia, self - harm, some neurological conditions (epilepsy, headache disorders, Parkinson's disease). DAMH per capita estimates ( hereafter labelled as DAMH pc) were derived using population data published by IHME (GBDCN 2018c) . To identify countries selected to receive DAMH, I created a dummy variable per DAMH selection (value 0 if DAMH was bigger than zero; value 0 otherwise). 121 DALYs were extracted from IHME Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 dataset (GBDCN 2018a) . To reflect th e IHME definition of DAMH, DALYs for mental health included not only mental disorders but also substance use disorders, dementia, self -harm, and some neurological conditions. Population data published by IHME (GBDCN 2018c) were used to derive per capita es timates (DALY for Mental Health pc). Percentage of DALYs for other health conditions (DALY for Other Health, %) represented the share of DALYs for all health conditions except mental disorders, substance use disorders, dementia, self -harm, and some neurolo gical conditions. GDP and trade as a share of GDP were sourced from the World Development Indicators dataset (World Bank, 2019a) . GDP represents the \"sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the country plus any product taxes and minus any sub sidies not included in the value of the products\" (World Bank, 2020a) . For consistency, GDP per capita figures (GDP pc) were estimated using population data published by IHME (GBDCN 2018c) . Trade as a share of GDP (Trade, %GDP) is defined as the \"sum of ex ports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of gross domestic product\" (World Bank, 2020c) . The government effectiveness index came from the World Governance Indicators dataset (World Bank, 2019b) . The index captures \"perceptions of the qu ality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies\" (Kaufmann et al., 2011, p. 223) . Scores range from -2.5 (weak) to +2.5 (strong) governance performance. Government health expenditure was sourced from IHME Global Health Spending dataset (Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network, 2018a) and includ es health care good and services, but not capital expenditure (e.g. buildings). Government health expenditure as a percentage of GDP (GHE, %GDP) was derived using GDP estimates sourced from the World Development Indicators dataset (World Bank, 2019a) . Variables identifying humanitarian shocks came from the IHME Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 Cause -Specific Mortality dataset (GBDCN 2018b) . Number of deaths attributable to conflicts (Conflicts, deaths) and number of deaths attributable to natural disast ers (Natural Disasters, deaths) were extracted from the dataset. In line with 122 previous research (GBD 2017 Causes of Death Collaborators, 2018) , I created a variable measuring deaths due to disease outbreaks (Disease Outbreaks, deaths) merging deaths by key infectious disorders: dengue, diarrheal diseases, Ebola, malaria, measles, meningococcal meningitis, Zika virus, and other unspecified infectious diseases. To identify major humanitarian shocks, I created a dummy variable per shock (value 0 if the annual number of deaths per country was less than 1000; value 1 otherwise) (Conflicts; Natural Disasters; Disease Outbreaks). The threshold was chosen in line with the Correlates of War project dataset, where 1000 battle -related deaths differentiates between war and minor conflicts (Gleditsch et al., 2002) . Logarithmic values of three variables were used to normalise their distribution (DAMH pc) or to facilitate interpretation (DALYs for Mental Health pc, GDP pc). Values were rebased to 2017 United States dollars (US$) adjusted by purchasing -power -parity (PPP) using the GDP deflator series published by the World Bank (2019a) . Supplement 5.2 reports descriptive statistics: summary statistics reveal few countries experiencing conflicts and natural disasters during 2 000-2015, and Pearson coefficients show statistically significant associations between independent and dependent variables. Data were missing for four variables: GDP per capita (1.5% of country -year data points), trade as a share of GDP (4.3%), government effectiveness (7.1%), and government health expenditure as a percentage of GDP (1.5%). Missing data were treated using multiple imputation (White et al., 2011) , the preferred method where values are assumed to be not missing at random (Lall, 2016) (see Su pplement 5.3).

DALYs=disability -adjusted life years. DAMH=development assistance for mental health. GDP=gross domestic prod uct. GHE=government health expenditure. pc=per capita. PPP=purchasing -power -parity. US$=United States dollars. 5.2.3. Model specification I used a two -part model (Cragg, 1971) to reflect the two stages of the resource allocation process (Stubbs et al., 2016) . For the first part, I used a pooled probit estimator to determine factors associated with the probability that a country received DAMH (selection equation). For the second part, I used a pooled Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) estimator on selected recipients to determine factors associated with the amount of DAMH received (allocation equation). The unit of analysis was recipient country -year. I used the following base specification of the two -part model, for the selection (1) and allocation (2) equations: ( =1 (1) =0 + 12 + 2 + 3 2+ + (2) where i is recipient country; t year; s lags; F cumulative distribution function; 0 and 0 intercepts; and regression coefficients for each independent variable; regression coefficient for the autoregressive term; X vector of independent variables represe nting needs, interests, and policy environment of the recipient country; W and Z vectors of independent variables representing humanitarian shocks in the recipient country as dummy and continuous variables respectively; year fixed effects; u error term. Supplement 5.4 reports the full equations. 125 The selection equation (1) is an autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) model using a pooled probit estimator. The dependent variable is a dummy variable for DAMH receipt by country per year, taking value one when the country receives DAMH and zero otherwise. A two -year lag is used for the autoregressive term and independent variables representing needs, interests, and policy environment of recipient countries. Independent variables capturing humanitarian shocks us e both one -year and two -year lags (conflicts, natural disasters) or one -year lag only (disease outbreaks) due to high multicollinearity with the two -year lag (Marquaridt, 1970) . I assumed a two -year lag to reflect information available to decision -makers a t the time of selection and allocation of DAMH (i.e. year preceding disbursements) (Neumayer, 2005) . I assumed an additional one-year lag for humanitarian shocks to account for the faster availability of information on emergencies and disbursement of emerg ency funds. In order to reflect the non -linear relationships between the dependent variable and DALY for other health conditions, a square term was added. The allocation equation (2) is a distributed lag (DL) model using a pooled OLS estimator. The depen dent variable is logarithm of DAMH per capita. The only differences with the selection equation (1) are lack of autoregressive term (which absorbed all variation), use of a dummy variable for DAMH selection with a two -year lag to capture new and old recipi ents, and use of continuous instead of dummy variables for humanitarian shocks. The clustered standard errors estimator was used in both equations to correct for serial correlation within recipient countries. Supplement 5.5 explains the choice of the estim ation approach. 5.2.4. Data analyses I first compared trends for DAMH and DALYs for mental health for 2000 -2015, and then carried out regression analyses for the two -part model. I estimated average marginal effects of coefficients in the first stage to facilitat e interpretation (Williams, 2012) . Next, I conducted analyses to test sensitivity of results to changes in model specification generally aiming for parsimony, and robustness checks: using different lags; excluding outliers using trimming (i.e. excluding th e first and 99th percentiles) or winsorising (i.e. 126 replacing extreme values with extreme percentiles); and using the original dataset with full data or complete cases. I limited analyses to the period 2000 to 2015 due to lack of accurate reporting for DAH before 2000 and availability of preliminary estimates only for DAH post -2015, leaving 166 countries. I discarded 26 countries and territories due to lack of data on variables of interest, leaving 142 LMICs in the analyses (full list in Supplement 5.6). Va lues are reported in 2017 PPP -adjusted US$. Analyses were conducted in Stata 15 (StataCorp, 2017) . 5.3. Results 5.3.1. Trends Findings reveal that DAMH began to decrease in 2013 after a first phase of increase in (low) disbursements, although DALYs for mental health continued to rise between 2000 and 2015 (see Supplement ary Table 5.7.1). The total level of annual DAMH increased five - fold between 2000 and 2015 for the 142 LMICs in the sample, with broad variations across years and countries. The median level of annual DAMH increased from zero to US$23,639 between 2000 and 2011, decreasing to US$13,117 in 2015, while median level of DALYs for mental health increased steadily over the same period (see Figure 5.1, Panel A) (see Supplement ary Table 5.7.2). Similarly, the median level of annual DAMH per capita increased slightly from zero to US$0.001 between 2000 and 2012, and started decreasing soon after, while DALYs for mental health per capita increased steadily (see Figure 5.1, Panel B) (see Supplement ary Table 5.7.3). All estimates are characterised by broad uncertainty (see Supplement ary Tables 5.7.2 and 5.7.3), a feature of analyses of this kind of data . Of course, there are potentially many other factors influencing disbursements as I will explore. 127 128 Figure 5. 1: DAMH and DALYs for mental health between 2000 and 2015, median (Panel A) and median per capita (Panel B). DALYs=disability -adjusted life years. DAMH=development assistance for mental health. pc=per capita. 5.3.2. Two -part model Results show that disbursements are not well aligned with total mental health needs of recipient countries, and contextual factors might be playing more important roles in resource allocation. Table 5.2 reports results from the main selection model (i.e. t he first part), including 1818 observations for 140 countries between 2000 and 2015. DALYs for mental health per capita were not associated with the probability of the country being a DAMH recipient ceteris paribus . The probability that a LMIC received DAM H was positively associated with two variables (disease outbreak , and past DAMH receipt) and negatively associated with two others (GDP per capita, and trade as a share of GDP). In particular, past DAMH receipt and disease outbreaks were associated with hi gher probability of receiving DAMH. A 1% increase in GDP per capita was associated with a 6% decrease in probability of DAMH receipt. An increase in trade equivalent to 1% of GDP was associated with 0.1% decrease in probability of DAMH receipt. A 1% increa se in share of DALYs for other health conditions was associated with a 1% decrease in probability of DAMH receipt, close to 10% statistical significance (p=0.106). The remaining variables were not associated with the probability of DAMH receipt.

Table 5.3 reports results from the main allocation model (i.e. the second part). Mental health -related DALYs per capita were not associated with DAMH per capita ceteris paribus . DAMH per capita was positively associated wi th four variables (past DAMH receipt, government health expenditure, conflicts and natural disasters) and negatively 130 with two others (DALYs for other health conditions, GDP per capita). Past DAMH recipients received 1.5 -fold greater DAMH per capita. An inc rease in government health expenditure of 1% of GDP was associated with 4 8% increase in DAMH per capita. Deaths from conflicts (one year prior) were more important in driving DAMH per capita than deaths from natural disasters (two years prior). A 1% increa se in share of DALYs for other health conditions was associated with a 24% decrease in DAMH per capita. A 1% increase in GDP per capita was associated with 12 4% decrease in DAMH per capita. The remaining variables were not associated with DAMH per capita.

Sensitivity analyses and robustnes s checks Statistically significant results remained essentially unchanged across models examined during sensitivity analyses for the selection model (see Table 5.2, models 2 to 6). Results for three independent variables (DALYs for mental health per capita , government effectiveness, and government health expenditure) appeared to be inconsistent in direction across models but none were statistically significant. DALYs for other health conditions were statistically significant when trade (model 6) was exclude d from the model specification. Results continued to be valid across models examined in sensitivity analyses for the allocation model (see Table 5.3, models 2 to 6). The only variable with less stable results across models was conflict -related deaths one year prior, which was not statistically 132 significant in three models (models 3 to 5). Three independent variables became statistically significant in some models. DALYs for mental health per capita were statistically significant when trade and government e ffectiveness were excluded from the model specification (model 5), with a 1% increase associated with a halving of DAMH per capita . Similarly, government effectiveness became statistically significant when trade and government health expenditure were exclu ded from the model specification (model 3), with a one -point increase in this indicator associated with a 94% increase in DAMH per capita . Disease outbreaks were statistically significant when trade and government health expenditure (model 3) or government effectiveness and government health expenditure (model 4) were excluded from the model specification. Across robustness checks, results were similar to the main specifications for both selection and allocation models, with some exceptions (see Supplemen t 5.8). When analyses were performed on the original dataset, conflicts two years prior became statistically significant in the selection model: the probability of receiving DAMH increased by 10% in countries experiencing conflict two years prior. In the a llocation model, deaths from conflict one year prior lost while deaths from disease outbreaks gained significance: an increase in deaths from disease outbreaks by 1000 individuals was associated with a 0.2% decrease in DAMH per capita. 5.4. Discussion Findings reveals that international donors' disbursements are not very well aligned with mental health needs of recipient countries, and, moreover, contextual factors might be playing more prominent roles in resource allocation. Countries were more likely to recei ve DAMH if they had experienced significant outbreaks of infectious diseases , and they had lower GDP per capita and market openness. Once selected as recipients, countries were more likely to receive higher DAMH amounts per capita if they had lower competi ng health needs and lower GDP per capita, higher government health expenditure, and bigger conflicts or natural disasters. Past DAMH recipients were more likely to be selected and, when selected, to receive higher DAMH amounts per capita. 133 Between 2000 and 2015, DAMH did not follow mental health needs of recipient countries. The misalignment between DAMH and mental health needs concurs with evidence of DAH allocation pertaining to other health conditions (Charlson et al., 2017; Dieleman et al., 2014; Shiffm an, 2006) . This misalignment could be attributed to the lack of understanding of mental disorders within the donor community, their definition and available solutions (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016) . It could also be ascribed to donor prioritisation of worst -off population groups (e.g. young people who are at high risk of experiencing mental disorders) not fully captured by total mental health needs, or different donor priorities (Voigt & King, 2017) . This could also reflect reticence to using DALYs for resource allocation due to lack of transparency in their estimation (Shiffman & Shawar, 2020) and equity concerns (Anand & Hanson, 1997) . However, the higher likelihood of receiving DAMH for countries experiencing significant outbreaks of infectious diseases suggests donors might understand and respond to increased mental health needs following humanitarian emergencies (Charlson et al., 20 19). This reflects humanitarian donors' growing attention to mental health during and after emergencies (WHO, 2013a) since the 2005 Tsunami in Banda Aceh and the subsequent publication of the Inter -Agency Standing Committee guidelines on mental health and psychosocial support in emergency settings (IASC, 2007) . The lack of positive association at the allocation stage suggests that response may not be adequate yet, and that resources might be disproportionally directed towards physical health. This concurs w ith the evidence on the disruption of non -outbreak -related health services during pandemics (Wilhelm & Helleringer, 2019) and a possible donor preference to fund mental health and psychosocial support integrated into sectors outside health as part of the h umanitarian response (Tol et al., 2011) . While positive associations were found for conflict and natural disaster at the allocation stage only, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the smaller sample size for the analyses that included those variables. Competing health needs had a negative impact on whether a country received any DAMH (close to 10% statistical significance) and on the size of that assistance among those countries who received any support. The negative impact corroborate s results from a rapid review (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016) identifying competing priorities as one of the reasons for underinvestment in mental disorders in LMICs. The same review highlights 134 the difficulties in measuring return on investment in mental health as a barrier to investment: resources may have been diverted to other health conditions with more cost - effective interventions (Bendavid et al., 2015) . This aligns with the literature on aid displacement demonstrating diversion of funding by donors' high priorities such as HIV/AIDS (Lordan et al., 2011) . This result could also be linked to the integration of mental health components into investments in other health conditions (e.g. HIV/AIDS, Chuah et al., 2017) and sectors beyond health (e.g. education, Fa zel et al., 2014) , not entirely captured by the IHME DAH dataset (IHME, 2018b) . Integration has been growing over the last decade along with the expanding evidence base on social determinants and impacts of mental health (Lund et al., 2018) . GDP per capi ta negatively impacted DAMH, meaning that countries with lower standards of living were more likely not only to be selected for assistance but also to receive higher amounts. This is in line with the broader literature on development assistance that sugges ts 'poverty selectivity' in resource allocation (Peiffer & Boussalis, 2015) . In addition, the alignment between DAMH and economic needs suggests that donors understand the vicious circle between poverty and mental disorders (i.e. people living with mental disorders are at higher risk of falling into poverty, and poor people are at higher risk of mental illness) (Lund et al., 2011) . Economic interests had a negative impact on the decision to provide assistance, but not on the amount of funding received. The lower impact of trade openness compared to GDP may be explained by the fact that, while trade openness is commonly used in the development aid literature, cross -country variation is determined more by GDP than by trade (E. Fujii, 2019) . Government health expenditure had a positive impact on the amount of DAMH (but not on whether any assistance was received), implying that selected countries that spend more government resources on health are being rewarded for their commitment. This is in line with the Mont errey Consensus (UN, 2003) , contending that development assistance is more effective when disbursed to countries with good policies and institutions, and with the literature on development assistance that suggests 'policy selectivity' in resource allocatio n (Peiffer & Boussalis, 2015) . Government effectiveness was not associated with DAMH, which contrasts with the evidence of 'institutional 135 selectivity' in the allocation of development assistance (Dollar & Levin, 2006) . However, sensitivity analyses suggest that the impact of government effectiveness may have been partly absorbed in the regression analyses by another variable (i.e. government health expenditure). Past receipts of DAMH had a positive impact on both the selection of DAMH recipients and the am ount of assistance received. This means that donors are more likely to disburse to countries with existing mental health programmes. While the biggest and most generous donor countries in the health field have not been found to influence other donors' beha viours (Beech et al., 2015) , quality signal mechanisms have been identified in philanthropic giving (Karlan & List, 2020) : the presence of mental health programmes could have encouraged disbursements by signalling not only mental health needs but also the feasibility of investment. Nevertheless this result also questions donors' path - dependency in prioritising specific recipient countries, and the risk of recipients' dependency on more volatile external funding and displacement of more sustainable domestic resources (Lu et al., 2010) . Data limitations meant that DAMH estimates did not include development assistance from other LMICs which are gaining importance in global health (Micah et al., 2019) and the representation of philanthropic donors was limited (see Chapter 4 ). Some DAMH figures may be underestimates because of the IHME methodological approach: for example disbursements from global health initiatives and some multilateral governmental organisations (United Nations Children's Fund, Joint United Na tions Programme on HIV and AIDS) are classified under health conditions constituting the organisation's focus, though their programmes may include mental health components (IHME, 2018b) . The majority of DAMH was excluded, as not allocated to single countri es. This limit s the generalisability of results to funding to specific countries, which may have been qualitatively different from funding to unspecified recipients . However, the IHME DAH dataset is currently the best source of data for this type of analyses (see Chapter 3 ). Second, the analyses did not include all the variables for all possible drivers of DAMH. For instance, a lack of panel data on government mental health expenditure meant that 136 government health expenditure was used as a proxy, and indicators for countries' mental health capacity (e.g. number of mental health workers) were not included. In addition , quantitative indicators d o not ca pture less quantifiable factors that have been shown to play a crucial role in shaping organisational decisions to invest in mental health in LMICs , such as support of leaders and champions within donor organisations, political support in both source and r ecipient countries, and advocacy efforts at the global level (see Chapter 6). Third, both DAMH and DALYs for mental health included some neurological disorders: these are identified as mental disorders by WHO (2008) because their service provision is often combined in LMICs. Fourth, I only examined the period between 2000 and 2015: this made it possible to use more robust DAMH data, and facilitated meaningful interpretation. Fifth, a few countries and territories had to be discarded because of a lack of da ta, including Palestine (an important recipient) (B. Gilbert et al., 2015) and some countries with conflicts and natural disasters. Finally, the disbursement processes are inherently complex (McCoy et al., 2009) and my models are necessarily simplification s. 5.5. Conclusion The analyses in this chapter suggest that better collective action amongst international donors is urgently required to address mental health needs in LMICs. Needs are on the rise due to epidemiological and demographic changes and an increas e in adverse social determinants of mental health (Patel et al., 2018) . Despite being the leading cause of years lived with disability in LMICs (18%), mental disorders attract as little as 1.6% of LMIC government health budgets (WHO, 2018b) and 0.4% of DAH (Charlson et al., 2017) . The impact of COVID -19 and the following policy responses are likely to amplify those needs (Brooks et al., 2020) and put additional pressure on LMIC government finances. In line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (UN, 2015a) , the Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015b) recommend harnessing resources from a wide range of sources including development assistance, while gradually increasing domestic financing to ensure sustainability. They also emphasize the importance of collectiv e efforts across countries to achieve sustainable development. 137 Global collective action to finance non -communicable disorders is limited. WHO Independent High -Level Commission on non -communicable diseases has proposed a multi -donor fund for non -communica ble disorders and mental health (Nishtar et al., 2018) , yet the establishment of a new organisation in an already large ecosystem of actors could contribute to additional fragmentation of efforts. Similarly, experts have posited the creation of a partnersh ip for global mental health to mobilise funding and provide stewardship for their effective use (Vigo et al., 2019) . While further research on global collective action in mental health financing is required, particularly on its challenges such as free -riding and social norms (Siegal et al., 2009) and on social networks (Han et al., 2018) , this paper points to opportunities to improve the collective response of international donors to address mental health in LMICs. The mental health needs of recipient coun tries need to be better reflected in DAMH allocation. While ranking recipient countries to inform DAH allocation requires a careful choice of multiple indicators (Ottersen et al., 2018) , health needs have come to the foreground in more recent discussions (Haakenstad et al., 2018) especially vis -\u00e0-vis low - income countries (Ottersen et al., 2017) . Recipient countries have been shown to value burden of disease more than income per capita (Grepin et al., 2018) , the predominance of which in allocation decisions has been already challenged (Sterck et al., 2018) . To ensure local ownership and sustainability of programmes beyond funded activities (Kiendrebeogo & Meessen, 2019) , donors should position recipient coun tries at the centre of funding decisions: systematically including countries' preferences and priorities (Grepin et al., 2018) at the allocation stage and adopting a long -term approach (K. Gilbert et al., 2019) . In particular, DAMH allocation should better target humanitarian emergencies, where mental health needs increase (Charlson et al., 2019) . Resources should target response during both the emergency (IASC, 2007) and the recovery period, providing opportunities to build better mental health systems (WH O, 2013a) . This approach is pertinent to the current COVID -19 response and the future recovery phase. International donors could strengthen their response s to mental health needs in LMICs by integrating mental health components into investments in other p riorities, in particular different health conditions and sectors beyond health. Mental disorders often co -occur 138 with communicable (Remien et al., 2019) and other non-communicable disorders (Mendenhall et al., 2017) , playing a key role in both treatment and recovery. With a substantial population of people living with communicable disorders (GBD 2017 HIV Collaborators, 2019) and an increasing burden of non -communicable disorders worldwide (GBD 2017 DALYs and nted challenge: a synergetic approach to DAMH could improve health systems response. Similarly, mental disorders affect and are affected by multiple dimensions of people's lives (Patel et al., 2018) and the social determinants of mental disorders go beyond the health sector (Lund et al., 2018) , thus calling for wide -ranging investments. In particular, the well -established link between poverty and mental disorders offers opportunities for catalysing the impact of development programmes through inclusion of b oth aspects (Lund et al., 2011) . 139 Supplementary material Supplement 5.1: Factor selection: in -depth interviews I selected factors and data source through a review of the literature on factors associated with development assistance for mental health and health, complemented by 35 in -depth interviews with key informants working in international organisations that are prominent players in global health and experts in global mental health who provided meaning and context. Participants were sampled using purposeful sampling and snowballing. To account for heterogeneity of the population, they were stratified by their org anisation group (see Chapter 3 ). In-depth semi -structured interviews were conducted face -to-face or via telephone/Skype between February and December 2018. Informed consent was obtained from participants in writing or orally ahead of the interview. Interviews focused on the role of exte rnal actors investing in mental health in low - and middle -income countries and comprehended a set of questions on factors in recipient countries driving allocation of resources, including development assistance for mental health. Interviews were digitally recorded (when permitted) and notes taken. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and relevant factors identified. Ethical approval was obtained from the London School of Economics and Political Science Research Ethics Committee (Ref. 000589).

US$=United States dollars. 143 Seventeen regressors were used in the imputation model: yit =0+ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + + 6( ) + 7 + 8 (% ) + 9 + 10 (% ) + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 30+ 17 + where y represents the four imputed variables; i recipient country; t year; intercept; regression coefficients for each independent variable; u error term. The imputation model includes all variables from the final analytical model, two variables reflecting time series cross -sectional data structure (year, recipient country), and four auxiliary variables highly correlated with imputed variables ( World Bank income group, population, proportion of the population under 30, government health spending). World Bank income groups came from the World Bank country classification using the World Bank Atlas Method (World Bank, 2018) . The variable representin g the proportion of the population under 30 years old was sourced from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 Population Estimates 1950 -2017 dataset published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Netwo rk, 2018c) . Logarithmic values of three variables were used to normalise their distribution (Population) or to facilitate interpretation (DALYs for mental health per capita, GDP per capita). No additional variables predicting missingness were added. Logari thmic values were used during the imputation process. Missing data were treated using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) with predictive mean matching, 20 imputations and kernel 1 (White et al., 2011) . The number of imputations (20) was chos en to reflect the percentage of missing data (16%), in line with the rule of thumb proposed by White et al. (2011) , which builds on Bodner (2008) . The number of closest observations (nearest neighbours) to draw from was reduced to 1 144 in order to increase th e probability of using during the imputation process values resulting in valid statistical inference. Post imputation diagnostics were performed on both imputation and analytical models (Nguyen et al., 2017) . One auxiliary variable (World Bank income grou p) had missed data (1.1%). For this variable only, missing data were imputed using the 'first observation carried backward' before performing multiple imputation. This method was chosen as data were not missing at random but reflected disbursements to reci pient countries created during the period of study (i.e. Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan). Extreme changes in income group country classification were unlikely due to the relatively short time period (i.e. 16 years). 145 Supplement 5.4: Model specification I used the following base specification of the two -part model: Selection equation: Pr( =1)it =F ( 0+ 1 2 + 1 2 + 2 2 + 3( 2 2) +4 2 + 5 (% )2 + 6 2 + 7 (% )2 +8 1 +9 2+ 10 1 + 11 2 + 12 1 + 13 ) Allocation equation: Ln of DAMH per capita it =0 + 1 2 + 2 2 + 3( 2 2) +4 2 + 5 (% )2 + 6 2 + 7 (% )2 +8 ( )1+9 ( )2 + + 12 ( )1+ 13 2+14 + where i is the recipient country; t year; s lags; F cumulative distribution function; 0 and 0 intercepts; regression coefficient for the autoregressive term; and regression coefficients for each independent variable; u error term. 146 Supplement 5.5: Estimation approach I used a two -part model (Cragg, 1971) to reflect the two stages of the resource allocation process (Stubbs et al., 2016) . This model has the ad vantage of relaxing assumptions in single -step estimation techniques (e.g. Tobit) that the drivers of any DAMH receipt are the same as the drivers of the amount of such assistance (Clist, 2011) . However, a potential problem with two -part models is the assu mption that error terms are uncorrelated between the two parts, implying that the two decisions are taken independently. While Heckman's two -step estimator allows for error terms to be correlated (Heckman, 1979) , it works better with an exclusionary variab le which determines the first but not the second stage. Without this exclusionary variable, which is the case here, estimates depend on stricter distributional assumptions and are more sensitive to non -normality and heteroskedasticity (Harrigan & Wang, 201 1). Previous studies find little correlation between error terms in both equations, suggesting the two decisions are made independently (Hoeffler & Outram, 2011) . In accordance with Stubbs et al. (2016) , I did not use the system Generalized Method of Mome nts (GMM) estimator. For the selection model, the presence of a limited dependent variable did not allow for the use of the system GMM estimator. For the allocation model, while GMM techniques for panel data are increasingly used to study allocation of dev elopment assistance, caution is called when used with panel datasets with different characteristics from the one they were originally designed for (i.e. few time periods and thousands of panels) (Wilson, 2011) . This is due to loss of precision in standard errors and unreliable inferences in the presence of instrument proliferation (Roodman, 2009) . Informed by Neumayer (2003) , I used pooled estimators instead of fixed effects models because the focus of this study was on factors associated with DAMH disburs ement between countries (not within countries) and there was little within -country variation. Gravity models were not used in order to include all DAMH independently from the source. Analyses would have required three different two -part models to explore t hree different sources (bilateral governmental organisations, multilateral governmental 147 organisations, and foundations) while the focus of this study was on collective action across donors. Random effects models were not used due to misspecification revea led by the Hausman specification test, meaning that recipient country effects were not adequately modelled in random effects models when compared with fixed effects models (Hausman, 1978) . The clustered standard errors estimator was used to correct for ser ial correlation within recipient countries. Adjusted standard errors using the cluster sandwich estimator allow relaxation of the assumption that observations are independent, i.e. allow for possible correlation of observations within recipient country. A potential concern was endogeneity leading to under - or over -estimation of true associations. I addressed endogeneity due to omitted variables, simultaneity, and measurement errors. I used pre -estimation diagnostics (link test) to test for model misspecifi cations and possible variable omissions, and post -estimation diagnostics to test the validity of models both visually (residual plots) and numerically (Wald test). Lagging independent variables mitigated potential concerns of simultaneity with dependent variables. Major systematic measurement errors in the variables were not found in the literature. 148 Supplement 5.6: Country included in the analyses, by WHO region (N=142) AFR (N=45) Algeria Angola Benin Botswana\u00a7 Burkina Faso Burundi Cameroon Cape Verde\u00a7 Central African Republic Chad Comoros\u00a7 Congo (Brazzaville) Cote d'Ivoire Equatorial Guinea\u00a7 Eritrea Ethiopia Madagascar Senegal Seychelles\u00a7 Sierra Leone South Africa South Sudan Swaziland Tanzania The Gambia Togo Uganda Zambia Zimbabwe AMR (N=29) Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Barbados\u00a7 Belize Bolivia Brazil Chile Colombia Costa Rica Dominica\u00a7 Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador Grenada Guatemala Guyana Haiti Honduras Jamaica Mexico Nicaragua Panama Paraguay Peru Saint Lucia Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Suriname Uruguay Venezuela EMR (N=15) Afghanistan Bahrain* \u00a7 Djibouti\u00a7 Egypt Iran Iraq Jordan Lebanon Libya Morocco Oman\u00a7 Pakistan Saudi Arabia\u00a7 Sudan Tunisia EUR (N=27) Albania Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Bosnia and Herzegovina Bulgaria\u00a7 Croatia Czech Republic\u00a7 Estonia\u00a7 Georgia Hungary Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Latvia\u00a7 Lithuania\u00a7 Macedonia Moldova Montenegro Poland Russia Serbia Slovakia Tajikistan Turkey Turkmenistan\u00a7 Ukraine Uzbekistan SEAR (N=9) Bangladesh Bhutan India Indonesia Maldives\u00a7 Myanmar Nepal Sri Lanka Thailand WPR (N=17) Cambodia China Federated States of Micronesia\u00a7 Fiji Kiribati Laos Malaysia Marshall Islands\u00a7 Mongolia Papua New Guinea\u00a7 Philippines Samoa\u00a7 Solomon Is lands South Korea* \u00a7 Tonga\u00a7 Vanuatu\u00a7 Vietnam Twenty -six countries and territories were discarded due to lack of data on variables of interest: Anguilla, Cook Islands, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kosovo, Mayotte, Montserrat, Nauru, Niue, North Korea, Palau, Palestine, Romania, Saint Helena , Saint Martin, Sao Tome and Principe, Somalia, St Kitts and Nevis, Syria, Timor Leste, 149 Tokelau, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna Islands, Yemen. *Countries excluded from analyses of selection model. \u00a7Countries exclu ded from analyses of allocation model.

External resources are urgently needed but evidence on investments is limited. This study uses 35 elite interviews and documentary analyses to examine how and why external organisations have invested in mental health in LMICs over the past three decades and how this has changed over time. Four levels are examined: organisations, source countries, recipient countries, global landscape. Organisations invested in numerous internal and external activities. Amongst the various factors shaping organisational decisions, actors were the most salient at all four levels. To increase external organisation investments in mental health in LMICs, organisational leadership and understanding are critical, along with increased political support in source and recipient countries, and a stronger governance structu re at the global level. 6.1. Introduction Around the world 1.2 billion people live with mental disorders (including substance use disorders, dementia and self -harm), 81% of whom live in LMICs (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018d) . Although me ntal disorders are the leading cause of disability in LMICs (IHME, 2018c) and account for high economic costs (Bloom et al., 2011) , they attract little funding: an average of 1.6% of government health budgets across LMICs (WHO, 2013b) and 0.4% of developme nt assistance for health (Charlson et al., 2017) . The Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development 8 A version of this chapter is currently in press with Lancet Psychiatry with the following referen ce: Iemmi, V. (In press). How and why external organisations invest in mental health in low - and middle -income countries: a qualitative analysis . Lancet Psychiatry . 166 recently called for more domestic and external resources for mental health to address this shortfall (Patel et al., 2018) . Having been long neglected globally (Tomlinson & Lund, 2012) , mental health is now gaining prominence in the global discourse (Kleinman et al., 2016) , albeit without concomitant funding. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda (UN, 2015a) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015b) recommend mobilisation of external resources from various sources (e.g. development assistance, foreign direct investments), along with a gradual increase of domestic resources to ensure sustainability. External resour ces are especially key in LMICs where governments face considerable economic pressures. It is therefore critical to understand how external organisations invest in mental health in LMICs and what influences their decision -making. A large and complex ecosy stem of external organisations for mental health in LMICs exists across the public, private, and third sectors, yet their contributions are limited (see Chapter 3 ). For instance, while development assistance for mental health has increased six-fold over tw o decades, it still accounts for the lowest amount of development assistance for health per disability -adjusted life year (i.e. year of 'healthy' life loss) across health conditions (Charlson et al., 2017) . Philanthropy plays a crucial role, representing one third of development assistance for mental health compared to one sixth of development assistance for health (see Chapter 4 ). Diverse arguments have been advanced to increase investments in mental health in LMICs, from public health to economic welfare, economic growth and productivity, equity, sociocultural influence, and political influence (WHO, 2013b) . However, commitments ha ve been hampered by poor understanding of mental disorders, lack of strong metrics, stigma, and competing priorities (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016; Saraceno et al., 2007) . To the author's knowledge, no study has yet explored prioritisation of mental health in LMICs by external organisations. A broad literature explores the generation of priorities in health at global levels (Shiffman, 2010) and resource allocation formulae (Ottersen et al., 2018) , but little attention is given to factors affecting prioritisatio n within external organisations (Berth\u00e9lemy, 2006) . 167 This paper examines how and why external organisations have invested in mental health in LMICs over the past three decades, and identifies challenges and opportunities to inform discussion on sustainable financing for mental health in LMICs. 6.2. Methods 6.2.1. Data collection The author conducted 35 elite interviews (February -December 2018) lasting on average 1h (0\u00b75 -1\u00b75h), with decision -makers working in international organisations in global health and experts in global mental health, selected for their strategic position and influence (Harvey, 2011) . Participants were selected using purposeful sampling and snowballing until saturation (i.e. point at which additional interviews were unlikely to reveal new informati on) (Robson, 2011) . Purposeful sampling was informed by a systematic review of external organisations active in mental health in LMICs (see Chapter 3) and by documentary searches in websites of key international organisations working in global health and d evelopment. To capture the heterogeneity of the population, participants were sampled for diversity according to their organisation group (see Chapter 3 ): public sector (bilateral and multilateral governmental organisations, bilateral and multilateral de velopment finance institutions), private sector (corporations and small and medium enterprises, foundations), third sector (nongovernmental organisations) and multisector partnerships (global health initiatives, innovation funds) (see Box 6.1). Twenty -eigh t organisations from 12 countries in three regions (Africa, Americas, Europe) were represented. See Supplement 6.2 for participant characteristics. The author conducted in -depth semi -structured interviews face -to-face and via telephone or Skype, in English and Italian. The interview guide was individually adapted to elicit knowledge of each participant (see Supplement 6.3). Informed consent was obtain ed from participants in writing or orally before interview. Interviews were digitally recorded when permitted (N=29) and notes taken. Recordings were transcribed verbatim , along with interview and field notes . To triangulate information across different so urces and 168 minimise bias during data analysis (Padgett, 2012) , the author supplemented interviews with documentary analyses of peer -reviewed and grey literature, and institutional websites of included organisations (e.g. scientific papers, charters, strategic plans, policy and financial reports, public statements). 6.2.2. Data analysis Thematic analysis was used, organising data into two themes (activities and motivations) and allowing for emergence of new categories (Braun & Clarke, 2006) . The first theme explored funded activities through three sub -themes: typology, arguments, strategies. The second theme explored endogenous and exogenous factors shaping organisations' decisions through four sub -themes: organisations, so urce countries where organisations were legally registered (not applicable for multilateral actors), recipient countries, global landscape. To facilitate interpretation within each sub -theme, the author grouped results in the four main categories proposed by Shiffman and Smith (Shiffman & Smith, 2007) : actors, ideas shaping the issue understanding and portrayal, contexts in which actors operate, and issue characteristics (credible indicators, severity, interventions). Full analytical framework in Supplement 6.4. The unit of analysis was the organisation. To maximise the robustness of data and minimise bias, the author triangulated across data sources. Analyses were conducted in NVivo 12 (QSR International Pty Ltd, 2018) . To ensure confidentiality, interview quotations were anonymised. See Supplement 6.5 for illustrative quotations. The author followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) (see Supplement 6.1) (O'Brien et al., 2014) . Ethical approval was obtained from the London School of Economics and Political Science Research Ethics Committee (Ref. 000589). Box 6. 1: External organisations (see Chapter 3 ) Public sector Includes governmental organisations (GOs) providing goods and services to LMICs in agreement with recipient country governments, and development finance institutions (DFIs) offering financial products (e.g. loans) in contexts perceived too risky for 169 commercial banks. Bilateral GOs are funded by a single state through aid agencies and other governmental agencies investing in development (e.g. US Agency for International Development, ministries of foreign affairs or their equivalents), while multilateral GOs are funded by diverse states at the regional, international, and global level (e.g. European Commission, World Health Organization). Similarly, bilateral DFIs are funded by a single state offering financial products usually at commercial rates (e.g. US Overseas Private Investment Corporation), while multilateral DFIs offer financial prod ucts usually at facilitated rates and are funded by diverse states at regional, international, and global level (e.g. African Development Bank, World Bank). Private sector Encompasses corporations and small and medium enterprises (CSME), and foundations. CSME are for -profit organisations providing goods and services to/in LMICs through foreign investments (e.g. foreign direct investments) and corporate social responsibility (e.g. financial and in -kind contributions). Foundations are non -profit organisations often grant -making and mostly funded either by for -profit companies (e.g. Microsoft Philanthropies) or gift of shares and endowments from wealthy individuals and their families (e.g. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation). Third sector Comprises the most heterogenous group of non -profit organisations providing goods and services in LMICs, spanning nongovernmental organisations (e.g. BasicNeeds), professional associations (e.g. World Psychiatric Association) and research centres. Multisector partn erships Similarly diverse, this group includes multi -stakeholder partnerships initiated by organisations from two or more sectors to increase visibility and resources for global health issues, such as global health initiatives (e.g. Global Fund to Fight AI DS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) and innovation funds (e.g. Dementia Discovery Fund). 170 6.3. Results Over the past three decades, external organisations have invested in mental health in LMICs through a broad range of internal and external activities (see Table 6. 1). Some organisations have invested in the mental health of their employees through improvement of mental health standards in the workplace, especially amongst corporations. Other organisations have strengthened their mental health capacity, especially in the public and third sectors, through the establishment of mental health advisors, communities of practice, training, guidelines, and monitoring and evaluation of funded mental health activities. Finally, some organisations have supported external activit ies, including mental health requirements into funded projects, stand -alone programmes, integration into existing priorities, new priority areas, and using their convening power to advance the global mental health agenda. The following sections identify fa ctors that shaped organisational decisions to commit to mental health in LMICs (for illustrative quotations see Supplement 6.5). 171 Action Description Within organisations Organisations' mental health Wellbeing activities Wellbeing programmes and activities for all employees aiming to promote mentally healthy environments (interview 5). Mental health awareness training Mental health awareness training aiming to strengthen mental health literacy. For instance, Mental Health First Aid courses to provide employees with knowledge and skills needed to recognise mental health symptoms and support colleagues in recovery (interview 5). Mental health peer support groups Peer support groups for individuals living with or caring for people with mental disorders aiming to create a support network and an advocacy entity within the organisation (interview 21). Easier to introduce in organisations having already established other employee groups (e.g. for minorit ies or women). Mental health support Support programmes for employees living with mental disorders aiming to improve their work experience and recovery (interview 21). Organisations' mental health capacity Mental health advisor Creation of the new rol e of mental health advisor aiming to establish a focal person with the purpose to advise on, coordinate and amplify the organisation activities in mental health (interview 21, 29). In larger organisations, this role may be assisted by regional and sometime s country advisors (interview 19). Mental health community of practice Network of employees working in or interested in mental health, aiming to share useful resources and lessons learnt through funded activities, and to offer employees a reference group to turn to for concerted advice (interview 34). Mental health training Mental health training across different departments with two purposes. On the one side, initial learning journeys not only to strengthen mental health capacity but also to identify possible entry points for the organisation (interview 31). On the other side, more regular mental health training, especially recommended in organisations with high staff turn -over. Mental health guidelines Production of guidelines describing the organi sation specific approach to mental health aiming to harmonise contributions across the organisation (interview 30, 34). Mental health activities monitoring and evaluation Monitoring of mental health activities funded outside the organisation to ensure transparency and accountability (interview 20). Evaluation to inform future investments and to strengthen mental health capacity through knowledge building and sharing, especially when included in mental health guidelines. Outside organisations Requirement for all projects Mental health considerations across all projects, with broad variation in scope: from recommending integration of mental health components to recipients (though with difficult uptake) (interview 4), to ensuring all recipients mee t relevant development requirements (e.g. non -discriminatory practices 172 Table 6. 1: Organisation activities. toward people with mental disorders) (interview 27), and requiring the inclusion of mental health components within funded activities (interview 20). Stand -alone programme Stand -alone mental health programme or initiative, often with a health focus (interview 32) (see Box 6.3). Integration in existing programmes Integration of mental health into organisations' existing priority areas, and across different health conditions, sectors a nd themes (interview 31) (see Box 6.3). Priority area Mental health as a priority area. Convening power Use of the organisation's convening power to advance the global mental health agenda and increase contributions (interview 18, 22, 34). 173 6.3.1. Organisations Individuals within organisations were pivotal in prioritising mental health in LMICs. First and foremost, leaders were central in shaping priorities from the top down (interview 22, 28) linked to personal expertise and interests, and a desire for personal legacy (interview 32). Along with leaders, champions within the organisation were instrumental in pushing the agenda from the bottom up (interview 5, 23) using diverse arguments to make the case for investments (see Box 6.2), yet their actions were insuffi cient, and other factors often acted as catalysts (e.g. natural disasters, interview 19). Improved understanding and destigmatisation of mental health within an organisation favoured investments. In the past, poor understanding led to missed opportunitie s (e.g. exclusion of mental disorders from non -communicable disease packages) (interview 8) or misplaced contributions (e.g. to institutions instead of community -based services for people living with mental disorders) (interview 1). Over the past decade, b etter cognisance of mental health as a health issue with multiple impacts across sectors and dimensions of life revealed entry points across organisations (interview 5, 21) (see Box 6.3). In addition, the global scale of the issue meant that it resonated a mongst most employees as individuals with lived experience or carers (interview 4, 5). Organisation contexts shaped commitments in five ways. First, the relevance of mental health for organisations' strategic roles and priorities influenced the type of in vestments more than its prioritisation (interview 19, 21, 28). In particular, the large number of existing priorities and unfinished work in established areas meant that organisations were less likely to take on new challenges, unless integrated into exist ing programmes and activities (interview 13) (see Box 6.3). Second, financial capacity and the principle of impact -maximisation affected decisions. Organisations often prioritised mental health as a neglected area where (often small) contributions could ha ve a bigger social or financial return on investment (interview 1, 5, 12, 14, 19). Third, in the past, a lack of internal capacity hindered commitments (interview 5, 18), often exacerbated by lack of coordination and high staff turnover (interview 29). How ever, the establishment of activities to strengthen mental health internal capacity (e.g. mental health advisors, 174 communities of practice) (see Table 6.1) facilitated uptake over the past decade (interview 21, 29). Fourth, an increased interest among ind ividuals and entities to whom organisations were accountable (e.g. citizens, member states, shareholders) benefited favourable decisions (interview 11, 18, 32). Often a reflection of accountability, risk -aversion and bureaucracy influenced the rapidity of change: less bureaucratic and risk -averse organisations (e.g. nongovernmental organisations, foundations) were quicker to commit than more bureaucratic and risk -averse ones (e.g. bilateral and multilateral governmental organisations) (interview 9, 16, 18). Finally, organisation commitments were guided by vested interests, such as economic, social, political, reputational or personal gain. While more obvious in the case of commercial arms of corporations and third sector organisations, vested interests were less apparent in other organisations or organisation arms (e.g. corporate social responsibility initiatives) where different types of interests may have coexisted. For instance, in the past, some foundations attached to for -profit companies invested in men tal health in LMICs to create new markets (interview 32). The characteristics of mental health as an issue hampered organisation investments for three reasons. The lack of clear and strong outcome indicators compared to other health conditions was a barri er, especially in organisations strongly driven by social or financial return on investments (e.g. corporations, innovation funds) (interview 11, 16, 17). While the burden of mental disorders in LMICs was substantial and has grown over the past two decades , low availability and poor quality of epidemiological and financial data meant that arguments for contributions were difficult to make (interview 22). Finally, the scarcity of simple cost -effective solutions in mental health and the paucity of evidence on their scalability was a major obstacle, especially in for -profit organisations (e.g. corporations) (interview 3, 12, 14, 16, 21). 175 Box 6 2: Arguments Over the past three decades, six different arguments have been used by organisations to make the case for investment in mental health, often simultaneously, and organisations have responded to different arguments aligned with their values and priorities (interview 4, 26). Public Health Focuses on the scale of the problem and availability of solutions (Patel et al., 2018) . The size of the problem is described in terms of number of persons affected (e.g. prevalence), disability attached to the condition (e.g. disability -adjusted life years) (interview 7, 21) and unmet needs (e. g. treatment gap, which is the gap between need for and provision of services). Available effective solutions are recommended to address needs. This argument has been widely used across all organisations. Public health framing has been unsuccessful in the past when benefits of interventions were advanced without adequate evidence (interview 26). Human Rights Focuses on human right abuses (e.g. chaining, torture, sterilisation) (UNHRC, 2019) and inequities (e.g. lack of parity between physical and mental he alth care). Often deploys illustrative before -and-after stories highlighting the effectiveness of available solutions to seize people's imaginations (interview 10) and to create an emotional connection (interview 7). This argument has been most successful among rights -based organisations and where personal relationships play more prominent roles (e.g. small foundations) (interview 10). Economic Highlights productivity losses and societal costs of mental disorders, with economic impacts at individual (e.g. income loss) and societal levels (e.g. gross domestic product loss),3 and the potential return on investment in interventions (Chisholm et al., 2016) . It has gained prominence across organisations over the past decade due to growing availability of economi c data, yet often is an insufficient argument in its own (interview 176 4). This argument has been especially relevant in for -profit organisations (e.g. corporations). Country priorities Emphasises requests for support from source and recipient countries. Wh ile the former highlight the importance of donor -driven priorities, the latter align with the principles of ownership (i.e. recipient -driven priorities) and sustainability of impact beyond funded activities. This argument has been used especially within pu blic sector organisations (interview 4). Moral Frames contributions to global mental health as the 'right thing to do' (Patel et al., 2006b) . Less often used, this argument has been justified as aligned with organisational values (interview 5). For instance, in some organisations, ethical considerations led to the integration of mental health components within funded activities (interview 20). Happiness Portrays mental health as the major cause of unhappiness (Layard et al., 2013) . It transcends the public health argument (interview 15). This argument has emerged more recently, concomitantly with the happiness and wellbeing agenda globally. Box 6. 3: Strategies Stand -alone Pushes mental health as a stand -alone issue, often limited to the health sector (interview 32). Traditionally, it has been the prominent strategy. However, organisations have realised that mental health is 'a different challenge' that cannot be addressed with the same strategies used for other health conditions (interview 13). 177 Integrated Pulls together mental health programmes and activities within organisations' existing priorities: different health conditio ns (e.g. HIV/AIDS) (Remien et al., 2019) , sectors (e.g. education, employment, criminal justice) (Patel et al., 2016a) , and themes (e.g. gender, disability, youth) (Lund et al., 2018) (interview 6, 12, 15). It is beneficial not only for addressing mental d isorders but also for amplifying the impact of investments in existing priority areas (interview 29). Stronger evidence and better articulation of those links have facilitated the identification of entry points within organisations' existing priorities (interview 15). This strategy is now gaining prominence and success. The emergence of an integrated strategy has benefitted from traction gained by the multisectoral and life -course approaches in mental health. The multisectoral approach advocates for a whol e-society response, coordinated across sectors and areas of life (interview 28, 34). The life-course approach frames the impact of investments over the lifetime from childhood to adulthood and across generations (e.g. from individuals to their children and vice versa) (interview 6). This approach has benefitted from an increased focus on non -communicable disorders already adopting it, and the inclusion of mental health within non -communicable disorders (interview 28). Those approaches have been gaining traction especially among organisations in the public sector, possibly due to more sizeable investments and opportunities to adopt a systemic approach, often in partnership with LMIC governments. 6.3.2. Source countries Political leaders' commitment to mental health in the source country directly or indirectly influenced organisation contributions to mental health in LMICs, especially in public sector organisations. Neglected for many years, the recent ascent of mental health on domestic ag endas is slowly percolating into development and foreign policy agendas (interview 8, 13, 19). This reflects a growing public appetite for the issue (interview 5), facilitated by its destigmatisation and more positive coverage in the media (interview 26). In addition, the tax systems in source countries shaped commitment size and characteristics, through tax incentives (interview 10) and disbursement requirements 178 (e.g. through channel organisations in the source country) (interview 9) for private and third sector organisations. 6.3.3. Recipient countries While mental health needs in recipient countries motivated organisation commitments to mental health in LMICs (interview 28, 34), political support facilitated them (interview 7, 26) and its absence posed a major obstacle (interview 1, 11), especially in the public sector. Political willingness of recipient countries meant governments were more open to both requesting and receiving external funding (interview 19, 28, 32, 34) and to ensuring sustainability of impact beyond funded activities (interview 19). Often linked to pervading stigma, lack of public support in recipient countries equally hindered commitments (interview 4). The 'readiness' of recipient countries influenced investments (interview 4), especially in the private sector. In particular, while a lack of absorptive capacity (e.g. low numbers of mental health workers) constituted a major barrier across sectors, lack of fiscal (e.g. government mental health budget) and regulatory (e.g. mental health acts an d policies) spaces deterred the creation of markets, discouraging especially for -profit organisations (e.g. corporations) (interview 32). 6.3.4. Global landscape While the lack of a momentum was historically a barrier for investments (interview 8), over the pas t decade global mental health moved from exceptionalism to an emerging 'new market' (interview 10, 35), gaining prominence in the development discourse (interview 5) amongst external actors in health and beyond (interview 8, 19). However, organisation rela tionships were fraught with historical tensions, especially vis -\u00e0-vis pharmaceutical companies (interview 1) and the larger for -profit sector (interview 17). A 'permanent system of influence' (interview 10), a group of charismatic individuals, was crucial in propelling mental health higher in the agenda and fuelling excitement across organisations (interview 10, 16, 18), yet its strong research focus is starting to show its limitations in influencing non -research organisations (interview 11, 19). Insufficie nt in the past, the growing advocacy movement of strong grassroot organisations led to increased visibility of mental health and provided the external pressure which was instrumental in spurring organisation investments (interview 19, 21, 28). 179 The fragme ntation of the mental health community led to the coexistence of a multiplicity of different understandings and portrayals of the issue, which increased confusion and hampered organisation investments (interview 5, 16, 32). The Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development (Patel et al., 2018) recently provided a clearer description of the issue to the mental health community, combining different approaches and attempting to unite the field, although it is not without critics (Cosgro ve et al., 2019) . Conversely, while stigma was a barrier in the past, the recent destigmatisation of mental health and deinstitutionalisation contributed to illuminate the size of the burden and available solutions, facilitating investments (interview 1, 2 6). Some events created policy windows that galvanised action (e.g. 2004 tsunamis in Banda Ache and Sri Lanka) (interview 19, 22), while others were considered as missed opportunities (e.g. 2014 -2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa) (interview 25). Most of them constituted 'stepping stones', gradually influencing investments (interview 19, 26). For instance, the inclusion of mental health in the SDGs (UN, 2015b) , in global conventions (e.g. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) (UN, 2006) and plans (e.g. Mental Health Action Plan 2013 -2020) (WHO, 2013c) helped elevate the issue in the development discourse (interview 29) and provided frameworks for action (interview 12, 14) but was rarely followed by financial commitments (interview 3, 11, 1 9). Similarly, high -level meetings focusing on mental health were instrumental in energising the mental health community and increasing political attention (interview 4, 10, 16, 17), yet 'successful' in influencing commitments only when some actors were al ready willing to invest (e.g. G8 Dementia Summit convened by UK Prime Minister David Cameron in 2013) (DHSC, 2013) (interview 21). Less formal roundtables and meetings organised by non-state actors played important roles in stoking leaders' interest and pr ompting commitments from key external actors, highlighting the importance of informal networks and relationships (interview 4, 5, 6, 10, 25). Finally, while the absence of a global governance structure may have hampered investments, the creation of coordi nation groups helped to spur interests amongst and 180 collaborations across organisations. These included the Inter -Agency Standing Committee reference group on mental health and psychosocial support in emergency settings established in 2007 (interview 24), t he International Alliance for Mental Health Research Funders in 2010, and the first permanent donor group on psychosocial support in humanitarian settings in 2018 (interview 18). 6.4. Discussion Over the past three decades, external organisations invested in mental health in LMICs through a panoply of internal and external activities, including activities strengthening employees' mental health, organisations' capacity, and investments. Among the numerous factors that shaped their decisions, actors were the mos t salient ones across all levels: from leaders and champions within organisations, to political leaders supporting the issue in both source and recipient countries, and a group of charismatic individuals and grassroot organisations advocating at the global level. 6.4.1. Challenges and opportunities Several challenges to external organisation investments in mental health in LMICs can be identified across the four levels of analysis (see Table 6.2). The main barriers for organisations were lack of individual suppo rt especially at the leadership level, poor understanding of the issue (worsened by stigma), and unfavourable contexts, such as lack of relevance for the organisation's strategic role and priorities, competing priorities, and lack of internal capacity. Thi s confirms previous studies (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016; Saraceno et al., 2007) identifying poor understanding of mental health, stigma and competing priorities as barriers to investments in mental health in LMICs. The prominent role of committed individuals spurring change within organisations aligns with the large literature on norm entrepreneurs in global health (Kamradt -Scott, 2010) . Additional barriers were posed by the characteristics of mental health as an issue: lack of clear outcome indicators, low availability and poor quality of data, and lack of simple cost-effective interventions. While poor metrics hampering investments in mental health in LMICs aligns with previous studies (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016; Saraceno et al., 2007) , this finding calls f or caution. Having addressed similar measurement issues, the 181 experience of the Safe Motherhood Initiative sheds light on potential problems mental health metrics could face, including distorting priorities (Storeng & B\u00e9hague, 2017) and narrowing the policy agenda (Storeng & B\u00e9hague, 2014) . With respect to source and recipient countries, the main obstacles were lack of political and public support and unfavourable contexts, such as low tax incentives in source countries and lack of absorptive capacity and fiscal and regulatory spaces in recip ient countries. Political will is a major barrier for scaling -up mental health services in LMICs (Saraceno et al., 2007) , though new political interest is emerging (Chisholm et al., 2019) . Common concerns of absorptive capacity in global health question th e effectiveness of and diminishing return on investments in LMICs, yet low -income countries and less developed health systems are more likely to use received contributions, especially those with political stability (Lu et al., 2006) . Globally, the main de terrents were lack of grassroot organisations, tensions across organisations especially vis -\u00e0-vis for -profit, and unfavourable contexts, such as missed policy windows and lack of a global governance structure. Those results confirm previous findings (Tomli nson & Lund, 2012) . The generation of political attention for global health issues, such as maternal mortality and newborn survival have been hampered by similar issues of incohesive community, unexploited windows of opportunities, and fragmented global go vernance (Shiffman, 2010; Shiffman & Smith, 2007) . Tensions with for -profit organisations and conflicts of interest have increased in global health due to its financialization (Krech et al., 2018) and the rise of philanthropy (Stuckler et al., 2011) . Howe ver, opportunities are emerging (see Table 6.2). New, strong leaders and champions within organisations and better understanding of mental health along with its destigmatisation are unlocking opportunities for commitments across organisations. In addition, an expanding evidence base on the growing burden of mental disorders and cost-effective interventions is offering a clearer depiction of the problem and available solutions. Increased public and political support for mental health in source countries is slowly trickling down from domestic to development and foreign policy agendas. Political support and creation of fiscal and regulatory spaces in some recipient countries present 182 favourable conditions for investments. Proliferation of organisations, a nascen t global governance structure and a growing number of high -level and other meetings on mental health are building momentum at global level, spurring awareness and interest. Those barriers and opportunities operate across organisations, thou gh with broad variation depending on organisation type. For instance, clear outcome indicators affect especially organisation driven by social or financial return on investments, simple cost - effective interventions and absorptive capacity in recipient coun tries for -profit organisations, and political and public support in source and recipient countries public organisations. 183 Challenges Opportunities Organisations Lack of individual support, especially at the leadership level Poor understanding of mental health, worsened by stigma Lack of relevance for the organisation's strategic role and priorities Large number of competing priorities Lack of internal capacity Unfavourable characteristics of mental health as an issue New, strong leaders and champions Better understanding of mental health, along with its destigmatisation Expanding evidence base on mental health burden and interventions Source Countries Lack of political and public support Lack of tax incentives Increased pu blic and political support Recipient Countries Lack of political and public support Lack of absorptive capacity and fiscal and regulatory spaces Political support in some recipient countries Fiscal and regulatory spaces in some recipient countries Global Landscape Lack of grassroot organisations Tensions across organisations, especially vis -\u00e0-vis for -profit Missed policy windows Lack of governance structure Proliferation of organisations Growing number of high -level and other meetings on mental health Emerging global governance structure Table 6. 2: Challenges and opportunities for increasing external organisations' investments to mental health in low - and middle -income countries. 184 6.4.2. Limitations This study has some limitations. Qualitative methods raise issues regarding robustness: triangulation across different sources of data aimed to minimise bias. Purposeful sampling may have led to selection bias, especially concerning geographies, though possibly partly mitigated by sampling for diversity according to organisation group. The position of the author (woman, non -native English speaker, trained in clinical psychology and health policy, with over 10 years of experience in mental health policy and practice research, affiliated to a university in the Global North) informed and influenced data collection and analysis (Mikecz, 2012) . It was not possible to record some interviews due to participant preferences. While this meant it was not possible to pr ovide illustrative quotations from them, detailed notes were made and data quality was comparable to recorded interviews (Rutakumwa et al., 2019) . 6.4.3. Recommendations External organisations play crucial roles in addressing mental health needs in LMICs (Collin s et al., 2011) , and are expected to be increasingly important due to demographic and epidemiological transitions and growth in social determinants of mental health such as inequalities (Patel et al., 2018) , which will likely be exacerbated by COVID -19, th e effects of lockdown and its socio -economic consequences (Nicola et al., 2020) . This study points to five strategic actions to increase and amplify external organisations' investments in mental health in LMICs. First, all external organisations (see Chapt er 3) could invest in global mental health through different activities aligned with their missions and priorities to unlock additional resources (see Table 6.1). Growing evidence is available to organisations for contributing to mental health through nume rous entry points, not only within mental health systems and services (e.g. Mental Health Atlas) (WHO, 2018b) , but also across other health conditions (Remien et al., 2019) , sectors (Patel et al., 2016a) and social determinants of mental health (Lund et al ., 2018) . Measuring and evaluating funded activities should be encouraged using available tools (IASC Reference Group for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings, 2017) and frameworks (UN, 2015b; WHO, 2013c) to ensure transparency, accountability and learning. People with lived experience should be part of the process, as citizens, users and consumers (GMHPN, 2020) . 185 Second, source countries could catalyse external organisation investments by increasing political support, through financ ial commitments to organisations in the public sector and incentives for the private and third sectors. Co -funded by Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom in 2018, the Alliance of Champions for Mental Health and Wellbeing aims to catalyse action to add ress mental health (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2018) : country members could amplify their impact, prioritising mental health not only in their domestic but also their development and foreign policy agendas, in particular integrating mental health to C OVID -19 responses. Third, recipient countries could favour external organisation investments by increasing political support and creating fiscal and regulatory spaces. More than 70 LMICs across six regions had prioritised mental health (WHO, 2019) . The Wo rld Health Organization Special Initiative for Mental Health (2019 -2023) is expected to accelerate universal health coverage for mental health in 12 countries and to improve their absorptive capacity (WHO, 2019) . Available tools could be used for mental he alth policy planning and service development, such as the Mental Health Atlas (WHO, 2018b) and guidance packages (WHO, 2020b) . Fourth, a global coordination mechanism involving all actors in global mental health could coordinate and monitor efforts over time, favouring partnerships and improving impact of investments. A global partnership for mental health has been recommended (Vigo et al., 2019) and some smaller coordination groups (e.g. donor group on psychosocial support in humanitarian settings) are emerging, while the recently launched Countdown Global Mental Health 2030 will monitor progresses in mental health across countries globally (Saxena et al., 2019) . Finally, ethical c onsiderations could be integrated into decision -making to ensure sustainable and ethical financing of mental health in LMICs. In particular, sustainability of impact beyond funded activities should be ensured through partnerships with local actors, explori ng the issues associated with the financialisation of global mental health (Stein & Sridhar, 2018) , such as equitable access to health care (Eren Vural, 2017) and 186 conflicts of interest (Fava, 2007) . This is especially critical for organisations in the priv ate sector, as it could help in addressing existing tensions in the global mental health community. The research agenda to understand external organisations' contributions to global mental health continues to expand. Qualitative studies could explore cont ributions of external organisations in different settings and for different mental disorders (e.g. common versus severe mental disorders) using this study's analytical framework to ensure consistency and comparability. Case studies could investigate contri butions of single organisations, including the World Health Organization and the World Bank. Finally, studies could examine ethical issues related to external organisations' commitments, especially across different organisation groups and across for -profit and not -for-profit arms of the same organisation. 6.5. Conclusion Mental health is ascending on the global agenda: existing external organisations are scaling up commitments and new ones are joining. This paper presents an analysis of their investments and mo tivations for investing in mental health in LMICs over the past three decades. It provides an analytical framework for future policy planning and research in sustainable financing for global mental health and global health. It is time to invest: 'the stars are aligning, and we need to act now' (interview 5). 187 Supplementary material Supplement 6.1: Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) SECTION No. SRQR ITEM REPORTED ON PAGE # Title and abstract Title S1 Concise description of the nature and topic of the study Identifying the study as qualitative or indicating the approach (e.g. ethnography, grounded theory) or data collection methods (e.g. interview, focus group) is recommended 162 Abstract S2 Summary of key elements of the study using the abstract format of the intended publication; typically includes background, purpose, methods, results, and conclusions 162 Introduction Problem formulation S3 Description and significance of the problem/phenomenon studied; review of relevant th eory and empirical work; problem statement 162-163 Purpose or research question S4 Purpose of the study and specific objectives or questions 164 Methods Qualitative approach and research paradigm S5 Qualitative approach (e.g. ethnography, grounded theory, case study, phenomenology, narrative research) and guiding theory if appropriate; identifying the research paradigm (e.g. postpositivist, constructivist/ interpretivist) is also recommended; rationalea 164 Researcher characteristics and r eflexivity S6 Researchers' characteristics that may influence the research, including personal attributes, qualifications/ experience, relationship with participants, assumptions, and/or presuppositions; potential or actual interaction between researchers' characteristics and the research questions, approach, methods, results, and/or transferability 181 Context S7 Setting/site and salient contextual factors; rationalea 164 Sampling strategy S8 How and why research participants, documents, or events were selected; criteria for deciding when no further sampling was necessary (e.g. sampling saturation); rationalea 164-166; Box 6.1 Ethical issues pertaining to human subjects S9 Documentation of approval by an appropriate ethics review board and particip ant consent, or 164-165 188 SECTION No. SRQR ITEM REPORTED ON PAGE # explanation for lack thereof; other confidentiality and data security issues Data collection methods S10 Types of data collected; details of data collection procedures including (as appropriate) start and stop dates of data collect ion and analysis, iterative process, triangulation of sources/methods, and modification of procedures in response to evolving study findings; rationalea 164-165 Data collection instruments and technologies S11 Description of instruments (e.g. interview guides, questionnaires) and devices (e.g. audio recorders) used for data collection; if/how the instrument(s) changed over the course of the study 164-166; Supplement 6.3 Units of study S12 Number and relevant characteristics of participants, do cuments, or events included in the study; level of participation (could be reported in results) 165; Supplement 6.2 Data processing S13 Methods for processing data prior to and during analysis, including transcription, data entry, data management and secu rity, verification of data integrity, data coding, and anonymization/deidentification of excerpts 165 Data analysis S14 Process by which inferences, themes, etc., were identified and developed, including the researchers involved in data analysis; usually references a specific paradigm or approach; rationalea 165; Supplement 6.4 Techniques to enhance trustworthiness S15 Techniques to enhance trustworthiness and credibility of data analysis (e.g. member checking, audit trail, triangulation); rationalea 165 Results/findings Synthesis and interpretation S16 Main findings (e.g. interpretations, inferences, and themes); might include development of a theory or model, or integration with prior research or theory 167-177; Table 6.1; Boxes 6.2 and 6.3 Links to empirical data S17 Evidence (e.g. quotes, field notes, text excerpts, photographs) to substantiate analytic findings Supplement 6.5 Discussion Integration with prior work, implications, transferability, and contribution(s) to the field S18 Short summary of main findings; explanation of how findings and conclusions connect to, support, elaborate on, or challenge conclusions of earlier scholarship; discussion of scope of application/generalizability; identification of unique contribution(s ) to scholarship in a discipline or field 177-183; Table 6.2 Limitations S19 Trustworthiness and limitations of findings 181 Other 189 SECTION No. SRQR ITEM REPORTED ON PAGE # Conflicts of interest S20 Potential sources of influence or perceived influence on study conduct and conclusions; how these were managed Acknowledgments Funding S21 Sources of funding and other support; role of funders in data collection, interpretation, and reporting Acknowledgments Adapted from O'Brien et al.

The authors created the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) by searching the literature to identify guidelines, reporting standards, and critical appraisal criteria for qualitative research; reviewing the reference lists of retrieved sources; and contacting experts to gain feedback. The SRQR aims to improve the transparency of all aspects of qualitative research by providing clear standards for reporting qualitative research. aThe rationale should briefly discuss the justification for choosing that theory, approach, method, or technique rather than other options available, the assumptions and limitations implicit in those choices, and how those choices influence study conclusions and transferability. As appropriate, the rationale for several items might be discussed together. 190 Supplement 6.2: Participant characteristics Number of participants (%) Interviews Sex Female 18 (51%) 1,2,3,5,7,9,12,17,18,25,27,28,29,30,31,33,34 ,35 Male 17 (49%) 4,6,8,10,11,13,14,15,16,19,20,21,22,23,24,2 6,32 WHO Regiona African Region 2 of the Americas (31%) 6,15,17, 21,25,27,28,29,32,34,35 European Region 22 (63%) 1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,18,19,20,22,23, 24,26,30,31,33 Organisation group Public sector Bilateral GOs 6 (17%) 6,13,18,29,31,33 Multilateral GOs 6 (17%) 5,11,24,26,28,34 Bilateral DFIs 1 (3%) 27 Multilateral DFIs 1 (3%) 15 Private sector Corporations and SMEs 3 (9%) 21,23,32 Foundations 4 (11%) 1,2,5,9 Third sector Nongovernmental organisations (17%) 3,12,17,19,30,35 Multisector partnerships Global Health Initiatives 1 (3%) 20 Innovation Funds 1 (3%) 14 Others Experts 6 (17%) 7,8,10,16,22,25 DFIs=development financial institutions. organisations.

So, we really started to destigmatise (mental health) and make (it) part of our culture' (interview 21) Within organisations: organisations' mental health capacity 'I'm the mental health advisor for my organisation. This is a new role... and the role is to bring all the organisation into the effort to transform mental health care worldwi de...

But it was not under mental health...it was almost an ethical issue, that if you get to test people and tell them they're (HIV) positive, what is the implication that you have next?' (interview 20) 'I think that was similarly a very important high -level meeting that brought together key agencies, where 194 THEME SUB-THEME EXAMPLE QUOTATIONS also one organisation was very clear about its dedication to invest in mental health, as long as agencies that were coming around the table were also kind of putting forth their own commitment within their own agencies.'

I mean, create an environment where products like the ones that we are investing in can be used, can be recognised as being valuable and useful for treating patients... we call it 'enlightened self - interest'... if by helping others to understand, you may be able to help yourself...'

In the four empirical chapters (Chapters 3 to 6) I address research questions regarding the extent to which external actors invest in mental health in LMICs . In this final chapter I bring together the findings from the four empirical chapters (section 7.1), set out their substantive and methodological contributions to the literature (section 7.2) and their policy implications (section 7.3), present overarching research limitations (section 7.4), and outline future research directions (section 7.5). 7.1. Summary of objectives and findings The aim of this thesis is to improve understanding of the role o f external actors investing in mental health in LMICs . The central research question is: To what extent do external actors invest in mental health in low - and middle -income countries? I address this overarching research question by answering four subsidiar y research questions, each corresponding to identified gaps in the literature. I use a multimethod research design with qualitative and quantitative components informing each other through a cumulative and iterative process, as detailed in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 I seek to address the first identified literature gap, namely the partial evidence on the ecosystem of external actors investing in mental health in LMICs . Two policy reports provide an overview of key groups of donors (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016) and some research funders (Pollitt et al., 2016) for mental health in LMICs , but to my knowledge no typology has been suggested and no systematic mapping has yet been conducted for all external actors. Chapter 3 is guide by the first subsidiary research question: Who are the external actors investing in mental health in low - and middle - income countries and what are their roles? In Chapter 3 I present a new typology of external actors in global health, building on previous research, and I use it to structure a 201 systematic mapping of the evidence on external actors investing in mental health in LMICs to identify opportunities for unlocking additional resources. Findings reveal a large ecosystem of external actors in global mental health including organisations a nd individuals across four groups: public sector, private sector, third sector, and multi -sector partnerships . Yet, evidence is limited in breadth and depth: amongst the 79 studies identified, the majority have been published in the last decade, focus on A frica, and on public sector (bilateral and multilateral governmental organisations) and third sector organisations (nongovernmental organisations). Evidence is particularly scarce for for - profit organisations and individual households. In Chapter 3 I also highlight the need for coordinated efforts and for the use of sustainable and ethical approaches to disbursement. This first empirical chapter lays the foundation for the whole study, informing research design and interpretation of results of the subsequen t empirical chapters (Chapters 4 to 6). In Chapter 4 I continue to address the first literature gap (i.e. ecosystem), but I focus on a specific group of external actors: philanthropy. One study (Charlson et al., 2017) highlights the substantial contributi ons of philanthropy to development assistance for mental health and two policy reports (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016; Pollitt et al., 2016) provide some examples. Yet, to my knowledge, no study has yet scrutinised the role of philanthropy for mental health in LMICs . In Chapter 4 I address this gap by answering the second subsidiary research question: What is the role of philanthropic external actors investing in mental health in low - and middle -income countries? I analyse trends in philanthropic development ass istance for mental health in 156 countries between 2000 and 2015. Findings illuminate its critical role, but also highlight substantial inequalities. While philanthropic contributions more than doubled over 16 years, accounting for one - third of total devel opment assistance for mental between 2000 and 2015, mental disorders received the lowest (0.5%) amount of philanthropic development assistance for health across health conditions. Allocation of philanthropic development assistance for mental health varied broadly, with 37 countries receiving none and only three countries receiving more than US$1 per capita over the entire period. In Chapter 4 I also point to challenges and opportunities for increasing the impact of philanthropy in sustainable mental health financing. 202 In Chapter 5 I address the second literature gap: the scarcity of evidence on allocation of external funding for mental health in LMICs. While the scientific literature stresses the low size of development assistance for mental health (Charlson et al., 2017; B. Gilbert et al., 2015; Liese et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2018; Turner et al., 2017) , in particular relative to recipient country needs (Charlson et al., 2017) , the grey literature identifies some reasons for underinvestment in mental health (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016) . I am not aware that any previous study has explored factors driving allocation of development assistance for mental health. Chapter 5 is guided by the third subsidiary research question: What factors are driving allocation of de velopment assistance for mental health? In this chapter I use a two -part regression model applied to a time series cross -sectional dataset of 142 LMICs between 2000 and 2015 to empirically analyse factors at recipient country -level (needs, interests, polic y environment) potentially associated with allocation of development assistance for mental health. I focus on donors as a group to illuminate their aggregated action and shared responsibilities. Findings show that international donors' disbursements are no t well aligned with mental health needs of recipient countries, and contextual factors (e.g. gross domestic product per capita, disease outbreaks) might be playing more prominent roles in resource allocation. Selection of recipient countries by donors is associated with past receipt, experience of disease outbreaks, and lower gross domestic product per capita and market openness. Allocation of higher amounts of development assistance for mental health per capita is associated with past receipt, lower compet ing health needs and lower gross domestic product per capita, and higher government health expenditure. In Chapter 5 I also reveal opportunities to improve allocation of development assistance for mental health, by better reflecting mental health needs of recipient countries and leveraging synergies across other health conditions and across sectors. Finally, in Chapter 6 I address the third literature gap pertaining to the poor evidence on prioritisation of external investments in mental health in LMICs. A policy analysis draws attention to the failure of mental disorders to rise in the global agenda (Tomlinson & Lund, 2012) . While one study (Chisholm et al., 2019) suggests strategies for increasing external funding, another (Ssebunnya et al., 2018) caution s on their volatility. To my 203 knowledge, no study has yet explored prioritisation of mental health in external organisations' investments in LMICs. In Chapter 6 I address this gap answering the fourth subsidiary research question: How and why have external organisations invested in mental health in low- and middle -income ? Using 35 elite interviews and documentary analyses, I examine to what extent external organisations have invested in mental health in LMICs over the last three decades and changes over time . After reporting organisations' activities, I analyse factors shaping organisational decisions at four levels: organisations, source countries, recipient countries, and global landscape. Findings reveals that external organisations have invested in mental health in LMICs through numerous internal and external activities, and that actors have been the most important factor shaping organisational decisions at all four levels: leaders and champions within organisations, political leaders in both source and re cipient countries, and a group of charismatic individuals and grassroots organisations at the global level. In addition, in Chapter 6 I point to challenges and opportunities for increasing external organisations' investments in mental health in LMICs for s ustainable mental health financing. 7.2. Contributions to the literature I believe that I have made four substantive and three methodological contributions to the literature on sustainable (mental) health financing in LMICs, in particular on the literature on external actors. While detailed discussions of findings are provided within each empirical chapter (Chapters 3 to 6), in this section I offer a critical overview of the key contributions of this thesis as a whole. 7.2.1. Substantive contributions In this thesis I reveal the existence of a large ecosystem of external actors investing in mental health in LMICs , including organisations and individuals across the public, private and third sectors, and multi -sector partnerships. In line with conceptuali sations in development finance (Rao, 2003) , I also move beyond the existing literature predominantly focused on donations (Charlson et al., 2017; B. Gilbert et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2018; Turner et al., 2017) to define investments in terms of both financia l and non - financial (e.g. drugs and services) contributions and both profitable and non -profitable pursuits. In Chapter 3 I point to the existence of various for -profit organisations and 204 individuals already active in global health which could unlock additi onal resources for mental health in LMICs. For instance, amongst organisations, commitments of development finance institutions in the public sector grew from US$10billion in 2002 to US$70billion in 2014 (Savoy et al., 2016) , of which a small (2 -3%) prop ortion went to health care (Kenny et al., 2018) , possibly including investments in mental health care. Foreign direct investments in the private sector constitute the largest (39%, US$671billion) external source of finance in LMICs, though the amount at tracted by health care is small (Smith et al., 2009) and by mental health is unknown. Amongst individuals, the wealth of high -net-worth individuals amounts to over US$70trillion and is expected to reach US$100trillion by 2025 (Capgemini, 2018) , some of w hich could go to mental health (e.g. US$100million of personal investments committed by Bill Gates to fight dementia) (Kelland, 2017) . In addition, the grow th in contributions from a larger group of individuals, diaspora movements, through remittances (US $429billion in 2016) is expected to continue (Ratha et al., 2018) . They represent the second most important source of external financing in LMICs (24%) (UNCTAD, 2018) , but their contribution to mental health is unknown. While a previous study (Charlson et al., 2017) highlights the increasing importance of philanthropy for mental health in LMICs, in my research I offer a closer look at its growing and prominent role in development assistance for mental health. In Chapter 4 I report a surge in philanthropy for global mental health, which has doubled between 2000 and 2015, in line with a similar growth in philanthropy for global health (Youde, 2018) . Philanthropy plays a crucial role in mental health: its contributions repres ent a considerable share (one -third) of development assistance for mental health compared to a smaller percentage (12%) in development assistance for health (Dieleman et al., 2016) . However, it represents a small (0.5%) share of philanthropic development a ssistance for health, in line with a similar modest share of philanthropy attracted by mental health in high -income countries (Brousseau et al., 2003) . In addition, reflecting similar trends in total development assistance for mental health (Charlson et al ., 2017; B. Gilbert et al., 2015) and development assistance for health (Dieleman et al., 2014) , philanthropic development assistance for mental health is unevenly allocated. For example, the region 205 where the majority of people with mental disorders live, South East Asia (26%) (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018e) , received only 17% of philanthropic development assistance for mental health. With this thesis I believe that I advance the literature on allocation of external resources for su stainable mental health financing, analysing factors driving the allocation of development assistance for mental health. In Chapter 5 I reveal that development assistance for mental health is not well aligned with mental health needs, in line with similar evidence across health conditions (Charlson et al., 2017; Dieleman et al., 2014) . This misalignment could partly be attributed to the lack of understanding of mental disorders within the donor community (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016). I also highlight the impo rtance of contextual factors at the recipient country -level in the allocation of development assistance for mental health, such as competing health needs, gross domestic product per capita, and disease outbreaks. The negative impact of competing health nee ds on allocation of development assistance for mental health corroborates results from a policy report (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016) exploring the reasons for underinvestment in mental disorders in LMICs, and literature on aid displacement (Lordan et al., 201 1). In line with the broader literature that suggests 'poverty selectivity' in allocation of development assistance (Peiffer & Boussalis, 2015), findings show a negative impact of gross dometic product per capita on disbursements, meaning that countries with lower standards of living are more likely to receive resources. This also suggests that donors may understand the vicious circle between poverty and mental disorders (i.e. people living with mental disorders are at higher risk of falling into poverty, a nd poor people are at higher risk of mental illness) (Lund et al., 2011) . Similarly, the positive impact of disease outbreaks on allocation of development assistance for mental health suggests that donors may understand the higher prevalence of mental diso rders during humanitarian emergencies (Charlson et al., 2019) . Finally, with this thesis I hope that I contribute to the literature on prioritisation of mental health in external investments in LMICs . In Chapter 6, I analyse external organisations' invest ments in mental health in LMICs taking a broader view across organisations and over time. I reveal numerous internal and external activities, six arguments used to make 206 the case for investment, and two investment strategies. WHO describes similar arguments to advocate for resources in mental health, such as public health, economic welfare, economic growth and productivity, equity, sociocultural influence, and political influence (WHO, 2013b) . In addition, in this chapter I shed light on factors shaping exte rnal organisations' decisions, identifying barriers and opportunities for increasing their investments in mental health in LMICs at four levels: organisations, source and recipient countries, and global landscape. Findings emphasise the prominent role of actors in shaping organisational decisions and spurring investment, in line with the vast literature on norm entrepreneurs, which sets actors as catalysts for change in global health organisations (Kamradt -Scott, 2010) . Amongst barriers to external organisa tions' investments in mental health at the organisation level, I identify lack of individual support especially among leaders, poor understanding of the issue (worsened by stigma), unfavourable contexts, such as lack of relevance for the organisation's str ategic role and priorities, competing priorities, and lack of internal capacity. Three of those barriers concur with previous studies: poor understanding of mental health, stigma, and competing priorities (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016; Saraceno et al., 2007) . Another obstacle is the set of characteristics of mental health as an issue: lack of clear outcome indicators, low availability and poor quality of data, and lack of simple cost -effective interventions. While previous studies (Mackenzie & Kesner, 2016; Sar aceno et al., 2007) corroborate the role of poor metrics in hampering investments in mental health in LMICs , it is worth cautioning on potential problems mental health metrics could face, including distorting priorities (Storeng & B\u00e9hague, 2017) and narrow ing the policy agenda (Storeng & B\u00e9hague, 2014) . In Chapter 6, I identify two main obstacles at the source and recipient country -level: lack of political and public support and unfavourable contexts in source (e.g. low tax incentives) and recipient (e.g. lack of absorptive capacity, lack of fiscal and regulatory spaces) countries. However, political interest in mental health is emerging in LMICs (Chisholm et al., 2019) and, contrary to common perceptions, low -income countries and less developed health sys tems have been shown to be more likely to use received contributions, especially when politically stable (Lu et al., 2006) . Lastly and in line with a previous study (Tomlinson & Lund, 2012) , I identify three main challenges at the global 207 level: lack of gra ssroots organisations, tensions across organisations especially vis -\u00e0-vis for-profit organisations, and unfavourable context (e.g. missed policy windows, lack of global governance structure). In particular, the financialisation of global health (i.e. the increase in size and influence of financial institutions and markets) (Krech et al., 2018) and the rise of philanthropy (Stuckler et al., 2011) in global health has led to an increase in tensions with for -profit organisations and conflicts of interest. Similar issues such as incohesive communities, unexploited windows of opportunities, and fragmented global governance have hindered the generation of political attention for other global health issues (Shiffman, 2010; Shiffman & Smith, 2007) . 7.2.2. Methodological contributions I believe that I have made three methodological contributions: two analytical tools and applications of existing methodologies t o mental health financing. In Chapter 1 I offer a new typology of external actors for global health (including global mental health), bringing together and expanding previous categorisations used in the global health governance (Frenk & Moon, 2013) and g lobal health financing (McCoy et al., 2009) literature. In the new typology I identify different types of actors that I organise across four groups: public sector (bilateral and multilateral governmental organisations, bilateral and multilateral developmen t finance institutions), private sector (corporations and small and medium enterprises, foundations, individuals), third sector (nongovernmental organisations, professional associations, research centres) and multi - sector partnerships (global health initia tives, innovation funds). The classification of external actors across those four groups (public sector, private sector, third sector, multi - sector partnership) allows me to highlight not only commonalities across external actors (e.g. legal status and mod us operandi ), but also parallels with corresponding domestic actors. In this chapter I also offer a visual depiction of the typology accompanied by its detailed description in a separate box to facilitate future use. While in Chapter 1 I offer an example o f its use in mental health, the new typology could be applied to other health issues. 208 In Chapter 6 I provide an analytical framework to study prioritisation amongst external organisations investing in global health in LMICs . Partly informed by Shiffman an d Smith (2007) framework, the analytical framework consists of two themes and seven sub - themes. The first theme allows for a critical exploration of funded activities, including a detailed description of their typology, arguments used to make the case for investment, and investment strategies. The second theme permits to analyse factors shaping organisational decisions at four levels: organisations, source countries where organisations are legally registered (not applicable to multilateral actors), recipien t countries, and global landscape. To facilitate future use, I accompany the description of the analytical framework in the main text by its visual representation in the supplementary material. The versatility of the analytical framework means that it can be used to better the understanding not only across external organisations, but also over time. Similar to the new typology, the framework could be applied to other health issues beyond mental health. Finally, I provide a working example of the applicatio n of methods commonly used in the development assistance literature to development assistance for mental health (Peiffer & Boussalis, 2015) . In Chapter 5 I use a two -part regression model applied to a time series cross -sectional dataset of 142 LMICs betwee n 2000 and 2015 to empirically explore factors driving allocation of development assistance for mental health, distinguishing between two related decisions: selection and allocation of contributions across recipient countries. Identified country -level indi cators available in time series cross -sectional datasets, reporting data across countries and over time, could be used in future research at the macro level. The empirical model and analytical strategy could be adapted to study disbursements amongst sub -groups of donors and regions, ensuring the centrality of recipient countries and focusing on donors as a group to illuminate their collective action and shared responsibilities. My approach offers an alternative to the study of allocation of development assi stance through gravity models, which are often used to look at donor and recipient countries as dyads requiring different model specifications for different donor groups (e.g. bilateral governmental organisations, multilateral governmental organisations, p hilanthropy). 209 7.3. Policy implications With this thesis I try to advance policy discussion on sustainable mental health financing in LMICs countries, highlighting the role played by external actors . This is even more crucial considering the expected increase i n mental health needs in LMICs spurred by demographic and epidemiological changes and an increase in adverse social determinants of mental health (Patel et al., 2018) , which will likely be aggravated by COVID -19 and policy responses to it such as quarantin e (Brooks et al., 2020) . While detailed policy recommendations are provided within each empirical chapter (Chapters 3 to 6), in this section I outline five key policy implications for the whole thesis . 7.3.1. A large ecosystem of external actors In this thesis I reveal a large ecosystem of external actors already investing in mental health in LMICs , and opportunities for unlocking additional resources . In line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (UN, 2015a) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015b) which recommend the mobilisation of additional external funding from a wide range of sources (e.g. development assistance, foreign direct investments, remittances) along with a gradual increase in domes tic resources to assure sustainability, I move beyond donors. I define investments to include both profitable and non -profitable pursuits and both financial and in -kind contributions . In Chapter 3 I illuminate a large ecosystem of external actors. Their va riety and multitude suggest untapped resources could be mobilised and collaborations should be preferred to the establishment of new organisations. For instance, while the WHO Independent High -Level Commission on non - communicable diseases proposes a multi -donor fund for non -communicable diseases and mental health (Nishtar et al., 2018) , its establishment could further fragment and possibly duplicate efforts. I position recipient countries at the centre of the ecosystem of external actors to reinstate their centrality in policy planning and financing. The new typology presented in Chapter 3 not only places recipient countries at its centre but also organises external actors in four groups (public sector, private sector, third sector, multi -sector partnership s) commonly used for domestic actors to facilitate comparisons. Similarly, recipient countries are at the centre of the empirical model used in Chapter 5 and amongst factors 210 shaping organisational decisions in the analytical framework presented in Chapter 6. This reflects two main development principles: the principle of local ownership stressed by the aid effectiveness agenda from the Rome Declaration on Harmonisation (OECD, 2003) to the Busan Partnership Agreement (OECD, 2011) , and the principle of sustai nability emphasised by the agenda on financing for development from the Monterrey Consensus (UN, 2003) to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (UN, 2015a) . In addition, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015b) , I frame the debate in terms o f partnerships across countries. Hence, I recognise the role of LMICs as both recipients and sources of investments in global health. As evidenced by the Bogota Statement (Stearing Committee, 2010) and the Busan Partnership Agreement (OECD, 2011) , the importance of South -South cooperation has grown in development and global health, i n particular vis -\u00e0-vis upper middle -income countries (Micah et al., 2019) . To facilitate its use amongst non -academic audiences, the new typology of external actors is available as a separate research and policy tool (Iemmi, 2019c) (see Appendix 7.1) and Chapters 3 and 4 (Iemmi, 2019b, 2020b) (see Appendices 7.2 and 7.3).9 7.3.2. Better allocation of external investments In this thesis I raise concerns about equity in the allocation of external investments in mental health in LMICs , and recognise the need for improvement, especially vis -\u00e0-vis development assistance for mental health. Since the 2000s, better allocation of development assistance has driven numer ous high -level forums on aid effectiveness and agreements, including the Rome Declaration on Harmonisation (OECD, 2003) , Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (OECD, 2005) , Accra Agenda for Action (OECD, 2008) , and Busan Partnership for Effective Developm ent Co -operation Agreement (OECD, 2011) . While evidence on allocation of development assistance for health across scientific publications (Bump, 2018) and policy reports (Equitable Access Initiative, 2016; Ottersen et al., 2014) has informed policy -making, little is known on allocation of development 9 Chapter 3 infographic was awarded the Highly Commended Festival Prize at the LSE Festival Research Competition 2020 ( see Appendix 7. 4). 211 assistance for mental health (Charlson et al., 2017; Persaud et al., 2018b) . In Chapter 5 I demonstrate that international donors investing in mental health in LMICs are not adequately responding to mental heal th needs of recipient countries , and contextual factors (e.g. gross domestic product per capita, disease outbreaks) might be playing more prominent roles in resource allocation. I also highlight opportunities for improvement. Allocation of development as sistance for mental health should better reflect the mental health needs of recipient countries. While resource allocation requires a careful choice of multiple indicators (Ottersen et al., 2018) , health needs have been foregrounded in more recent discussi ons (Haakenstad et al., 2018) and valued more than income per capita by recipient countries (Grepin et al., 2018) . In line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (UN, 2015a) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015b) , donors could systematically include countries' preferences and priorities (Grepin et al., 2018) at the allocation stage and adopt a long -term approach (K. Gilbert et al., 2019) to favour local ownerships and sustainability of programmes beyond funded activities (Kiendr ebeogo & Meessen, 2019) . In this view, disbursements could better target recipients where mental health needs are increased, such as fragile contexts (Charlson et al., 2019) requiring targeted responses during the crisis (IASC, 2007) and the recovery perio d (WHO, 2013a) . In particular, cognisant of the effect of COVID -19 and the policy responses to it (Vigo et al., 2020) , increased disbursements for mental health could be integrated in the COVID - 19 crisis response and recovery funds. To reflect the high co morbidity of mental with communicable and non -communicable disorders (Mendenhall et al., 2017; Remien et al., 2019) and their key role in both their treatment and recovery, disbursements could be increased by including mental health components in activitie s targeting other health conditions . This synergetic approach could strengthen health system response in LMICs , currently facing an unprecedented double challenge of a growing population of people living with communicable disorders (GBD 2017 HIV Collaborat ors, 2019) and an increasing burden of non -communicable disorders (GBD 2017 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, 2018) . In addition, disbursements could be expanded beyond health and across sectors, recognising both the impact of mental disorders in multiple dime nsions of people's lives (Patel et al., 2018) and the multiplicity 212 of social determinants of mental health (Lund et al., 2018) . In particular, the well - established link between poverty and mental disorders could constitute a privileged entry point to scale up investments through inclusion of both aspects (Lund et al., 2011) . 7.3.3. Amplification of external organisations' investments In this thesis I demonstrate that all external actors could contribute to mental health in LMICs through different activities aligned with their missions and priorities. In Chapter 6 I offer an extended account of external organisations' investments in mental health in LMICs. In particular, I summarise a broad range of activities: internally, including investments in employees' mental health and mental health capacity; and externally, from incorporation of mental health requirements into funded projects, to stand -alone programmes, integration into existing priorities, new priority areas, and use of organisations' convening power to advance the global mental health agenda. I also highlight six different arguments used by external organisations to make the case for investment in mental health (pu blic health, human rights, economic, country priorities, moral, and happiness) and two main investment strategies: pushing mental health as a stand -alone issue, and integrating mental health programmes and activities within existing priorities. The integra tion strategy has emerged and gained prominence along with the growing evidence supporting investments in mental health through numerous entry points, not only within mental health systems and services (e.g. Mental Health Atlas) (WHO, 2018b) , but also acro ss other health conditions (e.g. HIV/AIDS) (Remien et al., 2019) , sectors (e.g. education, employment, criminal justice) (Patel et al., 2016a) , and social determinants of mental health (Lund et al., 2018) . In this view, in Chapter 4 I suggest that philanth ropic organisations could scale -up their efforts integrating mental health into their priorities, as illustrated for 15 large international foundations by the Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development (Patel et al., 2018, online Supplementary Table S5). However, unleashing funding through separate actions at the service of external actors' interests and priorities could amplifying currently co-existing divergent understanding of mental disorders (e.g. biomedical versus human rights) and required actions (e.g. drugs versus social inclusion) (Maj et al., 2002; Puras & Gooding, 2019) . For instance, external actors might prefer to channel new funding through vertical programmes with short -term impact, possibly displacing them from 213 other competing issues (e.g. Shiffman, 2008) , instead of adopting a sustainable horizontal approach targeting health system and society as a whole. In addition, in this thesis I points to opportunities for increasing and amplifying external organisations' i nvestments in mental health in LMICs. In particular, in Chapter 6 I point to strategic actions at three levels: source countries, recipient countries, and global landscape. S ource countries could spur external organisations' investments by increasing polit ical support, through financial commitments to organisations in the public sector and incentives for the private and third sectors. For instance, members of the Alliance of Champions for Mental Health and Wellbeing (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2018) , which was co -funded by Australia, Canada, and the UK in 2018, could expand their impact, prioritising mental health not only in their domestic but also their development and foreign policy agendas (e.g. integrating mental health into COVID -19 responses). However, caution is called on imposing source countries' understanding of mental disorders and their solutions on recipient countries (Summerfield, 2008) . There is no one - size-fits-all solution in mental health. Source countries could be guided by evidence f rom anthropological studies exploring cultural presentations and understanding of mental disorders (e.g. Kleinman, 1987) and anthropological and public health studies on context - specific solution (e.g. Chibanda et al., 2015) . Recipient countries could fac ilitate external organisations' commitments by increasing political support and creating fiscal and regulatory spaces. This is especially relevant for more than 70 LMICs across six regions which had already prioritised mental health, and for the 12 amongst them expected to accelerate universal health coverage for mental health and to improve their absorptive capacity through the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health (2019 -2023) (WHO, 2019) . Mental health policy planning and service development in LMICs could benefit from the use of available policy tools, such as the Mental Health Atlas (WHO, 2018b) and guidance packages (WHO, 2020b) . However, caution is warranted as this could lead to distortion of recipient country priorities (Ollila, 2005) and dependen cy on external investments (Khan et al., 2018) . In line with the principles of local ownership and sustainability (UN, 2015a) , recipient country priorities should be always at the forefront, informing funding decisions in both source and 214 recipient countrie s in order to reflect local needs and wants, and to favour long -term sustainability of investments beyond funded activities. This is crucial to avoid dependency on external investments , often volatile and fungible (i.e. partially displacing government ment al health budgets) (Moon & Omole, 2017) . Finally, a global coordination mechanism involving all actors in global mental health could enable coordination and monitoring of efforts over time. While experts have recommended a global partnership for mental he alth (Vigo et al., 2019) , some smaller coordination groups are emerging, such as the Inter -Agency Standing Committee reference group on mental health and psychosocial support in emergency settings established in 2007, the International Alliance for Mental Health Research Funders in 2010, and the first permanent donor group on psychosocial support in humanitarian settings in 2018. However, the establishment of such mechanism might face problems commons to other multi -stakeholder governance mechanisms, such a s possible distortions of recipient country priorities (Biesma et al., 2009) , disruption of health systems (e.g. human resources) and equity issues (e.g. focus on easily -accessible high - density areas) (Hanefeld, 2010) , and dependency on external resources (Chima & Homedes, 2015) . 7.3.4. Data In this thesis I emphasise the need for better and more disaggregated data from all external actors to improve both planning and accountability . Data are critical to support the work of organisations tracking development assistance (IHME, OECD, UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) and monitoring global progress in ment al health (Countdown Global Mental Health 2030) (Saxena et al., 2019) , which is required to inform policy planning and funding decisions, and ultimately for sustainable financing for global mental health. While all empirical chapters (Chapters 3 to 6) call attention to it, in Chapters 3 and 4 I shed a light on the dearth of and need for data from organisations and individuals in the private sector. 215 7.3.5. Ethical issues In this thesis I stress the importance of integrating ethical considerations into decision - mak ing and monitoring processes to ensure sustainable and ethical mental health financing in LMICs . In particular, issues related to the financialisation of global health (Stein & Sridhar, 2018) , including equitable access to health care (Eren Vural, 2017) and conflicts of interest (Fava, 2007) . In Chapter 3 I recommend the integration of ethical considerations during the establishment of partnerships across external actors from different sectors, in order to preserve core values in global mental health while unlocking untapped resources. Similarly, in Chapter 6 I propose careful consideration of possible ethical issues during the establishment of partnerships between external and domestic actors, in particular pertaining sustainability of impact beyond funded activities. The integration of ethical considerations into decision -making and monitoring processes could be especially critical for organisations in the private sector, as it could help in addressing existing tensions in the global mental health community . 7.4. Limitations While details are provided within each empirical chapter (Chapters 3 to 6), in this section I summarise three types of limitations applying to the whole thesis across the qualitative and quantitative components: data, methods, and focus. 7.4.1. Data The first set of limitations concerns data used in this study . Amongst data used in the quantitative component (Chapters 4 and 5), limitations apply to both data on development assistance for mental health and data on factors associated with its alloca tion. While the dataset on development assistance for mental health produced by IHME was the best source of information available at the time of the analyses, it is limited in breadth, depth, scope, granularity, robustness, and heterogeneity. Data are limi ted in breadth: estimates do not include development assistance from other LMICs which are gaining importance in global health (Micah et al., 2019) and philanthropic estimates focus predominantly on US foundations. However, the latter represent almost thre e-quarters of philanthropy for development (OECD, 2018) . Data are limited in depth: estimates are conservative for some organisations. For instance, development assistance for health 216 channelled through global health initiatives and some multilateral governmental organisations (United Nations Children's Fund, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS) is classified by IHME under health conditions constituting organisations' focus, although programmes may also include mental health components (IHME, 2018b) . Data are limited in scope: they focus on health only, potentially excluding sectors directly or indirectly relevant to mental health (e.g. education, employment) (Lund et al., 2 018) . Data are limited in granularity: they lack information on recipient countries for the majority of contributions, and on activities funded and population targeted. This restricted the analyses in Chapter 5 to disbursements into known recipients. While other datasets (e.g. aid activities dataset from OECD Creditor Reporting System, OECD -CRS) offer some of this information, mental health data would have needed to be extracted manually requiring time and resources beyond the scope of this study. Data are limited in robustness: they lack accurate reporting before 2000 and report preliminary estimates post -2015. This circumscribed analyses to the period between 2000 and 2015, yet facilitated meaningful interpretation with a focus on the Millennium Developmen t Goals era to inform the Sustainable Development Goals era. Finally, data include some neurological conditions (epilepsy, headache disorders, Parkinson's disease) which may inflate estimates: this reflects prior conceptualisation of mental disorders due t o the fact that their service provision is often combined in LMICs (WHO, 2008 b). DAMH data limitations reflect customary challenges and trade -offs in the collection of secondary financial data across different organisations and over time: availability of h uman and financial resources required to collect better data, possible inaccuracies due to the use of different classifications and measurements across sources, confidentiality issues especially regarding organisations and individuals in the private sector . In Box 7.1 I critically reflect on methodological limitations of the dataset on development assistance for mental health produced by IHME , suggest ing opportunities for improvement . Box 7.1: IHME dataset on development assistance for mental health Currently the most comprehensive source on development assistance for mental health , the IHME dataset has some methodological limitations in data collection, mental health activity identification, estimation s, and reporting. 217 Data collection The first set of limitations concern s data collection, in particular the breadth of sources. While e xternal actors investing in mental health in LMICs are numerous ( see Chapter 3 ) and their contributions to sustainable financing encouraged (UN, 2015b ), many of them are not represented in the IHME dataset . For instance, LMIC donors are gaining in importance in global health, yet only China is currently included (Micah et al., 2019) . They might lack accurate and regular reporting needed for time series c ross-sectional datasets, but better data are becoming available in repositories (e.g. AidData) (AidData, 2020) and institutional websites of bilateral and multilateral organisations , especially for upper middle -income countries (e.g. Brazilian Development Bank, New Development Bank) (BNDES, 2020; NDB, 2020). Similarly, t he role of philanthropy in global health is growing (Youde, 2018), yet philanthropic estimates in the IHME dataset focus predominantly on US foundations. Although those represent almost three -quarters of philanthropy for development (OECD, 2018) , contribut ions from philanthropic organisations outside the US could differ . The OECD dataset on private philanthropy for development constitutes a promising source of data (OECD, 2018). However, philanthrop ic disbursements for mental health are not currently estima ted and their identification is hampered by the lack of access to activity - level data due to strict confidentiality agreement with data providers . Even though ad hoc searches can be requested , their accuracy depends on availability and skills of OECD staff (see Section 2.3). In addition, mental health is gaining traction amongst private research funders outside the US, such as the Wellcome Trust which in 2020 made mental health a priority area (Wellcome Trust, 2021). Data on their contributions could be harnessed from the Dimensions database (Digital Science, 2021). A commercial product, it contains information at activity level on about 4.6 million grants disbursed by over 340 research funders worldwide (Bode et al., 2019). Its men tal health research data have been recently improved as a result of a collaboration with the International Alliance of Mental Health Research Funders (Woelbert et al., 2020). 218 Mental health activity identification The second set of limitations concerns the identification of mental health activities: breadth of key words , scope, and depth. The IHME search strategy currently may inflate estimates includ ing key words not only on mental health and mental disorders (including substance use disorders, dementia, s elf-harm ) but also on some neurological conditions (epilepsy, headache disorders, Parkinson's disease) . This approach reflects prior conceptualisation of mental disorders due to the fact that their service provision is often combined in LMICs (WHO, 2008 b). The exclusion of neurological conditions could better align with more recent approaches as shown by separate estimate s of the global burden of disease for neurological disorders ( GBD 2015 Neurological Disorders Collaborator Group , 2017). In addition , the increased prominence of mental health in the global discourse (Kleinman et al., 2016) could increase the risk of donor gaming for reputational purposes , with a looser use of mental health -related key words in project descriptions . The s ystematic audit of a random sample of projects and adap tation of search strateg ies could help reduce the problem . The IHME dataset is limited in scope, focusing on the health sector only. This is at odds with the integrated strategy , which has gained prominence and success over the last decade , and has led to the integrati on of mental health programmes and activities within different sectors (e.g. education, employment, criminal justice) (Patel et al., 2016a) and themes (e.g. gender, disability, youth) (Lund et al., 2018) (see Chapter 6) . The exclusion of sectors beyond health risks to provide an inaccurate picture of total investments in mental health. Data on development assistance in sectors beyond health are available in databases already used by IHME (e.g. aid activities data base from the Creditor Reporting System of the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and D evelopment , CRS ) (OECD, 2019) and other publicly available databases (e.g. Financial Tracking Service database of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ) (UN OCHA, 2017 ). In particular, the inclusion of humanitarian assistance could improve the understanding of external investments in humanitarian settings, where mental health needs increase (Charlson et al., 2019) and are addressed through mental health programmes and activities supported by both huma nitarian and development assistance (WHO, 2013a). 219 The IHME dataset is limited in depth: estimates are conservative for some organisations and activities . Development assistance for health channelled through global health initiatives and some multilateral governmental organisations (United Nations Children's Fund, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS) is classified by IHME under health conditions constituting organisations' focus, although programmes may also include mental health components (IHME , 2018b). Disbursements at the health system level which are not exclusively earmarked but that may benefit mental health are not included in DAMH. This is equally at odds with the integrated strategy , which has promote d the integration of mental health pr ogrammes and activities within different health conditions (e.g. HIV/AIDS) (Remien et al., 2019) and levels of care (e.g. primary care) (WHO, 2008 a). Estimations The third set of limitations concern s IHME estimation approaches vis-\u00e0-vis poor data quality . To address under -reporting and reporting lags for earlier years IHME adjusts disbursements using CRS commitments and disbursement data from the Development Assistance Committee database of the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (IHME, 2018b) . For the most recent two years, IHME estimates disbursements using regression models . This approach differs from other datasets where unadjusted figures are preferred (Gilbert et al., 2015; Pitt et al., 2018 ). IHME deals with projects with more than one focus area divid ing contributions across health focus areas proportionally to the number of key words present in the project's title and description . Other datasets adopt different approaches. For instance, t he H arvard dataset on development assistance for mental health estimates DAMH as upper bounds , including the full amount of funding to projects including at least one mental health - related key word in the project title (Gilbert et al., 2015) (see Appendix 2.1) . Data reporting The final set of limitations relate to the granularity of data reported, in terms of mental health activities, recipient countries, and philanthropic funding . The IHME dataset does 220 not provide data disaggregated at the activ ity level, which could permit more granular analyses and understanding of the quality of disbursements, in particular across different mental disorders (e.g. common and severe mental disorders) and population groups (e.g. by age, gender, ethnicity). While detailed project description s may not be available for all disbursements due to poor quality of reporting in collected data or could not be shared due to confidentiality agreement s with data providers, some of the sources use d by IHME already provide data disaggregated at the activ ity level (e.g. CRS database ) (OECD, 2019). The lack of information on recipient countries for the majority of contributions limits the interpretation of data and their use (see Chapter 5). To address the poor quality of reporting in collected data , IHME reallocates regional DAMH equally to each country in the specified region , yet excluding g lobal and unspecified funding from country estimates (IHME, 2018b) (see Appendix 2.1) . Different approaches have been used to deal with this problem. For instance, the Harvard dataset on development assistanc e for mental health include s regional, global and unspecified DAMH estimates for each recipient country, reallocating them based on the country's share in total DAMH during the year (Gilbert et al., 2015) (see Appendix 2.1). A similar approach is used in datasets tracking development assistance for other health conditions (e.g. Pitt et al., 2018). Reallocation of global and unspecified funding to recipient countries could enhance estimates at country level. The dearth of information on philanthropic fundin g means that philanthropic organisation name is provided for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) only (see Chapter 4). The poor quality of data reflects the lack of transparency of philanthropic donors in development (OECD, 2018) . Additional philanthropic organisation name s can be accessed by request, yet only at the channel level and only for US foundations . Their interpretation calls for cautio n: for instance, between 2000 and 2015 BMGF disbursed the majority of DAMH ( 85% ) through nongovernmental organisations and United Nations agencies (Charlson et al., 2017) , suggest ing that other US foundations could disburse the majority of their funding through other channels. The OECD dataset on private philanthropy for development constitute s a potentially promising source of data at the source level (OEC D, 2018). Reporting at source level could provide a better understanding 221 of the role of philanthropic organisations, which are crucial actors in global mental health (see Chapter 4). These four sets of data limitations reflect customary challenges and trade -offs in the collection of secondary financial data across different organisations and over time: availability of human and financial resources required to collect better data, possible inaccuracies due to the use of different classifications and measurements across sources, and confidentiality issues especially regarding organisations and individuals in the private sector. Continuous reassessment and improvement of the methodology used to create the IHME dataset is crucial not only as a technical pursuit, but also to facilitate its political and normative use (Shiffman and Shawar, 2020). Beyond data on development assistance for mental health, data on factors associated with its allocatio n used in Chapter 5 present limitation due to poor quality or lack of available panel datasets. Poor quality of available data meant that government health expenditure was used as a proxy for government mental health expenditure and indicators for country mental health capacity (e.g. number of mental health workers) were not included. Lack of available data meant that some countries and territories were excluded from the analyses .10 Some of them could have represented important recipients of development ass istance for mental health, such as those experiencing conflicts and natural disasters ( e.g. Palestine). Looking at the qualitative component of this thesis, four main limitations apply to data collected through in -depth interviews in Chapter 6: sampling, interview medium, recordings, and completeness. Purposeful sampling could have introduced selection bias especially regarding participant geographies: this bias was possibly mitigated by sampling 10 Twelve countries and territories were excluded from Chapter 4 analyses: Anguilla, Cook Islands, Mayotte, Montserrat, Nauru, Niu e, Saint Helena, Saint Martin, Tokelau, Turks and Caicos Islands, Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna Islands . Twenty -six countries and territories were discarded from Chapter 5 analyses : Anguilla, Cook Islands, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kosovo, Mayott e, Montserrat, Nauru, Niue, North Korea, Palau, Palestine, Romania, Saint Helena, Saint Martin, Sao Tome and Principe, Somalia, St Kitts and Nevis, Syria, Timor Leste, Tokelau, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna Island s, Yemen. 222 for diversity according to organisation groups. Different g eographies meant that some interviews were conducted via telephone or Skype (instead of face -to-face) to increase the variety of the sample (Lo Iacono et al., 2016) . While the amount of participant talks in telephone and Skype interviews is sometimes reduc ed (Irvine, 2011) especially when both trust and rapport need to be established, the use of gatekeepers favoured their depth and quality. Participant preferences did not allow for recording some interviews, yet the use of detailed notes ensured comparable data quality (Rutakumwa et al., 2019) . Finally, the ascent of mental health on the agenda globally during this study meant that some participants represented organisations which were undergoing internal strategical discussions vis -\u00e0-vis investments in ment al health in LMICs at the time of the data collection, hence interviews may have only partially captured the content of those (often confidential and ongoing) exchanges. 7.4.2. Methods The second set of limitations regards the methods used to analyse data in this study . Three limitations can be identified in relation to the quantitative component in Chapter 5: model choice, causality, and simplification of reality. First, the empirical m odel and analytical strategy present limitations, yet their choice was informed by multiple theoretical and empirical considerations described in detail in Chapter 5. I used a two - part model (Cragg, 1971) to reflect the two stages of the resource allocatio n process: country selection and resource allocation (Stubbs et al., 2016) . I included in the model year fixed effects to account for annual shocks and adopted the clustered standard errors estimator to correct for serial correlation within recipient count ries. During the process, I explored and discarded three alternative models (fixed -effects models, random -effects models, gravity models) and three estimation techniques (single -step estimation techniques such as Tobit, Heckman's two lised Method GMM estimator) (see Chapter 5). Second, analysing causality is beyond the scope of this study. However, the use of distributed lag models with times series cross -sectional datasets introduced a temporal dimension that allowed re plication of the temporality of the decision -making process. I assumed a two -year lag to reflect information available to decision -makers at the time of 223 allocation of development assistance for mental health (i.e. year preceding disbursements) (Neumayer, 2 005) and an additional one -year lag for humanitarian shocks to reflect the faster availability of information on emergencies and disbursement of emergency funds. Different lags were tested during robustness checks. Finally, it is worth remembering that mod els used are necessarily simplifications of the more complex disbursement process (McCoy et al., 2009) . Two limitations can be highlighted in relation to the qualitative analyses in Chapter 6: causality and robustness. While causality is beyond the scope of this study, I added a temporal dimension analysing factors shaping the decision -making process of external organisations and their changes over three decades. While robustness is a common critique faced by qualitativ e methods, triangulation across different sources of data (in - depth interviews and documents) can help to reduce bias. Triangulation is commonly used in social science, especially in qualitative methods, as a powerful tool to further the understanding of c omplex and multi -faceted social issues through different angles (Fusch et al., 2018) . 7.4.3. Focus This third and final set of limitations relates to the research focus. First, not all types of external actors are considered in this study : those not providing fi nancial or in -kind contributions, such as political leaderships and consultative fora, are excluded. Yet, they may have influenced disbursements, as suggested by findings from Chapter 6. Second, I define mental health to include mental disorders only to re flect definition of development assistance for mental health used by IHME (Chapters 4 and 5) and to ensure feasibility within the time and resource available for this research . While positive aspects and social determinants of mental health are excluded, I discuss their relevance in the empirical chapters (Chapters 3 to 6). Finally, I focus on the role of external actors in sustainable mental health financing, excluding domestic actors and their contributions. However, I recognise the importance of partners hips with domestic actors to ensure impact beyond funded activities (Chapters 3 to 6) and the centrality of recipient countries for sustainable mental health financing by positioning them at the centre of this thesis : they are at the centre of the new typo logy presented in Chapter 3 and the analytical 224 model used in Chapter 5, and amongst factors shaping organisational decisions in the analytical framework outlined in Chapter 6. 7.5. Future research directions Building on this thesis , in this section I outline t hree main research directions for studying external actors investing in mental health in LMICs. Empirical chapters (Chapters 3 to 6) present detailed research recommendations. First, further research is needed to understand the role of external actors inv esting in mental health in LMICs , especially outside the public sector. The new typology presented in Chapter 3 could be used to map external actors for different regions, settings (e.g. development versus humanitarian), and mental disorders (e.g. common versus severe mental disorders). In particular, it could be interesting to explore external actors investing in mental health in singl e LMICs in order to reveal and compare country -specific ecosystems. Similarly, the analytical framework proposed in Chapter 6 could guide comprehensive and systematic assessment of external organisations' investments in mental health in LMICs through quali tative studies for different regions, settings, and mental disorders. The two research tools (new typology and analytical framework) could be used in both cross -sectional and longitudinal qualitative studies, allowing comparisons across organisations and o ver time. They could ensure consistency and comparability across studies, hence facilitating recognition of overall trends through qualitative meta - analyses (Levitt, 2018) . Within this research stream, it could be worth exploring relationships across exter nal actors (Han et al., 2018) and between external and domestic actors more closely, in order to inform discussion on partnerships for development and sustainability of investments. In addition, while the study of political leaderships and consultative for a is beyond the scope of this research , their analysis through case studies could shed a light on their influence on investments in mental health in LMICs . A second avenue for research could seek to strengthen evidence on allocation of external actors' i nvestments in mental health in LMICs . To support policy planning and financing, quantitative studies could build on existing literature in health (Ottersen et al., 2018) to explore allocation formulae, especially for development assistance for mental healt h. To 225 ensure sustainability of investments beyond funded activities, domestic mental health capacity and financing should be integrated in allocation formulae or in considerations to their implementation. Qualitative studies could investigate the process u sed by external actors to allocate resources to mental health in LMICs , focusing on single external organisations or organisation types (e.g. bilateral versus multilateral governmental organisations), different settings, and diverse mental disorders. Compa rative studies could shed a light on overall trends, and successful and unsuccessful strategies. To identify successful financing mechanisms and strategies, qualitative and quantitative studies could evaluate the impact of external actors' investments for mental health in LMICs , in terms of acceptability, effectiveness, cost -effectiveness, affordability and potential harm. A third and final stream of research could scrutinise ethical issues related to external investments in mental health in LMICs . Quantit ative studies could illuminate equity and sustainability of external investments, in particular vis -\u00e0-vis their volatility and fungibility (Lu et al., 2010) . Qualitative studies could investigate ethical issues across different organisation groups and acro ss for -profit and not -for-profit arms of the same organisation, in particular regarding the financialisation of global mental health. This could advance knowledge on ethical investments for mental health in LMICs , potentially contributing to address existi ng tensions and to unlock resources from all external actors. Methods used and tools developed during this research could be used to study domestic actors investing in mental health in LMICs . For instance, domestic actors could be mapped adapting the new typology presented in Chapter 3, their investments assessed using the analytical framework proposed in Chapter 6, and resource allocation investigated using econometric methods as in Chapter 5. The synergistic development of evidence on both external and d omestic actors is crucial to advance sustainable mental health financing in LMICs . 7.6. Final reflections This research has been a considerable learning journey. I started with a training in clinical psychology and health policy, and 10 years of experience in the field of global mental 226 health policy and practice. Over the last four years I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge and skills in both quantitative and qualitative research. I strengthened my knowledge in econometrics and Stata coding skills, especially in macro -economic: the understanding of country -level variables, the creation of ad -hoc time series cross - sectional datasets, trend analyses and visualisation, regression analyses using different econometric models and estimation techniques. Extensive training in qualitative research allowed me to enhance my knowledge in qualitative data and methods (e.g. themati c analysis, process tracing, social network analysis), and NVivo skills. In addition, training in research ethics, safety, and data management permitted me to design and conduct research at the highest possible standards. Looking ahead, my research has gen erated more questions and more data (especially from the interviews) that I plan to explore and analyse in the future. 227 References Abdulmalik, J., Fadahunsi, W., Kola, L., Nwefoh, E., Minas, H., Eaton, J. and O.

Appendix Appendix Highly Commended Festival Prize at the LSE Fes tival Research Competition 2020 ................................ ................................ ................................ .......... 338 263 Appendix 2. 1: Datasets for development assistance for mental health My preliminary mapping of time series cross -sectional datasets (see Section 2.3) allowed the identif ication of four avail able datasets for tracking development assistance for mental health (DAMH): the development assistance for health dataset produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) , the Harvard dataset on DA MH, aid activities data base from the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) of the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD), and the Financi al Tracking Service (FTS) database of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( UN OCHA). The FTS database reports humanitarian contributions (commitments and disbursements) by over 100 government donors, United Nations ( UN) agencies, UN -administered funds, civil society organisations, and private donors (UN OCHA, 2017) . Open -access d ata are available from 1980 and updated regularly . One study (Tol et al., 2011) identifies mental health activities in humanitarian settings between 2007 and 2009 , searching the FTS and CRS databases using key words (mental health, psychosocial, psychological ) in the project name or description . I discarded the FTS database due to its narrow focus on humanitarian assistance. The CRS database provides development and humanitarian contributions (commitments and disbursements) by 50 government donors, multilateral organisations, and private foundations (OECD, 2019) . Publicly available, d ata are a vailable from 1973 and updated or revised every three months . The CRS database includes multiple sectors: health, education, government and civil services, other social infrastructures and services, and humanitarian aid . Over the last decade, it has been u sed to create ad hoc datasets tracking development assistance for mental health through searches with mental health - related key words in project name s or description s (Charlson et al., 2017; Gilbert et al., 2015; Liese et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2018; Tol et al., 2011 ; Turner et al., 2017 ). I discarded this database due to feasibility considerations : the process of identification of mental health activities would have required substantial time and human and financial resourc es. 264 The Harvard dataset uses the CRS database to identify DAMH disbursed between 2007 and 2013 (Gilbert et al., 2015) . It reports disaggregated data on DA MH funded by 55 donors in 157 countries between 2007 and 201 3. Donors include bilateral organisations, multilateral organisations, private organisations, and global health initiatives. DAMH is defined to include contributions to projects whose prim ary purpose is to promote mental health or to prev ent and /or treat mental disorders , substance use disorders, dementia, and self-harm. The Harvard dataset includes all sectors represented in the CRS database . Mental health a ctivitie s are identified searching for mental health -related key words in 11 languages (English, French, German, Span ish, Danish, Finnish, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish) in project title s. Final DAMH estimates are upper bound values , includ ing the full amount disbursed to identified projects, even when these projects involve other activities not related to mental healt h. Region al, global and unspecified funding are reallocated to each country based on the country's share in total DAMH during the year. The Harvard dataset is not regularly updated and permission from Harvard Universit y needs to be obtained prior to use. The IHME dataset offers semi -aggregated data on development assistance for health (including mental health) disbursed in 172 countries between 1990 and 2017 (IHME, 2018a) . It reports resource flows from funding sources (governments, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, corporate donations, other private sector contributions, debt repayment, other ), through channel organisations, defined as intermediary organisations disbursing funding to implementing institutions providing support in low - and middle - income countries ( bilateral organisations, multilateral organisations, multilateral development finance institutions, foundations, nongovernmental organisations, global health initiatives ) (see Supplement 4.1) . The IHME dataset combines data from numerous sources : CRS database, financial reports, audited financial statements, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Report of Voluntary Agencies, Foundation Center's grant database, Bill & Melinda Gates Fo undation online grant database, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 990 tax forms, and personal correspondences (IHME, 2018b). DAMH is defined as contributions primarily intended for mental health, including mental disorders, substance use disorders, dementia , self -harm, and some neurological 265 conditions (epilepsy, headache disorders, Parkinson's disease) . Mental health activities are identified in project titles and descriptions using mental health -related key words in nine languages (English , Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, German, Norwegian, Swedish ). DAMH values for projects with more than one focus area are estimate d by divid ing the total amount across health focus areas proportiona tely to the number of key words present in the project's title and description . While r egional DAMH is reallocated equally to each country in the specified region s, global and unspecified funding are excluded from country estimates . Annually updated , the publicly available dataset omits some values (i.e. values greater than US$0 but less than US$500, or less than US$0 and greater than -US$500) , yet the complete dataset is available under request . After comparing the characteristics of the Harvard and IHME datasets (see Appendix Table 2.1.1) and obtaining further details from Harvard University and IHME, I considered their advantages and disadvantages vis-\u00e0-vis this study (see Appendix Table 2.1.2) . Finally, I selected the IHME dataset due to accessibility, feasibility , suitability for analyses , and sustain ability (see Appendix Table 2.1.2) . The IHME dataset is easily accessible as publicly available . The availability of pre -identified DAMH allows the completion of my study within time and resources constraints. The dataset characteristics (structure, breadt h, scope, time coverage) make it suitable for the regression analyses planned in this study . Finally, annual updates ensure the sustainability of the IHME dataset: analyses can be replicate d in the future, favouring potential comparisons and learning.

With most LMIC governments already under considerable economic pressure, external funding is urgently needed. In line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recommend the mobilisation of additional external funding from a wide range of sources (e.g. development assistance, foreign direct investments, remittances) while assuring sustainability through local ownership and a gradual increase in domestic resources. DFIs: development financial institutions. GOs: governmental organisations. SMEs: small and medium enterprises.Who are the key externa l actors in global mental health? This research and policy tool typology of external actors adapted for the SDG-era provides a framework for policy planning and research in sustainable development in global mental health and global health. It is for researchers, policy makers, funders and investors, advocates, people with mental disorders and their families and carers. 335 Governm ental organisations in high-and middle-income countries provide goods and services in LMICs, in agreement with recipient country governments. Bilateral governmental organisations in agreement with recipient countries are funded by just one state and include aid agencies (e.g. United States Agency for International Development, USAID) and other governmental agencies investing in development (e.g. ministries of foreign affairs or their equivalents, research councils). Multilateral governmental organisations are funded and composed by multiple states at the regional (e.g. European Com mission), international (e.g. Colom bo Plan), or global level (e.g. World Health Organization). Develop ment finance institutions (DFIs) are organisations offering financial products (e.g. loans) in contexts whe re commercial banks wo uld not usually invest, due to what might be perceived to be high political, socio-econom ic or environm ental risks. Bilateral DFIs are funded by just one state and provide financial products usually at a commercial rate (e.g. United States Overseas P rivate Investment Corporation, OPIC). Multilateral DFIs provide financial products usually at facilitated rates and are funded by multiple states, at the regional (e.g. African Development Bank), international (e.g. Islamic Development Bank) or global level (e.g. World Bank).PUBLIC SECTOR Corporations a nd small and medium enterprises are for-profit organisations providing goods and services through foreign investments and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Foreign investments include foreign direct investments (FDIs), foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) and commercial loans. FPIs are foreign indirect investments made by corporations, financial institutions and private investors using both equity (e.g. stocks) and debt instruments (e.g. bonds). FDIs are substantial physi cal investments and purchases usually m ade by corporations in another country. CSR includes financial and in-kind contributions, in both products and human resources. Found ations include non-profit organisations either created and mainly funded by private-sector companies (e.g. Microsoft Philanthropies) or created by wealt hy individuals and their families and funded through gifts of shares or endowments (e.g. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). They are often grant-making entities. Individual household s contribute through donat ions, including financial and in kind- contributions in goods or services, and private foreign investments. A small number of individuals are described as 'high-net-worth': individuals with financial assets greater than US$1 million. A different and larger group of individuals are diaspora movements, including almost three-quarters (186 million) of international migrants coming from LMICs.PRIVATE SECTOR Third sector org anisations constitute the most heterogeneous group of non-profit organisations providing goods and services. Among others, this group includes non- governmental organisations (e.g. BasicNeeds), professional associations (e.g. World Psychiatric Association) and research centres (e.g. universities).THIRD SECTOR Multi-sector partnership s are a heterogeneous group of organisations arising from arrangements between actors from two or more sectors aimed to leverage additional funding for global health, usually for specific conditions. Amongst others, this group include global health initiatives (e.g. Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) and innovation funds (e.g. Dementia Discovery Fund).MULTISECTOR PARTNERSHIPS This research and policy tool is adapted from and should be cited as: Iemmi V.
