Wallis, MD, Jennifer L. Chin, MD, Denise K. C. Sur, MD, and Michael Y. Lee, MD Background: Pregnancy is a high-risk indication for influenza vaccination; however, rates of vaccination fall short of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended guidelines. Methods: Brief educational sessions with family physicians and obstetricians were undertaken in the fall of 2002. Notes reading \"Think Flu Vaccine\" were placed on active obstetric charts during the study period. Charts were reviewed at the end of influenza season for documentation of discussion or admin-istration of influenza vaccination. Charts for the same period during the previous 2 years were also re-viewed for baseline. Results: Baseline rates of vaccination or discussion averaged 1.5% over the 2000 -2002 influenza seasons. After intervention, the 2002-2003 rate of vaccination or discussion demonstrated an almost15-fold increase to 21.9%. This was greater in family practices (3.2% to 44.9%) versus obstetric prac-tices (1.2% to (1.1% to 16%) practices (all valueswere P<.001). Conclusions: Provider education with simple chart prompts seems an effective way to increase rates of physician discussion of influenza vaccination with pregnant women. The increased rates seen in thisstudy across various practice settings also suggest that inclusion of influenza vaccination on standard-ized prenatal care flowsheets may achieve similar goals with less individualized effort and should beconsidered. (J Am Board Fam Med 2006;19:345-9.) Influenza epidemics are a major health concern in the United States, affecting 10% to 20% of thegeneral population and causing signicant morbid-ity and mortality each year. 1The influenza vaccine is the best available means to reduce the morbidityand mortality associated with the virus, with a po-tential 90% effectiveness in preventing disease inhealthy adults under age 65 and up to 60% inpreventing hospitalization. 2The Advisory Com - mittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) currently (July 2005) recommends vaccinat- ing high-risk populations who may have an in-creased morbidity or mortality from complicationsof influenza (see Table 1), including women whowill be pregnant during the influenza season. 3 Although the vaccine is specically recom- mended during pregnancy, many physicians havehistorically advocated avoidance of vaccinationduring the rst trimester. 4This was not due to reported adverse effects, but rather because rou-tinely administering any vaccine during this timemay have prompted spurious anecdotal associationbetween vaccination and either spontaneous abor-tion or birth defects. However, the ACIP guide-lines have recently been updated to specicallystate that influenza vaccination in any trimester isrecommended. 3The current recommendation is to provide pregnant women with vaccination in thefall, ideally during the months of October and No-vember, as there seems to be at least a 2 weekperiod to reach peak immunologic response to thevaccine. 5 Despite the decrease in morbidity and mortality, multiple obstacles may deter influenza vaccinationduring pregnancy.

Downloaded from that obstacles may include lack of education of both patients and physicians, oversight by the provider,lack of influenza vaccine supply, and nancial costand physician compensation. 6There is a lack of signicant research in the efcacy of interventionsto improve vaccination rates in these women. Onepotential intervention is provider prompting dur-ing patient visits to increase vaccination rates andreduce missed opportunities. 7Determining effec - tive interventions is important in increasing thevaccination rate in this high-risk population. Materials and Methods This prospective, interventional, multisite trial wasdesigned to evaluate the efcacy of chart remindersand physician education as interventions to im-prove rates of physician discussion of influenza vac-cine with pregnant women in a suburban commu-nity. Six physician practices with obstetricalprivileges at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center(Santa Monica, CA) were enrolled in the study.The study population comprised one group obstet-ric practice, 2 solo private obstetric practices, onegroup family medicine practice, and 2 small (singleprovider) family medicine practices. Applicationwas submitted, and study was declared exempt fromInstitutional Review Board approval. Early in thefall of 2002, each participating physician received ashort educational session regarding the indications,contraindications, and background information forthe influenza vaccine. Educational sessions weredesigned to increase knowledge of the most recentACIP recommendations. These sessions were ap-proximately 5 minutes in length, with a presenta-tion and discussion reviewing the indications, contra-indications, and side effect prole of the vaccine witheach provider. Reminder notes reading \"Think FluVaccine\" were then placed on the charts of all currentobstetric patients, and staff were instructed to dolikewise for all new obstetric patients. Late in the spring of 2003, the charts of obstetric patients with estimated dates of delivery between 1December 2000 and 31 August 2003 were system-atically reviewed. To ensure that a physician-pa-tient relationship had been established and therewas opportunity to vaccinate the patient if indi-cated, patients with fewer than 3 documented visitswere excluded. Because the peak of influenza sea-son has historically occurred between the monthsof December and March, 3,4patients for whom in - fluenza vaccine was not indicated (estimated datesof delivery from September 1 through November30) were also excluded from the study. In addition,patients with no documented visits after 14 weeks'gestation were excluded, due to theoretical con-cerns surrounding rst trimester vaccination thathave since been addressed with the most recentACIP recommendations. 3 The focus of this study was on improving and monitoring provider compliance with CDC guide-lines to advise vaccination in pregnant women. Assuch, chart review focused on whether discussion ofprenatal influenza vaccination was documented bythe provider. Documentation of vaccine adminis-tration, instruction to obtain vaccine from anotherphysician, or patient refusal of vaccination eachdemonstrated that the provider remembered toconsider vaccination in accordance with CDC rec-ommendations and thus were grouped together foranalysis.Table 1.

Downloaded from Documentation of vaccination advisement from 2000 through 2003 was collected systematically from each practice. These data were then statisti-cally analyzed to determine the efcacy of the ed-ucational and reminder intervention describedabove. All Pvalues were calculated by /H9273 2statistical analysis, except in the 2 individual family practiceswhere the two-tailed Fisher's exact test was useddue to their small sample size. Results A total of 2084 charts met inclusion criteria. Ofthese, 226 (10.8%) were from family medicinepractices and 1858 (89.2%) were from obstetricpractices. Private, solo practices accounted for 348(16.7%), whereas 1736 (83.3%) were from grouppractices.Baseline rates of influenza vaccination discussion among this study population averaged 1.5% over the 2000 -2001 and the 2001-2002 influenza sea-sons. After the intervention of physician educationand systematic reminders as described above, the2002-2003 rate of vaccination discussion demon-strated an almost 15-fold increase to 21.9% ( P/H11021 .001; Table 2). The percentage of patients with whom immuni- zation was discussed and documented rose from3.2% to 44.9% among family practices and from1.2% to 19.4% in obstetric practices (Figure 1).Similarly, immunization discussion rose from3.3% to 46.7% in small practices, and from 1.1%to 16% in large practices. Each of these differ-ences was statistically signicant with values ofP/H11021.001.Table 2.

Downloaded from Discussion Women who are pregnant during the influenza season are classied by the CDC as high risk fordeveloping complications of influenza infection.For health care providers, the primary resource toprevent these complications is the influenza vac-cine. Due to many factors, vaccination rates in thishigh-risk group unfortunately remain extremelylow. 8 -10The importance and safety prole of in - fluenza vaccination during pregnancy has sincebeen further emphasized by the more recent rec-ommendations of the ACIP, 3which call for influ - enza vaccination in all women who will be pregnantduring flu season, rather than only those who willbe in their second or third trimesters during thistime. 11 Especially in an era of limited nancial resources and overwhelming time constraints, interventionsthat are of low cost and require little labor toimplement are intuitively the most desirable. Thisstudy demonstrates that education and chart re-minders are an effective way to increase patient-physician discussion of the benets of influenzavaccination among pregnant women. The percent-age of women who were advised to be immunizedafter the intervention rose 15-fold among familyphysicians and 18-fold among obstetricians to44.9% and 19.4%, respectively. Although the fold increase was higher among obstetricians, the actualpercentage of increase was greater among familyphysicians (41.7% vs 18.2%). Given that discussionof immunization was documented in nearly half oftheir patients, compared with less than 1/5th ofobstetricians' patients, the intervention had greatersuccess in family physicians' ofces. Similarly, theintervention was more effective in small practicesthan large ones, as evidenced by a 43.4% differenceversus a 14.8% increase in large groups. Most im-portantly, however, these interventions proved tobe highly effective in increasing the rates of discus-sion of influenza vaccination in all studied practicesettings: Pvalues for comparisons were highly sig- nicant for both family medicine and obstetricpractices, as well as in both small individual andlarge group practices. Although this intervention did improve rates of vaccination discussion between patient and pro-vider, the overall rates still remained low. Otherfactors still may play a role in these low immuni-zation discussion rates, and more effective means ofphysician education than those used in this study may further increase compliance with ACIP rec-ommendations. This study does strongly suggest,however, that signicant obstacles in vaccinatingthis population may include oversight by the pro-vider and/or lack of education regarding the vac-cine indications. More importantly, however, itdemonstrates that these obstacles are easily sur-mountable with a simple intervention. One limitation of this study is the presence of confounding factors that may affect vaccinationrates, such as cost or supply of vaccines in theofce, marketing, and awareness and desire of thegeneral public regarding the influenza vaccine. Al-though 2 years of data were recorded from eachofce to determine the practice's baseline vacci-nation rates, these variables cannot be held con-stant and thus may have shifted coincidentallywith the intervention being evaluated as no con-current control group was studied. Errors in doc-umentation may represent another limitation ofthis study. Influenza is a common illness with signicant morbidity and mortality, for which a widely avail-able, highly effective, and cost-conscious method ofprevention has been developed. Pregnancy repre-sents both a time of regularly scheduled interfacewith the medical community and a time of in-creased vulnerability to the disease. Optimizing thepreventive benets of these encounters should in-volve increasing compliance with CDC guidelinesfor immunization. This study demonstrates thatchart reminders are a simple but effective way toincrease vaccine discussion rates and require mini-mal labor and cost. Furthermore, it suggests thatinclusion of influenza vaccination status onto stan-dardized prenatal care flowsheets may achieve thesame goals with less cost or individualized effortand should, therefore, be considered.
