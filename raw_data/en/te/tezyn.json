They also oversee the dissemination of related educational materials and promote the utilization of orthopaedic value products by the Academy's lea dership and its members. Council on Research and Quality The Council on Research and Quality promotes ethically and scientifically sound clinical and translational research to sustai n patient care in musculoskeletal disorders. The Council also serves as the primary resource for educating its members, the public, and public policy makers regarding evidenced -based medical practice, orthopaedic devices and biologics, regulatory pathways and standards development, patient safety, and other related important research and quality areas. The Council is comprised of the chairs of the committees on Devices, Biologics, and Technology, Patient Safety, Research Development, U.S. and chair and section leaders of the Evidence Based Quality and Value committee. A lso, on the Council are the second vice -president, three members at large, and representatives of the Diversity Advisory Board, Women's Health Issues Advisory Board, Board of Specialty Societies (BOS), Board of Councilors (BOC), Communications Cabinet, Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS), Or thopedic Research and Education Foundation (OREF). Board of Directors The 17 -member Board of Directors manage the affairs of the AAOS, set policy, and oversee the Strategic Plan Review Organizations Review of the clinical practice guideline is completed by interested external organ izations. The AAOS solicits reviewers for each clinical practice guideline. They consist of experts in the topic area and represent professional societies other than AAOS. Review organizatio ns are nominated by the clinical practice guideline development gr oup at the introductory meeting. Review responses are available on www.aaos.org/quality.
