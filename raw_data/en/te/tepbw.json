When crystals are placed in a room, they will automatically charge that area with energy. They will also absorb and ionize that energy in the area, which is negative. The clearing, focusing, radiating beauty aspects of a crystal, work regardless if someone is aware of these traits or not. These are the amazing elements of a crystal's power. To disperse this energy outward is one of its true gifts. It is even more astonishing when we are aware of it! Choosing a place for your crystals can be done by using your instincts, placing them in your meditation room, alter or sacred space, or placing them in a room that you can benefit from their metaphysical properties. Cleansing your crystals can be done by placing them into a bowl of luke warm water. For some crystals you can add a teaspoon of sea salt. Make sure the salt is dissolved, then place your crystals in the water for twenty four hours. For other crystals you can add flower petals to the water. Other crystals can be placed in a bowl of hematite or clear quartz or on a large crystal cluster to charge and energies them again. Find more about cleansing your crystals here.
