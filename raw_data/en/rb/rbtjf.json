I have ordered this powder for third time now. I really love the smell kof this hairwash. But this time around i found it smells completely different. I think you guys have given me some other powder. Probably the Yuva hairwash. Hence was really disaapointed Good. Similar to the traditional home made ones. I have tried everything for frizz free hair. At last I found the perfect product. I have super frizzy hair but finally I got the perfect product. Literally big fan of this mask. I used your shampoo and it created so much lather and cleaned my scalp without over drying it. Of course I used it with your hair mask. Thank you for creating this wonderful product. Keep going like this. I bought this product approximately two weeks back and wanted to give my review post using it. I have greys and once in 2 months I need to apply chemical colour. I was always looking for an organic option. I used this product exactly 14 days back. What I loved was the ease of application, time for which it needs to be kept and the results ofcourse. I have happy to inform that after two weeks the colour is still there. I think it will last me for another week to two weeks. Ofcourse i don't apply shampoos and only use kesashuddhi yuva. I loved this oil. While I am huge fan of all Kalyashastra products, but I must especially complement them that they have started working on fragrances despite maintaining the quality. This is like a magic potion. Illuminates the skin and reduces marks and blemishes in the very first use.
