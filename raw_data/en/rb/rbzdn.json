I was recently reading the description of a massage on a spa menu online. It read \"relaxes your mind,body, soul and spirit\" \"Well that sounds dumb\" I thought, \" just pick one, it's either spirit or soul but not both.\" Then I began to remember all of the descriptions about massage and notices a pattern including adding the word spirit or soul. Even I've written some articles about massage being a spiritual experience not because it was trending because I truly believe that positive touch therapy benefits a person on multiple levels. Overall, when did the concept of soul/spirit tie into mind body therapies in America? Why has it become so popular? Before 2008 I wouldn't classify any exercise class or doctor visit including a mention of the word spirit. By the way, just for clarification I'll be using the words spirit and soul interchangeably here. However for definition the spirit is the essence of a human being; that other worldly part of ourselves that is immortal and is very much tied to our physical bodies. But none ever thought much about it when it came to health until the wellness movement came about and I believe largely influence by eastern culture of the world. In Chinese Medicine it is known that the manifestations of some diseases are brought by emotions. They understand that emotional conditions such as sadness,depression,anxiety etc. could show up in the body in unhealthy ways. While in the west, mental health and physical health were not normally treated together. In the east however the human being was treated holistically, the way you lived your life, the stresses of a negative home life for example could and would eventually affect your health. In the west life was compartmentalized. For Americans health was clear cut, black and white, grey was usually not welcomed. But with the introduction of spiritual practices into our exercise came the concept of treating the spirit as well. Eventually wellness became not only about preventive health habits (brushing your teeth daily, taking vitamins etc.) but it became about peering into the soul. What was going inside? What was your state of mind? What was your relationship with God? All of a sudden there was a cultural shift in health that encompass you guessed it, the spirit. This was new for a lot of people especially those that I remember in my childhood that grew up watching Jane Fonda and her aerobics workouts, where the priority was looking good. In the 1980's Americas saved the soul talk for church or other spiritual practices. So, is it good that the soul has been tied to healthcare? It's definitely a new phenomenon. But in truth , the concept of the soul and mindset is now attached to almost everything: business, interior decor, finances (e.g the minimalist lifestyle). The importance of living a meaningful life certainly makes us think on a deeper level. But how does that affect to healthcare? After twenty years of practicing massage I have only recently witnessed physicians referring patients for massage, clean eating and meditation. Since the mid to late 2000's the concept has taken a lot of loops and turns. Some practices I'm just not crazy about but overall I believe it to be a positive thing because humans are complex creatures. You can't simply treat a person well and for the long term without guiding them to change their behavior of why they are sick to begin with.
