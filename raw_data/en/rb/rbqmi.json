It dates back 4,000 years, and focuses on treating the cause of disease and pain rather than the symptoms. Balancing the Qi We focus on balancing your Qi. Someone with imbalanced vital energy can start to develop a dysfunction of an organ system. If it is not treated, it will turn into a disease. We integrate the four components of TCM which are chiropractic and massage, herbology, and Qi Gong (mind and body) healing. How can acupuncture help?
