Enregistri par le Pakistan le 12 mai 1952. 4 United Nations -Treaty Series 1952 No. 1733. AGREEMENT, BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA. SIGNED AT NEW DELHI, ON 8 APRIL 1950 A. The Governments of India and Pakistan solemnly agree that each shall ensure to the Minorities throughout its territory, complete equality of citizen- ship, irrespective of religion, a full sense of security in respect of life, culture, property and personal honour, freedom of movement within each country and freedom of occupation, speech and worship, subject to law and morality. Mem- bers of the minorities shall have equal opportunity with members of the majority community to participate in the public life of their country, to hold political or other office, and to serve in their country's civil and armed forces. Both Govern- ments declare these rights to be fundamental and undertake to enforce them effectively. The Prime Minister of India has drawn attention to the fact that these rights are guaranteed to all minorities in India by its Constitution. The Prime Minister of Pakistan has pointed out that similar provision exists in the Objectives Resolution adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. It is the policy of both Governments that the enjoyment of these democratic rights shall be assured to all their nationals without distinction. Both Governments wish to emphasise that the allegiance and loyalty of the minorities is to the State of which they are citizens, and that it is to the Govern- ment of their own State that they should look for the redress of their grievances. B. In respect of migrants from East Bengal, West Bengal, Assam and Tripura, where communal disturbances have recently occurred, it is agreed between the two Governments: (i) That there shall be freedom of movement and protection in transit. (ii) That there shall be freedom to remove as much of his moveable personal effects and household goods as a migrant may wish to take with him. Moveable property shall include personal jewellery. The maximum cash allowed to each adult migrant will be Rs. 150/- and to each migrant child Rs. 75/-. (iii) That a migrant may deposit such of his personal jewellery or cash as he does not wish to take with him with a Bank. A proper receipt shall be furnished to him by the Bank for cash or jewellery thus deposited and facilities Came into force on 8 April 1950 by signature. 1952 Nations Unies -Recuei des Traitis 5 [TRADUCTION L'INDE.

(v) Rights of ownership in or occupancy of the immoveable property of a migrant shall not be disturbed. If, during his absence, such property is occupied by another person, it shall be returned to him, provided that he comes back by the 31st December 1950. Where the migrant was a cultivating owner or tenant, the land shall be restored to him, provided that he returns not later than the 31st December, 1950. In exceptional cases, if a Government considers that a migrant's immoveable property cannot be returned to him, the matter shall be referred to the appropriate Minority Commission for advice. Where restoration of immoveable property to the migrant who returns within the specified period is found not possible the Government concerned shall take steps to rehabilitate him. (vi) That in the case of a migrant who decides not to return, ownership of all his immoveable property shall continue to vest in him and he shall have unrestricted right to dispose of it by sale, by exchange with an evacuee in the other country, or otherwise. A Committee consisting of three representatives of #he minority and presided over by a representative of Government shall act as trustees of the owner. The Committee shall be empowered to recover rent for such immoveable property according to law. The Governments of East Bengal, West Bengal, Assam and Tripura shall enact the necessary legislation to set up these Committees. The Provincial or State Government, as the case may be, will instruct the District or other appropriate authority to give all possible assistance for the discharge of the Committee's functions. The provisions of this sub-paragraph shall also apply to migrants who may have left East Bengal for any part of India, or West Bengal, Assam or Tripura for any part of Pakistan, prior to the recent disturbances but after the 15th August, 1947. The arrangement in this sub-paragraph will apply also to migrants who have left Bihar for East Bengal owing to communal disturbances or fear thereof.

It was agreed that in areas where communal incidents are of frequent occurrence influential persons, particularly those belonging to the majority community should be appointed as Special Constables and charged with responsibility for the prevention of such incidents, in particular, abduction or molestation of, or insults to, women and for the apprehension of offenders. 5. It was agreed that an area where a serious communal disturbance takes place, or where there is a succession of incidents involving oppression or harassment of the minorities, and where the inhabitants have either themselves been responsible for the crimes or have not been diligent in preventing the commission of such crimes, should be penalised by the levy of a collective fine or the imposition of a Punitive Police Force. 6. It was agreed that a deterrent sentence should be awarded on an offender convicted of communal crime, particularly in cases involving offences against women. II.

III. DELINQUENT GOVERNMENT OFFICERS 1. Attention of Officers of both Governments should be drawn to the provisions of para. 7 of the Delhi Agreement of December, 1948. 2. It was agreed that disciplinary action should be taken against officers who are found to be acting against the spirit of the Agreement or in any way fail to implement it, or who directly or indirectly lend support to persons who are against the agreement. 3.

Every attempt will also be made to de-requisition such requisitioned houses as are periodically visited by their owners and for the rest of the year remain in the occupation of their employees. As far as practicable, the same principle should apply to houses requisitioned before the disturbances; (b) That in future, houses which are occupied by the owners or their relations or by their tenants will not be requisitioned, provided, however, that houses which are occupied in a bona fide manner by the members of the minority community may be requisitioned in future only for urgent governmental requirements, and orders of requi- sition should be issued only after a careful examination of the case by a responsible Government officer of high status; (Note: Urgent governmental requirements shall not include finding accommodation for individual refugee families but may include the establishment of refugee camps by Government.)

(b) In the event of the migrant not returning, such lands shall not be re-allocated to third parties before the 31st March, 1951. (c) Where according to these arrangements, the entire holding, along with the homestead, cannot be restored to the migrant, he shall be provided with alternative accommodation. (d) In all such cases the over-riding consideration should be the restoration of all the immovable property of the migrant to him at the earliest possible date. 2. As regards lands under the Aman crop, it shall be open to the migrant to return at any time after the 15th of January, 1951, and before the 31st March, 1951, when such lands shall be restored to him on return. 3. Vacant homesteads and lands on which no crops have so far been grown shall not be allotted to third parties.

V.: JURISDICTION OF TRUST COMMITTEES With regard to the difference of opinion which has arisen between East Bengal and West Bengal as' to whether the Trust Committees under Clause (VI), Section B of the Agreement, could'assume management of the property of a migrant who applies in writing asking for such arrangement without formally declaring his intention not to return, it was decided that the two Central Ministers will give their final decision in the matter on return to Calcutta. VI. CUSTOMS 1. It was agreed that Customs Officers on both sides should be asked to give liberal interpretation to the term \" migrant \" and that elaborate examination of a traveller to ascertain whether he .is.a migrant or not should be avoided. 2.

Accordingly, the Signatory States hereby agree to establish a system of free trade, to be extended progressively, eliminating the undermentioned customs duties, taxes and requirements between their territories, in respect of the products of both countries listed in the attached schedule, which forms Annex \" A \" of this Treaty.2 'Came into force on 17 May 1952 by the exchange of the instruments of ratification at Guate- mala, in accordance with article XXII. 2 See p. 151 of this volume. 134 :United Nations -Treaty Series 1952 En consecuencia, los o que cobren en raz6n Nations Unies -Recuei des Traites 135 As a consequence, the natural products of and the goods manufactured in the Contracting States, shall, if included in the attached schedule, be exempt from the payment of import and export duties and of all other taxes, surcharges and fees leviable on or payable by reason of import and export, whether such duties or charges are national, municipal or of any other description and whatever the purposes to which they are applied. The exemptions mentioned in this article do.. not extend to lighterage, wharfage, storage and handling charges for merchandise, or to any other charges legally payable for harbour, storage or transport services. If any of the products or articles referred to in the annexed schedule is subject to taxes, excise duties, or to any other domestic taxation whatsoever applicable to production, sale, distribution or consumption in either of the Signatory Countries, the said country may levy the same taxes on goods of the same nature imported from the other State. Article H Goods originating in the territory of either of the Contracting States and referred to in the schedule annexed to this Treaty shall be exempt from all quantitative control measures in either State. Nevertheless, until the final purposes of this Treaty are achieved, each Signatory State may continue or adopt, as a general measure without discri- mination, quantitative control measures applicable to the goods marked with an asterisk, in the annexed schedule, the nature of. such control being specified in a marginal note against the item in the schedule. Such measures may only be taken in respect of : (a) exports, to prevent or remedy a shortage of food or other products essential to the economy of the exporting country; and (b) imports, in order to avoid serious dislocations in the general economic stability of the importing country. '; ... When either of the Signatory States proposes to take any of the measures referred to in the previous paragraph, it shall proceed in such a manner as to reduce to a minimum the adverse effects on the economy of.the other State, and also to allow within reason the completion of transactions which are pending and have been. duly substantiated. The State which adopts any of the control measures referred to above, shall duly transmit to the other Signatory State all relevant information, in .order that both States may co-ordinate their respective action. Each of the Signatory States shall endeavour to rescind whatever quantitative control measures it has adopted, as soon as the circumstances which led to the adoption of these measures permit.

Article III The schedule annexed to this Treaty may be added to, reduced or modified by agreement between the two Governments, in accordance with their respective constitutional or legislative processes, subject to the advice of the Joint Com- mission referred to below. Article IV The Signatory States, convinced of the desirability of unifying their customs tariffs, shall endeavour to ensure that, before further goods are added to the schedule annexed to this Treaty, the import duties and taxes levied by each of them on goods of the same type originating in countries other than those formerly members of the Central American Federation, shall be equalized. Article V Goods exchanged under this Treaty shall be accompanied by a customs declaration form which shall contain the declaration of origin of the goods and bear the signature or fingerprint of the exporter. This form shall be checked and verified by the customs officers of both countries, as provided in Annex \" B \" to this Treaty.'

If either of the Contracting States enters into or intends to enter into a treaty similar to this Treaty with one of the other States formerly members of the Central American Federation, it shall consult with the other signatory hereto for the purpose of considering the desirability of adjusting their mutual trade relations to the altered circumstances, or, if possible, establishing in Central America a wider zone of free trade. 1 See p. 159 of this volume.

The organization in question shall act as a private commercial firm, and shall within reason offer traders of the other country an opportunity to compete in such purchase or sales transactions. CHAPTER II INTERNATIONAL. TRANSIT Article VIII Each of the Contracting States shall maintain full freedom of transit through its territory for merchandise consigned to or originating in the other State. Such transit shall be effected without deductions, discrimination or quan- titative restrictions. In the event of congestion of freight traffic or in case of force majeure, each of the Signatory States shall arrange impartially for the movement of goods intended for the supply of its own population and for that of goods in transit to the other State. Transit traffic shall be carried over the lawful routes recognized for the purpose and in conformity with the laws and customs regulations in force in the territory of transit.

CHAPTER III EXPORT SUBSIDIES AND UNFAIR COMPETITION Article IX Neither of the Signatory States shall grant, whether directly or indirectly, export subsidies in respect of goods intended for the territory of the other State, nor shall it establish or maintain systems the result of which would be the sale of such goods for export to the other State at prices lower than those at which such goods are sold on the home market, allowance to be made for the differences in conditions and terms of sale and taxation, and for the other factors affecting price comparisons. Any practice which is employed in one of the Signatory States for the purpose of fixing or discriminating between prices and which, in the other State, leads to selling prices for a particular commodity below those which would result from the normal operation of the market in the exporting country, shall be deemed to be an indirect export subsidy. Any tax exemptions granted by either of the Signatory States for the purpose of developing the production of certain goods in its territory shall not, however, be deemed to be an export subsidy. Similarly, exemption from domestic production, sales or consumption taxes chargeable in the exporting State on goods exported to the territory of the other State shall not be deemed to be an export subsidy. Article X The export of goods from either of the Signatory States to the territory of the other State at prices lower than their normal value, in a manner which causes or is likely to cause prejudice to an industry established in the territory of the other State, or which would defer the establishment of a national industry, is a practice which constitutes unfair competition (\" dumping \") and is incompatible with the purposes of this Treaty, and hence shall be avoided by both States by all the legal means at their disposal. Goods will be deemed to have been exported at prices lower than their normal value if the price of the said goods: (a) is less than the comparable price, under normal trade conditions, of similar goods intended for consumption in the home market of the exporting country; or, N* 1740 142 United Nations -Treaty falta de alto, exportaci6n a mercancia similar, en condiciones normales de comercio; 0, 2) que el costo de producci6n de esa mercancia en el pals de origen, mis un aumento razonable gastos directos o indirectos para puentes y Nations Unies -Recuei des Traitds 143 (b) in the absence of any such price in the home market is less than 1. the highest comparable price for similar goods exported to a third country under normal trade conditions; or 2. the cost of production of those goods in the country of origin, plus a reasonable addition representing sales costs and profit. In each case allowance shall be made for existing differences affecting conditions and terms of sale and taxation and for other differences influencing the comparison between prices. Article XI In order to eliminate the effects of the direct or indirect export subsidies which may result in either of the Signatory States from the application of general, non-discriminatory measures, and in order to counteract the effects of the afore- said practices of unfair competition, the State concerned may establish com- pensatory customs duties to the amount required to cover the artificial difference in price occasioned by the said subsidies or practices, in which case the other Contracting State shall be notified in advance. CHAPTER IV TRANSPORT Article XII The Signatory States shall endeavour to contruct and maintain roads to facilitate and increase the traffic between their territories, and shall confer together concerning work relating to bridges and other connexions needed at the frontiers,. They shall also endeavour to standardize transport charges in their respective territories and the relevant -statutory provisions and regulations.. Article XIII Ships and aircraft, whether commercial or private, of either of the. Con- tracting States shall receive the same treatment at ports and -airports open to international traffic in the other State as that extended to the ships and aircraft of the latter. The same treatment shall be extended to passengers, crew and freight. Road vehicles registered in either of the Signatory States shall, in the territory of \"the other State, receive the same treatment as that extended to vehicles registered in the latter.

CHAPTER V INVESTMENTS Article XIV Each of the Contracting States shall accord fair treatment to investments of capital by nationals of the other State and shall in consequence abstain from adopting discriminatory measures capable of prejudicing any rights lawfully acquired by such nationals. Investments of capital by nationals of either of the Contracting States shall, in the territory of the other State, enjoy treatment no less favourable than that extended to the most favoured nations, as regards the right of organizing, or participating or sharing in agricultural, stock-breeding, industrial, commercial, mining or financial undertakings, and also as regards the administration or management of such undertakings. In keeping with the purposes of economic integration contemplated by this Treaty, each of the Signatory States shall endeavour, subject to the pro- visions of its Constitution, to extend the same treatment to investments of capital by nationals of the other State as that given to investments of capital by its own nationals. CHAPTER VI ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION Article XV The Signatory States hereby agree to set up a Joint Trade Commission, consisting of an equal number of representatives of each Party, which shall meet whenever it is considered desirable and in any case not less frequently than once every six months. The Commission may travel freely in either of the Contracting States in order to study the matters within its competence on the spot, and the authorities of both States shall provide it with all the information and facilities required for the fulfilment of its functions.

The unification of tariffs and customs regulations; 2. The establishment of the same fiscal regime for articles subject-to monopolies and for goods subject to production, sales or consump- tion taxes; 3. The preparation of agreements for the purpose of avoiding double taxation in the matter of direct taxes; 4. The use of the metric and decimal system in all matters relating to weights and measures; and 5. The customs union between and the general economic integration of the two countries.

Your Excellency: As a result of the conversations recently held in the city of San Salvador between officials of both Governments with reference to the immediate effects of the entry into force of the Treaty of Free Trade and Economic Integration between Guatemala and El Salvador, I have the honour to inform you of the full agreement of the Government of Guatemala to the following points: 1. The Governments of Guatemala and El Salvador will, immediately on the entry into force of the Treaty, apply all the export and import controls authorized by the said Treaty in respect of the goods identified by asterisks in the schedule contained in Annex \" A \" to the Treaty. 2. The Joint Commission referred to in article XV of the Treaty will be established immediately and give priority to the consideration of procedures likely to lead to the removal of any controls which can be dispensed with, or to the regulation of controls which cannot for the time being be removed. 3. Each Government, when applying export controls to articles the import of which is not subject to control in the other State, will bear that other State's economic interests in mind, for which purpose the two Governments will consult together by the most expeditious means whenever they consider it desirable. I have pleasure in assuring you that the Government of Guatemala hopes that the operation of the Treaty and the work of the Joint Commission will make it possible at a very early date to abolish all the aforesaid controls entirely so that the high purposes contemplated by the two Governments in concluding the Treaty may be accomplished. This communication and your communication of today's date constitute the exchange of notes referred to in article II of the Treaty of Free Trade and Economic Integration signed on 14 December 1951.

AGREEMENT' BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF ITALY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COMMON- WEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR ASSISTED MIGRATION. SIGNED AT MELBOURNE, ON 29 MARCH 1951 AN AGREEMENT made the twenty-ninth day of March one thousand nine hundred and fifty-one between the Italian Government of the one part and the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia (hereinafter referred to as \"the Commonwealth Government \") of the other part. WHEREAS the Italian Government and the Commonwealth Government, within the spirit of friendship existing between the two Countries and in the belief that the encouragement of Italian migration to Australia is of mutual interest, are willing to co-operate in order to assist suitable persons in Italy to emigrate to Australia for permanent settlement; AND WHEREAS the Italian Government and the Commonwealth Government are prepared to carry out the scheme set out in this Agreement and in the Schedule hereto (hereinafter called \" the scheme \"); Now THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH AS FOLLOWS: (1) The scheme shall operate for a period of five years commencing upon a date to be fixed between the two Governments and may be continued there- after by mutual agreement. In the event, however, of conditions arising at any time either in Italy or in Australia during the currency of the scheme which may render it advisable to terminate the scheme, either party shall give to the other six months notice of its intention to terminate the scheme, upon the expiration of which period the scheme shall cease to operate. The object of the six months notice is to enable the two Governments to discuss any proposals submitted with a view to reaching mutually satisfactory arrangements in regard thereto. Should either Government desire at any time to vary the terms and conditions of the scheme it shall give to the other notice thereof in writing setting out the desired variations, but should such variations be not accep- table to the other Government the terms and conditions of the scheme shall continue to operate until termination in the manner hereinbefore provided. (2) The scheme shall be complementary to and shall not be regarded as in any way restricting the emigration to Australia of Italian Nationals who are 1 Came into force on 1 August 1951 by an exchange of notes, in accordance with clause I of the Agreement. 1952 Nations Unies -Recuei des Traitis 189 GOVERNO AUSTRALIA PER L'EMIGRAZIONE ASSISTITA ACCORDO stipulato il 29 marzo 1951 ii Governo del Commonwealth d'Australia (definito come il Com- CONSIDERATO che Governo fra due Commonwealth accorda permessi di 190 United Nations -Treaty Series 1952 granted landing permits by the Commonwealth Government and who make their own transportation arrangements at their own expense. (3) The scheme shall apply only to Italian nationals of European descent normally resident in Italy. (4) The scheme shall apply to such classes of workers skilled and unskilled as may be specified from time to time by the Commonwealth Government, and are available in Italy for emigration to Australia. (5) The two Governments shall contribute towards the cost of passages from Italy to Australia of such persons as may have been approved by them before departure in accordance with the procedure laid down in Clauses (7) to (9) inclusive of the Schedule hereto a free grant of a portion of the cost thereof as set out in Clause (1) of the Schedule. (6) Except as hereinafter provided, the two Governments shall bear their own expenses of administering the scheme. (7) All persons selected under the scheme shall be admitted into the Com- monwealth of Australia under exemption from the provisions of the Immigration Act (1901-1949) for a period of two years and shall enter into an undertaking in writing to remain in employment approved by the Commonwealth Government for a period of two years after their arrival in Australia. During the period of this undertaking Italian migrants in all other respects will enjoy the same wages, accommodation and general conditions of employment as apply to Australian workers engaged in the same type of employment. Upon the expiration of two years from the date of arrival in Australia migrants may apply for permission to remain in Australia and such permission shall be granted subject to the provisions of Clause 12 hereof if they have behaved in a satisfactory manner during the period of exemption. They shall then be free to choose such em- ployment and such place of residence in Australia as they may desire. If a migrant who is placed in an area in which private accommodation for his depen- dants cannot be obtained, is able to secure suitable private accommodation for himself and his dependants in an area other than that in which he has been placed in employment by the Commonwealth Government, he shall be entitled to move to such private accommodation, provided that the employment he intends to follow and the area to which he proposes to transfer are first approved by the Commonwealth Government. (8) Persons eligible for selection under the scheme shall be those described in Clause (6) of the schedule. (9) The Italian authorities concerned shall, without any cost to the Com- monwealth Government, attend to recruitment, initial selection, medical No. 1741 1952 Nations Unies -Recuei des Traitds che risulteranno disponibili in Italia per l'emigrazione in allegato, i due Governi concederanno un una parte detto costo come stabilito nell'articolo del stabilito, il le stesse si impegneranno per a rimanere due Nella che emigrante per procurarsi privato 1741 192 United Nations -Treaty Series 1952 examination and documentation of applicants for emigration under the scheme and provide and operate all necessary depots for the assembly and embarkation of migrants selected under the scheme. (10) The Commonwealth Government shall, in respect of migrants selected under the scheme, accept full responsibility for their reception at approved ports of disembarkation in Australia and thereafter for their onward movement, temporary accommodation placement in employment, and after-care. In discharge of this obligation the Commonwealth Government shall carry out the functions set out in Clause (22) of the Schedule. (11) The Commonwealth Government shall provide the Italian Government with information concerning conditions of and opportunities for employment in Australia for the guidance of all prospective migrants who may desire it. No official pamphlet explaining the scheme shall be issued without the con- currence of the two Governments. (12) The Commonwealth Government shall have the right to return to Italy any migrant and/or his dependants selected under the scheme who, within five years of arrival in Australia, contravene the provisions of the Immigration Act (1901-1949) of the Commonwealth of Australia or who may otherwise prove undesirable. (13) Migrants selected under the scheme shall undertake not to depart from Australia within two years from the date of arrival unless they have repaid to the Commonwealth Government the amount of free grant contributed by the two Governments under Clause (1) of the Schedule towards their assisted passages to Australia. Repayment may be waived by agreement between the two Governments in individual cases where there are compassionate or other well founded grounds for not requiring repayment by any migrant. (14) The gross sums received on account of repayment of grants pursuant to the preceding Clause shall be shared equally by the Italian Government and the Commonwealth Government in accordance with Clause (5) of the Schedule. (15) The Italian Government shall accept responsibility for procuring the necessary transportation for migrants selected under the scheme, and shall arrange to disembark such migrants at those ports or airports in Australia nominated by the Commonwealth Government and according to schedules of departures which shall be periodically agreed upon by the two Governments. The nomination of ports or airports of disembarkation shall be communicated to the Italian Government as soon as possible and prior to date of departure of the ships or aircraft.

Should the Italian Government find it necessary at any time to charter vessels of non-Italian registry for the purpose of transporting migrants under the scheme, no such vessel shall be chartered unless the Commonwealth Government is first consulted. (16) Recognising that it may not be possible for each of them to continue contributions towards the cost of passages on the present high scale for a long period involving increasing numbers of migrants, the two Governments shall, if it becomes possible at any time to obtain international aid from any source for the settlement of Italian migrants in Australia, review the rates of contribution including those of the migrant set out in Clause (1) of the Schedule. (17) In order to assist the settlement in Australia of migrants selected under the scheme, the Italian Government shall facilitate the transfer of reasonable funds from Italy by the said migrants. The Commonwealth Government will likewise facilitate the transfer to Italy, by migrants selected under the scheme, of reasonable funds for the support of their dependent relatives or for any other justified reason. The Commonwealth Government shall ensure the unrestricted remittance to Italy of all sums due by migrants for repayment of passage money advanced to them as set out in Clause (1) of the Schedule. (18) Assistance under the scheme shall be given to intending migrants who sail from Italy to Australia pursuant to the scheme at any time within five years from the commencing date of the scheme and thereafter while the scheme continues to operate. (19) The present Agreement has been drawn up in the English and Italian languages, both texts being equally authentic. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorised by their respective Governments, have signed the present Agreement in the English and Italian languages at Melbourne on this twenty-ninth day of March one thousand nine hundred and fifty-one.

Al fine di agevolare la sistemazione in il il Governo Italiano: Giulio del BALSO Per il Governo del Commonwealth d'Australia: Harold E. HOLT N- 1741 196 United Nations -Treaty Series 1952 THE SCHEDULE (1) The Commonwealth Government shall contribute towards the cost of passages from Italy to Australia of all persons charged adult rates and who are approved by it as migrants under the scheme before their departure from Italy a sum equal to one fourth part of the passage money or twenty-five pounds English currency, whichever is the lesser, provided that the Italian Government shall contribute at least the same proportion or amount. In the case of migrants who on an age basis are required to pay less than a full adult fare the Commonwealth Government shall contribute one half or one quarter of twenty-five pounds English currency or other proportionately reduced amount where the cost of the passage is one half, one quarter or other fraction of the full passage rate. The balance of the passage costs remaining after allowing for the governmental contributions shall be borne by the migrant. Where a selected migrant is unable to provide from his own funds the amount of his contribution the Italian Government shall facilitate the granting of an advance to him under particularly favourable conditions, subject to repayment by the migrant of such advance by instal- ments within thirty months after his arrival in Australia. The general conditions governing these advances and their repayment shall be the subject of consultation between the two Governments before any advances are made to any migrant. It is understood, however, that the migrant shall be obliged to contribute an initial payment of not less than ten pounds English currency towards the cost of his passage and, if accompanied by his family, ten pounds English currency for each member for whom an adult fare is charged and five pounds English currency for each other member for whom less than adult fare is charged. In the event of selected migrants travelling to Australia by aircraft the two Governments shall contribute towards such fares amounts equal to those agreed upon for sea passages. (2) The cost of passages for migrants selected under the scheme shall be reduced to the lowest possible figure and the passage rate chargeable shall be the subject of consultation between the two Governments. (3) The Italian Government, having made the payments referred to in Clause (18) of this Schedule, shall render to the Commonwealth Government at Canberra at the end of each period of three months from the commencement of the scheme, or such other period as may be agreed upon, an account of the sums expended in that period under Clause (1) of this Schedule. On the account being passed for payment the Common- wealth Government shall pay to or to the account of the Italian Government the agreed contribution. (4) The appropriate Italian authorities shall produce to the Secretary, Department of Immigration, Canberra, or his representative, and the appropriate Australian authorities shall produce to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Rome, or its representative, any docu- ments or accounts, whether in Italy or in Australia, relating to cases in which contributions have been granted or repayments under Clause (13) of the Agreement have been received, if such documents or accounts are required to be produced to either Government for audit or other purpose. (5) In respect of grant repayments under the provisions of Clause (13) of the Agreement the Commonwealth Government shall keep a separate account of sums received on account of grant repayments, and shall render to the Italian Government No 1741 1952 Nations Unies -Recuei des Traitds 197 PIANO Commonwealth alle e inglesi con prestiti rimborsi di o di i 198 \"United Nations -Treaty Series 1952 at the end of each period of three months from the commencement of the scheme, or such other period as may be agreed upon, an account of the sums received in that period. The Commonwealth Government shall pay to or to the account of the Italian Govern- ment its share of the sums so received. (6) Persons eligible for selection under the scheme shall be: (a) Single men not less than 18 nor more than 35 years of age; (b) Single women not less than 18 nor more than 30 years of age; (c) Childless married couples, each spouse being not more than 35 years of age; (d) Family units (that is to say, man, wife and child or children), the breadwinner of which shall not be more than 45 years of age. Owing to the shortage of housing and accommodation in Australia the Commonwealth Government shall have the right to limit the intake of family units during the initial period of the Agreement but as conditions in Australia permit it will be prepared to accept increasing numbers of family units; (e) Married men proceeding to Australia in advance of their wives and children, provided that they are not more than 45 years of age and provided that their wives and children comply with the medical and other selection criteria required for entry into the Commonwealth. For this purpose the initial examination by the Italian medical authorities of such wives and children shall be accepted, provided that the Commonwealth Government reserves the right to carry out a final examination prior to sailing; (f) The wives and children of the married men referred to in sub clause (e) of this Clause, provided that at the time of embarkation they comply with the medical and other selection criteria required for entry into the Commonwealth; (g) Children not more than fourteen years of age sponsored by approved child migration organisations in Australia, which will be responsible for the care and maintenance of such child migrants; provided always that the age limits of those referred to in sub clauses (a) to (g) inclusive may be extended by the Commonwealth Government in the case of persons possessing special trade or other skills, or in other special cases. (7) The procedure for selection and grant of assistance to migrants under the scheme shall be as set out in this Clause and in Clause3 (8) and (9) of this Schedule. Application forms printed in the English and Italian languages shall be prepared by the Common- wealth Government in consultation with the Italian Government. Such forms shall be distributed by the appropriate authorities of the Italian Government to prospective migrants. On completion the forms shall be returned to the said authorities, together with character and penal certificates supplied by the Italian authorities and any documents relating to the trade proficiency of the applicant. (8) The appropriate authorities of the Italian Government shall check the application and accompanying certificates and, if satisfied that the applicant and his dependants are eligible for selection, shall arrange for them to be examined by the medical service of the Italian Government. This medical examination shall be in accordance with medical standards laid down by the Commonwealth Government particulars of which No. 1741 1952 Nations Unies -Recuei des Traitds 199 35 anni; b) 18 a 30 anni; c) coniugi senza prole, a anni di eta.

The approved Commonwealth Government Medical Form shall be filled in by the Italian Medical Service to show the results of the medical examination. Any variations which the Commonwealth Government may desire from time to time in the medical standards initially furnished or in the approved Medical Form shall be notified to the Italian Government. Applicants will not be passed by the Italian Medical Service unless they comply in all respects with the Commonwealth Government medical standards. The cost of this initial medical examination of applicants will not be a charge against the Commonwealth Government. (9) Application forms and associated certificates of the applicants considered eligible by the Italian Government shall be completed in duplicate. One copy of each shall be delivered to a Commonwealth Government representative appointed pursuant to Clause (13) of this Schedule, together with the results of the medical examination provided for in the last preceding Clause. (10) So that the Italian Government may arrange preliminary registration and initial selection of Italian workers desiring to migrate to Australia the Commonwealth Govern- ment shall supply to the Italian Government close estimates in respect of each year of the required number of workers and of their dependants, classified as far as possible according to trades and for the periods from 1st January to 30th June and from 1st July to 31st December in each year. Such estimates shall be supplied six months in advance. For the same purpose the Commonwealth Government shall also provide the Italian Government, from time to time, with general information on employment, accommoda- tion and living conditions in Australia, including minimum wage rates, hours of employ- ment, and suchj ob descriptions relating to the principal trades, as may be readily available. This information may be utilised by the Italian Government to furnish advice to appli- cants regarding settlement in Australia. (11) In addition to the provisions of the last preceding Clause the Commonwealth Government shall, not less than three months before the date on which it desires that the workers should leave Italy, lodge with the Italian Government group nominations setting out the number and types of workers required. Upon receipt of these nominations the Italian Government shall proceed with initial selection in accordance therewith. Those migrants initially selected shall be presented for final selection to a Common- wealth Government representative. If any alterations to any nomination become necessary due to labour or other conditions arising in Australia the Commonwealth Government shall promptly advise the Italian Government so that it shall cease further initial selections in respect of that particular nomination. Migrants who have been finally approved by a Commonwealth Government representative before any notification of alteration as aforesaid is given by the Commonwealth Government shall be permitted to migrate to Australia, if at the date of departure they still comply with the Common- wealth Government's selection criteria, provided that the date of their departure may, at the option of the Commonwealth Government, be temporarily deferred. (12) In order that the Italian Government may plan for the training of migrants in skills or trades which may be required to fill Australian nominations the Commonwealth No. 1741 1952 Nations Unies -Recuei il Governo del Commonwealth due periodi, rispettivamente dal 10 gennaio al 30 giugno e dal luglio al 31 d ciascun Tale tre mesi prima della condizioni sopravvenute Australia, il abbia la variazione di cui sopra, permesso di quali No 1741 202 United Nations -Treaty Series 1952 Government shall supply to the Italian Government upon request such information concerning particular occupations as both Governments shall agree to be necessary to enable such planning to be undertaken. (13) The Commonwealth Government shall have the final responsibility for deciding the suitability of each applicant for settlement in Australia and shall appoint its own representative to undertake the final examination and selection of applicants and such other duties as are specified in this Schedule. The expression \" Commonwealth Government representative \" wherever appearing in this Schedule shall mean a repre- sentative appointed pursuant to this Clause. The Italian Government shall afford every assistance and co-operation to such Commonwealth Government representatives in enabling them to assess on all grounds the suitability of applicants for settlement in Australia, and shall appoint experts to facilitate and assist them in their final examination and selection of applicants. Should the Commonwealth Government representative require further evidence as to the proficiency of skilled applicants, the basis for deter- mination of proficiency shall be the technical and individual productivity standards prevailing in respect of Australian workers of the same categories. The final medical examination shall be carried out on the basis of the documents completed by the Italian Government medical authorities, provided that the Commonwealth Government shall have the right to have applicants further examined by its own medical officers before they are finally approved. (14) The Italian Government shall arrange for Commonwealth Government representatives to receive free travel facilities to areas in Italy to be agreed upon, for the purpose of interviewing, examining and finally selecting applicants, who shall be assembled in such areas by the appropriate authorities of the Italian Government. The areas or towns in Italy in which interviews and selection will be conducted shall be decided by arrangement between the Commonwealth Government representatives and the appro- priate authorities of the Italian Government.

From records showing the mortality from plague since 1901 it can be gathered that the mortality from this disease reached peaks in the years 1905, 1907, 1910 and 1911 when the following figures were recorded: Plague deathrate per 100.000 Year Total plague ..332,301 7.09 As shown in the table inserted below, within recent times there was a marked downward trend in the mortality from plague.

I The Minister of Public Health and Social Welfare, Peru, to the Director, Regional Office of the World Health Organization for the Americas MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE Lima, Peru 14 April 1952 Dear Dr. Soper, On 1st October 1950, 1 was pleased to sign an Agreement made between the World Health Organization and the Government of Peru to support the development of a campaign against exanthematic typhus in the Andean zone of the country. You were kind enough to sign the same Agreement on 17 November 1950. It was set out in the Agreement that it would be valid until 31 December 1951. The campaign against exanthematic typhus is presently being conducted in the Departments of Cuzco and Puno and in the Callej6n de Huaylas area. Even if this campaign has had satisfactory results my Office shares the opinion of the technicians of the Ministry that there exist in the epidemiology of exanthematic typhus in Peru obscure points which do not permit precise conclusions to be reached on methods of control which should be used against said disease. In view of this situation my Office considers it necessary to prolong the Agreement on exanthematic typhus for two more years starting on the renewal date of same. Among other things, this will permit the visit of a technician to Peru to assist the physicians presently directing the campaign. This technician, conjointly with them, would solve the points yet to be determined in the epidemiology and control of the sickness, set I United Nations, Treaty Series, Vol. 104, p. 233. 2 Came into force on 5 May 1952 by the exchange of the said letters. 1952 Nations Unies -Recuei des Traitds 357 [TRADUCTION ET LE DU PRROU UN PROGRAMME NATIONAL DE LUTTE CONTRE LE TYPHUS.
