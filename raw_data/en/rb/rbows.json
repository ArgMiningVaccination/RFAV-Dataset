Leukocytes or white blood cells are formed in your bone marrow and are responsible for fighting infectious pathogens. The human body creates more than a million white blood cells every day that identify the different pathogens out there and get ready to fight it. If you experience any inflammation, it means that the white blood cells in your body are working hard to get rid of the infection. When you experience bouts of cold often, it could be an indication of low white blood cell count in the body. Don't worry, we have got you covered. In this article, we take a look at the different types of white blood cells in your body and a few home remedies to help you increase the white blood count. Scroll down for more information on how to increase white blood cells! Did You Know? The number of leukocytes in the blood is an indicator of a disease. Hence, the white blood cell count is an important component of the complete blood count. In This Article What Are The White Blood Cell Counts? - Average Normal Range Of WBCs - 3,500-10,500 white blood cells per microliter of blood. - Low WBC Count - Less than 4,500 white blood cells per microliter of blood. - High WBC Count - More than 11,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood. WBCs are of different types. Types Of White Blood Cells - Neutrophils: Fight infections by ingesting microbes like bacteria and fungi. - Eosinophils: Fight large parasites like intestinal worms. These cells also secrete IgE antibodies to combat allergens. - Basophils: Secrete histaminei [X]A chemical found in the body cells of humans that triggers allergic reactions, like runny nose and sneezing. during allergic reactions. - Lymphocytes: Lymphocytes consist of three cells - B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. B cells recognize viruses and release antibodies against them, while T cells and NK cells fight cells infected by viruses and cancer. - Monocytes: Monocytes convert into macrophagesi [X]Type of white blood cells that destroy harmful organisms, clear dead cells, and stimulate the cells of the immune system. and ingest cell debris. Let us now understand how white blood cells protect the body from foreign body invasion. How Do White Blood Cells Help Us? White blood cells are the body's first line of defense against infection. They protect our body from infections by fighting off bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and other foreign invaders. These cells also facilitate the production of antibodies and help destroy infectious agents as well as cancer cells. Fluctuations in the number of white blood cells can occur due to several reasons. You may notice an increase in your white blood cell count during exercise, while the count may drop while you are resting. Pregnancy and postpartum are two important stages of life where you may notice a fluctuating WBC count. A 2021 study in eBioMedicine noted the pattern of the typical white blood cell count in the first week following birth, depending on the mode of delivery. After the delivery of the baby, the WBC count significantly declines and attains a stationary stage. Elective cesarean birth shows the highest decline, while emergency cesarean birth shows the least. For further information, see the graph below. Total white blood cells in the postnatal periodSource: [White blood cells in pregnancy: reference intervals for before and after delivery](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(21)00509-0/fulltext#%20) However, in some cases, the count might drop abnormally. There could be various factors at play, which we have discussed below. What Causes Low White Blood Cell Count? White blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside some of your larger bones. A drop in the WBC count could be a result of the following: - Viral infections - Congenital disorders - Cancer - Autoimmune disorders - Severe infections that require a lot of white blood cells - Medications like antibiotics [Poor nutrition](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/diseases-caused-by-nutritional-deficiency/) - Alcohol abuse A low WBC count that is ineffective in fighting infections results in a condition called leukopenia. What are its signs? Signs And Symptoms Of Low White Blood Cell Count These include: - High fever - Chills - Sweating If your WBC count has dropped because of an infection, you may notice the following symptoms: - Swelling and redness [Mouth sores](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/home-remedies-to-cure-mouth-ulcers/) - A [sore throat](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-for-tonsillitis/) - Severe cough - Shortness of breath A low WBC count is not always critical unless it drops so low that the cells cannot protect your body anymore from infections. In such a situation, certain home remedies can help. Let us find out how to increase white blood cells quickly. How To Increase White Blood Cell Count Naturally 1.

Frequently Asked Questions How long does it take to increase white blood cells? It can take anywhere from a few days to weeks to increase white blood cells with proper treatment and remedies. How many white blood cells are there in the human body? In normal adult bodies, there should be about 4,000-10,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood. Any variation in this count is a sign of an underlying infection in your body. What foods to avoid if you have a low white blood cell count? Avoid uncooked food, raw meat and sushi, and unpasteurized beverages as they may increase your risk of contracting infections and further lower your white blood cell count. What vitamin deficiency reduces white blood cell count? Studies suggest that deficiency of vitamins B and D can be linked to a weaker immunity (and a low white blood cell count) ( [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439950/)), ( [21](https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12931-021-01666-3.pdf)). Hence, consuming a diet (or supplements) rich in these vitamins can boost your immune function. Consult a doctor for more information on the right diet and supplements. Does a low white blood cell count make you tired? No, a low white blood cell count itself is not associated with fatigue. However, if you continue experiencing increased fatigue, it may be the symptom of an underlying issue that needs medical attention. Key Takeaways - White blood cell fluctuation might indicate infections, autoimmune, cancer and congenital disorders, poor nutrition, or the effect of medicines. - White blood cells help fight infections and produce antibodies to fight damaging cells. - Some of the signs of a low white blood cell count are high fever and sweating. - Lavender oil may help boost white blood cell count and overall immunity. - To maintain white blood cell count, an optimal balance diet rich in vitamins, fatty acids, and zinc, and exercise is essential.
