Singh, 85, has been suffering from spinal problems for five years and is now trying herbal remedies. \"There is a slight difference,\" Singh said. \" ... It's only a week now. It will take at least another 12 to 15 sessions. Then we see how it goes.\" Traditional Chinese medicine is becoming more popular in Africa, according to a 2020 study by Development Reimagined, a Beijing international consulting firm. A February 2020 op-ed written by a Beijing think tank researcher and published in the state-run China Daily said such traditional medicine would \"boost the Chinese economy, contribute to global health and prove to be a shot in the arm for China's soft power.\" Potential harm Conventional medical doctors such as Sultan Mantendechere, though, say patients are overlooking the potential harm that some herbal remedies can cause, especially if used too frequently or at too high a dosage. \"They do work in quite a number of circumstances,\" Mantendechere said. \"Having said that, our main worry as practitioners, the medical practitioners, is that the use of herbal medicine is not as regulated as we would want it to Although the safety and effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine is still debated worldwide, herbal practitioners such as Li Chuan continue to gain popularity among those seeking alternative medication.

Kenyan economist Ken Gichinga said herbal medicine could significantly lower African medical expenses if proven effective. \"Africans spend quite a lot of money traveling to countries such as India and the UAE to get treatment\" and would benefit if herbal medicine \"can provide more natural, cost-effective health care,\" he said. In 2021, Kenya's national drug regulator, the Pharmacy and Poisons Board, approved the sale of Chinese herbal health products in the country. Practitioners such as Li hope that more nations will give approval to Chinese herbal medicine in the future. "}
