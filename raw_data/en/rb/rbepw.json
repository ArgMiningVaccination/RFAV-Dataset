But each of these 5 points has its own unique benefits - encompassing both biomedical and Traditional Chinese Medicine functions. Let's take a look at what each one does! Sympathetic: - Promotes a balance between the sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) branches of the nervous system. - Soothes emotions, has an analgesic effect on internal organs, and can help relax muscles that are tight, or braced from trauma. Shenmen: - Shenmen translates as the \"spirit gate\" - it has an overall calming and sedative effect on the mind and body. - It promotes harmony between the TCM organs and their related emotional aspects. Kidney: - Supports the kidneys' role of removing waste and toxins from the bloodstream, balancing minerals, and controlling blood pressure. - Supports adrenal function and helps regulate cortisol (the stress hormone). - Builds resilience to fear and threat, strengthens willpower. Lung: - Strengthens the immune system, respiratory system, and controls sweating. - Supports the processing of grief, sadness, and letting go. Liver: - Supports the liver's functions including detoxification and blood sugar balance. - Calms sympathetic nervous system arousal. - Helps resolve anxiety, anger and aggression. 5 powerful points to support and soothe the body.
