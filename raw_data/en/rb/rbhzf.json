You not only can, but you should. Here are a few vitamins that are known to enhance the outcome of a detox: Vitamin-C has been shown to be a super-powerful [antioxidant](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/antioxidants/sls-20076428). Antioxidants are compounds found in foods that have the ability to: Help your body fight disease, Protect your body against free radicals, Minimize the oxidative damage to your body's cells, and Promote a healthy heart, thus reducing your chance of heart disease. Incorporating vitamin-C into your detox can help to: Improve your skin, Boost your immune system, and Prevent anemia.
