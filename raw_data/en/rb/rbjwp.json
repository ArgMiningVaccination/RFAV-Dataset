The human brain and immune system communicate with each other (Parks, 2015). Healing and recovery include a patient's connection to a belief system that promotes good health, thoughts, feelings, and behavior. I think that culture connects to healing and recovery because our brain can communicate with the immune system. If you are positive, happy, and practice cultural health traditions, your immune can respond to that. Then you will start to heal into the recovery stage. Medicine hugely positively affects healing the human body from almost any illness. Still, if you include that with cultural rituals, your body will respond faster and more effectively. African American healing traditions have 4 structural elements or themes that help their citizens' health. The 4 structural elements are spiritual, power-of-words, ritual, and dreams. I believe that these 4 elements, plus medicine help African Americans live a happy and healthy long life. The second Ted Talk video discusses how having culture matters in health, illness, life, and even death. Art, like music, painting, and pictures, helped to aid people's health during the Renaissance (Agic, 2018). I believe this evidence is true because music and art, which are part of the culture, have helped heal many people from all walks of life. It is important for people to keep practicing their cultural traditions so that they can keep their traditions alive and also live healthy, long life. References Parks, F., (2015).
