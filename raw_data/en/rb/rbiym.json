The education world got utterly changed in 2020 and it continues in 2021! Students, parents, teachers and school leaders have all been impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and each one has had to adapt themselves to the needs of the changing environment. Whether it be teachers adopting technology in their everyday teaching, or school leaders managing the expectations of parents with students learning from home, we are experiencing unprecedented challenges. For many educators, the disruptions caused by this pandemic have raised some important questions, like - \"Are our students learning?\", \"How well are they learning?, \"How best can we help and support our students?\", \"How can we couple assessments and learning tightly to achieve the desired outcomes?\", \"How do we best integrate in-person and remote learning?\", \"Are we completing the syllabus in the time available?\", \"Are there other efficient ways to ensure we are completing syllabi in a way that the learning loss is minimised?\". These are all valid concerns and we truly empathise with the feelings of teachers, parents, students and school leaders. Our efforts in the past year and even now continue not only to closely support teachers in this transitional phase of shifting from classroom to blended learning, but also to create solutions and resources that can help them bridge learning gaps, thereby ensuring minimum learning loss due to the pandemic. Teachers have proved to be the real heroes in the current COVID-19 pandemic situation. They have been quick to learn, adapt and use technology to facilitate online learning, while staying true to their focus on student learning. In order to support them in their endeavour, CBSE along with Educational Initiatives (EI) has put together a list of Essential Concepts in English, Mathematics and Science for classes 1 to 10. The objective of these Essential Concepts is to help prioritise key ideas and distil the ones that are most important for a given topic so that teachers' time is focused on ensuring that students don't miss out on these essential concepts. Given the limited time available for teaching, these Essential Concepts are a must and should be emphasised in order to minimise the learning loss. We hope these Essential Concepts will support teachers in focusing on what is non-negotiable, so that the time available to them for teaching is spent effectively towards improving student learning outcomes.

While on the technology front it has left teachers with many different things to learn and adapt to, on the academic side it has left them with less time to complete the curriculum. One of the priorities listed in the National Education Policy, 2020 is 'Reduce curriculum content to enhance essential learning and critical thinking'. It states that in order to give the desired priority to critical thinking and more holistic learning, the curriculum across subjects will be reduced to cover the 'core essentials'. These mandated essentials will focus on key concepts, ideas, application and problem-solving. This, we believe, is a much needed, bold step towards strengthening our education system. Given the paradigm shift in the education sector due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the recent proposals made in the new policy, which may result in reduced syllabus, our teachers will most likely face the challenge of ensuring 'real understanding' of concepts in a reduced time frame. A sharp focus on core learning and enduring understanding has never before been this crucial to ensure effective learning. EI has always emphasised the need for conceptual clarity and learning with understanding. We use a framework to design our learning and assessment offerings that places emphasis on core learning. While there are always multiple learning goals, every discipline has some big ideas which form the basis for learning other important ideas and skills. These fall under the category of 'core learning' which is the most important part of learning. The other important ideas and skills form what we call 'supporting learning'. And finally, there are facts that are part of a learning unit but may not be very important, which we call 'peripheral learning'. Using this framework, in order to help teachers in prioritisation of key ideas, which becomes even more relevant in the current scenario where the time to teach a concept is limited, we have come up with a list of Essential Concepts . For example, if we take the topic of Heat, there may be many different things the curriculum may cover -from the definition of heat to the understanding of what heat is and how it transfers, from units to measure temperature to the different types of thermometers, from the boiling point of water to the temperature of the sun. While the textbook is written to make it comprehensive from a topic coverage perspective, it is left to the teacher to decide upon the core ideas that the students must understand, and without which building further understanding may not be possible. These ideas are seldom explicitly stated for the teachers, and so depending on the teacher's experience, expertise, comfort with the topic and proportionate discretion, certain ideas may get selected for teaching. Sometimes, while the key ideas may get selected, they may not get prioritised well and may at times get missed out or be given insufficient time. It is okay, in times like a pandemic, for students to lose peripheral learning. However, we need to be diligent to ensure that they are not losing out on core learning. We hope that teachers will be able to refer to this list of concepts while making their lesson plans, in order to ensure that these essential concepts are covered and given sufficient time during teaching.

Different birds have different kinds of feet depending on where they live. Different birds have different kinds of beaks depending on the food they eat. Animals have different types of teeth based on the type of food they eat. Natural Resources Forests provide many useful materials for wildlife and for people. They need to be conserved. Human activities make water sources polluted. Even after cleaning, water can contain germs which cause diseases. Boiling kills most of the germs and makes water safe for drinking. Matter Some things dissolve in water while other things do not. Food and Nutrition Some vegetables and fruits spoil quickly while others stay for longer. Plants Roots absorb water from the soil. Roots provide support to plants. Roots of some plants are modified to store food, and can be eaten by us. 19H2O Grade 5 Essential Concepts | Environmental Studies Animals and Human Body Most animals have some sense organs. Hearing, smell and sight in animals are similar in some way s and di erent in other ways to those in humans. Dierent animals sleep f or dierent durations in a day. The tongue helps in rec ognising di erent tastes. Glucose can be directly used by the body to produce energy, so it can be given directly to the blood. The stomach breaks food into smaller pieces and digests it with the help of digestive juices. Malaria is a disease caused by certain mosquitoes carrying the germs. Anaemia is a condition caused by low amount of iron in the diet and leads to tiredness. Mosquitoes can be controlled by preventing their breeding in stagnant water. Some characteristics are passed on from parents to children. Food and Nutrition Most food items get spoilt if left alone. Many of them can be preserved by drying, or adding salt or sugar. Plants Seeds sprout given the right conditions to form new plants. Seeds get spread far from their parent plant by animals, wind, water, etc. Many common fruits and vegetables that we use originated in other parts of the world. Matter Some objects float in water while others sink. Tw o dierent objects made of the same material may float or sink depending on their shape. Dissolving salt in wat er can a ect whether an object floats or sinks. Some liquids flow more easily than others. Force and Motion Everything that is thrown up falls back to the Earth because of gravity. In a spaceship far away from the Earth, the force due to gravity is very weak and things can float around. Natural Resources Petrol and diesel are fuels dug up from under the ground, and will get over in the future. Heat and Energy How things can be made warm or made to cool down. Air has moisture which forms a mist on cold surfaces.

Mansi looked at the Moon on a clear, cloudless night. Shown below is what she observed. She looked at the Moon again after 2 days. What could the Moon have looked like? 24622 students attempted this questions. 35.5% students selected the correct answer, option B. Around 35% students selected option C, indicating that they may not have observed the moon changing shape and how many days it takes to go from half moon to full moon (around 7 days). While C was the most common wrong answer, almost 28% students selected A and D, indicating a similar lack of observation skills. 21Food, its sources and components All food that is available comes from either plant or animal sources. Sun is the ultimate source of energy. A minimum amount of each of the nutrients, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, mineralsand water are needed by the body daily. Dierent food items contain di erent amounts of nutrients and so the diet needs to compriseof food items in a way that we get the minimum amount of nutrients needed daily. This kind ofdiet is called a balanced diet. The kind of balanced diet ma y dier from one individual to another depending on the age,gender, occupation and other factors. Separation of substances Depending o n the properties of the particles in the mixture l ike size, weight, solubility in liquids etc., dif f erent methods can be used to separate the substances i n a mixture. Water changes into vapour on heating. Vapour condenses to water on cooling. Evaporation and condensation are processes that continuously take place. At a given temperature, only a certain amount of a substance can be dissolved in a given liquid. Changes around us It is easy to get back substances lost in some changes/processes. Such changes arereversible changes. Heating generally leads to expansion of material whereas cooling leads to contraction. Plants Plants take in water and minerals from the soil through their roots and transport them todierent parts of the plant through specific vessels in the stem. Leaves help in exchange of gases and in preparing food for the plant. Using the water taken in by the roots and carbon dioxide from the air, plants preparefood in the presence of sunlight and a greenpigment (chlorophyll). Excess food produced by the plants is transported from the leaves t o the di erent parts of the plants through specific vessels inthe stem and stored in the form of starch. Water in the form of water vapour escapes plants through leaves by a process calledtranspiration.Movement in humans Bones and cartilages form the skeletal system which provides a structure to the body, helps in movement and protects certain body parts. Joints are places in our body where two bones connect. They help in moving and bending di erent body parts. Depending on the type of joint present, dierent body parts move and bend in dierent ways. Bones are connected to muscles and alternate contraction and relaxation of two muscles connected to a bone help in moving it. Living organisms and their surroundings A living organism needs food and water, respires and excretes, reproduces, grows, canmove and can respond to stimuli. An object needs to satisfy a set of requirements, and not just one or twocharacteristics, to be called living. The factors required for life vary across habitats and across seasons within a habitat. Over a certain period of time as the factors in the environment change, specificfeatures/characteristics that someorganisms may possess enable bettersurvival of those organisms. These featuresget preferred over other in that given set ofenvironment. This process of adjustmentthat the organisms go through is calledadaptation. Depending on the habitat, certain features/characteristics may be observed inthe living organisms. Adaptations help living organisms survive better in a given habitat. To locate an object or place, the distance and direction needs to be given in reference to aspecific point. Length can be measured and expressed using any other object; however, to ensurestandardisation and be able to comparelengths easily, formal units (like cm, m etc.)are used to measure and express length. Displacement is the change in position of an object whereas distance indicates the totalpath length covered from a given point. An object is said to be in motion when its position changes with time. Motion can be classified int o dierent types based on certain properties.H2O Grade 6 Essential Concepts | Science 22Motion and measurement of distance An electric cell is a source of electricity. Some materials (conductors of electricity) let electricity to pass through whereas some materials (insulators) don't. Electricity flows from one terminal of the electric cell, through the conductor, to the other terminal of the electric cell. Without such a closed circuit, electricity cannot flow. Magnets Magnets can exert force on other magnets and certain objects. A magnet has two poles - north and south; like poles of magnets repel each otherwhereas unlike poles attract. Water Water evaporates all the time and not only when water is boiled. Evaporation of water results in pure water vapour, without any dissolved substances in it. The water vapour in the atmosphere comes from living beings, from evaporation from thesurface of water bodies and groundwater. Only water vapour condenses to give liquid water. Condensed water droplets are present in the air surrounding us as well as in clouds. Water on the earth continuously cycles through its di-erent states; the water cycledoes not have a beginning or an end and it isnot lost during the water cycle. There is limited amount of usable water and so it is important to conserve water.Air Air is found everywhere and it occupies space. Air is composed of di fferent gases; majority of air is nitrogen and oxygen whereas carbon dioxide, water vapour and other gases are present to a small extent. Oxygen and carbon dioxide cycle continuously through the living organisms and the atmosphere. Classification of object Depending on what the purpose of classification is, things having similarcharacteristics can be put into one group andseparated from the others which don'tpossess that characteristics. The same set of objects can be regrouped into di-erent groups depending on thepurpose of classification. To make the study of living organisms more systematic, a universally accepted scheme ofclassification is in place which classifies livingthings based on certain rules. Classification ofliving things is hierarchical - a given groupmay be a part of a larger group which may bea part of another larger group. Light A light source and an object are required for a shadow to form. A shadow is formed when light from a source is blocked by an object. Each light source directed at an object will create a shadow. Shadow falls in the direction opposite to that of the light source.H2O Grade 6 Essential Concepts | Science Few examples of what can be skipped in interest of time: Knowing specifics of processes like 'spinning', 'weaving', 'knitting' etc. What 'winnowing' or 'sieving' is and where it is used.

The bulb will glow in exactly the same way.D. The bulb will not glow, but not get damaged14245 students attempted this question. Only 37.5% students got this question correct (option C). Around 40% students think that the bulb will not glow, but not get damaged (option D). 23ElectricityNutrition in Plants Plants produce food through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide are combined to form carbohydrates while oxygen is released as a by-product. Most living organisms other than plants, depend directly or indirectly on the food produced through photosynthesis. Nutrition in Animals The main parts of the human digestive system. The digestion of starch begins in the mouth. The digestion of proteins happens mainly in the stomach. The digestion of fats happens mainly in the small intestine. The digested food is absorbed by the blood in the small intestine. The excess water in the food is absorbed by the large intestine. Liver and pancreas secrete digestive juices and help in digestion, but food does not passthrough them. Grass-eating animals like cattle have special bacteria in their digestive system that help todigest cellulose. Heat Sense of touch is not a reliable way to check the hotness or coldness of an object. The measure of hotness or coldness of an object is called temperature. Temperature can be measured using the expansion of a liquid in a thermometer. Heat flows from a hotter object to a colder object. Transfer of heat from one end of an object to the other is called conduction. Some materials conduct heat well while other materials do not. Heat can be transferred by the movement of a fluid - this is called convection. Heat can be transmitted without a medium, through radiation. This is how Sun's heatreaches us. Woollen clothes keep us warm because the air trapped in the wool is a poor conductor ofheat and prevents the loss of body heat. Acids, Bases and Salts Acids are sour in taste. Bases are bitter in taste and soapy to touch. An acid and a base neutralise each other to produce salt and water. Indicators show di erent colour in acidic, basic and neutral solutions. Acids turn blue litmus red, bases turn red litmus blue.Physical and Chemical Changes Properties such as shape, size, colour and state are physical properties. A change in the physical properties is called a physical change. No new substance is formed in a physical change. A change in which a new substance is formed is a chemical change. Rusting of iron is a chemical change because the product rust is a new substance, different from iron. Weather, Climate and Adaptations to Climate The condition of the atmosphere at a place at a given time is called weather. The long-term weather pattern of a place is called climate. Animals living in polar climate have thick fur to protect them from the cold, and wide feetto walk on snow. Wind, S t orms and Cyclones Wind blows from a high-pressure region to a low-pressure region. Warm air is lighter than cool air, and rises up. High wind speed reduces air pressure. Soil The breaking down of rocks by the action of wind, water and heat is called weathering. The rotting dead matter in the soil is called humus. The main types of soil are sand, clay and loam. Depending on the composition, di erent types of soil have di erent water-holdingcapacity. Respiration in Organisms The breakdown of food to release energy happens in all the cells of the body. Cellular respiration can happen with or without oxygen. In the presence of oxygen, glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide and water. During intense exercise, muscle cells run out of oxygen and respire anaerobically, breaking glucose into lactic acid. In other organisms like yeast, anaerobic respiration produces alcohol by breaking down glucose. During inhalation, the diaphragm moves down making the chest cavity larger and causes air to move into the lungs. During exhalation, the diaphragm moves back up making the chest cavity smaller and causes air to move out of the lungs. The air breathed out contains around 16% oxygen and 4% carbon dioxide. Plants respire, all the time.H2O Grade 7 Essential Concepts | Science Transportation in Animals and Plants Blood contains three main types of cells - RBCs which contain haemoglobin and transport oxygen, white blood cells which fight against infections and platelets which help in clotting. There are two types of blood vessels - arteries which carry blood away from the heart and veins which carry blood towards the heart. Arteries divide into very small blood vessels called capillaries which bring the blood into contact with di erent tissues. The heart has four chambers - two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. The partition between the chambers prevents the mixing of oxygen-rich blood with carbon dioxide-rich blood. Waste substances are removed from the blood in the blood capillaries in the kidneys. The wastes form urine, which is transported to the urinary bladder through the ureters. In plants, xylem transports water and dissolved minerals while phloem transports food substances. The continuous evaporation of water from leaves is called transpiration. It helps to pull water up through xylem. Reproduction in Plants Plants can reproduce sexually or asexually. When new plants are produced from roots, leaves, stem and buds, it is called vegetative propagation, a form of asexual reproduction. Reproduction through the production of seeds is sexual reproduction. Flowers are the reproductive parts of a plant. The male gametes are produced in the anther while the female gametes are produced in the ovary. The transfer of pollen from anther to stigma is called pollination. Motion and Time Speed is equal to the distance covered divided by the time taken. When an object repeats its motion in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in periodic motion. The to-and-fro motion of a simple pendulum is periodic motion. It is also called oscillatory motion. The commonly used units of speed are m/s and km/h. The motion of an object can be represented on a distance-time graph.Electric Current and Its E' ects Symbols of electric components. Electric current flows only through a complete circuit. Electric current heats the wire through which it flows. The heating e ect of electric current is used in a fuse to protect circuits against excess current. A magnetic needle gets deflected when kept near a current-carrying wire. A coil of wire acts like a bar magnet when current passes through it, and is called an electromagnet.

They don't seem to understand that when a bar magnet is cut, each piece acts like a bar magnet and so the end indicated will act like a south pole. Instead, these students seem to be going merely by the 'N' indicated on the bar and think that it will be attracted to the south pole. 26H2O Grade 8 Essential Concepts | Science organism's body (external fertilisation). In some organisms, the larvae develop into adults through a series of drastic changes. This is called metamorphosis. Reaching the Age of Adolescence During puberty, boys and girls become capable of reproduction. The changes during puberty are brought about by the male hormone or testosterone in boysand the female hormone or oestrogen in girls. In female humans, the reproductive phase starts at puberty and lasts till about 45-50 years of age. One ovum matures and is released by the ovaries every 28-30 days. If fertilisation does not occur, the lining of the uterus along with blood is shed by the body. This is called menstruation. The sex of a baby is determined by the sex chromosomes of the gametes that fuse. A female has two X chromosomes while a male has an X chromosome and a Y chromosome. Force and Pressure A push or pull on an object is called force. A force brings about a change in the state of motion of an object. A force can change the shape of an object. Forces which act between objects in contact with each other are called contact forces. E.g. friction. Forces which act between objects not in contact with each other are called non-contact forces. E.g. gravity, magnetism. The force acting on a unit area is called pressure. Liquids and gases exert pressure on the walls of a container. The pressure exerted by the air due to its weight is called atmospheric pressure. Friction Force due to friction opposes the relative motion of two surfaces in contact. Friction is caused by the irregularities in the two surfaces in contact. The force required to overcome friction when an object just begins to move is called static friction. The force required to keep an object moving with a constant speed is called sliding friction. This is usually smaller than static friction. In some cases, friction is beneficial, while in others it is undesirable. Lubricants are used to reduce friction. When one body rolls over another, the resistance to its motion is called rolling friction. This is less than sliding friction. Fluids also exert a force due to friction on objects moving inside them. Streamlined shapes are used for objects that move in air or water, to minimise fluid friction.Sound Sound is produced when an object vibrates. Sound cannot travel through vacuum. The number of vibrations (oscillations) per second is called the frequency of oscillation. Human beings can usually hear sound having frequency between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Amplitude is a measure of how large each vibration is. The loudness of sound depends on amplitude. Chemical Eects of Electric Current Water usually contains small amounts of dissolved salts and other impurities which make it a good electrical conductor. Distilled water is a poor conductor. A chemical reaction can be made to happen when electric current passes through a solution. Some Natural Phenomena Lightning is a discharge of electricity on a massive scale. There are two types of charges - positive and negative. Like charges repel while unlike charges attract. An electroscope can be used to check whether an object is electrically charged or not. Light When light is reflected o a surface, angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The human eye has a lens which forms a real image on the retina. Stars and the Solar System The phases of the Moon occur due to its revolution around the Earth. Light year is a very large unit of distance that is equal to the distance travelled by light in a year. A group of stars with a recognisable shape is called a constellation. The Solar System consists of the Sun, eight planets and their satellites, asteroids and comets. Pollution of Air and Water The main cause of pollution of air are exhaust from vehicles and factories. Some of the pollutants such as carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases which cause global warming. Chlorofluorocarbons damage the ozone layer which protects us from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Water is polluted mainly due to euents fr om industries and runo of chemical fertilisers from agricultural fields.Crop Production and Management Plants get various minerals from the soil. Three of them - N, P and K - are particularlyimportant and needed in significant quantities. Crop rotation is a technique used to allow the minerals in the soil to be replenished. Advantages and disadvantages of chemical fertilisers and organic manures. Microorganisms: Friend or Foe Not all microorganisms are harmful. Some bacteria help in making curd and in fixing soilnitrogen. Some fungi help in fermentation. Some microorganisms cause diseases. They are called pathogens. Synthetic Fibres and Plastics A polymer is a substance whose particles are made of several repeating units. Polymers can be natural or synthetic. Synthetic fibres are generally water resistant. Synthetic fibres may easily melt near a fire, so they should not be worn in the kitchen. Plastics are of two types: thermosetting which cannot be remoulded, andthermoplastics which can be remoulded. Plastics are non-biodegradable, so they should be recycled if possible and their usemust be minimised. Materials: Metals and Non-Metals Metals are generally hard, lustrous, malleable, sonorous and good conductors of heat andelectricity. Both metals and non-metals react with oxygen to form oxides. Generally metallic oxides arebasic while non-metallic oxides are acidic. Metals react with acids to form hydrogen gas. A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from a solution of its compound. Coal and Petroleum Coal was formed from the dead remains of plants which got buried deep under the soilmillions of years ago. Petroleum was formed from the dead remains of marine organisms that got buried underthe sea bed millions of years ago. Petroleum is a mixture of many substances and is separated into its components by aprocess called refining. Petrol, diesel andcooking gas are such separated components. Natural gas is found along with petroleum and is the cleanest fossil fuel. Combustion and Flame Combustion is the reaction of a substance with oxygen to release heat. The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is called ignition temperature.Substances with very low ignition temperature are called inflammable substances. Fire can be controlled by removing one of the three requirements of fire - fuel, air or ignitiontemperature. Water should not be used to extinguish electrical fires. Carbon dioxide should be used instead. Not everything burns with a flame. Substances which do not vaporise on heatingburn without a flame. Conservation of Plants and Animals Deforestation has severe environmental consequences such as droughts anddesertification. Endemic species are those species of plants and animals which are found exclusively in aparticular area. Species whose population has decreased drastically and face the threat of extinctionare known as endangered species. The sum total of all the biotic and abiotic factors comprising a habitat is called anecosystem. Cell - Structure and Function Cells are the basic structural and functional unit of life. The size and shape of a cell is related to its function, not to the size of the organism. The cell membrane separates the contents of a cell from the surroundings. It regulates the entry and exit of substances to and from the cell. Plant cells have an additional cell wall which gives extra protection to the plant cells. The nucleus contains genetic information which helps in the inheritance ofcharacteristics from parents to ospring. Cells of a leaf have small green bodies called chloroplasts which are a type of plastids.These contain chlorophyll and carry outphotosynthesis. Reproduction in Animals Male gametes are called sperms and are produced in the male reproductive organscalled testes. Female gametes are called ova and are produced in the female reproductive organscalled ovaries. During fertilisation in humans, a sperm fuses with an ovum inside the female organism'sbody to form a zygote. The zygote develops into an embryo and gets implanted in the uterus. The stage of development when the body parts are identifiable is called foetus. In some other animals such as frogs and fish, fertilisation happens outside the female 27H2O Grade 8 Essential Concepts | Science organism's body (external fertilisation). In some organisms, the larvae develop into adults through a series of drastic changes. This is called metamorphosis. Reaching the Age of Adolescence During puberty, boys and girls become capable of reproduction. The changes during puberty are brought about by the male hormone or testosterone in boysand the female hormone or oestrogen in girls. In female humans, the reproductive phase starts at puberty and lasts till about 45-50years of age. One ovum matures and is released by the ovaries every 28-30 days. If fertilisation doesnot occur, the lining of the uterus along withblood is shed by the body. This is calledmenstruation. The sex of a baby is determined by the sex chromosomes of the gametes that fuse. Afemale has two X chromosomes while a malehas an X chromosome and a Y chromosome.

Around 38% students selected option A and 29% students selected option B indicating that they have a misconception that the gaseous exchange happens only in certain organs. They don't understand that it happens in all the parts of the body. 29H2O Grade 9 Essential Concepts | Science Motion Displacement is the shortest path between the final and initial positions. Velocity is equal to the displacement divided by time. Acceleration is equal to the change in velocity divided by time. The accelerated motion of an object in a straight line can be described using the threeequations of motion. The motion of an object can be represented on a distance-time graph or a velocity-time graph. Displacement is equal to the area under the velocity-time graph. Laws of Motion An object will continue to be in a state of rest or uniform motion unless there is anunbalanced force acting on it. Momentum is the product of mass and velocity. Force, mass and acceleration are related by the equation F = ma When a force is applied by object A on object B, an equal and opposite force is applied byobject B on object A. Total momentum is conserved during a collision. Gravitation Any two objects exert a force of gravitation on each other given by F = Gm 1m2/d2 For objects on or near the surface of the Earth, the acceleration due to gravity can beconsidered constant; g = GM/R 2 Density of a substance is equal to the mass divided by volume. When an object is fully or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upward force that isequal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it.Work and Energy Work done is the product of force and displacement. Energy is the capacity to do work. Energy of an object due to its motion is kinetic energy; KE = \u00bd mv 2 The energy stored in an object due to its shape or position is potential energy; gravitational PEof an object at a height = mgh Total amount of energy remains constant. Power is the rate of doing work; power = work/time Sound Sound waves are longitudinal waves - the vibrations take place along the direction ofpropagation. A sound wave can be described by its frequency, wavelength and speed. Why do We Fall Ill Viruses do not have life processes of their own but use the host cells for replication, so they aredicult to eliminate using drugs. Vaccination is the use of weakened or dead pathogens to stimulate an immune responsefrom the body for protection against diseases. Natural Resources The main elements important for life get transferred repeatedly between the biotic andabiotic components in the form ofbiogeochemical cycles - nitrogen cycle, carboncycle, oxygen cycleMatter in Our Surroundings Matter is made of particles which are in continuous motion. Temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of the particles. Particles of matter attract each other. The properties of solids, liquids and gases can be understood in terms of the arrangement ofthe particles. At melting and boiling points, the temperature of a substance remains the same even when itcontinues to be heated. The excess heat goesinto overcoming the forces of attraction. Applying pressure can help in liquefying a gas. Evaporation happens at all temperatures, boiling happens only at the boiling point. Is Matter Around Us Pure? Based on the size of solid particles in a solid-liquid mixture, it can be classified as asolution, a colloid or a suspension. A solution is homogeneous, cannot be separated using a filter paper and does not scatter light. The particles do not settle down. A colloid is heterogeneous, cannot be separated using a filter paper and scatters light.The particles do not settle down. A suspension is heterogeneous, can be separated using a filter paper and scatters light.The particles settle down if left undisturbed. The solid components of a colloid can be separated by centrifugation. Two miscible liquids can be separated by distillation based on the difierence in theirboiling points. An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances through achemical reaction. A compound is formed when two or more elements react with each other; the compoundhas properties which are distinct from those ofthe combining elements. Atoms and Molecules Mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. The atoms of each element have a characteristic atomic mass. Valency is the combining capacity of an atom of an element. Valency can help in finding the molecular formula of a compound. The sum of the masses of all the atoms in a molecule is called molecular mass. A mole of a substance is that quantity having mass numerically equal to the molecular mass,but in grams. The number of particles in one mole of any substance is 6.022 x 10 23 (Avogadro constant).Structure of the Atom Most of the mass of an atom Is concentrated in the nucleus of the atom, which containspositively charged protons and neutralneutrons. Negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus in discrete shells. The number of electrons that can be accommodated in each shell can be determined by the 2n 2 rule. Atoms generally gain, lose or share electrons to attain an octet of electrons in the outermostshell to become stable. The number of protons in the nucleus of an element is called atomic number. The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called mass number. In nature, there can be atoms of the same element with difierent mass number, these arecalled isotopes. The Fundamental Unit of Life The outer covering of a cell which separates it from the surroundings is called the cellmembrane; it regulates the entry and exit ofsubstances to and from the cell. Substances like oxygen and carbon dioxide difiuse across the cell membrane, from a regionof high concentration to a region of lowerconcentration. Osmosis is the difiusion of water from a region of high concentration (low solute content) to aregion of lower concentration (high solutecontent) Plant cells have an additional outer layer made of cellulose called cell wall; it allows plant cellsto withstand a higher internal pressure. The nucleus contains genetic material and plays a central role in cellular reproduction. Cellular respiration is carried out by mitochondria; in plant cells, photosynthesis iscarried out by chloroplasts. Tissues A group of cells similar in structure and function is called a tissue. In p lants, there are t wo broad types of tissues - meristematic and permanent. Meristematic tissue is f ound in buds a nd can differentiate into any other type of tissue. There are four main t ypes of tissues in animals - epithelial, connective, muscular a nd nervous. Blood is a type o f connective tissue. Diversity of Living Organisms The classification of living organisms is related to their evolution. 30Motion Displacement is the shortest path between the final and initial positions.

Almost equal number of students selected options A, B and C indicating difierent misconceptions like only objects above room temperature can lose heat, only objects with temperature greater than 0 degrees can lose heat or ice loses heat on melting. 31H2O Grade 10 Essential Concepts | Science Electricity Current is the charge flowing through a conductor per unit time. Potential dierence between two points is the work done to move a unit charge from onepoint to the other. Ohm's law - for a given conductor at a constant temperature, the current flowing through it isdirectly proportional to the voltage between itsends. The resistance of a conductor is directly proportional to its length and inverselyproportional to the cross-sectional area. For a series circuit with three resistances R1, R2 and R3, equivalent resistance R = R1 + R2 + R3. For a parallel circuit with three resistances R1, R2 and R3, equivalent resistance is given by 1/R= 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 Heat produced in a conductor Q = V x I x tMagnetic Eects of Electric Current Circular magnetic field lines exist around a straight conductor carrying a current. The magnetic field lines of a circular loop of current resemble those of a bar magnet. A stronger magnetic field is produced if there are many turns of wire in the coil. The presence of a magnetic substance like soft iron inside the coil also makes the field stronger. A magnetic field exerts a force on a current carrying conductor. The direction of the force isgiven by the Fleming's left-hand rule. An electric current is induced in a coil when a magnet is moved in and out of the coil. Thedirection of induced current is given by theFleming's right-hand rule.Chemical Reactions and Equations In a balanced chemical equation, the number of atoms of each element on the LHS and RHS should be equal. Based on the nature of the changes happening to the reactants, chemical reactions are broadlyclassified as combination, decomposition,simple displacement and double displacement. Acids, Bases and Salts Metals react with acids to form salt and hydrogen. Metal carbonates and bicarbonates react with acids to form salt, water and carbon dioxide. Metal oxides and hydroxides react with acids to form salt and water. Acids and bases produce ions on dissolving in water. pH scale is used to measure the hydrogen ion concentration which indicates the strength ofacids and bases. Metals and Non-metals Generally metal oxides are basic and non-metal oxides are acidic. A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from a solution of its salt. A metal reacts with a non-metal by donating electrons to the non-metal and forming ionicbonds. Carbon and Its Compounds Carbon atoms attain stability by sharing four electrons and forming covalent bonds. Carbon forms a large number and variety of compounds due to its tetravalency, ability toform double and triple bonds and to link upwith other carbon atoms. A functional group is a group of atoms attached to a carbon chain, giving a compoundits special properties. Periodic Classification of Elements In the modern periodic table, elements are arranged in the increasing order of their atomicnumbers. The period and group which an element belongs to indicate the electronic configurationof the atoms of the element. Generally the metallic character of an element increases down a group and decreases across aperiod. Life Processes The energy released in respiration is used to synthesise a molecule called ATP which drivesall the processes of the cell. The filtering of wastes from the blood happens in a special structure in the kidneys called anephron.Control and Coordination The transmission of information in the nervous system happens with the help of special cellscalled neurons. In certain dangerous situations, decisions and actions are taken by reflex arcs and not by thebrain. Most of the information processing happens in the brain. How Do Organisms Reproduce? DNA in the cells transmit hereditary information from parents to ospring. Heredity and Evolution Sexual reproduction gives rise to a large variation in the characteristics of the ospring. Each individual organism produced by sexual reproduction has two sets of genes, one set inherited from each parent. Inherited traits can be dominant or recessive. Recessive traits are passed on to the ospringonly when both the parents have the same trait. When two populations of the same species get separated and large changes accumulate overtime, they may not be able to interbreed. Insuch cases, a new species is said to have beenformed.

Ohm's law - for a given conductor at a constant temperature, the current flowing through it isdirectly proportional to the voltage between itsends. The resistance of a conductor is directly proportional to its length and inverselyproportional to the cross-sectional area. For a series circuit with three resistances R1, R2 and R3, equivalent resistance R = R1 + R2 + R3. For a parallel circuit with three resistances R1, R2 and R3, equivalent resistance is given by 1/R= 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 Heat produced in a conductor Q = V x I x tMagnetic Eects of Electric Current Circular magnetic field lines exist around a straight conductor carrying a current. The magnetic field lines of a circular loop of current resemble those of a bar magnet. A stronger magnetic field is produced if there are many turns of wire in the coil. The presence of a magnetic substance like soft iron inside the coil also makes the field stronger. A magnetic field exerts a force on a current carrying conductor. The direction of the force isgiven by the Fleming's left-hand rule. An electric current is induced in a coil when a magnet is moved in and out of the coil. Thedirection of induced current is given by theFleming's right-hand rule. Electricity Current is the charge flowing through a conductor per unit time.

Based on the nature of the changes happening to the reactants, chemical reactions are broadlyclassified as combination, decomposition,simple displacement and double displacement. Acids, Bases and Salts Metals react with acids to form salt and hydrogen. Metal carbonates and bicarbonates react with acids to form salt, water and carbon dioxide. Metal oxides and hydroxides react with acids to form salt and water. Acids and bases produce ions on dissolving in water. pH scale is used to measure the hydrogen ion concentration which indicates the strength ofacids and bases. Metals and Non-metals Generally metal oxides are basic and non-metal oxides are acidic. A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from a solution of its salt. A metal reacts with a non-metal by donating electrons to the non-metal and forming ionicbonds. Carbon and Its Compounds Carbon atoms attain stability by sharing four electrons and forming covalent bonds. Carbon forms a large number and variety of compounds due to its tetravalency, ability toform double and triple bonds and to link upwith other carbon atoms. A functional group is a group of atoms attached to a carbon chain, giving a compoundits special properties. Periodic Classification of Elements In the modern periodic table, elements are arranged in the increasing order of their atomicnumbers. The period and group which an element belongs to indicate the electronic configurationof the atoms of the element. Generally the metallic character of an element increases down a group and decreases across aperiod. Life Processes The energy released in respiration is used to synthesise a molecule called ATP which drivesall the processes of the cell. The filtering of wastes from the blood happens in a special structure in the kidneys called anephron.Control and Coordination The transmission of information in the nervous system happens with the help of special cellscalled neurons. In certain dangerous situations, decisions and actions are taken by reflex arcs and not by thebrain. Most of the information processing happens in the brain. How Do Organisms Reproduce? DNA in the cells transmit hereditary information from parents to ospring. Heredity and Evolution Sexual reproduction gives rise to a large variation in the characteristics of the ospring. Each individual organism produced by sexual reproduction has two sets of genes, one setinherited from each parent. Inherited traits can be dominant or recessive. Recessive traits are passed on to the ospringonly when both the parents have the same trait. When two populations of the same species get separated and large changes accumulate overtime, they may not be able to interbreed. Insuch cases, a new species is said to have beenformed.
