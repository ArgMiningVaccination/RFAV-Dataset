The study drug, A -101 (hydrogen peroxide) 45% Topical Solution (hereafter referred to as A -101) is a colorless solution that must be stored at room temperature ( 15-25\u00ba C or 59 -77 \u00ba F). The blinded vehicle solution is packaged to match the active study drug and will be stored under the same conditio ns. Study Objectives: Primary: The main objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effect of A-101 45% vs Vehicle when applied to 1 common Target W art (verruca vulgaris) on the trunk or extremities . Secondary : The secondary objectives of thi s study include: Evaluate the clinical effect of A -101 45% when applied to all treated Warts (Target plus Non - Target Warts) Dura tion of response in all treated Warts ( Target Warts plus Non-Target Warts ) Safety of A-101 45% Study Design: This is a phase 2, randomized , multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of A -101 4 5% vs Vehicle in subjects with common warts on the trunk or extremities . Subjects may have up to a total of 4 treated common warts located on their trunk or extremities . Inves tigator s will be required to identify 1 Target Wart for treatment with A -101 study medication. An additional 3 Non -Target Warts may be treated and followed throughout the study protocol therapy. All identified Common Warts will be treated once a week fo r 8 weeks. Subjects will be followed for 3 months after the last weekly treatment. Approximately 120 evaluable subject s will be randomized to one of 2 treatment arms in a 1: 1 ratio. The duration of study participation is anticipated to be up to a m aximum of 155 days per subject. All subjects will be fol lowed for at least 12 weeks after the last study medication treatment. Safety will be evaluated based on clinical laboratory studies (hematology and clinical chemistry), vital signs, assessment of local skin reactions (LSRs), assessment of adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medication review. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 8 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 Efficacy will be evaluated based on assessment of each Target and Non -Target Wart according to the Physician Wart Assessment (P WA).

Study Drug Administration Study drug medication will be applied to each Target and Non -Target Wart meeting the requirements for treatmen t/retreatment during Visits 2 through 9. The study drug will be applied by the subject in the presence of the treating physician or a member of the investigational site staff who is a trained healthcare professional . Subjects between the ages of 8 and 17 years of age will have their A -101 study medication applied by the investigational research staff. Study medication must be applied to each of the Target and Non -Target Wart s for approximately 15 seconds. The treated warts must remain undisturbed for approximately 15 seconds. This treatment cycle may be repeated up to 3 times to each Target and Non -Target Wart. Statistical Methods Efficacy Analysis The primary efficacy analysis will be a comparison between treatment groups based on the mean cha nge in Target Wart PWA from Baseline (Visit 2) to Visit 10, using Analysis of Covariance with Baseline PWA as the covariate. Secondary efficacy analyses will include comparisons between treatment groups based on the following: the proportion of subjects w ith the Target Wart Clear (PWA = 0) at Visit 10 using Fisher's Exact Test ; the proportion of subjects with all treated warts Clear at Visit 10 using a Cochran - Mantel -Haenszel test strati fied by number of treated warts; and the mean of per -subject percent ages of all treated w arts that are clear at Visit 10 using Analysis of Variance . Durability of response in the Active treatment group will be evaluated by calculating the proportion of those treated warts achieving a PWA status of Clear at Visit 10 which continue to maintain a PWA status of Clear at Visit 13. This analysis will be performed separately for Target Warts, and for all treated warts. The 95% confidence limits around the calculated proportions will also be calculated in order to estimate the population lower limit value of the observed sample proportions. Safety Analysis Safety endpoints for adverse events (AEs) include the following: incidences of all treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) and all serious AEs (SAEs); by severity, by relationship to s tudy drug and discontinuation of patients from study due to AEs. Safety endpoints for AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examinations and local skin reactions will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). All safety end points will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

Summary Warts are benign proliferations of the skin and mucosa that are caused by infection of keratinocytes by subtypes of the human papilloma virus (HPV) family. Cutaneous HPV subtypes are a subset of this large group of the DNA papill omavirus family that is capable of infecting humans and causing cutaneous lesions. HPVs are ubiquitous in the environment and infection occurs most commonly through direct contact with individuals who harbor the virus clinically (eviden t lesions) or subcli nically, indirectly through exposure to contaminated surfaces, or even by autoinoculation of virus from individual lesions to adjacent uninfected skin. Cutaneous manifestations of HPV infection include common warts (verruca vulgaris), palmar and plantar wa rts, mosaic warts, flat warts, and butcher's warts. Common warts are generally small, rounded, hyperkeratotic, exophytic dome -shaped papules or nodules and are typically associated with HPV subtypes 1, 2 or 4 though other subtypes are reported. Lesions are most commonly located on the fingers (including periungual and subungual regions), dorsal surfaces of the hands, and sites prone to trauma ( e.g., knees, elbows), but commonly occur at virtually any other anatomical location, potentially spreading by autoi noculation from the finger/hand lesions. In immunocompetent individuals, many common cutaneous warts (up to 2/3rds in some reports) may spontaneously resolve in less than 2 years. However, they often persist for many years, may be large and/or cosmetically unsightly ( e.g., face, hands), spread to distant anatomical regions by autoinoculation, be painful and/or prone to trauma, and, importantly, provide a significant reservoir of HPV infection in the community, placing (especially immunocompromised) individu als at risk for significant morbidity. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 14 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 There are currently no specific antiviral therapies available to treat cutaneous HPV infection and there is no FDA -approved topical treatment for cutaneous common warts. Existing therapies, many of which are off -label uses of drugs approved for other indications, and many of which have never undergone the drug approval process, are of unproven safety and/or efficacy, and are generally directed towards either the direct physical destruction of the lesions with locally destructive or ablative modalities such as cryotherapy, electrosurgery, curettage, application of acids ( e.g., salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid); locally cytotoxic therapies, such topical dibutyl ester) or lesion removal. Several of these therapies are also available as over -the-counter (OTC) wart thera pies in lesser exposures than used in the office setting ( e.g., topical salicylic acid preparations, home freezing kits). Systemic therapy with agents such as cimetidine, and even local occlusion with duct tape have also been anecdotally reported to be eff ective in some cases. While these methods may achieve cure in some cases, many require multiple visits to a physician's office, and may require providers with specialized training and the use of expensive equipment. Such procedures can be painful, may requ ire anesthesia and/or analgesia, and they can be complicated by adverse cosmetic outcomes including scarring at the treatment site, as well as the typical post -surgical risks of bleeding and infection. No one therapy is consistently effective in all cases and, in fact, there is great variability among practitioners in the methods employed using each of these techniques with great variability of the results. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is the simplest peroxide and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods including chlorine -free bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, and disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 has been employed as the oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has be en used in oral hygiene products and tooth -whitening systems for many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment of wastewater. In high concentrations, it is used in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, in addition to its use as an ora l topical agent noted above, H 2O2 is widely employed at low concentrations ( e.g., 3%-6%) as a wound irrigant and topical antiseptic/disinfectant, and has been in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by Richardson in 1858. (Schumb WC 1955) (Chan HP 2008) (Richardson, On Peroxide of Hydrogen, or Ozone, or Water as a Remedy: Continued from a Research Commenced in the Year 1858 1891) (Richardson, On Peroxide of Hydrogen, or Ozone, or Water, as a Remedy: Continued from Research Commence d in the Year 1858 1891) (Richardson, On the Introduction of Peroxide of Hydrogen as a Medicine 1866) (Watt BE 2004 )(Zonios 2007) . Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. 15 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species on the skin are mitigated by the presence of a complex antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, lipoamine, well as non - enzymatic compo nents including ascorbic acid, urates and glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other -soluble groups. The local application of supra - physiologic concentrations of H 2O2 may overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the ski n, allowing H 2O2 to act not only through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of reactive oxygen species, and local lipid peroxidation, but also by the generation of local concentrations of O 2 that are toxic to the abnormal lesional (seborrh eic keratosis) cells. An investigator -initiated, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel group study of hydrogen peroxide solution in adult subjects wi th common warts of the hand (WART -01), was conducted utilizing once weekly applications (maximum of four applications) of A -101 (hydrogen peroxide) 40% topical solution or placebo (vehicle) topical solution to investigate the potential utility of a 40% hyd rogen peroxide topical solution for the treatment of common warts on the hands. A total of 15 subjects received 4 study medication applications. One subject achieved complete clearance of the Target Wart during the investigation, and data from this pilot s tudy demonstrated a statistically significant trend towards clearing warts in the A -101 40% group when compared with the vehicle. It was the Investigator's opinion that \"1 or 2 additional treatments may clear the warts as most A -101 40% treated warts were \"Near Clear\" at the end of the four -week study\". The administration of A -101 40% over four applications one week apart showed no untoward effects and the treatment was well tolerated by all subjects. The data and clinical observations suggest that a larger study allowing greater than four drug applications and evaluating additional doses of A -101 topical solution are warranted. 2.2. Study Rationale A phase 2 clinical trial was conducted in which subjects were randomized to receive A -101 40%, A-101 45% or Vehic le for the treatment of common warts. Study A -101-WART -201 randomized a total of 98 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of common warts. Subjects received up to 8 weekly treatments with A -101 study medication. The primary and secondary efficacy endpoint s of the mean change from baseline to Visit 10 on the Physician Wart Assessment (PWA) and the proportion of PWA responders at Visit 10, which was defined as target warts judged to be clear or to be clear or mild, demonstrated superiority of A-101 45%, but not 40%, versus vehicle. Both concentrations of A -101 evaluated were well tolerated. The only TEAEs considered to be treatment -related were application site pain for 2 subjects (all events were considered to be mild and resolved on the same day without i ntervention) and chlamydial infection for 1 subject. There were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital signs. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 16 of Amendment Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 A-101 solution 45% demonstrated superiority versus the matching A -101 solution vehicle (and A-101 4 0%) in physician evaluations of efficacy in treating target warts on the trunk or extremities and was well tolerated with occurrence of local skin reactions that were generally transient. Based on these results a phase 2 study comparing A -101 45% vs Vehic le is warranted. 3. OBJECTIVES 3.1. Study Objectives 3.1.1. Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of A-101 45% compared to vehicle when applied to 1 common t arget wart on the trunk or extremities. 3.1.2.

The used applicators will be weighed again after all warts have been treated. The weight of the applicators will be documented in the subject's eCRF. Sites will be supplied with a scale to weigh each applicator. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 26 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 7.6. Study Medication Treatment The study medications are for external, topical use on the Target and Non -Target Warts on the appropriate study subject only. The investigational center staff member must comply with the study medication storage conditions outlined in Section 7.1. At Visit 2, the investigational study staff will select the appropriate study medication applicator for treatment of a specific subject. Subject s ages 18 years of age and older will apply the appropriately labeled A -101 study medicat ion to all Target and Non -Target Warts in the presence of the treating investigator or investigational staff that has been trained on the protocol. Investigational study staff will apply A -101 study medication to subjects between the ages of 8 and 17. At Visit 3-9, any Target or Non -Target Wart that has a PWA grade of >0 and ONLY Target Wart s or Non-Target Warts that have a P WA grade of >0 , must receive study medication treatment UNLESS either of the following criteria apply to the Target or Non -Targe t Wart : The Target or the Non -Target Wart has a pre-treatment LSR grade of 3 (severe) for any sign or symptom AND the grade has increased compared to the previous visit. The Target or the Non -Target Wart is, in the investigator's opinion, not appropriate f or a retreatment (the investigator must note the reason on the subject's Comments CRF page). The Target or the Non -Target Wart, in the Investigator's opinion, cannot be visualized so the Investigator cannot assess the PWA. Following treatment with the A -101 study medication applicator, all used applicator s must be disposed of in a biohazardous container. 7.6.1. Preparing the Study Medication for Application To perform a study medication treatment for Target and Non -Target Wart s a staff member will select the appropriate study medication applicator. The following instructions outline the procedure for application of the study medication to the Target and Non -Target Warts : Investigational Study Staff member will p repare the A -101 study medication applicator for all subjects, regardless of age by: o Washing their hands prior to, and after completing the study medication treatments o Wear safety glasses and nitrile or vinyl examination gloves during the treatment; latex gloves are prohibited o Complete the study medica tion applicator label as instructed o Visually inspect the applicator for damage: If the applicator appears damaged do not use it for the treatment, contact the study monitor for disposal instructions and select an other unused applicator for treatment . Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 27 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 If the applicator is intact, proceed with the applicator preparation process as outlined in Figure 1. Step 1: Hold the Study Medication Step 2: Crush the ampule in the applicator so that the applicator applicator by applying pressure at cap is pointing up. the center of the barrel of the applicator . Step 3: Remove the cardboard Step 4: Tap the barrel of the applicator sleeve. to ensure the solution is free of the crushed ampule. Target Warts should be cleaned using an alcohol wipe prior to application of A -101 Solution or matching Vehicle Solution . Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 28 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 Step 5: Gently remove the cap Step 6: Express a single drop of by twisting while pulling away the Study Medication Topical Solution from the applicator. so that the tip of the applicator becomes wet. Figure 1: Diagram Showing the Process for Preparing A -101 Study Medication 7.6.2. Applying Study Medication to Target and Non -Target Warts on the Trunk and Extremities Subjects that are between the ages of 8 and 17 will have their A -101 study medication applied by the investigational study staff and the staff will follow the application process outlined below for all Target and Non -Target Warts. Subjects 18 years of age and older will apply their A -101 study medication to his/her identified Target and Non -Target Warts in the presence of the treating physician or member of the investigational staff. The following instructions will be used by a ll individuals applying A -101 study medication to all Target and Non -Target Warts: Do not apply the study medications to eyes, nose, mouth, mucous membranes, or open wounds Thoroughly cleanse the Target and Non -Target Warts by firmly rubbing with a swab /wipe wetted with 70% isopropyl alcohol Using firm pressure and with the tip of the applicator held over the wart , squeez e in the middle of the applicator to apply one drop of study medication onto the Target Wart. Using the smaller side of the applicator tip, move the applicator around in a circular motion to fully saturate the lesion. Apply the study medication for approximately 15 seconds. Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin During the treatment process remove excess study medication fro m the surrounding skin using a clean absorbent wipe Ensure that each identified wart is fully saturated with study medication at the end of the ~15 second application Allow the treated wart to remain undisturbed for ~ 15 seconds Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 29 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 After ~ 15 seconds repeat the ~15 second application process Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study med ication has been applied to each identified Wart up to 3 times. Document the number of times each identified wart is treated during a treatment Visit. After all ident ified warts have been treated , the subject must be instructed not to disturb any of the treated warts u ntil just prior to the post -application LSR evaluation . Just prior to the post -application LSR evaluation the investigational study staff should absorb any remaining A-101 study medication and dry the Target and Non -Target Wart s and the surrounding skin without wiping or rubbing It is acceptable to treat multiple Target /Non -Target Warts at the same time if, in the investigator's opinion, it is practic al without exposing non -lesional skin to the study medication . 7.7. Dose modification If a subject refuses to allow a study medication initial treatment or retreatment the investigator must report the visit number, visit date, Target Wart number(s) the subjec t refused to allow treatment for and the reason for the refusal in the subject's CRF . If the subject's refusal is associated with an AE, the investigator must also report the event on the appropriate CRF . Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 7.8. Previous and Concomitant Therapies 7.8.1. Previous ther apies During Visit 1, the investigator or designee will question the subject to ensure they have not used any excluded therapies within the specified period prior to Visit 1 to any of the Target or Non - Target Wart s: Intralesional Therapy o Immunotherapy (e. g., Candida antigen, antigen, Trichophyton antigen) 8 weeks o Anti-metabolite therapy ( e.g., bleomycin, 5 -fluorouracil); 8 weeks Systemic Therapy o Immunomodulatory/immunosuppressant therapy (e.g., etanercept, alefacept, infliximab); 16 weeks o Glucocortic o-steroi ds (inhaled and intra -nasal steroids are permitted); 28 days Topical Therapy o LASER (e.g., pulsed -dye laser [PDL], light (e.g. , intense photodynamic therapy other Anti-metabolite therapy (e.g ., 5-fluorouracil); 8 weeks o Retinoids; 90 days o Liquid nitrogen, electrodesiccation, curettage; 60 days o Over -the-counter (OTC) wart therapies; 28 days 7.8.2. Concomitant therapi es Concomitant therapies are any new or existing therapy received from Visit 1 until discharge from the study. Concomitant therapies include drug ( e.g., prescription, over -the-counter [OTC]) and non -drug ( e.g., chiropractic, physical therapy, energy -based treatments) therapies. Subjects will refrain from using any prohibited therapies in compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects should refrain from changing the use of any concomitant therapies during the study. All new or modified conco mitant therapies used during the study must be recorded in the subject CRF . 7.8.3. Prohibited therapies During the course of this study, subjects are prohibited from using the following treatment therapies to treat any of the Target or Non -Target Warts : Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 31 of Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 ., bleomycin, infliximab); Glucocortico -steriods (inhaled and intra -nasal are permitted); Topical Therapy o LASER (e.g., pulsed -dye laser [PDL], (e.g. , intense o Liquid nitrogen, curettage; o Over -the-count er (OTC) wart therapies; The investigator should notify the Medical Monitor immediat ely if any prohibited therapies are required to ensure subject safety. Starting with Visit 2, subjects must not apply any topical products ( e.g., moisturizers, sunscreens, etc.) to their Target or Non -Target Warts within 12 hours prior to any study visit (Note: routine cleansing products are allowed). After the completion of any study visit where a study medication treatment was performed subjects must NOT wash/submerge the Target or Non -Target Wart s for at least 6 hours and must not apply any topical pro ducts to the Target or Non -Target Warts for at least 6 hours . 7.9. Breaking the Blind The blind may be broken ONLY in the event of a medical emergency, in which knowledge of the study medication identity is critical to the management of the subject's course of treatment. Before breaking the blind the investigator should determine that the information is necessary. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not study medication -related, the problem may be effectively managed by assuming that the subject is receiving an active study medication without the need for unblinding. If deemed necessary to break the blind for a study subject, attempt to contact the Medical Monitor to obtain permission to break the blind of a particular subject . If it is not possible to contact the Medical Monitor beforehand, contact her/him as soon as possible after breaking the blind for a subject. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 32 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 To identify a subject's study medication, locate the second panel of the tear -off label from the Subject Kit attached t o the subject's Label Page CRF and follow the instructions on the label. Record the date of un -blinding, the reason for the un -blinding and the initials of investigational center staff member who performed the un -blinding on the subject's Label Page CRF. At the end of the study, the original Label Page CRFs will be returned to Aclaris Therapeutics with a photocopy place d in the investigator's study file. The or iginal Label Page CRFs will be available, upon request, to the site if needed to respond to a regulatory inspection . 8. ASSESSMENTS OF CLINICAL EFFICACY 8.1. Target and Non -Target Wart Identification At Visit 1, the investigator will identify one Target Wart and up to 3 additional Non-Target Warts on the trunk or extremities for each subject for treatm ent and evaluation. For this study, the trunk and extremities are defined as: The front and back of the torso from the clavicle to the hips, including the buttocks and excluding the genitals and anus The arms from the shoulder to the fingertips, excluding periungual and subungual areas The legs from the hip to the ankles (including the dorsal side of the foot) . At Visit 1, each Target and Non -Target Wart must: Have a longest axis that is 3mm and 8mm Have a thickness 3mm Be a discrete lesion Be, when centered in the circular cutout of the provided template, the only common wart present (Refer to Figure 2) Not be periun gual, subungual, genital , anal, mosaic, plantar, flat or filiform. Not be covered with hair which, in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with the study medication treatments or the study evaluations Not be in an area that may be occluded ( e.g., by clothing or footwear or in a skin fold). Record the location of the Target and Non -Target Wart on the body charts in the CRFs indicating landmarks and distances to assist with confirming the location of the Target and Non -Target Wart s Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 At Visit 1, the Investigator and an investigational staff member will identify each Target and Non-Target Wart by placing 2 identification (ID) stickers approximately 180 degrees opposite each other with the identified w art in the center of the area outlined by the provided circular template (diagram not to scale): ID Sticker 23mm diameter template cutout Target /Non ID Sticker Figure 2 Target /Non -Target Wart Identification At Visits 2 -13, an investigational staff member (other than the evaluating investigator) will confirm the location of each Target /Non -Target Wart using an appropriate combination of the Visit 1 hard -copy reference prints, Visit 2 photographs and the body charts. The staff member will identify the Target /Non -Target Warts by placing 2 appropriate ly colored ID stickers, with the Target /Non -Target Wart number written on one sticker, approximately 180 degrees opposite each other with the identified wart in the center of area outlined by the provided circular template. 8.2. Standardized photography At Vis its 1, 2 , 4, 9, 10, and 13 a qualified inve stigational center staff member will take standardized color photographs of each Target and Non -Target Wart . The photographs are to document the appearance and location of the subjects' Target and Non - Target Warts. The subject's identity will not be revealed in the study photographs. At Visit 2, the photographs must be taken prior to the study medication application . Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, background, subject positioning relative to the camera and camera settings are used for each photograph. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 34 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 Sites will be provided with photography e quipment and s upplies necessary for obtaining the Target Lesion photographs. D etailed instructions for obtaining and managin g the photographs will be docu mented in the study specific Photography Manual and provided to the site at the study initiation visit. 8.3. Physician's Wart Assessment (PWA) The Physician's Wart Assessment (PWA) is the Investigator's assessment of the severity of each Target and Non -Target Wart at a particular time point. The Investigator should NOT refer to any other assessments to assist with this evaluation. This evaluation IS NOT a comparison with the PWA at any other visit. At every study visit, the Investigator will assess the Targe t and Non -Target Wart s and report the one integer that best describes the Target and Non -Target Wart severity using the following scale. At any visit where a study medication treatment is performed, the PWA must be completed prior to the treatment. Physic ian's Wart Assessment Grade Descri ptor 0 Clear: No visible wart. No further treatment is indicated 1 Near Clear: A visible wart that is less than 3mm in maximal diameter (or length) 2 A visible wart 3mm and <6 mm in maximal diameter (or length) 3 A visible wart 6mm in maximal diameter (or length) At Visit 1 for the subject to be enrolled and at Visit 2 for the subject to be randomized each Target and Non -Target Wart must have a PWA grade 2. At Visits 3 -9, Target and Non -Target Warts must h ave a PWA > 0 to be retreated. If the Investigator cannot assess the PWA for a Target or Non -Target Wart ( e.g., the Target /Non - Target Wart cannot be visualized because of an LSR such as edema, scabbing, etc.) she/he must report the in the subject's CRFs. The Target /Non -Target Wart must not be retreated at that visit, and the subject should be seen at the next scheduled visit. 8.4. Subject Instructions An investigational center staff member will dispense a Subject Instruction Sheet to each subject at Visi t 1 (Refer to Appendix 15.1). Throughout the study, the subjects should: Continue their routine cleansing regimen except they should avoid vigorous scrubbing of the Target /Non -Target Warts (e.g., loofah, back b rushes, scrubbing straps, abrasive washcloths, sponges and cleansing pads, etc.) Continue their routine cosmetics and skin care products Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 35 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 Avoid exposing the Target /Non -Target Warts to excessive natural or artificial ultraviolet radiation ( e.g., sunlight, ta nning beds) and use sunscreen on the Target /Non -Target Warts , if excessive exposure cannot be avoided Avoid activities that might irritate the Target /Non -Target Wart Avoid the use of self -tanning lotions and spray tans. Bring the subject instruction sheet with them to each visit. On study visit days, the subjects should: When appropriate for the Target /Non -Target Wart location wear loose fitting clothing to the visit (Note: clothing that comes in contact with the study medication may be bleached) Starting with Visit 2, not apply any topical products to the Target /Non -Target Wart within 12 hours prior to the visit (Note: routine cleansing products are allowed) After the completion of any study visit where a study medication treatment was performed DO NOT: o Wash/submerge the Target or Non -Target Warts for at least 6 hours o Apply any topical products to the Target or Non -Target Warts for at least 6 hours . 8.5. Other Study Supplies Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide: An appropriate ruler, or other instrument, for measuring the thickness of all Target /Non - Target Wart s dimensions Templates for use when identifying Target /Non -Target Wart s Supplies and instructions for collecting, labeling, shipping and result reporting for the clinical laboratory tests and urine pregn ancy tests from a third party Equipment, supplies and training for taking standardized photographs Scales to weigh all treatment applicators Eyewash kits. 9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY In addition to reporting adverse events throughout the study the investigator, a designated and appropriately trained staff member or the subject, will perform the following safety assessments according to the schedules noted below. The investigational staff member performing the LSR evaluations must not participate in the study medi cation treatment for the subject being evaluated. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 36 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 9.1. Local Skin Reactions (LSR) The LSR assessment is the Investigator's assessment of the signs and the subject's assessment of the symptoms associated with irritation at the Target /Non -Target Wart site ( i.e., the Target /Non - Target Wart and the skin immediately surrounding the Target /Non -Target Wart exposed to study medication). The Investigator may refer to previous photographs to assist with these assessments only after the PWA has been performed. The Local S kin Reaction signs to be assessed are: Erythema Edema Erosion Ulceration Vesicles/bullae Excoriations Scabbing. The Local Skin Reaction symptoms to be assessed (by the Subject) are: Stinging/burning Pruritus (itch). At Visits 2 -13, the Investigator will evaluate the LSR signs at the Target /Non -Target Wart site(s) as follows: At visits where a study medication treatment or retreatment is performed: o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application o For treated Target and Non -Target Warts p erform an LSR assessment 20 (\u00b14) minutes after the Treatment Completion Time. At Visits 2 -13, the Subject will assess the LSR symptoms at the Target/Non -Target Wart site(s) as follows: At visits where a study medication treatment or retreatment is perform ed: o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application o For every treated Target and Non -Target Wart site, 10 (\u00b14) minutes after the Treatment Completion Time, report the average of the severity of the LSR for all symptoms since completion of the study medication treatment. At visits where no study medication treatment is performed: o Perform an LSR assessment. The Investigator and subject should report the one integer that best describes the severity of each LSR sign or LSR symptom for the Target and Non -Target Wart site s using the scale below. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 37 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 Local Skin Reactions Grade Descriptor 0 None 1 Mild 2 Moderate 3 Severe 9.2. Vital signs Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 9 and Visit 13 . The following ite ms will be measured: Body temperature Pulse rate Respiration rate Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 minutes Height (at Visit 1 only) Weight (at Visit 1 only). Any measure that is, in the opinion of the i nvestigator, abnormal AND clinically significant (CS must be recorded as history if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if found after the first study medication treatment begins (Section 10.1). A systolic blood pressure >140mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure >90mm Hg is considered abnormal and therefore must be defined as CS or not clinically significant (NCS ) on the CRFs. 9.3. Clinical laboratory sampling Non-fasting blood samples for clinical laboratory analysis will be collected by a qualified staff member at Visit 1 , Visit 9 and Visit 13 . Approximately 7.5 mL of blood will be collected for each chemistry sample and 3 ml of blood will be collected for the complete blood count (CBC) . These blood samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for instructions regarding handling of the blood samples and shipping instructions. The following tests, at a minimum, will be conducted : Chemistry Panel Complete Blood Count Albumin Hematocrit (AST) Red blood cell morphology Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Red blood cell count Bicarbo nate White blood cell count Calcium White blood cell differential Chloride % & absolute Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 38 of Total protein Uric acid The results of the clinical laboratory tests will be reported on the central laboratory's standard reports. These laboratory results will be sent to the investigator via fax. The investigator must review all la boratory reports in a timely manner and note NC S or C S to define the clinical relevance of any result that is outside the normal range for the laboratory. The investigator must date and initial every laboratory report. The investigator must review the Vi sit 1 laboratory results for all the measured analytes for each subject prior to Visit 2. The subject must not be randomized at Visit 2 if any of the Visit 1 results are outside normal range for the laboratory AND, in the opinion of the investigator, C S. The investigator must report all laboratory results that are BOTH outside the normal range for the laboratory AND, in the opinion of the investigator, C S as medical history if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if found after t he first study medication treatment begins. 9.4. Urine pregnancy tests The investigator or designee will perform a urine pregnancy test for subjects who are WOCBP at Visit 1, at Visit 2 prior to randomization , Visit 9 and Visit 13 . Subjects who are WOCBP mu st have a negative pregnancy test result at Visit 1 to continue in the study and at Visit 2 to be randomized. If the result of any post -randomization urine pregnancy test is positive, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and the subject's pregnanc y documented and followed as outlined in Section 11. 9.5. Other Evaluations 9.5.1. Demographics and medical history At Visit 1, the investigator or designee will collect demographic information including date of birth, sex at birth , race and, if appropriate, ethnicity for each subject. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 39 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 At Visit 1, the investigator must determine each subject's Fitzpatrick skin type and document appropriately on the subject's CRF. Table 3 Fitzpatrick Skin Type Sco ring System Skin Type Classification Description Type I always burns, never tans (pale white; blond or red hair; blue eyes; freckles) Type II usually burns, tans minimally (white; fair; blond or red hair; blue, green, or hazel eyes) Type III sometimes m ild burn, tans uniformly (cream white; fair with any hair or eye color) Type IV burns minimally, always tans well (moderate brown) Type V very rarely burns, tans very easily (dark brown) Type VI Never burns, never tans (deeply pigmented dark brown to da rkest brown) (Fitzpatrick 1988) Medical history information will be recorded including all medical conditions and disease states that, at Visit 1: Are ongoing Require concomitant therapy Are, in the opinion of the investigator, relevant to the subject's study participation. 9.5.2. Standardized photography At Visits 1, 2 , 4, 9, 10 and 13 , a qualified investigational center staff member, other than the investigator, will take standardized color photographs of each Target and Non -Target Wart . The photographs are to document the location of the Target and Non -Target Wart s and to assist with relocating the Target /Non -Target Wart s. Th e Target /Non -Target Wart ID stickers must be visible in the photographs. The subject's identity will not be revealed in the study pho tographs. At Visit 2, the photographs must be taken prior to the study medication treatment. Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, background, and subject positioning relative to the camera and camera settings are used for each photograph. Equipment, supplies, training and detailed instructions for obtaining and managing the photographs will be provided to the investigational center prior to the initiation of subject enrollment. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 40 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 10. ADVERSE EVENTS 10.1. Definitions 10.1.1. Adverse events (AE) An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study of a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. An adverse event can, there fore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under study (or any concurrent disease), whether or not con sidered related to the study drug. Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following: intercurrent illnesses physical injuries events possibly related to concomitant medication significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency ) of the disease under study or other pre -existing conditions. (N OTE: A condition, recorded as pre -existing, that is intermittently symptomatic [e.g., headache] and which occurs during the study should be recorded as an adverse event.) drug interactions events occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities occurring after the start of the study (i.e., after screening and once confirmed by repeat testing) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or is considered by the study investigator to be clinically significant. NOTE: Abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events, but will be recorded to monitor data from patients who do not meet screening criteria. Worsening of any of the Target or Non -Target Wart assessments should be reported as an AE ONLY if the use of the study medication is interrupted or discontinued or if therapy is required to manage the event. The investigator must, for any Target or Non -Target Wart related AE, question the subject in detail to determine if there are any confou nding factors ( e.g., irritation by clothing or activity, sunburn) for any such AE. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 41 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwi se, signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE. Any C S abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication treatment should be reported as medical history, not as an AE. 10.1.2. Serious adverse event (SAE) A Serious Adver se Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: Results in death Is life threatening Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, Is a congenital a nomaly/birth defect or Is an important medical event. The term \"life threatening\" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject is admitted to the hospital on an in -patient basis, even if released the same day. Prolongation of hospitalization is defined as an additional night stay in the hospital . Hospi talization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death or hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. 10.1.3. Adverse event reporting period The investigator must start reporting non -serious AEs starting with the subject's first study medica tion tr eatment continuing until Visit 1 1. Non -serious adverse events that occur between the time the subject was consent ed and the first application of study medication will be reported as medical history. Reporting for SAEs begins after the subject sig ns the informed con sent and continues until Visit 11 (regardless of relationship to study medication). If a subject experiences a SAE after Visit 11 that is deemed by the investigator to be related to study medication, the investigator must report this to the Sponsor using the study specific SAE report form. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 42 of Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 10.1.4. Severity The investigator must define the severity of each AE using the following definitions as a guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and ident ify the severity that is the most appropriate according to her/his medical judgment. Mild - Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated Moderate - Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity Severe - Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity. 10.1.5. Relationship to study medication The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and consider al l relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject's relevant medical history, concomitant therapies and concurrent conditions) to determine the relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define t he relationship of an AE to the study medication by selecting one of the following categories: Related - There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE. Not Related - There is not a reasonabl e possibility that there is a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE. The term \"reasonable causal relationship\" means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A). 10.2. Reporting Procedures 10.2.1. Procedures for reporting adverse events At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will question the subject to elicit AEs using a non -directive question such as \"Has there been any change in your health since the previous study visit?\" The Investigator/designee will monitor the subject for at least 20 minutes after the Treatment Completion Time at any visit during which a study medication treatment is performed to elicit AEs in a similar manner. If appropriate, ba sed on the subject's response to non -directed questioning regarding AEs, the investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations. Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents an d on the appropriate AE CRF. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 AEs that are defined as \"Not Related\" to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or until the subject's last study visit. AEs that are defined as \"Related\" to the study medications will be followed unti l they are resolved or, if not resolved after the subject's last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator, the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae. 10.2.2. Procedure for reporting a serious adverse event Upon becoming awar e of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or not related to the study medications, the investigator must: 1. Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject's safety 2. Immediately inform th e Medical Monitor of the SAE: Evyan Cord -Cruz, MD Symbio 484 -324-2359 Email: ecruz@symbioresearch.com 3. Within 24 -hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CR F and any other relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, laboratory test results) must be faxed to the SAE Fax line listed above. 4. Monitor and document the progress of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after t he subject's last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae AND the investigator and Medical Monitor agree that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved. 5. Inform the Medical Monitor o f SAE updates by telephone followed by an SAE form update sent by fax or by e -mail. 6. Comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. instructions regarding reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC). 10.2.3. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from study drug at any time at the discretion of the investigator. If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time. The patient will be monitored until the event has resolved or stabilized, until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study pr ocedure is made, or until the patient is referred to the care of a local health care professional. The investigator must inform Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 44 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 the medical monitor as soon as possible of all patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additio nal reports must be provided when requested . 11. PREGNANCY WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization ( e.g., hysterectomy, hysteroscopy, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral tomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. Women who are WOCBP and are using an active method of birth control, are practicing abstinence or where the partner is sterile ( e.g., vasectomy), should be considered to be WOCBP. All WOCBP must use an active method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for a pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent /assent form documenting this discussion. During the trial, all WOCBP will be instructed to contact the investigato r immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant ( e.g., missed or late menstrual period). If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study medication administration, the study medication must be withheld until the results of a pregnancy test are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study medication and must be discharged from the study. If, following study medication administration, it is determined that the subject may have been or was pregnant at the time of study medication exposure (including at least 2 days after study medication administration) the investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor and record the event on a pregnancy surveillance form. While not an AE or S AE, the investigator must report every pregnancy using a pregnancy surveillance form and follow the reporting procedures described for SAE reporting (Section 10.2.2 ). Protocol -required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy ( e.g., x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the investigator must report to the Medical Monitor on th e pregnancy surveillance form, follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed for a minimum of six weeks. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 45 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 12.1. Sample Size and Power Considerati on Based on efficacy results from the previous study and the active study medication specified in the current protocol for the same indication , sample size for the current study is anticipated to provide greater than 90% power to achieve statistical significanc e in the primary efficacy analysis. 12.2. Statistical Analysis of Efficacy Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be performed on the Per -Protocol population, defined as all randomized subjects who missed no more than 3 treatment visits, completed Visit 10 (primary analysis) and Visit 13 (secondary analysis) , and who have not had a major protocol violation over that time period, including the use of a clinically relevant quantity of a prohibited medication as determined by the study Medical Monitor. No missing data imputation will be used for these analyses. Visit 10 is considered to be the pri mary efficacy endpoint. In addition, some analyses wi ll also be conducted at earlier and subsequent visits , and treated as exploratory analyses. Some sensitiv ity efficacy analyses may also be re -performed on the Intent to Treat population, defined as those randomized subjects who have at least one post -baseline visit with required efficacy data collection and who completed Visit 10 with required collection of e fficacy data. For those analyses, missing efficacy data for intermediate visits will be imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) procedure. A determination as to the performance of analyses using the Intent to Treat population will be ba sed on t he number and pattern of visits missed by randomized subjects. Exploratory analy ses using models specified below may also be performed for separate age groups, depending on enrollment outcomes. For all analyses, two -tail alpha will be set to 0.05 with no adjustment for multiple comparisons. ANOVAs and ANCOVAs will include Site in the model only if doing so improves the sensitivity of the model for comparing treatment groups. After the last randomized subject has completed Visit 10 the database w ill be validated, locked through Visit 10 and unbli nded for the purpose of analyzing efficacy data through Visit 10. Those analyses are not considered to be interim analyses as the results will be final. Data will continue to be collected through Visit 1 3 for all subjects, and the full database will subsequently be locked for efficacy analysis ( including durabili ty of response) beyond Visit 10, and for the analysis of safety and all other clinical data. The primary efficacy analysis will be a comparison between treatment groups based on the mean change in Target Wart PWA from Baseline (Visit 2) to Visit 10, using Analysis of Covariance with Baseline PWA as the covariate. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 46 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 Secondary efficacy analyses will include comparisons between treatment groups base d on the following: the proportion of subjects with the Target Wart Clear (PWA = 0) at Visit 10 using Fisher's Exact Test; the proportion of subjects with all treated warts Clear at Visit 10 using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by number of tre ated warts; and the mean of per -subject percentages of treated warts that are clear at Visit 10 using Analysis of Variance. The number of treated warts Clear at Visit 10 will also be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by number of tre ated warts. Durability of response in the Active treatment group will be evaluated by calculating the proportion of tho se treated warts achieving a PWA status of Clear at Visit 10 which continue to maintain a PWA status of Clear at Visit 13. This analy sis will be performed separately for Target Warts, and for all treated warts. The 95% confidence limits around the calculated proportions will also be calculated in order to estimate the population lower limit value of the observed sample proportions. Exploratory analyses will be conducted using a subset of the above analysis models, based on the following baseline wart classifications: warts that are determined to be tr eatment -naive vs. recalcitrant. 12.3. Statistical Analysis of Safety Data Descriptive sta tistics will be calculated on the safety parameters using the ITT population. The proportion of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events will be tabulated and presented by treatment and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Or gan Class. Vital signs, LSR scores and clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results will also be tabulated and presented by study medication. No inferential testing will be performed. Data from all randomized subjects will be presented and summarized. Safety summaries by study medication group will include listings by study medication of adverse events incidences within each MedDRA System Organ Class, and changes from pre-application values in vital signs. Adverse event summaries will be presented by study medication showing the proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events, both overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class. 12.4. Interim Analysis An interim Analysis will not be conducted for this study. 13. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 13.1. Protocol Ame ndments No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IEC/IRB, except when necessary to eliminate immediate safety concerns to the study subjects or when the change involves only logistics or administration. The principal investigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment . Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 47 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 13.2. Protocol Deviations, Violations and Exceptions A protocol deviation is non -adherence to protocol -specific study pr ocedures or schedules that does not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, and/or GCP guidelines. Deviations are considered minor and do not impact the study. Deviations include study procedures that occurred outside the treatment windows (except for treatment application days) . A protocol violation is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, subject is administered a p rohibited medication , primary objective variable criteria , and/or GCP guidelines . Protocol violations will be identified and recorded, by study center personnel, on the CRF. As a matter of policy, sponsor/CRO will not grant exceptions to protocol -specific entry criteria to allow patients to enter a study. If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular patient, prior approval from sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the Sponsor/CROs Standard Operating Pro cedure (SOP), is required before the patient will be allowed to enter the study. If investigative center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol eligibility criteria was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they must immediately inf orm sponsor/CRO. Such subjects will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare instance following review and written approval by sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP . 13.3. Training For each investigational center, ther e will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study subjects. It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study coordinators or other applicable personnel attend this visit. During this visit, participants wi ll be trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs. Those unable to attend the initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appropriately trained individual prior to participating in any of the procedures and evaluations in t his study. Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the protocol and other study specific items. Team org anization, communication and operational issues will also be discussed. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide an investigational center file to each center. 13.4. Monitoring The conduct of the study will be closely monitored by the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. study monitor /CRO to verify adherence to ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable SOPs, the protocol, other written instructions and regulatory guidelines. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 48 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 The investigator will allow the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. representatives design ee and/or and any regulatory agency to have direct access to all study records, CRFs, corresponding subject medical records, study medication dispensing records and study medication storage area, and any other documents considered source documentation. Th e investigator also agrees to assist the representative, if required . 13.5. Data Management Data will be collected using eCRFs that are specifically designed for this study. The data collected on the eCRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the technical requirements described in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11. The CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical requirements of the study before it is used to c apture data from this study. Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study specific training. After they are trained, users will be provided with individual system access rights. The handling of data, including data quali ty assurance, will comply with regulatory guidelines, including ICH and GCP, and the sponsor/CRO SOPs and working instructions. Data management and control processes specific to this study will be described in a data management plan. At the end of the study, the database will be locked and the data will be released for reporting and statistical analysis 13.6. Quality Assurance The study is conducted under the sponsorship of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements a s well as applicable ICH guidelines, Helsinki Declaration, and in respect of the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and/or sub -contractor SOPs for study conduct and monitoring. Audits may be carried out by the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or Aclaris Therapeutics, In c.'s representatives and inspections may be performed by regulatory authorities or IRB/ECs before, during or after the study. The investigator will provide the auditing/inspecting group direct access to all study records ( e.g., CRFs, subject medical recor ds, study medication dispensing records) and the investigational center study facilities. The investigator and study staff will be available and will assist the auditing/inspecting groups as appropriate. 13.7. Record Retention All pertinent data, samples, photo graphs, correspondence, original or amended protocol, reports and all other material relating to the study will be maintained securely in Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc./CRO /investigator archives for the legally required duration for archiving. The investigator should maintain the essential study documents as specified in ICH GCP, and in compliance with all regulatory requirements. The investigator should ensure these documents are protected from accidental destruction or disposal. If the Investigator needs to r e-assign responsibility for maintaining these documents ( e.g., due to retirement) it must be transferred to a person willing to accept this responsibility. The investigator must notify Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., in writing, of the name and address of the new individual. Protocol: A -101-WART -202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Page 49 of 53 Amendment 2 Version 3 Date: 05 December 2017 If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigative site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor to store these in sealed containers in an off-site storage location so that they can be returned to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies will be made for off -site storage. No trial document s hould be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. Should the Investigator wish to assign the trial records to another party or move them to another location, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location 14. ETHICS AND GENERAL STUDY CONDUCT CONSIDERATIONS 14.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Ethics Committee (EC) This protocol and any accompanying material, including information that will be provided to prospectiv e patients (such as advertisements, patient information sheets, or study descriptions used to induce study participation or obtain informed consent /assent ) must be submitted to the Central IRB for approval . Approval of each such submission must be obtaine d from the committee before it may be used in the study and must be documented in a written notification to the Investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. In particular, each informed consent /assent document must bear clear evidence (written, stamp, date of approval, etc.) of IRB approval before it may be presented to prospective (or ongoing, as appropriate) study patients for signature. Written evidence o f the approval must be made available to the Sponsor. Any modifications made to the protocol and of correspondingly modified informed consent /assent documents made after receipt of Central IRB approval must also be submitted to the committee for approval before implementation unless the modification is made on an emergency basis to protect the welfare of study patients. In the latter case, the Central IRB must be notified promptly and their written approval must be obtained as soon after the fact as possi ble. Appropriate reports on the progress of the study will be made to the Central IRB and the Sponsor by the Investigator in accordance with applicable regulatory regulations and in conformity with policies established by both the Central IRB and the Spons or. The shortest time interval between required reports required by either party or by regulations will prevail. The Investigator at each investigative site, or his/her nominee, will be responsible for reporting any SAEs to the Central IRB as soon as poss ible, and in accordance with the guidelines of the Central IRB. The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting all serious, life threatening or fatal adverse study drug events with a causal relationship to the study drug to appropriate regulatory agencies w ithin their required timelines.
