MPX causes an illness that lasts about two to four weeks \u2014 most people recover fully at home without the need for medical treatment. However, children, people with compromised immune systems, or people with severe disease may need treatment. If you have MPX symptoms, talk to your provider about testing and care. [Visit the CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/if-sick/index.html) to learn more about what to do if you have MPX. MPX vaccines: We have limited supplies for eligible patients with an order from a provider. Visit the [San Bernardino](https://wp.sbcounty.gov/dph/monkeypox/) and [Riverside](https://www.rivcoph.org/mpx/Vaccine-Locations) county websites for more vaccination locations. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF MPX? MPX causes a rash that can appear on or near the genitals, anus, hands, feet, chest, face, or mouth. Either before or after the rash appears, you may also experience some or all of the following symptoms: - Fever - Chills - Swollen lymph nodes - Exhaustion - Muscle aches and backache - Headache - Respiratory symptoms (e.g. sore throat, nasal congestion, or cough) Symptoms usually start within three weeks of exposure. If you've been exposed and start having flu-like symptoms, you will most likely develop a rash within four days. Find more detailed information on the CDC's [MPX symptoms page](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms/index.html). HOW IS MPX TREATED? While there are no specific treatments for MPX, certain antiviral drugs and vaccines may help prevent illness after exposure or progression to severe illness after infection. These may be recommended if you have other health conditions that make you more likely to get severely ill (such as a weakened immune system). Most people will recover fully in about two to four weeks at home. As much as possible, people with MPX should: - Avoid contact with people and animals - Wear a mask and cover rashes while around people or animals - Disinfect objects and surfaces others may also touch - Limit outside activities and practice physical distancing HOW DOES MPX SPREAD? CAN IT BE PREVENTED? MPX spreads through physical contact with someone who's infected, their body fluids, and objects or surfaces they've touched. It may also spread through prolonged face-to-face contact. You can prevent infection by avoiding contact with people who have MPX and any objects or surfaces they've touched. MPX can also be prevented by the JYNNEOS and ACAM2000 vaccines \u2014 learn about vaccine eligibility on the [San Bernardino County](https://wp.sbcounty.gov/dph/monkeypox/) or [Riverside County](https://www.rivcoph.org/mpx/Vaccine-Locations) websites.

It's not known how much MPX can affect a fetus or newborn \u2014 both healthy pregnancies and cases with complications have been reported. If you have MPX symptoms, talk to your provider as soon as possible. "}
