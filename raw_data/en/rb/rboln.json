Listing a study does not mean it has been evaluated by the U.S. Federal Government. Read our | |ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00078195| | | Recruitment Status : Completed First Posted : February 20, 2004 Last Update Posted : October 18, 2016 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT00078195) [No Results Posted](/ct2/show/results/NCT00078195) Allergic rhinitis affects 20 to 40 million Americans annually. Allergy symptoms, which can range from mild to seriously debilitating, may affect quality of life. Left untreated, allergic rhinitis can exacerbate or trigger more serious conditions, such as asthma and sinus inflammation. Individuals with allergies react to harmless particles such as dust or pollen. Proteins in the blood called IgE antibodies treat the harmless particles as invaders and trigger an immune system response. The immune response results in harmful inflammation of healthy tissues. In ragweed allergy, inflammation occurs in the airways and causes familiar allergy symptoms like sneezing, coughing, and general discomfort. Omalizumab is an investigational drug that has been shown to block the effects of IgE antibodies. The blocking effect of omalizumab is temporary, but giving the drug to people before their regular allergy shots may make the shots more effective. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive injections of omalizumab or a placebo before an accelerated course of allergy shots (given over 12 weeks). The participants will return for follow-up for up to one year, and they may have as many as 27 study visits. |Study pre-treated with omalizumab followed by ragweed rush immunotherapy (RIT) followed by dual therapy with omalizumab plus ragweed immunotherapy (IT). | Biological: omalizumab | A minimum equivalent dose of 0.016 mg/kg/IgE (IU/mL) every 4 weeks will be administered. Omalizumab is administered in two separate phases. In the pre-treatment period omalizumab will be administered to condition the participants to an immune tolerance state. Omalizumab will be also administered after RIT and during the maintenance immunotherapy phase. Other Names: Biological: Ragweed rush immunotherapy (RIT) RIT will consist of a series of injections containing ragweed extract. The series of injections will have progressively greater amounts of ragweed extract: starting from the 1:1000 dilution of the maintenance vial and progressing to the 0.3 mL of 1:10 dilution of the maintenance vial or the maximally tolerated amount. Biological: Ragweed immunotherapy (IT) Participants will receive weekly maintenance IT dosing for a total of 12 weeks. | Experimental: Omalizumab pre-treatment, omalizumab | Participants are pre-treated with omalizumab followed by placebo rush immunotherapy (RIT), followed by dual therapy with Omalizumab plus placebo immunotherapy (IT). | Biological: omalizumab | A minimum equivalent dose of 0.016 mg/kg/IgE (IU/mL) every 4 weeks will be administered.

Symptom scores are recorded twice daily (AM and PM). The sum of the individual symptom scores will be averaged over AM and PM to give a daily score. Each daily score will then be averaged to obtain one measure of the average daily allergy severity score for each participant. The ragweed pollen season begins when the ragweed pollen counts rise to 10 ragweed pollen grains/m3/24 hours or above on two consecutive recorded days, and the ragweed pollen season ends when the ragweed pollen counts fall below 10 ragweed pollen grains/m3/24 hours on two consecutive recorded days.
