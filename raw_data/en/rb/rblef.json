ENTITL EMENT RULING1 ABELL , Special Master : On 24 y 2007, Petitioners filed this Petition for compensa tion under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Vaccine Act or Act) alleg ing that, as a result of the2 Diphtheria -Tetanus-Acellular Pertussis (DTaP) vaccine administere d to Evely n on 11 Februar y 2004, Petitioners are reminded that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(4) and Vaccine Rule 18(b), a petitioner1 has 14 days from the date of this ruling within which to request redaction \"of any information furnished by that party (1) that is trade secret or commercial or financial information and is privileged or confidential, or (2) that are medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\" Vaccine Rule 18(b). Otherwise, \"the entire decision\" may be made available to the public per the E-Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2899, 2913 (Dec. 17, 2002). The statutory provisions governing the Vaccine Act are found in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7300aa-10 et seq. (West 19912 & Supp. 1997). Hereinafter, reference will be to the relevant subsection of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300aa.Evely n suffe red sever al seizures and eventually status epilepticus , which ushere d in a long- term3 seizure disorder . See Amended Petition. Eventually, two evidentiar y hearings on the ultimate issue of vaccine causa tion were convene d by the C ourt, the first held in vivo in Boston, Massachusetts on 6 Marc h 2008, and the second held in vitro (telephonic ally) from the Court's Chambers on 25 July 2008. Hearing Transc ripts I and II (\"Tr. I\" and \"Tr. II\"). Wherein, the Court heard from medical expert witnesses for both parties, neurolog ists both: Dr. Marc el Kinsbourne for the Petitioner, and Dr. Max Wiznitzer for the Respondent. Following those hearings, the parties filed closing briefs with the C ourt, and the ca se is now ripe f or a r uling. As a preliminary matter , the Court notes that Petitioners have satisfied the pleading requisites found in \u00a7 300aa- 11(b) and (c) of the statute, by showing that: ( 1) they are the real party at interest as legal representa tives of their daug hter Evely n, the injured party ; (2) the vaccine at issue is set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3); (3) the vaccine was administered in the United States or one of its ter ritories; (4) no one has previously collecte d an award or settlement of a civil action for damag es arising from the alleg ed vaccine-re lated injury ; and, (5) no previous civil action has been filed in this matter. Tr. I at 4. Additionally , the \u00a7 16 require ment that the Petition be timely filed have been me t. Tr. I at 5. On these matters, Respondent tende rs no dispute. Id. The Vaccine Act authorizes the Offic e of Special Masters to make ruling s and decisions on petitions for compensa tion from the Vacc ine Prog ram, to include f indings of f act and conclusions of law. \u00a712(d)( 3)(A) (I). In order to preva il on a petition f or compensa tion unde r the Vaccine Act, a petitioner must show by preponde rant evidenc e that a vaccination listed on the Vaccine Injury Table either cause d an injury specifie d on that Table within the period desig nated there in, or else that such a va ccine actually cause d an injury not so specified. \u00a7 11( c)(1)(c). I. FACTUAL RECORD Despite their accord on certain factual predic ates contained in the filed medical records, there is, unsurprisin gly, a pronounce d conflict betwee n the parties on certain factual issues of viewing understood scientific mecha nisms of vaccine injury within the context of the expert witness testimony and the medical records. Considering these disputes and the Court's commission to resolve them, it behooves the Court to explain the legal standard by which factual finding s are made. It is axiom atic to say that a petitioner bears the burden of proving , by a preponde rance of the evidenc e-which this Court has likened to fifty percent and a feather-that a particula r fact occur red or circumstance obtains. Put another way, it is require d that a specia l master, \"believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexis tence befor e [he] may find in favor of the party who has the burden to persua de the [special master] of the fact's existence .\" In re Winship, 397 Status epilepticus is \"1. a continuous series of generalized tonic-clonic seizures without return to3 consciousness, a life-threatening emergency... 2. any prolonged series of similar seizures without return to full consciousness between them.\" DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY (30th ed. 2003) (SAUNDERS) at 1756. -2-U.S. 358, 371-72 (1970) (Harlan, J ., concur ring). Moreover, mere conjecture or speculation does not meet the preponde rance standard. Snowbank Enterprises v. United States , 6 Cl. Ct. 476, 486 (1984). This Court may not rule in favor of a petitioner based on his asseve rations alone. This Court is authorized by statute to rende r finding s of fact and conclusions of law, and to grant compensa tion upon petitions that are substantiated by medical records and/or by medi cal opinion. \u00a7\u00a7 12(d)( 3)(A) (i) and 13( a)(1). Contemporane ous medical records are afforde d substantial weig ht, as has been elucidated by this Court and by the Fe deral Circuit: Medica l records, in general, warrant considera tion as trustworthy evidenc e. The records contain information supplied to or by health profe ssional s to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. With proper treatment hang ing in the balanc e, accuracy has an extra premium. These records are also generally contempora neous to the medica l events. Cucuras v. Sec of HH F. 2d 1525, 1528 ( Fed. Cir.1993). l records useful to the Court's analy sis when considere d in reference to what they include, ra ther than w hat they omit: [I]t must be recognized that the absenc e of a reference to a condition or circumstance is much less signific ant than a reference which negates the existence of the condition or circumstance. Since medical records typically record only a fraction of all that occur s, the fact that reference to an event is omitted from the medical records m ay not be ver y signific ant. Murphy v. Sec'y of HHS , 23 Cl. 726, 733 2d 1226 (Fed. C ir. 1992), cert. denied sub nom. Murphy v. Sullivan , 113 S. Ct. 263 (1992) (citations omitted), citing Clark v. Sec'y of HHS , No. 90-45V, slip op. at 3 (Cl. Ct. Spec. Mstr. Marc h 28, 1991). A. M EDICAL RECORDS ET AL. There were no issues of circumstantial fact disputed by the parties, and the medical records reveal those circumstances sufficie ntly. Tr. I at 4. The Court turns first to the recorded facts draw n from the medical records engender ed and maintained by those responding to, and treating, Evely n's condition. The Court g leane d the following from the most pertinent of the medica l records: Evely n was born 28 August 2003, and develo ped normally and relatively healthfully throug hout her first six months. Petitioners' Exhibit (\"Pet. Ex.\") 3 at 9 and 32, 4 at 4-11, 7 at 364. On 11 Februar y 2004, at her six month check-up, Evely n was administered her third DTaP vaccination. Pet. Ex. 3 at 32. At the visit, it was noted that she was healthy , albeit \"just over gastroente ritis\" for which she was seen at the emer gency room on 6 Februar y 2004. Pet. Ex. 4 at 12. Evelyn was descr ibed by her parents as cranky the evening of 11 Februar y, and awoke early the -3-morning of 12 February hot to the touch, prompti ng her parents to give her Tylenol. Pet. Ex. 7 at 360. Around 7:00 AM on the morning of 12 Februar y 2004, while Evely n had been napping after awaking earlier that morning , Mr. Sucher heard a sound coming from Evely n's room that to him \"didn't sound 'right' or natural,\" prompting him to rush in. Pet. Ex. 11 at 4 (Affidavit of Adam Sucher) . He perceived that something was wrong and intuited that Evely n was experiencing a seizure, which lasted \"roug hly five minutes\" by his estimation. Id. When Petitioners took E velyn to the hospital, she suffe red a nother seizure the re. Id. During this time, he recalls Evely n became cyanotic, and it seeme d these sy mptoms continued reg ardle ss of trea tment. Id. at 5. 4 The history of these e vents is summated in the medical re cords: [Evely n] is a 6-month-old girl who is otherwise healthy . She was just seen yesterda y by her pr imary care doctor for r outine immuniz ations. The child appar ently was a t Children's Hospital over the weekend because of vomiting and a little bit of diarrhe a. [She was orally rehydrate d and was sent home.] She was seen yesterday for her immuniz ations. She was well until this morning when she had a generalized seizure that seeme d to last less than five minutes according to her mom. Appar ently she had been very cranky throug h the night and at 7:30 [AM] they had given her some Tylenol and then about 15 minutes later the patient had the generalized seizure. ... The parents drove the child here and shortly after arriving, the patient had another seizure which laste d sever al minutes but less than five minutes but seeme d to have a prolong ed post ictal period. The child has no past history of seizures. She has not been febrile over the last few days as far as the parents know. She was not febrile over the weekend whe n she had he r vomiting a nd diarrhe a. Pet. Ex . 3 at 20. On phy sical examination, it was noted: [The seizure was] a generalized seizure, tonic-clonic, lasting sever al minutes althoug h less than five minutes. The patient was then post ictal and seeme d to have a prolong ed post ictal per iod. Her te mp on arriva l here was only 100.8 rec tally... After the patient had her generalized seizure on arrival here, she was then not ed to have sever al staring episodes and some twitching of the face at which time she was given 0.05 mg /kg of Ativan. Id. In giving a n impression, the trea ting Eme rgency Depa rtment phy sician pre sciently noted: At this time, I feel that the patient should be transfe rred to a tertiary care cente r as this does not fit int o the categ ory of a simple febrile seizure. I n fac t, the child may have a seizure disorder and this will need further evalua tion. She will need neurolog y consult. Id. at 21. Her final diag nosis there wa s \"status epilepticus .\" Id. Cyanosis is \"a bluish discoloration, especially of the skin and mucous membranes due to excessive4 concentration of deoxyhemoglobin in the blood.\" DORLAND'S, supra at 3, at gency room, Evely n was transfe rred to New England Medica l Center, wher e the admission noted that Evely n had been \"irritable\" the previous evening , which her parents ascribed to the vaccination, and had vomited once. Pet. Ex. 10 at 9. There she was diagnosed with \"complex seizures.\" Id. at 14. Ther e was initi ally some suspicion conce rning an infectious cause for the seizures, given Evely n's prior prese nce in day care, but given the absenc e of supporting physical finding s, this was of diminis hed conce rn. Id. at 11. The treating physicians also considere d her family history and her recent history of vaccination in relation to the possibili ty of febrile seizure, noting that even though her tempera ture when first measure d was at 100.8 F, that reading \"may be confounde d by [the] recent tylenol dose,\" or may have been eleva ted due to the physical stress of the seizure. Id. Neur ologists at Ne w Eng land Medica l Center assessed the seizures as \"unpr ovoked\" a side from the slightly eleva ted tempera ture and Evely n's family history , which neurolog ist Dr. Baron said he would \"conside r.\" Pet. Ex. 10 at 13 (empha sis in original). The treating physicians repeatedly5 noted in descr ibing Evely n's condition her recent history of DTaP vaccination, but none of them seeme d to attribute a causa l connec tion in doing so. Pet. Ex. 10 at 25, 77; Pet. Ex. 4 at 13. She was eventually released from the hos pital after another week t here. Pet. Ex. 10 at 175. Her dischar ge summary stated that on the day of her vaccinations she was in \"good health\" althoug h she had experience d \"a brief viral illness consisting of some low grade tempera tures, a few episodes of emesis, and diarrhe a\" about one week prior there to. Pet. Ex. 10 at 174. It also recounted that Evely n was irr itable and suff ered one bout of e mesis in the evening following the vac cine a dminist ration, which sy inations. Id. Unfortuna tely, Evely n's seizure activity continued in the months that followed. She was again admitted to the hospital on 28 April 2004 due to \"persistent seizure breakthroug h\" and rema ined there until 13 May 2004. Pet. Ex. 10 at 201, 616. During that stay, Evely n was examined by pediatric neurolog ist Dr. J ames Riviello, who rec orded: She was in her usual state of health until Februar y, when she had the onset of her seizures. She had her six month check up, she was fine, had her immuniz ations, and after that, she seeme d fussy that day and [her parents] wonder ed if she was \"sensitive to the shots.\" When she awakened the next day, she was still irritable, did not want to play, she went back to sleep, her fathe r then heard her have a scream, and when he went into the room, she was having a seizure. Her body was stiff, her eyes were deviated to one side, but they are not sure what side it was and it lasted under two minutes in duration. She had not been eating well that morning . They went to the Emerg ency Depa rtment Newton- d letharg ic there , woke up screaming , then had another seizure, she was not febrile at the time, a CT scan and a lumbar puncture were done, these were unrema rkable , she was given lorazepam a nd then to the B oston Floating Hospital.... Evelyn's mother suffered from one or more isolated and benign febrile seizure(s) as a child. Pet. Ex. 10 at5 174. -5-Other than some rare staring spells, without any associate d motor stigmata of seizures, she was well until sever al weeks ago, when again, she woke up screaming , was having a seizure, t hey thought that this one seemed mor e severe, it was longer and the motor movements were more drama tic, this lasted three minutes, she went onto [sic] then have recurrent seizures, that subseq uently lasted from five to seven minutes in duration, and was a lso cy anotic. ... [Evely n] has no known allerg ies, her immuniz ations are up to date, and she has been relatively healthy from an infec tious disease point of view, althoug h has a stomach- flu-like illness on two occasions, one of these occur red just befor e her recent hospitaliz ation by about one we ek. ... The family history is positive for a febrile seizure in her mother, following an immuniz ation, and the mate rnal g randmother had an unc le with seizures. ... Evely n's examination is essentially unrema rkable . ... She currently has been seizure free after her se cond episode of a flurry of seizures. Her seizures clinically sound generalized, althoug h appar ently there was some focality on her EE Gs, I believe w ith bicentral spikes. ... We also discussed the possibili ty that this could be a familial tendenc y to her seizures, since her mother did have a febrile seizure. In addition, the onset was within 24 hours of immuniz ation, but currently , the acellular pertussis is not thought to cause the same neurolog ical conseque nces that could be seen with the whole-c ell pertus sis, but even this was rare. I also emphasized the importance of making a specific diag nosis, since this allows us to better answe r their que stions. Pet. Ex . 32 at 1-3. At a follow-up visit with Dr. Riviello in September 2005, following an admission to the hospital for a generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting 25 minutes that would not stop, notwithstanding medication, at which time her tempera ture was 104EF. Pet. Ex. 7 at 344. She had suffe red another seizure the morning of her visit with Dr. Riviello as well, and he direc ted signific ant conce rn (and most of his notes' discussion) to her blend of medications and her dosag e levels. Id. at 344-45. He also brief ly considere d what mig ht be the ae tiology of Evely n's seizures: In revie w of the family history , her mother had febrile seizures, and there was a materna l great uncle, with a generalized tonic clonic seizure. I spent a good deal of time talking to them today about the aetiolog y of the seizures, and treatment, and wonder ed whether she has the entity of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures -6-plus, which can be associate d with multipl e seizure types in the same family . So far, gene testing is available for only one subt ype of this, and thi s is a sodi um channe l6 gene, a nd I shall order this. Pet. Ex . 7 at 345. Evely n's seizures continued, despite nuance d re-combinations of medications. See, e.g., Pet. Ex. 6 at 1-3 and 18-20; Pet. E x. 7 at 54-55 and 65-67. Howeve r, the Court conclude s its revie w of the medical records inasmuch as (a) it is appar ent that Evely n's condition of intracta ble seizu res exceede d the six months require d by statute, and (b) the Court's purpose here is to deter mine what initially cause d the seizure disorder to express itself. B. T ESTIMONY BEARING ON ENTITLEMENT The Court greatly appre ciated hearing from two eminent scholars on the question prese nted in this case. At the c onclusion of the first he aring , the Court noted: I have great for both experts, Docto rs Kinsbourne and Wiznitzer. I have heard both of you gentlemen frequently over the years. And I once again will thank y ou acc ording ly. Tr. I at 115-116. Both experts' testimony is accepted as admissible in toto, and the Court reiter ates its gra ing the ir cre dible, profe ssional expertise. The doctor is here referring to SCN1A. Results from testing for a mutation of the SCN1A gene in Evelyn 6 were negative. -7-1. Marc el Kinsbourne, MD At the primary entitlement hearing, Dr. Kinsbourne pinpointed the DTaP vaccination, and7 specific ally the acellular pertussis component there in, which Evely n received the day before her first8 seizure, as the cause of her long- term seizure disorder . Tr. I at 8. He explained his theory , representing to the Court that it was a medically and scientifi cally reasonable explanation for Evely n's injury to have be en ca used by the per tussis t oxin within the DTaP vacc ine: very well-known potentially [neuro-tox ic] agent, because of pertussis toxin contained in the vaccine. Although pertussis toxin is a newe r toxin, it cannot be remove d from the vaccine because it is the chief agent against which the immunit y is develope d. For which purpose , the vac cine is g iven in the first plac e. Regarding the difference between acellular pertussis vaccine and its predecessor, the Court notes:7 Technologic developments have allowed identification and selective extraction of the individual [Bordetella] pertussis antigenic constituents that induce the immunologic response in the host necessary to prevent infection. The antigens that are important in provoking a host immune response and are components of acellular pertussis vaccines are inactivated pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, fimbriae, and pertactin. Pertussis toxin promotes attachment of the bacterium to ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, provokes lymphocytosis, and sensitizes cells to histamine effects. Development of a host antibody response against pertussis toxin may be crucial to development of protective immunity... All four of the currently approved DTaP vaccines contain pertussis toxin that has been detoxified by chemical inactivation or attenuated by molecular genetic techniques to reduce (compared with whole-cell DTP vaccine) the amount of bacterial endotoxin per dose. Pet. Ex. 21, Dennis A. Conrad and Hal B. Jensen, Using acellular pertussis vaccines for childhood immunization, 105 (7) POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE ONLINE, 1-12 (1999). The Court recites a brief introduction of the pertussis toxin from one article of medical literature filed in this8 matter: The secreted pertussis toxin (PT) is a decisive virulence factor of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of the childhood disease whooping cough. PT is organized according to the AB structural principle which is typical for numerous bacterial toxins. The A-protomer consists of a single polypeptide (S1) ADP-ribosylation of the a-subunit of several heterotrimeric inhibitory iG proteins. This modification blocks the inhibitory effect of G proteins on adenylate cyclase and in this way not only interferes with the homeostatic inhibitory regulation of adenylate cyclase stimulation but also results in a modulation of G-protein-mediated signal transduction, a central step in cellular communication. ... The B-oligomer mediates binding and uptake of PT by target cells and the translocation of the S1 subunit. Pet. Ex. 19 (Kerstin E. Br\u00fcckener et al., Permeabilization in a cerebral endothelial barrier model by pertussis toxin involves the PKC effector pathway and is abolished by elevated levels of cAMP, 116 (9) JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE, 1837-1846 (2003)) at 1837 (citations omitted). Dr. Kinsbourne cited this article because it discusses the role of the B oligomer (\"branch\") in raising the permeability, and therefore penetrability, of and through certain cells of the human blood-brain barrier. The Court notes some similarity between this theory and the one rejected by a now-departed special master in Moberly v. Sec'y of HHS, No 98-0910V, 2005 WL 1793416, (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Jun. 30, 2005), which rejection was upheld by Judge Wolski of the Court of Federal Claims (85 Fed. Cl. 571 (2009)), and a panel of the Federal Circuit (__ F. 3d __, 2010 WL 118661 (Fed. Cir. 2010)), and which is the subject of a motion for en banc review of the Federal Circuit. -8-Now, pertussis toxin has a mecha nism of injury of neurons, which has been well established and has been known about and outlined for many years. It attache s to such structure s in the cell walls of certain 13 neurons called G proteins. And the neurons that -- it attache s to neurons that are largely inhibit ory in nature . The pertussis toxin attached to those G proteins inactivates these inhibitory neurons, thereby disturbing the balanc e of excitation versus inhibiti on in the brain. And there by, facilitating or causing seizures . And in my repor t, I give some more chemica l details of this cascade of events. And as counsel said, I submitt ed some literature with respec t to that. Tr. I at 12-13. Dr. Kinsbourne replied to Dr. Wiznitzer's criticism that any such injury from the DTaP vac cine is spec ulative by referring to medic al literature supporting Petitioner' s contention: There are two ways of addre ssing that. One is, as a preliminary matter, to point out that, of the articles I revie wed, and on the adverse effe cts of the acellular vaccine,9 not a single one of them says, well, they couldn't have happene d. This ha d to ha ve been coincidenta l because the pertussis toxin is -- toxoided, is inactivated. And, no such claim is made. In fact, none of the article s take the position for any reason that the ac ellular va ccine is safe. I n fac t, they warn against making that assumption. But, more specific ally, I have researched the matter. And I am able to provide to the Court, if the Court so wishes, literature to the effect that the toxoiding proce ss in pertussis vaccine manufa cture is imperfe ct, and that, in many cases, substantial pertussis tox in does rema in. Tr. I. at 13-14, re Pet. Ex . 39-40.10 Dr. Kinsbourne next addre ssed whether the timing of onset following the vaccination fit within the medically -appr opriate time fr ame: [T]he usual time frame, which I adopted, which is generally adopted, is three days. But, case repor ts show that the great majority of these acute events happen in the first day. And even maybe in the first 12 hours or so. So that, it is very typical of sever e reactions to pertussis vacc ine to occur very early on as they did in this case . One example pointed out by Petitioners in their brief states, in part:9 The adverse events profile of DTaP vaccines is more favorable than that of whole-cell DTP vaccines, in terms of both mild local and systemic reactions and moderate to severe reactions. However, the number of subjects who have received DTaP vaccines to date has been too small to calculate the risk of extremely rare but potentially life-threatening reactions (e.g., immediate anaphylaxis, encephalopathy). Moreover, the moderately severe adverse reactions (e.g., temperature exceeding 104EF (40EC), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, persistent crying, seizures) reported with use of whole-cell DTP vaccine have also been observed with use of DTaP vaccine. Pet. Ex. 21, Dennis A. Conrad and Hal B. Jensen, Using acellular pertussis vaccines for childhood immunization, 105 (7) POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE ONLINE, 1-12 (1999) (emphasis added). The Court's review of the medical literature filed in this case is included infra at page 30 et seq.10 -9-Tr. I at 18. Dr. Kinsbourne also noted the absenc e of any other triggering cause for Evely n's 12 Februar y 2004 seizures, but c oncede d that she very likely was genetica lly susceptible or otherwise vulnera ble to a seizure disorde r: I have no doubt that there is some vulnera bility factor, or susceptibility factor in this child. After all, milli ons get this vaccine and do not react in this way. So, there has to be some -- something is going on. And maybe, there is some genetic susceptibility factor at play . We don't know at this time what that is. But, without reser vation, I am not awa re of any other a lternative pote ntial causa tion. Id. Dr. Kinsbourne was unawa re of any place in the medical records wher e treating doctors identified an alterna tive cause . Id. at 19. Later, Dr. Kinsbourne was asked what signific ance lay in the gastrointestinal symptoms that preceded Evely n's six-month examination and vaccination, and he noted that no full-blown fever accompanied them, and that they had resolved by the time of her visit t o the doctor. Tr . I at 39. One point that both experts agreed was in the classifica tion of Evely n's first seizure. When the Court asked if the seizure could be typed a \"febrile seizure,\" Dr. Kins bourne clarified that Evely n's first seizure(s) on the morning of 12 Februar y 2004 \"would be categorized as a seizure with fever.\" Tr . I at 20. He e xplained the distinction: [T]here is a semantic issue here which is alway s good to be very clear about. There is an entity called be nign f ebrile se izures, which ar e seizures that a re de fined by an accompany ing tempera ture, but also by the fact that they are short lasting, usually two or three minutes, certainly not more than 15. They do not recur sequentially as in this case. And they have a very, very good prognosis. Now, it is very clear that Evely n's seizure was not in that category. And in fact, that is specific ally stated in the record. So, I would say it is a -- what one sometimes c alls a complex fe brile seizure, which is a type that is known to be associate d with brain damag e in some children. It is not a benig n febr ile seizure. Tr. I at 20. Howeve r, Dr. Kinsbourne did believe that Evely n suffe \"a complex descr \"status epilepticus ,\" which he define d as \"one or more seizures adding up to a total of half an hour.\" Tr. I at 28-29. Dr. Kinsbourne noted later that he did not derive the diagnosis of status epilepticus , but that such diagnosis was rende red by the treating doc tors. Tr. I at 31; see Pet. E x. 3 at 21. He explained that the standa rd of ha lf an hour is just a ref erence point, \"a definition of conve nience .\" Tr. I at 31. Dr. K insbourne continued: [W]hat you are really saying is, this is a serious continuing seizure event which needs manag ement, needs to be stopped, or otherwise, the child is going to be in ve ry bad trouble. And that may prese nt as one seiz ure, that just goe s on and on and on until you hopefully stop it. Or, the seizures kee p coming . Whatever state in the brain is still generating them is still there . It's going on. And they come again and again and again. And these two patterns are really treated in the same way. They both are serious, ominous, and have to be stopped.... So, I don't think that adding it up is the only way to look at it, althoug h it is a legitimate way to look at it. There is something going on in this child's brain after the vaccination which wasn't going on befor e. -10-There was some kind of tendenc y to abnorma l neurona l discharg e which wasn't befor e. And it was g oing on a nd on. I t neede d to be stopped. Tr. I at 31-32. Dr. Kinsbou rne explained and distinguished into three categories the medical literature Petitioner filed in support of Dr. Kinsbourne' s expert opinion: 1. Articles addre ssing the effects of the DPT (whole- cell) vaccine; 2. Articles explaining that when adver se events followed from the DTaP vaccine, they were of simil ar if not identical nature as those events following the DTP vaccine, even if events following DTaP were much more infrequent; and 3. Small-power epidemiolog ic studies of DTaP adve rse events. Tr. I at 8-11. On cross-e xamination, Dr. Kinsbourne acceded that Evely n did not suffe r a \"Table Injury .\" Tr. I at 23. He also conce ded that none of the treaters implicated the DTaP vaccine as a cause of the seizures, but added that the treaters did not much pursue aetiology to conclusion, but primarily considere d genetic testing for a genetic source for the seizures. Tr. I at 24-25. Dr. Kinsbourne elabor ated on the genetic testing of the SCN1A gene, the results of which demonstrated that Evely n did not have a mutation of tha t particular gene w hich would pre dispose her to a seizure disorder : It tests for over 100 varia nts of one particula r gene. The reason it is chosen, of course, is that there are many serious epilepsies of early onset in which that test is positive. I t just happened not to be he re. Tr. I at 25. This led to a we ighty conce ssion by Dr. Kinsbourne amid cross-e xamination: Q And the fact that that test wasn't positive here doesn't mean that this child doesn't have a genetic disorde r? A No. On the c ontrary , I think she might we ll have one. Q What do you mean by that, when you say she might well have a genetic disorder? A I mean the same that I was saying as a proviso earlier, that when an individual child has such a seve re reaction to an ag ent, which e licits in almost everybody else no reaction at all, there has to be a host factor as well as the environmental factor. And even in SCN1A, the mere fact of having that varia nt is a necessary, but not a sufficie nt explanation of why an individual might have a very sever e epilepsy . There is a collision betwe en the gene, which rende rs a person susceptible, and the enviro nment, which has an age nt which the person has been rende red susceptible. So, I assume that there is something specia l about Evely n's constitution, if you like, that made her react in this way to a medication, if you like, which all seven of my children ha d no trouble with at all. Q And so, how do you know that there is a conflue nce betwee n the environmenta l factor and the genetic factor? Could you develop epilepsy just on the genetic f actor ? A Well, we don't know actua lly. We are discussing the possibili ties. We don't know whether she had a genetic factor. It's conce ivable that there are genetic -11-varia tions which compel a severe seizure outcome under any circumstances. I just don't know of a ny wher e we can r eally say that.... Q But, genetics can be a cause of epilepsy . And is it fair to assume that the physicians who were running these genetic tests thought that Evely n might suffer from a g enetic a bnormality as the c ause of her se izure? A Without purporting to know t heir state of mind, I would say that they more likely thought -- wanted to know why this child was vulnera ble to an agent while others ar e not. Tr. I at 25-27. Returning to Dr. Kinsbourne' s descr iption of seizure with fever, Resp ondent asked what cause d the fever, and Dr. Kinsbourne noted that \"the pertussis vaccines is known sometimes to cause ... fever.\" Tr. I at 33. This pr ompted the Court to ask which came first, the fever or the seizure, to which Dr. Kinsbourne replied that the fever appea red first, \"[b]ased on the parents' observa tion of the child in the morning ... that she was warm, which occasioned them to give Tylenol.\" Id., referencing Pet. Ex. 7 at 360. Regarding the tempera ture taken after the second seizure, at the hospital, Dr. Kinsbourne agreed that the seizure proce ss itself can eleva te body tempera ture, \"[i]f they are prolonged, because of the metabolic demands of the continuing firing . I think, it's less likely to be the case when they are brief. A nd they stayed re latively brief.\" Tr. I at 38. L ikewise, he ag reed that a temper ature of 100.8 E F would be considere d \"a low- grade feve r.\" Id. Dr. Kinsbourne was called briefly for rebuttal testimony , where he concede d one of Dr. Wiznitzer's centra l contentions, while still affirming his opinion of vaccine causa tion: Evely n had a susceptibility or vulnera bility to ha ving seizure disorder. ... And there are many differ ent reasons. There are some reasons we know. Some reasons hypothetical. Some reasons might have been uncover ed had she had those [additi onal genetic] tests. None of that makes any differ ence to my belief that she was, indee d, susceptible. When I say that the pertussis vaccines ca used the seizure disorder, I didn't say it was like a blow on the head in an otherwise perfectly normal person. Of course , it cause d it in that person, because that person was vulnera ble to having it cause d in that person. So, I see no contra diction between giving a causa tional opinion for pertussis vaccine and acknowledg ing a susceptibility or vulnera bility which could be very real. Tr. I at 112. At the seconda ry hearing, seiz ure disorder was cause d by the acellular pertussis vaccine, and that the premise that acellular pertussis can cause such an injury is considere d plausible within many in the medical community , and that such conse nsus is repre sented by vacc ine's inclusion on the Va ccine Injury Table: It's very generally believed. T here have be en a numbe r of epidemiologica l studies that have compared the two types of pertussis vaccines with respe ct to adver se effects, including neurologic al adverse effe cts, and all of them have found t hat the -12-spectrum of effects is much the same. Although of course the incidence of those effects is far less when the acellular vac cine is used, nonetheless, t hose effec ts still occur . And none of the article s have questioned that the acellular vaccine is fundame ntally capa ble of c ausing neurolog ical har , the vaccine injury table has expli citly bracketed together the DTP vaccine and the DTaP vaccine as cause s of the table injury encephalopathy , which of course implies that the acellular pertussis vaccine is inde ed capable of damag ing the brain. And with respe ct to the prese nt case, if it's able to cause encephalopathy , it is clearly able to ca use the lesse r leve l of injury involved in a seve re seizure. Tr. II at 6-7. He reiter ated this point later, emphasizi ng that \"if the Court were to find that the acellular vaccine is incapa ble of causing neurolog ical harm, that would be in direc t conflict with the wording of the va ccine injury table.\" T r. II at 16. He elabora ted, as we ll, the mechanism for this inj ury at the antig en leve l: [P]ertussis toxin is generally believed to be the major agent of adver se effects when they occur , when they infreque ntly occur , after pertussis vaccination. This toxin has two branc hes or wing s, the A and the B . The A se ction is thought to be the section which inflicts damag e on neurons when such damag e occur s by a proce ss called ADP ribosy lation, which in fact impairs inhibiti on and cause s neurons to fire excessively and som etimes fuels seiz ures or even c ell death. I will refer to that as ADPR as of now. Now the B component of the toxin has among its functions the attachme nt of the toxin to the cell. So clearly if the toxin can't attach to the cell becaus e the B component isn't working, then the A component could not inflict damag e. Now, because of the know n fac t that the whole-c ell pertussis vaccine does at times c ause sever e neurolog ical damag e, the acellular vaccine, which too contains much the same amount of pertuss is toxin because that's really the main source of the immunit y which is aimed for by the vaccination, is toxoided. That is an attempt to rende r it inactive, to rende r the A branc h of the toxin ina ctive such as it can no longe r inflict harm. And it seems that this toxoiding has had a considera ble effect because, indeed, the incidenc e of ha rm is much less than it was in the whole- cell vac cine. Howeve r, the two article s [Pet. Ex. 39 and 40] show that the efficacy of inactivating the A bra nch of the pertussis tox in is not i nvaria bly 100 percent but rathe r that in a simil ar vaccine, it is not infreque ntly the case that ADPR typically can still be identified to a signific ant extent. So we cannot reliably say that because the vaccine is toxoided, it couldn't inflict neurolog ical harm. That would depend on whether the particular lot of the particula r vaccine was in fact 100 percent protec ted against ADPR activity . And the literature shows both in the two article s that I've cited and in many others that there is no assura nce of that. I might add that there are numerous methods of toxoiding, and there are a varie ty of formulations of acellular vaccines. And the problem with reliably getting rid of ADPR activity is one that is still ongoing, and t here is still an energ etic research effort ongoing to try to produce an improved late-g eneration acellular vaccine which will guarantee that toxicity is completely and per manently abolished. -13-... ADP ribosy lation could have been still prese nt in the vaccine lot that Evely n Sucher received. Of course , we don't know whether it was, and we don't know the relative efficacy of toxoid in that particula r vaccine. That's a level of detail which I don't believe the Court necessarily would like to addre ss. In response to this point, Dr. Wiznitzer pointed out in fact even if the A wing of the pertussis toxin were still active, that wouldn't matter if the B wing were inactivated. And he argued that the toxoiding might have inactivated the B w ing e ven if it didn't completely inactivate the A portion. And that's cogent because if the B wing is inactivated, then the toxin can no longe r attach to the cells, and there fore, the toxin could not inflict harm. Howeve r, althoug h Dr. Wiznitzer filed numerous article s, I didn't perceive in any of them any evidenc e that tox oiding of a similar vaccine indeed does inactivate the B wing of the toxi n, and ther efore, I have to r etain my previous opinion. Tr. II at 8-9, 11. Dr. Kinsbourne continued this explanation by discussing an article of medical literature filed by Respondent, noting that the article discussed the possibili ty, as a research goal, not current practice, of making a vaccine with only the \"B\" aspec t of the toxin, which would avoid the imperfe ctions of the current manufa cturing methods. Tr. II at 12-13, discussing Resp. Ex. H at 1132. This prompted a que stion from the Court: THE COURT: Dr. Kinsbourne, would inactivation of the B wing of the toxin affect the antibody response /interac tion? THE WITNESS: There is some evidenc e from submitt ed article s that the B portion itself can generate signific ant immunit y. Whether it will be as effective as using the whole toxi n is an open que stion. Tr. II at 13-14. Dr. Kinsbourne also explained a problem that may arise under the current toxoiding proce sses, eve n when the pr ocess is complete ly effective, the problem of \" reversion\": There is a second problem which also hasn't been fully dealt with as yet, which is even if the toxoid has completely utiliz ed ADPR activity , it's been found that on occasion that molecule ca n revert to the active toxin state. In other words, it again has the same adver se effec ts that it would have had had it not been tox oided i n the first place . Tr. II at 14. Petitioners prompted Dr. Kinsbourne to point out a portion of literature filed by Respondent which a cknowledg es this conce rn: \"Thus, the major advanta ge of using the B oligomer as a compon ent in a vaccine would be the inability of this protein to revert to the enzymatically active form of the toxin which has previously been repor ted with chemica lly modified toxins.\" In other words, because the A part has been repor ted to revert and become toxic again, it would be an advanta ge if one could use the B part for the vaccine. But this again is projec ted into the future. -14-Pet. Ex. II at 15, quoting Resp. Ex. H at 1135. Dr. Kinsbourne' s direc t examination broug ht to light that, as compar ed to this article filed by Respondent, the article s filed supplementally by Petitioners (Pet. Ex. 39 and 40) performed their testing \"on actua l [toxoided] vaccines manufa cture d for administration in the United States,\" and that they were more current, having been published as late as 2007. Tr. I I at 15-16. 2. Max W iznitzer, MD At the primary hear ing, D r. Wiz nitzer clarified the categories of seizures and their re lative sever ity: It is rare that we, as child neurolog ists, will see a child with a simple febrile seizure. Even if they are admitted to the hosp ital. [Neur ologists] get involved if there is recurrent febrile seizure, in other words, if it's happene d more than once, or if it's a complex febrile seizure. By definition of febrile seiz ure, period, a febrile se izure is a seizure i n a child with a rectal tempera ture at or greater than 102 degrees, which is 39 degrees Centigr ade. Simpl e febrile seizur e is basica lly a generalized convulsion, either stiffening or shaking , but, a seizure[] with no focal features, that probably -- it probably lasts less than about 15 minutes or so. Technically speaking , it should be less than 30 minutes. But, on the a verage, it's ra re tha t they go bey ond 50 minutes. A complex partial seizure is basica lly the same tempera ture criter ia for a tempera ture that is associate d with a febrile seizure, but you have other phenomenon that are associate d with it. Either, there is recurrent seizures during the day, more than one, or it's a seiz ure that lasts for more than 30 minutes. It's a seiz ure th at occurs with focal features, which means one side shakes, or you may have head turning to one side with no shaking , or no clonic a ctivity ... of any type. Tr. I at 47-48. He ag reed with Dr. Kinsbourne that Evely n's ca se represe nts \"not a f ebrile se izure.\" Tr. I at 71. Acc ording to at least one study 's criter ia, the standard to be counted a febrile seizure is 102EF, which means that, with Evely n's measure d tempera ture of 100.8 EF, her seizure should be accou nted afebrile. Tr. I at 71-72, referencing Pet. Ex. 26. He also agreed with Dr. Kinsbourne that the initial seizures which occur red the day after vaccination were indivisi bly related to the seizure disorder that followed, that they are all of a pie ce. T r. I at 108. Dr. Wiznitzer's biggest disag reement with Dr. Kinsbourne regards the medical plausibilit y of direc t injury by pertussis toxin in the acellular pertussis (DTa P) vaccine via disruption of G proteins leading to incre ased neurona l excitabilit y, which Dr. Wiznitzer disputed on three separ ate grounds: first, he disput es the causal relationship betwee n pertussis toxin and onset of epilepsy ; second, he pointed to emer gent understanding that epileptic encephalopathies \"proba bly are not related in a causa l manner to the pertussis toxin, but are related to an underly ing genetic predisposition to seizures that is going to show itself\" inevitably ; and third, that the treating doctors considere d the DTaP vaccine as a cause , but decide d to pursue genetic susceptibility instead. Tr. I at 50-56. The first two objections challeng e Petitioner's proof \"can it\" prong of causa tion -15-(whe ther the vaccine can cause the injury latter conce rns the \"did it\" prong (whe ther the vaccine cause d the injury in the instant case) . Discussing the relative capability of the DTaP vaccine to affect the brain sufficie ntly to result in a seizure, Dr. Wiznitzer pointed out the Lovejoy (or Loveday ) decision in Britain, which order ed the subjects of an epidemiolog ical study to be contac ted and their records examined, as a rebuttal to the DTP and NCES studies which had established the association betwee n pertussis toxin and11 \"acute neurolog ic events.\" Tr. I at 50-51. According to Dr. Wiznitzer, there the court's order ed study resulted in a finding \"that a few of [the subjects t hen] had no persisting problems,\" and \"an alterna te causa tion f or all the others\" could be identifie d. Tr. I at 51. Dr. Wizni tzer alluded also12 (without citation) to a more recent analy sis that did not support a causa l relationship, which excluded sever al data points, data points which had bee n included by the I OM in its analy sis. Id. See Pet. Ex. 16 (R. Alderslade et al., Whooping Cough, THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD ENCEPHALOPATHY11 STUDY, 80-83, 101-106, 148-150 (1981)), which concluded there was a statistically significant higher risk for neurologic injury associated with the recent receipt of the DPT vaccine. There was a dispute between the experts that is (at best) tangential to the matter at hand: whether Evelyn's course would have qualified her to participate as a subject in that study if it had been conducted contemporaneously with her condition. Dr. Kinsbourne argued that she would be included because she fit the injuries studied and the onset window following vaccination; Dr. Wiznitzer pointed out that the NCES study studied only vaccinees of the whole-cell pertussis vaccine. Neither expert explained why such dispute was remotely relevant to what caused Evelyn's seizures. However, the IOM did not rest on one set of data points either, but followed a diachronic approach12 themselves, as Dr. Kinsbourne mentioned in his expert report: Based on a 10-year follow-up of the NCES cohort, the Institute of Medicine further concluded \"that the balance of the evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between DPT and the forms of chronic nervous system dysfunction described in the NCES in those children who experience a serious acute neurological illness within 7 days after receiving DPT.\" Pet. Ex. 14, citing to Pet. Ex. 31 (Kathleen R. Stratton et al., Editors, Institute of Medicine: DPT VACCINE AND CHRONIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION: A NEW ANALYSIS, 15 (1994)), referencing Pet. Ex. 28 (Nicola Madge et al., The National Childhood Encephalopathy Study: A 10-Year Follow-Up, 35 (68) DEVELOPMENTAL MEDICINE AND CHILD NEUROLOGY, 1-118 (1993)). -16-In support, Dr. Wiznitzer discussed the finding s of a study performed on mice which13 compar ed the inter leukin-depe ndent neur ologic DTP and DTaP vaccines: going to induce pro-infla mmatory cytokine production of the brain and associated neurologic chang es,\" wher eas \"acellular pertussis are devoid of active toxins and there fore do not induce inflammatory cytokines or neurolog ic reactions.\" Tr. I at 64, citing Pet. Ex. 17 at 30. He added that, based on this animal m odel, \"in the in vivo phenomenon, there is no impact when you've detoxi fied the toxin. It seems to get rid of the effect.\" Tr. I at 64. Dr. That study compared inflammatory cytokine responses between the DTP and the DTaP vaccines:13 The cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a pivotal role in mediating central responses to stress, infection and disease and we have previously shown that infection of mice with B. pertussis or parenteral administration with [whole-cell pertussis] leads to an increase in IL-1\u00e2 centrally. We have already demonstrated that an increase in core body temperature following parenteral administration of [whole-cell pertussis] was associated with increased IL-1\u00e2 in the hypothalamus. This IL-1\u00e2-mediated increase in temperature was identified as a causative factor in the development of convulsive behaviour in [whole-cell pertussis]-immunized mice. The central effects of IL-1\u00e2 in response to [whole-cell pertussis] immunization, may be dependent on the ratio of this pro-inflammatory cytokine to factors that inhibit its bioactivity.... [I]mmunization with [whole-cell pertussis], but not [acellular pertussis], resulted in an increase in the ratio of IL-1RI to IL-1RII mRNA expression in the murine hypothalamus.... Immunization [whole-cell associated IL-1\u00e2, whereas [acellular pertussis] increases IL-1ra in the hypothalamus.... The increased incidence of adverse neurological events following immunization with [whole-cell pertussis] compared with [acellular pertussis] is largely unexplained. It has been suggested that residual toxins, including LPS and PT, present in [whole-cell pertussis] preparations may be responsible for the neurological reactions. We have previously demonstrated a role for the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1\u00e2, in mediating central events following pertussis infection or immunization with [whole-cell pertussis]. Using a murine seizure model, we demonstrated that [whole-cell pertussis]-induced convulsive behaviour was associated with an increase in IL-1\u00e2 in the hippocampus.... Furthermore, we have demonstrated that active bacterial toxins, including LPS and PT, at the dose present in [whole-cell pertussis] preparations, could induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the brain and associated neurological changes observed following immunization with [whole-cell pertussis]. In contrast, [acellular pertussis] are devoid of active toxins and therefore do not induce inflammatory cytokines or neurological reactions, but one of its components, filamentous haemagglutinin, can induce anti-inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages and dendritic cells.... Our findings demonstrate differential effects on IL-1-associated signalling components following [whole-cell pertussis] and [acellular the murine hypothalamus. Immunization with [whole-cell pertussis] resulted in a concomitant increase in IL-1RI mRNA and a decrease in hypothalamus. [Whole-cell pertussis]-induced IL-1\u00e2 protein in the hypothalamus by an increase in caspase-1 and IL-1\u00e2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, [whole-cell pertussis] immunization resulted in increased activity of the stress-activated kinase. In contrast, immunization with [acellular pertussis] failed to activate pro-inflammatory IL-1 responses but resulted in an increased production of IL-1ra. These results provide evidence that suggests that the increased incidence of neurological side-effects associated with [whole-cell pertussis], but not [acellular pertussis], are due to a concomitant increase in IL-1\u00e2 and IL-1 components centrally which facilitate its reactogenicity. Pet. Ex. 17 (Michelle E. Armstrong et al., \"IL-1\u00e2-dependent neurological effects of the whole cell pertussis vaccine: a role for IL-1-associated signalling components in vaccine reactogenicity, 136 J. NEUROIMMUNOLOGY, 25-33 (2003)) (citations omitted). -17-Wiznitzer believed that the pertussis component within the acellular pertussis vaccine follows a differ ent \"mode of action\" than does the whole-c ell vaccine, and pointed to that article in support. Tr. I at 64-65. He believed any compar ison betwee n whole-c ell and acellular pertussis that in the acellular varie ty, \"pertussis tox in [] cle arly has been reduc ed in its potenc y, if not -- if not had an evolution in its potency .\" Tr. I at 66. Indeed, he continued in this vein to state that the differ ence betwee n the two is not quant itative but qualitative: \"the core component, which is pertussis toxin, is it not the same thing in the DTAP as it is in whole cell pertussis.\" Tr. I at 67. He added that even wher e studies purported to descr ibe a simil n adver events of DTP and DTaP, such studies ne glected to me ntion that the long- term sequela e of those reactions were more benig n, adding that among revisit ed subjects of purported DTaP vaccine injuries, \"none of the children ever developed epilepsy .\" Tr. I at 67-68, citing Pet. Ex. 18. Apply ing that to the instant case, Dr. Wiznitzer said \"you don't see basica lly the progression here that Dr. Kinsbourne is positing.\" Tr . I at 68. Dr. Wiznitzer did not believe the medical literature filed by Petitioner on the adver se events associate d with DTP were persua sive in this case, because of the differ ence betwee n DTP and DTaP vaccines, and because he accounts the trend in emer ging research to be discounting the previously - understood link betwee n the DTP vac lite. I mean, DTAP is a very refined vaccine that has an extremely limit ed number of antig ens that are prese nt in there , depending on which vaccine you get, if I'm not mistaken, there's either three or four. And it does not have that whole slew -- that whole soup and slush that you find in the whole cell vaccine wher e there is a lot of other factors in there that you don't wish to be added. Only because they are more likely to provoke some sort of an adver se event. And since -- if you -- you can't compare the two, that basica lly breaks the chain of a logic al associa tion. Tr. I at 70. Another point Dr. Wiznitzer made on the infea sibili ty of vaccine injury by the acellular pertussis vaccine regards the type of studies w ritten up in the medical literature Petitioner filed: he said they were all (but for Pet. Ex. 17, referred to in footnote 13, supra ) cell culture (in vitro ) studies, not animal ex perimen ts or human epidemiological studi es. Tr. I at 65. To him this was a critica l distinction: The in vivo model is muc h more complex. The in vivo model has many protec tive mecha nisms in place to make sure that things don't bother you. There 's other systems in there to make sure that the toxin doesn't do what it's supposed to do, that it doesn't g et to wher e it's suppose d to ge t to. Bec ause y ou are talking a bout some blood brain barrier components in a cell culture, it's not -- it's not the same thing as blood br ain barrier in the body itself which is a much more dy namic, and it's muc h more c omplicated and involved sy stem. Tr. I at 65-66. To Dr. Wiznitzer, because the effects descr ibed in in vitro studies are not seen in the in vivo mouse models, he conclude s that \"ther e is no plausible biologic construct that would support -18-[Dr. K insbourne's] hypothesis.\" Tr. I at 66. He noted later, a fortiori , what the absenc e of human epidemiolog ical evide nce por tends: [W]e don't have human da ta that tells tha t this is the expected outcome, tha t this i s wher e it is supposed to go. You can have an isolated seizure that can occur in temporal association with it. And if you had a tempera ture that is high enoug h, if you have a t rue febrile seizure, we know that it can provoke fe brile seizures. B ut there is no -- there 's no sequenc e that you can say, yes, I've had a febrile seizure, and because of the vaccine, that will develop into an epilepsy . Because even the research he cites in he re doe s not support that conclusion. Tr. I at 68. Discussing the strong role of genetic predisposition vis-\u00e0-vis vaccine causation, Dr. Wiznitzer stated, intere stingly : [F]or things like epileptic encephalopathies, is we now have more data and are able to identify genetic disorders that are associate d with epileptic encephalopathies, that these epileptic encephalopathies do have genetic bases that probably are not related in a causa l manner to the pertussis toxin, but are related to an underly ing genetic predisposition to seizures that is going to show itself at some time. It may be the fever that is prese nt from the immuniz ation that provokes that tendenc y. But, that was a tendenc y that was de stined to be there and would have occur red a nyway.14 Tr. I at 52. He reminded the Court that Evely n's mother had suffe red from a period of some seizure activity as a young child, which re solved it self, which to him suggested that \"ther e very well m ay be some unde rlying g enetics tha t are prese nt.\" Id. He did not view as dispositi ve the fact that Evelyn's SCN1A te sting found no genetic link: SCN1A is a mutation of one of the sodium channe ls. When a mutation occur s in that gene, and to my knowledge, there is at least 150 mutations of that gene that have been identified, as well as other problems that can occur besides mutations, that when it doesn't work right, the cells become hyperexcitable and are more prone to seizures. Her clinical picture is not classic for a child with typical SCN1A mutations, simply because, she' s continued to have seizures. Her -- be lieve it or not, her I Q is highe r than the typical -- althoug h, -- although , I have seen children with proven SCN1A mutations who have the same level of functioning and the same seizure pattern that she has. So, it's a minority that's there . If she had a mutation, the testing most likely would have identified, but it would not identify what's called a deletion, which means that you are missing bigger chunks of genetic materia l, which for technica l reasons, the mutation testing ca nnot look for -- c annot look for. Of the three Fates (\u00cc\u00ef\u00df\u00f1\u00e1\u00e9), both Dr. Kinsbourne and Dr. Wiznitzer seem to be in agreement about the role14 of Klotho (\u00ca\u00eb\u00f9\u00e8\u00fe) in Evelyn's seizures: that a predisposition to seizures at some point had been spun into Evelyn's thread. However, regarding the precisely-measured moment of time when a seizure would necessarily have occurred and its inevitability-the provinces of Lachesis (\u00cb\u00dc\u00f7\u00e5\u00f3\u00e9\u00f2) and Atropos (}\u00c1\u00f4\u00f1\u00ef\u00f0\u00ef\u00f2) respectively-the experts remain opposed. -19-But, there 's other -- there 's other reasons why you can have epilepsy. It's not just SCN1A, there 's SCN1B, there 's SCN2 A. Both of which are now available for testing. There may be testing in the future for GAB R1 and a whole slew of other channe lopathies that are known to cause epilepsy . And there 's even -- there is varia tions on a gene that cause s autosomal dominant frontal lobe epilepsy , which I don't think she has. Just to say that even that theore tically is something that you have to look for that's gene tic [in] nature . And t here's a whole sl ew of other ge nes that people ha ve now identifie d have a genetic basis. The re ason her e is that, it's not -- it's not logica l to surmise that an immuniz ation that contains a de toxified per tussis toxin, and even if we accept Dr. Kinsbourne' s premise from the article he quoted, that there is not complete detoxi fication, that there is still some active agent, there is a signific ant decrease in the amount of active agent, more likely than not leading to a lowering of the amount that's there , you know, below the necessary threshold, for causing any kind of an issue. And I would arg ue that that is probably true. Tr. I at 61-62. On the suspicion of genetic causa tion Dr. Wiznitzer gleane d from the medical records, he explained that when Evely n was tested for genetic mutatio ns that could be associate d with a predisposition for seizures, there were not then available the plethora of tests that now abound. Tr. I at 53. He pointed to treating neurolog ist Dr. Thiele in the medic al records a s agreeing w ith him, that \"ther e is an underly ing g enetic pr edete rmined basis to the seizures that needs to be checked.\" Id., citing Pet. Ex. 6 at 4-5. He explained the thought proce ss of the prudent neurolog ist confr onted with Evely n's prese ntation, that they would continue genetic testing to look for a genetic link, because \"this is the way they think and this is the way that they would approa ch things.\" Tr. I at 54- 55. On the contra ry, he did not believe that any of the treating neurologists believed vaccine causa tion to be a likely proposition. Tr. I at 55-56, c iting Pet. Ex. 4 at 12-13. Dr. Wiznitzer found signific ant the examination of family history that was the focus of Dr. Riviello, a treating neurolog ist: That means she had more than one seizure suggesting that there is some predisposition. Her mother has a predisposition to febrile seizures that she outgr ew. And i t also suggests, there is a strong -- there is a very strong suggestion that there is a genetic basis for that. Especia lly when you have a daug hter with seizures that are ongoing from infanc y. And as Dr. Riviello pointed out, the difficulty here is that, when you test for SCN1A gene mutation, that only explains approximately 10 to 15 percent of the f amilial febrile se izure population... Tr. I at 82. Howeve r, Dr. Wiznitzer did not believe the opinions of the treating neurologists to be dispositi ve simply beca use they witnessed the sy mptoms firsthand. I nstead, he explained that: I alway s come to conclusions on my own irrespe ctive of what other people say. You've got to keep an open mind when you look at things. You have to walk in, look at the records, and prete nd that there is a blank slate and ask yourself the -20-question, there's a problem here, what can be -- what can be the reason for the problem. Because , once you've fixed your mind on one idea, you get stuck and you very well may miss something that can be obvious in that regard. ... I listen to what other pe ople say , but I come to my own conc lusions. Tr. I at 58. Dr. Wiznitzer found the treaters assumption of genetic causa tion signific ant, because it demonstrated \"that they were thinking that there was an underlying genetic basis, even if they couldn't identify it.\" Tr. I at 60. Eventually , Dr. Wiznitzer's opinion took an intriguing turn; the following interchang e occur red on dire ct examination: Q ...Now, you had mentioned earlier on that vaccines can be associate d with fever, can cause feve r; is that -- is that corr ect? A Oh, y es. Ye s. In fac t, we know that. Tha t's a g iven. Q And does the D TaP ca use fe ver? A Yes. Q Okay. Compare d to the other vaccines, is it more or less likely to cause fever? A Compared to the DTP, it is less likely to cause fever. I think, some people believe, compar ed to the pneumococ cal vaccine, it is less likely to cause fever. Compared to the c hickenpox vaccine , it's more likely to cause feve r. ... Q So, do we know what cause d -- to the extent that Evely n had a low-g rade fever, do we know what c aused it? A We have two possibili ties. One is that the medical records tell us that the illness to -- the gastrointestinal illness that she had was associate d with a low-g rade fever that is documented in the discharg e summary from the initial hospital admission in Februa ry 2004. ... You've got two reasons why you can have fever. One is the pre-existing illness that you basica lly were seeing the last aspec ts of it provoking fever and causing vomiting the evening before , beca use she had had a gastrointestinal, and that was associated with vomiting and low-g rade fever. Or, she has fever due to the immuniz ation. And this is one of those things wher e you've got some complications here. And -- and you basica lly have to just look at it and say , here is the two possible reasons. Q But, the fever itself is not high enoug h, in your opinion, to be considere d a febrile seizure? A This is not a classic febrile seizure. This is a fever -- in this case, this wa s a fever assoc iated with seizure. -21-Q And why is that important to dis tinguish that fr om a fe brile seizure? A As Kinsbourne had stated befor ehand, when the tempera ture g oes up in individuals who are susceptible, whether it is due to a factor such as an intercur rent illness with viruses such as HHV6 or parvovirus, or if you have an underly ing genetic tendenc y, because it runs in the family , when the temp goes high enough, it can provoke a seizure. And we have found that when the temp -- the cutoff -- it is a somewhat arbitra ry cutoff, but it has been shown that this is probably a valid cutoff that when it's above --it's 102 and above, then it's most likely to be associate d with the entity we've define d as febrile seizure. When it's below that, while you still have a fever, it's re ally just a feve r assoc iated with seizure. And if I may, for instance, my patients with epilepsy -- with known epilepsy , they may not need 102\u00b0 tempera ture to provoke their seizures. Those with known epilepsy , I may just need to have a temp of 100 or 100.5 a nd that's all they need to set off their seizure. These are kids with a pre-existing tendenc y towards seizure wher e this is a sufficie nt stre ssor to provoke the seizure in tha t individual. But, the tendenc y is alrea dy there . Tr. I at 72-77. Dr. Wiznitzer reiter ated repeatedly that, if the vaccine (or any other challeng e) cause d a fever, which then stre ssed Evely n's sy stem enoug h to trigg er (or \"unmask\") the first seizure of a seiz ure disorder to which she was genetica lly predisposed, that would rende r the triggering agent irrele vant: THE COURT: So there fore, hypothetically , you could have a gastroente ritis causing a mild seizure -- I mean, causing a mild fever which cause s the seizure. Or, in the alterna tive, you could have a vaccination causing a mild fever which causes the seizure? THE WI TNESS: I n a per son who alre ady has a te ndency towards - - THE COURT: A g enetic pr edisposition. THE WITNESS: Who already has -- basica lly, and in my opinion, this is something that is destined to happ en. It's just a ticking time bomb destined to happen. It's going to ha ppen anyway. It doe sn't matter what the source of fever is, it's going to happen a nd it's going to follow that time line. THE COURT: But, can we say, would that seizure -- that first seizure have occur red when it did, if there had bee n no vacc ination? THE WITNESS: Can't say that, sir. Can't say that because, -- you're asking me, can seizure provoke fever. The answe r is yes. We also know that, after -- that children can develop seizures without fever. And we know that in her that that has happene d. That she has seizures without fever. So that you can't state that there is definitely -- that that was the ultimate provoca tion that -- in the absenc e of fever, you would not have ha d the seizure on that day . THE COURT: Okay . -22-THE WITNESS: And the reason I am saying that is, we look at her history later on, noting that you can have -- that she had seizures without fever. And there fore, if she has done it then, she c an eve n do it before hand. Tr. I at 78-79. He added that, inasmuch as (he believed) Evely n's tempera ture was not taken the day of her vaccinatio n, it was impossible for him to tell whether her prece ding ga strointestinal illness sparke d her he ighte ned temper ature , or if it was broug ht about by the vac cination. Tr. I at 80. He also raised the possibili ty, without e spousing it, that Evely n was suffe ring an active viral infec tion that could also have given rise to a f ever that trig gered the seizure. Tr. I at 81. Dr. Wiznitzer's primary direc t testimony conclude d with a discussion of the linkag e betwee n the her seizure disorder and neur ologic defic its: Here, she's not having the same frequency of the seizures that are recorded in some of these other populations. She's having some sporadic seizures here and there , little flurrie s. And then, there is a long time period betwee n them. And it's difficult to ascertain -- or I think, it's difficult to come to the conclusion to say it's definitely because you are having recurrent seizures that is causing -- that is causing the cognitive chang es. And the cognitive chang es you have are going to get worse over time. Versus just saying, you have some underly ing problem with the brain that cause s seizures, cause s these learning issues, and they become more manifest the older you get. When you're very young , when you are a six-month-old, when you are a year old, when you are a year and a half old or so, there is not enoug h to sample to really get an idea of wher e you are going to be cognitively . It's only when you're older that it bec omes much more e vident. Tr. I at 85-86. On cross-e xamination, Dr. Wiznitzer stated that, in 1984, the evidenc e would have led him to conclude that whole-c ell pertussis toxin could cause seizures, but that his perspe ctive has chang ed with the rising know ledge of g enetics, suc h that today , his opinion i s otherwise: But, this is 2008, ma'a m. This is not 1984. We now know that there are other reasons that you may have seizures besides -- that you may develop an epilepsy after a vac cination in which the va ccina tion unmasks the e pilepsy , but does not cause it, and does not a lter the g eneral history of the disorde r. Tr. I at 90. In addition, he alluded to a study of presumed child suffe rers of \"presumed pertussis encephalopathy ,\" which found a genetic c omponent in a majority of those childre n, which led Dr. Wiznitzer to conclude , \"In other words, it was not the pertussis vaccine that cause d it. It was probably the fever provoked the pertussis vaccine that basica lly unmasked something that was going to happen a nyway.\" Tr. I at 91. This led to another puissant exchang e: THE COURT: Would it be fair to say, from that -- from your perspe ctive, that y ou would say yes, A, pe rtussis can ca use a f ever and the f ever can c ause the seizures? THE WI TNESS: That is a give n, Special Master . -23-THE C OURT: And B , if I understand the term y ou just used, t hat particularly , the pertussis component ca n unmask a pre -existi ng problem? THE WI TNESS: I t's not the pertussis. I t's the fe ver. THE COURT: Okay . So -- THE WITNESS: And I think it's very important, Special Master, to think of it that way. It's the fever. Because , it doesn't matter what cause s the fever. There 's nothing unique. I t's just reg ular fe ver. I t unmasks something that was going to be unmasked any way at some time or another , either with fever or without fever. It was just that, at that point i n time, it broug ht it out now rather than a week from now, a month from now, or thre e months from now. THE COURT: Or it could have been a week prior? Or a week befor e -- or a month befor e? THE WITNESS: Or a week prior. Whatever it would be. But, this was something that was destined to happen. And in those cases that were descr ibed in the medical literature , their clinical prese ntation of those individuals was really no differ ent than the ones that are not pertussis associate d. That there was no altera tion of the natura l history of any kind. Tr. I at 92. This conver sation with the Court continued a little later: THE COURT: Okay . So there fore, among st the theories on the table would be that, the seizure was unmasked, to use your term, by a fever which was cause d by or unmasked by a gastroente ritis. Or, if y ou use Dr. Kinsbourne' s theore m, then by a vaccination? THE WITNESS: Well, but not by -- not by pertussis toxin. But, we'll say by -- if you're going to ask me, sure, I agree vaccinations can provoke fever. And I had already answe red here in the court that -- that one of the possible reasons for the fever that was prese nt on the morning of the 12th was the vaccination. I would also agree with that statement. Tr. I at 98-99. And althoug h genetic testing did not specify which gene's mutation predisposed Evely n's seizure disorder, Dr. Wiznitzer firmly stood by genetic causa tion as a causa l factor unrela ted to the vac cine, to a r easona ble pre pondera nce: I can't say that she has those mutations. Howeve r, I can say that it is more likely than not that there is something genetic going on because of the family history of febrile seizure. Q Okay . But y ou can't -- you can't actually point to anything? At this point, it's just speculation on y our par t? A It's not specula tion, ma'a m. It's a logic al sequenc e of thinking, using data that we have available for us , that's readily available in the m edica l literature , that we know that -- as Dr. Riviello had written, the history is suggestive of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus, because the mother has history of febrile seizure. -24-And there 's multipl e reasons for GEF S plus, some of which we can test for, many of which we can't, because we don't know what they are. And in this basis, if you were going to ask me the most likely reason why she has her seizures, I would say it's because of a genetic pr edisposition. Tr. I at 100. In a word, it seems the sticking point for Dr. Wiznitzer is what the law refers to as proximity of cause, the relative logic al connection that a cause in fa ct has to the eventual result. He seemed to say that what had been thought to be a close relationship (betwe en pertussis vaccine and seizure) was not re ally that close a t all: Q So, you're saying that, based upon the knowledg e that we have today in 2008, that you would disag ree with the conclusions of the NCES as well as the IOM repor t that looked at the NCES and said that there were -- there were sever e conseque nces to the whole ce ll DPT vaccine ? A No. There are sever e conseque nces. There are seizures that occur that are provoked by the fever and everything. I agree with all that.... But, the real question is, we're talking about the epileptic encephalopathy , the persistent epilepsies that can occur , wher e it was ascribed - - a causal re lationship was ascribed -- i t was actually -- really, what we're talking about here is an association, an association betwee n the vaccine and the e nsuing e pilepsy . Tr. I at 94. Revisiting the earlier discussion of febrile versus afebrile seizure categorization, Dr. Wiznitzer believed that a lower- tempera ture fever could trigger a seizure in someone with a genetic predisposition to seiz ures: [O]n a theore tical basis, a tempera ture of 100.8 it may -- may provoke it. And if you have a n underly ing e pilepsy tendenc y already, let's just -- in fac t, let's g o back a nd use a simpler word. If you have an underly ing seizure tendenc y, irrespe ctive of what it is, you don't need a temp of 103.... Low-g rade fever is sufficie nt to provoke -- once it's already there , and the source of the fever is immaterial. It's not because you got damag e to the brain. It's not because you are damag ing neurons. It's not because you are chang ing the ratio of excitatory to inhib itory neurons, it's just fever period that can do tha t. And it's something that wa s going to ha ppen any way . Tr. I at 101-102. On redire ct, Dr. Wiznitzer \" and full-fledg ed causa tion, in the context of this case : Dr. Kinsbourne' s hypothesis is that pertussis toxin leaks into the brain, damag es neurons, cause s a chang e in the excitatory to the inhibitory ratio of neurona l function. And there fore, cause s [] seizures to occur and esta blishes an epilepsy that is there . In other words, something causing means that whateve r the substance is, or whateve r the event is, or whatever the factor is about which we are speaking , it is the reason -25-why the seizures ar e happe ning. And in the abse nce of that fac tor, the child would never have de veloped se izures of any type. Tr. I at 103. The Court note s the simil arity betwee n Dr. Wiznitzer's explanation and test of legal \"cause in fact\" analy sis. There after, Dr. Wiznitzer provided a few examples of his meaning of cause , most of which the law would categorize as \"super seding causa l factors.\" Tr. I at 104. To Dr. Wiznitzer, genetic predisposition fits within this category, which is distinct from \"unmasking \": It cause s the epilepsy . It's going to happen period, because you've got the problem. There is a differ ence versus unmasking or bring ing out. In some of these conditions, they are going to occur anyway. But, an example -- let's assume you get a fever. And that t hey are going to occur w ith or without the fever . It doesn't matter if y ou get the fever or not. The fever just happens to make -- to lower the seizure threshold. You've already got the tendenc y that's there . And it bring s out the seizure tendenc y that is going to show itself any way. Whether it is going to show itself at ag e thre e months, whether it's going to show itself at age four months, six months, eight months, 10 months, 12 months, it will show itself. That to me is what I mean by unmasking . Tr. I at 105. Dr. Wiznitzer's initial testimony was conclude d with a brief summation initiated by the Court's restate ment and quer y: THE COURT: The Court understands Dr. Wiznitzer's position that there is -- there was a n underly ing g enetic issue. THE WI TNESS: An underly ing disorde r. We'll just say that sort of -- THE COURT: An under lying disorde r. THE WI TNESS: Genetics is an explanation. THE COURT: And presumably , that was provoked, revealed, unmasked, howeve r one wants to put it, by the m ild fever which was 100.8 or less and that it would've happene d if it did not happen at that point in time. It would've happene d to -- it could've happene d antec edent or it could have happene d a week or a year or five years later. I t would've ha ppened a t some point. THE WITNESS: It wouldn't have been five years though, Special Master. It probably would've happene d in the months after. More likely than not, it would've happene d in the months after. ... [I]n my opinion, this was something that was destined to occ ur. Ha d they not occur red on F ebrua ry 12, 2004, y ou still would've had the subsequent seizures. The seizures that happene d later on would still have happene d at points in ti me. Tr. I at 107-109. -26-At the second hearing, Dr. Wiznitzer had much to say about Dr. Kinsbourne' s prese ntation of the toxoi ding pr ocess use d for the a cellular pertussis vacc ine. First, he gave a clear explanation of the functions of the so-terme d \"A\" and \"B\" \"branch\" of the per oxin: [T]here are two steps to toxins. Number one is the toxin has to bind at the site at which it's going to act, and number two is that then the toxin has to do its action. Binding occur s with the B subunit, action occur s with the A subunit, which is the enzymatically active portion. There fore, I'm going to basica lly reiter ate my position that if you can't show up wher e you're supposed t o, you can't do any harm, which means if you can't bind, you can't do any kind of your enzyme activity and do whateve r the toxi n is supposed to do. Tr. II at 20. Later, he define d what he saw to be the disputed issues separ ating his opinion from Dr. Kinsbourne: [P]ertussis toxin not only has to have intact A units, the A unit or the A subunit, which is the enz yme function, but it also has to have intact B subunit, which is the binding to the cell subunit, in order to really function as a toxin. And if you can make that, the B subunit nonfunctional, which means you can't show up wher e you're supposed to and you can't stay wher e you're supposed to, if you don't do that, then the toxin basica lly still doesn't work. And our original argument that it's detoxi fied holds. Dr. Kinsbourne then comes back and says wait, you can't inactivate the B subunit because if you do inactivate the B subunit, you destroy ed the ability of that pertussis toxin to pr ovoke an immune r esponse. That was my reading of it, and I read it into the record just before. All the rest of the article s that I submitt ed were basica lly stating that's not true. You do not have to have intact B subunit function in order to provoke an immune response . If that's not correct, basica lly his initial hypothesis does not hold. Tr. II at 40-41. Dr. W iznitzer expanded his comments on this topic by commenting that the articles relied upon by Dr. Kinsbourne were in vitro studies, instead of in vivo studies, which he thought l imited its applicability to the question at hand. Tr . II at 22-24. The crux of this c riticism is that the mere evidenc e of ineffe ctive toxoiding or reversion does not require the conclusion that the toxin is therefore just as virulent as whole-c ell pertussis toxin that has not underg one toxoiding at all, because the toxoiding pr ocess may still have been able to disa ble the toxin suf ficiently to render it harmless, by disabling either the A or B branc h of the toxin, both of which are necessary for the toxin effectively to inflict damag e akin to the whole-c ell form. Tr. II at 24-25. Without in vivo data of the effects on live subjects of such toxoided forms, Dr. Wiznitzer would not be persua ded of the medical plausibilit y of ac ellular pe rtussis vaccine injury . Tr. I I at 26. According to Dr. Wiz nitzer, the article of m edica l literature Petitioner f iled as Pet. Ex. 41, Tab A stated that the purpose of retaining B branc h function intact is to enhanc e immune response -27-to the other, active antigens in the vaccine (including , presumably , the A branc h of the pertussis toxin), ac ting more as an a djuvant than as a n integ ral mec hanistic portion of the pe rtussis tox in. 15 Tr. II at 26-27. This argument strikes the Court as orthog onal, since Dr. Kinsbourne did at no time claim the B branc h was mere ly an adjuvant, but agreed that the B branch was an integ ral, functionally -necessar y part of the pertussis tox in. Dr. Wiznitzer defended the article he had filed, which Dr. Kinsbourne pointed out had been prospec tive about research possibili ties and not descr iptive of current industry -wide manufa cturing methods at the time it was written, by saying that the paper proved that the B branc h did not need to be pre sent to incite immune response le ading to immuni ty: It was meant to counter Dr. Kinsbou rne's argument that you neede d an intact B oligomer or B subunit in order to have the vaccine work proper ly, because if I can counter that argument, it then supports the point that detoxi fying the A subunit or the B subunit or bot h basically can lead to total dysfunction i f you want to call it from a functional standpoint of the toxin but not loss of its immune-provoking proper ty. In other wor ds, the antig en is still t here, but the function is g one. Tr. II at 28-29. Howeve r, he later conce ded that, inasmuch as the article 's authors stated that a manufacturing proce ss of disabling the B branc h instead of the A branc h \"has been succe ssfull y develope production,\" to Dr. Wiznitzer, \"that is wher e we're going nowadays, to use the more uniform gene tically modified pertussis toxin.\" Tr. II at 34, discussing Resp. Ex. G. Neve rtheless, what Dr. Wiznitzer viewed as the critica l point made by that article was that the B branc h is \"not essential to provoke antibody and immune response to the pertussis vaccine.\" Id. The Court saw this digression as somewhat tangential, inasmuch as the activity of the B branc h in Dr. Kinsbourne' s theory is not controve rsial, and is not centr al; also, given the of manufa cturing proce dures at the time Evely n's dose was produce d, there is better than even odds that her dose of the acellular pertussis vaccine was chemica lly toxoided. Dr. Wiznitzer did not opine on what could result if the B branc h was not deleted, and the A branc h was imperfectly disabled, whether the toxin might retain the propensity for adver se effects associate d with whole-c ell pertussis. Dr. Wiznitzer also criticized one of the c itations in an article f iled by Petitioner discussing reversion of the pe rtussis tox in following the toxoiding pr ocess: In reality, the article addresses adjuvant function as a secondary function for the B branch of the pertussis15 toxin, that its primary effect is to attach the toxin to receptor sites: The B oligomer component of the toxin has a pentametric structure which mediates the binding of the toxin to glycoprotein receptors on the surface of eukaryotic cells and induces polyclonal T cell activation. It has been reported that [pertussis toxin] possesses adjuvant properties [and] has been shown to potentiate both local and systemic antibody responses... These findings suggest that the adjuvanticity of [pertussis toxin] may be associated with enhanced production of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines.... Pet. Ex. 41, Tab A (Mark Ryan et al., Pertussis toxin potentiates Th1 and Th2 responses to co-injected antigen: adjuvant action is associated with enhanced regulatory cytokine production and expression of the co-stimulatory molecules B7-1, at 652. -28-When we look at the reference for no. 22, it's a reference about choler a toxin and their potential reversion. It's not a reference about pertussis toxin and its reversion. What they were saying is that hypothetically it happens with other toxins, and the conce rn her e is that it also can ha ppen with the per tussis t oxin. Tr. II at 29. He a dded that \"one of the thing s that manufac turers of vacc ines are obliga ted to do is to continually test vaccine lots after they're produce d and befor e they go out to make sure that reversion doesn't occur .\" Tr. II at 30. Later on, he stated conce rning the same article that \"ther e's no proof in this article itself that it's something that commonly happens with pertussis toxin,\" while also reiter ating that it is a potentiality which vaccine manufa cture rs monitor to preve nt. Tr. II at 36. He reconc iled these statements by concluding , \"The refore, while hypothetically Dr. Kinsbourne's statements might be right, prac tically speaking it did not occur bec ause of what the manuf actur ers do.\" Tr. I I at 37. On cross-e xaminat ion at the second hearing, the conver sation once again turned to Dr. Wiznitzer's parsing of causa tion wher e a DTaP vaccine cause d a fever that triggered a seizure which led to an eve ntual seizure disorder : Q Dr. Wiznitzer, would you agree that the DTaP vaccination can cause seizures? A I would agree -- well, let's turn it around and say it this way. One, DTaP vaccinations can be associate d with seizures, and it has been because that's been repor ted. In the studies that have been done, the rate of seizures with DTaP is usually no highe r than the r ate of seizures with DT vac cine. Tha t's number one . Number two, I would also agree that if DTaP vaccine provokes a fever, then that fever, just like fever of any kind, fever from illness, fever from heat overe xposure if I put you in a hot bath, if I put you out in the sun so that I overheat you, in people who are already susceptible towards seizures, in other words, people who are destined to have a seizure anyway because fever provokes it, that that fever just like any other fever can do it. There 's nothing specia l about that fever, and it would not alter the clinical course of that underly ing seizure tendenc y just because the fever came from the vaccine. That's differ ent than saying that the vaccine cause s brain -- which wa s repr esente d to the Court today . Tr. II at 46. Respondent's redire ct examination of Dr. Wiznitzer tease d out a nuance to this opinion: Q You said that DTaP has been associate d with seizures when Ms. Ho asked you is there evidenc e that DTaP cause s seizures. Are you making a distinction betwee n associate d and ca used, and if so, w hat is it? A Yes, I'm making a diffe rence. Cause means that the vaccine itself does something, that the vaccine, something specia l about the vaccine does something to cause a seizure. Dr. Kinsbourne has already basica lly proffered his hypothetical argument in that what it does is it cause s some event wher e it gets to the centr al nervous system, cause s damag e and there fore provokes something. That is not what I'm claiming . -29-What happens is when you look at studies that have been done, that if you give immuniz ations to kids with DTaP and then you follow them for a period of time afterwards, there 's a number of kids who are going to have seizures that occur . And that just means that that's because this ha ppened with a temporal association, but it does not mean c ausal a ssociation. The situation wher e we know there is an indirect relationship of that type is when the immu nization provokes a fever, and the fever, like any other fever from any other source , nothing specia l about it, with no altera tion of the clinical course of the condition, but that fever provokes a seizure in an individual who is going to have seizures provoked by fever anyway, that's the only one wher e we clearly have definitive and g ood data to support it. ... And if you already have a t endenc y towards seiz ures provoked by fever, that fever like any other fever can cause a seizure, but it does not cause an epilepsy . It just provokes a seizure. Tr. II at 47-48, 51. Dr. Wiznitzer conclude d his testimony by explaining why he thought DTP and DTaP vaccines wer e too diffe rent to wa rrant comparison: Whole-cell pertussis vaccine has a lot of antig ens in it, many , many antig ens in it that are not prese nt in the DTaP. DTaP basica lly only has usually two, maybe three or four a ntige ns just related to per tussis. I t's a ver y clean vacc ine in that reg ard. But you're going to get reactions to vaccines because there 's a limit ed number of reactions monitored for that you can possibly get. The reasons for those reactions have not necessarily been alway s well define d, but to state that because the reaction occur s to whole-c ell DTP and then the same kind of an event occur s after DTaP they must have the same causa l mecha nism when there are differ ent components and altere d components within the DTaP vaccine I think is basica lly not supported by the medical litera ture. I t's hy pothetical. Tr. II at 48-49. C. M EDICAL LITERATURE In this case, inasmuch as a fundame ntal dispute betwee n the par ties' experts hinge on the \"can it\" prong of tical plausibilit y of Petitioner's theory of causa tion, the medical literature filed by the parties seems appropr iate to summarize. Some citation and quotation was provided supra and will not be reduplicated. Simi larly, not all of the medical literature was relevant to the disputed issues at hand, so the C ourt will sort as best as it can. In almost all of them, the interna l citations have be en omitted. The most important article to Petitioner's primary theory of causa tion is Pet. Ex. 19, Br\u00fcckene r et al. (supra at note 8). The study is summariz ed as f ollows: -30-Respiratory tract infec tions cause d by Bordetella pertussis are occasionall y accompanied by sever e neurolog ic disorders and encephalopathies. For these sequela e to occur the integri ty of cerebral barriers needs to be compromised. The influence of pertussis toxin, a decisive virulence factor in the pathog enesis of pertussis disease, on barrier int egrity was investig ated in model sy nd blood-brain ( endothelial) barriers. Whil e pertussis toxin did not influence the barrier function in Plexus chorioideus model systems, the integ rity16 of cerebral endothelial monolay ers was sever ely compromised. Cellular17 iintoxication by pertussis toxin proce eds via ADP-ribosy lation of \u00e1-G proteins, which not only interfe res homeostatic inhibitory regulation of adeny late cyclase stimul ation but also results in a modulation of the membra ne re ceptor coupling . Pet. Ex. 19 at 1837. Pertussis toxin is used to initiate experimental autoimmune encephalomy elitis, a lab-introduce d mammalian disease used to study auto-immune disorders in humans. \"The mecha nism by which [pertussis toxin] might enhance the development of EAE has not been elucidate d but it appea rs to involve an incre ase of the vascular permeability of the blood-brain- barrier.\" Id. at 1838. The study took note of, but did not study , the differ ence in effect betwee it been repor ted that whole-c ell but not acellular pertussis vaccine induced convulsive activity in mice . This c ould be also induced by the administration of active [pertussis toxin] and LPS, which is residually prese nt in the whole-c ell vaccine but is absent in the acellular vaccine.\" Id. at 1843. The results of the study led to a chorioideus consists of \"vascular fringelike folds of the pia mater ... concerned with production16 of the cerebrospinal fluid;\" also called choroid plexi, they are \"infoldings of blood vessels of the pia mater covered by a thin coat of ependymal cells that form tufted projections into the third [tertii], fourth [quarti], and lateral [lateralis] ventricles of the brain and they secrete the cerebrospinal fluid [CSF].\" DORLAND'S, supra at note 3, at 1453-54. Endothelial monolayers are single layer sheets of endothelial cells arranged that way for the study of viruses17 et al. Endothelial cells are epithelial cells that line heart cavity and blood and lymph vessels, as well as some other (serous) body cavities. DORLAND'S, supra at note 3, at 616, 1170. That study seemed to equate the endothelial layer of cells with the blood-brain barrier, and to use the terms almost interchangeably. The authors also contextualized that study within the body of existing literature:18 While the enzymatic activity of the S1 subunit is clearly needed for the induction of the disease conflicting reports implicate the B-oligomer subunits as well as the S1 subunit of PT to be involved in the protective effect of PT against EAE. The dual role of PT observed in vivo might be due to the particular PT concentration available locally as at higher PT concentrations elevated cAMP levels proved to reduce the permeability. Furthermore, as the protective effect of the B-oligomer of PT in EAE might be due to the S2/S3-mediated inhibition of leukocyte adherence to selectins on inflamed endothelial cells, elevated PT concentrations might enhance this effect. Thus, with regard to the induction of encephalopathies as a potential consequence of pertussis infection, ... PT might exert a dual effect in permeabilizing cerebral endothelial barriers mediated by the activity of the ADP-ribosyltransferase and, by contrast, mediating an anti-inflammatory effect by competitively blocking leukocyte adherence and recruitment.

Howeve r, the number of subjects who have received DTaP vaccines to date has been too small to calculate the risk of extremely rare but potentially life-thre atening reactions (e.g., immediate anaphy laxis, encephalopa thy). Moreove r, the moderately sever (e.g., tempera ture exceeding episodes, repor ted with use of whole-c ell DTP vaccine have also been observed with use of DTaP vacc ine. Pet. Ex. 21 (Dennis A.

Another article submitt ed by Petitioner tracked children who had reacted to DTaP vaccines, which noted se izures as one of those reaction events: Seven children with seizures within 7 days of DTaP vaccination were identified. All were young er than 2 years of age, and none had a prior history of seizures. Six had febrile seizures, three occur red within 2 days of vaccination and one of those require d hospita lization.

One child had an afebrile seiz ure after the second dose of DTaP vaccine given conc urrently with othe r vaccinations a t age 5 months.

Petitioners also filed a follow-up study that tracked the participa nts of the famous NCES study , which discussed the interplay of genetics in c hildren with seizure disorder s: Gene tic factors may contribute to children' s susceptibility to convulsions. Most authors repor t that those affected are more likely than others to have a first-deg ree relative who has or has had a simil ar condition, though the association is found in only a minority of cases. ... Evidence on whether or not sever ity is associate d with in different countries. Whole-cell vaccines were not only not standardized between manufacturers, but also, one suspects, varied with the same manufacturer from one lot to the next. This is reflected in the marked differences in antibody response to pertussis vaccination. From the wealth of case reports and studies attempting to understand the relationship, if any, between whole-cell pertussis immunization and permanent brain damage, the Institute of Medicine has offered three conclusions: (a) DPT administration causes a serious acute neurologic illness and subsequent permanent neurologic dysfunction in children who otherwise would not have experienced either acute or chronic neurologic illness; (b) DPT vaccination triggers an acute and subsequently a chronic neurologic illness in children with an underlying brain abnormality; and (c) DPT vaccination causes an acute neurologic illness in children with underlying brain abnormalities that would eventually have led to chronic neurologic disease even in the absence of the acute, DPT-initiated neurologic illness. Id. Of note, the vaccine was seen by the IOM as a cause of acute adverse reaction even in cases where underlying abnormalities would have eventually led to the onset of chronic illnesses of similar type. -33-strong er or weaker familial links is conflicting . ... A strong er relationship has been suggested for febrile convulsions.

Chemical inactivation, althoug h currently the most common approach , is not the ideal proce ss since the proce ss needs to be carefully controlled to ensure that toxoided material contains low levels of residual toxin . It must maintain suff icient che mical/structural integrity to elicit an acceptable immunogenic response and have a low reversion rate to a pathog enic component with time. Consequently , pertussi s vaccines are currently assessed for safety and/or pertussis toxin using sever al differ ent empirica l safety test methods such as: the mouse weig ht gain (MWG) test, the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell clustering test. There is a high degree of variabilit y in these tests. Pet.

That paper went on to explain that ADP-Ribosy lation is the penultimate s tep of purported pertussis toxin action (i.e., the B oligomer attache s to the targeted cells, the A (S1) unit is transloca ted to pe netra te the targeted cells, and the A (S1) unit da mages the normal func tioning of the targeted cells). Id. at 88. The study 's finding s indicated \"trace ribosy lation a ctivity \" in certain vaccine components, including the B oligomer component, which the authors thought \"could be -34-attributed to contamination from pertussi s toxin and/or the A protomer during the co-pur ification proce ss.\" Id. at 92. I n their discussion section, the a uthors stated: It is conce ivable that during the toxoiding proce ss only the pentamer is deactivated; the A subunit is unaff ected and continues to possess ribosy lation activity (intrinsic activity ) and of ribosy lating nd initiating the ca scade of adver se events, should it be transloca ted across the cell membrane .

These data suggested that toxoiding processe s used by different manufacturer are not equivalent with respec t to their ability to deactivate pertussis toxin S1 ribosylation, and indeed within a single manufacturer large variations exist. Id. at 94-95 (e mphasis added) . Another hotly debate d article that was filed by Petitioners (referred to as the \"Gomez\" article ) also addre ssed the conce pt of retained toxicity in the pertussis toxoid due to manufa [pertussis toxin] is able to induce IL-1 production in the mouse brain. IL-1 can affect neuroe ndocrine functions and modulate release of neurotra nsmitt ers, and has been claimed to play a role in neurolog ical reactions observe d in children immunis ed with pertussis vaccines of high [pertussis toxin] content. Although the biologica l effects of [pertussis toxin] have been under extensive resea rch, the mecha of its tox icity is stil l unclear ....

Another article filed by Respondent tested whether the A (S1) subunit could be genetica lly deleted, leaving only the B oligomer , and whether just the B oligomer would be enoug h to summon an immune re sponse suffic ient to be used a s a per tussis vaccine pr imary component: Since pertussis toxin has potent biologica l activity , it must be inactivated in a manner which retains its immunogenic ity befor e it can be considere d for inclusion in -37-vaccines. One approa ch that has been used for detoxi fication of the molecule involves chemica lly modify ing the protein with formalde hyde or glutaralde hyde. A second approac h might be to isolate a par t of the molecule which it self is nontox ic yet which would induce a neutra lizing antibody response to the native toxin. Such an approa ch has the advanta ge that the molecule is not toxic and there fore need not be chemica lly modified, thus prese rving epitopes on the molecule. Moreove r, conver sion a toxic form is wher eas chemica lly inactivated toxins can revert to toxic forms. A candida te for such an immunogen is the B oligomer , which lacks the enzymatically active portion of pertussis toxin. The development of a mild proce dure for [chemically ] dissociating the A subunit from the B oligomer and obtaining the B oligomer in high yields has made such an approa ch possible. ... In this study we have examined the ability of the isolated B oligomer of pertussis toxin to induce a ne utralizing antibody response in mice. Resp. Ex. H (Juan L. Arcinega et al., Immune Response to the B oligomer of Pertussis Toxin , 55(5) INFECTION AND IMMUNITY, 1132-36 (1987) ) at 1132. The results of that study were at odds with results of a simil ar study performed by others. The a uthors elabor ate: The B oligomer or . against B oligomer were able to neutra lize the action of pertussis toxin. ... We found that the B oligomer did not exhibi t the leukocy tosis-promoting and histamin e-sensitiz ing activities of pertussis toxin, finding s which contra st with the conclusions of Nogimori et al., who attributed these a ctivities to the B-olig omer. Id. at 1133-34. I n their discussion, the ar ticle's author s discuss their results: Antibodies to the B oligomer may neutra lize the activity of the holotox in by preve nting its binding to CHO cells. ... The B oligomer did not appea r to be superior to inactivated pertussis toxin as an immunogen, as might be expected since inactivated pertussis toxin was chemica lly modified. Thus, the major advanta ge of using the B oligomer as a component in a vaccine would be the inability of this protein to revert to the enzymatically active form of the toxin, which has previously been repor ted with chemica lly modified toxins. Results from this study demonstrate that the B oligomer can produce a neutra lizing antibody response in mice. The A subunit is also a potential vaccine candida te. Theore tically , the use of the A subunit might involve some risk, since thi s protein retains enzymatic ac tivity , althoug h the ability of the A subunit to enter a eucaryotic cell should be decreased in the absenc e of the B oligomer . Our preliminary attempts to use the A subunit a s an immunogen have met with discourag ing results. Not only have we had problems freeing A subunit pre parations fr om c ontaminating B oligomer , but w e have found that the A subunit appea rs to be a poor i mmunoge n in mice. Other workers have found that a monoclonal antibody to the A subunit neutra lized many of the activities of the holotox in, including its leukocy tosis-promoting activity , wher eas a monoclonal antibody to the B olig omer ha d no eff ect on these activities. -38-Id. at 1135. The end of the article looks forwa rd to the possibili ty (in futuro in 1987) of genetica lly deleting components of the va ccine to make them saf er: Rece ntly, the genes encoding the pertussis toxin subunits were cloned. It is there fore conce ivable that a B. pertussis strain which lacks the gene for the \"toxi c\" A subunit may now be engineer ed using recombinant DNA techniques. Such an approa ch has the advanta ge that the B oligomer could be purified from these strains without the possibili ty of conta mination with holot oxin. Id. The next of Respondent's article s of medical literature was a follow-up study conce rning children w ho suffe red a cute ne urolog ic illnesses associa ted with pertussis vacc ine: Over 80% of cases and controls were traced. Case children were signific antly more likely than controls to have died or to have some form of e ducational, be havioura l, neurolog ical, or physical dysfunction a decade after their illness. The preva lence of one or more of these adver se outcomes in case children who had been immunised with diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine within seven days befor e onset of their original illnes s was simil ar to that in case children who had not been immunis ed recently. ... Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine may on rare occasions be associate d with the development of sever e acute neurolog ical illnesses that can have serious sequela e. Some cases may occur by chanc e or have other cause s. The role of pertussis vaccine as a prime or concomitant factor in the aetiolog y of these illnesses cannot be deter mined in any individual case.

This seems to be as true for cases associate d in time with diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunis ation as for other cases. Howeve r, children with acute neurolog ical illnesses, whether associate d with vaccine or not, may have had a prior occult underly ing condition that could have incre ased their susceptibility to external insults but that was not recognised at the time. A simple viral illness or immunis ation with pe rtussis va ccine cause feve r and sy stemic upset, which in a susceptible child can provoke sever e convulsions or encephalopathic symptoms. Furthermore , the ultimate outcom e of what might have been a relatively innocent illness may be influenc ed by the pre sence of under lying pa thology ....

It is interesting that toxin molecules used in current acellular vaccine formulations are often inactivated by treatments with formalde hyde or glutaralde hyde, chemica ls that primarily affect lysine residues in proteins.

This approa ch is particularly useful for the development of new generation vaccines against infec tious diseases mediated by bacte rial toxins. of the [pertussis toxin] gene prese nted in this study clearly demonstrate that altera tions of the receptor-binding sites strong ly affect the biologica l activities of [pertussis toxin].

Petitioners argue that sever al of Evely n's \"treating physicians associated Evely n's seizures with he r vaccines.\" This argument seems an odd primary focus, inasmuch as all such associations were mere mentions in reciting her history of onset, and were not purportments of causa l association. Stated otherwise, any association betwee n Evely n's vaccination and her seizures were statements of temporal association, not causal association. Petitioners are expected to understand the differ ence.24 2. Petitioners recapitulated the testimo ny of Dr. Kinsbourne and the supportive medical literature filed in this matter, and argued, without much more, that it was more persuasive than Respondent's expert and litera ture. 25 3. Petitioners ended their closing brief in chief by citing to other Prog ram decisions that found that \"the DTaP vaccine can cause seizures and brain damag e,\" by pointing out the close temporal association betwee n vaccination and the onset of seiz ures (24 hours), which none of the treating doctors or expert witnesses have questioned as not being medically appropr iate, and by pointing out the relative absenc e of other external immune challeng es that were likely causes (or triggers) of Evely n's seizures. 26 4. The most helpful and relevant argument made by Petitioners' closing brief was in its last paragraph, on pa ge 36: [A]ll vaccine injuries have a genetic base. Susceptibilit y alway s plays a role. Indeed, the Federal Circuit has held, non-vac cine environmenta l factors contr ibute to the injury . In such circumstances, when concur rent forces cause a single harm, the Federal Circuit has held, the burden is on [Respondent] to show that the alterna tive cause is so predominant that the vaccine is insignifica nt. See Shyface v. Sec'y of HHS , 165 F.3d 1344, 1352- 53 (F ed. Cir. 1999). The refore, the Court has st ated, if evidenc e establishes equally plausible etiologie s for an injury then the petitioner The Court surmises that Petitioners employed this argument to take advantage of the Federal Circuit's24 opinions in Capizzano v. Sec'y of HHS, 440 F. 3d 1317 (2006), and Andreu v. Sec'y of HHS, 569 F. 3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Any such reliance is misplaced where, as here, the treating doctors' opinions do not affirmatively and explicitly support vaccine causation. The Court notes its disappointment that Petitioners left almost untouched the legal issues raised by this25 Petition, focusing instead on summarizing and reiterating the testimonial evidence proffered at trial. Petitioners also argued that no alternative causal factor was identified by either the treating doctors or by Dr.26 Wiznitzer. This recitation is only accurate if one ignores genetic predisposition as a causal factor, the contention held, certainly by Dr. Wiznitzer, and arguably by one or more treating neurologists. It would have been helpful if Petitioners had provided the Court with a thoroughgoing argument why genetic predisposition is or is not a sufficient alternative or superseding cause, or the legal significance of its interplay with sensitivity to a challenge like the vaccine, an interplay stipulated by both parties' experts. -41-should preva il. See Knudsen v. Sec'y of HHS , 35 F.3d 543, 550 (Fed. Cir. 1994). In such cases, [Respondent] must eliminate the vaccine as a substantial contributing factor. See Shy face, 165 F.3d a t 1353. 5. Respondent pointed out that none of Evely n's treating doctors (a) diagnosed febrile seizures, (b) implicated any vaccination f or the seizures, or (c) were able to deter mine the cause of the seizures. To this, Respondent adds that \"all of her physicians agree that the cause of her seizures is unknown, althoug h a g enetic c ause is suspec ted.\" 6. Respondent argues, in response to Petitioners' primary \"assoc iation\" argument, that \"In taking their respe histories, some of [the treating] physicians noted that Evely n received a DTaP vaccination befor e her seizures began, but none drew any conclusion as to causa tion. In fact, those who consider ed the va ccina tion as a possible ca use dismissed it as a ca usal fac tor.\" 7. Respondent quotes at length from the Court's decision in Simon v. Sec'y of HHS , 0941V, 2007 WL 1772062 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Jun. 1, 2007) to argue that Dr. Kinsbourne was wrong to ext rapola te from the N CES st udy to analog ize the injury at issue in this P etition. 8. Respondent argues that Petitioner has only provided a \"hypothetical model\" that lacks a plausible theory or an e xplanation as to how that theory was at work in the instant c ase throug h \"a logic al seque nce of cause and ef fect betwee n the vac cination and the injury .\" 9. Respondent claimed that Dr. Wiznitzer's testimony proved the point, that \"DTa P vaccines contain pertussis toxin that has been detoxi fied and made chemica lly inactive. Its functional proper ties as a toxin have been eliminated ... Dr. Kinsbourne simply could not demonstrate that there is sufficient re sidual tox in function in DTaP vac cine to provoke Evely n's seizure disorder . II. ULTIMATE FINDINGS OF FACT Both parties' experts w ere persona lly and profe ssionally credible; tha t premise is beyond a cavil of doubt in the Court's mind. Having heard both experts on numerous occasions over the preceding years, the C ourt was again impressed by the knowledge of each, and of their command over the subject m atter addresse d. They both comported themselves as professionals of class and academic distinction. Howeve r, the way to address whether an expert witness has proff ered a credible, reliable theory , that logic ally confor ms to the specific facts of the case, is to assess the theories of causa tion and the support for the experts' testimony in medical records and/or literature , not to mask persona l preference with expert witness credibilit y deter minations. Andreu v. Sec'y of HHS , 569 F. 3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\"A specia l master [cannot] cloak the application of an erroneous legal standar d in the guise of a credibilit y deter mination, and there by shield it from appellate revie w. A trial court makes a credibilit y deter mination in order to assess the candor of a fact witness, not to evaluate whether an expert witness' medic al theory is supported by the ical Merre ll Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993) (An expert witness' theory is scientifica lly valid when it supports the conclusion that \"it purports to -42-show.\"); Garcia v. Sec'y of HHS 05-0720V, 2008 5068934 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Nov. 12, 2008) (\"the question of whether an expert's theory possesses scientific bona fides goes to the persua siveness of the evidenc e on the question and \"Weighing the persua siveness of particula r evidenc e often require s a finder of fact to assess the reliability of testimony , including expert testimony , and we have made clear that the specia l masters have that responsibility in Vaccine Act cases.... [To say that] the specia l master may not 'cloa k the application of an erroneous legal standard in the guise of a credibilit y deter mination, and there by shield it from appellate revie w\" ... is not to say , howeve r, that a spe cial master , as the finder of fact in a Vaccine Act case, is prohibited from making credibility determinations regarding expert testimony .\" Moberly v. Sec 'y S, __ F.3d __ 2010 WL 118661, *8 (F ed. Cir. 2010). There fore, the Court's task now is to analy ze the differ ences betwee n the opinions offered to deter mine whether Petitioner has established a logic al sequence of cause and effect, having occur red in a medically appropr iate time frame, which is biologica lly plausible to tie together the factual sequenc e and explain Petitioner's injury . See Althen v. Sec'y of HHS 1274, 2005); 451 F. 3d 1352, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2006), rehearing and rehearing en banc denied , (Oct. 24, 2006), cert. den., 168 L. Ed. 2d 242, 75 U.S.L .W. 3644 (2007); Walther v. Sec'y of HHS , 485 F. 3d 1146 (Fed. Cir. 2007); de Bazan Sec'y of HHS , 539 F. 3d 1347, 1352 (F ed. Cir. 2008). Worthy of first mention is the fact that Evely n's treating physicians did not settle on any acute aetiolog y for the onset of her seizures. Although Petitioners argued that her treaters implicated g astrointestinal illness, the medical records did not indicate any immediate cause for Evely n's condit ion. Likewise, despite the presumption that ever y doctor in this case communicated r egarding a genetic predisposition, none was specific ally identified. Granted, the full panoply of genetic mutation tests available at the prese nt was only partially available in 2004. These consid erations are noteworthy because of the probative weig ht afforded to treating doctors' diagnoses and aetiolog ical conclusions under the law in the Vaccine Prog ram. The absenc e of definitive concl usions leave s the Court to deter mine aetiolog y from the interpre tation provided by medical expert testimony and supporting medical literature proff ered by the par ties. From these sources, the Court dra ws the following conclusions: Pertussis tox in is one of a plurality of components in both the whole-cell and acellular pertussis vaccines. In the whole-c ell version, it is one of a larger number of components, and vaccines vary rathe r widely in exact ratios and composit ion at the consumer l evel. In contra st, acellular pertussis vac cine ha s only a handf ul of components, which include pertussis toxin that has generally been partially altere d and disabled in some way. From the medical literature , the Court derive s the conclusion that the greater proportion of acellular pertussis vaccines are chemica lly toxoided, which damag es certain epitopes on the toxin itself to detoxi fy the toxin. Some lesser proportion are crafted from genetica lly-alter ed pertussis toxin, which disable the toxin's capacity for damag e while keeping the aspec ts neede d for immunogenic ity (i.e., summoning an immune response in the subject) with greater precision, consistency , perma nence , and simpli city of proce ss. Detoxify ing the pertussis toxin into a non-tox ic form (a toxoid) consists of either chemica lly crippling or genetica lly deleting some part of the two- branc h toxin, such that the B branc h cannot attach the toxin to vulnera ble cell structure s and/or such -43-that the A branc h cannot be transloca ted across the cell membrane, and/or such t hat the A branc h cannot damag e the cell. A nt l detoxi enoug h of the toxin's epitopes to rende r it safe while allowing enoug h to remain for the immune sy stem to \"learn\" the toxin's contours in order to form matching antibodies. There also seems to be a conce rn that chemica lly detoxi the to \"re vert\" back into a toxic form. Petitioners' theory rests on the proposition that one of the bases of those conc erns c ame to fruition in Evely n's case, and that her stipulated genetic predisposition made her more sensitive than an average vaccinee. That is, Petitioners' theory , as proposed by Dr. Kinsbourne, is that Evelyn received a DTaP dose with pertussis toxin that had intact capability to cause neurolog ic damag e, either as a result of incomplete toxoiding or toxic reversion, and that the toxoid succeeded in destabilizi ng the inhibitory action of certain neurona l cells, causing greater neurona l excitabilit y, which led to a seizure in Evely n. The fact, to which Dr. Kinsbourne stipulated, that she was genetica lly predisposed to seizures only serve d to lower the threshold of neurona l excitabilit y necessary to initi ate a seizure. Dr. Wiznitzer opined that this theory was inhere ntly implausible as a reasonable theore tical explanation of potential vaccine injury mecha nism. His disputation focuse d on the efficacy and reliability of industry standards in the chemica l toxoiding proce ss, and the high level of product testing and extra safety measure s to prevent a vaccine dose containing functional pertussis toxin from reaching the consumer. He noted that, for the pertussis toxin to inflict the harm of which it is able in its pre-toxoided form, it must retain functionality in both the A and B portions of the toxin: If the A branc h were damag ed, as the primary agent of harm, it could not affect the G proteins and upset the neurona l equilibrium; if the B branc h were disabled, the toxin could not bind to vulnera ble cells and the A branc h, even if functio nal, could not inflict its damag e. In his estimation, it would be nearly impossibl e for the industrial proce ss of chemical t oxoiding to allow s uch an intact fo rm of pertussis tox in to make its way into a consumer dose of ac ellular pe rtussis vaccine . Moreove r, Dr. Wiznitzer pointed out that genetica lly modifie d pertussis toxin would not suffe r from either conce rn inhere nt to the l toxoiding proce with which Petitioners' expert seeme d to agree. Nonethele ss, from the record before the Court in this matter, i t appea rs that, for the relevant period herein, ss for acellular pertussis. That being the case, the Court is left to presume that the dose received by Evely n was, more likely than not, a chemically toxoided vaccine. There fore, reference to the safety capability of those vaccines manufa cture d by genetic modification do not rende r Petitioner's theory implausible. In actua lity, the Court finds, based on a thoroug h revie w of the evidence prese nted in this matter, especially the medical literature filed herein, that Petitioners' theory is not incre dible. Whether i t is sufficie ntly plausible to surmount a prepondera nce is another matter, but it is not so farfetched to extend beyond the pale of the medically plausible. Indeed, pertussis toxin is the common denominator betwee n whole-c ell and acellular pertussis vaccines, and excluding it entirely would seem to preclude immunit y to wild pertussis. Even if the threa t of toxicity is all but obliterated by modern toxoiding proce sses, the statistically slim chanc e rema ins that a toxoid retains or regains sufficie nt toxicity to affect a genetica lly sensitive subject. And, as the medical literature -44-seems to reiter ate, the threa t of serious adver se reactions previously associate d with whole-c ell pertussis did not disappea r with the introduction of toxoiding pertussis toxin, but continues to be a conce rn, one that is reflected in the medical literature filed in this matter. Even if the theory proff ered by Petitioners is incorre ct, there association betwee n acellular pertussis and adver se events such as complex seizures that is statistically relevant beyond the natura lly-occurring seizure eve nts of a g eneral control population. It may be, howeve r, that there is some other factor at work besides the pertussis toxin direc tly affecting neurons that explains such an association. Dr. Wiznitzer argued as much, even proff ering one such mecha nism: that the acellular pertussis vaccine may cause a fever which otherwise would not have develope d at that time, that the stress of a heightened tempera ture on the brain could aggravate a seizure, and that the seizure threshold tempera ture might be lower for a genetica lly (or otherwise) susceptible subject than it would be for someone without such predisposition. As noted supra , Dr. Kinsbourne stipulated that Evely n has a genetic predisposition to seizure reactivity , which makes he r more vulne rable than other c hildren similarly situated who re ceive the vac cine. In fact, it seems unnece ssary for the Court to rule on the scientific reliability of Dr. Kinsbourne' s latent pertussis toxicity in DTaP theory , inasmuch as both experts stipulate to a certain set of medical facts: I. That the body 's reaction to the immunogenic nature of the DTaP vaccine can often include fever; II. That Evely n did exhibi t a fever, the onset of which followed within less than 24 hours of va ccina tion and prec eded the onset of the f irst seizure within severa l minutes to a f ew hours; III. That fevers impose stress upon the body 's metabolism, espec ially that of the brain, which can provoke seizures, known as febrile seizures, meaning customarily that the fever tempera ture must meet or exceed 102EF; IV. That most commonly , such febri le seizures are short, simple, benig n, and limit ed in number and duration; V. That, occasionally howeve r, a seizure provoked by a fever, when combined with a latent predisposition, such a seizure may be sever e, complex, prolong ed, and perha ps even initiate a chronic conditio n; VI. That persons with a genetic susceptibility or other predis position may have a seizure provoked with a less sever e fever than would otherwise be necessary -even as low as 100EF; and VII. That what triggers the seizures to manifest whe n it does in the onset seizure is the feve r.27 The ex perts diverg e on an epistemologica l point that has often plagued the analy sis of but for causa tion: Had Evely n's seizures not manifested in biologic connec tion and temporal association with her fever, would they have manifested regardle ss, either at the same moment, or very soon there after? The but for proposition is, linguistically , a past contra ry to fact construction: it attempts to divine what would have been the case had events not transpire d as they have; it seeks facts about an alterna te reality for which we have no data. In some cases, the question might be easie r to answe r, These findings are similar to those made by the Court in deciding the cases of Simon v. Sec'y of HHS, No.27 05-0941V, 2007 WL 1772062 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. 2007) (awarding compensation where both parties' \"experts agree[d] vaccines, including the DTaP vaccine can fevers can trigger seizures ... [and] \"that [the] initial seizure is connected to [the] subsequent seizures, [] epilepsy and death\"); and Cusati v. Sec'y of HHS, No. 05-5049V, 2005 WL 4983872 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Mar. 9, 2006) (where the parties' experts both agreed that vaccination \"was a logical source of [] fever associated with [] initial complex febrile seizure\" which was related to a \"subsequent intractable seizure disorder,\" the injury complained of). -45-but otherwise, as here, it may turn problematic, because what is soug ht is a hypothetical outcome contra ry to the facts as they actua lly transpire d. Dr. Kinsbourne opined that the seizures may not have occur red for years, or ever, in the absenc e of that neurolog ic stress prese nted by that moment. Dr. Wiznitzer strong ly believed that, had Evely n's onset of seizures not manifested when they did, they surely would have within a matter of a few months. Howeve r, the Court takes notice that manifestation of genetic traits often defie s specific predic tion and is depende nt on environmenta l factors. One need look no further than to the doctrine within genetics of phenoty pic plasticity ,28 which explains how wide varia tions in gene expression are the consequence of divergent external factors in an organism's environ ment. Indeed, adher ing to a strict deter minism of genetic29 expression, or biologic deter minism generally, as modern permutations of and Democr itus' theory of atomic deter minism , dispelled most definitively in the last centur y by quantum indeterminac y (subatomic chaos) . Howeve r, for better or for worse, the common law and30 the Vaccine Act itself do not adher e to such a deter minist ic view of reality. See infra . Granted, there may be some genes that will express with a greater probability -approa ching certainty -at a particula r moment in time, but many others do not possess that \"egg-timer\" quality to express at an exact moment, or they may express signific antly later, continge nt upon environmenta l factors to trigger them. Even Dr. Wiznitzer's own opinion betra ys this point. Dr. Wiznitzer did not contend that Evely n's onset seizure would have occur red of genetic necessity on the morning of 12 Februar y 2004, regardle ss of the slight fever or any thing e lse. The f act that he r first seizure did occur when it did, and did not occur a few months later, is something he agreed was influence d by events transpiring at that time: i.e., the fever. Indeed, he was quite clear that the fever very well may have \"triggered\" or \"unmaske d\" the seizure disorder. This does not detra ct from the fact that she did possess a genetic predisposition to seizure vulnera bility , a fact stipulated by both parties' experts on numerous occasions. In fact, Dr. Kinsbourne conce ded that she would not have had the seizures without the presenc e of suc h a pre dispositi on. On a smaller, but related point, Dr. Wiznitzer was equivoca l as to what cause d the raised tempera ture in Evely n on the morning of y 2004: w hether the DTaP vac cination of less than 24 hours preceding , or an unidentified gastrointestinal illness that the medical records state had run its course and resolved by the time of the vaccination. It rathe r strains logic to set in equipoise with a very recent vaccination ( one which Dr. Wiznitzer agreed is know n to be ca pable of causing fever) a condition that was not febrile in its apog ee, and which Evely n's primary care physician believed had resolved. See Pet. Ex. 4 at 12. It appe ars far more likely to the Court that Evely n's aggravated tempera ture on the morning of 12 Februar y 2004 (along with her aggravated demea nor See quotations from medical literature, supra at 33-34 and note 19.28 This seems a necessary predicate for certain theories of evolutionary biology, as a corollary to speciation by29 natural selection due to naturally occurring genetic variations in populations. See, e.g., Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation, or, for that matter, his cat. The Court notes that some Intelligence30 may comprehend every subatomic collision vector or wave pattern, and that an argument could still be made for an almost infinitely complex determinism in the universe. However, fundamental indeterminism remains the limitation of mortal knowledge. -46-and symptoms the night befor e) were the direc t result of her immune response to the DTaP vaccine. From this conca tenation, the Court arrives at the following findings, in addition and continuation to those noted supra : VIII. That Evely n's DTaP vaccine cause d, throug h her immune response there to, a heig htened tempe rature , even if only a slight fever ; IX. That Evely n possessed a genetic predisposition to seizures, as agreed to by both parties' experts (even if such predisposition could not be localized to a single gene or otherwise identified specific ally by her treating physicians); X. That there fore both the genetic predisposition and the vaccination were causa l factors in bring ing about Evely n's injury . In short, the Court finds that Evely n's injury would not have occurre d but for her genetic predisposition, but that the injury 's onset would not have occur red when it did but for the vaccination-induced fever that immediately preceded it and which trigg ered the ons et of Evely n's seizures. III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW As aforementioned, the Court is authoriz ed to award compensa tion for claims wher e the medical records or medical opinion have demo nstrated by preponde rant evidenc e that either a cognizable Table Injury occur red within the presc ribed period or that an injury was actua lly cause d by the vaccination in question. \u00a7 13(a) (1). If Petitioners had claimed that Evely n had suffe red a \"Table\" injury , to them would \u00a713(a) (1)(A) have assig ned the burden of provin g such by a preponde rance of the evidenc e. In this case, howeve r, Petitioners do not claim a presumption of causa tion affor ded by the Vac cine I njury Table, and thus the P etition may preva il only if it can be demonstrated to a prepondera nt standard of evidenc e that the va ccina tion in question, more li kely than not, a ctually cause d the injury alleg ed. See \u00a7 11(c) (1)(C)(ii)(I ) & F. 2d 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1992); Strother v. Sec'y , 950 F. 2d 731 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The Federal Circuit has indicated that, to preva il, every petitioner must: show a medical theory causa lly connec ting the vaccination and the injury . Causation in fact require s proof of a logic al sequenc e of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury . A reputa ble medical or scientific explanation must support this logica l sequenc e of c ause a nd eff ect. Grant , 956 F. 2d a t 1148 (citations omitted); see also Strother , 21 Cl. Ct . at 370. Furthermore , an to show by preponde rant evidenc e that the vaccination broug ht about [the] injury by providing : (1) a medical theory causa lly connec ting the vaccination and the injury ; (2) a logic al sequenc e of cause and effect showing that the -47-vaccination was the reason for the injury ; and (3) a showing of a proxi mate temporal relationship between va ccina tion and injury . Althen v. Se , 418 F. 3d 1274, 1278 ( Fed. Cir. 2005). As part of that analy sis, the Fede ral Circuit re cently explained: [T]he proxi mate temporal relationship prong require s preponde rant proof that the onset of symptoms occur red within a timeframe for which, given the medical understa nding of the disorder' s aetiolog y, it is medically acceptable to infer causa tion-in-fac t. de Bazan v. Se 539 F. 3d 1347, 1352 ( Fed. Cir. 2008). Under this analy sis, while a petitioner is not require d to propose or pr ove def initively that a specific biologica l mecha nism can and did cause the injury , he must still proff er a plausible medical theor y that causa lly connec ts the vaccine with the injury alleg ed. See Knudsen v. Sec 'y of HHS , 35 F. 3d 543, 549 ( 1994). As a matter of elucidation, the Under signe d takes note of the following two-par t test, which has been vindicated and viewed with approva l by the Federal Circuit, and which guides the Court's31 practical appr oach to a nalyzing the Althen elements: The Undersig ned has often bifurcate d the issue of actua l causation into the \"can it\" prong and the \"did it\" prong : (1) whether there is a scientifically plausible theory which ex plains that such i njury could foll ow di rectly from vaccination; and (2) whether that theory 's proce ss was at work in the instant case, based on the factual evidentiar y record extant.

Sec'y of HHS. , 485 F.3d 1146, 1151 analy sis in off-Table cases, the Restatement (Second) of Torts applies and 'the petitioner is tre ated as the equivalent of the tort plaintiff'). In the water shed case of Shyface v. Sec'y of HHS , 165 F. 3d at 1352, the Federal Circuit \"adopt[ed] the Restatement [(2d) of Torts] rule for purposes of deter mining vaccine injury , that an action is the 'legal cause ' of harm if that action is a 'substantial factor' in bring ing about the harm, and that the harm would not have occur red but for the action,\" and that rule continues to guide the Court today in the instant matter. Cf. Hargrove v. Sec'y of HHS , of the conce pt of causa tion in tort law is essential to resolution of this matter. In this case, the centr al, essential facts are almost all undisputed. What is necessary is to induce what result is called for under the law when viewing these facts in relief , against the immarce scible bac kdrop of the c ommon law. 33 The mandate of the Federal Circuit in Shyface to follow the RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS on the application32 of actual causation did not indicate how this Court should approach the tectonic shift of the common law into the later Restatement(s). The short answer to this question is that the Federal Circuit incorporated the RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS, and until the Circuit does otherwise to change that gloss, that is the mandatory precedent binding on this Court. By way of more detailed analysis, given the Circuit's reasoning in Shyface for incorporating the Restatement, i.e. that Congress contemplated the common law (in its then contemporaneous understanding) within the Vaccine Act draftsmanship, thus presuming the common law as a background legislative intent, it would appear that only the Second Restatement is binding on this Court in matters touching on actual causation, because that is the version in use at the time of the Act's drafting and passage. Likewise, when the Federal Circuit decided Shyface in 1999, the RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY had already become available in published form, and yet the Circuit did not choose to incorporate or even reference that Restatement's provisions at all, notwithstanding the potential corollary to the Program's focus on causation in the absence of a fault element. Had it done so, a contrary argument could have been made that the Circuit's reading of congressional intent was a progressing correspondence to whatever Restatement provisions were most current. However, this would seem to correspond to the more dubious \"statutory purpose\" canon of interpretation. The Court's reading of Shyface leads to a result that the Third Restatement should be viewed at most as persuasive, but not mandatory authority, and is not to be followed where it conflicts with the Second Restatement. Therefore, to the extent the Court cites to the Third Restatement herein, it shall be only to bolster or elaborate citations to other sources. For the sake of brevity, rather than discuss myriad common law case opinions, the Court will reference W.33 Page Keeton, PROSSER & KEETON ON TORTS (5th ed.1984) (hereinafter \"Keeton at __\") and leave the reader to pursue further inquiries to the cases cited therein. Mr. Prosser was a strong and respected force in the crafting of the Second Restatement, and served as Reporter thereto for some time. -49-Regarding the epistemolog ical quandar y raised supra , the Court notes the position taken by the common law, one that contemplates the radic al alterna tives of human choice and unpredic table events. If it is deter minist ic at all, it is in an absolute sense, wher ein the causa l factors deter mining eventua l outcomes are overw helming complex, so as to overw helm, elude and confound human knowledg e. \"In a philosophical sense, the conseque nces of an act go forwa rd to eternity, and the cause s of an event go back to the dawn of human events, and beyond.\" Keeton at 264. This is the34 basis for what is termed \"cause in fact,\" which is based upon a \"but for\" formulation. Keeton at 265 (\"[T]he classic test for deter mining cause in fact direc ts the factfinder to compar e what did occur with what would have occur red if hypothetical, contra ry-to-fa ct conditions ha d exis ted ... the ter m \"cause in fac t\" embra ces a ll things which ha ve so fa r contributed to the result that without them it would not have occur red.\" ) (some internal marks omitted). To rephr ase slightly for this context the concise statement of the rule, a vaccine \"is a cause of the [injury ] if the [injury ] would not have occur red but for that [vaccine]; conver sely, the [vaccine] is not a cause of the [injury ] if the [injury ] would have occur red without it.\" Keeton at 266. Of interest in this case, \"The conception of causa tion in fact extends not only to positive acts and active physical forces, but also to pre-existing passive conditions which have played a materia l part in bring ing about the event.\" Keeton at 265. This open-e nded universe of infinite chains of cause and effect must be trunca ted for human compre hension in order to attach legal responsibility , howeve r. Finitude demands an outer limit , a line to be draw n to divide what is a cause attaching liability -a legally proxi mate cause -from that which averts such responsibility . \"As a practical matter, legal responsibility must be limit ed to those cause s which are so closely connec ted with the result and of such signific ance that the law is justified in imposing liability .\" Keeton at 264. This is due to the understanding that, \"The event without milli ons of cause s is simply inconce ivable; and the mere fact of causa tion, as distinguished from the nature and degree of the causa l connection, can provide no clue of any kind to singling out those which are to be held legally responsible.\" Keeton at 266. Based on this conce ptual understanding , there fore, it is certainly legal error to require the thing, act, or proce ss at issue (here the vaccine) to be identified as the \"sole cause ,\" the \"dominant cause ,\" or the \"proximate cause \" of the harm complained of. Keeton at 266. The correct formulation for deter mining proxi mate cause , then, is35 Outside of the law, this precept is referred to as \"sensitive dependence on initial conditions\" or, more34 colloquially, \"the butterfly effect.\" It was identified by Henri Poincar\u00e9 in the nineteenth century and elucidated by Edward Lorenz, a pioneer of chaos theory mathematics. However, it is grounded in Newtonian mathematics within the concept of the \"evolution rule of the dynamical system\" (\u00d4).t Prosser and Keeton go on to describe a circumstance where the but-for causation test fails but where liability35 is imposed even still, based upon the \"substantial factor\" test: If two causes concur to bring about an event, and either one of them, operating alone, would have been sufficient to cause the identical result, some other test is needed.... [E.g.,] The defendant sets a fire, which merges with a fire from some other source; the combined fires burn the plaintiff's property, but either one would have done it alone. In such cases, it is quite clear that each cause has in fact played so important a part in producing the result that responsibility should be imposed upon it... Keeton at 266-67. -50-to ask if something is a substantial factor. Of centr al importance in this case, if something is a36 substantial factor in causing the injury alleg ed, causat ion and liability are not avoided \"mer ely because other causes have contributed to the result, since such cause s, innumerable , are alway s prese nt.\" Kee ton at 268. For the Court here to award compensa tion and hold that the vaccine \"actually cause d\" Evely n's injury , \"it is only necessary that it be a legal cause of the harm. It is not necessary that it be the cause , using the word 'the' as meaning the sole and even the predominant cause.\" RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS \u00a7 430, Comm ent d (empha ses added) ; cf. RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM \u00a7 26, comment c (\"tortious conduct need only be a factual cause of the other' s harm.\" ) (emphasis in original). Furthermore , if the sequela e of the vaccination at issue did \"actively and continuousl y opera te to bring about\" Evely n's injury , vaccine causa tion is not even wher e \"the active and substantially simult aneous opera tion of the effects [of her genetic susceptibility ] is also a substantial factor in bring ing about the harm.\" Id. at \u00a7 439. The modern trend in common law cases, embedde d in the rationale of the Restatement, is to ask why legal cause should be avoided wher e the complained- of cause coexists along side other cause s. Kee ton at 301. As explained supra at the Court's finding s of fact, Evely n's injury -seizures which began following an unbroken chain of events, beginning with the DTaP vaccination-would not have occur red but for her vaccination on 11 Februar y 2004. The first seizure s et the course for all that followed: As both experts explained, the first seizures of that morning are indivisi ble and insepara ble from all that followed, to form Evely n's seizure disorder. Likewise, Evely n's genetic predisposition is a but for cause of Evely n's seizures. As Dr. Kinsbourne conce ded, most other children in Evely n's position would not have suffe red a seizure in response to her vaccination or the slight fever. Dr. Wiznitzer agreed that persons with a predisposition require a lesser threshold to initiate seizure activity . Based on the foregoing, both the vaccination and Evely n's genetic predisposition each constitute a cause in fact of her injury , because the injury would not have occur red as it did but for each of these. The rema ining question-the ultimate issue prese nted in this case-is whether the vaccination should be adjudg ed a substantial cause , or whether genetic predisposition constitutes a superse ding c ause unde r the law . Respondent proff ered evidenc e and arguments that Evely n's genetic predisposition was a superse ding cause of her injury , rende ring irrele vant the vacci ne as a substantial cause . On this point, the Restatement indicates that, if the administration of the vacci ne(s) to Evely n \"creates or incre t \"The 'substantial factor' formulation is one concerning legal significance rather than factual quantum.\" 36 Keeton at 267. See also RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS \u00a7 430, Comment a (\"The word \"substantial\" is used to denote the fact that the defendant's conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause, using that word in the popular sense, in which there always lurks the idea of responsibility, rather than in the so-called \"philosophic sense,\" which includes every one of the great number of events without which any happening would not have occurred.\"). -51-(as \"a force of nature \"), and the vaccine is found to be a substantial factor in causing her injury , then the genetic predisposition c annot constitute OF \u00a7 and Comment a unto. Likewise, \"Where the [vaccine] creates or incre ases the risk of a particular harm and is a subst antial factor in causing that harm, the fact that the harm is broug ht about throug h the intervention of another force [e.g., genetic predisposition] does not relieve [Respondent] of liability , except wher e the harm is ... not within the scope of the risk created by the [vaccine].\" RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS \u00a7 442B. positive, a causa tive factor37 unrela ted to the vaccine may only be accounted as superse ding (i.e., negating the vaccine's causa tive impact) wher e its opera tion is \"extraordinary \" and wher e the resulting harm there from is qualitatively distinct from the risk posed by the vac cine. R ESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS \u00a7 451. Apply ing the general rule from the common law of torts, compensa tion is appropr iate even when the vaccine \"oper upon a conce aled physical condition, such as ... a latent disease, or susceptibility to disease, to produce conseque nces\" incapa ble of reasonable anticipation. Keeton at 291. Additionally , wher e the vaccine combines with a preexisting condition (such as genetic predisposition), the extent of the ultimate se quela need not have been foreseeable. Keeton at 292. As every aspiring attorney learns, \"a defendant takes a plaintiff as he finds him,\" a rule most familiarly illust rated in the \"eggshell skull\" case of 461 (\"The negligent actor is subject to liability for harm to another althoug h a physical condition of the other which is neither known nor should be known to the actor makes the injury greater than that which the actor as a reasonable man should have foreseen as a probable result of his conduct.\" ). Cf. RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM \u00a7 31 (\"When an actor 's tortious conduct causes harm to a per son that, beca use of a preexisting physical or mental condition or other characteristics of the person, is of a greater magnitude or differ ent type than might reasonably be expected, the actor is neverthe less subject to liability for a ll such harm to the per son.\"). On this same general theme, the conce pt of foreseeability may also enter a discussion of legal cause . If fever or a seizure are possible risks a specia lly-vulnera ble vaccinee might sustain, the common law incorpora ted into the Restatement would milit ate for a finding of legal at \u00a7 442B. Additionally , intervening forces are within the scope of the\" risk created by the vaccine, and there fore also of Respondent's liability ; \"interve ning cause s which fall fairly in this category will not supersede\" the substantiality of the vaccine as a cause. Keeton at 303-304; see also Id . at note 18. See also Comment b to that section:37 If the [vaccine] has created or increased the risk that a particular harm to the [petitioner] will occur, and has been a substantial factor in causing that harm, it is immaterial to the [Respondent's] liability that the harm is brought about in a manner which no one ... could possibly have been expected to foresee or anticipate. This is true not only where the result is produced by the direct operation of the [vaccine] upon conditions or circumstances existing at the time [e.g., genetic predisposition], but also where it is brought about through the intervention of other forces which the actor could not have expected, whether they be forces of nature, or the actions of animals... This is to say that any harm which is in itself foreseeable, as to which the [vaccine] has created or increased the recognizable risk, is always \"proximate,\" no matter how it is brought about... -52-Respondent's argument conce rning genetic predisp osition as a superse ding cause cente rs around an argument that the injury would have occur red sooner or later notwithstanding the vaccine: that it was overw helmingly the genetic factor that cause d the injury , and the vaccine only deter mined when such injury occur red. Howeve r, apply ing the same logic , one could argue in any case wher e the injury complained of is death, that death would have occur red eventua lly, even if it only occur red when it did because of the conduct or occ urrence c omplained of. De ath is certainly inevitable for mortal Man. It is one of the events all can agree is biologica lly fated or destined: its details are only38 a question of timing and circumstances. Howeve r, such an argument, when raised, has been roundly rejected by the common law. Keeton at 272. Cf. RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM \u00a7 26, comment b (\"An act can also be a factual cause in accelerating an outcome that otherwise would have occur red at a later time. ... Acceleration may occur for ha rms other than de ath as we ll.\") Perhaps considering the facts of this case in a context more familiar to common law tort cases would be helpful. Respondent's argument for the genetic factor as a superse ding cause could be analog ized as saying, in effect, that a defendant's negligence with a fire source did not cause a forest fire; it was cause d rathe r by an espec ially dry summer, persistent heavy winds, or the over- accumulation of plant debris and overg rowth. In a differe nt environment, defenda nt's fire source would never have wroug ht the damag e sustained, and there was nothing espec ially dang erous or otherwise ext raordinary inhere nt or integral to the fire source . The fire was inevit able: regardle ss of the spark, something else would surely have triggered the danger ous conditions wher eby fire blazed to such ruin, even if perha ps somewhat later (or earlier), e.g., a lightning strike. The defendant's spark was merely a trigger which did not cause all the harm sustained, and at most should be limit ed as a cause to only its very limit ed immediate effects. The common law, howeve r, has rejected this logic for the most part. See Keeton at 292, notes 1 and 2. Given the foregoing exemplar, the common law has invariably held a defendant liable, and has most regularly held defendant responsible for all the fire's effects which follow. See, e.g., Burlington & M.R.R. Co. v . Westover, 4 Neb. 268 (1876); see also Keeton at 294, note 15 and surrounding text; cf James 3:5 (\"Behold, how g reat a matter a little fire ki ndleth!\") . There fore, Respondent \"may be expected to take e xisting circ umstances a s they are, and be responsible for the effect of the [vaccination] upon them.\" Ke eton at 294. Apply ing the Federal Circ uit's de cision in Shyface and, by incorpora tion, the common law as summated in the Restatement, it seems altog ether clear, that a genetic predisposition, exerting an independe nt influence while acting in conjunction wit h a vaccine rea ction, cannot be accounted a superse ding c ause ove rwhe lming the substantiality of the va ccine as a c ause. It may strike the casua l observe r that the Court is here confla ting Petitioners' burden to prove the vaccine to be a substantial cause with Respondent's burden (see Walther , supra ; cf. Pafford , See Hebrews 9:27 (\"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment\"); Ecclesiastes38 3:20 (\"All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again\"); Isaiah 40:6-8 (\"All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.\"). -53-supra ) to prove that a factor unrela the superseding cause (see Hargrove , supra ). As de Bazan , supra , this is not in ac tual causa tion cases within the Prog ram. In fact, in the experience of the Under signe d, it is typically unavoidable. Dividing Respondent's task (i.e., proving that a factor unrela ted was the actua l cause ) from Petitioner's case in chief is only logic al or coher ent in Table cases, wher e vaccine causa tion is presumed, and there fore the question of actua l causation has not be en already raised. Bifur cating into two modes or phases in an actua l causa tion case defie s logic and practicality . At common law, affirmative defenses used by the party against whom the claim is broug ht invariably proff er some new set of facts, w ith distinct elements, after the claimant party has offered the facts to prove the elements of his cause of action. A construct in which an a ffirma tive defense contains all the same elements as the cause of action's main component, addresses the same question-indeed, the very same transac tion or occur rence, and wher e the Court's finding s of fact and conclusions of law on the case in chief often work issue preclusion on the affirmat ive defense-in short, a situation like this one-amounts to a vox nihili in the conte xt of the common law. The Federal Circuit in Walther rema rked that a party can hardly be held to prove a negative, and yet bifurca ting factor unrela ted analy sis from the petitioner's case in chief , wher e the Court has found that the vaccine did actua lly cause the injury complained of, would require Respondent to disprove what the Court has just found to be true! Inevitably , the fa ctor unre lated issue will be dec ided during the case in chief. It would be an odd case indeed were the Court to find that the vaccine did actually cause the injury complained of, but then ruled that a factor unrela ted was the actua l cause of the injury complained of. Perhaps this point may be deeme d too esoteric by some, but they need only look at the last five years of Fe deral Circuit opinions discussing a ctual ca usation to see that it is not an idle query . In sum, the Court conclude s as a matter of law that, weig hing Evely n's DTaP vaccination of 11 Fe bruar y as a c ausal factor, it wa s a substantial f actor in bring ing a bout her injury , and wa s not superseded by her genetic predisposition, which was also a substantial factor. Henc e, the Court RULES that Petitioners are entitled to compensation, to be de termined by further proce eding s. IV. CONCLUSION There fore, in light of the foregoing, the Court RULES in favor of entitlement in this matter. The parties are instructed to contac t the Court for further proce eding s, regarding the issue of damag es. The Court ma y be reached via my law clerk, Isaiah Kalinowski, Esq., at 202-357-6351. IT IS SO ORDERED. "}
