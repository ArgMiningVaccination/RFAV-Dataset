Most people use this phrase to describe the three parts of human health that shape and balance the whole. Mind is pretty clear; and so is body; but what exactly do we mean when we include spirit as a part of the trifecta of human health? The term \"spirit\" is a bit more ambiguous than \"mind\" and \"body.\" It's intangible, it's energetic, and it can mean different things to different people. Plus, when it comes to Western views on health, it's only recently that we've started including mental and emotional health in the bigger picture of physical health. Spiritual health, or the role of spirit, is certainly on the cutting-edge of how we understand whole body health. By contrast, Eastern medicine includes spirit or, roughly translated, \"Shen\" in ancient Chinese medical texts that date back 3,000 years or more. This notion of \"spirit\" is understood to play as much of a role in overall health as our mental, physical, and emotional components. In fact, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has such an advanced understanding of these energetic levels of health, that it has 3 different terms for the 3 \"treasures\" of human life-- Shen, is just one of them. In this article, we take a deeper look at the concept of spirit or Shen in Chinese medicine. We look at its origins, and how it is seen, measured and supported through Chinese medicine. Through advancing our understanding of the concept of spirit in Chinese medicine, we can deepen our understanding of this elusive energy in order to harness and integrate it into our understanding of overall health. While Western medicine is particularly adept at acute care like resetting broken bones, Eastern medicine is particularly attuned for preventative care, as well as relief from chronic health issues like inflammation and anxiety. Why? Well, it could be because Eastern medicine has such a rich understanding of something that is lacking in Western medicine - an acknowledgement of the intangible, energetic aspects of health - including mental and emotional states, and the concept of spirit. Finally, Shen, is roughly translated as the \"spirit\" or \"presence\" of a person. In TCM, Shen is recognised as \"a look behind the eyes,\" or the presence of \"light in the eyes.\" It is associated with consciousness, and the capacity of the mind to form ideas and the desire to live life. Do you ever notice a person's energy when they walk into a room? Often, when people are sick, and/or grieving, their energy can be very low. Their heads might be hanging low, shoulders caved in, they may avoid eye contact, and speak softly, if at all. Their skin, hair, and eyes might be dull, and in some rooms, they might barely be noticed. They might have trouble making decisions, or taking action in life. By contrast, imagine someone walking into a room with radiant energy-- a big smile, a willingness to engage, and a head held high. When asked a question, they might look at you directly in the eyes, which are bright and expressive. They have the capacity to think about things before making a swift decision on the best way forward. Can you picture the difference between the two? When someone is sleeping, you can look at them and tell there's still a person inhabiting the body. There's a presence. But most doctors will tell you it's different when a person is in a coma (even if they can't tell you exactly why). The body is there, but there's a strange, almost physical sensation that the person is missing. That their essence, inexplicably, is somewhere else. The difference between the two states, roughly translated, can help reveal the meaning of Shen in Chinese medicine. For most Westerners, the concept of spirit or Shen is quite new. For years, many of us have exclusively associated the word \"spirit\" with a particular belief system, or organised religion. In the East, however, spirit transcends belief and just is-- it is recognised to be as real and essential to overall health as our blood, bones, organs and nervous system. In the West, many of us suffer from alarming rates of chronic conditions related to the \"heart-mind,\" such as depression, anxiety, mood swings, insomnia, and other mental and emotional health disorders. While Western medicine is poised to treat some of these symptoms, many people are left without the appropriate resources to actually heal from them. By integrating Eastern medicine philosophies that have a richer understanding of the elusive realms of mental, emotional, and spiritual health, we may be able to begin naming, diagnosing, and treating these disorders in holistic ways that increase our chances of true healing. Several research studies have shown that acupuncture can reduce symptoms in patients with minor depression, chronic anxiety disorders, and general anxiety disorders. Using contemplative practices such as meditation, prayer, drawing, journal writing, or spending time in nature will help strengthen the Shen. Shen can also be strengthened through qigong (energy work), physical activity, Chinese herbal remedies, and acupuncture. Chinese Medicine, as an adjunct to counseling and psychotherapy, can help patients reach tremendous healing at profound levels, by gently addressing the deepest level of existence - the spirit.
