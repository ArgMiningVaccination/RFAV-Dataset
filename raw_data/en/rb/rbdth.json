What's wrong with conventional air fresheners? Air fresheners emit a range of hazardous air pollutants. ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5093181/)) Even at low-level exposures, air fresheners are associated with a range of negative effects, such as ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5093181/%5C)): - migraine headaches - asthma attacks - breathing difficulties, shortness of breath - eye, nose, or throat irritation - coughing - dizziness - skin problems (rashes, red skin, hives, etc.) - gastrointestinal issues (nausea, bloating, cramping, diarrhea) The reaction severity depends on individual sensitivity. Studies have found that: - Most conventional home air fresheners contained phthalates. Phthalates, used to dissolve and carry fragrance, are linked to changes in hormone levels, poor semen quality, birth defects, and reproductive harm. ( [1](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/airfresheners.pdf)) - Some air fresheners release significant amounts of formaldehyde and benzene ( [1](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/airfresheners.pdf)), which are known carcinogens. ( [2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280945278_EPHECT_III_Health_risk_assessment_of_exposure_to_household_consumer_products)) Additionally, there are more chemicals you want to avoid. However, you can't find the ingredients on the packaging since air freshening products rarely include them. I searched online to find the ingredient list of a commercial air freshener ( [1](http://www.rbnainfo.com/product.php?productLineId=2927), [2](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/869-AIRWICKFreshmaticUltraSparklingCitrus/)). I found that many of the ingredients are of high concern carcinogens, mutagens, or reproductive toxicants. The worst part is that air fresheners often use vague terms like \"pure,\" \"all-natural,\" or \"green.\" These terms do not have legal or regulatory definitions, and usually - they mean nothing. Unfortunately, there are no regulations and tests on these products to ensure that they are safe for consumers. These are the main reasons why it is best to limit exposure to store-bought air fresheners. Ingredients for the DIY air freshener: Essential oils: They will give a pleasant smell while being all-natural. Additionally, they offer various health benefits, which is a great bonus. Any therapeutic grade, high quality you have may work perfectly fine. Some of the best essential oils for this DIY recipe are: [Ylang and aids headaches. ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16780969/)) [Rose essential oil](https://amzn.to/2SyPB3B): Improves mood and [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18041606/)) [ucalyptus](https://amzn.to/2SCvcLa)and [ginger bit of alcohol, such as vodka (at least 40%), will do a couple of things: - It will help the essential oils and water to mix more thoroughly. - It will allow the homemade air freshener to evaporate faster. - It will act as a preservative preventing the growth of microorganisms and bacteria. You could omit it if you like, but I think the end product is better with it. Witch hazel is an alternative that you can use. Witch hazel contains only a little alcohol, so it may not help the essential oils to mix well with the water. That's why make sure to give the bottle a good shake before each use. Baking soda: Baking soda is excellent at absorbing odor, and it can help neutralize bad smells. Adding too much baking soda will leave a residue, but it shouldn't be a problem if you only use a small amount. Where to buy plastic-free baking soda: [Arm & Hammer Baking Soda - box (link to Amazon)](https://amzn.to/3xqfDVI) [Zero Waste Bulk (the US)](https://www.zerowastebulk.com/products/baking-soda) [The Good Fill - bulk (the US)](https://thegoodfill.co/products/baking-soda-refill) [The Source Bulk Foods (the UK)](https://www.thesourcebulkfoods.co.uk/shop/cooking/bicarbonate-soda/) [Zero Waste Bulk Foods (the UK)](https://www.zerowastebulkfoods.co.uk/product-page/bicarbonate-of-soda) - Or local bulk & healthy food stores Filtered water: It is best to use distilled waste since it is free from any impurities removed, including minerals and microorganisms. Ultimately, you can use filtered water or boil tap water. Don't make the recipe if the water is still hot. You should wait for it to get cooler because the smell of the essential oils will evaporate. How to make air freshener with essential oils and baking soda Ingredients: - 1 \u00bd cup (350 ml) filtered water - 8-10 drops lavender essential oil - 8-10 drops cinnamon essential oil - 1 tbsp baking soda (15g) - 2 tbsp vodka (11 ml) - A reusable spray bottle Step 1: Add baking soda to a bowl, or a jar. Step 2: Add a bit of water, and mix well. You can add warm water, so the baking soda dissolves faster. Step 3: Add the vodka, then the essential oils (I used cinnamon and lavender). If you used warmer water (to dissolve the baking soda easier), wait for it to get cooler. Add the essential oils ony when the water is at room temperature. Step 4: Lastly - add the rest of the water & mix. Once everything is mixed, transfer to a spray bottle. If you have a funnel - use it! I didn't have one, so I had to improvise with a paper one (+spil a lot). 14 DIY air freshener scent combinations: Relaxation: - Cedarwood + rose - Tangerine + patchouli For sleep & calmness: - Cedarwood + lavender - Lavender + rose Refresh: - Lemon + tea tree - Lemon + peppermint + lavender - Lemon + rosemary - Cinnamon + tea tree + clove Clear mind: - Rosemary + peppermint - Lavender + bergamot Alertness: - Orange + peppermint Anti-anxiety: - Ylang-ylang + vetiver Energy - Rosemary + peppermint + lemon - Orange + lemon + grapefruit DIY Air Freshener With Essential Oils And Baking Soda Homemade, non-toxic air freshener. Ingredients - 1 \u00bd cup (350 ml) filtered water - 8-10 drops lavender essential oil - 8-10 drops cinnamon essential oil - 1 tbsp baking soda (15g) - 2 tbsp vodka (11 ml) - A reusable spray bottle Instructions - Add baking soda to a bowl, or a jar.

I didn't have one, so I had to improvise with a paper one (+spil a lot). Notes - Shake the bottle before each use for a few seconds. - In this recipe, I added 16 drops of essential oil. If the smell is not strong enough - you can add a couple more drops. (up to 20-30 in total) - Do not spray directly on clothes, wood, furniture, fabrics, curtains, or carpets. - Use with caution around children, pets, and pregnant women. FAQ: How does baking soda freshens the air? Baking soda doesn't mask odors - it absorbs them. It eliminates odor particles, so it is ideal for the DIY air freshener. Additionally, an interesting study found that spreading baking soda at the bottom of waste bins can help neutralize garbage odor by 70%. ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25445259/)) How long will the homemade air freshener last? The homemade air freshener can last for 4 - 6 months. To make it last longer, keep it away from direct sunlight. That's because sunlight can quickly cause changes in the chemical composition of essential oils (and to make them less effective). How long the smell last in the room? The DIY air freshener won't last as long, and it isn't intrusive like the commercial ones. This means that more frequent spraying may be necessary. It depends on how much you spray in one go, how big the room is, and what essential oil you use. That's because some essential oils (like citrus essential oils) evaporate faster than others. Is the DIY air freshener safe for pets? No - if you have a pet, avoid using it. Essential oils are toxic to dogs, cats, or birds. Never apply pure essential oils topically or orally to your pet because it can be dangerous (especially tea tree oil). I would recommend making an essential oil-free air freshener that's safe for animals and is non-toxic. Soon, I will share a recipe that is pet-safe, so stay tuned for that! Will I get oily spots around my house? No - essential oils are different from fatty oils. You shouldn't get any oily spots when combined with water. Plus, this recipe has alcohol, which makes the air freshener evaporate quickly. Why the spray looks cloudy? It is a natural reaction, and it can happen when you combine certain ingredients. It doesn't affect the quality of the spray. Sum up There you have it - the easiest way to ditch the toxic air fresheners, once and for all.
