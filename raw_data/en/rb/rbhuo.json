Viewed in its totality, our logo encapsulates our vision, mission and orientation towards the future.Prof Lim Mong King Chairman chairman 's statementchairman's statement Z 2002 was an exciting time to be at HSA. In our second year, we forged ahead to build up thecritical capabilities and strategic alliances that would positionus to respond effectively to the rapid changes at the local leveland on a global scale. health sciences authority 05Challenges and Opportunities New therapeutic goods, technologies, techniques and tools that emerge ever more rapidly than before, have offered numerousopportunities and shaped expectations for an improved qualityof life. The pace of globalisation and information technologyadvancement further allows information to flow seamlessly andvirtually across geographical boundaries resulting in heightenedconsumer demand for shorter time-to-market and a greater diversityof health products. We can be sure that just as certainly as science, medicine and technology will advance, threats and risks will develop andproliferate at a similar pace. In recent times, the widespreadconcern on terrorism, including potential bio-terrorism, calls forbetter measures to protect public health and safety. Equallyalarming has been the emergence of new infectious diseases,which requires us to respond quickly, for instance, with newscreening measures to protect the integrity of the national bloodsupply from Severe Acute Respiratory Sy ndrome (S ARS). And as economies become challenged with declining growth andunemployment, the lure of counterfeit and substandard healthproducts will put greater pressures on our post-market surveillanceand analytical testing capabilities. Risks abound in the community and in the world of regulatory and scientific activities. Too much regulation stifles enterprisechairman 's statement health sciences authority 06and progress but too little regulation exposes the community to unnecessary hazards. Too cautious a scientific approach is resource-consuming without effectiveness but too little attention toscientific methodology undermines confidence and objectivity. Building Momentum These challenges have significantly shaped our future directionsand actions, strengthened our systems and processes, and alsopropelled us to forge new frontiers in strategic alliances in oursecond year of operation. As a science-based agency, we have identified enterprise risk management as a primary strategic tool to a ddress the increasing complexity of challenges yet exploiting each opportunity to fulfilour role to safeguard public health and safety and serve theadministration of justice. Our enterprise risk register and indiv idual risk registers at the centres ' and departments ' levels have enforced systematic decision-making and contributed to a greater insightinto risks and their impacts, thereby improving our safety, qualityand business performance. In 2002, we gained momentum in establishing strategic alliances with our stakeholders and international benchmark regulatorycounterparts as well as being an integral part of regional andglobal harmonisation initiatives.health sciences authority 07These efforts serve to develop a more robust and responsive regulatory framework and scientific capabilities that are inline with current international best practices and trends.Through strategic alliances and collaborations, we also expandthe breadth and depth of information and expertise that wecan draw upon to make not just timely regulatory decisions,but also cutting-edge scientific j udgements. There is no d oubt that such ties serve the optimal use of limited resources formaximum public protection. I am happy to highlight that in May 2002, we have taken a significant step forward by our first major collaboration with oneof our key counterpart regulatory agencies, the Therapeutic GoodsAdministration (TGA) of Australia. Signing the Memorandum of Intention of Co-operation with TGA marked an important milestone in the regulatory arena as itsealed the already strong ties between HSA and TGA, and servedas a model for regulatory co-ordination in the Asia Pacific region.In addition, the Memorandum enhanced initiatives to harmoniseregulatory standards amidst the diversity of regulatory approachesacross national borders. Amongst the many harmonisation initiatives which we are actively involved in, I am particularly pleased to note that we played akey organising role in the 9th Global Harmonisation Task Force Conference held in May 2002 in Singapore. This conference sawa congregation of global key decision-makers from the industryand governments in the regulation of medical devices. Therewere eminent representatives from the US Food and DrugAdministration, Australia TGA, Canada Therapeutic ProductsDirectorate, UK Medicines and Healthcare products RegulatoryAgency and European Commission. This participation hassignificantly raised our global profile in the regulatory arena andaffirmed our commitment to forge a common direction for theharmonisation of medical device regulation in Asia via the AsianHarmonisation Working Party. Concluding Remarks In our second year, I am gratified to note that we have continuedthe momentum built up from the previous year. It gives me greatpleasure to convey my appreciation to the management and staffof HSA for their commitment, professionalism and contributionto the organisation and the delivery of our public mission. Iwould also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the BoardMembers for their advice and guidance in our journey to ourstrategic designation in being world class for scientific andregulatory expertise in health sciences.chairman 's statementDr Clarence Tan Chief Executive Officer ceo's report ceo's report Z This year, HSA has advanced in our journey towards our strategic designation in being world class for scientific and regulatory expertise in health sciences. health sciences authority 09ceo's report Coming of Age We have made good progress in developing our new regulatory capability in the evaluation of new drugs not previously approvedin other countries. Building this regulatory capability complementsthe growth of research and development in the pharmaceuticalindustry in Singapore insofar as to make Singapore the origin ofnew and innovative quality drugs. This strategic direction is anintegral part of the infrastructure to develop Singapore as aregional medical hub and as a world hub for the biomedicalsciences research and development. Being in our early developmental stage, I am proud to note that during the year, we have evaluated 8 new drug applications notpreviously approved in other countries. This represented thehighest number of completed evaluations in a year, a few ofwhich were completed ahead of other overseas benchmarkregulatory agencies. As with developed countries, our regulatory framework is based on a risk management approach designed to ensure public healthand safety, while at the same time freeing the industry from anyunnecessary regulatory burden.As efficient and effective risk managers, who strategically apply science and law to protect consumers, we need to balance therewards of biomedical and technological advancement with theinherent risk every breakthrough carries. During the year, westrengthened our regulatory framework for clinical trials to enhancethe safety of trial subjects and improve process and accountabilitywithin the institutions undertaking the trials. In anticipationof more biologics as the noble innovations of biomedical researchand development, we have proactively set up a biologics unit forthe consolidation of expertise to evaluate such products. Further in our role as risk managers, we need to weigh the risk and benefits of every regulatory decision, and knowing that everytherapeutic product in the market has the potential of adversereactions, we engage post-market surveillance measures forcomprehensive ongoing vigilance. During the year, we saw promising outcomes of our efforts in the enhancement of the pharmacovigilance programme. We receiveda record number of 801 adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports fromthe healthcare professionals, a 40% increase of reports comparedto 2001. The increase was a good indicator of the continual health sciences authority 10ceo's report effort made to promote the reporting of any suspected ADR encountered by our health professionals for collation and furtherinvestigations at HSA, as well as the enhancement of theinfrastructure for reporting that leveraged on the wide applicationsof information technology. Spontaneous ADR reporting and monitoring has been recognised internationally as a powerful and effective tool for the detectionof potential drug safety problems that may arise after the drugshave been marketed and used widely in the general population.In 2002, through the local ADR reports received, drug safetyproblems associated with Slim 10 and jarem encok were detectedand subsequently tested and found to be adulterated with syntheticwestern drugs. In the case of Slim 10, it was a defining regulatory event in the year that signified the coming-of-age of the awareness onthe interplay of regulation in a globalised world. Our quickaction from detection to its market removal illustrated theeffectiveness and timeliness of our regulatory performance.The successful prosecution of the importer and distributor ofthe product also drove home the message on the importance offulfilment and compliance to the statutory obligations definedin the regulatory framework. As similar products, though packaged and marketed differently, were also found in other countries, there was much informationexchange and collaboration among a few regulators who were also confronted with the challenge to race against time to establishthe causation of the ADR observed in their countries. There wasno doubt that this incident highlighted the need for and benefitsof our close co-operation in post-market surveillance, investigationand enforcement with our overseas counterparts in an ever growingglobalised market. Building Capabilities The roadmap to our strategic destination of being a world classregulator for health products and a one-stop centre of excellencein transfusion medicine, forensic and analytical expertise, dependson continued investments in building our people expertise,equipment and technological infrastructure, and modernisedfacilities that keep pace with best practices and rapidly emergingtechnologies. Over the last two years, we invited world renown experts to teach and share their domain knowledge and audit our systems. In2002, we sent more of our best to learn from benchmark agenciesand participate in global professional and industry events. In a move to meet the high expectations of our stakeholders to provide more complex and higher value-added forensic, investigativeand analytical services, we invested in new state-of-the-artequipment that would yield rapid, sensitive and specific analysis. health sciences authority 11ceo's report The delivery of efficient and effective services must also rest on a strong and modern infrastructure. Exploiting informationtechnology is one of our cornerstones in maximising resourceutilisation and operational efficiency. During the year, weupgraded our network infrastructure and worked towards e-enabling many services by harnessing the power of the internetto make regulatory dealings more convenient for our industryplayers and blood donations more accessible to our blood donors. Facility development and upgrades also continued during the year, and they were done with a strong commitment to serveour customers first and well. A new Apheresis Suite at ourBloodbank@HSA has enhanced the environment for our altruisticblood donors, and likewise, a more co nductive and comfortable reception area at the Mortuary@HSA for distressed next-of-kin.Emphasis was also placed on improving occupational safety systemat our facilities to handle Bio-Safety Level 3+ type of autopsycases. This initiative would increase our capability capacity tohandle situations of mass disaster, infectious disease outbreaksand bio-terrorism. Achieving Excellence The ability to learn and put into practice what has been learnt isthe competitive edge. Thus, we are proud to have attained thePeople Developer Standard, another milestone in our organisationalexcellence journey. It means that our people development andtraining system is comparable to the best in Singapore.We also recognise that a culture of innovation and enterprise is one of the key critical success factors in driving our workforcebehaviour and ensuring robustness in performance in a challengingoperating environment which is becoming more sophisticatedeach day. In 2002, we unveiled an integrated innovation framework that is built upon our vision, mission and core values to harnesscreativity through various strategies like risk management, valuemanagement and corporate excellence systems. Our innovationframework, based on three guiding principles viz focus on vision, freedom with responsibility and frontier - boldly going forward,aims to build up a self-propagating and self-sustaining pool ofinnovation that will sustain our journey towards excellence. Weare seeking recognition of our innovation capability developmentvia the application of the Singapore Innovation Class by FY 2003. In our second year, we were pleased to achieve more third-party endorsements of our systems and processes. Our Centre forAnalytical Science has not only attained the Singapore QualityClass, but also upgraded its Singapore Accreditation Council - Singapore Laboratory Accreditation Scheme accreditation toISO/IEC 17025 in chemical, biological and environmental testingfields. The latter is a testimony that we have met the internationalstandards for the competence of testing laboratories, and ourclients can therefore exploit this accreditation strategically fortheir overseas markets. health sciences authority 12ceo's report In April 2002, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) invited our Narcotics II Laboratory in ourCentre for Forensic Science to be a reference laboratory for thebiological specimen group. This added to the list of internationalrecognition in which in June 2001, our Narcotics I Laboratorywas made the reference laboratory for analysis of controlled drugsfor seized materials group. As the reference laboratories, weprovide the baseline information that is used to evaluate resultsreported by participating laboratories in UNDCP's bi-annualinternational collaborative exercises. I am pleased to highlight that our pursuit of professional excellence has led to a unique application of existing investigative processesand methodologies by our forensic scientists, resulting in theprompt apprehension of the perpetrator of a high-profile localmurder case. Our forensic scientists have cleverly appliedconventional investigative techniques to create a new application,a first in the world, to prove that the exhibit found at the sceneof crime matched that found in the criminal 's dwelling.In the domain of transfusion medicine, our internationally renown Centre for Transfusion Medicine co nducted a 17-day training course in April 2002, and shared our cutting-edge system ofquality management in blood banking to senior blood bank officersfrom 11 countries in the Western Pacific region. This course wasthe first of a regular series in the World Health Organisation 's initiatives to enhance a safer global blood standard and supply. Looking Ahead I am proud that the HSA family has evolved into a cohesiveand committed whole over the last two years as we workedtogether steadily and prevailed in the face of difficult challengesand changes. We have achieved some progress towards realising our objectives in our second year. We will continue to persevere and ensure weremain a ready, relevant and responsive organisation that candeliver our mission to excel in applying science to supporthealthcare services and regulation, serve the administration ofjustice and enhance safety in our community. health sciences authority 13leadership changes Prof Hang Chang Chieh Dr Tan Chor Hiangleadership changes Z HSA would like to express its deepest appreciation to Professor Hang Chang Chieh who relinquished hisposition as Chairman of HSA on 1 February 2003.

We carry out pre-marketing evaluation of medicinal products before they can be marketed in Singapore. The products currentlyregulated include western medicinal products, Chinese proprietarymedicines and cosmetic products. The regulatory framework forhealth supplements is being developed. We are also responsiblefor the regulation of clinical trials in Singapore and the provisionof unbiased drug information to health professionals and thepublic. In addition, we administer and enforce the Smoking(Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco) Act in supportof the government 's efforts to discourage smoking and promote public health. We regulate medicinal and other health-related products under the Medicines Act, the Poisons Act, the Sale of Drugs Act, theMedicines (Advertisement and Sale) Act and the Misuse of DrugRegulations. Post-marketing regulatory activities include qualitysurveillance programmes, routine inspections and investigationsinto contraventions of legislation. When necessary, legal actionis taken against the offenders by way of compounding orprosecution in court.The spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions by doctors and other health professionals is another important tool usedto keep continued vigilance on the safety of all marketed drugsin Singapore. In addition, we inspect and license pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers/wholesale dealers in accordance with currentinternational Good Manufacturing Practice and Good DistributionPractice standards respectively. This ensures the production ofgood quality medicines and preservation of their quality down thesupply chain from the manufacturers to distributors and retailers.CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFM health sciences authority 27Our Centre for Drug Evaluation (CDE) is an integral part of the infrastructure to develop Singapore as a regional medicalhub and as a world hub for the life sciences research anddevelopment. Funded by the Agency for Science, Technology andResearch, CDE complements the regulatory role of CPA in drugevaluation with the primary focus on the evaluation of new drugsnot previously approved in other countries. This regulatorycapability will help the pharmaceutical industry grow its researchand development in Singapore and make Singapore the origin ofnew and innovative quality drugs. We aim to complete evaluationwithin timelines similar to those of benchmark agencies such asthe US Food and Drug Administration. Evaluations of New Drug Applications During the year, we evaluated 8 new drug applications that werenot previously approved in other countries, bringing the totalnumber of completed evaluations to 18 since 1998. This representedthe highest number of completed evaluations in a year, a few ofwhich were completed ahead of other overseas benchmarkregulatory agencies. An example was Cialis, an erectile dysfunctionprescription drug that we approved in January 2003, ahead ofUS approval. In closely tracking evaluation timelines, we continuedto ensure that the science-based assessment of product safety,quality and efficacy to safeguard public health was not compromisedthrough a system of closely coordinating the inputs of our expertevaluators, peer reviews and the Medicines Advisory Committee.Pre-market Abridged Evaluation and Licensing of Medicinal Products Pre-market abridged evaluations are required if a western medicinal product has already been approved by at least onedrug regulatory agency or if a generic medicinal product ismanufactured locally. Once these abr idged evaluations ensure that the product meets the criteria of safety, quality and efficacy,a product licence for the Singapore market will be granted. The total number of product licences (including renewals and variations) issued for the year was 2,525.

Regulation of Clinical Trials In the year under review, 195 new clinical trial certificates wereissued. The more common clinical trials co nducted were for oncology, gastroenterology, cardiology and anti-infective products.Licensing of Manufacturers, Assemblers, Importers, Wholesale Dealers and Pharmacies During the year, we issued 61 licences to manufacturers and assemblers of western medicinal products, Chinese proprietarymedicines, cosmetic products and controlled drugs. In the same period, 297 wholesale dealers ' licences, 427 Form A*, 260 pharmacy certificates and 8 Good Manufacturing Practice(GMP) certificates were issued. We inspected 522 sites to ensurethat products were being manufactured, stored and distributedin compliance with GMP and Good Distribution Practice (GDP)standards.

Good Manufacturing Practice In April 2002, CPA was invited to participate in the PharmaceuticalInspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) delegation assessingTaiwan 's application for PIC/S membership. The objective was to assess the GMP Inspection and Licensing system of its NationalLaboratories of Food and Drug.keeping watch CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFM In addition, we also participated in a PIC/S Joint Audit, arranged by PIC/S and Australia 's Therapeutic Goods Administration. A PIC/S Joint Audit is intended to harmonise and calibrate theGMP audit approach, knowledge and skills of the auditors toestablish consistency of GMP audits throughout the variousPIC/S member authorities. Regulation of Chinese Proprietary Medicines As at 31 March 2003, the total number of licensed Chineseproprietary medicine (CPM) importers, manufacturers, repackersand wholesalers stood at 194, 23, 30 and 289 respectively, andthe total number of CPM products listed was 10,224. During theyear, there were 3,495 applications for CPM product listing, and1,392 products were allowed to be listed. Enhanced Regulatory Control of CPM In August 2002, the enhancement of the control of CPM was announced, comprising the following additional measures: ZFrom 1 January 2003, CPM products should carry an additional label \"Allowed for sale as a Chinese Proprietary Medicine \" on the outer sales packs in both English and Chinese. This move would help consumers differentiate CPM from western drugs. ZFrom 1 January 2004, only test reports issued by accredited laboratories will be recognised and accepted by HSA for high-risk CPM products. This will enhance the reliability of test reports at the pre-marketing assessment stage for high-risk CPMproducts and for their subsequent imports. ZOur existing quality surveillance programme has been strengthened. The testing protocol has been enhanced in terms ofrisk assessment, with more targeted testing based on product indications and claims. All local and overseas CPM manufacturerswill eventually be subject to periodic GMP audits according to international standards to weed out unreliable sources,including overseas on-site audits for manufacturers not already subject to PIC/S standards.* Form C is a licence to import and deal generally in poisons (items as listed in the Poisons Act) by wholesale and retail.health sciences authority 32Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Programme In 2002, we received a record number of 801 adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports from the healthcare professionals, a 40% increasecompared to 2001. The increase was a good outcome indicatorof the continual effort made to promote the reporting of anysuspected adverse drug reactions encountered to thePharmacovigilance Unit for collation and further investigationwhen necessary. Spontaneous ADR reporting and monitoring hasbeen recognised internationally as a powerful and effective toolfor the detection of potential drug safety problems that may ariseafter the drugs have been marketed and used widely in the generalpopulation. Through local ADR reports received in 2002, drugsafety problems associated with Slim 10 and jarem encok weredetected. They were found to be adulterated with syntheticwestern drugs when tested subsequently. 5 \"Dear Healthcare Professional \" letters on new safety information including hormone replacement therapy, Eprex, and pure red cellaplasia, kava-kava and liver toxicities and Slim 10 were issued toinform the healthcare professionals and the public on major drugsafety issues that had resulted in significant regulatory actions. Leveraging on the wide applications of information technology, we established an e-mail address database of more than 4,000doctors and pharmacists in Singapore to facilitate the disseminationof urgent drug safety information to our healthcare professionalsin a timely manner. In addition, to facilitate reporting of ADRby the healthcare professionals, an online reporting channel wasdeveloped to enable these professionals to submit reportselectronically through the Internet.keeping watch CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFM Regulation of Health Supplements Pending the implementation of regulatory control of health supplements in 2004, an enquiry service was established tohandle enquiries relating to health supplements from the tradeand the public. We managed a total of 5,221 enquiries in theyear under review. In January 2002, we issued a guidance letter to health supplement traders for the voluntary withdrawal of piper methysticum - commonly known as kava-kava - products, following overseas adverse drug reaction reports of hepatic toxicity associated withits consumption. Subsequently in July 2002, we banned theimport and sale of kava-kava products altogether. This precautionarymove was made after consideration of the German Federal Institutefor Drugs and Medical Device 's completion of a safety review of kava-kava and its subsequent action to ban products containingkava-kava. Legislative ame ndments to include k ava-kava and its constituents under the control of the Poisons Act were alsoinstituted that month. Regulation of Cosmetics During the year, we issued 11,101 cosmetic product licences.These included new cosmetic product licences, renewed licencesand amended product licences. During the same period, 490import licences were also issued. In February 2002, we reviewed the cosmetic licensing processes to provide the industry flexibility in applying for a single licencefor palettes of fixed colours, in addition to the current systemof a single licence for each cosmetic product. Companies couldnow choose either scheme to apply for their cosmetic licencesto optimise the fee quantum to be paid.health sciences authority 33Regulation of Medical Advertisements and Sales Promotions We regulate medical advertisements and sales promotion for medicinal products to ensure that the information presentedis accurate and not misleading. During the year, we issued1,468 permits for medical advertisements out of 1,536applications received. Following a comprehensive review co nducted from November 2002 to February 2003, all indirect advertisements and consumereducation materials for Prescription Only Medicine (POM) wouldbe classified as medical advertisements to distinguish genuineconsumer education materials from indirect advertisements ofPOM. This followed some cases of indirect or \"consumer education \" advertising that were construed as POM advertising. As a council member of the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore, we continued to provide advice for the clarificationof issues related to the advertisement of medicinal and health-related products. We also worked with the Singapore Associationof Pharmaceutical Industries to explore the role of the industryin co-regulating medical advertisements and sales promotions. Investigation, Surveillance and Prosecution Like our benchmark regulatory agencies, we detect health fraudthrough a variety of ways. We may identify a violation or a suspectedfraudulent product through our inspectors ' routine market-placesurveys, searches on the Internet, ADR reports, complaints from consumers, healthcare professionals and trade competitors, orthrough referrals from other government authorities. During the year, 401 cases from various sources were investigated which led to the recall of 28 products. Of these, 19 cases wereprosecuted in court resulting in $231,500 of total fines imposedand two cases with CPA CFM health sciences authority 34To allay public concerns on slimming products following the recall of Slim 10, we tested all 45 locally listed CPM marketed forslimming and weight loss in June 2002, and 163 health supplementsand 11 popular jamu products marketed for slimming in August2002. All test results indicated that the samples were free fromadulteration of synthetic western drugs including a comprehensiverange of western pharmaceutical agents related to slimming. During the year, we also co nducted raids, after a period of close surveillance on peddlers involved in the sale of illegal medicinesnear markets, MRT stations, temples and other roadside areas.Legal actions against the offenders were taken as some unlisted CPM and unregistered medicinal products seized were found tocontain sildenafil (active ingredient in Viagra \u00ae), steroid ointments and anti-fungal preparations. To address the growing concern of illegal imports of medicinal preparations, we enhanced our co-operation with other governmentagencies. A guideline on procedures for the clearance of hand-carried medicinal and health-related products was issued to theCustoms and Excise Department (since reorganised into theImmigration and Checkpoints Authority) officers to help them inkeeping watch CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFM Investigations into Adulteration of Slim 10 and Prosecution Actions Slim 10, listed as a CPM, generated a series of ADR reports from end March 2002. These reports of suspected liver injury and hyperthyroidism rapidly triggered a cascade of investigations and regulatory actions against the product, including thewithdrawal of the product from the market on 19 April 2002. Publicity was used to warn consumers and health professionalson the adulterated batches that entered the market. Following the investigations, the importer, Health Biz Pte Ltd, was prosecuted for 9 charges under the Medicines Act, namely 8 counts of selling Slim 10 without having first confirmed that the imported consignments were free from poisons and othersynthetic substances, and one charge for failing to keep import records of Slim 10 brought into Singapore. The importer,who pleaded guilty to the charges, was convicted and sentenced to the maximum fine of $5,000 on each of the nine chargesin September 2002. Following the conviction, we also revoked the importer's Import licence and Wholesale Dealer's licence. The local distributor, TV Media Pte Ltd, was also prosecuted for its role in the distribution and sale of Slim 10. The distrib utor was fined $64,000 in July 2002, after it had pleaded guilty to 20 counts of unlicensed wholesale dealing and, more significantl y, 8 counts of charges relating to its sale of Slim 10 after HSA had recalled the product. The findings of our investigations and regulatory actions also featured in a Coroner's Inquiry into a death suspected to be cau sed by Slim 10. The Inquiry subsequently ruled that the death was caused by negligence on the part of the importer of Slim 10.health sciences authority 35identifying products controlled by HSA and to prevent their illegal import. We investigated the cases surrounding such seizures forfurther information and leads, so as to stem out the source ofthe illegal imports. We also reviewed the illegal sale of codeine-containing cough mixtures with the Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Immigrationand Registration Department (since reorganised into theImmigration and Checkpoints Authority) and the Central NarcoticsBureau. In April 2002, these government agencies, in a co-ordinated effort, co nducted raids in the vicinity of North Br idge Road and Stamford Road, nightspots in the city centre and atBalestier Road. The joint operation led to the arrest of 56immigration offenders as well as abusers and peddlers of coughmixtures containing codeine. Large quantities of codeine-containing cough mixtures were seized from these offenders. As an agency that protects public health and safety, we keep in touch with the various stakeholders and respond swiftly toalerts and feedback. Following media feedback in July 2002, we promptly deterred a range of luo han kuo health supplementsfrom making medicinal claims in their promotional materials,and the media highlighted the misleading and medicinal claimsmade for the products. Tobacco Regulation During the year, we granted 7,489 tobacco retailer licences, andtook to task 7 retailers for selling cigarettes without valid licences. We intensified our enforcement efforts to prohibit smoking by youths under 18 years old. The increased surveillance resultedin a total of 4,153 underage youths caught smoking or possessingcigarettes. Some 1,554 young offenders were compounded and253 were prosecuted in court. In FY 2002, 384 cigarette samples were sampled from the market and tested. The results showed 99% compliance rate of the legallimit of tar and nicotine contents in cigarettes retailed locally.Out of these samples, one product indicated a tar content levelthat exceeded the legal limit, and with our confirmatorylaboratory test results, we took enforcement action against thedistributor involved. During the year, we met regularly with the Customs and Excise Department to provide advice and assistance on health warningexemptions and approvals for checks on imported cigarettes.These sessions reaffirmed our commitment to support thegovernment 's initiative for mandatory health warning labels for tobacco products as a means to inform the public of the healthhazards from the use of tobacco.keeping watch CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFM health sciences authority 36Based on the recommendation of the Committee on Smoking Control that provided overall policy direction for the NationalSmoking Control Programme, the ame ndments to the Sm oking (Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco) (Ame ndment) Bill were proposed and passed by the Parliament on 31 October2002. Among the various ame ndments, licensing of importers and distributors would be required and powers of investigationfor authorised officers under the Act would be refined. Cigarettesimported or sold in Singapore would list other constituents inaddition to tar and nicotine and the fine quantum of under-agedsmoking offences would be increased. Grey Area Products Task Force In January 2003, we formed a working group with the Agri-Food& Veterinary Authority to a ddress issues of concern pertaining to product classification of \"grey area \" food products, which might be fortified with herbal ingredients. We also set up a Grey Area Products Task Force in March 2003 to look into other health products that did not fit clearly underexisting classifications. Biologics Task Force Research and development in new technologies in biotechnologyand genomics has been leading to an increasing scientificcomplexity of products including more biologicals in the pipeline.In order to accurately assess the readiness of these products tobe marketed in Singapore and help these innovative productsreach our patients as quickly as possible, we proactively set upa Biologics Task Force to a ddress the regulation and evaluation of biological products.Compliance and Complementary Medicines Division In August 2002, we realigned our organisational structure to forma new Compliance & Complementary Medicines Division in orderto meet the new challenges in regulating complementary medicineslike traditional medicines and health supplements. Thereorganisation would serve to optimise the use of resources andthe collective knowledge and experience to better respond to theneeds of the various stakeholders in Singapore. The Year Ahead As part of our ongoing broader efforts to strengthen and moderniseour pharmaceutical and health-related products regulatorysystem to protect public health and safety as well as to make safeand effective drugs available to Singaporeans, we have lined upseveral new initiatives in the coming year. Looking ahead, someof these include: ZThe implementation of a new verification route that offersfaster assessment timelines for certain categories of medicinalproducts that are already registered in benchmark agencies.The pilot phase is currently underway. ZA new drug registration guide and application form that willbe in line with the new International Conference of Harmonisationand ASEAN common technical dossier requirements and formats.This initiative will facilitate the objective of the ASEAN FreeTrade Area through a common template for the submission ofdrug watch CFS sciences authority 37ZThe implementation of a new clinical trials regulatory framework based on a risk-based approach. The new framework aims toensure high standards of clinical research and safety to protectthe trials ' subjects without impeding trials ' timelines and the progress of research in Singapore. ZThe implementation of the health supplements regulatoryframework in phases. ZThe launch of the Pharmaceutical Registration and InformationSystem (prism@hsa), an integrated electronic licensing systemto support various activities in the regulatory systems. Theprism@hsa system will enable the electronic submission of alllicence, permit and certificate applications from traderepresentatives dealing in western medicinal products, Chineseproprietary medicines, health supplements, cosmetics andtobacco. In addition to facilitating the application process,which can be carried out during out-of-office hours, prism@hsawill allow applicants to track the approval status of theirapplications online. REGULATING MEDICAL DEVICES Our Centre for Medical Device Regulation (CMDR) keeps a close tab on the rapidly advancing technologies thatresult in a proliferation of new medical devices. Our objectiveis to protect public health and safety by discharging regulatorycontrols through a programme of pre-market assessment ofproducts, manufacturing controls and post-market monitoring.We take all necessary and reasonable steps to ensure that medical devices in Singapore are safe, of appropriate quality, perform asintended and are properly used. We seek to ensure that thevaluable new technologies are made available to the clinicalcommunity, patients and consumers expeditiously while preventingunsafe or ineffective devices from reaching the market. We also administer the Contact Lens Practitioners Act through the registration and licensing of contact lens practitioners and theenforcement of the Act and its regulations. As at end March 2003,there were 406 licensed contact lens practitioners in Singapore.keeping watch CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFM health sciences authority 38Voluntary Product Registration Scheme In April 2002, a Voluntary Product Registration Scheme for higher- risk medical devices was introduced. By end-March 2003, we hadreceived 1,047 case applications and encouraging response andsupport from the medical device industry. The scheme, which was introduced as an interim measure to statutory controls, offered all stakeholders a foretaste of thevarious levers of regulatory controls. During this phase, wemaintained regular dialogues and interactions to guide andeducate the industry and to receive valuable feedback to improvethe regulatory process. Each industry stakeholder also had theopportunity to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed medicaldevice regulation framework and to participate in the strategicdevelopment of the programme.The regulatory framework would also consist of maintaining an efficient and effective post-market surveillance system. Thiswould include the analysis and prompt investigation of adverseincident reports relating to medical devices and taking anynecessary action to safeguard public health. To date, the industryhas shown good support for the vigilance programme throughthe increased reporting of adverse incidents under the voluntaryscheme. During the year, medical device manufacturers submittedincident reports of 15 product recalls and 4 adverse incidentsrelating to medical devices worldwide. These companies alsoduly followed up with the appropriate corrective actions includingrecalls of products that were sold in Singapore. The Year Ahead In the next year, we will continue with the preparatory worksfollowing the introduction of a statutory framework for medicaldevices. As in the voluntary scheme, our main focus is to continueto engage, consult and communicate with the industry stakeholderson the regulations and procedures, while closely monitoringoutcomes and performance. A Medical Device Licensing and Control System (medics@hsa) is being developed to support and enhance the operational efficiencyfor the regulation of medical devices. Looking ahead, themedics@hsa will provide a web-based channel for business partnersto make convenient transactions 24 hours a day for productapplications, registration and licensing. medics@hsa will alsofeature a useful online device register.keeping watch CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFM health sciences authority 39ENSURING RADIATION SAFETY Our Centre for Radiation Protection (CRP) administers and enforces the Radiation Protection Act (Chapter 262), whichcontrols all radioactive materials and irradiating apparatus suchas X-ray machines, linear accelerators, electron beam welders,ion implanters, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasoundapparatus, lasers for medical, industrial and entertainmentpurposes, microwave ovens and ultra-violet sun tanning lamps. Services provided by our 7 laboratories include personal monitoring of all radiation workers, testing of imported food and industrialsamples for radioactive contaminants, testing for leakage ofsealed radioactive sources and calibration of radiation measuringinstruments.Ionising and Non-ionising Radiation Licensing and Inspections During the year, 20,904 licences were issued, for the purposes of import, export, sale, possession and use of irradiating apparatusand radioactive materials and for the transport of radioactivematerials. 1,467 endorsements were given for the import / exportof components of irradiating apparatus without the radiationemitting components, and 101 endorsements were made for shipscarrying nuclear consignments such as nuclear fuel rods, uraniumhexafluoride with natural uranium or enriched uranium to transitin Singapore. We also made 419 inspections at medical, dental and veterinary practice premises and industrial and educational institutions,compared to 397 inspections in 2001. The inspections wererequired for premises using ionising radiation (IR) irradiatingapparatus or radioactive materials. Checks were made to assessthat the facilities and equipment were in proper condition andthat radiation levels at places accessible to the public were withinlimits specified in the regulations. We conducted a further 26 inspections for premises using non- ionising radiation (NIR) apparatus and 14 surveys at handphonebase-stations and radio / television transmitting stations. Further, to ensure that radiation levels emitting from microwave ovens sold in Singapore were below that specified in theRegulations, we checked 29 new models of microwave ovens fromdifferent manufacturers. keeping watch CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFMX-Ray Mammography Quality Assurance Programme As part of our continuing effort in ensuring radiation safety, we placed emphasis on quality control and assurance in medicalapplications of X-rays. In July 2002, we collaborated with theHealth Promotion Board to ensure that all mammography X-rayfacilities had the necessary quality-control programme in placeat the clinics. By year-end, we inspected and certified more than10 clinics with mammography X-ray facilities. Personal Monitoring Service As part of the regulatory control, we monitor all radiation workersin Singapore closely. During the year, more than 72,000thermoluminescent dosimeters were issued to these workers. Thesedosimeters were processed monthly to ensure that the radiationdoses were within limits specified in the regulations. The numberof overdose cases investigated by us decreased to 40 this year,from 46 cases in 2001, occurring mainly in industrial radiography. Additional dosimeters in the form of rings were issued to monitor the radiation dose to the fingers for those workers handlingradioactive materials that emitted beta radiation or low energygamma radiation. Wipe Tests and Radioactivity Analysis During the year, we performed a total of 515 wipe tests, comparedto 470 tests in 2001, at establishments that use sealed radioactivesources in industrial, medical and research applications.We also co nducted radioactivity analysis on food samples. In 2002, the number of food samples tested and certified free fromradioactive contaminants increased by 415 to 1,770 samples. In addition, we were involved in the detection of radioactivity levels in environmental samples, such as soil and water, copperand tin slags, steel rebars, marble, granite, etc. Ionising Radiation Dosimetry Our Secondary Standards Dosimetry Laboratory calibrated a totalof 347 radiation-monitoring devices used by companies andhospitals in Singapore. Our laboratory, the national referencecentre for radiation protection and environmental dosimetry,was established with the support of the International AtomicEnergy Agency and the World Health Organisation as part of theinternational network of secondary reference laboratories. Nuclear Safety and Emergency Planning During the year, we were engaged as the project consultant forthe new remote radiation monitoring system that was successfullyinstalled and commissioned at Changi Naval Base. We are now able to access dose readings of detectors at two monitoring stations at Changi and Sembawang wharves viacomputers and telephone lines. These stations provide 24-hourmonitoring to give early warning in the event of a radiologicalaccident during the visits of nuclear powered warships. In 2002,8 such warships visited Singapore. health sciences authority 40keeping watch CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 41Radiation Consultancy and Training We provided a total of 79 consultancy services on all aspects of ionising and non-ionising radiation protection to industries,ministries, statutory boards, hospitals and the general public.The services covered a wide spectrum from radioactive wastemanagement system, radiation accident procedures and emergencyplanning, radiation shielding requirements, radiation exposurelimits, choice and use of radiation instruments, radioactivity inbuilding materials and industrial raw materials and extremely lowfrequency fields from transformer and high-tension switch rooms. To raise the general standard of radiation safety in industrial radiography, we started a training course in October 2002 onradiation protection for industrial radiographers. The course aimed to provide sufficient knowledge of the radiation hazards associatedwith the industrial radiographers ' work and the awareness of appropriate protective measures so as to minimise the occurrenceof radiation accidents. Lectures and training on radiation safety were also delivered to medical doctors, dentists, undergraduates and radiation workersin hospitals, universities and commercial companies. Under a memorandum with the International Atomic Energy Agency, wealso provided training to a consultant radiologist from the MyanmarGeneral Hospital in radiation protection, quality assurance inradio-diagnostic and planning and preparedness for radiologicalemergency in the event of an accident or incident. The Year Ahead As part of our ongoing efforts in upholding radiation safety, wewill continue to promote radiation protection training andeducation locally and regionally. In our efforts to ensure qualitycontrol and assurance in medical applications of X-rays, we willcontinue our collaborations with the Health Promotion Board sothat all mammography X-ray facilities have the necessary qualitycontrol programme in place.

It combines both highly qualified and experiencedscientific expertise with state-of-the-art instrumentation. Through our 7 laboratories in CAS, we provide analytical and consulting services to regulatory agencies and private organisationson a wide variety of products to safeguard public health andsafety. These include the quality and safety of food, drugs andcosmetics, the statutory limits for tar and nicotine in cigarettes,environmental and industrial health standards and classificationof liquors. During the year in review, 57,335 tests were carried out compared to 61,893 tests in the previous year. Turn-around time of sampleshowever, improved from 11.5 days to 8 days. We were proactive in meeting the high expectations of clients for more complex and higher value-added analytical services. We thusinvested $1.7 million in state-of-the-art equipment and placedemphasis on specialist training for both professional and technicalstaff. Recognising the importance of research as integral to thecontinuing development of a world class laboratory for analyticaltesting, a Research and Development Unit was also set up. Our two WHO Collaborating Centres continued to work very closely with the WHO on international activities. The WHO CollaboratingCentre for Food Contamination Monitoring submitted 12,632 delivering services CFS CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 59results of food contaminants from the national food surveillance programme to WHO in 2002. These results provided usefulinformation for WHO to make global comparison with otherparticipating countries and to minimise risks to consumers. TheWHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Quality Assurance evaluatedthree articles and re-examined three international referencesubstances (Cisplation, Methyldopa and Azathioprine) submittedby the WHO Collaborating Centre for Chemical Reference Substancesin Sweden to validate them as international standards. Accreditation of Laboratories under ISO/IEC 17025 Our CAS was the first government laboratory to have beenaccredited by the Singapore Accreditation Council - SingaporeLaboratory Accreditation Scheme (SAC-SINGLAS) under ISO/IEC Guide 25 in 1997. In 2002, our laboratories obtained accreditationunder the new ISO/IEC 17025 after a rigorous two-week surveillanceassessment by independent technical assessors and officials ofSAC-SINGLAS. This achievement means that we have met thehighest international standards for the competence of testinglaboratories and are on par with the best in the world. Singapore Quality Class Our CAS joined the ranks of Singapore Quality Class organisationsin July 2002. This recognition was accorded to organisations thathad achieved commendable levels of performance in their journeyto world-class business excellence. We were ranked top in theHealth and Social Work Sector and credited to have 14 areas inwhich our relative strengths were higher than the industry average.These areas would serve as benchmark for others in the industryto follow. Second Patent Filed Following the filing of a patent to extract bioactive ingredientsfrom herbal medicinal products using pressurised liquid extractionin November 2001, we filed a second patent in 2002. Theinvention involves the extraction of bioactive components frommaterials such as botanical samples and herbal preparations usingpressurised hot water as a solvent at temperatures below 100degrees Celsius. The method utilises less energy than sub-criticalwater extraction methods and may be used under dynamic flowconditions with or without an organic solvent. delivering services CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 60Accredited Laboratories for Chinese Proprietary Medicine Testing As part of the enhanced control measures of Chinese proprietary medicines announced on August 2002, all such products wouldrequire to be tested by accredited laboratories both at the pre-marketing assessment stage and at the point of all subsequentimports. To map out the implementation plan, a study team wentto the national accreditation bodies of China, Taipei and HongKong in December 2002 to understand their accreditation systemsand to visit their testing laboratories for Chinese proprietarymedicines. We would be establishing a list of accredited laboratoriesin these countries to facilitate the testing of such productsoriginating from them. The Mutual Recognition Agreements that the overseas laboratories had signed with SAC-SINGLAS would be used as the basis foraccepting their test results. In the meantime, we would assistthem with all the technical information and test protocols.Similarly, local laboratories would be given such support forChinese proprietary medicine testing. WHO Temporary Advisors In July 2002, one of our scientists was appointed a WHOTemporary Advisor in the WHO Expert Meeting to review theguidelines for the certification of pharmaceutical startingmaterials moving into the international market and the guidelineson good trade and distribution practice. Further, in March 2003,our CAS Director was invited to participate as a WHO TemporaryAdvisor at the WHO Expert Committee Meeting on theSpecifications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Both meetingswere held in Geneva, and Singapore was one of the 4 countriesfrom Asia that were invited.Collaborative Study on the Development of Screening Tests In recognition of our analytical capability and standards, the WHO invited us to participate in a collaborative study on thedevelopment of screening tests and the validation of apharmacopoeia monograph ethambutol HCl. Singapore was the only country in Asiainvited to participate in the study that involved laboratories inNorway, Switzerland, Denmark and the United States. Production and Utilisation of ASEAN Reference Substances At the ASEAN arena, we participated actively in the collaborative project to establish ASEAN reference standards for pharmaceuticaltesting. Stringent tests had to be carried out by at least threechosen member countries on candidate materials before they wereformally adopted as ASEAN reference standards, and Singaporewas involved in all of them. During the year, we coordinatedstudies on phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, dextromethorphanhydrobromide and with the Philippines. Todate, 154 low-cost standards have been produced for the benefitof the ASEAN region. Professional Learning and Teaching Two analytical scientists were awarded overseas training scholarshipsduring the year. This move was part of our aim to build advanceknowledge and competencies, including in traditional Chinesemedicines where their common popularity has been on the rise.delivering services CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 61A visit was also made to the United Ki ngdom 's Laboratory of the Government Chemist, Central Science Laboratory, Health andSafety Laboratory and the Food Research Institute to exploreareas for future collaboration.

This will ensure that we meetthe challenges of globalisation and rapid technological advancement. Globalisation results in lowered market barriers and speedy access. To facilitate trade and promote technological innovation whileprotecting public health and safety, we participate in and supportmutual recognition and harmonisation programmes, which canhelp reduce duplication of resources and promote strategicinformation exchange. The explosive rate of scientific discovery results in new knowledge and a whole new range of technologies and innovative therapeuticproducts. Tapping on a range of international and regionalexpertise allows us to fulfil our public mission effectively as wellas to build the depth and breadth of our professional capabilities. Singapore has identified biomedical sciences as a key pillar of the economy to help propel the country forward to become a regionalmedical and life sciences hub. Our small geographical size makesit imperative for us to establish and strengthen global links. Establishing strategic alliances with our stakeholders and international benchmark regulatory counterparts, and being anintegral part of regional and global harmonisation initiatives,serve to develop a more robust and responsive regulatory frameworkand scientific capabilities that are in line with current internationalbest practices and trends.The quest does not stop here. We also strive for professional accreditation for our essential services in areas like bloodbanking, analytical services, forensic science and forensicmedicine to attain recognised world class standards in ourservices to Singaporeans. ESTABLISHING STRATEGIC ALLIANCES We have sought to formalise strategic alliances with our keystakeholders and international centres of repute by establishingMemoranda of Intention of Co-operation (MOI), Memoranda ofUnderstanding (MOU) and Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRA)with these agencies. The general scope of these agreements include the exchange of information and sharing of databases, sharing and leveraging oneach other 's expertise, development of professional competencies and collaborations in training, education and research. They coverareas such as the regulation of medicinal products including bloodand blood products, Chinese proprietary medicines, othercomplementary health products and medical devices, forensicscience and forensic medicine. Since our formation in April 2001 till March 2003, we have formalised our collaborative partnerships with two CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 66forging partnerships MOI with the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia We signed our first MOI with our Australian regulatory counterpart, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, on 15 May 2002 to jointlycollaborate and co-operate in the regulatory framework forpharmaceuticals, medical devices and complementary healthproducts. This MOI, a significant milestone in the regulatory arena, not only seals the already strong ties between our two organisations,but also serves as a model for regulatory co-ordination in theAsia-Pacific region. In addition, the MOI enhances initiatives toharmonise regulatory standards amidst the diversity of regulatoryapproaches across national borders. Singapore-Australia MRA on Medicinal Product Good Manufacturing Practice Inspection Signed in February 2001 between Singapore and Australia, the Singapore-Australia MRA would facilitate the export of medicinalproducts and reduce the duplication of resources. Australia 's Therapeutic Goods Administration would accept conclusions andrecommendations of audits of medicinal product manufacturerscarried out by HSA 's Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) auditors and vice-versa without the need to re-co nduct site audits.Singapore-Japan Joint Statement on Medicinal Product GMP Inspection A joint statement was signed in January 2002 with Japan 's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare to cover the exchange ofGMP audit reports and certificates relating to pharmaceuticalmanufacturers located in Singapore and Japan. This would greatlyreduce duplication of audit resources especially with the upcomingimplementation of our overseas GMP conformity assessmentprogramme.

During the year, some of the key international events we participated in were: Zthe 16th International Symposium on the Forensic Sciences,Australia, May 2002 Zthe 16th Meeting of the International Association of ForensicSciences, France, September 2002 Zthe Annual Meeting of National Association of Medical Examiners,US, September 2002 Zthe World Quality Congress, UK, September 2002, which providedinsight on the attributes of world class organisations. Zthe International Atomic Energy Agency 46th General Conference,Austria, September 2002, where some of the issues dealt withwere on nuclear safety, safe transport of nuclear materials andnuclear terrorism. We co-sponsored Australia 's draft resolution on \"Measures to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety \". Zthe 30th ASCLD/LAB Annual Conference, USA, October 2002 Zthe International Conference and Exhibition on the Modernisation of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China, November 2002Zthe 55th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of ForensicSciences, USA, February 2003 ZInternational Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources,Austria, March 2003. This conference sought to raise awarenessof the growing global security concern and was organised bythe International Atomic Energy Agency, co-sponsored by theRussian Federation and the US in co-operation with the EuropeanCommission, European Police Office, the International CriminalPolice Organisation and World Customs Organisation. Study Visits to Regulatory Counterparts During the study visits to key regulatory counterparts, discussionson current regulatory issues and best practices in systems andprocesses were co nducted. Further, the visits to research sites allowed the study teams to observe the latest cutting-edgetechnologies and research approaches and network withdevelopment and regulatory affairs personnel from industryand academia. In the year under review, study visits were made to the following: ZFood and Drug Administration, US ZEuropean Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products ZMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, UK ZHealth Canada ZTherapeutic Goods Administration, Australia ZNational Radiological Protection Board, UK ZResearch and development facilities like the GlaxoSmithKline Harlow Site, The Institute of Cancer Research Sutton Site andthe Eli Lilly Erlwood Research CentreCFS CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 74forging partnerships Study Visits from Regulatory and Scientific Counterparts At the same time, we hosted various familiarisation and study visits by senior officials from our regulatory and scientificcounterparts. As part of our overall approach to forgingpartnerships, we ensured that each visit was an enriching andinformative session for our overseas stakeholders. During the year, some of the overseas stakeholders who visited us were: ZFood and Drug Administration, US ZTherapeutic Goods Administration, Australia ZAssociation of British Pharmaceutical Industries ZLife Sciences/Health Sub-Committee, Singapore-BritishBusiness Council ZPrivate companies like Merlion Pharmaceuticals PL, CSLBioplasma, etc ZInstitute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Public Security, ThePeople 's Republic of China ZCentral Institute for Forensic Medicine, Vietnam ZWestern Pacific Regional Office, World Health Organisation ZDifferent ministries from the health and justice sectors of the regional countries The Year Ahead In the pipeline, we will co-host the 1st Asia-Pacific Symposiumof the Network for Advancement of Transfusion Alternatives, aninternational group of world-renowned anaesthetists, intensivecare specialists, surgeons and transfusion medicine specialistsconcerned with blood conservation techniques.Looking ahead, the exponential increase in scientific development and regulatory issues necessitates continuous professionalrepresentation, participation and exposure so as to foster networksand exchange and build knowledge. The cumulative outcomewill be a stronger team of high-calibre experts who keep in touchwith the network and development of their specialised expertiseto deliver our public mission effectively and efficiently. COLLABORATING WITH LOCAL INDUSTRY AND STAKEHOLDERS Leveraging on local stakeholders from the different public agencies and the industry helps to extend our work and mission.During the year in review, some of the key partnerships withlocal stakeholders were: ZAgri-Food & Veterinary Authority Our CPA formed a work group in January 2003 with representationfrom the Food Control Division, Agri-Food & Veterinary Authorityto address issues pertaining to product classification of \"grey area\" food products, which might be fortified with herbal ingredients. ZSingapore Traditional Chinese Medicine Organisations Committee Aimed at upgrading the standards of Chinese medicinal material dispensers in Singapore, a new training course for these dispenserswas organised by the Singapore Traditional Chinese MedicineCFS CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 75forging partnerships Organisations Committee with the support of and facilitation by HSA and the Ministry of Health. Visiting experts from theprestigious Beijing University of Chinese Medicine were invitedby the Ministry to assist in designing the course 's syllabus. There was an overwhelming response of more than 400 applicants whenthe course began in July 2002. ZCentral Narcotics Bureau During the year, our Narcotics II Laboratory in CFS worked togetherwith the Central Narcotics Bureau on a project to detect thepresence of opiates in hair. The results of the project, which was completed in October 2002, showed that 6-monoacetylmorphineand codeine could be detected in hair samples of opiate abusers.A pilot study was further initiated to look into the feasibility ofusing hair testing in drug monitoring. ZSingapore Police Force Our CFS collaborated with the Singapore Police Force to set upa new DNA Database Laboratory with dedicated DNA profilingfacilities. The new laboratory was launched in February 2003. ZSingapore Science Centre As part of our corporate citizenship programme, we collaboratedwith the Singapore Science Centre on the \"Excellence in Applying Science \" programme. The programme serves to demonstrate, enhance the awareness and learning of the student populationand the community on how we excel in applying science in thefields of forensic science and forensic medicine. The Year Ahead As in every strategic partnership, collaboration with our localstakeholders helps to improve our systems and enable us tobetter meet the needs of our customers. In the year ahead, wewill continue our commitment to forge stronger bonds with CFM CFS CTMmaking connections Z An organisation that can - keep up with the rapid changes in the industries that it regulates,continue to value-add to the essential services it provides toits stakeholders in the administration of justice, and apply thelatest state-of-the-art technology to protect the national bloodsupply - requires a very special work culture to foster commongoals and connectivity within its workforce, with its industrystakeholders, and with the public, the ultimate beneficiary ofits work and mission. \"We drive innovation through a simple mantra \"I Don't know\" . Innovation happens when we inspire our people to do more than they think they can and know. Don't fear failure - we never give up. We know our stakeholders and operating environment and are connected with one and all.\" Lim Peck Seah Assistant DirectorOffice for Innovation and EnterpriseCreating Possibilities Managing Risk Developing Capabilities Exploiting Information Technology Serving with a Difference Caring for Our Communitymaking connections CREATING POSSIBILITIES In an operating environment that is becoming more sophisticated each day, one of our key success factors isto be able to develop a culture of innovation and enterpriseto drive workforce behaviour and performance so thatHSA can deliver its mission to protect public health andsafety. Faced with the challenges of technology andbiomedical innovation, globalisation, emerging diseases,threats of more advanced and large-scale criminal activitiesincluding technology for drug counterfeiting, it isimperative that our workforce, systems and processeshave the capability and robustness to confront thesecritical challenges. Innovation Framework We encourage a vibrant innovative and research culturethrough three guiding principles, focus on vision, freedom with responsibility and frontier - boldly going forward to create and promote growth of intellectual properties thatare protected and optimised through our innovationmanagement framework. Our innovation framework isbuilt upon our vision, mission and core values to harnesscreativity through various strategies like risk managementand value management, thereby generating a self-propagating and self-sustaining pool of innovation thatwill sustain our journey towards excellence.CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFM health Innovation Framework POOL OF INNOVATIONRESEARCH SSS WITSRETURNS FUNDSTAFF TRAINING VMV ALIGNMENT ST@HSACORPORATE EXCELLENCE MODELS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE VISION, MISSION , VALUESIN2VENT OFFICE FOCUS ON VISION FREEDOM WITH RESPONSIBILITY FRONTIER - BOLDLY GOING FORWARDhealth sciences authority 80FISH! Philosophy The year saw a tremendous evolution of our work culture in adopting the FISH! Philosophy. The FISH! Philosophy is a toolto create an innovative and accountable work environment wherea playful, attentive and engaging attitude leads to more energy,enthusiasm, productivity and creativity within the organisation.Bringing the culture across our organisation and to connect theofficers, we held 23 half-day workshops reaching out to 90% ofour officers. Innovation In Action A core team of innovation activists spearheaded and drovevarious innovation initiatives within each centre and department,ensuring the reach to all staff throughout the organisation. Aconstant infusion of culture changing initiatives within anintegrated framework provided a consistent drive based on ourthree guiding principles. During the year, 5 of our Work Innovation Teams (WITs) were selected for presentation at the National QCC level. The teamsreturned with one gold, one silver and three bronze awards. Our Staff Suggestion Scheme continued to tap on staff creativity and operational knowledge to refine the work systems, processesand environment. During the year, 509 out of 1,965 staffsuggestions were accepted for implementation. In addition, theIDEAS Forum was organised to motivate and reward staff innovationand creativity. Research and Development Our efforts in research and development, based on the guidingprinciples in our innovation framework, focused on projects thatserved to enhance the delivery of our mission. From a number of research and development projects during the year, 39 papers were presented in international, regional andlocal professional conferences, 11 papers were published in keyprofessional journals, and one patent was filed. making connections CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 81The patent, the second filed by our organisation, involves the extraction of bioactive components from materials such as botanicalsamples and herbal preparations using pressurised hot water asa solvent at temperatures below 100 degrees Celsius. The methodutilises less energy than sub-critical water extraction methodsand may be used under dynamic flow conditions with or withoutan organic solvent. In addition, a new research and development unit was set up within our CAS as a strategic move to advance the Centre 's journey to be a world class laboratory for analytical testing. We held our 1st Science@HSA Scientific Seminar in April 2002, focusing on \"Health Sciences Research: Priorities and Opportunities \". Our officers presented 24 papers and one poster covering a range of topics in biomedical science, forensic scienceand analytical and radiation science. The proceedings of theseminar were subsequently published. MANAGING RISK Risks abound in the community and in the world of regulatoryand scientific activities. Too much regulation stifles enterpriseand progress but too little regulation exposes the community tounnecessary hazards. Too cautious a scientific approach is resource-consuming without effectiveness but too little attention to scientific methodology undermines confidence and objectivity. In managing risk within HSA, an enterprise-wide risk management study was carried out to assess and develop our capabilityfor business continuity, emergency preparedness and crisismanagement. The exercise was the first step in assessing external and internal risk exposure of our organisation, and would eventually lead toa balanced approach towards risk management. This exerciseserved to create a high level of awareness on the high-riskbusiness our organisation dealt with on a day-to-day basis. Italso established a common platform connecting the minds of ourkey managers in managing risks in their different areas of work. Plans are being reviewed to increase business operational resilience arising from sudden disruptions to operational routines. Emergency Preparedness We sent two representatives to attend the National DisasterMedical System Conference 2003 in the US for familiarisationwith the strategies and current development in mass disastermanagement. Many of our centres updated their emergencypreparedness plans during the year.making connections CFS CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 82DEVELOPING CAPABILITIES Our continued progression as a world class organisation starts with our commitment to promote excellence among our people.In addition to fostering an innovative and enterprising culture,and one with our fingers on the pulse of the high-risk businesswe do, we nurture our people to ensure they have the skills,knowledge and motivation to advance our mission in the yearsto come.People Developer Standards In December 2002, we were recognised with the award of thePeople Developer Standards. By applying this organisationalexcellence tool in a sustained and systematical approach, weensure a continuous learning organisation and people. Training and Development Through the year, we continued to place ongoing efforts andemphasis on building up our officers ' capabilities, knowledge and professionalism. In August 2002, we introduced the ProfessionalDevelopment Programme to give our officers the opportunity toengage in distance learning. Upon attainment of the relevantqualifications, the officers could be emplaced to the respectiveschemes of service. The programme allowed for them to upgradetheir knowledge and competencies and pursue a wider range ofpotential career paths. During the year, 6 officers signed up forthe programme. This programme was supplemented by regular lectures, workshops and seminars co nducted by local and international specialists of the various disciplines relevant to our professional staff. Ourprofessional staff also made presentations to their peers onscientific issues and development in their areas of work as partof knowledge management. Besides, promising officers were sentfor overseas trainings, attachments and study visits to benchmarkregulatory and scientific counterparts.making connections CFS CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 83Scholarship Awards To proactively recruit new talents who will be entering the job market, we offer scholarship awards to \"A\" level high achievers. During the year, one undergraduate scholarship was awarded forthe pursuit of a science bachelor 's degree at the National University of Singapore. EXPLOITING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY The appropriate deployment of technology is one means towardsenhancing our service delivery. With the approval of our three-year Information Technology (IT) Master Plan in July 2002, weswiftly launched into streamlining the operations of our centresso as to achieve greater operational efficiencies. In the past,there were various manual processes that would be automated.Now, we not only leverage on IT as an enabler for fostering betterconnectivity with our stakeholders, but also exploit IT as astrategic tool for realising our public mission.We are on track in the development of a one-stop centre with supporting new modern systems that service various target groupsin the industries that we regulate and the population that weserve. These systems harness the power of the internet to allowus to better administer our regulatory frameworks and the integralprocesses, as well as offer a comprehensive suite of e-servicesto the public. The organisation-wide network infrastructure was upgraded in November 2002 in areas like bandwidth, firewall, print and fileservers so as to support the new complex IT systems. By March2003, the infrastructure was able to support a virtual privatenetwork to improve officers ' mobility and connectivity as part of our business continuity plan and readiness in emergency andcrisis planning. More modules in our human resource and financialinformation systems were also operational in the year. Within the one-stop centre hosting platform are common services, such as client registration and identification service, secureelectronic payment, short messaging services alerts and enquiries,which reduce duplications in the more complex systems thattarget the larger groups of different industry players. Lesscomplex systems such as the Contact Lens Licensing System(collins) and the System for Transfusion Medicine Analysis andManagement (stream) are also developed for greater operationalefficiency and effectiveness. making connections CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 84prism@hsa The Pharmaceutical Registration and Information System (prism@hsa) targets to provide an integrated licensing systemto different industry players dealing in western drugs, Chineseproprietary medicines, health supplements, cosmetics and tobacco.With the system, the industry stakeholders can check and tracktheir application status and make enquiry online. The first phasewas rolled out in March 2003, allowing the stakeholders dealingwith cosmetic products to apply for new import and productlicenses online. medics@hsa The Medical Device Licensing and Control System (medics@hsa)targets to facilitate electronic document submission for medicaldevice registration, electronic billing and payment and informationsearch and retrieval. Its first phase, which was successfullycompleted during the year, comprised product licensing portalsto enable medical device companies to submit electronicapplications for establishment registration and list medical deviceproducts with marketing clearance on the medical device register. DonorCare@HSA The objective of DonorCare@HSA, a blood donor care managementsystem, is to provide an easy, convenient, accessible and user-friendly interface with the altruistic and committed donors witha busy lifestyle. DonorCare@HSA includes an appointmentmanagement system for donors to book blood donationappointments online, and an e-service for blood donors to updatetheir particulars and receive the latest information from the Bloodbank@HSA. Its first phase was successfully rolled out inMarch 2003. SERVING WITH A DIFFERENCE We serve the needs of a broad spectrum of people. Our customersalso include members of the public who donate the gift of lifeat our Bloodbank@HSA and grief-stricken next-of-kin who undergoadministrative procedures for their beloved at our Mortuary@HSA. Apheresis Suite@HSA As part of our continuing efforts to excel in quality donor careand make blood donation a pleasant experience for the donors,we expanded our apheresis service via the new and fully dedicatedApheresis Suite@HSA, located within our Bloodbank@HSA. CAS CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 85Unlike regular whole blood donation where it takes only 20 minutes to complete the donation process, apheresis donationscan range from 45 minutes to two hours. Each apheresis donorcan now enjoy his personal choice of the latest movies and fullterrestrial networks via the individual TV monitor attached toeach apheresis donation couch. In addition, the new ApheresisSuite provides a more comfortable and relaxed environment forits regular donors who make frequent donations of up to 6 timesa year and sacrifice more time at each donation. The expansion of the apheresis service via its fully dedicated service centre is part of our ongoing efforts to encourage voluntaryblood donations through creating an environment that is consonantwith the current expectations and lifestyle. Mortuary@HSA The public waiting area at the reception of our Mortuary@HSAfor the next-of-kin was extensively renovated to provide a clean,comfortable, well-lit and pleasant area, promoting an environmentalsense of calmness and serenity at a time of distress. We havealso created an interview room to allow for meetings with thenext-of-kin in privacy. Counter officers were also sent for enhancedcustomer care training. Customers First Customer satisfaction is our priority. A customer satisfactionsurvey was co nducted in June 2002 to track our service performance against customer expectation and to identify service gaps formaking improvements. A total of 1,558 customers participatedin the survey. The survey findings were encouraging, as we attained a mean score of 5.22 out of 7 for service quality, and5.34 out of 7 for customer satisfaction of outcome. Creating value for our customers is a continuous effort to improve our quality service to become a customer-focused organisation.During the year, our Quality Service Committee promoted qualityservice improvement efforts through three key areas: Zthe development and implementation of customer satisfactionsurvey and the evaluation of staff quality awareness Zthe improvement of customer service especially services at thevarious customer service counters Zthe celebration of quality service acts, with awards like theOutstanding Service to Customers Awards and the OutstandingQuality Improvement Award which were presented at our annualdinner-and-dance function to deserving officers including thosebehind the quality improvement projects. making connections CFS CTM CMDR CRP CAS CDE CPA CFMhealth sciences authority 86CARING FOR OUR COMMUNITY Community Involvement We encourage our staff to take an active personal interest in community involvement. A group of our officers, who attendedthe basic training and orientation course for volunteers co nducted by the Ministry of Community Development and Sports, becamebefrienders to the Singapore Boys ' Home and the Toa Payoh Girls ' Home. A team also participated in the annual Great Walk forHumanity organised by the Singapore Red Cross Society. Charity Our people are also active in fund raising and charity work. Atthe annual National Day Observance Ceremony, booths were setup by the Lions Befrienders, the Spastics Children Associationand the Singapore Association for the Visually Handicapped tosell handicrafts to raise funds for their own respective charity.Further, a total donation of $20,000 was made to the CommunityChest at our annual dinner-and-dance function. This sum camefrom various sources including the profit made from the sale offruits to staff at our annual Fruits Day, the registration feescollected from family members of staff at our annual Family Day,and the dollar-for-dollar matching by the organisation for theregistration fees collected from the dinner-and-dance function.The Next Generation We also played our part in moulding the future generation byhosting educational visits for students, especially for secondaryschools and above. These visits were organised as part of theschools ' science awareness programme. At each visit, the students were briefed on our public mission and national role in applyingscience to protect public health and safety. Tours of our forensicand analytical science laboratories were also facilitated. The Year Ahead We exist to serve. We innovate our culture to make a differencein our workforce so that we can always be ready, responsive andrelevant as we confront the new public health and safety challengesof the 21st century.

The maximum credit risk that the Authority is exposed to is represented by the carrying amounts of its financial assets as stat ed in the balance sheet. b) Interest rate risk The Authority has limited exposure to interest rate risk as interest-bearing assets are all short-term. The Authority does not have any interest-bearing liabilities. c) Foreign currency exchange risk The Authority has limited exposure to foreign currency exchange risk as its operations are substantially transacted in Singapor e dollars. d) Liquidity and funding risk The Authority funds its operations through a mix of internal funds and government grants. The Authority reviews regularly its liquidity reserves, comprising of cash flows from its operations and government grants, to ensure sufficient liquidity is maint ained at all times. e) Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities reported in the balance sheet approximate the fair values of those assets and liabilities. 4 ACCUMULATED SURPLUS The accumulated surplus is to be utilised for future capital and operating expenditures of the Authority.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial year ended 31 March 2003 health sciences authority 1105 PRE-RESTRUCTURING FUNDS 2003 2002 $'000 $'000 Balance at beginning of year 390 - Receipt during the year - 1,475 Transferred to deferred capital grants (Note 6) (130) (251) Transferred to income and expenditure statement (14) (834) Balance at end of year 246 390 The pre-restructuring funds were granted by MOH for the expenditures incurred during the establishment of the Authority. 6 DEFERRED CAPITAL GRANTS 2003 2002 $'000 $'000 Balance at beginning of year 232 - Transferred from pre-restructuring funds (Note 5) 130 251 Transferred from grants received in advance - IT Master Plan (Note 12) 3,379 - Transferred to income and expenditure statement to match depreciation of related assets (33) (19) Balance at end of year 3,708 232 7 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents included in the cash flow statement comprise the following: 2003 2002 $'000 $'000 Bank and cash balances 11,729 8,554 Fixed deposits 2,006 - Short-term bank note 6,009 14,568 The short-term bank note is a fixed-rate secured note which bears interest at the rate of 1.08% (2002 : 1.4%) per annum and mat ures on 14 May 2003.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial year ended 31 March 2003 health sciences authority 1118 OTHER RECEIVABLES, DEPOSITS AND PREPAYMENTS 2003 2002 $'000 $'000 (Restated) Government grants receivable from MOH - 13,949 Other receivables from MOH (a)- 313 Other receivables 237 - Deposits 421 - Advances to staff (b)21 17 Prepayments 65 57 744 14,336 (a)This pertained to a deposit account maintained with MOH which was set up for the purpose of the disbursement of salaries to the employees of the Authority during the initial 9 months after the establishment of the Authority.
