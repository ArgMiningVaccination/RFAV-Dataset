Studio provides mats, bolsters and blankets, but feel free to bring whatever helps you get comfortable so you can relax into the experience*** Immerse in the Experience: Join us in celebration of the spring equinox and the coming of the season of abundance and light. We will connect in to the energy of the equinox to activate the spring newness within, then journey through a pranayama, focusing on the breath to draw us into the present moment. Followed by a chant or mantra to quiet the mind, and a guided meditation to melt you into the experience. From there we'll immerse in the vibrations of a sound bath, creating inner space for deep relaxation, which will aid in the release of tension, stress, and stagnant or trapped energy. From within this state of being the the nervous system comes to a neutral place, allowing the body to begin the process of physical repair while the mind, emotions and spirit soothe, re-calibrate and restore. Reiki Offering: Participants will be offered the gentle loving energy of Reiki in our Sound Experience. Reiki is the energy of unconditional love, and when tuned into and directed by a practitioner it can support with health, harmony and healing on a mental, emotional, physical and energetic level. About the instruments: We will immerse in the soothing sounds of Tibetan Singing Bowls that have been hand crafted and blessed by Monks. These bowls are made of the seven metals that represent the seven visible planets, created with the intent to bring us back into harmony with the rhythm of life. We'll tune into the sounds of droning instruments and enter a light trance state as the monotones calm the mind and bring it to quiet. We'll bath in the vibrations of the symphonic gong, which holds the sounds of the solar system, as recorded by NASA, allowing us to transcend the physical. We'll chant to tune our own instruments, our voices and bodies, and calibrate our being to sound codes that support our mental, spiritual, emotional and physical health All this will happen within a soundscape of natural percussion instruments, infused with vibrational medicine. And as we entrain to these sounds we will come into harmony with the vibrations inherent in nature, in the planets, and in the cosmos.
