During the working period, the volunteers were given buttermilk, water or no liquid. Rectal and saliva samples were obtained after and during 3 hours of physical work, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible physiological effects of drinking buttermilk on heat stress by comparing the microbial composition, diversity and quantity of selected bacterial group in terms of different treatments - buttermilk, water and no liquid ingest ion. The stress marker cortisol in saliva samples was measured to assess the stress level. The level of cortisol was also correlated to the gut bacterial flora. Introduction Buttermilk Apart from other traditional methods, such as rest, ventilation and using shade structures, the most widely used method to cope with heat stress in workplaces in India is drinking buttermilk. Buttermilk is a traditional drink in India and other warm climates countries (e.g. Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and is a diluted form of curd (plain yogurt). It is consumed especially during summer as it is soothing to the stomach and alleviates minor stomach upsets. It is also considered to have gastrointestinal benefits as it contains bacteria such as Lactobacillus de lbrueckii, which was the most predominant species identified in the product. The other minor genera ). On the other hand, buttermilk contains a high level of protein, potassium, vitamin B 2 , vitamin B 12 and calcium, which help in providing body with required minerals and vitamins that may be depleted on account of excessive sweat ( Rajendra et al ., 2013 ). Addi tionally, it should be stressed that according the traditional method to make buttermilk in India, a significant amount of spices are usually added, such as green chili, ginger, coriander, curry leaves, asafoetida and mustard. In some studies it is found t hat some spices have pharmacological application against digestive disorders ( Nadkarni, 1976, Atal, 1987 ), for instance, ginger and its derivatives have ability to inhibit enterotoxigenic Escherchia coli diarrhea (Chen et al., 2007). The recipe of the used buttermilk can be found in Appendix 2. Gut microbiota and health Microbiota or microflora, is a particular term for the huge commensal microorganisms that reside external (skin, oral etc.) or internal (gut etc.) human bodies. There is a growing awareness that the gut microbiota is essential for our health, both in physiological and physiopathological point of views. Efforts are now turning to investigate the role of microbiota in psychopathology by using animal models and human trials, and a growing body o f evidence has proved that interaction between microbiome and human bodies is essential for the development of nervous system and regulation of neural functions (Bercik et al ., 2012; Grenham et al., 2011). The brain communicates with the organs, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through several axes: the hypothalamic -pituitary axis and the axis, the HPA axis regulates gut mobility, permeability (John and Timothy, 2012) and cortisol secretion which affects immune cells activity (Montiel -Castro et al ., 2013). Therefore the activation of HPA axis caused by stress response can lead to dysfunctions in the GI tract. Stress not only alters gut microbiota composition but also affect the intestinal barrier by impaired the mucus layer which led to increased gut permeability (Maes et al ., 2012). 5 Stress is a common mood disorder which can be caused by nervous, endocrinal and immunological problem. Stressor might be divided in different categories such as chemical, biological and e nvironmental stimuli. When encounter a stressor, the human body should respond to the challenge which is called stress response. An important component of stress response is regulated by the HPA system which modulates a range of activation, resulting in th e releasing of cortisol (a glucocorticoid hormone) by adrenal cortex (Kozlov and Kozlova, 2014). Then cortisol causes a variety of physiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes that are necessary for the body to adapt the stressor successfully (Sapolsky et al., 2000, Erickson et al., 2003, Schulkin, 2010). Measuring cortisol level is a common way to estimate stress response, especially in the blood serum (Kochetkov et al., 2008, Pikovskaya et al., 1997, Sudsuang et al., 1991, Evolahti et al., 2006 ). How ever, there are some limitations of measuring blood serum cortisol concentration as it is an invasive, especially in epidemiological and psychological studies ( Kozlov and Kozlova, 2014 ). Thus cortisol level in saliva is a commentary technique that enables to give information of hormonal status sufficiently, informatively, taking account that cortisol level in saliva accounts 5% of blood serum cortisol (Guazzo et al., 1996), it still reflects free cortisol level with accuracy (Umeda et al ., 1981). Heat stres s Heat stress is a major issue in workplaces across warm climates countries. Workers who are working outdoors in agriculture, construction, mining, soldiers, and firefighters are often exposed to severe heat stress, which deteriorate the work productivity, efficiency and can threaten survival. When the ambient temperature reaches or exceeds the human core temperature of 38 \u00b0 C, there are well documented physiological effects on the human body, posing risks to some organ systems and also making it progressive ly harder to work productively, especially physically (Bennett and McMichael, 2010). It is also found that heat stress can lead to intestinal barrier dysfunction, induce increased GI tract permeability and likely an inflammatory response (Lambert, 2009). Microbial diversity Microbial diversity is an important indicator of human homeostasis. A relative higher microbial diversity is usually regarded as higher resistibility to ecological disturbances (Yachi and Loreau, 1999). Low microbial diversity, in contra st, is in general related to some gastrointestinal tract diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease (Wang et al., 2007, Dicksved et al., 2008), obesity (Turnbaugh et al., 2009), non -alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Pessayre et al., . 2002) and in infants with atopic eczema (Wang et al., 2007). Thus, studying and measuring bacterial diversity in human gut is a suitable way to investigate the ecological pattern of the microflora communities. In this study, two diversity indices were calculated to estimate the evenness and richness of the gut microbial communities, which is Shannon - Weaver index and Simpson index respectively. The Shannon index ( ) is a n overall diversity index that accounts for both species abundance and evenness, and is more sensitive to change in abundance of rare species (Magurran, 1996, Hughes et al. , 2001). The Simpsons index ( ) is a dominance measure and shows the chance that two subjects selected at random will be from the same species (Hughes et al. , 2001). The Simpson index is usually expressed as 1 - D so the index increases when diversity increases (Magurran, 1996). Material and Methodology Subjects Twelve subjects (20 - 25 yea rs; 6 women, 6 men) were recruited by advertisement. All subjects were normotensive, nonsmokers, and not taking any medicines that might alter the cardiovascular or 6 thermoregulatory responses in heat. All women had a normal menstrual cycle, were not taking oral contraceptives, and were tested in the early follicular phase (days 2 -10). Subjects were all within normal range of BMI 18.5 -25 (Anonymous, 2012). The subject was required to abstain from strenuous exercise for at least 48 hours prior to the test. A standardized breakfast (egg sandwich) was consumed in the morning and about 500ml of water to ensure normal hydration state. On arrival, the subject visited the toilet prior to the test. Methodology The test were performed in the climate lab at the Depar tment of Design Studies (Lund University, Lund). The subject performed medium workload (Table 1), such as loading bricks, stepping and biking, for 3 hours in the hot controlled environment (around 35 degrees, 60% Relative Humidity) with three conditions: dehydrated, water and buttermilk (200 ml room tempered drink every 20 minutes). The three experimental trials were separated by at least one week and were randomized for the cross -over study. Four saliva samples (approximately every 60 minutes during the test and one after the test person had woken up and brushed teeth, before consuming the egg sandwich and water) and one rectal sample of each subject were collected. Saliva samples were obtained by using the \"Salivette Cortisol, code blue\" (Sarstedt, Germa ny) in terms of quick and hygienic sampling (Hellhammer et al., 1987). After the test, the plastic casing around the rectal probe was removed, inserted into a sterile test tube weighted and refrigerated. Both saliva and rectal samples were stored in -80 until analysis. Table 1. Test procedure Time Activities 8:00 -9:00 Subject arrives Saliva sample (note the time the test -person had woken up and brushed teeth). Subject eats a standardized breakfast (egg sandwich and 500ml of water). Visits the toilet, urine sample, rectal sensor inserted. Enters the climate chamber (37 degree Celsius, 60% RH). Start of test Start submaximal work task Every 20min Medium work task is changed. 4 tasks at rotating intervals: - Loading bricks (Metronome 30) - Stepping (Metronome 45) - Biking with legs (75W 60 rph) - Biking with hands (25W 60 rph) Saliva sample Drink provided depending on intervention (200ml, room temperature). 12:00 -End of test Exits the chamber Visits the toilet, plastic casing ar ound the rectal probe is removed, inserted into a test tube weighted and refrigerated. Lunch provided DNA extraction To isolate and purify the DNA from rectal samples, the following procedures in combination with EZ1 Advanced XL (tissue kit and bacteria c ard; Qiagen) were used. Rectal samples were first thawed and weighed. Ten milliliter phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Oxoid, England) buffer was added in order to collect all traces of rectal samples. Vortex for 2 minutes. After centrifuging in the cold roo m (4) at 8000 rpm for 7 10 minutes, 500 l PBS was added to the pellet. Twelve sterile and UV - treated glass beads (2 mm in diameter) were added into 1.5 ml tubes containing the sample. After incubating in room temperature for 10 minutes, the tubes with gla ss beads were shaken in an Eppendorf Mixer (Model 5432; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 4 for 45 minutes. After the samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 3000 rpm, 200 l supernatant was added to sample tube which was then extracted with the EZ1 Adva nced XL. PBS without sample was treated in parallel as a negative control of DNA extraction. Finally, 22 l sterile 10 x TE-buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) was added to elution tubes. Polymerase Chain Reaction The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a specific and exponential synthesis of desired DNA region by using two specifically designed primers or oligonucleotides which are complementary to a part of the target DNA (Elizabeth et al ., 200 8). In this study, de generative primers were used to amplify 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) genes which is highly conserved region between different bacteria species (Coenye and Vandamme, 2003). Inosine (I) in degenerative primers enable the possibility to pair with adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) or guanine (G) which increase the annealing efficiency (Watanabe et al., 2001). In this with -27 base pair respecti vely in E. coli (Brosius et al., 1978), were used in non-fluorescently -labeled PCR in order to ensure the results of former DNA extraction and also to decide the volume of EB buffer in the following purification procedure. Cycling parameters in an Eppendor f Mastercycler (Hamburg, Germany) were as follows: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0 C for 3 min followed by 32 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0 C for 1 min, 50 \u00b0 C for 45 s, extension 72\u00b0 C for 2 min and final extension 72\u00b0 C for 7 min. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis PCR products electrophoresed gel in TB (Tris - Borate) buffer containing 168 l of 3 fold GelRed Nucleic Acid staining solution at 100 V for 60 min and visualized under UV light. Two microliter GelPilot 100 base pair Plus Ladder (QIAGEN Group, Germany) was used as marker. Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism As its name implies, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T -RFLP) analysis measures the size polymorphism of terminal r estriction fragments from a PCR amplified marker. It is a combination of DNA amplification, restriction endonucleases digestion and nucleic acid electrophoresis (Terence L Marsh, 1999). This tool allows the possibility of rapid analysis complex microbial c ommunities as terminal restriction fragment (T -RFs) profiles and it has been often used to characterize human gut microflora (Hayashi H., et al ., 2002; Wang M et al. , 2008; Karlsson J. et al. , 2011). Fluorescently -labeled PCR The 16S rRNA genes wer e amplified from samples using a fluorescently -labeled forward primer (FAM - ENV1) and the FAM) at th e 5' end. Each PCR reaction had a volume of 25 l including, 2.5 l of 10x PCR buffer (containing 15mM MgCI 2), 0.2 mM each primer: FAM -ENV1 and DNA polymerase ( Qiagen , Germany) and DNA template. The cycling parameters were same as described before. Purification, DNA concentration measurement and Digestion Products from fluorescently - labeled PCR reactions were pooled, purified and concentrated by MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen , Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA was 8 eluted in different volume of EB buffer (20l, 25l or 30l) corresponding to the agarose gel electrophoresis results. The concentrations of purified DNA were measured by using Nanod rop ND - 1000 spectrophotometer (Saveen Werner, Sweden). Then the purified DNA were subjected to restriction enzyme digestion with enzymes that have 4 base pair recognition site. In this study, Msp I (HpaII) which recognizes C^CGG sites was used (Thermo Scie ntific, Germany). Purified PCR products were digested for 5h at 37 \u00b0 C by 10 U of restriction endonuclease Msp I, in a total volume of 10 l. Then the enzymes were inactivated at 65 \u00b0C for 15 min. The digestion step generated fluorescently -labeled terminal r estriction fragments. The digested amplicons were analyzed on an ABI 3130xl Genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA) with internal size standard GeneScan LIZ 600 (range 20 -600 bases) at DNA - lab (Malm\u00f6, Sweden). The output was analyze d by GeneMapper software version 4.1 (Applied Biosystems). T -RFs were resolved between 40 - 580 base pairs considering background noise and accuracy. Peak detection thresholds were set as Blue and orange 40 FU, while for other dye colors were default thresholds which were 50 FU. Quantitative PCR Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillus were selected bacterial groups quantified by using quantitative PCR methodology. Quantitative, or real time, PCR (qPCR) is standard PCR with the advantage of detecting the amount of DNA formed after each cycle with either fluorescent dyes or fluorescently -tagged oligonucleotide probes (Higuchi R et al ., 1992). qPCR results can be obtained faster and with less variability than standard PCR due to sensitive fluorescent chemistr y and elimination of post -PCR detection procedures. The intensity of the fluorescence emitted during qPCR correlates to the amount of DNA product formed (Wong M.L et al ., 2005). Preparation of standard curve for qPCR Ten microliter of selected bacteria groups, Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillus, were cultured in 10 ml Luria -Bertania (LB) broth with 20 50 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 incubation for maximum 16 hours. The bacteria cultures were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 3 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The plasmid DNA were purified according to the manufacturer instruction (Qiagen). The concentrations of the purified plasmid DNA were measured by NanoDrop and used to calculate 16S rRNA gene copies/\u00b5l purified DNA of each bacteria group according to the following formula: 239 10 6.023649 fragments) amplified PCR 3000(10.] [/ bpconcl copies As for standard curves, Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillus were used. Ten -fold dilution series of purified plasmid DNA were made in elution buffer (EB). For all qPCR assays, each reaction l 2\u00d7 Rotor -Gene SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen), 1 L of each primer (Table 2), 2 l of template DNA, and RNase -free water to the final volume of 20 l. Samples, standards, and non -template controls were run in triplicate. The thermal c ycling was performed in Rotor -Gene Q (Qiagen) with a program of 95\u00b0 C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles with denaturation at 95\u00b0 C for 5 s, annealing, and elongation at 60\u00b0 C for 10 and 20 s (Table 2). The fluorescent products were detected at the last step of each cycle. Melting curve analysis was made to ensure specific amplification. Absolute abundance of copy number was calculated based on standard curves using Rotor -Gene Q Series Software 1.7 (Qiagen). Number of bacteria was expressed as numbers of 16S rRN A gene copies /g weight of rectal samples. 9 Table 2.

The sample -antigen -antibody complexes were detected by an electro -chemical reaction which resulted in the emission of light (electrochemiluminescence) whose intensities were measured. The light intensity was inversely proportional to the concentration of cortisol in the sample. ( Wild D., 2005) In order to observe the effects of drinking buttermilk, water or dehydration on free cortisol level, a table of normal level of salivary cortisol concentration for approximately 700 adults over 4 time periods is included (Table 3). Table 3. The normal level of salivary cortisol concentration (m eans\u00b1 SD): Time 14.6\u00b1 5.853 11:00 10.12\u00b1 5.332 Revised from Kirschbaum et al., 1994 and Kirschbaum et al ., 2000 Statistical Analysis and calculation The relative abundance of each terminal restriction fragment (T -RFs) was calculated as the peak area of a certain T -RF divided by the total peak area of all T -RFs in the given T -RFLP pattern with fragment length detection limit of 40 to 580 base pair. The relative abundance which is in the following formula, was used for calculation of Shannon and Simpson diversity indices ( Magurran and Anne, 2013 ): The differences in microbial diversity among buttermilk, water and dehydrated treatments group were tested by using Kruskal -Wallis rank sum test. The qPCR data -Damico -Wolfe -Dunn test (NDWD) for pairwise comparisons using package \"coin\" in the R program. 10 The copy number of the 16S rRNA gene per gram of rectal samples were calculated as follows: )2)200/D) samples/D rectal oft q/(((weigh sample rectal gramper numbers copy 2 1 l Where q is the detected copy numbers from 2 l of diluted template, D 1 and D 2 are the dilution factor which were 500 l and 200 l respectively, 200 l was the volume of the elution of DNA extraction. When it comes to cortisol data, 1 - way ANOVA was used to determine significant effects among the four time points of three treatments. Likewise, significant differences between female and male subjects of four time points were also tested using 1 - way ANOVA. Correlation an d linear regression was used to test the relation between cortisol level and Enterobacteriaceae population. For all univariate statistical evaluations, a P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Multivariate data analysis was performed using SIMCA -P + 12.0 (Umetrics, Ume\u00e5, Sweden) to reveal differences between the treatment group. RESULTS Diversity indices No significant difference ( P >.05) was observed in the Shannon or Simpson index of rectal microbiota between the three treatments groups (Table 4 and Fig. 1). As the plots shown, the diversity indices of water treatment group were more centered compared to buttermilk and dehydrated groups, which indicate the water tre atment had less influence on subjects' microbiota diversity. Table 4 Microbial diversity indices in rectal content of the three treatments groups; buttermilk, dehydrated and water Buttermilk Dehydrated Water Shannon Simpson Shannon Simpson Shannon Simpson expressed median values and interquartile ranges, for Shannon index, P= .99 and for Simpson index, P= 1. Figure 1 Shannon and Simpson indices after T -RFLP of 16S rRNA with Msp I for digestion, generated from the rectal microbiota of subjects of three treatments group, Buttermilk (B, n=12), Dehydrated (D, n=12) and Water (W , n=12) respectively. * For Water group, oran ge dots were outliers. 11 Number of peaks The median number of peaks after digestion with Msp I were 40, 41 and 43 for Buttermilk, Water and Dehydrated group respectively (Fig. 2). There was no significantly difference among the three treatment (P > .05). Figure 2 Medians number of peaks after T -RFLP of 16S rRNA with Msp I for cutting, generated from the rectal microbiota of three treatments group, buttermilk, and water and dehydrated, respectively. Quantitative PCR Lactobacillus and Enterobacteriaceae were detected with qPCR in 9 and 12 subjects respectively, with the load of 103 to 109 16S rRNA gene copies/ g rectal samples (Table 5). No significant difference ( P > .05) between the 16S rRNA gene copies/ g rectal samples of three treatments. However, highe r values of IQR were found in the Enterobacteriaceae population compared to Lactobacillus group, which suggest that the treatments had bigger influence on the population of Lactobacillus . Table 5 Log 16S rRNA gene copy numbers/g rectal samples of subject harboring the analyzed bacterial taxa from different treatments detected by qPCR (Median, IQR). log 16S rRNA gene copies/g Saliva cortisol level In the present study, the dehydrated group had a relative high saliva cortisol concentration at time point 4 compared with buttermilk and water treatment groups (Table 6). Additionally, the saliva cortisol level of subjects drinking buttermilk and water were all within the normal cortisol level range, while at the last time point the cortisol levels of dehydrated group were above the normal salivary cortisol level (Table 6). Significant differences between the Buttermilk and Dehydrated groups, as well as Water and Dehydrated groups at the last time -point were found ( P = 0.017), but differences among t he other three time points 12 were not significant. The saliva cortisol level of dehydrated treatment group had a fluctuation over 4 hours' time period while the cortisol levels of buttermilk and water treatment subjects showed a smooth decreasing trend as il lustrated in Figure 7.

The data were not significantly ( P > .05) different between male and female of same treatment. However, it can be concluded that at the last time point of the dehydrated group, the female subjects experienced a harder time in terms of high level of cortisol secreted compared with the males ( Fig. 8).

Multivariate data analysis The multivariate data analysis depict a substantial similarity or dissimilarity between different subjects and illustrate the potential relations between variables and observations . In order to have an overview, a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) score scatter plots of T-RFLP matrix was created, it clearly show ed that the same subject of three treatments clustered together according the size of T -RFs (Fig. 9). 14 -10-8-6-4-20246810 (PCA-X) t[Comp. 2015/8/22 13:43:46 Figure 9 PCA score plot (Par scale setting) of sub jects based on the T -RFLP data PCA score scatter plot based on cortisol level, qPCR data, diversity indices as well as peak numbers of T-RFLP profile, were separated clearly in different subjects.

Red box: Cortisol level at time point 2 (right) and 4 (left) . The subjects separated clearly in several groups representing three treatments of same subjects (Fig. 16a). As for the loading plot, a shift in microbiota can be seen from Fig. 16b. Moreover, Cortisol level at time point 4 had a bigger influence on the shifting. DISCUSSION The principal aims of the present study were to examine the latent h eat stress relieving capacity of drinking buttermilk and to observe the human gut microbiota in hot occupational condition. Although no significant differences in diversity indices of three treatment groups were found, we detected, by means of salivary cortisol level analysis, significantly differences between the Buttermilk and Dehydrated groups, as well as Water and Dehydrated groups at the last time -point ( P = 0.017). Additionally, the saliva cortisol level of subjects drinking buttermilk and water were all within the normal range ( Kirschbaum et al., 1994 and Kirschbaum et al ., 2000 ), while at the last time point the cortisol level of the dehydrated group was above the normal salivary cortisol level. An increase in cortisol is usually thought to be indicative of stress (Evans et al., 1994). However, there are three identified main characteristics of a stressor that determine the stress response, i.e., a stress or must be perceived as a new, and/or unexpected, and/or uncontrollable by the person (Mason, 1968). In this case, the experiment setting of stressor might not conform to these three characteristics. Thus, it could be a reason that the salivary cortisol pr ofiles did not differ much among three treatments. When it comes to the qPCR data, Lactobacillus and Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 9 (75%) and 12 (100%) subjects , with the medians 7.64 (Water) log 16S rRNA gene copies/g rectal samples respectively . No significant difference in Lactobacillus or Enterobacteriaceae load of three treatments could be found. Due to limited time and project budget, only two bacterial groups were tested with qPCR analysis. However, higher IQR vales were found in Enterobacteriaceae population, which may indicate the treatments had larger infl uence on the population of Enterobacteriaceae group. From the correlation and linear regression test, no relation between the cortisol profile and Enterobacteriaceae population was found. The PCA score and scatter plots indicated that the microbiota differed widely between individuals with regard to both composition and diversity . While the PLS score and loading scatter plots based on cortisol, core temperature and T -RFLP data explicated that the observations separated in groups which representing three treatments of same subject. However, the relationship between the stress indicators (core temperature and salivary cortisol level) and the gut microbial diversity was not clearly shown. As the PCA -0.10.00.10.20.3 -0.2 -0.1 -0.0 0.1 0.2 SIMCA-P 11.5 - 2015/8/22 10:40:11 18 and PLS models shown, the results clustered together mos tly according subjects, which may indicate the gut microbiota itself differs from man to man. Inheritance and diet are in the long run the two most important factors for influencing the composition the gut microbiota of an individual. When the bacterial composition of 106 faecal samples, from 60 different mammalians (including humans) was compared, it was concluded that both the diet and phylogeny influenced the bacterial diversity (Ley et al. 2008). It also should be stressed that, the order of three tre atments were randomly decided. Thus, it might be difficult to observe the microbiota diversity, as well as the cortisol level differences, if buttermilk has certain effects on soothing the heat stress condition. Moreover , due to the subjects had different schedules, the second or third test of some subjects took several months after the first test was done. Hardly surprisingly, diet was reported to be the key spark for the development of intestinal microbiota structure (Yatsunenko T et al., 2012 ). Researchers have found that long -term dietary patterns largely determine the main phyla of the gut microbial profile (Moschen AR et al. , 2012). On the other hand, administration of singular or small groups of select beneficial microbes although may not h ave a major impact on stable phyla, for example, a single strain of Lactobacillus , one that might be carried with traditional foods, may improve overall microbial diversity (Karlsson C et al. , 2010). The administration of a single Bifidobacterium strain, o ne among a genera commonly found in fermented dairy products, can increase the intestinal quantity of completely separate Bifidobacterium species, and Lactobacilli overall (Lahtinen SJ et al. , 2009; Ahmed M et al., 2007). Thus, in this study, dietary patte rn was an important factor that may affect the diversity indices. Likewise, when it comes to cortisol profile, time after wak ening is an important factor that may gave a different test result. Generally, the peak concentration is reached within 45 min in healthy subjects who wake up early (from 4:55 to 8:03 UT) and within 30 min in subjects who wake up later (from 8:24 to 12:03 UT) (Udielka and Kirschbaum, 2003). Then the cortisol concentration starts to decrease, decreasing slower in those who woke up ear ly (Edwards S. et al ., 2001). Although in this study, most of the subjects had the first salivary cortisol test at least one hour after they woke up (except one subject, S6, which was 40 minutes after waking), they still had different waking time that may have an influence of their cortisol profile, not to mention some of the subjects woke up very early to make it on time, which might stress the subjec t and give another cortisol profile. Overall, the study although did not give significant results of most analyses with exception of the last time point salivary cortisol level data. However, from this study we gained a lot of practical experiences about dealing with human rectal and saliva samples in order to get an overview of the relation between gut microbiota and cortisol profile. In one word, it was a very complex study since a lot of environmental factors and personal factors need to be considered , on the other hand, the study gave us a lot of practical experience and thinking taking account of future perspectives. 19 References Ahmed M, Prasad J, Gill H, Stevenson L, Gopal P . \"Impact of consumption of different levels of Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 on the intestinal microflora of elderly J Nutr Health Aging (2007): 11:26-31.
