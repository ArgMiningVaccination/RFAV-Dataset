Being part of this organization helped us to get quickly educated on issues at the local, state and federal levels. Often it is not easy to tackle public policy issues as a single company, but with the chamber of commerce one will have a much stronger voice. Further the chamber provided us a roadmap to promote our business in the community with an ROI to was tenfold in just 2 years with our robust engagement. Lastly the most valuable proposition that the chamber of commerce offers to its members is leadership. It has opened the doors for us to participate in committees, councils and even the Board of Directors. We are grateful to the Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce.\" Maria Medina Minuteman Press Wilton Manors \"I joined the Chamber in 2015 at the general membership level, but after seeing my ROI in 2017 I quickly upgraded to Trustee. I am very happy with my level of membership at the Chamber and feel it gives me that little bit extra with Trustee-only events during which I meet key business professionals. I would highly recommend joining the Chamber. It has done a lot for my business and can for your,s too! If you can't afford Trustee level, join at general membership. You will see how the business generated by the Chamber will allow you to upgrade in no time!\" Oren Kiriat Be Well Med Spa \"Wow! This is what comes to mind when I think of The Chamber. For our business it's just a total wow factor. A little more than one year ago we opened our business and were advised to join the chamber and so we did and have been inundated with so many great opportunities to network, develop relationships, promote and so much more. We always look forward to events at the chamber and recently have been able to participate more and give back and we look forward to more great things to come with The Chamber.\" Lynn Goldman Broward Technical Colleges (Atlantic, McFatter & Sheridan) \"The Greater Ft. Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce has proven to be invaluable for the vast amount of resources it offers. Making connections to expand awareness of Atlantic, McFatter & Sheridan Technical Colleges/Technical High Schools, develop business and personal relationships, increased presence in the community and the opportunity to meet with and work with extraordinary community leaders has proven to be a worthwhile investment.\" Graciela Valdes Valdes Fine Art Photography \"Joining a Chamber of Commerce and getting on the Directory will NOT help your business. However, GETTING INVOLVED will take your business to the NEXT LEVEL! I've been part of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber since 2015 and the return on investment has been exponential! There are a multitude of ways to get involved and you have to choose the one that speaks to you. Being a part of a Leads Group has been the single biggest boost to my business, out-performing every other method of traditional marketing I've tried. Dedicate yourself to developing relationships, referring business to others and giving back to your community and everything else will fall into place. It has for me!\" Nicole Vernon Blade Title Company \"I joined the Chamber and initially started with networking events. It was recommended that I join a leads group and I hit the jackpot when I joined the Lunch Bunch Leads Group! It has been instrumental in our business growth but I have also developed many personal relationships with fellow Chamber members. We genuinely care about each other and our successes. It's more than a leads group- it's a community!\" Representative Chip LaMarca Member of Florida House of Representatives \"Having worked closely with the Chamber during the entire time that I have served on the County Commission, I can say that they have been a tremendous resource in accomplishing major milestones for our community. Working together and participating in the Chamber Fly-Ins, we have accomplished projects like the long-awaited Segment II Beach Renourishment Project and we have been given the necessary approvals to officially start the preconstruction and design work necessary to embark on the Port Everglades Expansion Project through the deepening and widening of the channels for new trade and cruise business.\" Mark Budwig S Mark Graphics \"I met Elise Boston, Holt Communications, in September 2008 at the Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce Small Business Committee. We got to know each other and became strategic partners - she gave us a few projects and we retained her firm for a few projects. In 2014, Elise went to work for the City of Tamarac as Public Information Officer. Elise contacted me to provide a proposal for the City's quarterly 24-page newsletter \"Tamagram.\" S.MARK Graphics was retained for the project. Now in our fourth year of producing the newsletter, it all started with a Chamber member to member relationship. Multiply this by over 1200 Chamber members and you'll understand the Chamber's tag line: Experience. Better. Business. Michal Kitai, ARNP Be Well Med Spa \"Love it! The Chamber is an excellent place to network and develop great relationships and gain visibility. I really love the wide range of events they host and all of the opportunities. The people and the organization are first class!\" Jean McIntyre iBERIABANK The Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber Trustee program offers dynamic relevant lunch topics, networking and engagement opportunities with community leaders both business and civic in an atmosphere that is symbiotic for growth and development. It is truly a place of business for business and IBERIABANK is proud to be an active participate in this vital organization.\" Karen Prescod Prescod Life & Health At Prescod Life & Health we exist to listen, educate, support and advocate. We believe in empowerment. Joining the Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce was an extension of the very core of who I am, and why PLH exists. I joined a little over three years ago, in an effort to align with other entrepreneurs, business and community leaders. I believed that connecting with others would allow me to get acquainted with Fort Lauderdale, add value to this community, as well as grow my business. In addition to achieving those goals, I had the immense fortune to establish great relationships, which have developed into a network that has become an invaluable resource. As a person who is committed to community and giving back, I have been able to participate on different committees, work on numerous community engagement projects, and spearhead several councils and committees along the way. Becoming a GFLCC member is something that I would encourage businesses of any size to explore. Even more than becoming a member, I would encourage businesses to get involved and be actively engaged to achieve the maximum return on your investment.\" Susan Reardon Galante So Flo Well Body \"I relocated from Boston, Massachusetts last October and launched So Flo Well Body in early February. In my field, knowing my community, 'word of mouth' and referrals are the biggest means in which to grow my practice. Never belonging to a Chamber prior to living in FTL, I was very green in terms of how things worked and what the Chamber and can do to help you grow. Jenny deBorja, has been so helpful and amazing in showing me the ropes! The Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce hosts wonderful events that have allowed me to get to know my new community members better and to create brand recognition.\" Christopher Johnson Kingston Asset Management Services, Inc. \"The membership of Kingston Asset Management in the Ft Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce has been instrumental in enhancing and strengthening our networking capabilities. The frequent and diverse events and activities hosted by the Chamber have provided new lead opportunities that have attracted new businesses in need of the debt recovery services offered by Kingston Asset Management Services, Inc. The personalized attention of the Chamber's Executives, particularly the Membership Services Team, has been tremendous.

The networking is incredibly valuable and is a great platform for small business owners. The Chamber allows us to meet new business contacts, exchange ideas and enhance our brand with others in the local community. We continuously look forward to what the future brings and love the relationships we have built and the new ones we have yet to create!\" Sarah J.
