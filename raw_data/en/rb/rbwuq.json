PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. Executive Summary of the Project: The purpose of this BRIEF executive summary is to convey to the reader a holistic understanding of the proposed project: what it is, why you need to do it, and what it will cost. A one-page response will suffice. Please include: (1) Brief Description of the project-what the applicant proposes to do (2) Rationale for the project -the need and/or business case for the proposed project (3) Cost -the total cost of implementing the proposed project 1) Alpas Wellness La Plata (\"Alpas\" or the \"Applicant\") proposes to establish 36 adult Intermediate Care Facility beds within a 108 bed residential behavioral health treatment facility, planned to be licensed by the Behavioral Health Administration and accredited by The Joint Commission. The project will feature six distinct units providing targeted interventions for: substance use disorders, process disorders to include gambling and sex addiction, and eating disorders. 36 beds ( 18 Level 3. 7 detoxification beds and 18 Level 3. 7 medically managed beds) are subject to a Certificate of Need Review. The remaining 72 beds fall under Behavioral Health Administration's oversight. 2) Thousands of residents in the MarylandNirginia/DC region struggle with behavioral health concerns. Maryland's overdose numbers continue to rise, nearing 2800 for the year 2020 (see Exhibit 3) The existing network of treatment providers in Maryland has insufficient capacity to provide the unique targeted interventions necessary to stem the tide of substance use and related overdose deaths in the region. Alpas's primary emphasis is on mind-body healing through the unification of holistic, evidence-based, and alternative treatment approaches. This integrative style empowers a person to mend their whole being. We collaborate with the client and their families to design targeted and personalized care programs. Each program is tailored to identify and meet every client's and family's unique needs. Our program helps clients develop simple tools to utilize in their daily lives. These tools are proven vital to maintaining a healthy, and sober life once the client returns home. Through this blend of interventions and the project's focus on research into how environment of care can improve upon healing and overall recovery, the facility present a unique opportunity for those struggling with behavioral health concerns to experience a level of intervention not typically seen at the in-network level. 3) Alpas is prepared to devote significant financial and clinical resources to the project, not only through the provision of treatment interventions, but through continued education and support to our surrounding communities. The project has secured $42,637,500 in private funding, via a traditional draw down loan through Colliers that functions similarly to a line of credit, to develop and operate the facility as a world-class leader in the innovative treatment of behavioral health disorders. See Exhibit 12. The private nature of Alpas' funding represents a significant gain to the State of Maryland and its efforts to fight the current substance use crisis. The cost allocated to the CON-regulated portion of the oroiect is $2.4 million. 4 B. Comprehensive Project Description: The description should include details regarding: (1) Construction, renovation, and demolition plans The site consists of approximately 4.8 acres fronting Washington Avenue in La Plata in Charles County, Maryland. The building consists of a single building with three stories above grade, and one below grade level totaling 58,904 square feet. The building is new construction, completion in 2020. The building was constructed by a prior owner to be an assisted living facility. Given the building's original intended purpose to serve the Assisted Living community, the interior provides insufficient working space for a behavioral health treatment center. Interior renovations and an attached addition are needed to more properly meet the needs of individuals with behavioral health concerns. As constructed, the building offers six distinct units, each housing 18 beds. The 108 beds within will serve separate and distinct populations as follows: 18 beds for 3. 7 detoxification, 18 beds for 3.7 medically managed, 36 beds residential levels of care 3.1/3.3/3.5, 18 beds for process disorders including gambling and sex addiction, 18 beds for eating disorders. Construction/Renovation/Demolition is planned across 2 phases and this construction is necessitated by the planned 3.1 /3.3/3.5 levels of care. The 6 units will be functionally identical in outfitting distinct nurse's stations, common areas, and resident rooms following the completion of the renovation project. With this in mind, the proposed 3. 7 units located on the ground floor will require the same renovations and updates as the units planned to house 3.1/3.3/3.5 levels of care. Renovation costs of approximately $2.4 million have been allocated to the 3.7 level of care as proposed. These renovations are currently in process given that the project and facility are able to pivot and will utilize the proposed 3. 7 units for lower levels of residential care while pursuing 3. 7 certificate of need approval. Phase I involves interior demolition and retrofitting that will provide sufficient office, group and community spaces for residential level of care 3.1/3.3/3.5. Demolition for Phase I commenced June 2022 and the planned renovations as approved by the Township of La Plata were completed on October 21, 2022. Phase II is scheduled to begin fourth quarter of 2022 with a planned completion of March 2023. Phase II includes an addition that will add office spaces, conference rooms and expanded administrative capacity that will allow the program to expand service lines across process disorders and eating disorders. (2) Changes in square footage of departments and units The building will undergo a 2,200 square foot addition that does not impact department or unit square footage. The addition will house various administrative spaces. 5 (3) Physical plant or location changes Physical plant is undergoing renovations to ensure compliance and operational efficiency for proposed use (4) Changes to affected services following completion of the project The completion of the project will afford the facility the ability to expand service lines, to include the proposed process and eating disorder units on the third floor (5) Outline the project schedule. Phase I renovations were completed on October 21, 2022. Phase II renovations projected completion March 2023. 9.

Drug and Alcohol Use Disorder Nationally The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) for year 2020 supports the need for the expansion of available beds in the State of Maryland. The NSDUH is a survey conducted \u00b7 annually and sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The NSDUH survey functions as a valuable source of information on illicit drug and alcohol use in the United States for individuals ages 12 years and older. The 2020 NSDUH Survey had the following key findings: Illicit Drug Use In the year leading up to the 2020 survey, 83.8 million individuals ages 12 or older used illicit drugs. For the purposes of this survey, illicit drugs includes: heroin, inhalants, methamphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, psychotherapeutic drugs, and marijuana. 83.8 million accounting for 30.3% of the overall population aged 12 or older. 9.5 million people misused opioids, accounting for 3.4% of the total population aged 12 or older. Opioid misuse rates remain relatively static between 2017-2020 across those that are 12 or older and 26 or older. Prescription pain reliever misuse remains staggeringly high with 9.3 million individuals aged 12 or older having misused in the past year, 3.3% of the population Heroin use shows a slight rate increase at 902,000 individuals aged 12 or older. Alcohol Use Alcohol use disorder is present in 55.9 million individuals aged 12 or older, and particularly high among those aged 18-25 -where 5.2 million individuals consume alcohol to a clinically relevant level (15.6%). 22.4 million individuals 26 or older consumed alcohol to a clinically relevant level (10.3%) 25.9% of the adult population over 18 had consumed alcohol excessively in the past year. Half of all individuals aged 12 or older had tried alcohol in the past year II.

When considering the continued opioid crisis and trending increased alcohol consumption and abuse, state and national data suggests that there are not currently sufficient beds to meet the needs of Maryland residents struggling with substance use disorders . . 05C. Sliding Fee Scale. An applicant must establish a sliding fee scale for gray area patients consistent with the client's ability to pay. Applicant Response: Al pas will utilize a sliding scale for fees incurred as part of assessment and treatment. This sliding scale will apply to gray area patients and their ability to pay. The fee schedule below represents discount percentages compared to the facility's standard billing rates charged to commercial insurance carriers: <100% of Federal Poverty Level 75% < 150% but > 100% of Federal Poverty Level 50% <200% but > 150% of Federal Poverty Level 25% .05D. Provision of Service to Indigent and Gray Area Patients. (1) Unless an applicant demonstrates why one or more of the following standards should not apply or should be modified, an applicant seeking to establish or to expand a Track One intermediate care facility must: (a) Establish a sliding fee scale for gray area patients consistent with a client's ability to pay; (b) Committhat it will provide 30 percent or more of its proposed annual adolescent intermediate care facility bed days to indigent and gray area patients; and (c) Commit that it will provide 15 percent of more of its proposed annual adult intermediate care facility bed days to indigent or gray area patients.

B. If a proposed project has received a preference in a Certificate of Need review pursuant to this regulation, but the project sponsor subsequently determines that providing the identified type or scope of service is beyond the facility's clinical or financial resources: 27 (1) The project sponsor must notify the Commission in writing before beginning to operate the facility, and seek Commission approval for any change in its array of services pursuant to COMAR 10.24.01.17. (2) The project sponsor must show good cause why it will not provide the identified service, and why the effectiveness of its treatment program will not be compromised in the absence of the service for which a preference was awarded; and (3) The Commission, in its sole discretion, may determine that the change constitutes an impermissible modification, pursuant to COMAR 10.24.01.17C(1 ). Applicant Response: This standard is not applicable because this is not a comparative review. B. NEED COMAR 10.24.01.08G(3)(b) Need. The Commission shall consider the applicable need analysis in the State Health Plan. If no State Health Plan need analysis is applicable, the Commission shall consider whether the applicant has demonstrated unmet needs of the population to be served, and established that the proposed project meets those needs. INSTRUCTIONS: Please discuss the need of the population served or to be served by the Project. Responses should include a quantitative analysis that, at a minimum, describes the Project's expected service area, population size, characteristics, and projected growth. If the relevant chapter of the State Health Plan includes a need standard or need projection methodology, please reference/address it in your response. For applications proposing to address the need of special population groups, please specifically identify those populations that are underserved and describe how this Project will address their needs. If the project involves modernization of an existing facility through renovation and/or expansion, provide a detailed explanation of why such modernization is needed by the service area population.

Complete Table C (Statistical Projections -Entire Facility) from the CON Application Table Package. Applicant Response: Please refer to the Applicant's response to COMAR 10.24.14.058 above. 28 C. AVAILABILITY OF MORE COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES COMAR 10.24.01.08G(3)(c) Availability of More Cost-Effective Alternatives. The Commission shall compare the cost effectiveness of the proposed project with the cost effectiveness of providing the service through alternative existing facilities, or through an alternative facility that has submitted a competitive application as part of a comparative review. INSTRUCTIONS: Please describe the planning process that was used to develop the proposed project. This should include a full explanation of the primary goals or objectives of the project or the problem(s) being addressed by the project. It should also identify the alternative approaches to achieving those goals or objectives or solving those problem(s) that were considered during the project planning process, including the alternative of the services being provided by existing facilities. For all alternative approaches, provide information on the level of effectiveness in goal or objective achievement or problem resolution that each alternative would be likely to achieve and the costs of each alternative. The cost analysis should go beyond development cost to consider life cycle costs of project alternatives. This narrative should clearly convey the analytical findings and reasoning that supported the project choices made. It should demonstrate why the proposed project provides the most effective goal and objective achievement or the most effective solution to the identified problem(s) for the level of cost required to implement the project, when compared to the effectiveness and cost of alternatives including the alternative of providing the service through alternative existing facilities, or through an alternative facility that has submitted a competitive application as part of a comparative review. Applicant Response: The proposed project involves renovating an existing, previously unoccupied structure, to create a modern biophilic and research oriented Intermediate Care Facility and Residential Rehabilitation program for substance use disorders, process disorders and eating disorders. Alpas selected the proposed location based on the lack of sufficient treatment beds to meet the needs of the proposed patient population within the State of Maryland. The acquisition of existing providers does not address the lack of sufficient treatment beds to meet the demonstrated need for additional ICF bed capacity to serve needs of those suffering from substance use disorders, process disorders and eating disorders and fails to sufficiently benefit residents of the State of Maryland. Additionally, increasing bed counts within existing facilities fails to comprehensively address the complex co-occurring nature of the behavioral health concerns that so many patients present with. Alpas brings a unique and modern approach to behavioral health interventions, with a focus on driving the field forward towards more effective approaches. A variety of data has shown that relapse rates among alcohol and illicit substance users remains high at 85% within a year of the completion of treatment. Traditional efforts have failed an increasingly complex patient population. Alpas brings evidence-based practices merged with novel targeted interventions to stabilize and guide our patients towards a self-guided recovery. Our treatment efforts are partnered with research conducted by the University of Pennsylvania to drive the field towards more innovative treatment methods that bolster the patient experience and spirit. 29 Alpas will bring an unparalleled treatment experience to the in-network coverage space. D. VIABILITY OF THE PROPOSAL COMAR 10.24.01.08G(3)(d) Viability of the Proposal.

The Loan Agreement (Exhibit 12) and the extension of over $42 million in credit to the Applicant for the project is documentation of the Applicant's strong financial condition and creditworthiness and the availability of sufficient resources to complete renovations and working capital until revenues The project has committed funds to cover a full year of operating expenses through this loan. Alpas is not dependent on Day 1 revenues to remain operational. The program design and operation includes a scheduled ramp up to control costs while providing sufficient bed availability to meet growing demand. The funds committed by Colliers are fully available for immediate deployment. Alpas, having funds readily committed and available for deployment, completed the renovations to the extent necessary for the project to operate at a 3.1, 3.3, 3.5 level of care provision as constructed. With a CON, the addition of Level 3.7 can be made quickly in the existing units to meet the demonstrated need for this level of service. The facility would be capable of opening shortly after the provision of CON and licensure. Land use had been approved for the facility as previously built. Necessary zoning was obtained prior to purchase. Wilmot Sanz Architecture in Rockville, MD is responsible for the design. Alpas is represented by Pure Project Management of Philadelphia, PA for design and build. Whiting Turner Contracting Company of Maryland is responsible for the build-out. The project and its timelines were part of an initial contract prepared by Wilmot Sanz and Whiting Turner, Phase 1 of the renovations are complete and the the overall build is slated for a March 2023 completion and remains on schedule and budget.

No Maryland Certificates of Need have been applied for or granted to Alpas Wellness over the prior 15 years. F. IMPACT ON EXISTING PROVIDERS AND THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM COMAR 10.24.01.08G(3)(f) Impact on Existing Providers and the Health Care Delivery System. An applicant shall provide information and analysis with respect to the impact of the proposed project on existing health care providers in the health planning region, including the impact on geographic and demographic access to services, on occupancy, on costs and charges of other providers, and on costs to the health care delivery system. INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide an analysis of the impact of the proposed project. Please assure that all sources of information used in the impact analysis are identified and identify all the assumptions made in the impact analysis with respect to demand for services, payer mix, access to service and cost to the health care delivery system including relevant populations considered in the analysis, and changes in market share, with information that supports the validity of these assumptions. Provide an analysis of the following impacts: a) On the volume of service provided by all other existing health care providers that are likely to experience some impact as a result of this project; b) On the payer mix of all other existing health care providers that are likely to experience some impact on payer mix as a result of this project. If an applicant for a new nursing home claims no impact on payer mix, the applicant must identify the likely source of any expected increase in patients by payer. c) On access to health care services for the service area population that will be served by the project.

If the applicant is an existing facility or program, provide a summary description of the impact of the proposed project on the applicant's costs and charges, consistent with the information provided in the Project Budget, the projections of revenues and expenses, and the work force information. Applicant Response: As noted in response to the Commission's Bed Need Methodology, a net bed need of 239-300 in the Southern Maryland region has been demonstrated for target year 2025. The addition of 36 Level 3. 7 beds by Alpas will help meet this need. With the approved beds, the Southern Maryland region still projects to require an additional 203-264 beds. Alpas does not believe its proposed 36 additional beds will have a significant impact on other providers. Within the Primary Market Area (PMA) of 30 miles, there exists a single Track One provider, RCA Waldorf which is located 5.5 miles from Alpas' proposed location. Despite the proximity, RCA offers 64 beds and the projected bed need for the target year 2025 far exceeds the 32 coverage offered by RCA's Track One beds, even in consideration of the additional 36 Track One beds as proposed by Alpas. Within the Secondary Market Area (SMA) of 60 miles, there is a single Track One provider, Maryland House Detox, located 53.1 miles from the proposed Alpas location. The 40 beds offered at Maryland House Detox are a significant distance from Alpas' proposed location and again, fall short of the significant bed need demonstrated in Maryland . Healthcare costs are not expected to increase as this level of care maintains contracted rates with payers. The additional support services and referral options Alpas offers can serve to benefit the healthcare system with the additional Track One bed availability , the additional behavioral health service lines offered, and the-expansion of the network of care in Southern Maryland.

Trends are examined by age at time of death, race/ethnicity, gender, place of death, and substances related to death. This report was prepared using drug and alcohol intoxication data housed in a registry developed and maintained by the Vital Statistics Administration (VSA) of the Maryland Department of Health (MOH). The methodology for reporting on drug-related intoxication deaths in Maryland was developed by VSA with assistance from the MOH Behavioral Health Administration, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) and the Maryland Poison Control Center. Assistance was also provided by authors of a Baltimore City Health Department report on intoxication deaths.1 Sources of data The data included in this report were obtained mainly from the OCME. Maryland law requires the OCME to investigate all drug deaths occurring in the State, as well as non-natural and unattended deaths. In these instances, information compiled during an investigation is used to determine the cause or causes of death. Depending on the circumstances, an investigation may involve a combination of scene examination, review of witness reports, review of medical and police reports, autopsy, and toxicological analysis of autopsy specimens. Toxicological analysis is routinely performed when there is suspicion that a death was the result of drug or alcohol intoxication. A small number of death records involving intoxication deaths were filed by sources other than OCME and were identified through death records maintained by VSA. This included records filed by medical facilities rather than OCME, and records filed by federal investigators following deaths involving U.S. military personnel. Information available on these cases was included in the registry. Information on place of death and race/ethnicity was missing for a small number of records provided by OCME and was obtained through death certificate data. Death certificate data were also used to update demographic information on records that were amended after the records were filed with the Division of Vital Records. 1 Office of Epidemiology and Planning, Baltimore City Health Department. Intoxication Deaths Associated with Drugs of Abuse or Alcohol. Baltimore City, Maryland: Baltimore City Health Department. January 2007. 1 Identification of drug-related intoxication deaths For the purpose of this report, an intoxication death was defined as a death that was the result of recent ingestion or exposure to alcohol or another type of drug, including heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, prescription opioids, benzodiazepines, phencyclidine (PCP), methamphetamines, and other and unprescribed drugs. OCME provided all records to VSA for which the text of the cause of death included one or more of the following terms: poisoning, intoxication, toxicity, inhalation, ingestion, overdose, exposure, chemical, effects, or use. Any records provided by OCME that were not unintentional drug\u00ad related intoxication deaths, such as deaths due to smoke inhalation, carbon monoxide intoxication, cold exposure, and chronic use of alcohol or other drugs, were excluded in the registry. Also excluded from the registry were deaths for which the manner of death was determined to be natural, suicide, or homicide. Analyses Trends in the number of unintentional drug-and alcohol-related intoxication deaths occurring in Maryland during the years 2011-2020 were analyzed by age group, race/ethnicity, gender, place of occurrence of death, and substances related to the death. Changes over time were examined for deaths related to the following substances: 1. Opioids a. Heroin b. Prescription opioids c. Fentanyl (prescribed and illicit) 2. Cocaine 3. Benzodiazepines and related drugs 4. Phencyclidine 5. Methamphetamine 6. Alcohol The number of deaths by place of occurrence was computed by jurisdiction and by region, categorized as follows: Northwest Area Baltimore Metro National Capital Southern Area Eastern Shore Area\u00b7 Area Area Garrett Co. Baltimore City Montgomery Co. Calvert Co. Cecil Co. Allegany Co. Baltimore Co. Prince George's Co. Charles Co. Kent Co. Washington Co. Anne Arundel Co. St. Mary's Co. Queen Anne's Co. Frederick Co. Carroll Co. Caroline Co. Howard Co. Talbot Co. Harford Co. Dorchester Co. Wicomico Co. Somerset Co. Worcester Co. 2 Trends in deaths for the period 2011-2020 are shown in Figures 1 through 42. Data on intoxication deaths related to a combination of substances are shown in Figures 43 through 49. Counts of the number of total deaths and deaths related to classes of substances or specific substances by place of occurrence are shown in Tables 1 through 12. Age-adjusted death rates Age-adjusted death rates by place of residence are shown in Figure 50. Age\u00ad adjusted death rates were calculated in order to allow for the comparison of drug death rates among Maryland jurisdictions. Unlike all other data included in this report, these rates are based on place of residence of the decedent rather than place where the drug-related incident occurred. Since out-of-state data are generally not available until approximately six months after the close of a calendar year, only data through 2019 were available at the time this report was prepared. Therefore, age-adjusted rates cover the period 2017 through 2019. Since the number of drug deaths is relatively small in many Maryland jurisdictions, it was necessary to calculate rates for a three year period in order to obtain counts that were large enough to be used to calculate stable rates. Drug death information received from other states is far less detailed than the data available from OCME and often does not include information on the substances involved in a death. For that reason, rates could only be calculated for total deaths and not deaths related to individual substances. **Since an intoxication death may involve more than one substance, counts of deaths related to specific substances do not sum to the total number of deaths in this report.** Opioid-related deaths Opioids include heroin and oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, tramadol and codeine, and prescribed and illicit fentanyl. In this report, an opioid was considered to be associated with a death if a specific opioid drug was indicated in the cause of death. If the cause of death did not identify a specific drug (e.g., the cause of death indicated \"Narcotic Intoxication\"), OCME toxicology results were reviewed to determine whether the presence of any opioid drug was detected. If so, the cause of death was considered to be opioid-related, regardless of the level of the drug. Scene investigation notes were also reviewed in an attempt to better categorize death records with non-specific causes of death. Since heroin is rapidly metabolized into morphine, the records of many deaths that are likely to be heroin-related do not list \"heroin\" as a cause of death, and therefore cannot be identified using only information listed in the cause of death. Therefore, a combination of information contained in the cause of death field, toxicology results, and scene investigation 3 notes is used to identify heroin-related deaths. In this report, a death was considered to be heroin-related if: 1. \"Heroin\" was mentioned in the cause of death; or 2. The toxicology screen showed a positive result for 6-monacetylmorphine; or 3. The toxicology screen showed positive results for both morphine and quinine; or 4. The cause of death was nonspecific and the scene investigation notes indicated that heroin was likely to have been involved in the death; or 5. The death was associated with morphine through either cause of death information or toxicology results, unless information contained in the investigation notes did not support this assumption. A record was not coded as heroin-related, despite the presence of morphine, if OCME determined that another substance caused the death. Prescription opioid-related deaths were defined as deaths that involve one or more prescription opioids, as identified through cause of death information when a specific drug was indicated and through toxicology results when the cause of death was nonspecific. Prescription is an opioid analgesic approved for patient use to manage severe or chronic pain. There are also forms of fentanyl that are produced illicitly in clandestine laboratories and mixed with (or substituted for) heroin or other illicit drugs. Although in some cases it was difficult to determine whether a prescribed or illicit form of fentanyl was related to a death, the count of prescription opioid-related drugs in this report includes only fentanyl deaths in which a prescription form of the drug was clearly involved. Fentanyl-related deaths began increasing in late 2013 as a result of overdoses involving nonpharmaceutical fentanyl, that is, nonprescription fentanyl produced in clandestine laboratories and mixed with, or substituted for, heroin or other illicit substances. Nearly all fentanyl-related deaths occurring in recent years have involved the use of nonpharmaceutical fentanyl. Fentanyl is many times more potent than heroin, and greatly increases the risk of an overdose death. Carfentanil, an extremely potent analog of fentanyl, was first detected in Maryland drug intoxication death cases in 2017, and is reported separately in Figures 21 and 22. Cocaine-related deaths Cocaine is a highly addictive stimulant drug derived from coca leaves. It is frequently mixed with other non-psychoactive substances, such as cornstarch or talcum powder, to dilute its potency, however in the last few years, it has been mixed with fentanyl. 4 Benzodiazepine-related deaths Benzodiazepines are a class of depressants that include drugs such as alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, and multiple related drugs. The category of benzodiazepine\u00ad related drugs in this report includes both benzodiazepines and related drugs, such as zolpidem, which have similar sedative effects. Phencyclidine-related deaths Phencyclidine, or phenylcyclohexyl piperidine (PCP), is an illicit hallucinogenic drug that can induce acute psychosis and aggressive behaviors. In the last few years it has been mixed with fentanyl. Methamphetamine-related deaths Methamphetamine is another highly addictive stimulant drug. Illicit forms of methamphetamine have also been found to be mixed with fentanyl or other opioids. 5 SUMMARY OF TRENDS IN DRUG INTOXICATION DEATHS-2011 TO 2020 Total drug and alcohol intoxication deaths The number of drug-and alcohol-related intoxication deaths occurring in Maryland increased in 2020, after a slight decrease seen in 2019. The total number of deaths in 2020 was 2,799, which represented an 18% increase from the number of deaths (2,379) in 2019. Between the years 2011 through 2016, intoxication deaths increased among all age groups, and were highest among those aged 45-54 years old. The number of deaths among those aged <25 years and those 25-34 started to decline through 2019. In 2020, the older age groups saw the steepest increases in deaths, with those aged 55 years an older having the highest number of deaths each year since 2018. Between 2019 and 2020, deaths increased among those aged 45-54 years by 23% and increased by 20% among those aged 55 years and over. The number of deaths among non-Hispanic Whites decreased in 2019 but increased in 2020 by 16%. Deaths have increased steadily among non-Hispanic Blacks since 2012, and increased 16% between 2019 and 2020. Among Hispanics, deaths increased from 75 in 2019 to 126 in 2020. Deaths increased by 17% among men between 2019 and 2020, after slight decrease between 2018 and 2019. Deaths among women increased 19% between 2019 and 2020 after a three-year plateau. Intoxication deaths were 2.6 times higher among men than women in 2020. Two counties had no change in the number of deaths occurring between 2019 and 2020: St. Mary's and Frederick. Although there were decreases in the number of deaths occurring in five jurisdictions of the state between 2019 and 2020: Calvert, Carroll, Garrett, Harford, and Kent, the remainder saw increases: Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Caroline, Cecil, Charles, Dorchester, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's, Queen Anne's, Somerset, Talbot, Washington, Wicomico, and Worcester. Opioid-related deaths Ninety percent of all intoxication deaths that occurred in Maryland in 2020 were opioid\u00ad related. Opioid-related deaths include deaths related to heroin, prescription opioids, and nonpharmaceutical fentanyl. The number of opioid-related deaths increased by 20% between 2019 and 2020, following a 2% decrease the previous year. Non opioid-related drug deaths increased slightly in 2020. Fentanyl-related deaths continued to drive opioid-related deaths. Between 2019 and 2020 the number of fentanyl-related deaths increased by 22% (from 1927 to 2342). The number of heroin-related deaths declined for the fourth straight year, decreasing by 55% between 2016 and 2020 to 548 deaths. The number of prescription opioid-related deaths increased by 23% between 2019 and 2020, following a three-year decrease. 6 Fentanyl Fentanyl-related deaths have increased rapidly since 2013, with a 229% increase between 2015 and 2016. Deaths related to fentanyl increased sharply again in 2020, rising 22% to a 10 year high of 2,342 deaths. In 2020, Fentanyl-related deaths rose among all age groups, with the highest increases among those 25-34 years (25%) and among those 55 and older (28%). Fentanyl-related deaths increased among non-Hispanic Whites (19%) and non-Hispanic Blacks (20%) between 2019 and 2020. The number of deaths among Hispanics nearly doubled, increasing 96% from 2019. Fentanyl-related deaths increased by 20% among men and by 26% among women in 2020. In 2020, fentanyl deaths increased in 18 jurisdictions, declined in 4 jurisdictions, and remained the same in 2 jurisdictions. Thirty-six percent of fentanyl-related deaths in 2020 occurred in combination with cocaine, 22% in combination with heroin, 18% in combination with alcohol, and 13% in combination with prescription opioids. Deaths related to carfentanil (a fentanyl analog) were first identified in 2017 (testing began in 2016). There were 60 carfentanil-related deaths in 2017, however this number dropped to 2 deaths in 2018 and 2019. There were no carfentanil deaths in 2020. Heroin Heroin-related deaths continued to decrease in 2020, declining by 25% since 2019. There was a decrease in Heroin-related deaths in 2020 among all age groups. Deaths among both sexes continued to decline for the fourth consecutive year, falling 24% among men and 26% among women. Heroin-related deaths declined among non-Hispanic Whites (27%), non-Hispanic Blacks (21 %) and Hispanics (20%) in 2020. In 2019, heroin deaths declined in 16 jurisdictions, remained the same in 3 jurisdictions, and increased in 5 jurisdictions. Ninety-four percent of heroin-related deaths in 2020 occurred in combination with fentanyl, 38% in combination with cocaine, 19% in combination with prescription opioids, and 12% in combination with alcohol. Prescription Opioids The number of prescription opioid-related deaths had been rising since 2013, but started to decline 2017. After a three-year decrease, deaths increased sharply in 2020 rising by 23% compared with 2019. In 2020, the number of prescription opioid-related deaths rose in all age groups. Prescription opioid-related deaths increased among non-Hispanic Whites (18%), non\u00ad Hispanic Blacks (31 % ) from 2019 to 2020. The number of deaths nearly tripled for Hispanics. Deaths related to prescription opioids increased by 20% among men and by 28% among women in 2020. 7 Cocaine-related deaths The number of cocaine-related deaths increased 6% in 2020 following a 2% decline in 2019. Cocaine-related deaths increased in 2020 among those 25-34 years (12%), those 45-54 (3%), and those 55 years and older (18%), but decreased among those under 25 (9%) and those 35-44 years (6%). Cocaine-related deaths increased by 6% among non-Hispanic Whites and 4% among non-Hispanic Blacks in 2020. There was a 59% increase among Hispanics. Cocaine-related deaths among women increased by 20% in 2020, while the number of deaths among men was similar to 2019. The overall increase in cocaine-related deaths is largely the result of deaths occurring in combination with opioids. Ninety-one percent of cocaine-related deaths in 2020 occurred in combination with fentanyl, and 23% in combination with heroin. Benzodiazepine-related deaths The number of benzodiazepine-related deaths increased by 7% between 2019 and 2020, reversing a two-year decline. Benzodiazepine-related deaths rose in 2020 among those aged under 25 years (60% ), those 35-44 years (27%), and those 45-54 years (47%). Deaths decreased among those aged 25-34 years (23%) and those 55 years and over (26%). Deaths increased among non-Hispanic Whites by 11 % in 2020, but remained stable among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics. A thirteen percent increase was seen among men, while deaths remained stable among women in 2020. Ninety-two percent of benzodiazepine-related deaths in 2020 were in combination with opioids. Seventy-one percent of all benzodiazepine-related deaths occurred in combination with fentanyl, 38% in combination with prescription opioids, and 24% in combination with heroin. Phencyclidine-related deaths (PCP) The number of phencyclidine-related deaths has been rising since 2018. These deaths increased by 29% between 2019 and 2020. Phencyclidine-related deaths increased among all age groups between 2019 and 2020 except those under 25 years, who had no deaths in 2020. Deaths increased among non-Hispanic Blacks (55%) and decreased 20% in non\u00ad Hispanic Whites between 2019 and 2020. After three years of no deaths among Hispanics, there were four deaths in 2020. Deaths increased by 30% among men in 2020, and increased by 29% among women. Seventy-six percent of phencyclidine-related deaths in 2020 were in combination with opioids. The number of phencyclidine-related deaths occurring in Prince George's County was three times higher than the next highest jurisdiction. 8 Methamphetamine-related deaths The number of methamphetamine-related deaths has been rising since 2015. These deaths increased by 85% between 2019 and 2020. Methamphetamine-related deaths increased among all age groups. Deaths increased among non-Hispanic Whites (75%) and non-Hispanic Blacks (138%). There was one death among Hispanics, the first death since 2015. Deaths increased among both sexes, 90% among males and 70% among females. Eighty-three percent of methamphetamine-related deaths in 2020 were in combination with opioids. Eighty percent of all methamphetamine-related deaths occurred in combination with fentanyl, 16% in combination with heroin, and 11 % in combination with prescription opioids. Twenty-four percent of methamphetamine-related deaths occurred in combination with cocaine. The number of methamphetamine-related deaths occurring in Cecil County was twice as high as the next highest jurisdiction. Alcohol-related deaths The number of alcohol-related deaths had declined steadily since 2017. However, deaths sharply increased by 34% between 2019 and 2020. Alcohol-related deaths in 2020 rose in every age group. Deaths increased in 2020 by 41 % among non-Hispanic Whites, by 19% among non\u00ad Hispanic Blacks, and by 57% among Hispanics. Deaths increased in 2020 among both men and women, 34% among males and 33% among females. Eighty-one percent of acute alcohol-related deaths in 2020 occurred in combination with opioids. Seventy-five percent occurred in combination with fentanyl, 27% occurred in combination with cocaine, and 11 % occurred in combination with heroin. Age-adjusted death rates Age-adjusted death rates for the period 2017-2019 ranged from lows of 9.7 and 11.7 per 100,000 population in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties, respectively, to a high of 95.5 per 100,000 population in Baltimore City. The Maryland state age-adjusted mortality rate for deaths related to unintentional drug and alcohol-related intoxication was 33.5 deaths per 100,000 population over the three-year period. 9 TOTAL INTOXICATION DEATHS 10 Ill ..c: +,I ns <1> \"'O -0 I,.. <1> Ill ..c: +,I ns <1> \"Cl -0 I,.. <1> .c E :, 2 Figure 1.

TABLE A PHYSICAL BED CAPACITY BEFORE AND AFTER PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS: Identify the location of each nursing unit (add or delete rows if necessary) and specify the room and bed count before and after the project in accordance with the definition of physical capacity noted below. ApjJlicants should add columns and recalculate formulas to address rooms with 3 and 4 bed capacity. NOTE: Physical capacity is the total number of beds that could be physically set up in space Without significant renovations. This should be the maximum operating capacity under normal, noneme,yency circumstances and is a physical count of bed capacity, rather than a measure of staffing capacity. A room with two headwafls and two sets of gasses should be counted as having capacity for two beds, even If It is typically set up and operated with only one bed. A room with one headwall and one set of gasses is counted as a private room, even if it is large enough from a square footage perspective to be used as a S6Tliprivate room, since renovation/construction would be required to convert ft to semi.private use. If the ho$pltal operates pa6ent rooms that contain no headwalls or a single headwall, but are normafly used to accommodate one or more than one patient (e.g., for psychiatric patients), the physical capacity of such rooms should be counted as they are currently used.

Jenkins March 15, 2022 Mike Martin Chief Strategy officer Alpas Wellness 1014 Washington Ave Town of La P{ata La Plata, Maryland 20646 Dear Mr. Martin, Town Manager Brent T. Manuel Assistant Town Manager Michelle D. Miner I am pleased to write a letter of support for Alpas Wellness opening their new facility in La Plata. As the Mayor of the Town of La Plata, I have witnessed the surge in the mental health crisis and substance use disorders over the years with little to no resources available to those afflicted. Treatment centers have been popping up all over the United States as the opioid addiction epidemic rages. Still, none of them have combined a therapeutic strategy with proprietary technology to treat their clients. That's what makes Alpas Wellness exceptional. I understand that this state-of-the-art facility will provide tailored, unique programs to those in need not only from Maryland but nationwide. Looking at what your facility offers, I am thrilled that over 1 20 full-time positions will be created within our community, giving our Town's economy a significant boost. Beyond treating your clients, I appreciate your commitment to providing outreach and educational programs for those within our community. The more we know, the more we can identify the signs of someone struggling and get them the help they need. The fight against addiction and substance use disorder is far from over, but with the support and assistance of facilities such as yours, there is hope. I fully support Alpas Wellness expanding their campus to La Plata and look forward to a successful partnership for years to come. Sincerely, L J~Jam~ Mayor, Town of La Plata La Plata Town Hall, 305 Queen Anne Street, P.O. Box 2268, La Plata, Maryland site: www.townoflaplata.org March 14, 2022 Mike Martin CHARLES COUNTY GOVERNMENT Economic Development Department Kelly A. Robertson-Slagle Director Chief Strategy officer Al pas Wellness 1014 Washington Ave La Plata, Maryland 20646 Dear Mr. Martin, Phone 1301-885-1340 Fax 301-885-1341 Email info@MeetCh arlesCounty.com Please accept this letter in support for Al pas Wellness to be located at 1014 Washington Avenue, La Plata, Maryland. We are thrilled that you have chosen Charles County to make your valuable investment. The resulting economic impact to the town and the county does not go unnoticed, In addition, we welcome the much needed services for citizens with mental health needs. As evidenced by the Governor's strong push to combat opioid epidemic through the creation of the Heroin and Opioid emergency Task force, the county appreciates everything that groups like yours do to save lives and help people to recover from their addiction and turn their lives around. We understand that treatment is but one step in the process of fighting against addiction and mental health issues. Unfortuna tely, due to a lack of treatment options in their area, it is a step that far too many people find themselves unable to take. We believe strongly that this facility will be an asset to not only Charles County, but the entire Southern Maryland community.

Not only are these services much-needed, but a facility such as this one is consistent with one of the economic development focuses of Charles County. Unfortunately, substance abuse and addiction is a significant problem, not just locally, but nationally. It appears to have accelerated throughout the pandemic, making your work even more critical. I appreciate the efforts of organizations like Al pas Wellness in helping people turn \u00b7their lives around. The College of Southern Maryland offers several programs that support the work of organizations like Al pas. Not only do we offer Nursing, Allied Health, and Health Careers programs, we offer Human Services degrees and certificates to include a certificate in Alcohol and Drug Counseling.

PURPOSE: To define the protocol for patients admitted for detoxification from drugs and alcohol. II. POLICY: All patients who have symptoma tic withdrawal from drugs and alcohol are treated with a prescribed detoxification protocol related to the substance that was abused. Ill. DEFINITIONS Buprenorphine -A synthetic narcotic with both antagonist and agonist properties. It will be administered in its oral form, which is currently marketed as Subutex Buprenorphine/Nalo xone -This combination consists of buprenorphine as described above combined with naloxone, which is a pure opiate antagonist. This medication is marketed under the trade name of Suboxone. The purpose for this medication combination is to prevent unauthorized IV injection of the medication. If injected, the naloxone contained in the compound would produce an instant narcotic antagonist effect and the patient would feel significant levels of withdrawal. Taken orally, the naloxone component of this medication has no effect IV. SCOPE and RESPONSIBILITY The physician, physician assistant, or certified registered nurse practitioner/advanced practice nurse prescribes the medical detoxification protocol and the Nursing staff carries out these orders V. PROCEDURES 1. Physician, physician assistant, or certified registered nurse practitioner/advanced practice nurse is to follow all protocols listed in this policy. 2. All protocols are to be ordered utilizing the Electronic Healthcare System 3. A thorough History and Physical Examination is be completed on all patients upon admission. An attempt must be made to obtain a complete medical and addiction history from the patient, regardless of their state of intoxication or withdrawal. History from significant others should be Reviewed and Revised August 2022 obtained, if available. A thorough physical exam is mandatory in all cases except when a patient is combative. 4. Chemically dependent patients frequently present with known or unknown co-existing medical or psychiatric illnesses that need to be identified early in treatment. Simply assuming the patient's presenting clinical status is solely due to their current state of intoxication or withdrawal is unacceptable and may result in complications A. Routine Lab Orders 1. CBC w/Differential 2. Complete Metabolic Profile 3. RPR 4. Urinalysis/Urine Drug Screen 5. ECG -if clinically indicated 6. Chest X-Ray -if clinically indicated -A chest x-ray should be obtained on all HIV patients and patients with a history of positive PPD 7. PPD -intermediate strength (Mantoux) -if negative in the past. A PPD is not necessary if a patient has written documentation of a negative PPD within one month of admission 8. Urine pregnancy test -on any woman of child bearing age and capacity 9. HIV testing-Will be completed if the patient agrees. A signed consent form must be completed by the nurse or the laboratory B. Alcohol Detoxification 1. In cases No significant withdrawal symptomatology present -vital signs stable, no coarse tremors, no hallucinations, no history of seizures i. Monitor vital signs q shift or more frequently if indicated ii. When the patient presents in an intoxicated state, it is best to continue assessing until the patient has begun to demonstrate withdrawal symptomatology. During the initial phase of treatment , observe these patients closely for progressive obtundation and evolving coma iii. Thiamine 50-lO0mg p.a. or IM iv. Diazepam 5-l0mg p.a. q 4-6h if indicated. Diazepam is not usually indicated when the patient is intoxicated but should be started if and when withdrawal Reviewed and Revised August 2022 symptoms appear. Since it is difficult to predict the degree of withdrawal symptomatology a patient will exhibit, consider a prn order initially. Once stabilized with benzodiazepines, a tapering dosage can be initiated with a prn benzodiazepine order for breakthrough withdrawal signs and symptoms. Chlordiazepoxide may also be used in place of diazepam. Lorazepam or oxazepam should be considered in the elderly patient or those patients with hepatic impairment. Short acting benzodiazepines should be tapered more slowly than the longer acting benzodiazepines to prevent a rebound in withdrawal symptoms and complications v. Most texts do not recommend the routine use of phenytoin. However, consider phenytoin if the past history of seizures are not clearly withdrawal related or have occurred several weeks after cessation of alcohol intake. If patient has a positive seizure history that requires phenytoin, and the patient has been non-compliant, it is suggested to then give loading dose of 300mg p.o. stat, and repeat q 4h x 2. Then give 100mg p.o. tid-qid starting the following day. Check phenytoin level in 3-4 days. The loading dosage must be used with caution if the patient has liver or renal disease vi. Provide B-Complex and/or multi-vitamins if clinically indicated vii. Folic Acid, 1mg p.o. once daily if peripheral neuropathy is suspected 2. In cases where significant withdrawal symptomatology is present -elevated temperature, blood pressure and pulse, marked tremors of hands/tongue, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, diaphoresis, seizures, insomnia i. Vital signs q 1/2h until stable ii. Stat CBC, Lytes, FBS, BUN, Creatinine, prn until stable. Use lorazepam 1-2mg q 4-8h in older patients or in presence of marked hepatic impairment. If parenteral benzodiazepines are indicated, lorazepam may be given IM, whereas diazepam IM should be avoided due to erratic absorption. Lorazepam IM is probably the drug of choice in initial treatment of significantly advanced delirium tremens vi. If patient's in acute delirium tremens the patient should be transferred to an acute care hospital or treatment vii. If IV's are utilized, give Thiamine prior to administration of glucose Reviewed and Revised August 2022 _Alpas Wellness La Plata LLC Policy and Procedure viii. If pulse or blood pressure is persistently elevated, consider utilizing a beta\u00ad blocker if there are no pulmonary or cardiac contraind ications. Atenolol 50mg once daily, a beta-1 selective blocker, appears to work well. Clonidine has also been utilized in alcohol withdrawal. However, there is no evidence indicating that these drugs will prevent seizures or DT's. In fact, use of the above such medications may mask impending withdrawal seizures or delirium tremens. Thus, these medications should be used cautiously C. SEDATIVES DETOXIFICATION 1. Withdrawal signs present (tremulousness, anxiety, insomnia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, tendon hyper-reflexia, diaphoresis, orthostat ic hypotension, seizures, delirium) i. If symptoms are mild, quantify addiction (amount used daily); then establish Phenobarbital equivalent from data below case should the daily Phenobarbital dosage exceed 600mg/day c. Once patient appears stabilized x2 days, decrease dose by 30mg/day d. If patient appears intoxicated, secondary to Phenobarbital, (ataxia, slurred speech, nystagmus), then you may need to recalculat e daily dose e. Avoid daily decrease if withdrawal symptoms appear ii. If symptoms moderate to severe, or level of addiction is unclear, may use . Pentobarbital challenge technique: a. Give 200mg Pentobarbital and examine patient in one hour Reviewed and Revised August 2022 1. If patient is asleep, then tolerance is doubtful and there is a questionable need for detox 2. If patient appears intoxicated (slurring of with 125mg to fine nystagmus ), sta1t with 250mg of Phenobarbital/da y 4. If Pentobarbital has no effect or patient still appears to be in withdrawal, stait with an increased dose. If using -~lpas Wellness La Plata LLC Policy and Procedure _ j -=::::=:::.m~ Phenobarbital in acute withdrawal, may want to give initial dose lM b. Once staiting dose is determined , stabilize and then decrease daily and continue to monitor and assess. iii. If no withdrawa l symptoms present, may want to use 200mg Pentobarbital challenge to establish addiction D. BENZODIAZEPINES WITHDRAWAL If patient is dependent upon benzodiazepines, he/she is easily detoxified with other benzodiazepines. Ideally, one should use a long acting benzodiazepine unless medical indications warrant a shorter acting benzodiazepine. If possible, it is best to use a different benzodiazepine than the patient's drug of choice. Phenobarbital may also be used for benzodiazepine withdrawal. E. OPIATE DETOXIFICATION Opiate detoxification may be accomplished by utilizing buprenorphine alone, clonidine alone, methadone alone, or a combination of medications. Below are protocols for opiate detoxification utilizing buprenorphine, clonidine alone and a methadone/clonidine combination. The protocol utilizing buprenorphine is the treatment of choice. However, there may be situations where Methadone or Clonidine alone may be best utilized or preferred by the patient. Before initiating detox protocols, it is imperative that we establish the presence of opiate dependence. This may be accomplished through historical information , physical findings, and Urine Drug Screen. The state of intoxication or withdrawa l needs to be assessed. It is also important to identify any other coexisting drug or alcohol dependencies 1. BUPRENORPHINEPROTOCOL a. If the physician dete1mines the presence of an opiate dependency , the option of utilizing buprenorphine for detoxific ation should discussed with the patient. b. Should the patient agree to use buprenorphine , info1med consent will be obtained c. The nurse will be responsible for observing the patient taking the sublingual tablet ofbuprenorphine and making sure it is dissolved d. Buprenorphine detoxification will proceed per the detoxification protocol e. Subutex will be the first choice or for opiate detoxifica tion f. Buprenorphine detoxification is not to be initiated until the patient is documented to have signs and symptoms of acute opiate withdrawa l and/or a positive UDS g. Buprenorphine detoxification must not be initiated until at least 24 hours after the last dosage of methadone or 12 hours after the last dose of heroin/ opiates Reviewed and Revised August 2022 Alpas WellnessLa Plata LLC PoHcy and Procedure h. Benzodiazepines should be avoided as an adjunctive therapy during buprenorphine treatment. However, in cases where patients are in withdrawal from both opiates and benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines should be used with caution i. Suggested buprenorphine dosages follow: High Dose-Buprenorphine tab Protocol (given 24+hours after last reported use) Day 1 8mgSL administer Q daily, then Day2 GmgSL administer Q daily, then Day3 GmgSL administer Q daily, then Day4 4mgSL administer Q daily, then Days 4mgSL administer Q daily, then Day6 2mgSL administer Q daily, then Day7 2mgSL administer Q daily, then Days 2mgSL administer Q daily, then d/c Low Dose -Buprenorphine tab Protocol (given 24+hours after last reported use) Day 1 8mgSL administer Q daily, then Day2 GmgSL administer Q daily, then Day3 4mgSL administer Q daily, then Day4 2mgSL administer Q daily, then Days 2mgSL administer Q daily, then d/c 2. METHADONE PROTOCOL a. The maximum dose of methadone utilized will be 20mg. It will be tapered by 5mg per day. The methadone can be administered in a single daily dose, or the dosage can be administered in t\\vo doses b. The admitting physician will determine the proper dosage level for a patient. If the admitting physician determining the initial dose is not the attending physician who conducted the Histo1y and Physical examination, the attending physician shall consult with the admitting physician who performed the examination before detennining the patient's initial dose and schedule c. Methadone shall be administered or dispensed in oral fonn only and shall observed d. For patients coming from a methadone maintenance program, they will be advised that they should be tapered down to 20mg before being admitted to our inpatient detoxification program. However, patients not tapered down to 20mg methadone may be considered on a case-by\u00ad case basis, with the knowledge that their daily dose of methadone will not exceed 20mg e. The patient will be made aware of his/her dosage schedule of methadone and how it is to be tapered. The patient must also Reviewed and Revised August 2022 Alpas Wellness La Plata LLC Policy and Procedure understand that we will not waiver from this protocol unless the patient refuses the methadone, or the patient is experiencing adverse affects secondary to the methadone. The patient will be advised in the case of emesis, the dosage will not be re-administered and thus the patient should be advised to request an anti-emetic prior to his/her dose of methadone if nausea is present. Methadone should not be initiated until the patient starts to demonstrate signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Do not administer methadone to an intoxicated patient. f. Specific Orders: 1. Methadone 20mg p.o. daily in single or split dose that decreases by 5mg per day 11. Clonidine -As the methadone is decreased, clonidine may be added. A test dose of 0.1mg may be given, and if tolerated, 0.2mg q 4-6h may be utilized. Hold clonidine if blood pressure is less than 90mmHg systolic or 60mmHg diastolic. A Catapres-TTS 1 or 2 may be used in place of, or along with, p.o. clonidine m. Tigan 250mg vomiting 1v. Benty! 20mg for vm. MVI daily 1x. Benzodiazepines may be utilized, but avoid using large dosages in patients nearing completion of the detoxification program 3. CLONIDINE PROTOCOL a. Clonidine -Give test dose of 0.1mg, then watch blood pressure. If patient's blood pressure is stable in four hours, may give 0.l-0.2mg p.o. q 4-6h pm or routine. BP checks prior to each dose. Hold clonidine if systolic BP is less than 90-1 00mmHg, or diastolic BP is less than 60mmHg. However, these are general guidelines. In someone with an elevated blood pressure, you may want to hold the limit somewhat higher and in someone who presents with a low base line blood pressure, the cut-off points could be somewhat lower. Use clonidine with caution if other anti-hypertensive medications or medicines with potentially hypotensive side effects are used concurrently b. Transdermal clonicline (Catapres-TTS) may be utilized for opiate withdrawal. It is best used after the patient has been stabilized with p.o. clonidine and the withdrawal symptoms are begim1ing to abate. Reviewed and Revised August 2022 Alpas Wellness La Plata LLC Policy and Procedure Always advise the patient of the rationale behind the use of clonidine and the side effects, primarily orthostatic hypertension c. A benzodiazepine, such as diazepam or oxazepam may be utilized. The dosage will vary from patient to patient, and needs to be titrated as clinical needs indicate 1.

PURPOSE: Policy No: 107 Effective Date: Revision Date: To formalize a set of questions administered at specific intervals and assure that the nursing staff will have frequent individualized interactions with the patient. Frequent intervention with the patient provides reassurance and emotiona l support during the period when s/he is apprehensive and experiencing both physical and emotional discomfort. Frequent discussions also begin an early teaching process regarding primary symptoms of the disease process. Without the formalized questions, symptoms such as visual or auditory disturbances may go undetected until the progress to an advanced state. Observations relating to the patient's orientation and thought processes may give an early indication of other organic issues or psychosis. II. POLICY: Nursing will follow Detoxification Procedures for all patients to ensure quality care and patient safety and compliance with all State and Federal Regulations. The detoxification process is based on medical protocol and is monitored by Medical Staff. All medical orders are from physicians/physicians assistant and/or a CRNP. Detoxification services are provided by qualified medical and nursing staff at all times, 24 hours, 7 days a week. 111. PROCEDURES 1. The objectives of following the detoxification procedure is: a. To frequently monitor the patient's status during withdrawal period at regular intervals b. To assure appropriate and effective nursing intervention with the patient c. To assign a numerical value to an evaluation of withdrawal, which may indicate progress or deterioration in patient status d. To focus nursing attention on each area of withdrawal symptoms and to assure consistency in evaluation of patient status e. To begin early patient educational regarding primary symptoms of the disease process to assist in self diagnosis 2. Prior to detoxification protocol, patient undergoes a Nursing Assessment as part of Multidisciplinary Assessment. This includes patient's medical history, health screening and assessment by a physician/physician assistant or CRNP for medication orders 3. The detoxification assessment is utilized by the nurse as a tool to evaluate the patient's level of withdrawal from any chemical substance. The assessment is administered at regular intervals which correlate to the severity of the patient's physical withdrawal from chemical substances.

The patient is asked a set of questions relating to a variety of symptoms, which may include: gastrointestinal, tactile, visual, auditor disturbances, etc. Numbers are recorded in a column on the Assessment Sheet. The numbers are then totaled and thus provide a numerical basis for determining the status and progress of the patient 5. The Detoxification Assessment must be completed by a RN or LPN. Assessment includes obtaining vital signs -pulse, temperature and respiration. This is face to face contact with the patient. The patient's vital signs and physiological responses are recorded at the time of the assessment 6. Nursing Care Plan is completed by nurse and reviewed with patient. This is part of the education process of detoxification protocol with patients. The plan is reviewed continually as patients follow through with detox process 7. The Detoxification Assessment is to be used routinely on all patients admitted for detoxification from any substance 8. The assessment is conducted a minimum of every 4 hours and a maximum of every 8 hours while the patient is experiencing acute withdrawal symptoms (i.e. a D/A score >8). The nurse may increase the frequency of the assessment according to patient's needs 9. Once the acute withdrawal symptoms have subsided, the administration of the assessment may be changed or increased to every 6 hours 10. As part of assessment procedure, any symptoms of medical distress shall be documented addressed with the physician/physician assistant or CRNP and progress shall be noted 11. The detoxification assessment may be discontinued when no sedative medications have been used in four consecutive assessments. Nurse must contact the physican/phys ican assistant or CRNP to receive an order to advance the patient to rehab. The phsycian/physician assistant or CRNP must review the patient's physical status prior writing the order to advance to rehab status 12. Once the order is written, all detoxification medications are discontinued. Once patient is advanced from detox to rehab status, patients are considered for inpatient rehab or aftercare outside the facility where deemed appropriate for the Treatment Team. The patient's primary counselor is responsible for aftercare arrangements and for providing information regarding importance of further treatment past detoxification 13.

However, patients not tapered down to 20mg methadone may be considered on a case-by\u00ad case basis, with the knowledge that their daily dose of methadone will not exceed 20mg e. The patient will be made aware of his/her dosage schedule of methadone and how it is to be tapered. The patient must also understand that we will not waiver from this protocol unless the patient refuses the methadone, or the patient is experiencing adverse affects secondary to the methadone. The patient will be advised in the case of emesis, the dosage will not be re-administered and thus the patient should be advised to request an anti-emetic prior to his/her dose of methadone if nausea is present. Methadone should not be initiated until the patient starts to demonstrate signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Do not administer methadone to an intoxicated patient. f. Specific Orders: i. Methadone 20mg p.o. daily in single or split dose that decreases by 5mg per day 11. Clonidine -As the methadone is decreased, clonidine may be added. A test dose of 0.1mg may be given, and if tolerated, 0.2mg q 4-6h may be utilized. Hold clonidine if blood pressure is less than 90mmHg systolic or 60mmHg diastolic.

Hold clonidine if systolic BP is less than 90-1 00mmHg, or diastolic BP is less than 60mmHg. However, these arn general guidelines. In someone with an elevated blood pressure, you may want to hold the limit somewhat higher and in someone who presents with a low base line blood pressure, the cut-off points could be somewhat lower. Use clonidine with caution if other anti-hypertensive medications or Reviewed and Revised August 2022 Alpas Wellness Plata with potentiall side effects are used concurrently b. Transdermal clonidine (Catapres-TTS) may be utilized for opiate withdrawal. It is best used after the patient has been stabilized with p.o. clonidine and the withdrawal symptoms are beginning to abate. Always advise the patient of the rationale behind the use of clonidine and the side effects, primarily orthostatic hypertension c. A benzodiazepine, such as diazepam or oxazepam may be utilized.
