This is a narrative review of several models of whole-person care and studies that illustrate the business case for whole-person models in primary care. Objectives: To provide an overview of what whole-person care models exist and explore evidence to support these models. Study Selection: Representative whole-person care models widely used in the United States are summarized and evaluated. Selected studies focused on outpatient primary care with examples from programs that integrate the delivery of conventional medical care, complementary and alternative medicine, and self-care within the context of social and cultural environments. Methods: Pubmed search conducted December 2020-February 2021. Two iterative searches using terms for \"Whole Health Veterans Administration\", \"integrative medicine\", \"integrative health\", \"complementary and alternative medicine\", and, as they related to the outcomes, of \"health outcomes\", \"cost-effectiveness\", \"cost reduction\", \"patient satisfaction\", and \"physician satisfaction\". Additional studies were identified from an initial search and the authors' experience of over 50 years. We looked for studies of whole-person care used in general primary care, those not using a single modality and only from United States practices. Results: A total of 125 (out of 1746) studies were found and met our inclusion criteria. We found that whole-person models of primary care exist, are quite heterogeneous in their approaches, and routinely report substantial benefits for improving the patient experience, clinical outcomes and in reducing costs. Conclusions: Evidence for the benefit of whole-person care models exist but definitions are quite heterogenous and unfocused. There is a need for more standardization of whole-person models and more research using whole systems approaches rather than reductionistic attempts using isolated components.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-06-30", "cleaned_text": "The Case for Whole-Person Integrative Care [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57070677](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57070677) [The Future )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-medicina-57-00677), [2](#B2-medicina-57-00677)]. In other words, the application of reductionism results in a focused attempt to control or remove the disease\u2014to cure\u2014rather than to restore the organism to optimal functioning\u2014to heal. [3](#B3-medicina-57-00677)] In his article we review some of these \"whole person approaches\" and evaluate their impact on the main outcomes desired in health care\u2014clinical outcomes, experiences of care, and costs. 2. A Whole Person [4](#B4-medicina-57-00677)], Victor Frankel who demonstrated the importance of meaning for survival [ [5](#B5-medicina-57-00677)], and George Engel in his landmark work on the biopsychosocial model in biology and medicine [ [6](#B6-medicina-57-00677)]. 3. Examples of Whole-Person Models 3.1. Optimal Healing Environments [7](#B7-medicina-57-00677)]. [Figure 1](#medicina-57-00677-f001)illustrates this model. Several health care systems have used this framework for their operations and reported improved patient experience [ [8](#B8-medicina-57-00677)]. In addition, a comprehensive review of the business case benefits of this approach is published [ [9](#B9-medicina-57-00677)]. 3.2. Total Force Fitness [10](#B10-medicina-57-00677)]. [Figure 2](#medicina-57-00677-f002)shows this model. TFF went beyond a medical environment to include physical, psychological, spiritual, social, and even economic aspects of human flourishing, integrated into a single framework and data collection system. This model sought to use a comprehensive whole-person framework for use in health care, as well as prevention and readiness within a military context. Multiple offshoots of this framework documented its value and are being applied in clinical settings such as the \"Performance Triad\" [ [11](#B11-medicina-57-00677)], in entire communities such as \"Operation LiveWell\", and the latest and most sophisticated version applied to the entire enterprise called the Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) Program [ [12](#B12-medicina-57-00677)]. This program \"recognizes that readiness depends on the proper combinations of physical fitness (such as strength, speed, and endurance) and foundational health (such as the cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, and hormonal systems), which are optimized through careful attention to nutritional readiness, mental readiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness\". HF2 aims to track the total health and function of a person in real-time to optimize function, not just treat disease. 3.3. Whole Health [13](#B13-medicina-57-00677)]. This approach starts with the mental and spiritual dimension, asking patients \"what matters\" to them in their life\u2014their meaning and purpose\u2014and then capturing 10 areas of behavior, lifestyle, and social support to create a \"personal health plan\" based on those assessments. Recent research on the outcomes from this model has found significant improvements in all major areas and will be reported on later in this review. [Figure 3](#medicina-57-00677-f003)illustrates this model. 3.4. Integrative Health [14](#B14-medicina-57-00677), this approach. 3.5. Advanced Primacy Care [16](#B16-medicina-57-00677)]. Briefly this model begins with the basic transaction with the patient, the encounter, and the therapy, but then surrounds that transaction with three additional circles of care that enhance or enable whole-person care. In the first circle are the components of the Starfield model of primary care that includes first contact, comprehensive and continuous care. Then, a second circle using enhanced management systems for care is provided to better integrate care delivery. This circle includes chronic disease management, enhanced care coordination, pharmacy services, and the integration of mental health. The fourth and final circle brings in support for lifestyle change and CAM and a process for addressing the social and economic determinants of health. Integrative health has a role in supporting behavioral and lifestyle determinants. [Figure 5](#medicina-57-00677-f005)illustrates this model. [17](#B17-medicina-57-00677), [18](#B18-medicina-57-00677)] and added one additional aim (provider experience) to the analysis. The Triple Aim includes: (1) health improvement; (2) experiential outcomes in the form of patient satisfaction; and (3) cost reduction outcomes in the form of lowered costs per capita. 4. Materials and Methods 5. Results [Table S1](#app1-medicina-57-00677)for a list of the studies reviewed. 5.1. Evidence for Better Health Outcomes [19](#B19-medicina-57-00677)]. Whole Health is a relationship-focused \"approach to healthcare that empowers and equips people to take charge of their health and well-being and live their life to the fullest\" [ [20](#B20-medicina-57-00677)] and incorporates self-care and complementary and integrative health approaches [ [20](#B20-medicina-57-00677), [21](#B21-medicina-57-00677)]. [20](#B20-medicina-57-00677)]. This evaluation also assessed the impact of Whole Health opioids use and on overall pharmacy costs. WHS users with chronic pain had larger decreases in opioid doses than veterans who received usual care. Decreases were largest in veterans who used more WHS [ [20](#B20-medicina-57-00677)]. [22](#B22-medicina-57-00677)]. Specifically, those who participated spent less time at work impaired, had better sleep, less fatigue and pain, more consumption of vegetables and physical activity, and improvements in self-reported quality of life (SF-12 in general health items, physical component, and mental component) and improvements in depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and mental wellbeing (measured by WHO-5, PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores) [ [22](#B22-medicina-57-00677)]. [23](#B23-medicina-57-00677)]. Other studies of health coaching demonstrate improvements in medication adherence. A non-blinded, randomized control trial of health coaching (n = 224) versus usual care (n = 217) demonstrated an increase in self-reported medication adherence, 10% improved concordance of reported medications compared with documented medications in the medical record, and a 17% decrease in medications listed in the medical record that were not reported by the patient [ [24](#B24-medicina-57-00677)]. An Integrative Health coaching program for individuals with Type 2 Diabetes focused on individuals' purpose in life and goals as a motivator for behavioral change. In a randomized control trial (n = 56), participants received 6 months of telephone coaching or usual care. Those receiving Integrative Health coaching had improved medication adherence, self- reported health, and improvements in hemoglobin A1c [ [25](#B25-medicina-57-00677)]. 5.2. Evidence for Improved Patient Satisfaction [26](#B26-medicina-57-00677)]\". They believe that an approach that uses CAM and conventional medicine together is better than either alone [ [26](#B26-medicina-57-00677)]. Veterans at VA sites piloting the Whole Health System of care reported higher ratings of patient-centered care for discussing care goals and less difficulties in care with their provider [ [20](#B20-medicina-57-00677)]. The University of Arizona Integrative Health Center study results demonstrated that all patients (100%) reported that their practitioners treated them with respect. On a 10-point scale (1 = worst and 10 = best), 89% of patients rated overall satisfaction between 7 and 10 and 93% of patients rated trust in their practitioner between 7 and 10. Almost all patients (97%) would recommend the program to others [ [27](#B27-medicina-57-00677)]. [28](#B28-medicina-57-00677)]. [29](#B29-medicina-57-00677)]. These outcomes were a marked improvement over the more reductionistic, disease treatment approach taken for patients before the Nuka system was put in place. 5.3. Evidence for Lower Cost [19](#B19-medicina-57-00677)]. Although medication costs increased across the board, the increase in drug costs was 4.1% lower for those who participated in WHS [ [19](#B19-medicina-57-00677)] than those not enrolled in Whole Health. Drug costs increased less for comprehensive WHS users than for veterans who received usual care. Comprehensive WHS users had at least eight visits including both core WHS and complementary and integrative health services. In veterans with mental health conditions (PTSD, anxiety and/or depression), annual increases in drug costs were 3.5% for comprehensive WHS users compared with 12.5% for veterans who received usual care. In veterans with chronic conditions, annual increases in drug costs were 5.3% for comprehensive WHS users compared with 15.8% for veterans who received usual care [ [20](#B20-medicina-57-00677)]. [30](#B30-medicina-57-00677)]. Claims analysis after 7 years demonstrated that compared to conventional medicine IPA performance, AMI's members had 60.2% fewer admissions, 59% fewer hospital days, 62% fewer outpatient surgeries and 85% lower pharmaceutical costs [ [31](#B31-medicina-57-00677)]. [32](#B32-medicina-57-00677)]. [33](#B33-medicina-57-00677)]. The multicenter Diabetes Prevention Program for patients with prediabetes showed that lifestyle changes delayed development of diabetes and reduced incidence more than the drug metformin. Those in the lifestyle group had an 11-year delay and 20% lower total incidence of developing diabetes compared to a 3-year delay and 8% lower total incidence for those taking metformin compared to conventional care alone. The cost of lifestyle changes to society was about $8800 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved [36](#B36-medicina-57-00677)]. 5.4. Evidence Clinician Experience [20](#B20-medicina-57-00677)]. Employee turnover at Southcentral Foundation, which provides relationship-based, whole-person care for Native Alaskan people, decreased by 15% from 2007 to 2015 [ [29](#B29-medicina-57-00677)]. [38](#B38-medicina-57-00677)]. Foundations in Integrative Health piloted a 32-h online competency-based interprofessional course in integrative health and evaluated results for 214 providers who completed the course. These providers had statistically significant improvements in their resiliency, changes in several wellness behaviors such as days engaged in an activity to manage stress, personal mind-body spiritual practices (breathing, spiritual rituals, and personal reflection), moderate, 30-min daily exercise, socializing with friends, and doing hobbies [ [39](#B39-medicina-57-00677)]. 6. Discussion [Table S1](#app1-medicina-57-00677)). There is no unified theory for whole-person care. Dimensions of what constitutes a whole person varied in different models, and they often had differing emphasis or strategic steps in their application, some using diet as major focus while others using mind-body approaches, for example. More work needs to be done to synthesize and simplify these models into more coherent systems. This might be done by studying the underlying mechanisms of healing, independent of looking at specific treatments for specific outcomes as is done in reductionism. Two lines of research may help improve this situation. [40](#B40-medicina-57-00677)]. The release of underlying healing processes by these mechanisms occurs across multiple conditions, irrespective of the modality or treatment being used. Thus, it is non disease specific and non-reductionistic. This research area may allow for are more complete understanding of whole-person healing and the integration of ancient traditional, complementary, conventional, allopathic, homeopathic or integrative systems, all of which utilize the placebo response. By studying the mechanisms of healing words and rituals, we may get to the core aspects of collective and individual healing across all health care systems [ [41](#B41-medicina-57-00677)]. [42](#B42-medicina-57-00677), [43](#B43-medicina-57-00677)]. This also includes more conventional approaches to healing such as psychotherapy, mind-body practices, and hypnosis in various forms. These are often collectively referred to as \"vitalist\" approaches. Researching these non-instrumental approaches by examining \"healing presence\" and communication processes in the patient-provider encounter could shed light on fundamental processes of whole-person healing and how they work independent of the specific interventions that use a drug, pill, needle or knife linked to a specific outcome. [ [44](#B44-medicina-57-00677)] More research on the impact of these health models is needed. 7.
