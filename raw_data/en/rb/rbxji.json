Our intention is to provide information thatis practical as well as technically and operationally sound. For readers whowould like to explore topics in greater depth, we have provided additionalreferences. In revising EPI Essentials , we have tried to listen to readers' feedback, which was generally very positive. Users very much appreciated having such avariety of practical information in one compact volume; the user-friendlyformat with many photos, forms, tables, and quotations; the accessible writingstyle; and, at times, the authors' provocative attitude. USAID decided to revise the earlier volume because it had long been out of print and because, over the past 15 years, immunization programs haveundergone a number of significant changes. These include new objectives(e.g., accelerated disease control for polio, measles, and neonatal tetanus),new vaccines (e.g., hepatitis B and Hib), new procedures to solve old prob-lems (e.g., injection safety), new technologies for vaccine delivery and coldchain, and health sector reforms. Such changes underscore the need for con-stant attention, sharing of experience, creativity, and flexibility in respondingto problems. A central theme is that there is not just one way of doing things. We provide managers and other decision-makers with scientifically based principles, poli-cies, and standards; technical specifications for vaccines and equipment; andoperational considerations that they must weigh to devise the best solutions fortheir circumstances. We have drawn on real life experiences to illustrate howtechnical and operational issues can be addressed in the field. In addition to technical changes, immunization has been subject to boom and bust funding cycles, which are mirrored in fluctuations in coverage rates anddisease transmission. We see a need to use the boom times to build strongmanagerial capacity, stable funding commitments, and a wide base of sup-port for the task required to be done year after year for the foreseeable futureto protect every child in every country.8 Immunization EssentialsWe view the provision of a primary series of vaccines in the first year of life (often called \"routine immunization\") as the cornerstone of all immunizationefforts and other primary health care efforts as well. The fact that immuniza-tion gives each child five contacts with the health system before the age ofone year is a tremendous opportunity that is often underutilized. While thenecessity for \"routine immunization\" for every birth cohort remains constant,immunization programs are anything but static. Decentralization, integration,and other changes in primary health service delivery pose a continual chal-lenge, and public health personnel must be ever vigilant to make sure that thetremendous promise of immunization is sustained. While the impact of immunization on childhood morbidity and mortality has been great, its full potential has yet to be reached. Millions of children still diefrom vaccine-preventable diseases each year. It is our fervent hope that thismanual will assist those responsible for immunization programs to meet thischallenge. The protection of children, a task every immunization worker takeson every day, is a high calling. If this manual can make that task a little easi-er, then the effort to prepare it has been worthwhile.9 Immunization EssentialsAcknowledgements Technical Writing Group: Murray MacNeil, Sarah Melendez Technical Reviewers: Reviewers were sought for the breadth and scope of their technical expertise and a wide range of perspectives.

He made two small cuts on thearm of an eight-year-old boy, JamesPhipps, and inserted material takenfrom a sore on a woman infected withcowpox, a mild disease common todairy workers. Six weeks later, Jennerinjected the boy with fluid from asmallpox lesion, and James did notcontract smallpox. With this experiment, Jenner discovered that inoculation ofa person with relatively harmless disease material could protect the personfrom a more dangerous disease. He called this process \"vaccination\", derivedfrom the Latin name for cowpox, vaccinia.

Indeed, vaccina-tion has become one of the most important preventive health care interven-tions of all time. Every year millions of children and adults receivevaccinations that protect them from a host of infectious diseases; meanwhile,the arsenal of vaccines is growing rapidly through bio-medical research. Immunity Immunity is the ability of the body to tolerate material that is indigenous to itand eliminate material that is foreign. The immune system is comprised oforgans and specialized cells that protect the body by identifying harmful sub-stances, known as antigens, and by destroying them by using antibodies andother specialized substances and cells. There are two basic ways to acquirethis protection - active immunity and passive immunity. Active immunity is provided by a person's own immune system. This type of immunity can come from exposure to a disease or from vaccination.Active immunity usually lasts for many years and often is permanent. Passive immunity results when antibodies are transferred from one person or animal to another. The most common form of passive immunity occurswhen a fetus receives antibodies from his or her mother across the placen-ta during pregnancy. Other sources of passive immunity include bloodand blood products, immune or hyper-immune globulin, and animal anti-toxins. Passive immunity disappears over time, usually within weeksor months. Live microorganisms or antigens bring about the most effective immune responses, but an antigen does not need to be alive for the body to respond. Types of Vaccine Live attenuated vaccines are derived from disease-causing viruses or bac- teria that have been weakened under laboratory conditions. They will grow ina vaccinated individual, but because they are weak, they will cause either nodisease or only a mild form. Usually, only one dose of this type of vaccineprovides life-long immunity, with the exception of oral polio vaccine, whichrequires multiple doses. Inactivated vaccines are produced by growing viruses or bacteria and then inactivating them with heat or chemicals. Because they are not alive, theycannot grow in a vaccinated individual and therefore cannot cause the dis-ease. They are not as effective as live vaccines, and multiple doses are17Immunization Essentials Chapter 1: Introductionrequired for full protection. Booster doses are needed to maintain immunity because protection by these vaccines diminishes over time. Inactivated vaccines may be whole-cell or fractional. Whole-cell vaccines are made ofan entire bacterial or viral cell. Fractionalvaccines, composed of only part of a cell,are either protein- or polysaccharide-based. Polysaccharide-based vaccines are com- posed of long chains of sugar moleculestaken from the surface capsule of thebacteria. Unless coupled with a protein,pure polysaccharide vaccines are generallynot effective in children under the age oftwo years. This coupling process is knownas \"conjugation.\" Recombinant vaccines are produced by inserting genetic material from a disease-causing organism into a harmlesscell, which replicates the proteins of the disease-causing organism. The pro-teins are then purified and used as vaccine. Vaccines used in national immunization programs in developing countries are described in detail in Chapter 12.Types of Vaccine Live attenuated - Virus, e.g., oral polio vaccine (OPV), measles, yellow fever - Bacteria, e.g., BCG Inactivated Whole - Virus, e.g., inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)- Bacteria, e.g., whole-cell pertussis Fractional - Protein-based - Subunit, e.g., acellular pertussis- Toxoid, e.g., diphtheria and tetanus - - Pure, e.g. meningococcal - Conjugate, e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Recombinant , e.g., hepatitis B Credit: Aventis Pasteur18Immunization Essentials Chapter 1: IntroductionDisease Transmission and the Impact of Immunization An infectious disease is an illness that occurs when an infectious agent istransmitted from an infected person, animal, or reservoir to a susceptible host.Some of the factors that influence transmission include: Contagiousness of the infective agent Duration of infectivity Disease fatality and attack rate Route of transmission (e.g. person-to-person, vector-borne, water or food-borne) Nature of the vector Population density and size Nutritional status Hygiene and sanitation Access to clean water Poverty Population immunity A basic concept of public health is that every individual who is protected from a disease as a result of an immunization is one less individual capable oftransmitting the disease to others. Individuals who have been immunized serveas a protective barrier for other individuals who have not been immunized,provided that the number immunized has reached a certain level. Reachingand maintaining that level, which varies by communicable disease, provides\"herd immunity\" to unimmunized individuals. Credit: WHO19Immunization Essentials Chapter 1: IntroductionThe figure above illustrates the concept of herd immunity. It shows two hypo- thetical populations in which each individual comes in contact with four othermembers of the population. Both populations have been exposed to a hypo-thetical disease that is 100% contagious. The first group has no immunity tothe disease and, therefore, the disease spreads to everyone. The second population is partially immune due to vaccination services that have protected 75% of the population. Even though only 75% are immunebecause of vaccination, the disease does not spread to all of the remaining25% of susceptible individuals. This is because some of the remaining sus-ceptibles are protected by the fact that they do not come in contact with aninfected individual. This is how herd immunity can protect more people thanthose who actually receive vaccinations and thus inhibit the spread of dis-ease. Note that if the susceptible individuals are unevenly distributed, e.g., ifthey cluster in urban slums, the level of protection in that population will need to be higher to prevent transmission. CONCLUSION In this hypothetical population consisting of only susceptible individuals, the diseasecan spread through the population expo-nentially, eventually infecting everyonebecause everyone will come in contactwith an infected individual.CONCLUSION In this hypothetical population where 75% of the population has been immu-nized, some non-immunized and suscepti-ble individuals (as shown by the greencircles) will not become infected becauseof the fact that they will not come in con-tact with an infected individual.Therefore, the growth rate of the infectionis held in check with only a 75% immu-nization coverage rate. Good immunization coverage can also protect the unvaccinated Adopted from: Fine, 199420Immunization Essentials Chapter 1: IntroductionThe Global Effort to Immunize All Children In the 1970s, at the end stage of the global campaign to eradicate smallpox, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Expanded Programmeon Immunization (EPI). Coverage for basicvaccines was an estimated 5% in developingcountries at that time. The EPI goals were toensure that every child received protectionagainst childhood tuberculosis, polio, diphthe-ria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles by the timehe or she was one year of age and to givetetanus toxoid vaccinations to women to pro-tect them and their newborns against tetanus. During the 1980s, national immunization programs in developing countries made sub-stantial progress in meeting the EPI goal, with the support of WHO, theUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID), the Italian government, and other partners. EPI and theprogram to control diarrheal diseases were the \"twin engines\" that poweredchild survival programs worldwide. As immunization coverage in developingcountries soared, EPI was helping lay the foundation for other primary healthcare services. By 1990, average reported coverage for the six antigens wasover 70%. As a result of the increase in coverage, the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases began to fall dramatically. EPI Logo. Credit: WHO Reported DTP3 Coverage by WHO Region, 1980 - 199921Immunization Essentials Chapter 1: IntroductionIn the 1990s, coverage leveled off and even declined in some countries. There were a number of reasons why it proved difficult to maintain themomentum of the early EPI years. When coverage peaked in 1990,many believed that the job was finished and turned their attention to otherimmunization activities such as vertical disease eradication programs. Somedonors became fatigued with immunization altogether and, noting the declin-ing incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, shifted their resources to otherhealth priorities. Another factor was that the remaining unimmunized childrenwere primarily the hard-to-reach children with whom routine health servicesgenerally had little or no contact. Furthermore, health sector reform and structural adjustments diverted attention away from maintaining effective preventive services in many countries and,in some cases, created confusion regarding where the responsibility for immu-nization resided within the health sector. Whatever the reasons, the result wasa declining investment in training, equipment, logistics, and communications. Global Estimated Deaths Occurring and Prevented, 2000: Measles, Neonatal Tetanus and Pertussis Despite the slowdown of progress in the 1990s, over two million deaths were prevent-ed in the year 2000 as the result of measles, pertussis, and tetanus immunizationsalone (see graph). Clearly, however, the job is far from complete: approximately800,000 children die each year from measles, 400,000 from pertussis, and 200,000from tetanus. 22Immunization Essentials Chapter 1: IntroductionThe deteriorating situation in the 1990s sounded alarms in the public health community, and at the turn of the century, governments and their partnersbegan to renew their commitment to routine immunization services. Newcoordination and funding mechanisms were set up. Most noteworthy was theformation of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), whichsupports immunization efforts worldwide. GAVI is a coalition of governmentsand international, bilateral, and private-sector partners with the purpose ofhelping countries strengthen immunization services and introduce new andunderutilized vaccines. The lessons of the 1980s and 1990s and the new opportunities put forth at the turn of the century have set the stage for great strides in nationalimmunization programs. Realizing the potential of immunization requires acommitment from a broad coalition of partners. That coalition involves every-one from the village health worker to the research scientist, from the nationalEPI manager to the global policy maker, from the donor agency health officerto the Minister of Health. If these partners can work together in coordinatedstrategies that give appropriate attention to all the essentials of immunization, then the world's children will face a much safer and brighter future. Overview of Immunization Essentials This guide describes what is necessary to administer potent vaccines to chil- dren and women in a safe and effective manner on a continual basis.Immunization services must be provided and used throughout the year, everyyear, to enable each new cohort of newborns and women of childbearingage to become adequately protected. Developing and managing systems todo this requires attention to many program details, which are described in thechapters that follow: Chapter 2: Immunization Program Management Roles of the public and private sectors, organization of immunization services,personnel required, donor coordination, global partnerships, communityparticipation, and the impact of health sector reform Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization Services Immunization schedules, organizing routine services, why people usethese services, strategies for increasing use, and supplementalimmunization strategies23Immunization Essentials Chapter 1: IntroductionChapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information Management Using information to record, monitor, and evaluate services, to raisecoverage, and to reduce drop-out rates; tools to support these objectives Chapter 5: Vaccine Supply and Quality Forecasting vaccine needs, vaccine wastage, procurement, andquality assurance Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logistics Storing, handling, and distributing vaccines and other commodities; essential equipment and procedures; and transportation management Chapter 7: Injection Safety Assessing safety, developing the policies and practices to promote injection safety, managing waste, and selecting appropriate equipment Chapter 8: Disease Surveillance Planning and implementing surveillance activities for disease control andadverse events Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior Change Determining feasible actions for parents, health staff, and others to enhanceimmunization programs; developing comprehensive strategies to promote andfacilitate those behaviors Chapter 10: Costs and Financing Mobilizing resources, options for financing, costing and budgeting, and usingresources efficiently and effectively Chapter 11: New Vaccines and Technologies Introducing new vaccines and technologies into existing programs; new vac- cines and technologies in the pipeline Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Details on vaccines used in developing country programs, the diseases they prevent, and disease-specific strategies for their controlReferences Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases .

Consequently, whether they think in terms of \"systems\" or not,their decisions and activities can strengthen the system or weaken it. This hap-pens because most functions in the health system are shared among programsand services \u2014 personnel, budgets, facilities, equipment, supplies, transporta-tion, logistics, supervision, and more. Changes in one activity ripple throughthe whole system. Priorities, organization, and resources differ among health systems. In recent years, many health systems have faced pressure to improve efficiency, raisequality, and increase access to services, while simultaneously reducing costs.The experience of health sector reform has underscored the extent to whichthe health system affects, and is affected by, the political, economic, andsocial environment, as shown below. Clients, health workers, and health offi-cials interact in numerous ways among themselves and with the political struc-ture. As voters or members of the community, clients can provide the criticallink between the health system and the political environment. Good health is good politics 28Immunization Essentials Chapter 2: Immunization Program ManagementThe Public and Private Health Sectors Public Sector The public health sector includes ministries of health, public hospitals, and government health facilities at the local, district, other sub-national, andnational levels. Public health officials formulate policies, standards, and guide-lines for national immunization programs. They monitor immunization cover-age and disease incidence. They are responsible for ensuring that allimmunization service providers, including those in the private sector, complywith the national immunization schedule, maintain the vaccine cold chain,practice injection safety, and follow other policies governing equity and quali-ty. Health personnel from the public sector provide the majority of vaccinationservices in most developing countries. Private Sector The private sector includes non-governmental and for-profit components. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are nonprofit groups that provide curative and preventive health services directly and/or support gov-ernment-provided services. They range in size and scope from small religiousor community-based organizations to large international groups with hundredsand even thousands of employees. A traditional strength of NGOs is their ability to reach people that lack access to public-sector services. Many NGOs have good relationships with people inthe communities they serve and involve community members in planning andsupporting activities. People often regard health services provided by NGOsas being of higher quality than those provided by the public sector. In some countries, involvement of health-focused NGOs in immunization pro- grams is limited, largely because they do not have access to vaccines andimmunization equipment. On the other hand, their extensive involvement inprograms like Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), in whichthey manage drugs and supplies and provide services, indicates that givenadequate support, NGOs can contribute to immunization. 29Immunization Essentials Chapter 2: Immunization Program ManagementNational immunization programs can take advantage of NGOs' experience and appeal by encouraging their participation in: Organizing and providing immunization services directly, although the government should always be responsible for ensuring that NGO servicesadhere to government policies, norms, and standards. Supporting public-sector services with in-kind assistance (e.g., transporta- tion, lodging, and meals), financial support, or technical support (e.g.,cold chain equipment, maintenance, and repair). Mobilizing the community to demand and preparing the community to receive immunization services. Reporting cases of vaccine-preventable diseases and tallies of vaccina- tions that NGOs provide. For-profit providers consist of individuals and organizations that provide services or products for monetary gain. For-profit service providers includeprofessionally-trained health workers, traditional practitioners, private hospi-tals, and clinics. This sector also includes manufacturers and sellers of pharma-ceuticals, health products, and equipment, as well as companies that providelaboratory services, fleet management, equipment repair and maintenance,training, and other services. Vaccination services offered by these private providers are available to those who pay for them. People who are unable to pay and who are often most atrisk of vaccine-preventable diseases must be reached by the public sector, ifthey are reached at all.

Setting policies andstandards at the central level helps to ensure technical reliability and consis-tent practices throughout their countries. Central-level procurement of somecommodities, particularly vaccines, makes it easier to negotiate lower pricesand to control quality. Staff in local health facilities and district health officesneed to continue to plan and monitor the services that they are responsible for delivering. In 1998, Feilden and Nielsen studied the impact of health sector reform on immunization in two African countries. Based on this analysis, they developeda matrix to help decentralization planners distinguish the immunization servicefunctions that should be retained at the national level from those that, althoughtraditionally a national responsibility, could effectively be located at moreperipheral levels. 31Immunization Essentials Chapter 2: Immunization Program ManagementDistribution of Immunization Service Functions Among Levels Function National level only National and/or other levels Formulating national policies, standards, and guidelinesYes Planning international coordi-nation (e.g., for NIDs) Yes Planning service deliverystrategies National coordinates with otherlevels and disseminates news ofcreative and successful localsolutions.

It is important forgovernment planners and partners to recognize that most of these peoplehave responsibilities in addition to immunization services, so their workloadsmay be heavy. The table excludes personnel who are less directly involved in immunization services, such as health planners, human resource managers, and financialmanagers. The list also excludes members of the community who participatevoluntarily.

Source: Adapted from Feilden and Nielsen, 200133Immunization Essentials Chapter 2: Immunization Program ManagementIn addition to the three levels shown in the table, many countries also have sub-national levels (provincial, regional, or state), but few staff members atthese levels are dedicated solely to immunization services. Even surveillanceofficers who were initially appointed solely to monitor acute flaccid paralysis(AFP) for the polio eradication initiative now are responsible for finding andinvestigating other communicable diseases. Coordination of Immunization Activities \u2014 Inter-agency Coordinating Committees The public- and private-sector individuals and groups involved in immunizationservice provision or support need to coordinate their activities at all levels.Inter-agency Coordinating Committees (ICCs) have been formed in many coun-tries to respond to this need at the national and, sometimes, other levels. These committees usually include: Ministry of Health staff (e.g., the national immunization programmanager and the director of pre-ventive services) Staff from related ministries (e.g., the Ministry of Finance andMinistry of Planning) Multilateral donors (WHO and UNICEF) International development banks Bilateral agencies (e.g., USAID, Department for International Development [DFID], Japan International Cooperation Agency [JICA]) Non-governmental organizations ICCs work with national and sub-national immunization personnel to assist with multi-year and annual planning and reviews; coordinate financial andother resource needs; and analyze, design, implement, monitor, and superviseimmunization services. One of their most important tasks is to ensure that ade-quate funding is available for immunization services (see Chapter 10). ICCsub-committees are often formed to focus on specific technical issues, such asvaccine supply, logistics, or social mobilization. WHO has developed generic terms of reference for ICCs, which include suggestions for their roles, as shown in the box. Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II \"Many hands make light the work.\"34Immunization Essentials Chapter 2: Immunization Program ManagementICCs work most effectively when a national representative, such as a high- ranking Ministry of Health official, directs them, when roles and responsibili-ties are clearly defined, when opportunities for in-depth technical discussionsare provided, and when all members agree to terms of reference that outlinethese roles and responsibilities. All members should have decision-makingauthority from their own organizations, and the structure should allow for thefrank discussion of even sensitive issues. The structure of the ICC in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), described on the following page, has worked well in that country.The Role of ICCs Technical Development of a national policy framework for vaccines and immunization that gives priority to immunization activities, sets targets, and provides guidelines Sponsorship of periodic in-depth assessments of national immunization programs Advisory body for national strategic plans of action Support for the implementation of strategies Monitoring of service performance; tracking of disease surveillance data Monitoring quality control and adherence to international standards Development of proposals for program support Financial Evaluation of the use of resources Financial planning Mobilization of additional resources when necessary Political Advocacy for increased commitment to immunization at all levels Social mobilization Capacity Building Development of government capacity for managing and delivering immunization services35Immunization Essentials Chapter 2: Immunization Program ManagementThe experience of the DRC Ministry of Health has shown that a number of elements are needed in order for an ICC to be effective: Harmonizing different objectives, priorities, agendas, work plans, and budgeting cycles of different institutions Building an open, inclusive, and collegial partnership among members that resolves conflicts transparently and avoids favoritism Designating a single focal organization to call meetings, draft documents, monitor progress, etc. Fostering continuity in membership by making assignments for two years or longer Communicating frequently Conducting meetings with clear objectives, agendas, time management, meeting minutes, and follow-up Establishing systems of checks and balances Focusing on the long-term development of immunization services (includ- ing financing)Enhancing the Effectiveness of an ICC The ICC for immunization in the DRC was formed in the late 1990s as a unit of a health sector-wide ICC, which has seven sub-committees to address interventions thathave been designated by the DRC government as high priority.

GAVIprovides a forum for partners to agree upon goals,share strategies, and coordinate activities. As of2003, the financial arm of GAVI, the VaccineFund, provides financing to over 70 countries tohelp them reach national and GAVI objectives (seeChapter 10).

Managers at all levels should seek the participation oflocal politicians, religious leaders, community group leaders, and parents inscheduling the days and hours for immunization sessions, organizing out-reach activities, promoting immunization, and monitoring performance.Community members also can help solve specific service delivery problems,as described below. Village Development Councils Improve Immunization Services! The Primary Health Care Center (PHC) in Abba,Nepal, had a refrigerator but no kerosene torun it. The lack of refrigeration for vaccinesmeant that every day a member of the PHCstaff would have to go to the district healthoffice to collect vaccines for the catchment area.In turn, village health workers (VHWs) wouldcome to the PHC every day to collect vaccinesfor use that day in their villages. When vaccineswere not brought from the district to the healthcenter or when VHWs were not able to collectvaccine from the center, fixed sessions were can-celled. Outreach sessions were difficult to sched-ule. The availability of frozen icepacks was alsoa problem. The Ministry of Health could not provide funds for the purchase of kerosene, so Village Development Councils (VDCs) met with PHC and district officials and eventuallyagreed to cover that cost. The PHC now has kerosene for its refrigerator and storesadequate stocks of vaccines. Fixed sessions are held as scheduled, and more outreachsessions are offered. The VDCs participate more actively in planning and monitoringimmunization activities in their areas, and there are indications that coverage isincreasing and the drop-out rate is decreasing. Community participation made the difference.

Thesenever-ending changes affect all aspects of government, including the healthsector. It is imperative that immunization program managers participate in anynational level discussions on the organization and financing of the overallhealth sector. One of the many lessons of health sector reform has beenthat health priorities are notthe same at the national andlocal levels. Indeed, one resultof decentralization in manycountries has been a reduc-tion in support for immuniza-tion and other preventiveservices. District health man-agement teams tend to givehigher priority to curative careand services, such as ambu-lances, that are visible to thepublic and to politicians.Common Elements of Health Sector Reform There is no single formula for health sector reform. Therefore, reforms should beadapted to address the situation in a particular country, taking into account health,economic, administrative, and political factors. Some common elements of healthsector reform that are most likely to affect the management and delivery of vaccinationservices include: Decentralization: moving decision-making authority and resources (financial and human) from the central level to more peripheral levels Integration: not just of services at the peripheral level, but also of management functions (for example, logistics or information management) at central, regional, or district levels Public-private mix and changes in financing: alternative strategies for serv- ice delivery or financing that are intended to increase the funding base for services Source: WHO, 2002 Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II Members of the community share their concerns with local health officials.39Immunization Essentials Chapter 2: Immunization Program ManagementAnother lesson of health reform is that when responsibility for the delivery of health services is shifted from one level of the system (e.g., national) to anoth-er (e.g., district), resources must follow. To ensure that continuous funding isavailable for immunization, some national governments are providing grantsto districts for immunization or primary health care services. Staff resources are as critical as financial resources. Over the coming years, as district health management team members get training and work experi-ence in public health and preventive care, their skills and knowledge shouldbegin to reach the level of their national counterparts. Because these teammembers make budget decisions, they also need to be skilled in assessing themerits of competing demands, setting priorities for allocating and disbursinglimited resources, strategic planning, and dealing with the public. A third lesson of health sector reform is that the same individuals who are given explicit responsibility and authority for managing immunization servicesshould be involved in planning, budget development, monitoring, and evalua-tion, not only for immunization services but also for the overall health sector.Although the adaptation of program management and services to fit local cir-cumstances is necessary, it must be counterbalanced with the need to adhereto technical standards set at the national level. For example, the vaccinationschedule and the appropriate temperatures for vaccine storage should notvary from place to place within a country.40Immunization Essentials Chapter 2: Immunization Program ManagementReferences Alwan, Ala' and Peter Hornby.

Immunization Schedules The schedule recommended by WHO for delivering the primary series ofvaccines to children below the age of one year reflects a balance betweenepidemiology and practicality. Although the approximate ages and intervals WHO's Recommended Schedule for Primary Series of Childhood Vaccinations in Developing Countries Age Vaccines BirthBCG OPV0 Hep B B * Yellow fever*** *Only three doses of hepatitis B vaccine are needed for full protection. Hepatitis B vaccination schedules vary by country. See Chapter 12. **Hib stands for Haemophilus influenzae type b. See Chapter 12. ***In countries where indicated.44Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization Servicesbetween doses in country schedules should not deviate from those that WHO recommends, there is no single schedule that is appropriate for all countries.An understanding of local epidemiology and national policy is needed toadapt the recommended schedule to a given country's needs. In so doing,local experts should keep in mind the importance of limiting the number ofcontacts and reaching children as soon as their immune systems are able torespond to the vaccine. Provision of Routine Immunization Services There are several strategies for the routine delivery of immunization services inor from health facilities. Fixed facility: This refers to the regular delivery of vaccinations in a health facility on specified days of the week and hours of the day. Larger facilitiesmay give vaccinations whenever eligible clients come. Outreach: Outreach is the deliv- ery of services to people whocannot get to health facilities orwho can do so only with difficulty.Trips to outreach sites are usuallycompleted within a day and aremade by health facility staff onfoot or using motorized vehicles,bicycles, or pack animals.Monthly visits provide the mosttimely protection for children,although less frequent visits maybe necessary where distances are far, travel is difficult, or staff resourcesare limited. Rainy seasons or snowy winters may make it necessary toschedule a pre-season and a post-season outreach visit with a gap of severalmonths in between. In some countries, such as India, outreach visits for primary vaccinations that are conducted once, twice, or three times a year are called \"pulseimmunization.\" Mobile strategy: This usually describes trips of more than one day by district or regional health workers for the purpose of delivering services topeople living in remote areas. Mobile teams may spend several days travelingto reach the people. In Nepal, it can take up to ten days of walking from thedistrict center to reach some villages. Credit: Veronique Leger45Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization ServicesIn general, the cost per vaccination is higher when services are provided through outreach and mobile strategies than through fixed services, becausehealth workers spend more time to reach each child and because there aretransportation and per diem costs involved. However, some people cannot bereached in any other way. Why People Use Routine Immunization Services Studies in many developing countries show that the great majority of parentsview immunization as a worthwhile and relatively easy health practice.Childhood immunization only requires parents to take action about five timesin the first year of a child's life and is generally accepted by families andcommunities. This contrasts with other practices, such as exclusive breastfeed-ing, which require repeated and frequent actions on the part of mothers andwhich are sometimes contrary to cultural norms and beliefs. Scheduling immunization sessions to be accessible is only half the battle - people must actually use the services. Research from many countries indi-cates that people will use immunization services at least once if they knowwhat services are offered and where and when they are available. They willreturn if: They know when to come back. They have been treated respectfully. They have confidence that they will receive the vaccinations thatthey come for. We also know why families do not use immunization services. Focusgroup discussions, interviews, andknowledge-attitude-practice surveys ina wide range of countries have consis-tently found that a majority of parentswish to immunize their children butthat many encounter obstacles, suchas those described below. These areoften due to perceived and actualdeficiencies within the health services. Lack of information. Many families lack accurate information about immu- nizations and immunization services. In fact, this is often the primary obstacleto achieving full immunization of children and women who have good access Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II Health workers should be sure mothers know when and where to return for thenext vaccination.46Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization Servicesto services. They do not know when and where immunizations are available or when their next vaccination is due. They often are unaware that if they missa scheduled immunization date,they can still be immunized; so theyshould come as soon as they can. Poor services. Some people receive one or more immunizations,but are unwilling to return becausethey are dissatisfied with the servic-es they have received for such rea-sons as: Long waits Rudeness or insensitivity on the part of health workers Poor vaccination techniques that cause abscesses or other discomfort Unauthorized fees charged by health care providers Unscheduled facility closures Shortages of personnel, vaccines, drugs, or other supplies Time constraints. Making a trip to a health facility with a healthy child may not be the first priority for people with other important things to do. Formany parents, particularly women, collecting and preparing food for dailymeals requires working from dawn to dusk. Others have agricultural work thattakes them far from home, inflexible working hours, other family obligations,or they lack child care. Social, cultural, or political barriers. Many people who live within geo- graphic reach of health facilities do not use them because of social, cultural,or political barriers. Migrants, people from minority ethnic groups, urbansquatters, and illegal residents often try to avoid contact with any publicauthority. People will not return to health facilities where they feel unwelcome. Misinformation. False beliefs or malicious rumors also keep people from using services. Common misconceptions include the following: Children are safe from vaccine-preventable diseases because a religious or supernatural being protects them. Children are fully protected because they have received some immunizations. Sick children cannot be vaccinated. Immunizations commonly cause sterilization, disease, or dangerous side effects. Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II47Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization Services Vaccinators would come to their homes or communities if the vaccinations were truly important because they have done so before during immuniza-tion campaigns. Distance. Some people simply do not live within reach of health services. Some of these people live in permanent communities, and others are on themove (e.g., nomads and seasonal migrants). Strategies for Increasing the Use of RoutineServices The reasons why people never use immunization services or stop using them after one or two encounters differ from place to place, but most strategiesfocus on one or more of the following goals: Reaching the unreached Reducing drop-outs Limiting missed opportunities Reaching the Unreached In many countries, geographical barriers are not the only \u2014 or even the primary \u2014 reason why people are not vaccinated. Access is also impededby inconvenient scheduling, lack of information, and lack of opportunities \u2014problems that can be solved relatively simply by improving scheduling, raisingawareness, or expanding outreach. Improvements in scheduling. Immunization sessions should bescheduled to be convenient forparents. Health facility managersshould assess their facilities' immu-nization schedules at least once ayear and change them if necessaryto reflect the current needs of thecommunity. Both epidemiologicaland practical considerations areimportant. For example, holdingsessions less often than once permonth may delay protection, butoverly ambitious schedules maykeep health workers from perform-ing other responsibilities or result in cancelled sessions. For outreach, schedul-ing visits to individual villages every two months instead of every monthpermits health workers to reach twice as many villages. A clear schedule of vaccination sessions can help parents avoid wasted trips. Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II One indicator of good management is the number of vaccination sessions that are actuallyheld compared to the number planned. 48Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization ServicesRaising awareness. Families need to know about immunization services before they can use them. Local health workers play a particularly importantrole in increasing awareness and providing information to the target popula-tion. Individual volunteers and community-based groups can assist in thiseffort, as described in Chapter 9. Improving and expanding outreach. Effective outreach must be well planned, organized, and supported. Vehicles must have fuel and must be ingood condition. Vaccines, sterile syringes and needles, vaccine carriers,icepacks, and other supplies must be available in the right amount, in the rightplace, and at the right time. Inaddition, outreach workers oftenneed per diems. Several strategies can be employed to maximize limited resources andassure continuity of outreach servic-es. Village health days can be usedto reach remote populations threetimes per year with vaccinations,vitamin A supplementation, andother health services. Communitiescan also support visiting teams byproviding work sites, furniture,food, and lodging. These strategies can broaden the appeal of outreach,share costs with other programs, and help avoid overdependence on externalfunding sources. Targeting services to meet urban needs. Although vaccination cover- age rates often appear higher in cities than in rural areas, these figures maymask pockets of much lower coverage in high-risk areas such as urban slums.Reaching unreached populations in urban areas is particularly important epi-demiologically because: Population density increases the intensity of disease transmission. Epidemics occur more frequently in urban than rural areas, resulting ininfection of younger children, more severe illness, and higher mortality. Chains of transmission, particularly of measles and pertussis, often begin in cities and towns and then spread to rural areas. The poor sanitation and poor nutrition found in densely populated slum areas weakens residents' resistance to disease and increases their risk ofsevere illness and death. Credit: WHO49Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization ServicesImproving immunization coverage in urban areas can be complex. In somesituations, the ministry of health,municipal governments, ministry oflocal governments, and NGOs allshare responsibility for managing andproviding vaccination services.Ongoing coordination is needed toensure that policies and standards areapplied uniformly, trained healthworkers are available, and marginal-ized populations that may fall outsideof established jurisdictions, such astransient slum-dwellers, have access toservices. Data on vaccination cover-age and disease surveillance shouldbe collected from all serviceproviders, private as well as public. Urban health facilities, like their rural counterparts, can marshal the help ofcommunity members and local healthteams to identify who is not being reached and to find out why. For example,people who live within walking distance of a health facility may not use itsservices because of lack of information, cultural or physical barriers, orprevious negative experience. Different communication and service deliverystrategies may be needed to reach populations with diverse language, cultur-al, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Planners should take advantage of themany events that are available in urban areas, such as public concerts, sportsmatches, fairs, and religious gatherings, to promote immunization. Reducing Drop-Outs Drop-outs are people who begin the vaccination schedule but do notcomplete it. They have at least periodic access and motivation to useimmunization services, but they stop using them for one or more of the rea-sons described above. With the increased use of expensive vaccines like HepB, Hib, and combination vaccines against multiple diseases, monitoring drop-outs and devising strategies to prevent them merit greater attention. If a childdoes not receive all of the doses required for full protection, the resources thathave been used to partially vaccinate that child are mostly wasted. Many health districts have problems with never-reached segments of the popu- lation and with drop-outs. Because resources are limited, planners have to Credit: Richard Pollard Pockets in urban areas are likely to have low coverage and high diseasetransmission.50Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization ServicesUnderstand the Problem \u2014 Never-Reached or Drop-Outs? District A. 50% of children have access to immunization services using DTP1 coverage as an indicator. 42% complete the three-dose series of DTP. Thedrop-out rate therefore 50% - 42% ) x 100= 16%50% In District A, planners should give priority to raising DTP1 coverage by reaching the 50% of children who have never been reached. Reducing drop-outs would, at best,result only in a gain in DTP3 coverage from 42 to 50% . District B. 85% of children have received DTP1. 58% complete the three-dose series. 58% ) 100= 32%85% In District B, reaching the last 15% of the population that has never been reached is likely to be labor-intensive and expensive. On the other hand, following up on drop-outs and persuading them to complete the series could raise coverage of DTP3 from58% to 85%. Unless additional information indicates otherwise, District B should givepriority to reducing drop-outs.51Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization Servicesdecide where their efforts will result in the greatest benefit, as shown in the example on the previous page. Drop-out rates can be calculated using eitherabsolute numbers or percentages. Formulas for calculating and monitoring drop-out rates are discussed in Chapter 4. System failures that cause drop-outs, such as vaccine stock-outs orlack of other essential supplies, are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.Techniques for increasing public knowledge and improving the communicationskills of health workers are described in Chapter 9. Limiting MissedOpportunities A missed opportunity occurs whena client, present in a situation in whichvaccinations should be available,does not receive all of the vaccinesfor which he or she is eligible. Missedopportunities delay protection andprolong the risk of getting the disease.The missed opportunity and 30-clustersurveys are good tools for identifyingwhether potential vaccination clientsare being missed and for whatreasons. (See pages 82-83.) Thosereasons are sometimes system related, i.e. health workers do not have suffi-cient quantities of vaccine or the appropriate equipment. More commonly,missed opportunities can be corrected by health workers themselves, asdescribed below. Improve screening. Health workers should check children's and women'svaccination status every time a clientvisits a health facility or outreach site,regardless of the reason for the visit.Sick children should always bescreened for vaccination, as recom-mended in protocols like those forIntegrated Management of ChildhoodIllness (IMCI). Girls and women receiv-ing antenatal and postnatal careshould be screened and, if eligible,vaccinated with tetanus toxoid.Failure to Screen Can Be Fatal While on a visit to a health center inher district, the supervisor talked witha woman whose baby had recentlydied of neonatal tetanus. She wasreceiving weekly treatment for tubercu-losis from a health facility a few hun-dred meters from her home, but notonce during her pregnancy had shebeen screened for tetanus toxoid. Thiswas the second baby she had lost toneonatal tetanus. Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II52Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization ServicesVaccination cards are of primary importance in determining eligibility for vaccination and in avoiding missed opportunities. Health workers shouldadvise the mother to bring vaccination cards every time she visits the healthfacility for any reason. Health facility registers also can be used to identifychildren who are due for a vaccination. Vaccination cards, registers, andother methods of record-keeping are described further in Chapter 4. Give all vaccines due. Some studies have found that health workers fail to give from 30 to 40% of the vaccinations that are due at the time of clients'visits. For example, a nine-month-old child may be givenDTP and OPV but not measlesvaccine, despite being eligiblefor all three vaccines. This oftenreflects a belief on the part ofhealth workers or parents thatgiving too many vaccines atonce will harm a child, when,in fact, vaccines are as safeand effective in combination asthey are individually. Somehealth workers mistakenly delaythe measles vaccinationbecause they believe that it mustbe the last vaccination given tothe child. Sometimes, missed opportunities reflect an organizational problem. For exam- ple, a mother arrives at a busy session, and a health worker or volunteerchecks her child's card and determines that the child is eligible for DTP3,OPV3, and measles vaccine. The health worker gives the child DTP3 andreturns the card to the mother, assuming that the mother will go to a nearbytable for the next vaccination. Instead, the mother leaves the facility thinkingthat she is finished. The child's card shows that three vaccines have been Job aids can help remind health workers how to administer vaccines correctly. Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II Contraindications and Precautions While vaccines offer significant benefits for most individuals, there are rare situations where vaccination is not recommended. Contraindications and precautions identify cir-cumstances when vaccines should not be given. Contraindications are conditions inthe recipient that greatly increase the chance of a serious adverse reaction. Precautions are conditions in the recipient that may increase the chance of an adverse reaction or may impair the ability of the vaccine to produce immunity. Most contraindi-cations and precautions are temporary, so the vaccine may still be given once the con-dition passes. Since contraindications and precautions vary by vaccine, health workersare strongly advised to understand the appropriate restrictions for each vaccine and toscreen recipients carefully.53Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization Servicesgiven that day, but the child has received only one. Eliminate false contraindications. There are few true contraindications to vaccination. Children with low-grade fever, a cold, diarrhea, vomiting, orother mild illness can safely and effectively be vaccinated. Prematurity, lowbirth weight, and breastfeeding are not reasons to withhold a vaccination. It isparticularly important that malnourished children be immunized because theyare much more likely to die from a vaccine-preventable disease than well-nour-ished ones. Over the past several years the need for clear policies regarding vaccination of children with HIV infection has been recognized. WHO recommendationsfor vaccinating children with HIV infection are summarized in the box below. Vaccinating in the Presence of HIV Policy makers and program staff must address the difficult question of vaccinating children with compromised immune systems. Live attenuated vaccines are a particularrisk because the vaccines can cause a form of the disease, and children with weak-ened immune systems may not be able to fight off even a mild infection. This risk,however, must be balanced against the threat of the disease that the vaccine isintended to prevent. Such diseases can be very severe in HIV-infected children. The problem is that most infants who have been infected with the HIV virus do not show symptoms, and it is difficult to know if they should be excluded from vaccination.With respect to the vaccines that may present the greatest threat to HIV-infected chil-dren, WHO recommends the following: BCG -BCG should be given to all infants, even if their mothers have HIV, unless the infant shows HIV/AIDS symptoms, which is highly unlikely. Since testing infants for HIVbefore they are vaccinated is generally not feasible, virtually all newborns shouldreceive BCG. This practice will protect HIV-positive and -negative children who are at high risk of exposure to tuberculosis because their mothers are HIV-infected. OPV -In highly HIV-endemic countries, as in other countries, individuals without HIV/AIDS symptoms should be immunized with OPV according to standard schedules. Measles -Measles can be very severe in HIV-infected children. WHO currently rec- ommends that an early dose be given at six months followed by the scheduled dose atnine months to children who are known to be infected with HIV. For children with AIDSdisease, the potential risks and benefits must be evaluated on an individual basis. Theoverall risk of adverse events from the vaccine is relatively low compared with the riskof measles infection in HIV-infected children. Children should not be screened for HIV antibody status before receiving measles vaccine. Yellow fever -Yellow fever vaccinations should not be given to patients with sympto- matic HIV infection nor to pregnant women. These are WHO policies concerning vaccination and HIV at the time of the prepara- tion of this field guide. The reader is strongly advised to check the most current policythrough WHO. 54Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization ServicesBecause both health workers and parents may hesitate before vaccinating a sick child, some countries have issued policies on contraindications, such asthe one shown below. Policy on Immunizing Sick Children 1. Recent studies in Kenya have shown that one of the biggest obstacles to achieving full immunization in children is the failure to immunize sick children. 2. Controlled, scientific studies have shown that vaccination of sick and malnourished children in Africa is both SAFE and EFFECTIVE. 3. Babies of low birth weight should be immunized according to the standard KEPI schedule as long as their weight at the time of immunization exceeds 2000 grammes. 4. MOH and KEPI policy advocates the administration of vaccines to all eligible children, including those who are ill. This policy is included in KEPI training materials. 5. There are no contraindications to immunization. All children admitted to hospital must be screened and if they are eligible for immunization, should receive it upon admission. * 6. No child should be discharged from hospital without receiving all the vaccines for which he or she is eligible, based on age and vaccination status. Sick children should not be denied their right to protection against vaccine-preventable diseases. They are in greatest need of thisprotection. 7. The immunization status of every child coming for health services should be checked, regardless of the service being sought, and immunization should be provided to all eligible children. 8. Many diseases may have similar presentation. Therefore, the child should be immunized regardless of whether the mother says the child has already had the disease. This is especiallytrue for measles. 9. All children should be properly screened to ensure that they receive every vaccine for which they are eligible, based upon their age. Parents should be encouraged to bring their children for immunization despite illness. Health workers should not deny immunization to sick or malnourished children.

Health workers often hesitate before opening vaccine vials for one or a few clients for fear of running out of vac-cines before the next delivery. Governments need to set policies on when toopen multi-dose vials and whether opened vials can be used in subsequentsessions (see page 92). Health workers, in turn, need guidance on applyingthe policy, taking into account such factors as: The size of vaccine vials available The frequency of immunization sessions The likelihood that the parent will return for the vaccination another time Supplemental Immunization Strategies Supplemental strategies are used to reach children who have not been vacci- nated or have not developed sufficient immunity after previous vaccinations.Strategies differ according to the epidemiology of the disease. Some of thecommon features are: the target age group is expanded, all children are vac-cinated regardless of their immunization status, immunizations do not need tobe marked on vaccination cards, volunteers are used, and civil society ismobilized. Examples include polio national immunization days (NIDs) andmeasles campaigns. Supplemental immunization strategies should not replaceroutine services. Accelerated Disease Control Accelerated disease control strategiesdiffer by disease. For polio, popula-tion immunity levels must be increasedquickly in order to interrupt chains ofpoliovirus transmission. In the fewremaining polio-endemic countries,NIDs are held two or more timesannually to vaccinate everyone in thetarget population (usually children under five years of age) in a one- to- three-day period. In non-endemic countries with low population immunity, NIDs areneeded approximately every three years. In addition to NIDs, polio eradication planners use sub-national immunization days (SNIDs) and even local immunization days (LIDs) to reach children whowere missed in previous campaigns and are not reached by routine services. With respect to tetanus, supplemental immunization activities also focus on high-risk areas; however, they cannot interrupt transmission because tetanus isnot a contagious disease. (See Chapter 12.) Credit: Ellyn W. Ogden/USAID Using local transport to move vaccine.56Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization ServicesCatch-up campaigns for accelerated measles controlare conducted during aperiod of several days or wide geographicareas. Follow-up campaignsare held after catch-up cam-paigns to reach narrower age range. Measles catch-up and fol- low-up strategies provide a\"second opportunity\"because in thetarget population are includ-ed, regardless of immuniza-tion status. For those who were missed before, such strategies provide asecond opportunity to be vaccinated. For those who were vaccinated earlierbut failed to develop immunity, these strategies provide a second opportunity tobe immunized. (See the measles section in Chapter 12 for more information.) Door-to-Door Vaccinations The door-to-door, or child-to-child, strategy is sometimes used as asupplemental immunization strate-gy to reach families that are notserved at health facilities andother collection points. At least two visits to the same area may be necessary: the firstto map residences, enumerate thetarget population, and publicizethe approaching visit, and the sec-ond to provide vaccinations andperhaps other services. Evenwhen going door to door, healthworkers must make a specialeffort not to miss sick children,sleeping children, very young infants, children who are visiting, and children on upperfloors of apartment buildings. The door-to-door strategy can be effective, but it is also expensive in terms of human resources, transport, and other costs. Credit: Daniel Cima, American Red Cross Credit: WHO Children receiving vitamin A during measles campaign.57Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization ServicesMop-up strategies are used occasionally when control activities have suc- ceeded in reducing the incidence of disease and in containing the diseasegeographically, but some children still remain unreached. These activities oftentarget high-risk children who live in poor urban areas, hard-to-reach ruralareas, and areas with transient populations. Mopping-up requires intensivevaccination efforts, including door-to-door visits. As in other supplementalimmunization activities, screening is not required. Outbreak Response When an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease occurs or is suspected,managers must decide whether an immediate vaccination campaign is war-ranted and, if so, which populations to target. Target populations for suchcampaigns are people who are at risk in terms of both age and location.Decisions about target groups, age range, geographic scope, and type andduration of response activities should be based on local epidemiological data. Outbreak control must be timely to be effective. Although vaccination cam- paigns during outbreaks are almost always appropriate for yellow fever andother diseases with relatively slow transmission, many countries cannotrespond in time to halt faster-moving diseases like measles. Nevertheless, gov-ernments can provide information, treatment, rehabilitative care, and inmeasles outbreaks, vitamin A supplementation. If the response includes vacci-nation campaigns, health and other public officials should explain that peoplemight already be incubating the disease when they are vaccinated and there-fore may get the disease despite being vaccinated. To respond quickly, staff from local facilities and district, regional, and even national offices often have to participate. Local health workers may offer vac-cinations at their own facilities or through outreach visits, and mobile teamsmay go to remote areas. To be effective, outbreak control must be timely. Special Populations Refugees and people in other emergency situations are often more susceptibleto infection because of unsettled conditions, lack of services, population move-ments, and crowded living conditions. Measles poses a particular risk in emer-gencies because measles case fatality can be as high as 50%. Therefore, theminimum immunization target should be to rapidly reach all children up to 15years of age with measles vaccine and vitamin A supplementation.Campaigns to vaccinate people in emergencies can prevent outbreaks andmay also supplement routine immunization services, as shown in the exampleon the following page.58Immunization Essentials Chapter 3: Delivery of Immunization ServicesProtecting Refugees against Disease All children in refugee camps in Macedonia who were younger than 48 months of age were targeted for immunization against eight vaccine-preventable diseases. Threemass campaigns were carried out in three consecutive months in seven camps, achiev-ing coverage ranging from 73% to 91%. After the first campaign, weekly immuniza-tion clinics were established in every camp. These achieved an average of 93%coverage. Although many individuals were vaccinated, planners were disappointed because: The campaigns did not begin until weeks after the refugees arrived, which could have resulted in outbreaks. The constant turnover meant that many children did not complete the schedule for vaccines requiring more than one dose. Source: Koop, Darryl G. B.M. Jackson, and G. Nestel.

How many individuals in the target population are being vaccinated, who is not being vaccinated, and why. Whether the quality of services meets program standards. Whether resources are used efficiently. Whether service strategies are meeting objectives. Whether mortality and morbidity from vaccine-preventable diseases are being reduced. Policy makers, political leaders, health planners, donors, providers of techni- cal assistance, and members of the general public also need information. Thischapter describes systems, methods, and tools for the collection, analysis, anddissemination of information on coverage, drop-outs, and quality of services.(Collection and use of data for disease surveillance are discussed in Chapter 8.) Health Information A good information system avoidsover-burdening health-care workers bylimiting the information they need tocollect and record to that which ismost essential for program manage-ment and assessment. The followingquestions can help information systemdevelopers distinguish toknow\" from \"nice to know\" data: Time To Tally? A nurse in East Africa reported: You have mothers waiting for you.You have children waiting for you.You have curative waiting for you.You have antenatal waiting for you.You have family planning waiting for you. It is very difficult to rushback and tally.\" Source: GAVI, 2001\"62Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information Management What do we (all of the interested parties) need to know? Why? How will people at various levels of the system use the data, including health workers, supervisors, community members, and managers? Does the use of the data justify the work and expense involved in their collection, collation, and analysis? Which indicators are most likely to tell us that we are progressing or having problems? How will we collect, collate, and analyze data? How, when, and to whom will data be reported? How will we monitor the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of reports? How will we provide feedback to interested parties? Health information systems generally focus on collecting patient names, recording treatment or visit dates, and counting the number of events. Thesedata are not sufficient, however, to allow managers to evaluate services andmonitor changes over time, for example, disease incidence, patient character-istics, or the impact of health interventions. To do this, managers need infor-mation that is: Relevant Specific and quantitative Understandable Sensitive to changes and trends To limit the time, effort, and cost involved in collecting, collating,and analyzing data, plannershave to restrain the commonimpulse to add informationitems. At the same time, theymust ensure that the items thatthey choose provide the information they need to make program decisions. For immunization programs, coverage and drop-out rates are used as indica- tors of the availability, accessibility, and use of services, as well as of otherprogram characteristics. As the name implies, an indicator describes one ormore aspects of services and shows only that there may be a problem. A mixof indicators, as shown in the table, should be used to get a more completepicture of services and to identify problems that should be investigated.

Generally not available from routineservice statistics. Information can usually be derived from population-based surveys analyzed byWinCOSAS or other software. Absence of vaccination cards limits the reliability of this indicator. The definition of FIC may vary among countries.64Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementGovernments, organizations that provide technical assistance, donors, and community leaders use indicators such as those listed above to measurewhether they are achieving their objectives and to make strategic decisionson resource allocation. For example, some community-based health commit-tees use DTP3 coverage as an indicator of the performance of all publichealth services in their communities. GAVI uses DTP3 coverage by district asan indicator of progress toward its goals. Managers also use indicators to assess quality, efficiency, effort, and impact. Some examples are given below.

This is true despite the fact that many havebeen available for years. The most important of these are maps, patient regis-ters, vaccination cards, tickler files, tally sheets, and immunization monitoringcharts, each of which is described below. Maps In addition to geographical distributionof cases (see Chapter 8), maps canshow access to services, particularly inrural areas. For example, local mapscan show population distribution inrelation to the location of healthfacilities. Maps should indicategeographical features (e.g., mountainsand rivers) and infrastructure (e.g.,roads and bridges), because theseare important considerations forimproving access. Patient Registers Most health facilities use a patient register to record information about every person who comes to the facility for any health-related reason - preventive orcurative, outpatient or inpatient. For immunization, registers are used to identi-fy children who are due for a vaccination, to monitor missed opportunities, tocheck the accuracy of reporting, and to target case investigations. At a minimum, a patient register should include: the day, month, and year of visit; the patient's name; the patient's address; the patient's birth; and asummary of services provided, including vaccinations given and dose number. Another way to organize the immunization register is to set aside one or more pages for each month of the year. When a child comes to the facility, a healthworker records the child's name on the page for the month of his or her date ofbirth. As vaccinations are given to that child, they are recorded on the sameline in the register. Some health facilities keep special immunization registers. At the end of every month, health workers review the register to identify the children who have notreceived the vaccination or vaccinations for which they are eligible and thenfollow up with these children. For example, children should have a measles Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II Hand-drawn maps posted where they are to be used can be helpful in planning.66Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information Managementvaccination at age nine months. At the end of each month, health workers should make a list and follow up on children born more than nine months ear-lier who did not yet get their measles vaccinations. Vaccination Cards Vaccination cards and other home-based records enable parents and healthworkers to monitor an individual child's progress toward full immunization.Families keep these records of childhood and tetanus toxoid vaccinations toremind them which vaccinations and doses have been given, which have not,and when vaccinations are due. These cards may be the only records healthworkers have of vaccination history and status if patient registers are not wellmaintained or for clients who have moved from another health facility. A vaccination record may be a separate document or part of a general child health card. Regardless, it should include the child's name, date of birth,address, a parent's name, and the date of each vaccination by dose. Ageneral health card rein-forces the importance oftaking advantage of allhealth contacts and missingno opportunities to providepreventive services; thisapplies whether a childhas come for an immuniza-tion and needs growthmonitoring or a womanhas come for vaccination.

Credit: WHO, 200367Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementThere is reliable evidence that clients generally value and retain their cardsand that, if reminded, they will bringthe cards to the health facility at eachvisit. However, the cards' meaningand possible utility is not always rec-ognized. Before any new card isintroduced, health workers and repre-sentative families should be asked toassess how well they can read andunderstand everything on it.Managers should make sure thathealth workers have adequate sup-plies of cards; many health facilitiesfail to issue them because there arenone available. It can be difficult to interpret the infor- mation on vaccination cards withoutassistance. Oral reminders may beneeded to communicate information,particularly to people with poorreading skills. When new vaccines are added to national immunization programs,changes to the old cards may berequired. To avoid the expense andeffort of revising the card, programsmay leave a space in which towrite additional vaccines as theyare introduced. Tickler Files Tickler files are boxes in which copiesof children's vaccination cards or sim-ilar records are filed according to themonth when each child's next vacci-nation is due. For example, when achild comes to a health facility andreceives a vaccination card, a health Do They Understand the Card? A recent study of 600 mothers in one country revealed that many could notunderstand basic information on theirvaccination card. A reading test was first given to all mothers. Those who could read (490of 600) were asked to look at a \"typi-cal\" card filled out by researchers. Only 49% of the literate mothers could say how many immunizationsthe child received during the lastvisit. Only 45% could tell when the next immunization was due. Only 44% could identify which vac- cines the child had alreadyreceived. Source: CHANGE Project, 2002 Credit: Craig Manning Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II68Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information Managementworker writes on the card the vaccine, dose, and date of each vaccination the child receives that day. The health worker makes a copy of the card and filesit in the box behind the divider for the month when the child's next vaccina-tion is due. The cards behind each month-divider are alphabetized by lastname. As children come for vaccinations during the month, their cards arepulled, updated, and moved to the divider for the month when the next vacci-nation is due. At the end of each month, cards remaining behind the divider for that month represent drop-outs. Health workers then plan strategies to ensure that each ofthese children receives the vaccinations that are now overdue. Tally Sheets Tally sheets are forms on which health workers make a mark every time they administer a vaccination. These are used as a basis for reporting to the districtlevel. Supervisors use them to monitor the accuracy of reporting from healthfacilities to districts.

Children under oneyear and over one year of age are recorded separately in order to accuratelycalculate coverage in children under one. This tally sheet also enables healthworkers to specify which dose of tetanus toxoid was given and whether thewoman to whom it was given was pregnant at the time. (In most developingcountries, pregnant women are the target population for tetanus toxoid.) Aspace is provided to record whether children receiving DTP1 were protectedat birth from neonatal tetanus. Immunization Monitoring Charts Every health facility that offers immunization services needs to monitor progresstoward coverage objectives. Providing tools such as monitoring charts andensuring that health workers have the skills to use them can motivate healthworkers, enhance performance, and improve the quality of data. The information on the following page explains how to complete andinterpret a monitoring chart. Immunization monitoring charts should be posted in every healthfacility for inspection by health facilitystaff, clients, and supervisors. Thecharts can be shared with politicaland community leaders. Determining Tetanus Protection at Birth If the number of valid doses already received is:And the last dose received was: Last born child must be consid- ered as: 0 Not protected 1 At any time Not protected 2 Less than three years before last birth Protected 3 Less than five years before last birth Protected 4 Less than ten years before last birth Protected 5 or more At any time Protected Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II70Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementSTEP 3: Record vaccine doses per month Two vaccines given at different ages are selected, such as DTP1and DTP3. The number of vacci-nations recorded on the tallysheet is written in the box for thatmonth under the graph. STEP 2: Enter yearly and monthly coverage objectives In the monitoring chart, a printed diagonal line goes straight from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. This repre-sents regular progress over a 12-month period toward a cover-age objective of 100%. In this example, the objective has beendivided evenly across 12 months, and each monthly objective isshown as a percent on the left side of the table and as a num-ber on the right.STEP 1: Estimate size of target population The target population for childhood immunizations is all children under one year of age. The target popu- lation for tetanus toxoid is pregnant women. If the actual number of pregnant women is not available, thenumber is assumed to be the same as, or slightly higher than, the number of children under one year. In some places, health workers can ask community leaders for help in counting children under one year of age and pregnant women in their catchment area. STEP 4: Calculate the cumulative and annual totals and drop-out rates Every month, the total for that month is added to the previous month's cumulative total and recorded in the monitoring chart, in the box labeled Total. At the same time, the monitoring chart is marked with adot that represents the cumulative total, and the dots are connected. STEP 5: Interpret and use the informationWhen the drawn line is on or above the printed line, the facility is on track to meeting the coverage objective. When the drawn line is below the printed line, the facility is not on track. After several months, the monitoring chart will begin to show whether progress is being made toward the objective, and any slippage below the target can be corrected in the following months by exceed-ing the target. The difference between the printed and drawn line for DTP1 in the example above maybe used as an indicator of the unreached population. The space between the two drawn lines for DTP1 and DTP3 is the visual equivalent of drop-out. As of September in the example above, the facility is experiencing approximately 30% drop-out. It is not ontrack to reach the coverage target, but it can still take action in the next three months to catch up.Example of Completing and Interpreting a Monitoring Chart71Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementSuch charts provide a visual reminder of both the overall immunization objec- tive and a gauge of the facility's progress in achieving it. If all goes well, thechart could also foster a sense of accomplishment. Analysis and Use of Routine Data The data that health workers collect should be used by the health workersthemselves and by their supervisors, managers at all levels, and communityleaders to monitor performance in general and, specifically, to monitor immu-nization coverage and the drop-out rate. Immunization Coverage Immunization coverage is the proportion of the target population that hasbeen vaccinated. The difficulty of calculating and interpreting immunizationcoverage rates often stems from problems related to estimating the size of thetarget population. These, in turn, are the result of inaccurate or outdatedSample Self-Monitoring Chart for a Health Post It has been shown that if service providers under-stand such information,they can use it to guideaction to improve immu-nization coverage. Inorder to accomplish this,data should be present-ed in a way that is use-ful to health workers andunderstandable by com-munity members. This isan example of a com-bined tally sheet andmonitoring chart thatmight be used byperipheral health work-ers with limited arith-metic skills. In thisexample, the healthworker did an annualhead count in the com-munity and identified340 children less than12 months of age. Dotsare filled in to representdoses of vaccine given.They are counted andcompared against quar-terly targets as shown inthe glasses of water(cylinders). The level of water is hand-drawn each quarter. Based upon thetally sheet below the glass, thehealth worker and the communitycan clearly see that only 90 chil-dren have been vaccinated withDTP1. Despite 6 months of activi-ty, the glass is only one-quarterfull. Children are being missed.Each cir-cle six monthsof the year.72Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information Managementcensus counts, population migrations, and unforeseen changes in birth ratesor infant mortality. At the end of the month, health staff add the daily tallies of vaccinationsand convert them into a percentagecalled coverage. The box belowshows three examples of the annualcoverage rate by vaccine. The secondbox shows how to estimate the num-ber of surviving infants for use in cal-culating coverage rates. Calculating Annual Coverage for DTP1, DTP3, and Measles Vaccines for 2003 DTP1 coverage: by 12 months with DTP1 in 2003 number of surviving infants <12 mos. of age in 2003 DTP3 coverage: number immunized by 12 months with DTP3 in 2003 number of surviving infants <12 mos. of age in 2003 Measles coverage: number immunized by 12 months with measles vaccine in 2003number of surviving infants <12 mos. of age in 2003 Example of Estimating the Number of Surviving Infants Total population: 5,500,000 Crude birth rate (CBR): 30/1000Infant mortality rate (IMR): 80/1000Number of surviving infants = Total population x CBR x (1-IMR) = 5,500,000 Credit: Lauren Goodsmith Immunization chart in Morocco. x 100 x 100 x 10073Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementIf coverage rates indicate that people are not using immunization services, health workers and their supervisors need to find the causes and take appropri-ate action. Comparing coverage rates for different vaccines sometimes pointstoward the likely problem as well as possible solutions, as shown below. Drop-Out Rates High drop-out rates may reflect problems in demand for vaccinations, client satisfaction with services, and the ability of the immunization program to pro-vide those services. To calculate drop-out rates, the number of doses of anytwo antigens administered at different ages are needed, for example, measles, DTP1 circumstances, drop-out rate of 10% or less is considered acceptable,although full immunization is always the goal.

After DTP1 vaccination, remind parents that three doses are neededand when to bring child for DTP2and DTP3. 74Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementHealth workers should investigate the reasons, determine the solutions, and take action when drop-out data indicate a problem. Supervisors, communityleaders or other interested community members should also be involved. To facilitate monitoring and use of drop-out information, health facility staff can use and post a chart to monitor drop-outs. INSTRUCTIONS: A. Enter the monthly total of DTP1 immunizations given to children below the age of one year. B. Enter the cumulative total of DTP1 immunizations given. Cumulative includes the current monthly total plus the monthly totals for all of the previous monthsduring the year. C. Enter the monthly total of DTP3 immunizations given to children below the age of one year. D. Enter the cumulative total of DTP3 immunizations given. E. Subtract the cumulative total for DTP1 from the cumulative total for DTP3. This is the cumulative total number of drop-outs for DTP1 to DTP3 for the year. F.

In this example, drop-out rates between DTP1 andmeasles were monitored. Because their drop-out rate is higher than the 10% national target, health workers should try to determine the causes for the drop-out so that they can correct the problemin the months remaining in the year. Credit: Mark Weeks, BASICS II76Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementOther Uses of Data In addition to their use in monitoring performance and progress toward objec- tives, routine immunization data may be used to track the implementation ofpolicies and to justify budget requests. Monitoring the implementation of policies. In Kyrgyzstan, managers used data on contraindications to identify a problem and then used the samedata to track the impact of a new policy. Monitoring and feedback providedevidence of improvements in the application of the policy and a resultingincrease in coverage. Justifying budget requests. Health reform and decentralizationhave increased the need to advo-cate for immunization services atthe district level, where budgetarydecisions are increasingly beingmade. Active monitoring andsharing of a few indicators oncoverage, drop-outs, and otherdata can be used to mobilizecommunities, determine strengthsand weaknesses in health servic-es, attract political support, andjustify funding requests. Monitoring the Use of Contraindications Health workers throughout Kyrgyzstan keep immunization records on every child. Included in these records is the number of times that children were denied vaccinationsbecause of contraindications. For years, these data were ignored, but when they werefinally examined, managers realized that health workers were applying unnecessarycontraindications that left many children unprotected. The Ministry of Health issued a policy to clarify the use of contraindications, but health workers continued to use invalid contraindications. Then supervisors in one district were specifically asked to monitor the percentage of eligible children who were denied a DTP vaccination because of contraindications. Asthe study began, a very high proportion (28%) of children was being denied vaccina-tions because of contraindications. When staff at all levels became aware of the mag-nitude of the problem, they took action. Twelve months later, failure to immunizebecause of contraindications had declined to less than 5%. Expanded throughout Kyrgyzstan, the monitoring approach succeeded in reducing contraindications nationwide to less than 5% annually. Source: Weeks et al., 2000 Constellation of Activities77Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementRoutine Reporting By a specified date at the end of every month, designated staff members at each health facility should report to the district level. These reports should pro-vide a summary and analysis, not simply a collation of all of the data thatfacilities collected during the month. District health management teamsusually need coveragedata for all vaccinesby dose. They mayalso ask for data onother aspects ofimmunization services,such as amount ofvaccine used anddisease incidence. A team at WHO's Africa Regional Office developed the monthly reporting form shown here,initially for use in West Africa. The form is designed for the national level, butmanagers have found that it can be adapted easily for district use. District health management teams aggregate the data from all health facilities in their district, then send the aggregated figures to the next administrativelevel, and so on, until the data reach the national level, where they are collat-ed into a national coverage report. The Joint Reporting Form is submitted by15 April of each year to WHO Regional Offices and to WHO and UNICEFheadquarters, which publish the information in a joint annual report. Monitoring the Information System Supervisors and managers can monitor a health facility's informationsystem by: Checking the patient register: Is it complete and up to date? Checking vaccination cards: Are there enough in stock? Are they complet- ed properly and up to date? Do the holders of the cards understand theirpurpose? Reviewing the immunization monitoring chart: Is it on the wall of the health facility? Is it up to date? Can health workers in the facility explainwhat it means? 78Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementCompleteness and timeliness of reporting can be tracked on a chart that lists the units from which monthly reports are expected and the dates when thereports are actually received. Accuracy of reporting, as well as completeness and timeliness, should be monitored. Inflating or deflating performance levels in reports can be temptingwhen benefits seem to be associated with certain outcomes. Innocent mistakescan also occur. To make sure that data are accurate, users should rely on theirknowledge of the area, their experience, and even their intuitions about\"funny numbers,\" i.e., numbers that are unexpected, that stand out in someway, or that otherwise don't make sense. Some true examples of funny num-bers from the field are described in the box. Giving health workers the tools and skills to use data to assess their own per- formance can improve staff motivation, strengthen performance, and improvedata quality. Self-assessment through a process of active, continuous monitor-ing at each level should always be encouraged.\"Funny Numbers\" for Immunization Coverage Coverage over 100%? Example 1: For six months in a row, one health center recorded immunization cover- age that exceeded expectations. Upon investigation, health workers realized thatclients were coming to their center from another catchment area where vaccine short-ages were common. These individuals had not been included in the denominator usedto calculate coverage. Example 2: Health workers included children over 12 months of age in calculating coverage for their routine reports. This inflated the numerator for the coverage equa-tion, and since the denominator included only children under 12 months of age, thehealth facility's coverage often appeared to be above 100%. Higher DTP3 than DTP1? Last year 51 of the 110 districts in the country reported higher figures for DTP3 thanDTP1. National staff found that, during a catch-up campaign, health workers classifiedall DTP vaccinations as DTP3 without checking whether individuals had received DTP1or DTP2. Variations among Health Facilities As of May, most health facilities in the country were reporting 30% to 40% cumulativemeasles coverage, which is approximately what one would expect. One center, how-ever, reported 100% coverage. This center had conducted a measles vaccination cam-paign in their catchment area to prevent a predicted outbreak and had inappropriatelyincluded the vaccinations given during the campaign in its routine reports.(Vaccinations given during campaigns should be reported separately and not includedin routine reporting.)79Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementThe final step in monitoring informa- tion systems is to provide feedback tothe data collectors. Such feedbackcan include assessments of data quali-ty, data from other facilities, andreports of actions taken at district andhigher levels, as well as guidance forlocal action. Evaluation An evaluation can be a comprehensive study of the whole health system, a service or program within the system, or a single function, such as the coldchain, disease surveillance, or training. Like monitoring, evaluation shouldlead to action. Unlike monitoring, which is carried out continually, evaluationis periodic. Evaluations should answer the following kinds of questions: What do clients, health workers, managers, and/or other stakeholders think about the service or specific aspects of it? What do they like? Whatdo they dislike? Were stated objectives achieved? How? Which inputs led to improvements and which did not? Were there any unintended, positive outcomes? What were they? How can they be replicated? How efficiently were activities implemented? Were the outcomes worth the cost? Which strategies should be continued? How can they be improved? What was the impact of the service on organizational or national goals? Health service evaluations usually focus on outcomes (e.g., changes in immu- nization coverage), processes (e.g.,vaccine delivery), and/or client sat-isfaction. Impact evaluations, whichexamine the effect of activities ongoals such as reduction of morbidi-ty and mortality, are less commonbecause of the difficulty in sortingout variables and determiningcause and effect relationships.Measuring impact is time-consumingand requires significant Keiser Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II80Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information Managementare needed periodically to show whether activities have made a difference in the health status of the population. Unfortunately, the results of evaluations are often not used to the extent they could be to improve programs. One solution is participatory evaluation, whichenables key stakeholders to participate in designing, planning, and executingthe evaluation. Interpreting Coverage from Different Sources Immunization coverage rates are usually estimated based on routine (adminis-trative) figures that are derived from tally sheets filled in at the health facility.In addition, population-based surveys conducted periodically for specialpurposes also serve as a source of data for estimating coverage. Survey datamay tell a different story from routine data, so managers and other users need Comparing Immunization Coverage Rates from Different Sources In this instance, the two sources of data that cover approximately the same time period are the routine EPI data and the Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). Dramatic differ-ences can be seen between these two sets of figures. A careful analysis revealed thatat least one reason for the high coverage rates from routine EPI data is that childrenover 12 months of age were included in the numerator but not the denominator ofthese coverage estimates. The population-based MICS included estimated coverage by12 months of age, and excluded doses given to children over 12 months. Participatory Evaluation A participatory evaluation is a collaborative process that involves the people who willbe affected by decisions based on the evaluation findings. These stakeholders shouldparticipate in planning when and how to evaluate and what methods to use, collectingand analyzing information, and making recommendations. Their participation meansthat the issues that are important to them will be examined, they will learn more aboutthe issues, and they will feel more committed to use the results. Source: Feuerstein, 1986 81Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information Managementto be able to figure out which data are most suitable to use in a given situa- tion. The data in the box on the previous page from one African country high-light the complexities of coming up with clear figures for estimating coverage. As seen from the example, coverage estimates can vary greatly by the source of data. To make sense of any data, users need to be aware that: The age group and geographic scope can differ among studies or data sources. Some surveys report coverage based only on what is documented by vac- cination cards, while others include data from caretakers' recall. Parents'recall of what vaccines were given to which of their children on whatdates is not always reliable. Some surveys of children 12-23 months of age include the vaccinations that these children received only up to 12 months of age. This is the rec-ommended survey methodology for immunization coverage. However,other surveys include the vaccinations that children received up to the timeof the survey, which means that vaccinations given to children when theywere older than 12 months of age will be included and thereby inflatecoverage estimates. Different data can be used for different purposes. For example, valid, population-based data should be used for estimating the proportion of thepopulation protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. But cruder esti-mates, including those based on routine data, can be used to detecttrends from year to year or to estimate drop-out rates. Not all coverage data can be compared in a constructive way. In the exam- ple, it would be meaningless to compare the Demographic and HealthSurvey (DHS) data from 1997 with 1999 routine EPI data because both thesources of data and the time periods covered are different. Population-based surveys will detect vaccinations provided by the private sector that may be missed by the facility-based tallies used to estimate rou-tine coverage. Indicators are only markers of possible problems. Further investigation is needed to confirm that there is a problem and to clarify its causes so thatgood planning can be done. The Inter-agency Coordinating Committee (ICC), or a technical sub-committee, is an appropriate forum for discussions of such issues. In the example above,the analysis of coverage data was done to prepare the ICC for a multi-yearplanning exercise. 82Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementTools for Assessment and Evaluation Many tools are now available for identifying immunization service delivery problems and determining how best to fix them. National-level healthmanagers, academicians, donors, and international development organiza-tions use these for assessments, evaluations, reviews, coverage surveys, andother purposes. Immunization Services Assessment Guide This guide (sometimes called \"the common assessment tool\") is used toanalyze current services in order to plan program improvements and calculateresource needs. It was prepared by WHO/EPI for adaptation by partners ofGAVI, national immunization programs, and other users. It can be used atthe beginning of a planning cycle or when a change, such as introduction ofa new vaccine, is under consideration. The guide enables users to conducta comprehensive assessment of all levels of immunization services and toexamine their relationship to the health system as a whole. Immunization Coverage Surveys A standard WHO methodology for determining immunization coverage isbased on a survey of small numbers of individuals (210 in 30 clusters of 7individuals each). Homes are visited and immunization records examined tocalculate immunization coverage in children 12 to 23 months of age andtetanus toxoid immunization coverage for mothers of infants. Respondentsare asked to describe their perceptions of immunization services and anyproblems they have had. The surveys use a cluster sampling technique to ensure that data from a small sample of homes can be generalized to a larger population, but these datacan be used only in the aggregate.They say nothing about individualclusters or specific health facilities. A Coverage Survey Analysis System (WinCOSAS) is available for the com-pilation and analysis of data fromcluster sampling surveys. The softwarecan be used to identify: Coverage by 12 months of age and coverage from 12 to23 months of age for eachvaccine dose Coverage Surveys Can Make a Difference! A country in South America refrained from making additional investments inits immunization program becausegovernment officials had acceptedreports from national staff that immu-nization coverage was approximately80%. The government renewed its sup-port when coverage survey datarevealed that coverage was closer to40%.

WinCOSAS software isavailable on the WHO/EPIwebsite. Seventy-Five- Household Survey This method focuses on households that have easyaccess to health facilities.The theory is that if peoplein the 75 to 100 house-holds that are closest tohealth facilities are notreceiving services, then useof services in the widercatchment area must bepoor indeed. This type of survey is valuable because it encourages interactionbetween community members and the health workers who collect the datafrom people at home. It is most useful in areas where the population is stableand coverage unknown. For more information refer to Training for Mid-level Managers: Increase Immunization Coverage , Annex C (WHO). Missed Opportunity Survey A missed opportunity survey assesses whether all clients who were present ina facility offering vaccinations for which they were eligible that day receivedthem. Available from WHO/EPI, the survey includes reviews of coverage dataand patient registers and interviews with clients as they leave health facilities. Credit: Richard Pollard84Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementLot Quality Assurance Sampling This technique is used to assess the quality of service, coverage, or both for the purpose of directing attention and support to the facilities or areas thatneed it most. It is often used in areas that do not correspond to official report-ing sites, such as urban slums. This type of survey addresses a limitation in theimmunization coverage survey technique that does not allow analysis of datafrom individual clusters. For more information, refer to Monitoring Immunization Services Using the Lot Quality Technique (WHO). Large-Scale Population-Based Surveys DHS and UNICEF's Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) are periodic, large-scale, population-based surveys that are good sources of data on nationalhealth sectors and target populations. More information on these methodolo-gies is available from USAID and UNICEF. Computerized Information Systems Computers are used increasingly to track the number of vaccinations adminis-tered and to compute coverage, vaccine in stock, vaccine wastage, diseaseincidence, age of vehicles in use, and other data. Although computerizationcan solve arithmetic errors and perform additional analyses, it does not guar-antee the production of high-quality data or its use. Skilled health workers areneeded in the first instance to collect data and report them accurately, com-pletely, and on time. When considering using computers for immunization data, managers and donors should keep in mind the: Reliability of power supply Adequacy of telephone, Internet, and computer networks Availability and applicability of software Ability to attract and retain competent information system staff Availability of budget for training, maintenance, support, and paper, ink, and other consumables Direct access that trained staff have to computers85Immunization Essentials Chapter 4: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Information ManagementReferences Feuerstein, Marie-Therese. 1986.

To ensure an adequate vaccine supply, managers must competentlyestimate supply needs. Also, regulatory mechanisms are needed to monitorvaccine quality. Forecasting Vaccine Needs Whether the source of vaccine is local or international, managers need toforecast vaccine needs accurately. This involves assessing the impact ofpolicies and plans on vaccine needs, determining the size of the targetpopulation, knowing the amount of stock on hand, setting supply intervals,and calculating reserve requirements. Vaccine use and wastage are alsocritical factors. Vaccine Vial Size and Session Frequency Policies, coverage objectives, and service delivery strategies all have animpact on vaccine needs. For example, increased promotion of routineimmunization services should increase demand, and an adequate supplyof vaccines must thenbe available to meetthat demand. Vaccines come in a variety of presentations, depend-ing on the particular vac-cine, including vialscontaining one, two, five,six, 10, or 20 doses.Managers and suppliersneed to work together toensure that the best vialsize is procured, givenavailability, demand, storage space, transportation capabilities, and cost. Credit: Harvey Nelson88Immunization Essentials Chapter 5: Vaccine Supply and QualityAnother factor is session size. If only a few children typically attend sessions in a health facility, use of single-dose vials might mean that less vaccine wouldbe discarded at the end of a day. However, single-dose presentations (whichare available for measles, Hib, and Hep B vaccines) are considerably moreexpensive per dose than multi-dose presentations. Size of the Target Population The accuracy with which the target population is measured or estimated is ascritical in vaccine forecasting as it is in calculating coverage (see Chapter 4).To increase accuracy, target population figures should be adjusted annually,especially in urban areas where populations constantly change and in ruralareas subject to high migration. Inaccurate or outdated census counts, population migrations, and unforeseenchanges in birth rates contribute todifficulties in determining the size ofa target population. Local healthmanagers may try to overcome suchproblems by working with communityleaders to count people in their catch-ment areas (\"head counts\"), but thisis not easy, as any demographercan attest. In addition to problems in counting people, some managers inflate thesize of the target population to makesure that they receive an adequatesupply of vaccines. In other cases, asdiscussed in Chapter 4, they maydeflate the size to make coveragerates look high! Estimates should begin to improve as supply systems become more reliableand staff are better supported in solv-ing problems, rather than punished forlow coverage rates. As health workersbegin to collect and use vaccine datain which they have confidence, usage,rather than population size, is likely tobecome the preferred basis for calcu-lating vaccine needs. Overestimating the Target Population for Campaigns May Result in Oversupply In preparing for high-visibility cam- paigns, planners forecast vaccinerequirements based on the desire tohave an adequate supply of vaccines.At every level, they tend to calculatetarget population size, coverage objec-tives, and vaccine wastage on the highside to avoid shortages. Sometimesexisting stock balance is not consid-ered, so vaccines are ordered as ifnone were already in the system. Theresult is that after campaigns, therecan be a sizable stock of vaccines atthe district and health facility levels. After campaigns, managers should col- lect excess vaccine, move it to higherand safer levels of the cold chain forstorage, and make adjustments infuture vaccine orders to account for thepresence of these stocks. In addition,campaign planners should use thenumber of children immunized in previ-ous campaign rounds to estimate thetarget for the next. 89Immunization Essentials Chapter 5: Vaccine Supply and QualityStock on Hand The amount of stock on hand should always be counted at each vaccine stor- age point before new stock is ordered. Stock should be kept within designat-ed minimum and maximum levels toensure that: Adequate amounts are available Space is available to store the stock Vaccine is used before the expiry date The duration of storage is consis- tent with recommendations (seeChapter 6) Supply Intervals Another variable in calculating vaccine needs is frequency of supply. Typicalsupply intervals, which should be adapted by each level to account for trans-port availability, cold chain storage capacity and quality, and continuity ofenergy supply, are listed below. Storage Capacity An additional consideration inforecasting vaccine needs is theamount of cold chain storage spaceavailable at each level for vaccines.A vaccine volume calculator has beendeveloped by WHO to help nationalimmunization programs determinetheir space requirements when intro-ducing new vaccines. With this tool,managers can use the national Typical Supply Intervals for Vaccines at Different Levels Level Interval National store Six months Regional stores Three months District stores One month Health centers One month Health posts One week Credit: Craig Manning A vaccine volume calculator spreadsheet is available from WHO.

Reserve Stock Reserve, or buffer, stock is a quantity of vaccine that can be used if new sup-plies are delayed or if there is a sudden increase in demand. Facilities shouldalways maintain a reserve stock, which is typically calculated at 25% of theamount expected to be used during a given supply period. Experience mayjustify a higher or lower amount. To avoid overstocking, the figure should bereviewed and adjusted every time an order is placed. Note that reserve stock is not the same as a wastage allowance. Both are needed in forecasting vaccine needs. Vaccine Use and Wastage Vaccine use and wastage, two sides of the same coin, are also factors in fore-casting vaccine needs. Vaccine use is defined as the proportion of the vaccinesupply that is actually administered to a child or mother. Vaccine wastage isthe proportion of vaccine that is supplied but never administered, calculatedas shown below. Some so-called \"wastage\" is not wastage at all but rather a predictable and acceptable cost of providing immunization services. Common causes ofunavoidable loss of vaccine include the following: It is impossible to get all vaccine out of a multi-dose vial. A 20-dose vial does not yield 20 doses, only 17 or 18. Calculating Vaccine Wastage Formula: doses supplied* - doses administeredx 100 Example: Doses supplied: 200 administered: x 100 = 25% wastage200 * \"Doses supplied\" is calculated from stock records by adding the starting balance of usable vaccine doses at the beginning of a designated period to the new dosesreceived during that period and subtracting the balance remaining at the end of theperiod: Starting balance + doses received - balance remaining = doses supplied91Immunization Essentials Chapter 5: Vaccine Supply and Quality Any immunization session may attract fewer eligible people than anticipat- ed. For example, based on experience, a health worker expects seven oreight children to show up for measles vaccinations in the weekly immu-nization session. The first child arrives and the health worker appropriate-ly reconstitutes the vaccine in a 10-dose vial. By the end of the day, shehas administered measles vaccine to only four other children. The remain-ing vaccine must be discarded. On the other hand, wastage rates higher than 20% can be an indicator of problems that might be avoided, such as: Repeated instances of lower-than-planned attendance at sessions. Poor stock management Cold chain failure that exposes vaccines to unacceptably high or low extremes of temperature Incorrect mixing of freeze-dried vaccine Incorrect dosage, e.g., the administration of three drops of OPV instead of two, or the injection of 0.6 ml of vaccine instead of 0.5 ml Inappropriately large vial sizes. BCG, however, is only available in 20 dose vials. Failure to comply with a multi-dose vial policy Unlike the messy refrigerator on the left, the tidy refrigerator on the right permits better management of vaccine stocks. Credit: WHO92Immunization Essentials Chapter 5: Vaccine Supply and QualityWHO's policy on multi-dose vials is intended to reduce wastage. WHO Multi-Dose Vial Policy Recommendation 1.2.1 The revised policy applies only to OPV, DTP, TT, DT, hepatitis B, and liquid formulations of Hib vaccines that: Meet WHO requirements for potency and temperature stability Are packaged according to ISO [International Organisation for Standardisation] standards Contain an appropriate concentration of preservative 1.2.2 For these vaccines, the revised policy states: Multi-dose vials of OPV, DTP, TT, DT, hepatitis B, and liquid formulations of Hib vac- cines from which one or more doses have been removed during an immunization ses-sion may be used in subsequent immunization sessions for up to a maximum of 4weeks, provided that all of the following conditions are met: The expiry date has not passed. The vaccines are stored under appropriate cold chain conditions. The vaccine vial septum has not been submerged in water. Aseptic technique has been used to withdraw all doses. The vaccine vial monitor (VVM), if attached, has not reached the discard point. 1.2.3 The revised policy does not change recommended procedures for handling vac- cines that must be reconstituted, that is, BCG, measles, yellow fever, and some formu- lations of Hib vaccines. Once they are reconstituted, vials of the vaccines must be discarded at the end of each immunization session or at the end of six hours, whichev-er comes first. Source: WHO, 2000 Credit: Anne B. Keiser93Immunization Essentials Chapter 5: Vaccine Supply and QualityManagers should carefully interpret data that indicate wastage and avoid taking actions to reduce it that could result in a decrease in the number ofimmunizations administered. Calculating How Much Vaccine to Order As discussed above, to calculate the amount of vaccine to order, managers need to know the size of the target population, number of doses in the pri-mary series, expected coverage given the strategies to be used, supplyinterval, and wastage rate. The basic formula for calculating the order sizefor any vaccine is: target population x expected coverage x number of doses of the particular vaccine required x wastage factor The calculation is then adjusted based on the amount of stock on hand and the reserve stock needed, as shown below.Three Ways to Reduce Vaccine Wastage In the early 1990s, approximately half of all vaccines supplied to immunization programs worldwide were never used and eventually had to be discarded. In addition to better stockmanagement and improvements in service delivery, three steps have proven successful inreducing vaccine wastage: 1) The strategic use of smaller-dose vials, when funds and storage space are available.2) Implementation of opened multi-dose vial policies, when training and monitoring are included to ensure compliance. 3) The use of vaccine vial monitors (VVMs), when training and monitoring are provided (see Chapter 6). An Example of Calculating Order Size for DTP Number of doses required Wastage rate Target population = 1000 Wastage rate in this district is 25%.Expected coverage = 70% Wastage factor or multiplier: 100/(100-25) = 1.33 Number of doses per child required = 31000 x 0.70 x 3 = 2100 doses 2100 doses x 1.33 = 2800 doses Number of doses required per supply periodSupply period in district is every 3 months (0.25 of a year).2800 x 0.25 = 700 dosesVaccine in stockThe amount of DTP that is needed in the district for this three-month supply period is 700 doses. If the district already has 400 doses in stock, the amount of vaccine to be ordered is300 doses, not700 doses. It is a common and costly mistake to order vaccine without adjusting for the amount in stock. Reserve stock requiredA percentage should be added for reserve stock. If 25% reserve stock is used, then an addi- tional 175 doses are needed (25% of 700). Amount to order: 300 + 175 = 475 doses94Immunization Essentials Chapter 5: Vaccine Supply and QualityForecasting the requirements for tetanus toxoid (TT) is more difficult than for childhood vaccines because the target population for TT is girls and women,who have approximately 30 years of eligibility, usually between ages 15 to44 years. Furthermore, the intervals between each of the five doses vary. Theprevious year's TT usage will usually provide the best estimate of the currentyear's need, but that figure should be adjusted to the situation. For example, aTT campaign in high-risk areas may increase the demand for TT, while thedemand will begin to decrease when several years of good TT coverageresults in a build-up of protected women. Vaccine Procurement and Quality Assurance Some countries procure vaccines themselves, while others rely on internationalorganizations, particularly UNICEF, that specialize in vaccine procurementand supply. If a country program is directly procuring vaccines, the activityshould be managed at the national level to ensure that standards are main-tained. Procurement is not a simple task, as suggested in the box. Specializedprocurement units should performthese tasks, as described in detail inthe WHO manual Procurement of Vaccines for Public-Sector Programs. WHO's Ensuring Quality of Vaccines at Country Level -Guidelines for Health Staff describes international requirements that national immuniza-tion programs need to follow forshipping, verifying vaccine quality,assessing production, and monitoringthe National Regulatory Authority(NRA). These guidelines also provideinstructions on how to protect vac-cines against dangers like those listedon the following page. A vaccine arrival procedure has been developed to monitor and record thecondition of vaccines upon arrival.This is described in Chapter 6. All countries need National Regulatory Authorities, or control authorities, to monitor the quality of vaccines. NRAs in countries that purchase their vaccinesdirectly from manufacturers are also responsible for:Steps for Procuring Vaccines at the National Level Pre-qualify vaccines and suppliers Prepare for procurement Prepare bid documents Prepare for bid evaluation Solicit and receive bids Evaluate and compare bids Select a supplier Make an award Write a contract Make financial arrangements Set up a contract monitoring system Arrange for and monitor shipment Accept delivery and clear customs95Immunization Essentials Chapter 5: Vaccine Supply and Quality Licensing all vaccines used in the country Establishing procedures for releasing each lot of vaccines used in the country Monitoring adverse events following immunization (AEFI) (see Chapter 8). Access to a laboratory is needed to monitor vaccine quality, whether countries are procuring vaccines from external sources or producing thevaccine themselves. International organizations, particularly WHO and UNICEF, also provide vaccine quality assurance and financing services. Once WHO is satisfied thata producer meets its standards, UNICEF and other United Nations purchasingagencies are advised that they may purchase from this producer. Manycountries also benefit from UNICEF donor funds and procurement serviceagreements. UNICEF also finances the purchase of vaccines - directly or with funds con- tributed by donors. Payment usually is required in advance and must bemade in a convertible currency, unless the government has made otherarrangements. The PAHO Revolving Fund and the Vaccine IndependenceInitiative (VII) both function as payment guarantees in lieu of prepayment forvaccines (see Chapter 10).A Short List of Threats to Vaccine Quality During shipment: Inadequate notice of arrival, scheduling arrival during long holidays, route deviations, en route delays, cold chain breaks Upon receipt: Vaccine quality not checked Central storage: Cold chain breaks, inadequate recording, inadequate stock control system, power failure Release for use: Release certificates from the NRA in the producing country not checked, no formal release system Distribution: Freeze-dried vaccines not distributed with diluents in matching quan- tities, cold chain breaks, freezing of DTP, TT, DT, Td, Hep B, liquid Hib Point of use: Inadequate storage, reconstitution, administration, and disposal96Immunization Essentials Chapter 5: Vaccine Supply and QualityGlobal Vaccine Shortages The supply of the six traditional vaccines was more than adequate to meet demand until the late 1990s. Some manufacturers then stopped producingthese vaccines, and as their availability decreased, prices began to risesignificantly. By 2002, most vaccines given to children and women in developing coun- tries, including the newer vaccines, were in short supply. Reduction in theavailability of some of the traditional vaccines is shown in the graph below. Supplies can be jeopardized if there are significant variations in vaccine production, sizable batch failures during manufacturing, or changes invaccine formulations that requireapprovals and increased manufacturingcapacity. Poor forecasting, inefficientuse, and sudden increases in demandcan add to shortages. Global responsesto shortages include: Providing manufacturers with suffi- cient guarantees that the vaccinesthat they produce will be purchased Making long-term funding available to cover vaccine costs Improving the accuracy of forecast- ing, especially long-termAvailability Versus Demand for Traditional Vaccines Procured Through UNICEF Source: UNICEF, 2002 Credit: BASICS97Immunization Essentials Chapter 5: Vaccine Supply and QualityReferences Schnur, Alan. 2001.

Ensuring that vaccines,supplies, and staff arrive on time and where they are needed requires an inte-grated system of equipment, people, policies, and procedures. This integratedsystem is called the cold chain, and information links its parts. National and sub-national program managers, district health management teams, cold chain technicians, logisticians, drivers, and health facility staffall play a role in getting vaccines from the manufacturer to the point of use.These individuals deal with vaccine stock management, temperaturemonitoring, equipment selection and maintenance, vaccine handling, andtransporting people and vaccines. Vaccine Stock Management Having too much vaccine for too long in one part of the cold chain increasesthe risk of some vaccine reaching its expiration date and having to bedestroyed. In contrast, when too little vaccine is available, not all the childrenand women in the target population can be vaccinated. Too much vaccine inone part of the cold chain may mean too little in another. To be sure that the appropriate amount of vaccine is available, vaccine stocks must be checked continuously, and records kept of all movements of stock inand out of storage areas. 100Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and LogisticsVaccine Arrival The successful arrival of vaccines from international sources requires that programs avoid such problems as: Shipment of vaccines by way of airports that lack cold rooms Consignments to the wrong party Shipment of the wrong vial sizes Shipment of the wrong quantity of vaccines and diluents Shipment of vaccines that are due to expire soon Arrival of vaccines on weekends or holidays Shipment of vaccines without: - Advance notification- Sufficient icepacks- Cold chain monitors - Documentation needed for customs clearance Every international shipment of vaccines from a manufacturer should include a blank vaccine arrival report (VAR) form, as shown on the following page.When the shipment arrives, the individual responsible for monitoring vaccinearrivals and storage fills in the VAR and gives a copy to the local office of theprocuring agency. The report documents the condition of the shipment and thequantities received, and it confirms that all other necessary documentation isincluded. If problems occur, the VAR can be the basis for initiating correctiveaction or making claims. Credit: REACH Project/JSI Staff should be ready to collect the vaccines upon arrival.101Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logistics Source: WHO, 2001Vaccine Arrival Report102Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and LogisticsUse of this WHO-recommended VAR form helps logisticians to identify and document problems at the highest link of the cold chain through which allimported vaccines pass. Problems identified at this level are usually more easi-ly and inexpensively solved. For more information, see WHO's Guidelines on the International Packaging and Shipping of Vaccines (WHO, 2001). Vaccine Stock Records Accurate vaccine forecasting and ordering depends on knowing the quantityof vaccines in stock at all times. Whenever vaccines and diluents enter orleave a storage area, they should be counted. Ordering should be based ona physical count of vaccine stocks rather than on stock records alone. Vaccine stock records, like the one shown above, are used to record thename of the manufacturer of each lotof vaccine, the vial size, the lot num-ber, expiry date, vaccine vial monitorstatus (see pages 106-109), doses ofvaccine received, doses issued, andthe balance remaining in stock. Thistype of card can be used in a stockbook or ledger or as a stock card atany level of the system. To ensure that no vaccine remains too long in storage, stocks should bearranged in order of \"earliest expira-tion date \u2014 first out\" (EEFO) at every Credit: WHO Source: WHO, 2003103Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logisticslevel. This helps ensure that old vaccine stocks are distributed before newer ones and limits wastage caused by expiration. Temperature Monitoring Keeping vaccines at the right temperature is not an easy task, but the conse-quences of not doing so can be disastrous. Once vaccine potency is lost, itcannot be regained. Damaged vaccines must be destroyed, which can leave acountry without adequate vaccine stocks and can cause serious budget prob-lems when the losses involve large lots and/or expensive vaccines. Childrenand women who receive a vaccine that is not potent are not protected. Vaccines have different cold storage requirements, which change at different levels of the cold chain, as shown below. Beer and Vaccines Whenever there is a discussion on immunization service logistics, someone asks why cold beer is available in remote areas but vaccines at the required temperature are not.Of course, beer is a profitable commodity, but more to the point, it does not require con-tinuous cold. In contrast, vaccines can lose their potency if they are exposed to heat, or,in the case of some vaccines, freezing temperatures. Source: WHO, 2003104Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and LogisticsFreezing Vaccines Some vaccines spoil if they are frozen, including DTP, TT, DT, Td, Hep B, and liquid formulations of Hib. The risk is real and the costs may be high. In Indonesia, logisticians used continuous temperature monitoring devices to track 16 shipments of vaccine from the national manufacturer to the point ofuse. Vaccine in 12 of the 16 shipments froze at various points in the coldchain. The biggest risk for freezing occurred during transport from province todistrict with vaccine in 10 shipments affected. Freezing episodes at such ahigh level of the cold chain affect several month's worth of vaccine supplied tomany districts and health centers. In the Indonesian study, vaccine was alsofrozen at district levels within ice-lined refrigerators and in some health centerrefrigerators. The temperature is shown below for one vaccine shipment froma province to a district to a health center. Freezing occurred during storage atboth district and health center levels. New methods to keep vaccines cold without freezing them are being devel- oped and some old practices challenged. For example, using cardboard orpaper partitions in a cold box or carrier to keep freeze-sensitive vaccines from Source: Nelson, 2001Freezing Study Results, Indonesia Extra care and precautions to prevent freezing should be emphasized in training, supervision, and monitoring.105Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logisticstouching icepacks has proven to be ineffective against freezing. During immu- nization sessions, vaccines can be kept cool but should be protected fromfreezing by standing opened vials in a foam pad above the ice packs in thevaccine carrier. \"Shake Test\" The shake test is designed to determine whether adsorbed vaccines such as DTP, DT, Td, TT or hepatitis B have been frozen. Adsorbed vaccines are manu-factured in such a way that one substance attaches to the surface of another To perform the shake test, take a vaccine vial of the same type, manufacturer and batch number as the vaccine vial you want to test. Freeze the vial for at least 10hours at -10\u00b0C until the contents are solid, and then let it thaw. This vial is the \"con-trol\" sample and should be labeled as \"frozen\" to avoid its use for vaccination. Then take a vaccine vial from the batch that you suspect has been frozen. This is the \"test\" sample. Vigorously shake the control and test samples for 10 seconds, placeboth vials on a flat surface to rest, and continuously observe them over the following20 minutes. View both vials against the light to compare the rate of sedimentation. If the test sample shows a much slower sedimentation rate than the control sample, the testsample has probably not been frozen and may be used. However, if the sedimentation rate is similar and the test sample contains flakes, the test sample has probably been damaged by freezing and should be withdrawnfrom use. The health worker must notify the supervisor immediately to ensure thatany other damaged vials are also identified and withdrawn from use. 106Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logisticsmaterial. After freezing, the vaccine is no longer a uniform cloudy liquid, but tends to form flakes that gradually settle to the bottom after the vial has beenshaken. Sedimentation occurs faster in a vaccine vial that has been frozenthan in a vaccine vial from the same manufacturer that has never been frozen. Temperature Monitoring Devices Keeping a record of temperature changes is critically important. Health work-ers should record the temperature of their vaccine refrigerator twice a day on a chart like the one above. The shaded area on the chart represents the tem- perature range that is acceptable, from +2\u00b0 to +8\u00b0C. When they visit healthfacilities, district- and higher-level managers and supervisors should reviewthese charts to emphasize the importance of maintaining appropriate vaccinetemperatures. Recording thermometers that automatically make such record-ings also are available. The numbers in the top row are calendar days. The columns in the second row are divided into morning (M) and evening (E) for recording temperaturestwice a day. Different types of thermometers, thermo-recorders, and chemical indicators are used to monitor vaccine temperatures, as described on the following page. Vaccine Vial Monitors A vaccine vial monitor (VVM) is a small colored disk printed on a vial labelor, for freeze-dried vaccines, placed on the vial cap. A square inside the diskdarkens irreversibly when exposed to heat over time. By comparing the colorof the inner square to that of the outer ring, users can determine the extent towhich the vaccine inside has been exposed to heat.107Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and LogisticsThis is used to monitor temperature during transport and in storage. Itirreversibly records cumulative heatexposures above +10\u00b0C and any exposure over +34\u00b0C. Manufacturers should pack a CCM card or manufacturer-validated monitor in each carton of vaccine shipped. When thesecartons are opened and vials put into smaller boxes for distribution to lower levels ofthe cold chain, the value of the monitor is diminished. The CCM card shown aboveindicates that substantial exposure to heat has occurred. This is an irreversible temperature indicator thatbursts when a shipment isexposed to freezing tem-peratures. The most recentmodel (Product InformationSheet code E6/45) releas-es blue liquid and backing the indicator isexposed to temperaturesbelow 0\u00b0C for more thanan hour. Manufacturers pack these devices with DTP, TT, DT,Td, liquid Hib, and hepati-tis B vaccines. They canalso serve as \"silent super-visors\" in refrigerators.However, they do not indicate whether atdifferentlevels of the coldchain. A combination of a Cold Chain Monitor and FreezeWatch indicator is used tocontinuously monitor tempera-ture range in vaccine refrigera-tors. The heat indicatorirreversibly cumulativeheat exposures of +10\u00b0C orany exposure over +34\u00b0C. Thefreeze component bursts attemperatures below freezing.

For example, a VVM on a vial of OPV, which is the most heat-sensitive of all vaccines used in national immunization programs, will reach its end point within two days of exposure to +37\u00b0C. At the other extreme, a VVM on a vial containing TT, which is very sta- ble, will reach its end point only after 30 days of +37\u00b0C exposure. VVMs have been available on all vials of OPV procured through UNICEF since 1996 and arebecoming available for all other UNICEF-procured vaccines, as well as vac-cines from other sources. Countries that purchase their own vaccines directlyfrom manufacturers should include VVMs in their procurement specifications. When health workers use VVMs correctly, they can: Identify heat-damaged vaccine and discard it Avoid unnecessarily discarding vaccine because of suspected heat exposure Extend accessibility to vaccinations in remote areas beyond the reach of the cold chain Always check the VVM before using the vial. The vaccines in these vials can be used because the inner square is still lighter than theouter ring. Credit: WHO109Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logistics Monitor the amount of vaccine discarded due to excessive heat exposure Identify cold chain problems For these benefits to be realized, national immunization programs have found that they must issue policies authorizing staff to use VVMs; disseminate clearinstructions to public and private health facilities; provide hands-on training inreading and interpreting the monitors; and monitor and provide feedback onVVM use. Selection of Storage Equipment People who are responsible for procuring cold chain storage equipment gen-erally use Product Information Sheets to find out about different types of equip-ment, costs, ordering details, and how to select products. Items in the ProductInformation Sheets are independently tested and must meet product specifica-tions defined by WHO. To simplify maintenance and repair, cold chain equipment managers and donors are advised to procure the same types and models of equipment. The costs of spare parts, tools, repairs, and fuel to run the equipment must not beoverlooked during budgetpreparation. As the pie chartshows, these costs are muchmore significant over a 10-yearperiod than the initial cost to purchase cold chain equipment. Cold Rooms Cold rooms are large, specially constructed rooms or self-containedbuildings located at the national,and in some cases regional, levelfor storage of large quantities ofvaccines. They have a 24-hour tem-perature monitoring system with analarm, a recorder, and a back-up Cost of Cold Chain Equipment over a 10-year Period 110Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logisticsgenerator that will turn on automatically whenthe regular power isinterrupted. Freezers andRefrigerators Freezers and refrigera-tors are used indistrict, regional, and storingcertain vaccines, par-ticularly OPV, thatneed to be kept at temperatures below 0\u00b0C. Other vaccines are stored in refrigerators, which are also used for chilling diluent before it is mixed with freeze-dried vaccine. Ice-lined refrigerators, which are used at the central and sub-national levels, arecapable of maintaining temperatures below +8\u00b0C even when electricity failsfor as many as 16 of every 24 hours, day after day. Factors in addition to price should be considered when selecting cold chain refrigerators and freezers, including: Service delivery strategies. The freezing compartment of refrigerators in health facilities should be large enough to freeze and store icepacks neededfor outreach and fixed sessions. Source of power. Electric appliances are the least expensive to buy and CFC-Free Equipment The Montreal Protocol banned the manufacturing and use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in industrialized countries on January 1, 1996 and in developing countriesbeginning on January 1, 2010. These chemicals have been widely used as refriger-ants in compression refrigeration circuits and as foaming agents for insulating coldstorage equipment. UNICEF, WHO, and equipment manufacturers are working tomake a gradual transition to CFC-free equipment for all vaccine storage and transportpurposes in all countries by 2010. How to dispose of equipment in the course of this transition is a question that has yet to be completely resolved. Credit: WHOStorage of Vaccines and Ice packs in the Refrigerator111Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logisticsthe easiest to maintain, but reliable electric power is not available in many rural areas.Voltage stabilizers are usually needed to avoid damage to com-pressors caused by fluctuations in power. Where electricity is unreliable, gasor kerosene appliances may be the best choice, despite their high costs,maintenance demands, and ongoing need for fuel. Where gas or kerosene delivery is unreliable, solar power may be used, despite the high cost of installation and need for maintenance. Storage capacity. Space needs vary at different levels of the system, depending on the amount and type of vaccine expected to be stored. In a typi-cal health center, a refrigerator should be expected to hold a one-month supplyof vaccines and diluent, and one to two weeks of reserve stock. Half the totalspace in a refrigerator should be left empty so that air can circulate, and thereshould be room in the bottom for frozen icepacks or sealed bottles of coldwater to keep the interior cool if the power fails. Supply interval. The supply interval also must be considered in calculating the amount of space needed to store vaccines. For example, where roads areimpassable during parts of the year, health facilities may need to have athree-month supply of vaccines and other supplies delivered just before roadsclose and sufficient refrigerator spaceto store all of this vaccine. Cold Boxes and VaccineCarriers Cold boxes and vaccine carriers areinsulated containers that are linedwith icepacks to keep vaccines anddiluent cold. Managers should consider a number of technical questions in selecting acold box or vaccine carrier, including: How much vaccine, ice, and diluent must be carried How much the equipment weighs - especially if it is to be carried on a bicycle or by a person on foot How long the equipment is supposed to last How much \"cold life\" they need Cold life is the interval between the time that the coldest point in the load stored in a piece of equipment passes -3\u00b0C until the temperature reaches Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II At this health facility, a cold box is used to store vaccines on a temporary basis.112Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logistics+10\u00b0C at a given ambient temperature, usually +32\u00b0C and +43\u00b0C. Cold life is measured \"without openings.\" At +43\u00b0C (a temperature easily reached in aclosed vehicle in the tropics), cold life can range from eight hours for NID car-riers to 120 hours for large long-range cold boxes. Cold boxes are normally used to transport vaccine from the central level to the provinces, from provinces to districts, and sometimes from districts to theservice delivery level. (Refrigerated vehicles are rarely used for vaccines indeveloping countries because they are costly and subject to frequent break-downs: a good cold box works as wellor better.) Cold boxes also are usedfor temporary storage when a refriger-ator is out of order or being defrosted. Vaccine carriers , which are more portable, are commonly used to trans-port vaccine from district stores tosmaller health facilities and to outreachsessions. Special \"NID carriers\" arebags or boxes that have the benefit ofbeing lightweight; however, they havea short cold life and are not durable. Icepacks An icepack is a flat rectangular plastic container designed to be filled withwater, frozen, and then used to keepvaccines cold. Icepacks must beplaced in a cold box or vaccinecarrier in a precise way, so their sizeis important. When buying a cold boxor vaccine carrier, purchasers areadvised to order at least one extraset of icepacks so that while one setis being used, the other is beingfrozen, a process that usually takes atleast 24 hours. Management of StorageEquipment Obtaining the best available and most appropriate equipment at the lowestcost is only one aspect of keeping the Credit: WHO Placing icepacks inside a cold box. Credit: WHO Icepacks inside vaccine carrier.113Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logisticscold chain in operation. A second, and perhaps even more important, task is to manage the equipment, which requires: Keeping an equipment inventory Planning and budgeting for maintenance and repair Planning and budgeting for replacements Preparation for emergencies These tasks are described in detail in the documents cited in the reference sec- tion at the end of the chapter. Equipment Inventory Equipment management includes setting up and updating records about theequipment, tools, and spare parts that are being used or in stock. A goodequipment inventory will provide the information that is needed to track thelocation of larger pieces of equipment, schedule maintenance and replace-ment, and evaluate the adequacy of stock. Records for each piece of equip-ment should include: Technical information (brand, model, serial number, year of manufacture, date of entry into service, projected replacement date, and date of finalremoval from service) Specific location Current condition (working, in repair, out of commission) Equipment Maintenance and Repair Maintenance is performed to reduce the likelihood of equipment failure, and repair is performed to fix equipment when it fails. Planning for maintenanceincludes identifying what needs to be done on a regular basis to clean theequipment and keep it running, ensuring that appropriate tools and spareparts are available, and scheduling these activities. Some types of equipment,e.g., vaccine refrigerators, need daily, weekly, and monthly attention; othersneed maintenance after use, e.g., coldboxes and vaccine carriers. Equipment manufacturers usually describe maintenance requirements inthe manuals and other documents thataccompany their products. Healthworkers and others who use or areresponsible for maintaining cold chainequipment need training. Credit: WHO114Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and LogisticsSince any equipment can break down, repair workshops are needed with appropriate tools, spare parts, and skilled technicians. The availability of tools, spare parts, fuel, training, and labor for maintenance and repair can be major problems. Planners and donors tend to fund the pur-chase of new equipmentand vehicles without alsoplanning and budgeting forfuel, spare parts, mainte-nance, and repair. ReplacementPlanning Even with the best of care,equipment will eventuallywear out or become obso-lete. To avoid interruptionsof immunization services,long-term and annual plansare needed for replacingequipment. Most manufacturers provide estimates of the life expectancy oftheir equipment, and the Product Information Sheets, a reference publishedevery few years by WHO and UNICEF, include life-expectancy norms. Some governments have established policies, based on WHO recommenda- tions, that call for the replacement of all refrigerators and freezers after tenyears of use. WHO also recommends that refrigerators for storing vaccines beinstalled in all new health centers. As equipment is inventoried and installed, a replacement date should be determined and recorded in the inventory. Schedules can be set for selectingand ordering equipment, which may take a number of months to be delivered;and plans made for financing the purchase. Technicians at national, provincial, and district levels need training in equip- ment installation, especially when new types, such as CFC-free and solar equipment, are introduced. Regular mai ntenance and repair can extend the life of vehicles.

Planning for theseemergencies can minimizedamage to vaccines and dis-ruptions in immunizationservices. In every place thathas vaccine storage equip-ment, staff should set upwarning systems for identify-ing an equipment failure andmake arrangements inadvance for moving vaccinesto the nearest location that has appropriate substitute equipment. In provincialand district stores, standby equipment and power generators should be avail-able on the premises. In health facilities at the peripheral level, equipment foremergency use may be found in businesses or private homes. Equipment outages caused by shortages of spare parts and fuel should not occur. They should be avoided if there is regular monitoring of stocks andordering of new supplies. Vaccine Handling Proper handling of vaccines requires correct packing and storing of vaccinesand diluents, and correct reconstitution of freeze-dried vaccines. Packing Vaccines in Cold Boxes and Vaccine Carriers Freeze-sensitive vaccines may be damaged if they are placed in closecontact with icepacks. This can bean expensive loss, especially whennew vaccines are involved. Healthworkers are therefore advised toremove icepacks from the freezerand keep them at room temperaturebefore putting them in cold boxes orcarriers. This \"conditioning\" process Credit: Anne B. Keiser Continuous monitoring of vaccine stocks is needed, as shown in this national cold room. Credit: Anne B. Keiser116Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and Logisticstakes several hours at an ambient temperature of +20\u00b0C and less time at high- er temperatures. The ice is conditioned when it begins to move around insidethe icepack and makes a rattling sound when shaken next to the ear. Storing Diluent Diluent is a liquid that is used to reconstitute BCG, yellow fever, measles, andfreeze-dried formulations of monovalent Hib Combination vaccinesthat include freeze-dried Hib are reconstituted with DTP or with a DTP-Hep Bcombination. The manufacturers of freeze-dried vaccines also manufacture thediluents needed for reconstituting their vaccines. The vaccine should alwaysbe reconstituted with the diluent provided by the manufacturer for thatsame vaccine. Diluent can be stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C or at room temperature but should not be frozen, as diluent ampoules are fragile and may crack in freezing tempera-tures. If stored at room temperature, they should be cooled to below +8\u00b0Cbefore use to avoid thermal shock to the vaccine. Reconstitution A sterile needle and sterile syringe are needed to remove diluent from itsampoule and add it to freeze-dried vaccine in its vial. Again, only the diluentsupplied by the vaccine's manufacturer should be used, and care should betaken to use the whole amount of diluent for reconstitution. Once reconstituted,the vaccine vial should be wrapped in the foam pad from a vaccine carrier, inpaper, or in foil to protect it from direct sunlight. The wrapped vial should bekept on ice. After six hours or at the end of a session, whichever comes first, reconstituted vaccines must be discarded. Transportation Management For immunization services to function properly, vaccine, fuel, spare parts, and health workers have to be at the right place at the right time. Transportationmanagement has a critical role to play. It consists of five components, asdescribed by TRANSAID in its Transport Management Manual. Cable from country to headquarters: \"The trucks don't keep vaccine cool.\" Headquarters' trees.\"117Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and LogisticsFleet management This consists of the selection, purchase, record keeping, maintenance, and repairof the vehicles operated under a singleauthority, such as a program or districthealth management team. It includes: Setting up and maintaining a vehicle inventory that records for each vehicle:year, make and model, physical loca-tion, major use, total kilometers, aver-age kilometers per month, averagedays used per month, and condi-tion Identifying vehicle replacement needs for a given period oftime, for example five years Defining technical speci- fications for the pur-chase of vehicles;selecting and procur-ing vehicles Providing preventive maintenance thatincludes driver train-ing, daily vehicle defect reporting,vehicle inspection, vehicle servicing atregular intervals, and correction ofdefects; maintenance may be performedby an organization's own staff or anoutside contractor Arranging for disposal of vehicles at the end of their useful lives Operational management This involves planning, scheduling, andcontrolling the use of vehicles and definingroles and responsibilities of managers,transport officers, drivers, and users. Whendone correctly, it can increase the numberof kilometers traveled per vehicle by 20%per month and increase the total length oftime that vehicles can be used for servicedelivery. Such savings can mean that fewervehicles are needed or that availablevehicles can be used to extend services tounreached populations or meet otherservice objectives. Management Information Transportation management relies on infor-mation. Transportation experts recommend that information on the following perform-ance indicators be compiled and analyzedon every vehicle every month: Kilometers traveled Fuel utilization: Number of kilometers traveled for each liter of fuel used Running cost per kilometer, including fuel, maintenance, and tire costs Availability: Amount of time during the period that the vehicle was ready for use as compared to the time it was broken down or undergoing maintenance Utilization: Amount of time that a vehicle was actu- ally used Needs satisfaction: Percentage of author- ized requests for vehi- cle use that were met Safety record Human Resources All staff members contribute to the effective- ness of the transport system, but specialistsare needed to manage and operate it. Thespecialists for whom training and supervi-sion are required include transport officers,service managers, vehicle operators,mechanics, vehicle inspectors, and vehicleoperator trainers. Policies Policies are needed to guide or give direc-tion to transport systems, which is why theyare shown as handlebars on the motorcy-cle above. Policies should address: Authorized vehicle operators and pas- sengers Roles and responsibilities of managers, transport specialists, operators, andpassengers Selection, procurement, replacement, and disposal of vehicles Vehicle planning at national, sub- national, district, and local levels.The Five Components of Transportation Management Source: TRANSAID, 2001118Immunization Essentials Chapter 6: Cold Chain and LogisticsReferences Family Planning Logistics Management. 2000.

Chapters 5 and 6 address the vaccine quality, storage,and handling aspects of immunization safety. This chapter discusses safe injec-tion practices, selection of injection and other equipment, and waste disposal. A safe injection is defined by the World Health Organization as an injection that: Does not harm the recipient Does not expose the health care worker to any avoidable risks Does not result in waste that is dangerous to the community Over 16 billion injections are given every year in developing countries for immunizations, therapeutic purposes, transfusion of blood and blood products,and as injectable contraceptives. Any of these injections, if unsafe, can trans-mit hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, hemorrhagic fevers, malaria, tetanus, andother diseases. Poor injection techniques can cause abscesses and infectedlymph nodes as well. Source: Hauri, 2003 Only 5% of the 16 billion injections given annually are for immunizations,and studies have shown that immunization injections are among the safest.However, most vaccines currently available are given by injection, and globalconcern about unsafe injections has compelled immunization managers andGlobal Estimates of Infections Attributable to Unsafe Injections from Any Type of Injection Hepatitis B cases 20 million (39% of all new hepatitis B infections per year) Hepatitis C cases 2 million (40% of all hepatitis C casesper year) HIV infections 250,000 (5.4% of all HIV infectionsper year)122Immunization Essentials Chapter 7: Injection Safetyproviders to address safety issues more seriously than ever. Improved equip- ment, such as auto-disable (A-D) syringes and safety boxes, has helped, butchanges are required in human behavior and in the health system, too. The firststep is to identify the primary causes of unsafe injections. Programs can thenplan and implement training, supervision, provision of injection equipment,waste disposal, information campaigns and other activities as appropriate. Assessing Injection Safety Unsafe injection practices may not always be obvious nor the causes andmagnitude of problems clear. To help national immunization programs andothers evaluate injection safety, WHO has made a number of assessment toolsavailable through SIGN and the Expanded Programme on Immunization.These tools enable managers to assess policies, plans, and standards; healthworker practices and reasons for them; and issues related to equipment. Theyinclude the Rapid Assessment and Response Guide, the EPI tool to assess thesafety of injection practices, and a WHO tool to assess health care wastemanagement. As with any generic assessment instrument, these tools should be adapted to reflect local needs and conditions. Most importantly, an effort should be madeto ensure that the information generated by any assessment is actually used toimprove injection safety. This requires engaging stakeholders at the outset inthe decision to conduct an assessment, and later in design, planning, datacollection, analysis, and formulation of recommendations.Safe Injection Global Network (SIGN) SIGN is an association of stakeholders sharing a com-mon interest in the safe and appropriate use of injec-tions. SIGN associates include internationalorganizations such as WHO and UNICEF, NGOs,developing country governments, donor organizations,universities, health care worker organizations, indus-tries, and others. SIGN exchanges information, ideas,and experience from diverse groups and fosters thedevelopment and use of innovative, cost-effectiveapproaches to promote safe and appropriate use ofinjections for all health care applications. 123Immunization Essentials Chapter 7: Injection SafetySafe Injection Policies Governments have the primary responsibility for ensuring that injections are safe. At a minimum, policies are needed to address the following key issues: Reduction of the total number of unnecessary injections Promotion of safe injection practices Provision of sufficient quantities of appropriate injection equipment and infection control supplies Management of sharps waste A policy that addresses only immunization injections is insufficient. Safe injec- tion policies should apply to all public and private health care services, includ-ing maternal and child health, dentistry, familyplanning, curative care (including HIV/AIDS),blood collection, and laboratory services. Thepolicies should be introduced to all stakehold-ers, including donors, clients, and their families.Health care budgets should include adequateresources to cover the costs of: Needles and syringes Safety boxes Training Incinerator equipment and spare parts Fuel for incinerators Sterilizing equipment, spare parts, and fuel in places where sterilizable injection equip-ment continues to be used An Integrated Approach to Policy Making and Planning Integrated policies should take into account the following programs and concerns: HIV/AIDS prevention programs should raise awareness about the risks of unsafe injections. National drug policies should address injection overuse. Essential drugs programs should budget for sterile syringes and needles, safety boxes, and other equipment. Governments and partners should provide matching quantities of sterile syringes and needles and safety boxes. Health systems should include sharps waste management as a required \"duty of care.\" Credit: Daniel Cima, American Red Cross124Immunization Essentials Chapter 7: Injection SafetyTo assist countries with planning for injection safety, SIGN has published an aide-memoire on developing a national strategy for the safe and appropriateuse of injections. This document provides both a checklist and more detailedguidance on steps that countries can take in developing and implementinginjection safety policies. Setting, communicating, and adhering to clear national policies is especially important in mass vaccination campaigns, when a large number of immuniza-tion injections are given in a short time, often by personnel who do not rou-tinely give injections. Such campaigns also involve temporary distributionsystems for vaccine, supplies, and equipment and arrangements for wastemanagement. To help governments conduct safe campaigns, in 2002,WHO/EPI issued another aide-memoire that outlines the actions needed toreduce the risk of unsafe injections. Injection Practices Changing the behavior of health workers and clients may be the most impor- tant step required to make injections safe. SIGN and WHO have identifiedcritical issues and made recommendations for addressing them, as outlined onthe next page. Training and supervision are discussed further in Chapter 9. Credit: WHO125Immunization Essentials Chapter 7: Injection SafetyAnother response to injection safety problems is public information, but this can be a double-edged sword. While information campaigns can increase thedemand for injection safety, they can also discourage people from gettingthose injections that are needed, such as vaccinations. To inform people aboutinjection safety without frightening them, health officials should communicatewhat is being done to solve the problem whenever a situation involving unsafeinjections occurs. People also should be told what they can do themselves toreduce the risks. Injection Practice Problems and Recommendations Problems Recommendations 1. Use of unsterile injection equipment. Auto-disable syringes and needles, which are recommended by WHO for immuniza-tions, may be unavailable. Sterilization equipment or fuel may not be available for sterilizable syringes and needles, which are still commonly used fortherapeutic purposes.To assure that health workers use a sterile syringe and needle for each injection, man-agers should forecast, order, and assurereliable delivery of adequate quantities. Health workers should alert supervisors of shortages. Managers should ensure that equipment, fuel and spare parts are included in thebudget and provided as planned. 2. Unsafe collection of sharps. Health workers are unaware of the danger to themselves and others caused by their notplacing disposable syringes and needles insafety boxes. Health workers are unaware of the dangers of recapping needles. Health workers do not have or do not use safety boxes.The health system should promote safe han- dling of injection equipment through poli-cies, training, supervision, andinformational campaigns. Trainers should require that health workers demonstrate mastery of safe injectiontechniques. Supervisors should monitor handling of injection equipment, use of safety boxes,and management of supplies. 3. Unsafe management of waste. Health workers do not know how to handle waste or lack the appropriate equipment todestroy it. Used equipment is dumped into public areas where children and others scavenge it.Trainers and supervisors should require that health workers demonstrate the ability tohandle and destroy waste. Supervisors should monitor waste management. The health system should provide informa- tion to the public about the risks of handlingmedical waste. 4. Overuse of therapeutic injections. Because it is the norm to use injections, injections are over-prescribed. Some health workers believe that injections work faster and better than oralmedications. Patients may prefer injections to oral medication.Health workers should prescribe oral med- ication whenever possible. The health system should educate the public on the effectiveness of oral medication. 126Immunization Essentials Chapter 7: Injection SafetyLocal circumstances and awareness of the problem should be used togauge how best to share informa-tion with the public. For example,in a country with high rates ofHIV/AIDS and awareness that dirtyneedles and syringes can transmitHIV, publicizing the introduction ofA-D syringes for immunizationcould reassure people that some-thing is being done to address aproblem they recognize. In othersettings, publicity about A-Dsyringes may create needless anxi-ety and do more harm than good. Of course, the most important fac- tor in maintaining public confi-dence in immunization services isto ensure the safety of injections. Injection Equipment Injection equipment that can be used to administer injectablevaccines includes: Auto-disable syringes Standard devices that are speciallymade to prevent reuse and aretherefore less likely than or sterilizablesto of blood-borne workers prefer A-Dsyringes because they save the timethat they would otherwise spend on sterilization. Although these syringes aremore costly than other types, the cost is decreasing as demand increases. Auto-disable (A-D) syringe.

Credit: SIGN127Immunization Essentials Chapter 7: Injection SafetyThe use of A-D syringes, however, generates a large volume of potentially dangerous waste. As with any equipment, there is no guarantee againstimproper use; therefore policies, training, supervision, and other measures areneeded to support correct use and disposal of A-D syringes. The use of A-Dsyringes greatly increased in 2001, when GAVI advised the Vaccine Fund toprovide them in sufficient quantity to cover both newly-introduced and \"tradi-tional\" vaccines for at least three years, based on acceptable country propos-als for immunization injection safety. Conventional Disposable Syringes Conventional disposable syringes are plastic syringes with steel needles that areprovided by the manufacturer in a sterile package. The needle may either befixed to the syringe when it is produced or attached by the health worker justbefore use. These syringes are intended to be used only once, but they are, infact, quite easy to use multiple times. Since they cannot be properly sterilized,their re-use places the public at high risk of disease and death, and WHO andUNICEF recommend that they not be used for immunization purposes. WHO-UNICEF-UNFPA Statement on the Use of Auto -Disable Syringes in Immunization Services In a joint statement issued in December 1999, WHO, UNICEF, and the UnitedNations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) said: The auto-disable syringe, which is now widely available at low cost, presents the low- est risk of person-to-person transmission of blood-borne pathogens (such as hepatitis Bor HIV) because it cannot be reused. The auto-disable syringe is the equipment ofchoice for administering vaccines, both in routine immunization and mass campaigns. WHO, UNICEF and United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) urge that, by the end of 2001, all countries should use auto-disable or sterilizablesyringes only. Standard disposable syringes should no longer be used for immu-nization. WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA urge that, by the end of 2003, all countries should use only auto-disable syringes for immunization.

Theyare designed to ensure that clients getthe correct amount of vaccine and thatthe injection is safe. In some settings,they have been used to take moreheat-stable vaccines like tetanus toxoidand hepatitis B vaccine to hard-to-reach areas beyond the cold chain.Their relatively higher cost, greater stor-age requirements, and more limitedavailability suggest that they are appropriate for use in selected circumstances. Sterilizables Sterilizable injection equipment consists of plastic syringes and steel needles that are designed for re-use after cleaning and sterilization in a steam sterilizeror autoclave. Sterilizables are the least expensive per injection and have the lowest volume for re-supply and waste disposal. However, they require more handling byhealth workers for cleaning and sterilizing the equipment, which may increasethe risk of needle-stick injury. Health personnel must also order supplies suchas fuel and spare parts for the sterilizers. Supervisors need to monitor the useof this equipment constantly. Sterilizable syringes and needles are being phased out for immunization injec- tions but continue to be used for reconstituting freeze-dried vaccines. They arestill used extensively for injections other than immunization. Reconstituting Freeze-Dried Vaccines with Syringes and Needles Even if A-D syringes are adopted for use with all vaccines, there will still be a need to order and distribute mixing syringes to reconstitute lyophilized vaccines such asmeasles, BCG, and some Hib vaccines. To ensure safety, one sterile mixing syringeand needle should be used for each new vial of vaccine that is reconstituted. If small vial sizes are introduced, for example, two-dose vials of pentavalent vaccine, thequantity of mixing syringes required will increase substantially compared to needs for10-dose or 20-dose vials. Where A-D syringes are used for all vaccine administration and steam sterilizers are no longer required for immunization equipment, managers will have to decide whetherto dispose of mixing syringes after each vial is reconstituted or to sterilize them alongwith other non-immunization equipment.

They should useappropriate sterilization equip-ment and carefully adhere tomanufacturers' directions. Sterilizers made for vaccination equipment have one, two, orthree racks, each of which holds approximately 40 syringes and 50 needles.In addition to the sterilizer itself, thefollowing items are needed for thecleaning and sterilizing procedure: abasin for washing used syringes andneedles, a timer, stove, andfuel. Time, steam, and temperatureindicators (TST) are required for everysterilization cycle. These strips orspots change color irreversibly whenthe contents of a sterilizer have beensterilized. Health workers must keeprecords of their use to document thatsterilization has been done. In compliance with a joint statement issued by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, steamsterilizers made for vaccination equipment will not be available from UNICEFSupply Division after 2003. Spare parts and sterilizable syringes will continueto be available for a limited time until national immunization programs makethe full transition to A-D syringes. Management of Sharps Waste As the use of A-D syringes has increased, so has the urgency ofensuring that all injection supplies aredisposed of properly. Careless dispos-al places health workers and the pub-lic at high risk of needle-stick injuries. Used syringes and needles should never be dumped in open areas These Practices Are Unsafe! Recapping needles (can result in needle sticks for health workers) Changing the needle after an injec- tion but using the same syringe Reusing the needle and syringe for multiple patients Boiling needles and syringes Flaming the needle Reusing mixing syringes Credit: San Credit: Veronique Leger130Immunization Essentials Chapter 7: Injection Safetywhere people might pick them up, step on them, or come in contact with them in any other way. The need to better manage contaminated sharps has prompted the develop- ment of tools to assist countries with planning and policy development.Available from WHO and SIGN, these tools include an assessment tool forhealth care waste management that examines current practices, level ofawareness of risks, and the country's regulatory framework in order to pro-vide essential information for designing an action plan. Also available is anaide-memoire for developing a national strategy for safe health care wastemanagement. Safety Boxes Safety boxes, or sharps containers,are puncture-resistant containers intowhich A-D syringes and needles areplaced immediately after use and tem-porarily stored until they can bedestroyed. They should be supplied insufficient quantity such that a safetybox is always within reach of a vacci-nator, even during outreach sessions. The volume of used syringes and nee- dles that safety boxes must accommo-date can be significant, as describedin the box. Wastage Volume of Used Needles and Syringes Approximately 100 2ml syringes and nee-dles (used for most childhood vaccinations)fill a five-liter safety box. Five and 10mlsyringes take up more space. For a health facility with a catchment popu- lation of 30,000, a birth rate of 30 per1000, and 100% childhood immunizationcoverage, eight five-liter safety boxes willbe filled every month with used syringesand needles. In addition to the eight boxes per month for children's immunizations, the health facility will need additional boxes for TT and cura-tive care injection equipment. The volume of waste produced in immunization cam-paigns, which may cover children up to five or more years of age, is also significant.

Credit: WHO131Immunization Essentials Chapter 7: Injection SafetyWaste Disposal and Destruction Once nearly full, safety boxes should be incin- erated. If an incinerator is not available, amuch less desirable and effective alternative isto douse them with kerosene and burn them.In planning waste disposal, managers shouldconsult medical waste disposal policies andenvironmental regulations for the national andlocal levels. They should make plans for the: Location of disposal facilities: Ideally, every health facility would havean incinerator. Because cost and demandlimit the practicality of this solution, dis-tricts may install incinerators at strategiclocations, such as hospitals. Disposal of filled safety boxes: Properly functioning incinerators, operatedby trained personnel, ensure the most complete destruction of syringesand needles. They also produce less air pollution than burning by othermeans at lower temperatures. Burning in a metal drum is considered thenext best option after incineration but may not destroy the waste complete-ly and may result in heavy smoke. Open burning and burying are muchless effective and not recommended. Schedule and budget for destruction of safety boxes: A regular schedule should be developed and maintained, and funds should be pro-vided for sufficient quantities of fuel. Logistics: What arrangements are needed to ensure transport of waste from health facilities to incineration sites, a reliable supply of fuel for incin-erators, provision of spare parts, and tools for maintenance and repair? Training: Training is needed for health workers, incinerator operators, and others, for example, those who transport waste. Such considerationsshould be included in training curricula. Incineration Equipment Auto-combustion incinerators that reach temperatures of over 800\u00b0C destroy contaminated sharps and syringes most effectively. Work is now under way inmany countries to equip district hospitals and large health centers with thiskind of incinerator. However, means of disposing of waste from small facili-ties, like dispensaries and health posts, and at the end of outreach visits arestill under study. While improvements in waste management continue, work is under way to develop new disposal technologies. Some of the technologies that soon maybe available are described in Chapter 11. Credit: D.

In the 1990s, national pro-gram managers and donors started tolook more closely at the effect of immu-nization services on the incidence ofdisease, and disease surveillancebecame a more prominent activity. Disease surveillance is the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data todetermine disease trends and patterns.Disease surveillance provides informa-tion such as: Disease incidence, morbidity, and mortality, and progress in achiev-ing disease control goals Changes in patterns of morbidity and mortality among different age groups in different geographical areasand among different economic, social, or cultural groups Impact of immunization strategies on disease incidence Disease trends The overriding value of disease surveillance, however, is its use as a tool to identify the presence of infectious diseases and guide actions to prevent themfrom becoming threats to public health. This chapter describes the activitiesrequired to carry out that function. Health worker at a rural clinic displays the surveillance and coverage charts he created. Credit: Ann Jimerson136Immunization Essentials Chapter 8: Disease SurveillanceTypes of methodsare to obtaindifferent types of sur-veillance information,as described below. Facility-BasedRoutineSurveillance In many countries, health workers are required to report on the number ofindividuals that come to their facility and are diagnosed with reportablediseases. These reportable diseases are usually diseases that have outbreakpotential, such as cholera, polio, and measles, or diseases that are targets ofnational control programs, such as malaria and tetanus. Data on individualpatients, which are recorded in patient registers (Chapter 4), are used to cal-culate the number of cases of reportable diseases diagnosed by health facilitystaff over a certain period of time. These data are periodically reported todistrict authorities who compile and send them to higher administrative levels.This process of detecting and reporting information on diseases that bringpatients to the health facility is known as passive surveillance. Passive surveillance yields only limited data because many sick people do not visit a health facility and because those cases that do show up may notbe correctly classified,recorded, or reported.If managers fail to fullyunderstand these limi-tations, they mayincorrectly interprettrends and patterns ofinfectious diseases. One way to overcome the limitations of pas-sive surveillance andget a better picture ofdisease burden Engstrom137Immunization Essentials Chapter 8: Disease Surveillancecommunity is for health workers to visit health facilities and communities to seek out cases. This is known as active surveillance. Since passive surveillance has limitations due to its lack of access to some groups within the population, active surveillance is often used to enhance thecompleteness of a passive surveillance system. Active surveillance is also moreexpensive than a passive system and requires considerable additional effort toorganize. This means that active surveillance is usually conducted on a limit-ed segment of the population and for only a brief period. Active surveillanceis, therefore, used to gain targeted insight into a situation and not collect rou-tine data over a long period of time. Routine surveillance by health facilities, whether passive or active, is often hampered by the difficulty of making accurate diagnoses. Health workers maylack the proper equipment or training for diagnosis in the health facility, andlaboratory services are often not available to confirm clinical diagnoses. In certain instances, health workers conduct case-based investigations to learn more about a specific illness pattern, for example, when there is a suspectedcase of a disease targeted foreradication, such as polio, or dur-ing suspected outbreaks of epi-demic-prone diseases such asyellow fever. In case-based inves-tigations, health workers recordinformation such as the patient'sname, age, vaccination status,location, date of disease onset,suspected diagnosis, and labora-tory results (when available). Community-Based Surveillance With training, members of the community can expand facility-based surveil- lance by detecting and reporting cases that may go undetected by the healthfacility. A good example of this is the use of community members to detectcases of guinea worm ( dracunculiasis ). In villages where the disease is endem- ic, volunteers are trained to detect and report cases using a standard diagnos-tic criterion, e.g., painful legs that have skin ulcers with worms protruding.They then may undertake treatment, referral, and containment measures suchas bandaging the ulcer, instructing infected persons not to bathe in water fromponds and streams, and promoting the use of filtered drinking water. Community-based surveillance needs the support of trained health care work- Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II138Immunization Essentials Chapter 8: Disease Surveillanceers who in turn provide training to the community on how to recognize the disease and how to respond when people are ill. While the focus of communi-ty surveillance may be on a specific disease, community members may alsobe trained to detect an array of health problems. Community members andhealth workers can work together to organize transport, childcare, and otherassistance and, sometimes, provide medical supplies, treatment, and vaccina-tions. Reports by community members should be incorporated into the overallsurveillance data managed by health personnel. Health systems should alsoprovide feedback to the community about disease patterns in their own andsurrounding areas. Community-based surveillance can be very useful in detecting and treating some illnesses. However, it generally has a high error rate and should beused carefully. Case definitions need to be very simple and specific for com-munity identification and this means that diagnoses need to be confirmed bysomeone with more advanced training. While it is always wise to involve thecommunity as much as possible in health initiatives, community-based surveil-lance is not appropriate for all conditions and situations. Health workersshould carefully test the community-based approach before initiating it andshould be prepared to regularly monitor activities to ensure that definitions arebeing applied correctly and that the health of the community members isbeing served well by this approach to surveillance. Sentinel Surveillance Sentinel surveillance is the collection and analysis of data by designated institutions selected for their geographic location, medical specialty, andability to accurately diagnose and report high quality data. For example,district hospitals may be required to report specific conditions such as bacteri-al meningitis in order to quantify the burden of disease due to Haemophilus influenzae type b. Generally, sentinel surveillance is useful for answering specific epidemiologic questions, but, because sentinel sites may not representthe general population or the general incidence of disease, they may havelimited usefulness in analyzing national disease patterns and trends. Surveillance Activities Surveillance for communicable diseases involves: Detection Reporting Analysis and interpretation Presentation Response139Immunization Essentials Chapter 8: Disease SurveillanceDetection Surveillance begins with case detection. To accurately detect disease, health workers need case definitions that are appropriate for the local context, andthey need practice in applying them, especially when they do not see a spe-cific illness very often. For example, health workers in one country had diffi-culty identifying yellow fever cases according to the clinical symptoms ofyellow eyes or dark urine, but case detection became easier after theylearned the local term for the disease: \"horse-urine eye disease.\" Even with appropriate case definitions, clinical diagnoses can be a problem. Many illnesses have similar symptoms, such as fever and rash, and can bedifferentiated only by laboratory tests that may not be accessible. Reporting Most ministries of health require that facilities routinely report the total count ofcases of each reportable disease that has occurred within a specified timeperiod (weekly or monthly). When no cases have occurred during the period,the report should indicate this fact. WHO has developed forms for reportingeach disease that can be adapted to meet national needs. In most countries, policies require that routine reports include the aggregate number of cases of each disease over a specified time period, for example onemonth. But for some diseases or conditions, such as acute flaccid paralysis(AFP), cases must be notified immediately upon detection. Individual caseZero Reporting: Does No News Necessarily Mean Good News? A hypothetical health post's disease report showed the following: In this example, it is clear that there were no cases of diphtheria during the reportingperiod, but it is not clear whether there were any cases of cholera. The practice of put-ting a \"0\" when there are no cases is called \"zero reporting.\" Knowing that therewere no cases of a specific disease may be just as important as knowing the numberof cases that were detected.Disease Number of cases Measles 25 Cholera Diphtheria 0140Immunization Essentials Chapter 8: Disease Surveillancereports usually include case information, exposures prior to illness, contacts after illness, and laboratory results, but the details differ depending on the disease. Reporting procedures should be designed to operate effectively under the wide variety of local conditions in a given country. Health officials at the nationallevel should not assume that the electric power, telephone lines, and computersavailable to health facilities in the capital city are available to health workersthroughout the country. They should recognize that some facilities might dependon truck drivers or other travelers to carry news of an outbreak to the appropri-ate authorities. For example, only half the health facilities in the study reported below would be able to report an outbreak by telephone. The ability to report and act immediately becomes critical when dealing with diseases that have outbreak potential, such as measles and cholera. Whencommunication capabilities do not allow for immediate notification of out-breaks, local health workers should have the authority and resources to takequick action to stem the spread of the disease while help is being summoned from district or national authorities. Analysis and Interpretation Surveillance data are of little use for local decision-making and planning unless health workers know how to analyze the data and understand theirimplications. Health workers need to be able to interpret trends and patternsof disease in order to inact prompt control measures and avoid actions thatare not appropriate. In order to analyze and interpret surveillance data, health workers need to be aware of the limitations and peculiarities of the data set. They need to con-duct basic analyses first and then proceed to more complex forms of analysis.They need to recognize when the data will no longer support the type ofTelecommunications Capacity to Report Disease in One African Country Means of communication Percent of Facilities with Access Regional Health Bureaus(n = 11 )Zonal HealthDepartments(n = 12 ) Health Facilities(n Essentials Chapter 8: Disease Surveillanceanalysis they are proposing, and finally, their analyses should be directed at answering critical questions that are needed for planning, implementation andevaluation of public health actions. Health workers also need to be aware of phenomena such as \"the surveil- lance effect\" that occurs when improvements are made in disease surveillance\u2014 that is, the number of reported cases almost invariably increases becauseof better reporting rather than because of an increase in disease incidence, asshown in the example. In this example, even though an increase like the one that occurred in 1999 may simply reflect the surveillance effect rather than a genuine rise in diseaseincidence, because such data can also indicate real problems, they should notbe ignored. Trend data only indicate possible problems, so health workersneed to investigate further to be able to correctly interpret their meaning anddetermine what actions to take. Other cautions should be taken in interpreting surveillance data. For example, some diseases are still underreported, notably neonatal tetanus and measles.Planners must realize that these diseases are major contributors to child mor-tality even if the data are incomplete. Similarly, immunization services alsocan be the victims of their own success when planners use disease surveil-lance data as the basis for budget allocations. Because there are fewer deathsand disabilities caused by vaccine-preventable diseases when people are vac-cinated, fewer resources may be allocated for the prevention, identification,and treatment of vaccine-preventable diseases. In some cases, a decrease inthe number of reported cases causes districts to shift priorities from immuniza-tion services to other interventions, thus weakening immunization programsand risking a return of vaccine-preventable diseases. Measles Outbreak or Improved Surveillance? Source: WHO, 2000142Immunization Essentials Chapter 8: Disease SurveillancePresentation When data are analyzed and the results interpreted,the information must bepresented in a way thatmeets the needs of the tar-get audience. For exam-ple, highly technicalpresentations of data maybe appropriate for seniorministry officials but notfor local government staff.A presentation to theMinister of Health aboutthe impact of a healthevent should be designeddifferently than one madeto the Minister of Finance. A variety of presenta- tion methods are avail-able. For example,maps that show thelocation areuseful for informa-tion, well casesand geographical anddemographic featuresas well as show howcases are clustered. Maps of district and facility catchment areas can be sketched by hand, orgovernment maps may be available in hard copy or electronically. Besides maps, information can be made more understandable by use of rates, tables, graphs, trend lines, data transformations, and projections. All of thesemethods help make raw data more easily understood and should be tailoredto the appropriate audience. 143Immunization Essentials Chapter 8: Disease SurveillanceResponse Disease surveillance enables managers to respond to existing problems and take steps to prevent anticipated problems. Responses may include verificationof reported cases, treatment, search for new cases, or supplemental vaccina-tion activities, but all must be tailored to the disease and the situation. Forexample, it may be difficult to quickly contain an outbreak of a highly conta-gious disease, such as measles, with only a mass vaccination response. Forother less contagious diseases, such as yellow fever, mass vaccination canhave a more dramatic short-term impact. The ability to report and act immediately becomes critical when dealing with diseases that have outbreak potential, such as measles and cholera.When communication capabilities do not allow for immediate notification of outbreaks, local health workers should have the authority and resources to take quick action to stem the spread of the disease while help is being summonedfrom district or national authorities. Responding to routine reports is as important as responding to emergencies. Routine surveillance data, together with coverage and other information, canlead to improvements in immunization services such as the implementation ofstrategies to provide unreached children with services. Managers who receivesurveillance reports should also provide feedback on their timeliness andOutbreak Preparedness Committees Outbreak preparedness committees are used at subnational, national, regional, andglobal levels to prepare for and coordinate responses to outbreaks. Committee mem-bership varies but usually includes epidemiologists, logistics experts, government plan-ners, NGOs, donors, and multilateral agencies. Before outbreaks occur, committees may: Establish guidelines for when and how to respond to outbreaks of different diseases Assess the capacity of the health system to respond Advocate for training in field epidemiology Ensure that vaccine stocks and other supplies will be available in case of an out- break Establish communication channels among partners Set up response coordination mechanisms During an outbreak, the committee coordinates the response, making sure that technical advice is available where needed, that supplies and manpower are distributed andused appropriately, and that communication links are maintained with the public, themedia, neighboring countries, and regional and global networks.144Immunization Essentials Chapter 8: Disease Surveillanceaccuracy, send summaries of the analysis back to health facilities, and describe how they used the data. Laboratories Not all diseases can be diagnosed accurately using clinical definitionsalone. Laboratories are needed toidentify the exact cause of the illness,but well-functioning public health lab-oratories are still unavailable in manydeveloping countries. Even whenavailable, they often lack the equip-ment, reagents, and trained staff toproperly carry out their functions. The process of collecting and transporting specimens from the patient to the laboratory can also be problematic. There are also problems getting laborato-ry results back to health workers. Results often come too late to inform treat-ment or control activities, or they never come, leaving health workers torespond as best as they can with inadequate information. To overcome some of these problems, research is being done on the develop- ment of rapid diagnostics that can be used to supplement the public healthlaboratory. These diagnostics are simple tests that can be performed by atrained health worker in the field to confirm a suspected diagnosis.Decentralized laboratory facilities are also being considered as a way tomove diagnostic confirmation closer to the health facility. As with other aspects of surveillance, communication is important. Health workers need to advise laboratories about the samples they are sending, labo-ratories need to inform health workers and managers of their test findings,and health workers need to notify patients about laboratory results. Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) Adverse events following immunization occur even in the safest programs.Only rarely is there a causal relationship between a vaccination and anadverse event, but health officials need to be vigilant to the possibility of aconnection and take appropriate action. Causes of adverse events are classified under four categories: 1. Program error. An error in vaccine preparation, handling, or adminis- tration, such as: Credit: WHO145Immunization Essentials Chapter 8: Disease Surveillance Giving too much vaccine in one dose Injecting vaccine in the wrong place, such as the buttocks Not using sterilized syringes and needles for each injection Using the wrong diluent or the wrong amount of diluent Giving the wrong vaccine or other biological substance 2. Vaccine reaction. The reaction of a particular individual to the inherent properties of a particular vaccine even when the vaccine has been prepared,handled, and administered correctly. A reaction is usually one of three types: Local: The most common type of reaction usually shows as pain, swelling, or redness at the site of injection. These reactions occur within afew hours of injection, go away in a short period of time, and pose littledanger. Parents should still report any local reaction that persists to ahealth worker. This type of reaction is most commonly caused by inactivat-ed vaccines. Systemic: Generalized reactions may include fever, malaise, muscle pain, headache, or loss of appetite. They are similar to a very mild formof the disease but pose no serious health risk. These reactions occur morecommonly after injections with live attenuated vaccines than with inactivat-ed vaccines. Allergic: These are the most serious and most rare reactions. They are caused by the body's reaction to a particular component in a vaccine.Severe allergic reactions can be life threatening, which is why goodscreening prior to vaccination is important. Health workers who give vac-cinations should know the signs of allergic reactions and be prepared totake immediate action. Local and systemic reactions, or side effects, are described for each vaccine in Chapter 12. 3. Coincidental. The adverse event occurs after a vaccination has been given but is not caused by the vaccine or its administration. A coincidentalevent is one that would have occurred even if the person had not beenvaccinated. 4. Unknown. The adverse event cannot be directly related to the vaccine, its administration, or any other identifiable cause. While every effort needs to be taken to eliminate avoidable adverse events, concern over the possibility of an adverse reaction needs to be balancedagainst the threat that the disease poses. With respect to vaccine-preventablediseases in developing countries, the danger from the disease is much greater146Immunization Essentials Chapter 8: Disease Surveillancethan from the vaccine. For example, measles poses a far more serious threat than the possibility of an adverse reaction to a measles-containing vaccine, asshown below. One of the responsibilities of National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) described in Chapter 5 is to monitor and investigate adverse events. Mostadverse events are caused by errors in the handling and administration ofvaccines long after they have left the manufacturer. However, NRAs must alsoinvestigate the possibility that a particular vaccine was mislabeled or not man-ufactured correctly even though such problems are extremely rare. Dealing with Rumors Health officials often have to deal with rumors,especially when adverse events occur. Out ofgenuine fear, concern, or less respectablemotives, people start and spread rumors aboutvaccination. These exaggerations of risk canseriously disrupt immunization programs. There are four things that health officials should do to combat rumors: Predict: The same rumors circulate regular- ly, for example, the unfounded accusationthat tetanus toxoid causes sterilization or thefalse association of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) with autism. Prepare: Knowing what rumors are likely to arise, health officials can prepare materials to counteract them in advance. Information shouldalways be available for parents and the media on common side effects ofvaccines. Fast, positive response: When an adverse event occurs, action should be taken immediately to discover the cause and then to correct theproblem and minimize its impact by giving out information.

Professional and political support: Endorsement of immunizations and assurance of their safety should be sought from academic institutions,professional associations, politicians, and respected community leaders. The Expanded Programme on Immunization unit in WHO has created informa- tional and training materials on how to deal with the public and the presswhen an adverse event occurs. Integrated Disease Surveillance Many national health care systems have separate disease surveillance systemsthat serve different purposes or users. For example, vertical disease programs,such as polio eradication and tuberculosis and malaria control, often havetheir own surveillance systems in order to facilitate rapid response. A fragmented approach to disease surveillance results in costly and inefficient duplications of effort, and many countries are trying to respond by developingIntegrated Disease Surveillance (IDS) systems. The collection of disease surveil-lance data has always been integrated at the service delivery level, but asthat information flows upward, it branches out to numerous users in otherdepartments and ministries. If integration can make this process more efficientand still meet the information needs of various users, it will make a valuablecontribution to the increase of knowledge about diseases and to the improve-ment of public health services. Rumors Have Legs! A two-year old boy in an Asian country died five days after he was given vitamin A during a national immunization day for polio. The child's doctor said that the boy haddied of childhood pneumonia, a common cause of death for malnourished children inthe area. In spite of the fact that there was no indication that vitamin A was associated with the child's death, other doctors began to say that vitamin A had caused the death. Therumor spread throughout the country, and health officials were forced to cancel therest of the campaign. As a result, millions of children received neither polio vaccina-tion nor vitamin A supplementation. Rumors have legs and travel quickly. In essence, it is the rumor itself that puts chil- dren's lives at risk. WHO Surveillance Software EpiInfo.

This chapter describes how to take a comprehensiveapproach to behavior change in order to improve the delivery of immuniza-tion services and encourage their appropriate use. In country after country, studies have shown that most people will use immunization services as long as they to know when and where to bringtheir children, and those services are available, accessible, reliable, andfriendly. Thus, the role of communication activities in achieving these condi-tions is important but not sufficient. Dissemination of information, training,supervision, and other ways of improving services need to be employed ina mutually supportive way to promote complete and timely immunization ofwomen and children. Achievement of immunization goals is affected by the behavior of many groups, including: politicians, community leaders, health care providers,managers and supervisors, women of reproductive age, parents, children,and their families. The focus of this chapter is on health care providers andcaretakers. Some of the desired behaviors for different groups that affect immunization services are listed on the following page. These behaviors are generally appli-cable but should be modified as needed to fit specific situations. 152Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior Change Desired Immunization-Related Behaviors Mothers and Other Primary Caretakers Bring children to immunization service delivery points at the ages recommended in the national schedule. Bring each child's health or vaccination card to each health visit. Treat side effects as recommended. Seek tetanus toxoid immunizations for yourself. (This is applicable to mothers and other women of childbearing age.) For campaigns, bring children of the recommended ages to immunization sites on the day(s) recommended. For a house-to-house strategy, keep those children aroundthe home and have them immunized when the team arrives. Fathers Bring children to immunization service delivery points yourself, or encourage their mother to do so. Provide mothers with money for transport or other expenses related to immunizing children. Health Workers Perform immunization tasks correctly, including those that ensure safe injections. Give mothers and other caretakers essential information. Schedule and organize services to make them convenient for parents. Praise families whose children are fully immunized by one year of age. Political and Public Health Leaders Allocate sufficient financial and human resources for immunization services. Show personal support for immunization services. Community Leaders Describe the benefits and safety of vaccinations to others in the community. Remind families when children need to receive the next dose(s) of vaccine. Encourage families to complete each child's basic immunizations in his or her first year of life. Inform families about outreach services, supplemental immunization activities, and new vaccines and improvements in the immunization program. Assist health facility staff in planning and monitoring services. Provide logistical support, e.g., by transporting vaccines, supplies, and staff. Source: WHO, UNICEF, and USAID, 2002153Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior ChangeIdentifying Barriers to Desired Behaviors Indications that various groups are not carrying out the desired behaviors can be found in low immunization coverage data, high drop-out rates, andincreased disease incidence. In light of such indications, program staff shouldundertake additional information gathering to understand the causes of theseproblems and, in behavioral terms, the gaps between desired and actualperformance. Qualitative methods , such as focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, can be used to discover reasons why people act as they do. Themethods selected depend on the nature of the questions to be answered andthe type of respondents. For example, parents and community leaders mayreveal information and beliefs in focus group discussions that they would notshare in one-on-one interviews. In-depth individual interviews, on the otherhand, work better with health workers, whose worry about giving \"wronganswers\" regarding knowledge and practices may keep them silent in frontof their peers. Focus group discussions are in-depth discussions, usuallylasting one to two hours, inwhich six to ten representativesof a target audience talk abouttheir experiences, attitudes,perceptions and feelingsregarding a focused topicunder the guidance of afacilitator. Participants are pur-posefully selected, for exam-ple, because they are mothersof fully immunized children orfathers of drop-outs. In-depth interviews are one-on-one conversations between an interviewer and a respondent, held in a private, confidential setting. In effective inter-views, respondents will offer insights into their practices, thoughts, feelings,and beliefs. Quantitative methods , such as knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) surveys, are helpful in prioritizing causes and calculating the scope of prob-lems identified through qualitative methods. Quantitative data may be usefulfor convincing decision-makers of the need to take action. They also provide abaseline for evaluating results. Focus group participants exchange views on health- related topics. Credit: Ann Jimerson154Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior Change What Mothers Say about Vaccination In focus group discussions, mothers in an African country expressed their percep- tions and experiences: 1. Mothers' knowledge of immunization is poor. More than half could not name one vaccine-preventable disease. However, regardless of their level of knowl-edge or the vaccination status of their children, mothers universally embracethe importance of vaccination for children's health. 2. Side effects concern some mothers, but many accept the fevers and swelling as normal results of vaccinating. Some even suggest that these side effects aredesired as proof that the vaccination is working. 3. The major reason children are not vaccinated is the distance to the place of vaccination. Another barrier is competing demands on mothers' time from otherchildren and fieldwork. 4. Mothers are frustrated by inconsistencies in service provision. \"We lose our motivation to go to the hospital because when we arrive there are often nomedicines.\" 5. In some districts, scheduled vaccination by outreach is unreliable and of poor quality. 6. Mothers value and protect their child's health card like an identity card, and report that a health worker won't treat a child without it. 7. Mothers have varying views on how they are treated by health workers, rang- ing from \"They're marvelous\" to \"There are some that vaccinate as though theyare vaccinating a dog.\" 8. Health education talks are the only form of education on immunization. 9. Focus group mothers considered mothers who don't have their children vacci- nated as \"stupid,\" \"criminals,\" or \"witches.\" 10. Mothers generally have confidence in the technical ability of health workers- although the mothers do not feel informed enough to judge. 11. Illicit charging for services is not reported to be a big problem. Such findings, once combined with results from other interviews and observations, will provide the basis for program actions. While some of these findings are typical for many countries, others are not. For example, distance to health facilities is a major barrier to coverage in this particu-lar country because the government is still rebuilding health infrastructure afteryears of war. Because of the variety of program circumstances in different coun-tries, in-depth, but not necessarily large-scale, research is recommended in coun-tries or districts that are trying to improve their coverage or reduce drop-outs. 155Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior ChangeUsing a combination of methods and exploring the same topic withdifferent groups may provide themost complete insights. For example,in one setting, health workers con-ducted exit interviews to measureclient satisfaction after an immuniza-tion session, and the mothers inter-viewed reported no problems. Later,focus group discussions conductedby independent consultants showedthat these same mothers had seri-ous problems with the way theywere treated by health workers. In separate interviews, the health workersthemselves explained that they treated parents firmly and sometimes evenharshly because they wanted parents to understand how important immuniza-tions were. It took the presentation of findings from focus group discussionswith mothers to make health workers realize that such harsh behavior, thoughwell-intentioned, was driving the mothers away. To avoid compromising the candor of responses, it is recommended that health workers not serve as interviewers or group facilitators. If a programdoes decide to use health workers in these roles, they should not do researchin the geographical area where they normally work. Behavioral Analysis To identify the barriers that seem to discourage a desired behavior and thefactors that support and motivate it, a strength-weakness-opportunity-threat(SWOT) type of analysis can be carried out. In the hypothetical example inthe three boxes on the next page, planners are investigating the reasons for ahigh immunization drop-out rate in a particular district. To help in the analysis,they record current and desired behaviors and the barriers and motivating fac-tors they have found in their research. They look at three different groups ofpeople who may be involved in the problem and who definitely should beinvolved in the solution: health workers, parents, and community leaders.Other groups might be included in another situation. Exit interviews help health workers to understand parents' concerns. Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II156Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior Change Examples of Behavioral Analyses Current BehaviorDesiredBehavior Barriers MotivatingFactors Few health workers (HWs) give infor-mation to parentsabout the need toreturn with theirchildren for the nextdose(s) and when. Few listen to par- impor-tance of informing parents when toreturn for the next immunization. HWs believe that someone else in the health facility is giving theinformation or that the informationon vaccination cards is adequate. They feel they don't have time.HWs get positive feedback from clientswhen they communi-cate well. When communication improves, HWs seean impact in reduceddrop-out rates. One-third of parents do not bring theirchildren understand theimportance of their children com-pleting the primary series of vacci-nations on time. They do not know when to return for the next immunization. They feel intimidated by HWs. They don't expect to receive infor- mation, to understand it, or to geta response to their questions, andso they don't ask. Many families have other priorities, so delay returning. Many families live far away from the health facility, or outreach serv-ices have been discontinued. Facility operations are poorly man- aged, e.g., sometimes childrenwho come to a scheduled sessioncannot get vaccinated becausethere is no vaccine.Parents realize thatvaccines preventsome dangerous dis-eases. They want to protect their young childrenfrom disease. They want to do the right thing, i.e., maketheir children safefrom vaccine-prevent-able diseases. Community leadersare not engaged inensuring vacci-nations on time andthat they beforethe age of with HWs toschedule ses-sions at con-venienttimes.Leaders believe that the health sys-tem alone is responsible for makingsure that children are immunized. They do not realize that they can actually do something to help. They are contending with other social, economic, and health prob-lems.Child health is a pri-ority for communities. Community leaders like to solve problemsthat affect membersof their community. Community leaders have some controlover local fund allo-cations. Once they are active- ly involved, communi-ty leaders may wellsee an impact onreduced drop-outrates.Health Workers Parents Community Leaders157Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior ChangeBehavior Change Strategies The research and analysis described above should give planners a goodpicture of feasible behaviors, barriersthat must be overcome, and positiveknowlege, perceptions, and circum-stances. They can then devise appro-priate program actions to promote andfacilitate those behaviors. Suchactions often include communication,training, service improvement, policy,and other activities. Communication Strategies Communication specialists differentiate among various types of communication depending on the purpose of the communication and the target audience theyare trying to reach. Although different researchers and organizations do notalways share the same terms to describe the same concepts, some widelyaccepted definitions are found in the box. Types of Communication Communication can raise awareness, increase knowledge and motivation, and facili- tate people's actions. Communication activities include behavior change communica-tion, social mobilization, and advocacy. Behavior change (or program) communication encourages actions among target populations that directly support more effective immunization coverage and dis-ease control; for example, providing information, motivation, and job aids so thathealth workers will treat parents with respect, give information clearly, and encourageparents to bring children for vaccinations as soon as they are due. Social mobilization aims at gaining and maintaining the involvement of a broad range of groups and sectors; for example, by holding a series of meetings with repre-sentatives of private companies, other government agencies, and NGOs to discusshow they can support polio eradication as well as routine immunization. Social mobi-lization also includes mobilizing the public to participate in immunization activities. Advocacy focuses on gaining and maintaining the support of political leaders, opin- ion leaders, and other decision-makers; for example, by making presentations and pro-ducing an information packet that describes the burden of hepatitis B disease and howthis audience can support efforts to reduce it. Adapted from UNICEF and WHO, 2000 Community members plan how to mobilize mothers and children for immunization. Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II158Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior Change Communication Channels Immunization programs use numerous communication channels to reach par- ents and other target audiences, from radio and television, to folk media, tocommunity events, to counseling at health facilities. Too often, decisions aboutwhat channels to use are based on the beliefs and personal preferences ofpeople who think they know the target audience well but in fact do not. If thedecision is not based on good evidence on how to reach the audience(obtained from evaluations and/or formative research), the choice of commu-nication channels may well be inappropriate. Communication experts have found that the best channels for reachingrural people are health workers, localleaders and groups, and, in somecases, radio. It is generally not veryeffective to use print materials withlow-literacy populations or mass mediafor those with little access to televisionand other mass media. Generally, par-ents perceive health workers as acredible source of information abouthealth. Growth promotion and IMCI(Integrated Management of ChildhoodIllness) contacts provide excellentopportunities for health workers to assess a child's immunization status andthen to give needed vaccinations or advise caretakers how to get the vaccina-tions as soon as possible. Disscussions between health workers and small groups of parents can be held as part of immunization sessions and on other occasions in and outside of ahealth facility to: Address people's doubts about immunizations Identify and fill information gaps and correct misinformation Respond to questions Reinforce positive attitudes and behaviors One-on-one counseling is the best way to give parents information onwhen and where to bring their childfor the next vaccination. However,simply giving people information isnot enough; the message must beunderstood and remembered, asshown in the box. It Was Said, but Was it Understood? In a study conducted in the Northwest Frontier Province, Pakistan, healthworkers were observed telling 85% ofthe mothers when to bring their chil-dren for the next vaccination. Exitinterviews held later the same morningwith these mothers indicated that only8% remembered when they were sup-posed to return! Source: Credit: Kelley Sams, Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior ChangeMass communication media can complement the basic channel of interpersonal communication, but it is not a substitute for it and is inadequate by itself. InMozambique, the national immunization program staff developed the followingmaterials to support both interpersonal communication and mass media whenthey introduced Hep B vaccine into their routine program. On the right is an illustration of the use of flags to notify communities when and where vaccination will take place.Note the use of \"countdown\" flags to inform people that thevaccination session will be held in three days, two days,and one day. The flags demonstrate a publiccommitment by healthworkers that the ses-sion will take place,that providecommunity memberswith advance notice,and that they willannounce thesession's start.

Credit: JSI/Madagascar160Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior Change Content. The content of the communication is as important as the channel. There is ample evidence that shows that because most parents already knowthat immunizations prevent some dangerous diseases, they do not need furtherconvincing nor hear clinical details. The most essential information they need iswhen and where they should bring their child for his or her next immunization,what common side effects they might expect, and what they should do if thesedo occur. In addition, if any rumors or common misconceptions regardingimmunization are detected, they should be corrected (see Chapter 8). Advocacy and social mobilization. Advocacy and social mobilization techniques can be used to inform political leaders, community members, andpartners about upcoming events and activities and increase their participationin them. Health workers at all levels should talk with leaders and other influen-tial people individually, hold joint planning meetings and provide information-al materials. The communication techniques discussed above can also be usedto mobilize the community. Historically, social mobilization has been usedmore frequently to build support for campaigns than for routine immunization,but it is needed for both. Training to Improve Knowledge and Skills How can health workers and managers learn and improve communicationskills, including promoting behavior change on the part of parents? Training,reinforced by supervision and reporting requirements, can increase healthworkers' knowledge andimprove technical and commu-nication skills. Where there areeducational, cultural, andeconomic differences thatprevent effective communica-tion between health workersand community members,health workers may requirespecial training to recognizeand overcome these barriers.Although training can help,changes may also be neededin the organization and patient flow during vaccination sessions, as indicatedin the sample behavioral analyses on page 156. Knowledge. Like members of the public, health workers themselves some- times have misconceptions about immunization. For example, some believethat giving a child antibiotics on the same day as a vaccination will destroythe vaccine's effectiveness. Some start the vaccination series all over again if Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II161Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior Changea child comes late for a dose. Some fail to provide vaccinations because of false contraindications. These health workers need technical information,which is best acquired in a setting similar to their work environment. Health workers also need information on key immunization messages, which they can find in manuals from their country program or from internationalsources. Reading is not enough, however; people need to use knowledge inorder to retain it. Health workers also need to be confident that the health sys-tem in which they work (e.g., supervisors, vaccine supply) will support theirputting correct knowledge into practice. Technical Skills. With growing awareness of the fact that HIV/AIDS, hepati- tis B, and hepatitis C can be acquired through unsafe injections, clients andparents are beginning to watch how health workers handle needles andsyringes, and what they see can inspire confidence or fear. Health workerscan build confidence among clients and parents by mastering skills in reconsti-tuting and administering vaccines. They also need skills in such areas as fore-casting vaccine and other supply needs, organizing fixed and outreachsessions, and handling waste. These skills are best learned from people whodo them well and should be reinforced through practice. Communication Skills. Effective communication begins when a health worker starts thinking about what keeps people from coming to a healthfacility and/or what prevents them from returning. As noted above, peoplemay not get the information they need or may have unpleasant experienceswith health workers. To overcomesuch communication problems,health workers need skills inlistening, questioning, givinginstructions, and confirming thatthey are understood. These skillsare best learned by observinggood models of communicationand practicing using role playsand simulations. Supervision and OtherStrategies to SupportPositive Behavior For people to continue acting in positive ways, they need to feel that whatthey are doing is having a desired outcome and few, if any, negative conse-quences. For example, if health workers discard vaccine vials because the As part of training, health workers use role play to practice their counseling skills. Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II162Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior Change VVMs have changed color, they should be confident that they will not be pun- ished for it, but rather recognized for taking the correct action. If they immu-nize a slightly ill child according to national policy, they should know thatnational immunization policies and their own supervisors will support them. Supervision. Supervision plays a major role in supporting positive health worker performance. Supervisorscan monitor performance and iden-tify both successes and problemsand then help plan corrections.They can help health workers moni-tor the impact of their activities. Supervisors also can make sure that system supports are in place.They should provide feedback toDissemination -A Critical Step Dissemination is important! Unfortunately, after devoting substantial time and money to develop guidelines, tools, and other print or electronic documents, too many peopleand organizations then disseminate them in ways and formats that either do not reachor are not convenient for the intended audience to use. The materials often end upwarehoused at some intermediate point. A few general guidelines for more effectivedissemination are the following: Design a dissemination plan that specifies: who is supposed to use and therefore receive the materials in what quantity end users need them by what means they will be sent to the intended users who is responsible for sending them the budget needed to do so. Additionally, Use those channels that are most convenient for the audience, not those most easily used by the sender. Ask audience members what channels and formats are easiest for them to use. When feasible, make resources available in more than one format (e.g., print and electronic) and via multiple distribution channels. Do not rely on electronic formats alone for dissemination. Do not depend on colleagues to take on the dissemination burden; no matter how well intentioned, they are likely to be too busy to make this a priority. Monitor dissemination - that the material is reaching the intended people and that they feel it is appropriate and useful for them. Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II163Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior Changehealth workers, coach them, model positive behavior, and include interperson- al communication skills in performance evaluations. Recognition. Parents and health workers alike feel motivated when others notice and praise good performance. Some countries formally recognize afully immunized child by using a rubber stamp to mark a seal of completionon the child's vaccination card or giving a diploma, as shown in the examplesfrom Kenya and Madagascar. 164Immunization Essentials Chapter 9: The Role of Behavior Change System Support. Changes in individual behavior do not result in improved services and higher coverage without complementary actions in other parts ofthe health system. For example, managers must make sure that vaccines, injec-tion equipment, and other supplies are available to meet increased demandcreated by social mobilization and health promotion activities. The tableshows how communication activities and other interventions might interact tosolve the drop-out problem discussed in earlier examples.

It's simply not good enough.\" - Harlan Cleveland As an investment in health, immunization is widely regarded as a \"best buy.\" Immunization not only protects individuals and populations at low cost, butalso provides a platform for delivering other health interventions, such as vita-min A. As described in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993,\"In most developing countries...an 'EPI Plus' cluster of interventions in the firstyear of life would have the highest cost-effectiveness of any health measureavailable in the world today.\" As one of the most effective and affordable ways to control infectious dis- eases, immunization should be a financial priority for national governmentsand donor agencies. If the financial commitment to immunization services wasreduced, the subsequent increase in morbidity and mortality would have seri-ous social and economic consequences. Therefore, immunization clearlyrequires a sustained commitment even though the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases has been significantly reduced. Ultimately, the primary responsibility for ensuring sufficient financing for immu- nization services rests with governments of developing countries. Since nation-al governments alone may not be able to provide all of the required funding,it is a shared responsibility of the central government, district governments,and communities to identify and mobilize the necessary resources to sustainsafe and effective immunization services. Since infectious diseases do not honor national borders, and the full protection of any child depends on the protection of all children, donor organizationsshould share the burden of making services available and introducing newvaccines. This shared obligation to immunize all the world's children isembodied in the GAVI definition for sustainable financing (GAVI, 2001): \"Although self-sufficiency is the ultimate goal, in the nearer term sustainable financing is the ability of a country to mobilize andefficiently use domestic and supplementary external resourceson a reliable basis to achieve current and future target levels ofimmunization performance in terms of access, utilization, qual-ity, safety and equity.\"168Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and FinancingThe challenge of sustaining the resources for immunization is a task that falls on many groups. National policy makers need to prioritize immunization serv-ices so that they compete successfully with other health services, donors needto provide support in ways that eliminate funding uncertainties and avoiddependencies, and program managers need to take advantage of servicedelivery efficiencies to minimize costs. All of these partners should assessneeds, calculate costs, monitor expenditures, arrange financing, and makeefficient use of resources without losing sight of the immunization programgoal to minimize the impact of vaccine-preventable diseases. What Does It Cost to Provide VaccinationServices? Given frequent changes in the cost of new vaccines, new technologies, service delivery strategies, labor, and the variation among countries, it is difficult tostate the actual cost of vaccination in absolute terms. However, it is useful toexamine some of the elements that go into the cost of immunizing a child.Cost estimates, or budgets, usually include two categories: capital costs,which last one year or more, and recurrent costs, which cover items that areconsumed in a year or less or services that are provided and paid for regular-ly. Some examples of the types of costs included in these two categories are: The table on the next page shows routine immunization expenditures in Morocco, Bangladesh, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. This cost analysis indicates severalcommon trends across the three countries: Personnel costs are over one-half of the budget. Vaccine costs account for the next highest share of the budget. Note that these costs are for the six traditional antigens only. Injection safety and social mobilization costs may be under-represented.CAPITAL COSTS RECURRENT COSTS Building space Vehicles Equipment: refrigera- tors, cold boxes,vaccine carriers, steamsterilizers, incinerators Long-term training (pre-service) Vaccines Building operation and maintenance Transportation: vehicle operation and maintenance, fuel, freight charges, fares for public transport, per diems Supplies: needles and syringes, ice packs, safety boxes, fuel for refrigerators, reporting forms Personnel In-service training Materials for training, health promotion, social mobilization Contracts with commercial or nonprofit organizations for training, social mobilization, fleet management169Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and FinancingThese data provide historical information on the actual, but not necessarily optimal, levels of expenditures. The ideal level of funding needed for each lineitem should be determined by monitoring program performance and allocat-ing sufficient funding to ensure that immunization targets are being met.

To develop a comprehensive immunization budget, managers need to calcu-late the full cost of all program elements that make up a specific immunizationservice activity, even those that may not be obvious. Some common programelements that should be budgeted include the following: Vaccine Cold chain Needles, syringes, safety boxes, waste management Disease surveillance Supervision Training Management information systems Social mobilization, communications, and advocacy Each of these elements has several cost components that should beincluded when preparing a budget.For example, a budget for vaccineprocurement should include not onlythe cost of vaccines, but also freight,insurance, and customs clearance.Program areas such as cold chain,disease surveillance, and trainingrequire expenditures for transporta-tion, supplies, materials, and perdiems. In addition to such recurrentcosts, managers should remember toinclude costs for conducting specialstudies (such as EPI reviews or injec-tion safety studies) and developing,producing, and disseminating materi-als (such as training materials or coldchain manuals). The following table illustrates the types of expenses that need tobe considered in just one program function. Posters for national polio immunization days on a boat for reaching distantpopulations.

For example, one country's immu- nization program, which plannedto utilize volunteers for social mobi-lization activities, budgeted for thebulk purchase of bicycles so as toprovide one bicycle per volunteer.However, the manufacturer deliv-ered the bicycles unassembled.Local bicycle \"repairmen\" had tobe hired to properly assemble thebicycles, which added significant,unforeseen expenses. This requireddiverting funds away from other pro-gram areas. The box below notes costs that are commonly overlooked in the development of immunization budgets. To avoid overlooking necessary costs, partners sup-porting immunization in a given country should jointly develop common immu-nization plans that cover all aspects of the program, including equipment andsupplies. This approach helps to ensure the compatibility of spare parts, identi-fy long-term repair and maintenance needs, and simplify training plans forpersonnel who use the equipment and supplies. Commonly Overlooked and Under-Budgeted Items The following items tend to be overlooked in budgeting for immunization services. Spare parts, tools, fuel for equipment, and labor costs for repair and mainte- nance Waste disposal Per diem and travel expenses for outreach, surveillance, and supervision Public announcements and other communications for routine immunization Replacing capital equipment, such as vehicles and refrigerators It has been estimated that recurrent costs account for approximately 70% of the lifetime cost of a piece of equipment! A simple donation of a piece of equipmentcan generate an expensive legacy for the recipient. Credit: WHO Budgets should include the cost of vehiclerepair and replacement.173Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and FinancingCosts in Transition: Vaccine and Waste Management Vaccines. One budget line item that needs special attention is vaccine. Dramatic changes are taking place in the vaccine industry: Fewer manufacturers are producing new vaccines. Manufacturers are developing new vaccines and new combinations of vaccines. Periodic shortages, even of traditional vaccines, may emerge. Each of these changes will be felt in the price and availability of vaccine. While the dynamic vaccine market presents a significant opportunity toimprove the public health impact of immunization, it also underscores theneed for careful financial planning to ensure a steady supply of the necessaryvaccines. Country program managers need to be aware of these changes inthe global market and work closely with national financial planners to ensurethat the resources are available to meet all vaccine requirements. Waste Management. As the field of immunization evolves, some program- matic areas increase in importance, resulting in funding needs that had notpreviously been fully recognized. One such area is that of waste managementfor contaminated needles and syringes. Increased efforts to reduce the spreadof HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and other blood-borne pathogens have led to moreattention to the area of injection safety, including waste management. Becausethere is no standard approach for waste management and practical solutionsto the problem are still being sought, there is no standard unit cost to includein budgets. Nevertheless, managers should prepare plans and budgets thataddress waste management to the extent possible, basing budget estimates onlocal circumstances and the best information available. Example of the Impact of New Vaccines on Vaccine Costs One African country decided to introduce pentavalent DTP-Hep B+Hib vaccine into its routine schedule. This decision raised the total annual cost of vaccines for the countryfrom just under $1 million to about $8 million. The line item for vaccines jumped from26% to 60% of the total immunization budget. An important challenge is to ensure that this sudden increase in the vaccine line item does not displace other budget line items. If vaccines are paid for at the cost of coldchain replacement or fuel for outreach services, the impact of the new vaccines can bedevastating to the overall program. New vaccine costs must be met with newresources.174Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and FinancingHow Can Different Service Delivery Strategies Affect Cost? A variety of service delivery strategies are needed to reach different segments of the population. Some strategies that are less costly may be more appropri-ate and effective for reaching some groups, while other, more costly strategiesare required to provide services to dispersed, or otherwise hard-to-reachgroups. At first glance, the less costly strategies may seem to represent moreefficient use of resources; however, efficiency includes the dimensions of bothcost and effectiveness. If providing services at a low cost does not achieve thedesired programmatic goal, then it is neither efficient nor cost-effective. Thus,it may be necessary to spend more money in order to achieve the desired tar-get for the hard-to-reach segments of the population. The following examplefrom one African country demonstrates this concept. Maximizing the use of immunization resources requires more than accurately assessing the comparative costs of line items, service delivery strategies, oractivities. Planners also need to weigh the effectiveness of each strategy.What proportion of the target population will be reached? What is the likelyimpact of delivery strategies on other aspects of the health system and on vari-ous public health objectives? Location and Tactics Affect the Cost and Effectiveness of Immunization Catchment Area 1: High Cost Catchment Area 2: Low Cost Key characteristics of the area Scattered population Cost of transport highKey characteristics of the area Densely settled population Cost of transport low Team organization and tactics The team was large.It provided services at many posts that were far apart. It returned to headquarters several times every month for re-supply. It identified eligible clients, traced clients who did not use the services, and followed up on drop-outs.Team organization and tactics The team was small.It provided services at a few posts that were short distances apart. It returned to headquarters once a month for re-supply. Community members enumerated eligible clients for the team, traced clients who did not use the services, and followed up on drop-outs. Adapted from Foster et al.,1998175Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and FinancingHow Can Resources Be Used Efficiently and Effectively? A critical consideration in any planning and budgeting exercise is the effec-tive and efficient use of funds. Efficiency implies a minimum of expense andwaste for reaching the desired results. However, as described earlier, to reachtheir public health objectives of controlling disease, some immunization pro-grams must spend more money per mother or child than other programs. Thusthere should be a careful balance between efficiency and effectiveness,because systems that minimize expense to the detriment of effectiveness arenot efficient. For example, if there is only one opportunity to immunize a childfor a disease such as measles, but this means opening a multi-dose vial foronly one child, the public health importance of immunizing the child shouldoutweigh the cost inefficiency of opening a vial for only that child. Efficiency in immunization programming can be achieved in many ways. Reducing waste is one important way, as is organizing services so that theyachieve the desired impact with the minimum of cost. Efficiency can also beaddressed through decentralizing decision making so as to allow for moretimely and appropriate local response to problems. However, this may requireinvestments to build the technical and managerial capacity of local andCosts of Supplemental Immunization Activities Budgets for special diseasecontrol initiatives andoutbreak campaigns containthe same line items as budg-ets for routine vaccination,but the proportions and theoverall size of the budgetsare different. Costs forexpanded outreach anddoor-to-door vaccinationstrategies are generallyhigher than andper diem. Additionally, costsfor social and mediaare as tocreate broad awarenessabout the campaign. Credit: WHO176Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and Financingregional personnel. Many health care systems are organized inefficiently in that they depend heavily on centralized authority to initiate local action. Betterorganization of services can lead to significant savings in costs; for example,well-publicized and appropriately scheduled outreach sessions can reachlarge numbers of clients. The flow of funds to where they are needed is an important aspect of efficien- cy. In order to ensure their effective use, resources need to move in a timelymanner to the level in the health system where they are required. Bottlenecksin this flow seriously impair the efficiency of the program and can significantlyreduce impact. ICCs may be able to play a useful role in identifying and tak-ing steps to remove such bottlenecks. Some other ways to increase the efficiency of available resources that are addressed in this book include: Reducing drop-outs (see Chapters 3, 4, and 9) Reducing missed opportunities (see Chapter 3) Including other interventions during outreach, for example, vitamin A sup- plementation (see Chapters 3 and 12) Scheduling sessions according to the needs of the target population (Chapter 3) Limiting vaccine wastage by protecting vaccines from freezing, using vac- cine vial monitors, and implementing the policy on opened multi-dosevials (see Chapter 6) Designing activities such as disease surveillance and social mobilization so that they serve objectives in addition to the immediate intention, forexample, social mobilization for polio campaigns should also inform moth-ers about other routine immunization services (see Chapters 8 and 9). What Does It Cost to Reach New Targets? Most ministries of health and immunization managers seek to improve vacci-nation services by increasing coverage, adding new vaccines, improvinginjection safety, reducing drop-outs, or strengthening disease surveillance.Each of these improvements carries with it costs that need to be reflected inimmunization budgets, as detailed in the example on the next page. 177Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and FinancingCost Implications of Increasing Vaccination Coverage by Expanding Outreach Services Reaching new targets requires careful and detailed budgeting. Regardless of the new target or the strategy used to achieve that target, there are common steps to follow inorder to budget for all components of the strategy. These steps are described belowand illustrated by an example using hypothetical data for strengthening outreach serv-ices to increase coverage. Step 1 What objective are you trying to achieve? Increase coverage Step 2 How will the objective be achieved? Strengthen outreach Step 3 What will be the strategy for strengthening outreach? Vaccinators will be provided with bicycles, equipment, and per diem to conduct out- reach in under-served areas. Step 4 What are the costs associated with this strategy? Transportation - bicycles, repair kits Transportation - maintenance, spare parts Per diem Vaccine carriers and ice packs Training Supervision Step 5 What assumptions need to be considered in developing a budget for the strategy? Number of health facilities and outreach teams (500) New material needed for each health facility 1 bicycle ($100) 1 vaccine carrier and ice packs ($15) 1 bicycle repair kit ($10) One day of training for health workers at the district office (50 districts x $200) Number of villages to be covered with outreach services (5,000) One outreach session per village per month Per diem ($1) On average 10 villages per health center Fuel for district supervision of health facilities (2 visits per year) Replacement of 10% of bicycles per year Maintenance of bicycles per year ($10 per bicycle)178Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and FinancingStep 6 What factors need to be taken into account in order to develop a multi-year budget?

Important, but less obvious, costs associated with new vaccine introduction include additional coldchain capacity, training of health workers in cor-rect vaccine administration, and public educationto inform parents about the added benefits of thenew vaccine. Immunization managers who plan for the expansion of the program need to work closelywith financial planners who budget for theoverall health sector costs. Poorly conceivedand planned expansion will most likely fall shortof goals and undermine confidence in theimmunization program. The actual and full costof any change to the immunization program mustbe carefully calculated and presented todecision-makers. Credit: WHO180Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and FinancingHow Can Vaccination Services Be Financed? It is important to identify adequate and sustainable sources of financing in order for immunization programs to be effective. Financing needs to be suffi-cient, provide for all appropriate vaccines, ensure that immunizations aredelivered safely, and reach all the children in the country. Today's fundingenvironment allows health sector officials to choose from a wide variety ofoptions in selecting appropriate financing mechanisms for immunization. In addition to these financing sources, there are mechanisms such as revolving funds, which do not necessarily provide funding but which allow countries toovercome obstacles such as the need for hard currency or advance paymentfor vaccines. Some financing mechanisms, while appearing to be effective solutions to fund- ing problems, may have unintended consequences that actually work to thedetriment of the immunization program. One example is user fees. Each type of financing has advantages and constraints that need to be care- fully assessed with respect to the structure of the immunization program and itsintended goals. Along with planning and management, financing is a criticaldeterminant of whether programs reach their goals. Careful examination ofeach financing mechanism's characteristics is needed before selecting anappropriate strategy. It is recommended that a financing strategy be evaluatedbased on the following criteria: Does the mechanism: Promote equity Achieve efficiency (cost effectiveness) Provide resources in an adequate, timely, and reliable mannerUser Fees Many countries have experimented with charging user fees for immunization in a vari- ety of circumstances with mixed results. Reviews of such experience have found thatfunds raised through user fees are not necessarily used for intended purposes, and insome settings, user fees were found to act as a disincentive to seeking immunizationservices. These findings have led the Board of GAVI to issue the following statement: \"The GAVI Board recommends that in the absence of compelling country or regional data unequivocally documenting their value, user fees should not be levied in publiclyfinanced national immunization services.\"181Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and Financing Engender accountability Encourage maximum self-sufficiency While each country is different in areas such as public health policy, regulato- ry structure, governance, macroeconomic context, and its relationship withexternal donors, this table provides some insight into how each mechanismwould perform in light of these criteria.

Established in 1999 with a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and bol-stered by subsequent contributions from many donor governments, the VaccineFund is the funding arm of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization(GAVI). GAVI encourages the strengthening of national immunization pro-grams and increased coverage through many approaches, for example byadvocating for financial commitment to immunization and providing support inthe form of grants.Characteristics of Financing Options: A Summary (cont'd.)

HIPC II (Highly Indebted Poor Countries II) is a debt relief program adminis-tered by the World Bank that was introduced in 1999 by the Group of Sevenindustrialized countries to support poverty reduction activities. In some HIPC IIcountries, resources no longer targeted for debt relief have been set aside forimmunization services. SWAps (Sector-Wide Approaches) are arrangements in which external donors pool their funds and direct them to the overall health budget rather than tospecific programs. The recipient government works with the donors to set pri-orities and decide how the funds will be distributed. Many developing coun-tries prefer this approach because it gives them decision-making authority forthe use of the funds. What Needs to Be Done to Obtain Funding? The primary responsibility for identifying and mobilizing funding for vaccina-tion services rests with the governments of developing countries. These govern-ments need to take the leading role to secure a sustainable level of funding,from both domestic and external sources, to ensure the achievement of thecountry's immunization goals. Governments can consider several actions topromote sustainable financing. The Vaccine Fund The Vaccine Fund, the financial arm of GAVI, was set up to strengthen basic immu- nization services and support the introduction of new and underused vaccines. TheVaccine Fund purchases vaccines ( i.e., Hep B, Hib, and yellow fever) along withauto-disable syringes and safety boxes and provides financial support for immuniza-tion service strengthening. It does not pay for traditional vaccines for the routine immu-nization system, although it does pay for combination vaccines that contain DTP. All countries with populations under 150 million and per capita GNP less than $1000 - over 70 countries - are eligible for support from the Vaccine Fund. Separate proce-dures have been negotiated to provide assistance to China, India, and Indonesia,whose populations exceed this guideline. Countries must meet four conditions toreceive initial support: 1. The country must have a functioning Inter-agency Coordinating Committee (or an equivalent collaborative mechanism) that focuses on immunization to ensure localcoordination and accountability. 2. The country must submit a recent assessment of immunization services.3. The country must submit a coherent, multi-year plan for immunization.4. The country must have an injection safety plan. Other requirements for renewed funding include the provision of financial sustainability plans and evidence of responsible and effective use of funds. Source: GAVI 185Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and FinancingThese include: Develop a targeted program to reduce barriers to access through new delivery strategies, including involvement of the private sector, as appro-priate. Promote allocation of resources on the basis of cost-effectiveness and pub- lic finance principles. Develop and implement a targeted program to reduce waste, with quanti- tative endpoints. Establish legal mandates for baseline funding of national immunization programs. Engage development partners in informed discussion of resource require- ments, and seek structured commitments to fill in key funding gaps. Earmark funds and establish performance targets for sub-national entities. A critical step that every country can take to mobilize resources for immuniza- tion is to develop a multi-yearplan. This plan should bebased on input from all part-ners. It should address opera-tional deficiencies, defineprogrammatic priorities (suchas increasing coverage, intro-duction of andreduction drop-out realistic targets,identify necessary inputs(such as technical and managerialtools), and present a clearbudget that takes intoaccount all capital and recurrent costs, including those overlooked costs men-tioned earlier in this chapter. The plan needs to include a budget that takes intoaccount all the costs associated with achieving new targets. In conjunction with the multi-year plan, countries should develop a financial sustainability plan. This is a plan that assesses the financial issues that thecountry faces and defines a process for mobilizing the necessary resourcesneeded to achieve the country's immunization objectives. As with the multi-year plan, the financial sustainability plan should be prepared in close coordi-nation with partner organizations through the ICC. Credit: Kelley Sams, BASICS II186Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and FinancingGAVI notes that a good financial sustainability plan should: Serve as an advocacy tool Generate a clear picture of the financing situation and challenges Develop relevant, realistic, and specific strategies and actions supporting financial sustainability Identify process and outcome indicators to measure progress toward achieving financial sustainability Financial planning should always take into account the financial needs at all levels of the health system. A plan that is fully funded for national-level activi-ties is not necessarily fully funded at the operational level of the district. Afinancial plan should be built from the ground up, accounting for all costsrequired to meet program goals. All levels should provide technical reviewand feedback prior to finalization. The role of the ICC is very important to this process (see pages 33-35). Ministry of health officials and donors need to be able to communicate openlyand effectively with each other to ensure sustained support for the health sec-tor and immunization specifically. Donors need to be active participants in thisprocess and, when needed, draw on technical expertise to review plans andsuggest possible approaches. MOH officials need to understand the fundingcycles of donors and what constraints they are under in providing assistance.Many donors are on one-year funding cycles that make it difficult for them togive long-term commitments of support. An open dialogue between donorsand MOH officials needs to be a priority for both sides in order to mobilizethe resources needed to achieve the immunization goals. Sustainability of Immunization Financing A successful immunization program should reach every child in the first year of life, year after year. A sustained financial commitment is needed for immu-nization programs to succeed in preventing disease. Time-specific, short-termtargets may help programs focus attention and funding. However, achieve-ments also need to be sustained beyond the target dates. To do so, fundinglevels must be maintained. The level of required financial commitment increas-es as higher goals are set and new, more expensive vaccines are introducedinto the schedule. In the past, sustainability was equated with self-sufficiency. However, GAVI has moved the immunization community past that point toward a new conceptof sustainability that embodies the following principles: It is a shared commitment and a shared responsibility of both governments and their development partners.187Immunization Essentials Chapter 10: Costs and Financing It requires matching financing for expanding program objectives. It includes the concept of adequate and reliable financial resources, focus- ing not only on the quantity of funds but also on how well they reach theplaces where they are needed. It is related to both mobilization and efficient use of financial resources. It is desirable, but difficult, to measure sustainability in a way that captures all the important determinants and outcomes. GAVI has worked with countriesand international partners to develop and test a limited number of sustainabili-ty indicators that should allow both the detection of progress within a countryand comparisons among countries. Sustainability also has political, technical, and organizational dimensions. Immunization programs need to maintain a high level of political commitmentto ensure that appropriate policies are adopted and that the allocationof resources is adequate to provide a complete range of services to allchildren. In addition, programs need to use the appropriate technologies andpractices for the setting, they need proper training and supervision programs,and they need to be organizationally stable enough to provide services on acontinual basis. Achievable objectives and sound planning and management are essential if sustainability is to be achieved. Public demand can also contribute. Publicdemand for safe and effective services will help generate the political supportneeded to sustain immunization programs and provide the necessary level offunding. Every aspect of good program management is critical to the sustain-ability of immunization and the development of secure and stable funding. Sustainability is a shared commitment among all those who support immuniza- tion as an effective and important tool in the control of childhood morbidityand mortality. Immunization has moved from being a local responsibility to aglobal responsibility: it therefore requires a sustained global commitment thatwill ensure that all children receive its benefits. The Director of WHO, the Executive Director of UNICEF and the President of the World Bank noted that commitment when they stated: \"Together we truly can deliver a 'global public good', a bene- fit for all, regardless of national borders, by making a con-certed effort to use the tools that medically promise so much.Immunization remains one of the best investments in healththat is within our grasp.

Changing one aspect of a system has broad consequences, so anticipating theeffects and preparing the system to accommodate them can mean the differencebetween a positive outcome and chaos. Before deciding to incorporate newvaccines into their immunization program, managers should assess the diseaseburden and competing public health priorities. They should estimate the cost ofintroducing and sustaining the new vaccine, identify funding sources, and ana-lyze the impact on the health system as a whole. Once a change has beenimplemented, monitoring and evaluation are required to assess progress andidentify any problems or unintended effects. The introduction of new technologies should be treated with the same care. Before making a decision and subsequent plans, program managers shouldcarefully consider the need for the technology, its likely benefits, its costs, thesystem changes needed to introduce and accommodate it, and how its usewill be monitored. If carefully managed, the introduction process provides an opportunity to affirm the importance of immunization, motivate health workers and members of thecommunity, improve services, and ultimately serve broader health objectives. Introducing New Vaccines The process of introducing vaccines into a national immunization program is complex, as discussed in the following summary of key decisions to be madeand factors that should be considered. Each of these factors is discussed inmore detail in other parts of this guide. Policies A new vaccine or technology may require changes in national policies as wellas guidelines to support the implementation of those policies. For example, theimmunization schedule usually has to be amended and guidelines introducedon vaccine storage, injection techniques, reconstitution, and the use of openvials, among other matters. The revised policies should take into account boththe epidemiology of the target disease and the feasibility of putting these poli-192Immunization Essentials Chapter 11: New Vaccines and Technologiescies into practice. For hepatitis B vac- cination, for example, the local epi-demiology should determine whethera birth dose is needed, but considera-tion is also needed as to how thebirth dose will be delivered to new-borns. A new or changed deliverystrategy may itself require revisions inpolicies or guidelines if health person-nel are to take on different responsibil-ities; for example, if traditional birthattendants are to administer the birthdose of Hep B vaccine. Service Delivery Strategies In introducing new vaccines, every effort should be made to maintain the existing vaccination schedule in order to avoid creating additional visits thatare not absolutely necessary. This approach helps minimize confusion andinconvenience for both caretakers and health workers. The creation of an opti-mal service delivery schedule for vaccination sessions is best determined atthe district or sub-district level, taking into account the typical vaccination ses-sion size and the times and places that caretakers find most convenient. Thesefactors can help reduce drop-out rates, contributing to full immunization andthe efficient and effective use of all vaccines. For \"traditional\" as well asnewer, more expensive vaccines, a balance must be struck between achievinglow wastage rates and offering vaccination sessions frequently enough toavoid prolonged exposure to the disease-causing organisms. Target Population When a new vaccine or vaccine combination is added to the routine sched-ule, managers and epidemiologists must identify the age group to receive thevaccine (see Chapters 4 and 5). In the start-up year of a new children's vac-cine, there are two cohorts to be considered: Children between 0 and 11 months of age at the beginning of the year. Children born during the start-up year (the birth cohort). In principle, the decision about whether to include the two cohorts or only the birth cohort should be based on the age distribution of the disease, publicexpectations, availability of the new vaccine, practicality, and cost. In reality,however, funding restrictions are critical. For example, the Vaccine Fund sup-ports the purchase of vaccines for the birth cohort only.

Credit: WHO193Immunization Essentials Chapter 11: New Vaccines and TechnologiesIf the vaccine being introduced is a combination vaccine (e.g., DTP-Hep B), which includes a new vaccine (Hep B) and an old one (DTP), managers mustdecide what to do with children who have already been vaccinated with oneor two doses of the old vaccine. Using DTP-Hep B as an example, there are at least three options for phasing in the new vaccine: One alternative is to give the new combination vaccine and then stop as soon as a child has received a total of three doses of DTP. This means thatsome children will be only partially protected with Hep B vaccine. A second option is to continue giving the new combination vaccine until a child has received the full series of Hep B. This means that some childrenreceive extra doses of DTP. A third option is to use monovalent Hep B for children who have already begun DTP and use the new com-bination vaccine for those whohave not begun the DTP series.However, ordering, storing, andhandling more than one formula-tion of vaccine introduces substan-tial logistical and otherprogrammatic complexities. Vaccine Supply The availability of a vaccine may be limited during the first years after itsintroduction, as has been the casewith new combination vaccines (seeChapter 5). The phasing out of an old vaccine and introduction of a new com-bination vaccine has to be timed carefully to avoid over- or under-stocking of Are Stocks of Traditional Vaccines at Risk? Historically, the availability of traditional EPI vaccines has been more than adequate to meet demand. In the last few years, however, ensuring the continuous supply of thesevaccines has become a serious problem in developing and industrialized countriesalike. Fewer manufacturers are producing vaccines, the supply has been reduced, andprices are increasing. With the introduction of new formulations and combinations of vaccines, the dynamics of vaccine supply are changing. Program managers and donors need to take this intoaccount as they plan for and provide long-term support to immunization services.Although the benefit of these new vaccines is widely recognized, there are also con-cerns about maintaining consistent and dependable services to the public.

Immunization program managers and ICC members should develop contingency plans in the event that the anticipated vaccine formula-tions do not arrive in the required quantities at the specified time. Cold Chain and Logistics Immunization program managers must decide what vial sizes to order (see Chapters 5 and 6). For example, monovalent Hep B vaccine comes in one-,two-, six-, and 10-dose vial sizes. The most appropriate vial size should bebased on the number of children at a typical immunization session, the cost ofvarious presentations, storage requirements, and other operational factors. Staff at all levels of the system (including the drivers who deliver the vaccines) may need new instructions about vaccine storage. These instructions shouldinclude the protection of both freeze-sensitive and heat-sensitive vaccines. The addition of a vaccine to the immunization schedule may require increased quantities of syringes and needles. The need for such equipment must be esti-mated and delivery schedules planned to ensure continuous supplies. Morespace may be needed to store auto-disable syringes and needles and safetyboxes. Vaccine arrival reports, stock control records, and requisition formsmay have to be revised. Disease Surveillance Program managers and epidemiologists need to decide what should bereported about the \"new\" disease, who should report such information, andhow often (see Chapter 8). Special training should be provided to enablehealth workers to recognize and discuss the symptoms of diseases that are notoften seen or diseases that cannot be diagnosed on the basis of symptomsalone. For example, health workers need to know that jaundice is a symptomnot only of hepatitis B but also of other forms of hepatitis and of yellow fever.Therefore, they should be aware that the only reliable way to detect hepatitisB infection is through serologic testing. Communication When a new vaccine is introduced, immunization programs should provideneeded information to two main target audiences via appropriate channels.First, health workers need technical information on the disease and vaccine sothat they can administer it correctly and can provide essential information tocaretakers. On the other hand, parents or other caretakers need more conciseinformation, including the name of the vaccine, its benefits (in brief), the vacci-nation schedule, and possible side effects. For the most part, health workersthemselves are a primary source of information for par ents, so it is especially important that health workers are adequately prepared to advise parents andaddress their concerns. 195Immunization Essentials Chapter 11: New Vaccines and TechnologiesTraining All of these changes mean that health workers, supervisors, and others need new information and, sometimes, new skills (see Chapter 9). Managers willneed to identify who needs training, in what, for how long, and by whom.Job aids and supervisory skills should be developed or upgraded to reinforcethe training. Financing Introduction of new vaccines requires additional funding. To help bridge theinitial resource gap, in early 2002 the GAVI Board approved the allocation ofa fixed amount of $100,000 to each country approved to receive support forintroducing new and underused vaccines. These funds help pay for changesassociated with their introduction. The national government, with the assis-tance of ICC partners, is expected to make additional resources available forensuring the continuous use of the new vaccines. Planning A plan is needed to manage the introduction process. Planning should beginsix to 12 months before the vaccine is to be introduced. The schedule shownon the following page, which was developed for the introduction of pentava-lent vaccine (DTP-Hep B + Hib), illustrates the many steps and time needed. Inthis example, note that planning began more than six months before the vac-cine was introduced.Hepatitis B: Inform but Don't Confuse In introducing a new vaccine, immunization programs should provide essential infor- mation that the public needs to be able to make informed decisions. However, provid-ing excessive technical information is not necessary and may even confuse people. In the case of hepatitis B, the technical story is quite complicated. Often acquired early in life, the infection is usually asymptomatic in children, who may however, becomecarriers. In the 25% or so of carriers that do contract hepatitis B-related disease, thisusually happens only decades later. Moreover, if publicity surrounding the introductionof Hep B vaccine discusses jaundice, cancers, and other symptoms associated withhepatitis, the public might expect the vaccine to prevent all such conditions. Because of the difficulty of clearly explaining such complicated and subtle information, it is recommended that immunization programs provide only general information onthe disease in public communication, while thoroughly preparing health workers toanswer people's detailed questions. 196Immunization Essentials Chapter 11: New Vaccines and TechnologiesPlanning for the Introduction of Pentavalent Vaccine Activity Area 2001 2002 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Training Development of training materials Conduct TOT for central and district level Training of District Health Management Teams Training of health workers, vaccinators and community resource persons Training of clinicians Social mobilization Development, translation and production of IEC materials Distribution of IEC materials Advocacy and social mobilization meetings - central level - district level - sub-district and lower levels Sensitization of health professionals, MOH officials, jour-nalists and media operators Intensified district-based mass media campaigns Launching of vaccine Vaccines & injection equipment Place orders for vaccines & A-D syringes Procure vehicle (trailer) for vaccine distribution Arrival of vaccine into the country Distribution to regions/districts Distribution to health units Introduction of vaccine Planning Development of micro-plans - central level - district level Meetings of the National Task Force Production of guidelines for district micro-planning197Immunization Essentials Chapter 11: New Vaccines and TechnologiesPlanning for the Introduction of Pentavalent Vaccine (Cont'd) Adapted from UNEPI, Uganda, 2000 Activity Area 2001 2002 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Cold Chain Assessment of cold chain capacity Done Procurement of cold chain equipment On-going Distribution of equipment On-going Cold chain maintenance On-going Refill and distribute gas for fridges On-going Monitoring Incorporate Hep B and Hib into existing HMIS forms Introduce Hep B and Hib in the existing immunization schedule Print reviewed cards Monitoring district preparation activities Monitoring implementation of new vaccineintroduction Develop monitoring tool for adverse events Monitor adverse events Surveillance Hib rapid assessment Done Setting up Hib sentinel site Carry out Hep B baseline survey Done Establish Hep B laboratory at national laboratory Develop and disseminate case definitions and guide-lines for Hib and Hep B Orient/train surveillance focal points, records assis-tants, & HMIS persons in Hib/Hep B surveillance Procure computers, e-mail for Hib and Hep B sen-tinel laboratories198Immunization Essentials Chapter 11: New Vaccines and TechnologiesMonitoring and the Information System When a new vaccine is added to the schedule, new or revised forms (includ- ing tally sheets and monthly coverage reports) are required for reporting dis-ease incidence and coverage, and vaccination cards usually have to berevised (see Chapter 4). This may be an opportunity to improve the overallinformation system. For example, managers may decide to monitor specificinformation that has not been routinely collected, such as the use and disposalof auto-disable syringes. In the first year after introducing a new vaccine, it is particularly difficult to accurately monitor coverage for that vaccine because of changes resultingfrom the introduction process. For example, the vaccine may be introduced atdifferent times in different parts of the country. Revised vaccination cards,record-keeping forms, and recording procedures may be put in place over thecourse of several months; this can lead to a lack of uniformity in reporting dur-ing the transitional period. Vaccines in Development The expanding universe of vaccine development offers the potential to preventadditional diseases and improve the ease and safety of vaccine administra-tion. However, it may require decades before some of the most exciting devel-opments are proven safe and effective, and are available at affordable prices. The following vaccines for children in developing countries are at various stages of development: Meningococcal meningitis Pneumococcal pneumonia Rotavirus (a major cause of diarrhea) Japanese encephalitis MalariaApproximate vaccine development time 199Immunization Essentials Chapter 11: New Vaccines and TechnologiesAvailable Vaccines Not Widely Used in Developing Countries Effectiveness and Limitations of Available Vaccines Polysaccharide vaccine is not very effective in children under two years of age.

A 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinethat protects infants is on trial in Africa. Iftrials go well, a license could be grantedby 2006. Work is in progress to improve the effective-ness of recently developed vaccines, limitunwanted side effects, and lower costs.Newer kinds of vaccines also are underdevelopment.

The major features ofthese diseases and the status of vaccine development are summarized inthe preceding table. Research is under way to develop vaccines against malaria, HIV, and tubercu- losis, all of which are major causes of mortality. It is impossible to predictwhen these vaccines will be available for use on a large scale. New Technologies Immunization services rely on technologies for storing, monitoring, and admin- istering vaccines, and for disposing of waste. As the introduction of the vac-cine vial monitor (VVM) has demonstrated, even relatively simple devices cancreate major changes in how services are delivered. Some of the technologiesunder development are described below. Needle-Free (or Jet) Injectors These operate by ejecting a high-pres-sure stream of vaccine that penetratesthe skin when the injector is heldagainst it. Use of these injectors elimi-nates sharps waste. Work is underway to reduce any risk of cross-con-tamination that may be caused bysuccessive use. Needle Removal andStorage The type of auto-disable (A-D)syringes that are used in immuniza-tion programs have a needle that ispermanently fixed to the syringe. Thiscreates more sharps waste than steril-izable needles and syringes. Becausethe needle poses a much greaterdanger in the waste stream than thesyringe, removing the needle andstoring it safely eliminates the mosthazardous component. Needleremoval and storage technologies,such as point-of-use needle removal,are under development. There is some Credit: PATH Credit: PATH202Immunization Essentials Chapter 11: New Vaccines and Technologiescontroversy as to whether the benefits of such devices in greatly reducing the volume of sharps waste and securely storing contaminated needles is offset bythe disadvantage of adding extra handling steps for health workers in remov-ing the needles. As described in Chapter 7, there is still the need for destruc-tion of both the syringes and needles. Vaccine Preservation New technologies are being applied to improve the thermostability of vac-cines. These promise to reduce the reliance on the cold chain, and therebyincrease the accessibility of vaccines to people living in remote areas. Auto-Reconstitution A process is being developed to link freeze-dried vaccine and diluent so thatthe mixing and injection steps are combined. This technology could reduce therisks of contamination and loss of efficacy in reconstituted vaccines, but is like-ly to increase the need for storage space. Improved Rapid Field Diagnostic Tests Researchers are working on simple tests for rapidly diagnosing diseases suchas measles and identifying high-risk areas and populations for tetanus. Suchtools will help planners decide what prevention strategies to use and where toconcentrate scarce resources. A New Use for a Household Technology Multi-dose vials from which at least one dose of vaccine has been removed are at riskof contamination from immersion in water. This contamination occurs when the perfo-rated rubber stopper (septum) comes in contact with melted ice. Health workers have found that when they put opened vials in resealable plastic bags (e.g., Ziploc \u00aebags) and close them securely before putting the vials back in a cold box, the vial septum stays dry and uncontaminated. An added benefit is that the vac-cine label does not come loose and become separated from the vial as it does whenvials are soaked in water. Clearly, technology does not have to be \"high-tech,\" high-cost, or new. But even simple technologies should be thoroughly field-tested before they are recommended for wide-spread use.203Immunization Essentials Chapter 11: New Vaccines and TechnologiesReferences Chin, James. 2000.

In 1989, WHO recommended that yellow fever vaccine be used inendemic countries. In the 1990s, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines were recommended where the disease burden was known or sus-pected to be high and control of the diseases was a public health priority. This chapter describes the following vaccine-preventable diseases and the vac- cines in use to prevent them: Diphtheria Hib Disease Hepatitis B Measles Pertussis (whooping cough) Polio Tetanus Tuberculosis Yellow fever Vitamin A deficiency (VAD), which is being addressed as part of national immunization programs in many developing countries, is then discussed.

The infection can involve almost any mucousmembrane, but the most common sites ofinfection are the tonsils and pharynx. Thistype of diphtheria can lead to obstructedbreathing and death. In tropical coun-tries, the disease usually affects the skin(cutaneous diphtheria) and may result inhigh levels of natural immunity against respiratory diphtheria. Identification - In its tonsillar and pharyngeal form, diphtheria infection results in the formation of a bluish-white membrane that can cover the back ofthe throat, as seen in the photograph above. The membrane causes gaggingand difficulty in swallowing and breathing. Transmission - The type of diphtheria that affects the throat and respiratory tract is spread in droplets and secretions from the nose, throat, and eyes ofan infected person. Skin diphtheria is spread through direct contact withdiphtheria ulcers or through clothing and other articles that have beencontaminated with fluid from the ulcers. Diphtheria can also be transmittedthrough unpasteurized milk products. Population at Risk - The epidemiology of diphtheria has changed consid- erably over recent decades due to improvements in sanitary conditions andimmunization coverage. In developing countries, the disease is occurring lessfrequently in very young children, and more outbreaks are being seen amongschoolchildren, adolescents, and adults. Estimated Morbidity and Mortality - In 1999, according to WHO, approximately 5,000 cases of diphtheria were reported worldwide. Between5% and 10% of patients die, even with treatment. WHO-Recommended Case Definition: Diphtheria Clinical description: An illness characterized by laryngitis or pharyngitis or tonsillitis and the presence of an adherent membrane of the tonsils, pharynx, and/or nose. Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: Isolation of Corynebacterium diphtheriae from a clini- cal specimen, or fourfold or greater rise in serum antibody (but only if both serum sam-ples were obtained before the administration of diphtheria toxoid or antitoxin). Source: WHO, 1998 Credit: WHO A grayish membrane on the pharanx isa well-known sign of diphtheria.211Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesOccurrence - Diphtheria occurs worldwide among unimmunized populations and, in industrialized countries, among populations whose immunity haswaned, largely because of the lack of routine booster immunizations for adults.As shown in the chart, diphtheria can be reduced to a very low level but thenmay reemerge in serious outbreaks in both temperate and tropical climates. The largest epidemic since diphtheria vaccine was introduced in national immunization programs occurred from 1990 to 1998 in countries of theformer Soviet Union, with over 50,000 cases and 1,500 deaths reported inthe peak year of 1995. Among the epidemic's causes were the build-up ofsusceptible children and adults due to low coverage with diphtheria toxoidand large migrations of unprotected people. The response \u2014which included vaccination of all children, diphtheria boosters for older children and adults,and treatment of cases and contacts \u2014was initially slow because of vaccine and drug shortages, inadequate cold chains, and other operational problems.Coverage eventually improved significantly and incidence has dropped. Treatment - Diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotics (erythromycin or penicillin) are prescribed for suspected diphtheria. Cases are isolated and contacts arevaccinated with diphtheria toxoid to prevent additional cases. People in closecontact with diphtheria patients should also be given antibiotics. Diphtheria Toxoid The most effective way to control diphtheria is to prevent it through immuniza-tion of children in their first year of life with three doses of diphtheria toxoid,in the trivalent presentation of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP).Diphtheria toxoid can also be used to immunize adults during outbreaks. Form and Presentation - Diphtheria toxoid is a liquid vaccine that doesSource: WHO, 2000Reported global incidence of Diphtheria, 1980 - 1999212Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable Diseasesnot need reconstitution. It is available in a variety of forms, including the three listed below. Diphtheria toxoid is also available with tetanus toxoid and pertussis vaccine in combinations with hepatitis B and Hib vaccines. Efficacy - Three doses of diphtheria-containing vaccine provide over 95% protection against diphtheria for at least 10 years. Side Effects - Mild fever and crying are common reactions to DTP. Many infants also have a mild local reaction with redness and swelling. Severe systemic reactions (e.g., seizures, neurologic complications, and ana- phylaxis) may follow DTP vaccinations, but these occur only rarely. Contraindications - There are no contraindications to DTP except that it should not be given to children who have suffered a severe reaction to a pre-vious dose. Schedule and Target Age Group - For the primary series, WHO recom- mends that infants be given three doses of DTP, one dose each at six, 10, and14 weeks of age. If children do not get a second or third dose of DTP on time, they should not be given another first dose: they should continue with the remaining doses only. Administration of DTP Vaccine - A 0.5 ml DTP dose is injected intramus- cularly, usually into the outer part of the thigh. If more than one injection isgiven at the same time, different injection sites should be used for each. Booster Doses after a Child's First Year - For longer-lasting protection, countries that have reached high coverage with the primary series of threeDTP doses may give one or two booster doses after children reach one yearPresentations of Diphtheria Toxoid Presentation Ingredients Primary age group DTPDiphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis vaccineChildren through six years ofage toxoid Children through six years ofage TdTetanus toxoid with reduced diphtheria content Children seven years of ageand older; adults213Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable Diseasesof age. When one booster is given, it is administered in the second year of life. When two are given, one injection is given in the second year, and thesecond is given at four or five years of age. Due to the increased risk of adverse reactions to the pertussis component in older children, DTP should not be given to children after they reach the age ofseven years. These children should be given DT or Td. Outbreak Control Strategies - During diphtheria epidemics, the largest possible proportion of the population group involved should be vaccinated,with priority given to infants and preschool children. Those who have beenpreviously immunized should receive booster doses; unimmunized infants andchildren should receive the primary series of three doses. Patients and closecontacts should be given antibiotics.DTP Immunization Schedule for Children under One Year of Age Age Minimum Interval between Doses Dose 6 weeks DTP1 10 weeks 4 weeks DTP2 14 weeks 4 weeks DTP3214Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesReferences Public Health Foundation. 2001.

In addition to bacterial meningitis and pneumonia, manifestations of Hib disease include septicarthritis, osteomyelitis, septicaemia, and epiglottitis. Identification - Diagnosis of Hib pneumonia is difficult, so efforts to identify Hib cases focus on bacterial meningitis, as defined in the box below. Transmission - Hib bacteria are passed to other children in droplets of saliva expelled when an infected child coughs or sneezes. Hib also spreadswhen children share toys and other things that they put in their mouths. Therisk of transmission increases when children spend long periods of time incrowded households, day care settings, or cr\u00e8ches. Population at Risk - Children under one year of age are at the highest risk for Hib disease. The disease is rare in children older than five years. Estimated Morbidity and Mortality - Population-based data on Hib incidence are limited, but WHO estimates that Hib causes approximatelythree million cases of serious disease and approximately 450,000 deathseach year. Approximately 20% of meningitis survivors have long-termneurological Case Definition: Bacterial Meningitis Clinical description: Bacterial meningitis is characterized by acute onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck. Meningitis is not specific for Hib disease, and Hib disease cannot be diagnosed on clinical grounds. Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: Culture method: Isolation of Hib from a normally sterile clinical specimen, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood. Culture of Hib from a non-sterile site, such as the throat, does not define Hib disease since the bacteria can grow in these other areasand not cause disease. Antigen detection methods: Identification of Hib antigen in normally sterile fluids (i.e., CSF or blood) by antigen detection methods such as latex agglutination of counter immunoelectrophoresis. Source: WHO, 1998b216Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesThe WHO has recently devised a methodology for rapidly estimating the incidence of Hib disease. This rapid assessment tool, which requires about tendays of field work, uses detailed local data on bacterial meningitis to gener-ate estimates of overall Hib burden. See Estimating the Local Burden of Hib Diseases Preventable by Vaccination (WHO, 2001). Occurrence - There appears to be geographic variation in the occurrence of disease caused by Hib. While data from Africa and Latin America haveclearly indicated its importance as a cause of pneumonia, meningitis, andother childhood diseases, studies in Asia have yielded lower-than-expectedestimates of the burden of Hib disease. Ongoing research will help establishthe magnitude and patterns of disease from Hib in Asian countries. Treatment - Antibiotics are used for treatment. Bacterial resistance is now being seen with some antibiotics. Hib Vaccine Hib vaccination of children in the first six months of life is the most effectivemeans of controlling invasive Hib disease, but this will only protect them fromdiseases caused by type b Haemophilus influenzae . Hib vaccine will not pre- vent meningitis and pneumonia caused by other types of Haemophilus influen- zaeor other agents. As of early 2001, 71 countries had included Hib vaccine in their routine immunization schedule. Countries with Hib vaccine coverage rates above80% for young children have documented a 99% decline in the incidence ofinvasive Hib disease, including Hib meningitis. Form and Presentation - Hib vaccines are available in monovalent and multivalent forms. Its formulations include liquid and freeze-dried (orlyophilized) vaccines, as described in the box on the following page.Changing from one formulation of Hib vaccine to another before a child hascompleted the primary Hib series causes no harm.Special Aspects of Hib Surveillance Since Hib diagnosis requires a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid for labo-ratory confirmation, nationwide surveillance may not be practical in many countries. Insuch countries, disease burden and the impact of Hib immunization programs can bemeasured by combining Hib coverage data from all facilities that provide Hib vaccina-tions with disease data from sentinel surveillance sites that have the necessary clinicaland laboratory capacity. Source: WHO, 1998b 217Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesEfficacy - Three doses of Hib vaccine are more than 95% effective in pre- venting invasive Hib disease. Side Effects - Hib vaccine has not been associated with any serious side effects, although there may be redness, swelling, and soreness at the injectionsite. Contraindications - There are no contraindications to Hib vaccine. Schedule and Target Age Group - Hib immunization schedules for chil- dren under one year of age differ from country to country, depending on theform of Hib vaccine and the schedule for other vaccines. In general, it is givenat the same time as DTP, as shown in the commonly used schedule below. Administration - A 0.5 ml of a dose of Hib vaccine is injected intramuscu- larly, usually into the outer part of the thigh. If more than one injection is givenat the same time, different injection sites should be used for each. Booster Doses after a Child's First Year - Booster doses of Hib vaccine are not recommended in developing countries. Choices among Hib Vaccines Choices among Hib vaccines are likely to change; it is always advisable to checkavailability with UNICEF or other vaccine suppliers. Liquid monovalent Hib: No reconstitution is required. Monovalent Hib vaccine adds another injection to the number a child receives. Lyophilized monovalent: This vaccine needs to be reconstituted, which increases operational complexity and the risk of contamination. As a monovalent vaccine, it requires an additional injection. Storage space is needed for the vaccine and its dilu-ent (although diluent does not need refrigeration until The combina- tion reduces the number of injections needed from nine to three. DTP+Hib - Freeze-dried Hib vaccine is reconstituted with DTP.

WHO/VRD/95.05.219Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesHepatitis B Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver. If not fatal, acute infection either resolves or progresses to chronic infection, which may lead to cirrhosis orliver cancer several decades later. When it resolves, patients developlifelong immunity. In developing countries, hepatitis B infection usually occurs in childhood \u2014 at the time of birth, during infancy, or in early childhood. Symptoms are not usu-ally apparent in infected young people, but the likelihood that an infectedchild will develop lifelong chronic infection is higher than if the infectionoccurs in older children or adults. IdentificationAcute infection - The clinical description of acute hepatitis B is indistin- guishable from that of other types of acute viral hepatitis (A through E). Notethat the clinical description below is the same for all acute viral hepatitis infec-tions, and that laboratory testing is necessary for diagnosis. Chronic infection - People with chronic infection are often asymptomatic for decades after infection, but during this time they can transmit the virus toothers and are at high risk of eventually developing liver disease themselves.The risk of death from cirrhosis and primary liver cancer is approximately25% for persons who become chronically infected during early childhood and15% for persons who become chronically infected at an older age. WHO-Recommended Case Definition: Acute Viral Hepatitis Diseases Clinical description of acute viral hepatitis disease: An acute illness typi- cally including acute jaundice, dark urine, anorexia, malaise, extreme fatigue, andright upper quadrant tenderness. (None of these symptoms is common in infants andyoung children.) Biologic signs include increased urine urobilonogen and >2.5 timesthe upper limit of serum alanine aminotransferase. criteria diagnosis: Hepatitis A: positive for IgM anti-HAV Hepatitis B: positive for IgM anti-HBc-positive or, less preferably, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Non-A, non-B: negative for IgM anti-HAV and IgM anti-HBc or HBsAg Hepatitis C: positive for anti-HCV Hepatitis D (occurs only as co-infection or super-infection of hepatitis B): positive for IgM anti-HBc or, less preferably, HBsAg plus anti-HDV positive Hepatitis E: positive for IgM anti-HEV WHO, 1998220Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesTransmission - In developing countries, the hepatitis B virus is most com- monly transmitted to children by: Child-to-child transmission through open wounds or shared implements that contain blood or body fluids. This accounts for the majority of hepati-tis B infections worldwide. Exposure of babies to maternal blood or other fluids during delivery, if the mother is a chronic carrier. Use of contaminated needles and syringes for vaccinations, injections, and transfusions. In countries where infection occurs later in life, the disease is transmitted through sexual activity, contaminated needles and syringes, and contaminatedblood products. Population at Risk - Hepatitis B virus infection can occur at any age. In Asia and Africa, infection often occurs in infancy and childhood, when infect-ed individuals are more likely to become chronically infected. Estimated Morbidity and Mortality - More than two billion individuals alive today have been infected at some time in their lives with the hepatitis Bvirus. Approximately 350 million of these are chronic carriers. Over 500,000people die every year from cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. Occurrence - Hepatitis B is endemic worldwide. Age-dependent risk of becoming a carrier Source: International Conference on the Control of Hepatitis B in the Developing World, 1991221Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesTreatment - The drugs interferon or lamivudine are used to treat chronic hep- atitis B, but they are only moderately effective, cost thousands of dollars perpatient, and are not realistic options for most people in developing countries. Hepatitis B Vaccine WHO recommends that hepatitis B vaccine be offered to all children underone year of age in all countries. More than 130 developing countries nowroutinely provide the vaccine, and more are preparing to do so with the sup-port of GAVI and the Vaccine Fund. Form and Presentation - Hepatitis B vaccine is available in liquid form, in monovalent and combination formulations, as shown below. Hepatitis B vaccines are available in single-dose and multi-dose glass vials. Multi-dose vials contain two, six, 10, or 20 doses. Efficacy - Hep B is one of the safest and most effective of vaccines. Studies have shown that it is 95% effective in preventing chronic infection. For infantsexposed by the mother at birth, monovalent Hep B vaccine is 90% effective inpreventing transmission if the first dose is administered within 24 hours andthe series completed at the recommended intervals. Side Effects - Mild, temporary local reactions are common after an injection of Hep B vaccine. It is highly unusual to see an anaphylactic reaction. Contraindications - There are no contraindications to this vaccine, except if a very rare anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose has occurred, thenHep B should not be given again.Formulations of Hep B Vaccines Monovalent: This is the only Hep B vaccine that can be used at birth. May be used for later doses. Combination vaccines: Must not be used until a child is at least six weeks of age. Combination vaccines now available include: DTP-Hep B (liquid) DTP-Hep B+Hib (Comes in two vials: liquid DTP and Hep B in one vial and freeze- dried Hib in the other. Mixing is required.) Do Not Freeze Hep B Vaccine! Freezing Hep B vaccine reduces its efficacy, and the vaccine freezes at -0.5\u00b0C, sever- al degrees warmer than the freezing point of DTP. Since accidental freezing of DTP iscommon, freezing of hepatitis B vaccine is likely to be a problem as well. 222Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesSchedule and Target Age Group - Hep B is usually given as a three- dose series, with each dose at least four weeks apart. Scheduling optionsinclude a longer interval between the second and third dose and a four-doseschedule when a birth dose is given. In countries where perinatal transmission is a significant problem, the first dose should be given at birth. Only monovalent Hep B vaccine can be givensafely at this time, but later doses may be given in combination with othervaccines. Scheduling options recommended by WHO are shown below. When countries introduce Hep B into their routine immunization schedules, managers must decide whether to use a gradual strategy, in which only chil-dren born after the date of introduction are immunized, or a catch-up strategy,in which children born before the date of introduction are also immunized(see Chapter 11). Administration - A 0.5 ml dose of Hep B vaccine injected intramuscularly, usually into the outer part of the thigh. If more than one vaccine is injected atthe same time, different injection sites should be used for each injection. Booster Doses - Booster doses are not recommended.Options for Scheduling Hep B for Children under One Year of Age AgeI Countries with low perinataltransmissionII Countries with high perinatal Hep dose; DTPIII Countries with high perinatal transmission Monovalent Hep B for all three doses Provides longer interval between Hep B2 and Hep B3 Birth Hep B1 Hep B1 6 weeks Hep B2 Hep B2 B3 Hepatitis B Vaccination of Health Workers Hepatitis B vaccination is usually not recommended for health workers in developing countries because it is likely that they have been exposed to the virus during child-hood. Also, they are less likely to become carriers if they become infected as adults.223Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesReferences International Conference on the Control of Hepatitis B in the Developing World: Towards the Elimination of Hepatitis B .

Over one-half of thesedeaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Identification - Measles is an acute viral infection characterized by a vari- ety of symptoms, including fever, rash, cough, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, earinfections, pneumonia, and brain inflammation. Transmission - Measles is extremely infectious. The virus is transmitted through the air by respiratory droplets expelled by infected individuals. Susceptible individuals in close contact with infected people are most likely to become infected, so transmission is more easily maintained in crowded homes,urban slum areas, and congested places than in isolated or rural situations. WHO-Recommended Case Definition: Measles Clinical case definition: Any person in whom a clinician suspects measles infec- tion or any person with fever and maculopapular rash (i.e., non-vesicular or withoutfluid) and cough, coryza (i.e., runny nose), or conjunctivitis (i.e., red eyes). Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: At least a fourfold increase in antibody titer, or isolation of measles virus, or presence of measles-specific IgM antibodies. Source: WHO, 1998 Ease of Measles Transmission One study found that two-thirds of the children coming to a clinic in West Africa withmeasles probably caught the measles at the clinic on earlier visits one to three weeksbefore. Source: Klein-Zabban et al., 1987 Credit: Daniel Cima, American CrossCredit: Daniel Cima, American Red Cross225Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesPopulation at Risk - A person is susceptible to measles when he or she has lost maternal antibodies, has never been infected, or has not been effec-tively vaccinated. Maternal antibodies provide immunity to infants against measles infection until they are at least six months of age. After that, immunity begins to wane. Infection provides lifelong immunity.Vaccination provides immunity if vaccine is given at an age when the child's maternal antibodies have been lost and the child can seroconvert for protec-tion. In developing countries, the best age for most children is nine months. In both urban and rural areas in developing countries, the majority of measles cases occur in children less than five years of age, as illustrated bydata from Nigeria. In this study, case fatality rates were estimated at 8% for children under one year of age, 4% for children ages two to four, and 2% for children five andolder. Widespread malnutrition in the outbreak area was believed to havecontributed to the mortality rate, which eventually exceeded 15,000. Population density affects the age of infection. Among rural populations, the age of infection is usually older than in densely settled urban populations. Incountries with low measles vaccination coverage, most measles deaths occuramong unvaccinated children who are younger than five years old. However,as high measles coverage is achieved and sustained over a period of fiveyears or longer, measles outbreaks affect older children and young adults, ashas occurred in the Western Hemisphere.Source: Foster, 2001226Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesEstimated Morbidity and Mortality - Measles deaths occur as a result of complications, including pneumonia, acute diarrhea and dehydration,chronic diarrhea with malnutrition, and rarely, encephalitis. The disease canalso cause serious disability, including permanent blindness, deafness, andbrain damage. Infection with measles depresses the immune system, depletes the body's stores of vitamin A, leads to weight loss, and leaves children susceptible todiseases like pneumonia and diarrhea. Because the health system receivesreports of complications rather than measles disease itself, measles cases anddeaths are often underestimated. Occurrence - Measles is generally a seasonal disease. In temperate climates, transmission peaks in late winter and early spring. In the tropics, itincreases in the dry season. In large, crowded cities with low measles vaccinecoverage, transmission can be continuous throughout the year. In these areas,measles is a particularly important problem because infection can occurbefore children are old enough to be effectively vaccinated. The frequency of measles outbreaks depends on the density of people susceptible to the disease and the probability of exposure to infectious cases.In countries with low coverage, epidemics occur every two to three years. Incountries with high coverage, epidemics occur at five- to seven-year intervals. Treatment - Supportive care includes frequent food and fluid intake and treatment of complications. Vitamin A supplementation reduces the number ofdeaths from measles. Measles Vaccine Measles vaccination is one of the most effective preventive measuresavailable. Maintaining coverage above 90% can have a major impacton public health. Form and Presentation - Most national programs, except in the Americas, use monovalent measles vaccine, which is in freeze-dried formand must be reconstituted with measles diluent from the same manufacturer.Vitamin A in Measles Case Management Measles seriously depletes vitamin A in children, making them more susceptible to complications. For example, until recently, half of the blindness in children in one EastAfrican country resulted from corneal scarring following measles infection. Vitamin Asupplementation for these children would have prevented this outcome. 227Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesReconstituted measles vaccine is highly sensitive to heat and should be discarded at the end of a session or six hours after reconstitution, whichevercomes first. Measles vaccine is also available in combination with rubella vaccine as MR and in combination with mumps and rubella vaccines as MMR. Efficacy - Up to 15% of children who are vaccinated before their first birth- day do not seroconvert (develop sufficient antibodies) and so are not protect-ed against measles. In areas where vaccination coverage with one dose ofmeasles is high, this failure to seroconvert accounts for a large proportion ofthe remaining susceptible children. In these high coverage areas, a secondopportunity may be advisable to protect children who did not seroconvert thefirst time. In areas with low measles vaccination coverage, however, failure tovaccinate with the first dose rather than failure to seroconvert is by far themore significant problem (see pages 228-229). Side Effects - Approximately 10% of children develop a low fever after a measles vaccination, and 5% develop a generalized, non-infectious rash. Contraindications - There are no contraindications to measles vaccination. Measles vaccine should be given to eligible children at the first opportunity,even if the child is sick or malnourished. In fact, because malnourishedchildren are at great risk of dying from measles, their vaccination should begiven priority. In the absence of documented proof of measles vaccination, such as a vacci- nation card, measles vaccine should be given even if parents believe that theirchild has already been infected. Because children with HIV are at higher risk of severe measles disease and measles vaccine can safely be given to HIV-infected children, measlesvaccination is recommended for all children regardless of their HIV status. Measles Vaccination in the Presence of HIV Measles can be very severe in HIV-infected children. WHO currently recommends that an early dose be given at six months, followed by the scheduled dose at nine months to children who are known to be infected with HIV.For children who are symptomatic for AIDS, the potential risks and benefits must beevaluated on an individual basis. The overall risk of adverse events from the vaccine isrelatively low compared with the risk of measles infection in HIV-infected children. Children should not be screened for HIV antibody status before receiving measles vaccine.228Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesFirst Opportunity for Measles Vaccination The relative importance of the first and second opportunities to vaccinate is illustrated below using two hypothetical districts with the same population size. District A is lowperforming with only 50% measles coverage. District B is high performing with 90%.After the first opportunity, District A has many more unprotected children (5750) thanDistrict B (2350). In District A, 87% of the unprotected children are unprotected because of failure to vaccinate, and 13% remain unprotected because of a failure to seroconvert. In DistrictB, the majority of the unprotected children (57% ) are due to a failure to seroconvert. In the same two hypothetical districts, health officials decide to offer a second opportu- nity for measles vaccination through mass campaigns. Coverage of 90% is achievedin both districts. The vaccine efficacy is 95% because older children are targeted. Asseen in the next table, the number of unprotected children in District A drops from5750 to 834 and in District B from 2350 to 341. District A (low-performing)District B(high-performing) Total number of children 10,000 10,000 Vaccinated with 1 dose 5000 (cov=50%) 9000 (cov=90%) - of whom protected (85% efficacy) 4250 7650 - of whom unprotected 750 (=9000-7650) TOVACCINATE87% (=5000/5750) 43% (=1000/2350) - of SERO-CONVERT13% (=750/5750) 57% (=1350/2350) *Assuming all unprotected children Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesSecond Opportunity for Measles Vaccination District A District B 10,000 Total number of children 10,000 4250 Protected after first opportunity 7650 5750 Unprotected after first opportunity 2350 5000 (no previ- ous dose)750 (one dose, unprotected)Reasons for lack of protection afterfirst opportunity1000 (no previous dose)1350 (one dose, unprotected) 4500 (1st dose)675 (2nd dose)Vaccinated after second opportunity(90%) 900 (5%)45 61 500 75Unprotected due to failure tovaccinate100 135 725 + 109 = 834 Total unprotected* 145 + 196 = 341 * Assuming all unprotected children eventually contract measles. The success of the hypothetical campaign shown above depended on reaching a high per- centage (90%) of children who were missed by routine services. The great majority ofthese children are now protected from measles infection, as shown below. Protection against Measles Due to First and Second Doses District A (low-performing) 1st opportunity 2nd opportunity Total 1st dose (12%) 9659 (100%) This example shows that, as in the real world, most children are protected by the first doseof measles vaccine that they receive, whether they receive it as a part of routine immuniza-tion services or during a campaign. It also shows that protection due to a second dose isrelatively small (7% in District A and 12% in District B). Therefore, failure to deliver thatfirst dose to all infants remains the primary reason for high measles morbidity.230Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesSchedule and Target Age Group - Vaccination with measles vaccine is not usually effective before a child reaches nine months of age. In developingcountries, measles vaccine should be given at nine months of age or as soonas possible thereafter. The age of vaccination may be altered in response to epidemiological and other data. For example, in refugee situations, measles vaccine is often recom-mended at six months and again at 12 months. Administration - The 0.5 ml dose of measles vaccine is injected subcuta- neously into the upper left arm. Booster Doses - Booster doses are not given. Control Strategies - In 2001, WHO and UNICEF proposed a global strat- egy for measles mortality reduction that combines routine and supplementalimmunization. As shown in the graph on page 231, a combination ofapproaches is needed to achieve and sustain reduction in measles deaths.The rapid reduction in mortality through supplemental immunization targetinga wide age range will last for only a few years unless routine immunization isalso strengthened. Strengthened routine immunization, resulting in a modestincrease in coverage of 5% each year, will lead to long-term sustained mortal-ity reduction; because this will take many years to achieve in some countries,it is essential that a start be made now. Comprehensive plans for measles mor-tality reduction should include clear objectives and activities for strengtheningroutine immunization with provision of budgetary and technical support.Sustained and optimal reduction in measles mortality will only occur whenboth supplemental immunization and strengthened routine immunization areimplemented in combination, followed by less frequent follow-up campaignstargeting a narrower age range. The essential elements of a comprehensive control strategy include: Provide a first dose of measles vaccine to all infants. Guarantee a \"second opportunity\" for measles vaccination. Establish an effective system to monitor coverage and conduct measles surveillance. Improve the management of complicated measles cases, including vitamin A supplementation.The Measles Challenge In developing countries, vaccinations against measles are usually given at nine months of age, which is nearly six months after the other vaccines in the schedule have beengiven. The time gap means that even when coverage for OPV and DTP is high, cover-age with measles may be low. 231Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesMeasles mortality reduction - Countries with less than 80% measles coverage should focus on improving and expanding routine immunizationservices. These countries may sometimes use campaigns to reach childrenwho do not have access to routine immunization services. All children in thetarget age group for these campaigns, usually from nine months of age to lessthan five years, should be eligible for vaccination, irrespective of past measlesillness or vaccination history. For some children, such campaigns provide a\"second opportunity\" to become immunized. Note that the upper age rangemay be expanded depending on the local epidemiology. The primary objective of mortality reduction campaigns should be to reach previously unimmunized children. Measles elimination - Some countries that have achieved and maintained measles vaccination coverage above 80% across all districts for at least threeyears conduct periodic campaigns to supplement routine services in order toeliminate the disease.Projected impact of different measles vaccination strategies on measles dealths in Africa 2001-2025 Source: Foster, S., 2001, adapted from N. GayRoutine coverage (%)Duration of Impact in Years at Different Levels of Routine and Campaign Coverage Campaign Coverage 20% 40% 60% 80% 20 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 50 0.4 0.8 1 1.6 80 1 2 3 4 90 2 4 6 9Source: WHO, 2003232Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesFirst, a \"catch-up\" campaign is carried out to interrupt chains of transmission in all children from the age of nine months through an upper age that is consistentwith local epidemiology. Thereafter, \"follow-up\" campaigns are used periodi-cally to reach those who have not been reached at all and to ensure thatchildren who have been vaccinated but are still unprotected will seroconvert. To maintain elimination, high coverage must continue with a combination of routine services and with periodic campaigns to prevent the build-up ofsusceptibles. Outbreak response - Measles importation should be expected even in areas that have eliminated the disease, and when outbreaks occur, control canbe difficult because many susceptible people can be infected before a vaccina-tion campaign can be organized. Health services can still respond effectively,however, by treating complications, administering vitamin A supplementation,and investigating cases to determine how to prevent recurrences. Routine measles vaccination coverage, supplemented by campaigns, should be the focus of management efforts to prevent outbreaks from occurring at all.233Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesReferences Brown, Phyllida.

WHO/EPI/GEN/93.17.234Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesPertussis Pertussis, also called whooping cough, is a highly contagious, acute bacterialdisease affecting the respiratory tract.Worldwide, it causes an estimated300,000 deaths per year. Identification - Patients with pertus- sis have long-lasting coughs. Infantsare more likely to choke than whoop,and those less than three months oldmay stop breathing altogether.Together, pertussis and measlesaccount for up to one-quarter of deathsdue to acute respiratory infections. Transmission - Pertussis is spread in droplets from the nose and throat that are expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The diseasespreads easily among susceptible people who live in crowded conditions. Population at Risk - Newborns receive minimal antibody protection from their mothers, and it quickly wanes. Approximately one-third of all cases occurin infants under six months old, and half of all deaths are in children underone year. Estimated Morbidity and Mortality - 80% or more of unprotected chil- dren get pertussis, and 1% of those who get the disease die. Pertussis canlead to frailty and wasting. WHO-Recommended Case Definition: Pertussis Clinical description: A person with a cough lasting at least two weeks with at least one of the following: Fits of coughing Intake of breath accompanied by a whooping sound Vomiting immediately after coughing and without any other apparent cause Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: Isolation of Bordetella pertussis or detection of genomic sequences by polymerase chain reaction. Source: WHO, 1998 Credit: WHO235Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesOccurrence - Pertussis occurs in both urban and rural areas. In urban areas, infants are more commonly affected; in rural areas, most cases occur in olderchildren and are milder. The majority of pertussis cases occur in developingcountries; in industrialized countries incidence is high among unimmunizedinfants, and outbreaks occur among adolescents and young adults. Treatment - Antibiotics may be given to shorten the period of communicabil- ity (approximately three weeks), but they do not cure the disease or evenreduce symptoms unless they are given during the incubation period or soonafter symptoms appear. Pertussis Vaccine The most effective strategy for preventing pertussis requires the timely deliveryof three doses of vaccine at the proper intervals during a child's first year oflife. Pertussis vaccine also helps to reduce mortality from pneumonia, otheracute respiratory infections, and malnutrition. Form and Presentation - Two types of pertussis vaccine are available: whole-cell and acellular. Whole-cell vaccine, which has been in use in national immunization programs in developing countries for several decades, has had a significant impact onpertussis incidence. Concern about very rare adverse events following whole-cell pertussis vaccina- tion led to the development of acellular pertussis vaccine. Acellular vaccinescompare favorably with whole-cell vaccines in terms of efficacy and sideeffects, but they are more expensive. DTP with whole-cell pertussis costsapproximately US$0.07 per dose compared US$10.00 perdose of DTP with acellular pertussis. Acellular pertussis vaccine is now licensed in many industrialized countries, but in developing countries only whole-cell pertussis vaccine is used in nation-al immunization programs. Efficacy - Efficacy is estimated to be approximately 80% after three doses. Side Effects - Mild fever and crying are common reactions to DTP. Many infants also have a mild local reaction with redness and swelling. Rarely, severe systemic reactions, such as seizures, neurological complica- tions, and anaphylaxis, follow DTP vaccination. Severe crying for three ormore hours or high fever over 105\u00b0F may occur with pertussis vaccine. 236Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesContraindications - There are no contraindications to DTP except that it should not be given to children who have suffered a severe reaction to aprevious dose. Schedule and Target Age Group - WHO recommends that three doses of pertussis vaccine in the DTP formulation be given to infants at six, 10, and14 weeks of age. If a child does not get the second dose of DTP at the scheduled time, he or she does not need to restart the series. The second dose should be givenat the earliest opportunity, and the third dose should be given after a four-week interval. Administration of DTP Vaccine - The 0.5 ml dose of DTP is injected intramuscularly, usually into the outer part of the thigh. Booster Doses after a Child's First Year - For longer-lasting protection, countries that have reached high coverage with the primary series of three DTPdoses may give one or two booster doses after children reach one year of ageup to the age of seven. Thereafter, children should not be given pertussis vac-cine, even in combination, due to the increased risk of adverse reactions.DTP Immunization Schedule for Children under One Year of Age Age Minimum Interval Between Doses Dose 6 weeks DTP1 10 weeks 4 weeks DTP2 14 weeks 4 weeks DTP3237Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesReferences M.

WHO/EPI/GEN/93.14.238Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesPolio In 1988, the World Health Assembly set a goal to eradicate poliomyelitis(polio), worldwide. Since then,national governments, WHO,UNICEF, Rotary International, CDC,USAID, and other bilateral agencieshave been working to achieve thegoal of polio eradication. Identification - Polio is a disease of the central nervous system causedby three closely related polioviruses:types 1, 2, and 3. Approximately5% of people exposed to any ofthese viruses have influenza-likesymptoms such as fever, loose stools,sore throat, headache, or upsetstomach. Some may have pain orstiffness in the neck, back, and legs,and 1% become paralyzed. In paralytic polio, severe muscle pains follow the milder symptoms, and then paralysis develops, usually in the first week of illness. The use of one or bothlegs or arms may be lost, and breathing without a respirator may becomeimpossible. People with these severe symptoms can, but do not always,recover. Prior to the eradication initiative, polio was the leading cause oflameness worldwide. Transmission - Poliovirus is highly communicable. It is spread from person to person by contact with infected feces or secretions from the nose andmouth. People who do not have symptoms may spread the disease. Population at Risk - Every person who is not vaccinated against polio will acquire the infection if the virus is in the environment, with the followingoutcomes: WHO-Recommended Case Definition: Poliomyelitis Clinical case definition: Any child under fifteen years of age with acute flaccid paraly- sis (AFP) or any person with paralytic illness at any age when polio is suspected. Source: WHO, 1998 Credit: WHO239Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable Diseases 95% will show no effect. 4% will have a mild flu-like illness. 1% will become paralyzed or lame. 0.5% will be lame for life. 0.1% will die during the acute phase. Estimated Morbidity and Mortality - As a result of the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI), there has been a 99% decrease in the number of confirmedpolio cases compared with the 350,000 cases reported in 1988. Occurrence - Polio can occur anywhere in the world. In regions where it has been eliminated, such as the Americas, Europe, and the Western Pacific,control measures and certification-quality surveillance must be sustained untilthe disease is eradicated worldwide. Treatment - There is no specific treatment for polio. However, physical ther- apy can limit deformity and increase the likelihood that a patient can use andbenefit from braces. Polio Vaccine Immunization is the only protection against polio infection. Form and Presentation - Most immunization programs in developing countries use oral polio vaccine (OPV). OPV, unlike other vaccines, is givenorally and therefore, can be given by people with limited training. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is an injectable vaccine and is relatively expensive. IPV appears to produce less immunity in the intestines than OPV, sopersons who receive IPV are more readily infected with wild polio virus thanOPV recipients. Such infected persons are protected from paralytic polio, butCirculating Vaccine-Derived Polio Virus (cVDPV): A Newly Emerging Threat Under very rare circumstances that are not fully understood, the virus strains in oral polio vaccine (OPV) can regain two important properties of wild polio virus: the abili-ties to cause paralytic disease in humans and to spread from person to person. Thisphenomenon, known as circulating vaccine-derived polio virus, has been documentedin Egypt, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, and Madagascar. In eachcase, vaccination coverage was very low in the affected areas. As with wild poliovirus, the critical factor in controlling cVDPV is achieving and maintaining high vacci-nation coverage rates through a combination of strengthening the routine immunizationsystem and supplemental vaccination. 240Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable Diseasesthe wild virus being shed in their stool could result in transmission to other persons. Children vaccinated with IPV, as opposed to OPV, cannot spreadtheir vaccine-derived immunity to contacts through fecal-oral contamination. Efficacy - In more than 95% of recipients, three doses of OPV produce immunity for all three of the poliovirus types in the vaccine. Side Effects - Reactions to OPV are rare. Vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) is a rare adverse event that occurs following the administration of OPV.It is estimated that there is one case of VAPP per 2.4 million doses given toboth healthy and immunodeficient individuals. Contraindications - There are no contraindications to polio vaccination. However, if a child has diarrhea when OPV is given, an extra dose should beadministered four weeks later. Routine Schedule and Target Age Group - WHO recommends that children receive four doses of OPV before one year of age as part of the rou-tine immunization program. These doses should be given at least four weeksapart, usually at the same time as DTP, as shown in the table below. If theOPV0 dose is not given within 14 days of birth, it should not be given at all,and the primary series should begin with OPV1 at six weeks of age. Administration of OPV - OPV is dropped into the mouth. Usually two drops are given, but this may differ by vaccine manufacturer. Eradication Strategies - A combination of strategies is being used for polio eradication. These strategies must ensure that immunity remains highand susceptibility low everywhere until there is global agreement to stopvaccinating against polio. Routine immunization. National immunization programs in all countries should immunize at least 90% of infants by one year of age with four doses of OPVthrough routine immunization services. OPV Immunization Schedule for Children under One Year of Age Age Minimum Interval Between Doses Dose Within 14 days of birth OPV0 6 weeks 4 weeks OPV1 10 weeks 4 weeks OPV2 14 weeks 4 weeks OPV3241Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesSupplemental immunization through national immunization days. To interrupt wild poliovirus circulation in endemic countries, routine polio vaccinationsshould be supplemented by national immunization days (NIDs). During NIDs,all children less than five years of age should receive OPV, regardless of theirimmunization status. In most countries that have been able to interrupt transmission, two rounds of NIDs each year, spaced four weeks apart, were repeated for three consecu-tive years. In countries with continuing transmission, low routine OPV immu-nization, and high population density, as many as five rounds of NIDs havebeen required. Sometimes, door-to-door vaccination has been used to try toreach all children. Sub-national immunization days (SNIDs) and local immunization days (LIDs) should be used to reach children in high-risk areas. The frequency and geo-graphic scope of SNIDs and LIDs should reflect the epidemiology of polio inthe country or neighboring countries. Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and laboratory investigation. AFP surveil- lance should be established in all polio-endemic or recently polio-endemiccountries to ensure that all cases of polio are detected. According to WHOguidelines, the goal of AFP surveillance is to report and investigate \"any caseof acute flaccid (floppy) paralysis, including Guillian-Barre Syndrome, in a childless than 15 years and any case of suspected polio in persons of any age.\" All AFP cases within the above definition should be reported immediately and investigated within 48 hours. Two stool samples should be collected 24 to 48hours apart and within 14 days of paralysis onset for laboratory analysis. Afollow-up visit to the patient should be made after 60 days. Mop-up campaigns. Mop-up campaigns are intended for the most difficult-to- reach children in areas where wild poliovirus transmission is occurring.Immunization teams go from door to door over a large geographic area toadminister two doses of OPV (at a four-week interval) to all children less thanfive years of age, regardless of their immunization status. Mop-up activitiesmay also include an active search for new AFP cases.What Is Polio Eradication? Polio eradication has been defined as the absence of cases and the absence of wild poliovirus everywhere in the world. 242Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines Vaccine-Preventable Ellyn Ogden, Tracey Goodman, and Bjorn Melgaard.

Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is caused by a bacillus ( Clostridium tetani ) that is present in the soil and in animal and human feces. Afterentering the body through a wound,the bacterium produces a toxin thatmakes muscles rigid, causes spasms,and makes breathing difficult or impossible, resulting in death. It is the onlyvaccine-preventable disease that is not spread from person to person. A typical feature of the spasms associated with tetanus is the facial expression known as \"risus sardonicus,\" or sardonic smile, as shown in the photograph. Identification Neonatal tetanus affects newborn babies and results from contamination with tetanus spores that occurs when babies are delivered in unclean conditions. Maternal tetanus strikes women during pregnancy or within six weeks of the termination of pregnancy. Women are exposed to tetanus when non-sterileinstruments or objects are used during and after delivery, including duringnon-sterile abortions. Credit: WHO WHO-Recommended Case Definition: Neonatal Tetanus Suspected case: Any neonatal death between three and 28 days of age in which the cause of death is unknown; or any neonate reported as having suffered fromneonatal tetanus between three and 28 days of age and not investigated. Confirmed case: Any neonate with a normal ability to suck and cry during the first two days of life, AND who, between three and 28 days of age, cannot suck normallyAND becomes stiff or has spasms (i.e., jerking of the muscles), or both. Note: The basis for case classification is entirely clinical and does not depend upon laboratory confirmation. Neonatal tetanus cases reported by physicians are consid-ered confirmed. However, investigators should review neonatal tetanus case recordsduring annual hospital record reviews. Source: WHO244Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesChildhood and adult tetanus can result from contaminated wounds. Tetanus toxoid in a variety of formulations protects against tetanus. Transmission - Tetanus is not contagious. The disease can occur in any incompletely immunized person when tetanus spores in dirt, dung, or ashesenter a person's body through a break in the skin. Clusters of cases are some-times seen among unimmunized populations sharing the same risk factors,e.g., delivery care from a practitioner who uses unsafe practices. Population at Risk - Everyone who is unprotected through immunization is at risk. Estimated Morbidity and Mortality - Every year, an estimated 200,000 infants die from tetanus in their first month of life. Only 5% of casesare reported because health workers seldom see infants who die at homesoon after birth. Neither the birth nor the early death will be registered in vitalevents systems. The case fatality rate of tetanus is approximately 80%. In addi-tion, maternal tetanus causes an estimated 30,000 deaths per year. As shown in the graph, the proportion of neonatal tetanus deaths to total neonatal mortality does not stay constant. In high-mortality environments,neonatal tetanus is invariably a big killler of children. This is not the case inlow-mortality environments such as Europe and the Americas. There are many Tetanus as a Cause of Neonatal Mortality If the total neonatal mortality rate exceeds 30 per 1000 live births, the burden due to neonatal tetanus is substantial.Source: Steinglass et al., 1993245Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable Diseasesreasons for this. Neonatal tetanus declines as socioeconomic conditions, including sanitation and personal hygiene, improve; the proportion of the pop-ulation engaged in agriculture diminishes; agriculture becomes mechanizedand chemical fertilizers replace use of animal manure; fertility declines; child-birth becomes more hygienic; and the use of preparations containing tetanustoxoid increases. However, without waiting for these general improvements insocioeconomic conditions, one of the most rapid and efficient ways to reduceneonatal mortality in high mortality environments is to tackle the problem ofneonatal tetanus through better immunization coverage. Occurrence - Tetanus occurs worldwide. Maternal and neonatal tetanus are considered public health problems in 57 countries. The following characteristics may indicate that tetanus is a problem in a particular location: Low tetanus toxoid vaccination coverage among women Poor access to or use of any health service Poor access to or use of antenatal care services Home deliveries not assisted by skilled attendants Population engaged in agriculture Proximity of farm animals Low literacy levels and low income These areas are often \"silent areas\" where disease surveillance is weak and people do not notify health workers of tetanus cases or deaths. Treatment - Excellent 24-hour-a-day nursing care and careful use of drugs can reduce the case fatality rate in neonatal tetanus from 80% to50% or lower. Recovery from tetanus does not provide immunity. Tetanus Toxoid Tetanus can be prevented if the client receives sufficient doses of vaccine, appropriately spaced. 246Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesForm and Presentation - Tetanus toxoid is available in different formula- tions for different age groups, as shown below. Tetanus toxoid is also available as DTP in combination with hepatitis B and/or Hib vaccines. Efficacy - After a primary series of three tetanus toxoid doses, clinical effica- cy is virtually 100%. Protection falls over time and routine boosters are recom-mended every 10 years. Side Effects DTP vaccine :Mild fever and pain are common reactions; many infants also have a mild local reaction with redness and swelling. Rarely, severe systemicreactions, such as seizures, neurological complications, and anaphylaxis, fol-low DTP vaccination. Tetanus toxoid: The most common reported event following tetanus toxoid vac- cination is a local reaction and pain, which increases in frequency and severi-ty with the number of doses a person receives. Serious reactions to tetanustoxoid are rare. Contraindications - There are no contraindications to DTP. However, DTP, DT, and Td should not be given to individuals who have suffered a severereaction to a previous dose. DTP should not be given to children seven yearsof age or older. There are no contraindications to tetanus toxoid; it is safe to give it at any time, even in the first trimester of pregnancy.Tetanus Toxoid Does Not Cause Abortion or Sterilization Because tetanus toxoid is given to women of childbearing age, some people incorrectly perceive it to be a method of birth control or sterilization. Health workers need to findout whether this is believed in their areas and to correct any misinformation. Respectedlocal leaders may be especially useful in getting the right information to the community. Tetanus Toxoid Presentations Presentation Antigens Primary Age Group DTPDiphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis vaccineChildren under one year of age DTDiphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid Children through six years of age TdTetanus toxoid with reduced diphtheria contentChildren seven years of age and older, and adults TT Tetanus toxoid Adults247Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesSchedules and Target Ages - For the prevention of tetanus in infants and children, three doses of DTP should be given at six, 10, and 14 weeks of age. If a child does not get the second dose of DTP at the scheduled time, it should be given at the earliest opportunity, and the third dose should be given after afour-week interval. Children do not have to begin a series of vaccinationsagain if a dose is delayed. For the prevention of tetanus in women through their childbearing years and in their newborns, women should receive five doses of tetanus toxoid. Thetable below shows the schedule by dose and the length of protection provided. Td can be used instead of TT to protect against both tetanus and diphtheria. Women who have received three doses of DTP during childhood or additional doses of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine during their school years do notneed all five doses of TT in adulthood for protection. They must retain theirvaccination cards for health workers to determine the number of additionaldoses they do need.

TT: Each 0.5 ml dose is injected intramuscularly into the upper arm. Booster Doses of DTP after a Child's First Year - For longer-lasting protection, countries that have reached high coverage with the primary DTPseries may give one or two booster doses after children reach one year ofage. The booster dose can be in the form of DTP or DT. When one booster isgiven, it is administered in the second year of life. When two are given, thefirst injection is given in the second year, and the second between four andsix years of age. DTP should not be given to children after they reach the age of seven years due to the increased risk of adverse reactions to the pertussis component forolder children. These children should be given DT or Td. Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination Strategies - Because tetanus spores are found in the environment, tetanus cannot be eradicated.However, it can be eliminated as a public health problem. UNICEF, WHO, and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) have joined together to support the achievement of maternal and neonatal tetanus elimina-tion by 2005. To achieve this goal, the organizations recommend twostrategies: The administration of three doses of tetanus toxoid to at least 80% of all women of childbearing age in districts at highest risk. The intervalbetween the first and second dose is a minimum of four weeks. Betweenthe second and third dose, the minimum interval is six months. Threedoses at appropriate intervals will provide immunity lasting at least fiveyears. Health education and promotion of clean delivery practices focusing on the \"three cleans\": clean hands (washing hands with soap and water),clean delivery surface, and the use of clean instruments to tie and cut theumbilical cord.Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination - Definitions Neonatal tetanus elimination is defined as the reduction of neonatal tetanus cases to fewer than one case per 1000 live births in every district of every country. Because maternal tetanus elimination has not been defined, the achievement of neona- tal tetanus elimination is used as a proxy for maternal tetanus elimination.249Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesBecause tetanus cannot be eradicated, health officials must take steps to main- tain the status of elimination year after year. To do this, UNICEF, WHO andUNFPA recommend: Routine vaccination of pregnant women with tetanus toxoid. Routine vaccination of infants with DTP. Access to and use of clean delivery services. Surveillance to identify high-risk areas, assess service quality, and monitor the maintenance of elimination status. School-based vaccination programs with Td or TT.Identification of High-Risk Areas High-risk areas are districts with a reliable reported or estimated rate of neonatal tetanus cases greater than one case per 1000 live births. If neonatal tetanus surveillance is not sensitive enough to rely on a count of cases, planners find out whether 70% or more deliveries are made by a physician, nurse, ortrained midwife. This is defined as a \"clean delivery.\" If clean delivery coverage is lower than 70%, planners look at TT2+ coverage, which, if below 80%, makes the district high-risk. School-Based Immunization Immunization of schoolgirls and schoolboys with one dose of TT or Td annually duringthe first three years of primary school protects them from tetanus during their childhoodand young adulthood. Immunization of the schoolgirl population helps to preventmaternal and neonatal tetanus for first-time mothers and young women at risk. The school-based strategy is effective only where a high proportion of girls attends pri- mary school.250Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: \"Eliminating neonatal tetanus.\" A Better Future for Children: Progress Toward World Summit Goals for Health and Nutrition: A series of briefing papers prepared for the UN Special Session on Children.Arlington, VA.

EPI/GAG/87/WP.11.251Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesTuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic disease that affects people of all ages and is one of themost important public health problemsworldwide. National routine immunizationprograms use the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin(BCG) vaccine to prevent miliary andmeningeal TB in the first years of life. BCGoffers limited protection against tuberculosisin older children and adults. Identification - TB is caused by Myobacterium tuberculosis . It usually attacks the lungs, but other parts of the body canalso be affected, including the bones, joints,and brain. While nearly half of a develop-ing country's population may be infected,only one-half to 1% of these individuals willshow radiological evidence of the disease. Transmission - TB is spread through the air when a person with the disease coughs, spits, or sneezes. Because it is highly contagious, it spreads rapidlywhere people are living in crowded situations, are poorly nourished, and can-not obtain treatment.WHO-Recommended Case Definition: Tuberculosis Tuberculosis suspect: any person who presents with symptoms or signs suggestive of tuberculosis, in particular cough of long duration. Case detection: the activity of identifying infectious cases, mainly among adults attending an out-patient health facility for any reason with cough for two or three weeks or more, through sputum smear examination. Case Definitions A case of tuberculosis: a patient in whom tuberculosis has been bacteriologically con- firmed, or has been diagnoses by a clinician. Note: Any person given treatment for tuberculosis should be recorded. A definite tuberculosis case: a patient with culture positive for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (in countries where culture is not routinely available, a patient with two sputum smears positive for acid-fast bacilli [AFB] is Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesChildren can contract tuberculosis any time after birth. Infection is almost always transmitted from another family member and frequently takes placebefore the source case knows that he or she has the disease. Population at Risk - The disease is most commonly seen in adults but affects infants, children, and adolescents as well and is often more serious foryounger people. Infants are more likely than adults to contract miliary andmeningeal TB, which attack vital organs and are usually fatal. Estimated Morbidity and Mortality - Nearly two million people die from tuberculosis each year. It is estimated that nearly 1% of the world's popu-lation is newly infected with tuberculosis each year. Occurrence - TB occurs all over the world. Industrialized countries showed downward trends in incidence for many years until the 1980s, when morbidi-ty remained stable or increased in areas with an elevated prevalence of HIVinfection. Developing countries also are experiencing increases in incidence ofTB associated with high rates of HIV infection. Treatment - Patients with TB formerly required expensive and long-term care, but many people did not stay with their treatment course long enough tobe cured. At the same time, they became resistant to anti-tuberculosis drugs. Inresponse, the \"DOTS\" strategy was developed for both treatment and control.DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment - Short-course) is a standardized shortcourse of chemotherapy. BCG Vaccine BCG vaccine protects infants infected with TB from progressing to more dan- gerous forms of the disease and gives them some protection against recur-rence at a later age. BCG does not prevent TB itself and provides littleprotection against the pulmonary forms. It is not recommended for adults. Form and Presentation - BCG vaccine is freeze-dried, so it must be reconstituted with BCG diluent made by the same manufacturer as the vac-cine. Like other reconstituted vaccines, BCG has a short life span and, oncereconstituted, must be used or disposed of within six hours. The First Step toward a Fully Immunized Child BCG coverage rates are the highest of all vaccines because it is a single-dose vaccine given at or soon after birth, when children are more likely to be in contact with thehealth care system than later in life. When this encounter with the health system is asatisfactory one for the parents, they are likely to return for other vaccinations andother health services.253Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesEfficacy - Vaccination of uninfected children with BCG vaccine can provide protection for more than 90%, but the protective effect varies. Side Effects - An injection of BCG vaccine normally results in a small sore approximately the diameter of a pencil. The sore usually heals by itself andleaves a small round scar, which health workers look for to determine whethera child has been effectively immunized. However, the absence of a scar doesnot mean that the BCG vaccination did not work. When given properly, BCG vaccine has no side effects other than the ulcera- tion described above. However, local reactions, such as abscesses and inflam-mation of the lymph glands, may occur if too much vaccine is given or thevaccine is injected under the skin instead of in its top layer. Contraindications - BCG should be given to all infants, even if their moth- ers have HIV, unless an infant shows HIV/AIDS symptoms, which is highlyunlikely. Since testing infants for HIV before they are vaccinated is generallynot feasible, virtually all newborns should receive BCG. This practice will protect HIV-positive and -negative children who are at high risk of exposure to tuberculosis because their mothers are HIV-infected. Schedule and Target Age Group - All countries with a high incidence of TB infection should routinely immunize infants with a single dose of BCG atbirth. If not given at birth, BCG may be given at the infant's first contact withthe health system. Administration - The 0.05 ml dose of BCG is injected intradermally into the upper arm, just below the deltoid insertion site. Some vaccine manufactur-ers recommend a 0.1 ml dose for children older than 12 months presentingfor their first dose. Health workers administer BCG in the same place on everychild so that their colleagues know where to look for the BCG scar. The pres-ence of such a scar has been used as evidence for prior BCG vaccination. BCG Injections Health workers say that BCG is the most difficult vaccine to administer because new- borns' arms are so tiny and the vaccine must be injected intradermally, that is, in thetopmost layer of the skin. Health workers need extensive and continuing practice tomaster this skill. A short narrow needle (15 mm, 26 gauge) is needed for this injection. All other vac- cines are given with a longer, wider needle (commonly 25 mm, 23 gauge), either sub-cutaneously or intramuscularly.254Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesReferences Vaccine.\" Vaccines, Immunization and Biologicals.

Outbreaks with major public health impact may occur suddenly, with case fatality rates ranging from 20%up to 60%. Identification - Yellow fever begins with a sudden onset of fever and chills, head, back and muscle pain, nausea, and vomiting. These may progress tojaundice and hemorrhaging. Transmission - The agent that causes yellow fever is a mosquito-born virus that has three transmission cycles, sylvatic, intermediate and urban. All threetypes exist in Africa; only sylvatic and urban exist in South America. The trans-mission of yellow fever within these cycles ranges from causing sporadiccases to severe urban epidemics. Sylvatic or jungle yellow fever occurs when monkeys living in tropical rain forests are infected with yellow fever by wild mosquitoes; yellow fever is thentransmitted from monkeys to other mosquitoes. The infected mosquitoes canthen bite humans who enter the forest for hunting, logging, or other activities,resulting in sporadic cases of yellow fever. Intermediate yellow fever transmission occurs in humid or semi-humid savannahs of Africa and can produce small-scale epidemics in rural villages.Semi-domestic mosquitoes can infect both monkey and human hosts, andincreased contact between humans and infected mosquitoes leads to anincrease in disease. This is the most common type of outbreak seen in Africain recent decades. WHO-Recommended Case Definition: Yellow Fever Clinical description: An illness characterized by acute onset of fever followed by jaundice within two weeks of onset of first symptoms and one of the following: 1)bleeding from nose, gums, skin, or gastrointestinal tract; or 2) death within threeweeks of illness onset. Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: Isolation of yellow fever virus, or Presence of yellow fever-specific IgM or a fourfold or greater rise in serum IgG levels, or Positive post-mortem liver histopathology, or Detection of yellow fever antigen in tissues by immunohistochemistry, or Detection of yellow fever virus genomic sequences in blood or organs by PCR. Source: WHO, 1998256Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesUrban yellow fever results in large explosive epidemics when travelers from rural areas introduce the virus into urban areas with high human populationdensities. Domestic mosquitoes, the Aedes aegypti , carry the virus from person to person. These outbreaks tend to spread outward from one source to cover awide area. Population at Risk - In the Americas, yellow fever occurs predominantly in adult males, 20 to 40 years old, who are exposed to the disease in the jun-gle. In Africa, the disease attacks all ages and both sexes. Estimated Morbidity and Mortality - Yellow fever surveillance is poor, and the disease is seriously under-reported. Although fewer than 5000 yellowfever cases were actually reported in 2000, WHO estimates that, in sub-Saharan Africa alone, 200,000 cases and 30,000 deaths are attributable toyellow fever every year. Occurrence - In 2001, more than 30 countries were considered at risk for yellow fever in Africa. These countries are located in a band 15\u00b0N to 10\u00b0S ofthe equator. In the same year, nine South American countries and severalCaribbean islands were at risk of the disease. Areas at Risk for Yellow Fever Treatment - Although there is no approved and accepted antiviral medica- tion for the treatment of yellow fever, supportive care to increase hydrationand prevent hypoglycemia can improve the outcome. 257Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesYellow Fever Vaccine Immunization of children who are nine months of age or older with 17D yel- low fever vaccine is the best protection. Inclusion of older age groups may beappropriate among populations and within areas at high risk of epidemics. Asingle dose provides protection against the disease for at least 10 years andoften for 30 years or more. Form and Presentation - Yellow fever vaccine is freeze-dried, so it must be reconstituted with yellow fever diluent made by the same manufacturer.Once the vaccine is reconstituted, it must be used or disposed of within sixhours. Efficacy - An injection of yellow fever vaccine is effective in almost 99% of recipients. Side Effects - Children may get fever, headache, or mild muscle and joint pain after an injection of yellow fever vaccine. Encephalitis has been reported following yellow fever vaccination of a few infants younger than six months, leading to the recommendation that the vac-cine not be given before that age, even in an outbreak. In those rare cases when yellow fever vaccine causes severe systemic disease, it is only in adults. Contraindications - There are no contraindications for giving yellow fever vaccine to children older than six months of age, except for HIV. WHO rec-ommends that yellow fever vaccinations should not be given to patients withsymptomatic HIV infection or to pregnant women. Schedule and Target Age Group - One dose should be given to chil- dren at nine months of age, at the same time as measles vaccine. Administration - The 0.5 ml dose is given subcutaneously in the upper right arm. Control Strategies - At-risk countries should offer immunization against yel- low fever on a routine basis to infants. With support available from GAVI,more programs are setting up routine systems for yellow fever vaccinations. In addition to immunization, the destruction of mosquito breeding sites and the use of insecticide-treated bednets reduces the mosquito population therebyreducing transmission of mosquito-born diseases such as yellow fever, denguefever, and malaria.258Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesReferences WHO. 1998.

It may be exacer-bated by infections such as malariaand measles and by parasites suchas hookworm. Related vitamin Adeficiency (VADD) includesubclinical and clinical problems.Mortality and morbidity caused bythese disorders increase with theseverity of deficiency. Identification - In 2001, the International Vitamin A Consultative Group (IVACG) issued the criteria shown in the table below for assessing the extentand severity of vitamin A deficiency in populations. Credit: Mizan Siddiqi Prevalence Criteria Indicating Significant Vitamin A Deficiency Clinical Criteria Population Group Indicator Prevalence (%) Children 2 to 5 years of age Night blindness >1.0 Bitot's spots >0.5 Corneal xerosis and corneal scars >0.01 Corneal scars >0.05 Women of childbearing age Night blindness during recent pregnancy >5.0 Biochemical Criteria Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesTransmission - Vitamin A deficiency is not contagious. Population at Risk - Young children and women of childbearing age in low-income countries where intake of vitamin A is inadequate are most at risk. Estimated Morbidity and Mortality - In the mid-1990s, xerophthalmia (which includes eye problems ranging from night blindness through cornealscars) was estimated to affect more than three million children annually.Subclinical vitamin A deficiency, which has no signs or symptoms, affected150 to 200 million. At least one million deaths of young children are attrib-uted to VAD every year. Occurrence - Vitamin A deficiency occurs widely where diets are deficient in nutritious foods. Recent evidence indicates that the predominantly plant-based diets in many developing countries are unlikely to provide adequateamounts of vitamin A to meet the needs of young children. The problem of VAD is particularly acute for infants because they are born with virtually no stores of vitamin A. Breastmilk as an infant's first and onlyfood can provide this nutrient, but where maternal vitamin A status is poor,breastfed infants are likely to be subclinically deficient in vitamin A by sixmonths of age. Treatment - Children with measles should be treated with two doses of vita- min A on consecutive days; the size of the doses depends on the age, asshown in the table above. A third dose should be given two to four weekslater, if there are signs of xerophthalmia. Children with severe malnutritionshould be given age-appropriate doses on two consecutive days. Women of childbearing age with night blindness or Bitot's spots should receive daily doses of not more than 10,000 IU or weekly doses of not morethan 25,000 IU for at least three months duration. If a woman shows acutecorneal lesions, she should receive a dose of not more than 200,000 IU ondays one, two, and 14 after diagnosis.Vitamin A Treatment for Xerophthalmia in Infants and Children Target Group Vitamin A dosage (IU) Schedule Young infants (0-5 months) 50,000 Three doses administered on days 1, 2 and 14 followingdiagnosis Older infants (6-11 months) 100,000 Children (males -12 months or more; females -12 months to 12 years)200,000261Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines and Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesVitamin A Supplementation Vitamin A supplementation for infants, children, and postpartum women is used as a preventive strategy until all members of the population are certainto get an adequate intake of vitamin A through breastfeeding, improved dietwith dark green or yellow vegetables, and food fortification. Two 200,000 IU doses of vitamin A should be given to women within six weeks after delivery at least 24 hours apart. This will benefit the woman,replacing the losses from her vitamin A stores caused by pregnancy and lacta-tion. It will also benefit the infant by increasing breast milk and infant serumretinol concentrations. Form and Presentation - Vitamin A is usually given in an oil-based solu- tion in soft gelatin capsules that contain 50,000, 100,000, or 200,000 IU.The capsules should be kept dry and out of direct sunlight, but it is not neces-sary to keep them in the cold chain. They should not be frozen. Side Effects - High-dose vitamin A supplements cause nausea, vomiting, and headache in 3 to 9% of children aged one to four years, but these sideeffects resolve spontaneously within 48 hours. In neonates and young infantsunder the age of 6 months, about the same percentage may develop a tran-sient bulging fontanelle; this also subsides within 24 to 72 hours. Contraindications - Women who are pregnant, or who may become pregnant, should not consume more than 10,000 IU per day or 25,000 IUper week.

As NIDs are phasing out with progress toward polio eradication goals, health officials are trying to integrate vitamin A supplementation into the routineimmunization schedule and distribute supplements through periodic outreach(e.g., health weeks or days). To date, coverage has been far higher using periodic outreach than through integration, as illustrated by the example below. A Model for Delivery of Vitamin A Supplementation The National Vitamin A Supplementation Program in Nepal has achieved high cover-age throughout the country, and it appears that this coverage can be sustained. Thesuccess of the program has been attributed to: phased-in implementation, technicalsupport by a national NGO (Nepali Technical Assistance Group), and participation ofvolunteers that have been serving children and families since 1988. Recognizing the importance of training the Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) to provide quality services, the government of Nepal began vitamin A distri-bution in 32 high-priority districts instead of trying to launch the program countrywideimmediately. The national program supported training, logistics, and community mobi-lization in the selected districts prior to the first distribution and later assisted withrefresher training managed by district staff. After the first two distribution rounds, dis-tricts manage subsequent rounds with minimal additional input from the program,which goes on to support new districts. Community involvement also plays a role. The national program first collected data from focus groups and key informants and developed an overall strategy based on thefindings. The program encouraged districts to review the findings and decide whatmethods might work best in their districts. Parades, involvement of schools, magicshows, and involvement of local political leaders were used. Today, the program is sowell known that once distribution dates are known, parents and other caregivers needlittle prompting to participate. Now, more than 40,000 FCHVs administer a round of vitamin A supplements to chil- dren six to 60 months of age every six months throughout Nepal, and they are reach-ing 94% of the target population. This distribution is independent of polio NIDs. Source: R. Houston, 2002 263Immunization Essentials Chapter 12: Vaccines Vaccine-Preventable DiseasesReferences Goodman, Tracey, N.
