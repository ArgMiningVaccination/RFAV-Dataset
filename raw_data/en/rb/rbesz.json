The overall 5-year survival rate of many cancers, including liver, lung, pancreas, bone, and advanced breastcancer, has not increased in the past 30 years, after $45 billion spent on research and seven million casualties. Today, 42% ofAmericans can expect to develop cancer in his or her lifetime, and24% are expected to die from it. On a worldwide basis, cancer is fast replacing heart disease as the number one cause of deathin adults. These are real numbers, and affecting real people, including your loved ones. In fact, the next victim may be you.Effective treatments are lacking for many cancers, especially inadvance stages. This book is about how to stay alive if you havecancer. Plain and simple. This book is written because it's time for conventional doctors to admit that the current medical approach to cancer bycut (surgery), poison (chemotherapy), and burn (radiationtherapy) isn't working as well as it should. The current paradigm started 150 years ago with the advent of drug-based allopathic medicine advocated by Western scientists.What was considered traditional medicine (much of it using naturalnon-toxic compounds) then, was swept quickly to the side andlabeled as quackery. Medical societies set up strict guidelines forphysicians to follow, and anyone not abiding by the pre-set protocolshad their license revoked, and some were even jailed. For the pastcentury, cancer specialists have been continuing on the same pathof treatment which they know are unlikely to make much positivedifference in the lives of their patients in the majority of cancer cases. Perhaps this blindness has to do with the sad reality that physicianspracticing outside prescribed conventional protocols can and willcontinue to lose their license, that offending big drug companies that10Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine sponsor research can be a big mistake, and being labeled as quacks by their colleagues is no fun. No wonder physicians are afraid of newapproaches to healing cancer. No wonder patients all over the world are moving away from conventional therapies in search of betteroptions. The good news is that more and more doctors are accepting alternative cancer therapy to augment conventional treatment.I was in the same boat some years back, as a Western-trainedallopathic doctor, following the standardized protocol and entrenchedpolicies set down by our respected medical board. It was so mucheasier then. To learn that there are scientifically sound naturalalternatives to cancer therapy is indeed a painful and humblingexperience. It is easier to turn away from the truth and continue onthe merry way of accepted mediocrity. To face the truth requires thatI unlearn many of the \"proven\" theories of modern medicine, anadmission that many such theories taught to us in medical schoolare downright wrong, and to relearn the real truth of medicine. Thisrequires spending time not with information from drug companiesand journals funded by drug companies, but revisiting thebiochemistry textbooks, countless hours on Medline to keep up withthe latest research, and open discussions with natural-orientedhealthcare professionals. In the end, I saw the light. The light that conventional therapies have failed, that scientifically-basednatural non-toxic therapies do exist and have existed for centuries, and most importantly, should be used in a clinical setting for thebenefit of our cancer patients. We need the best of both worlds, and it is available. My message is simple, direct, and lifesaving: cancer can be beaten using non-toxic natural compounds and modalities inconjunction with conventional therapy. This combinationapproach is the treatment of choice for most cancers. This book will show you the logic behind this approach and how to use it.Natural medicine is an effective tool against cancer. It can be11beautifully and successfully incorporated into the conventional treatment program in addition to being a stand-alone alternative attimes. There is no \"single cure\" for cancer and none is proposed, conventional or otherwise. What is available is the judicious use ofmultiple natural treatments and natural compounds working together- synergistically - to effect major changes in the cancer process,from containment to remission to a life that is cancer free. In otherwords, you don't have to become a statistic. This book is not an attack on the medical profession or conventional treatment protocols which have their place. This book does notpromise natural therapy as a sole substitute. This book does advocatethe use of natural therapies as an adjunct therapy to mostconventional therapies. To do that, we start with exploring the currentstate of the cancer war and what causes cancer from a naturalperspective. Before natural medicine can be taken seriously, itsfoundational basis must be examined and scrutinized. After we aresatisfied with the science behind the concept of natural medicine,we move on to study, one chapter at a time, the parameters withinwhich natural medicine works as an anti-cancer tool. When you havefinished the book, I hope that you have a better understanding ofour body as it is indeed a miraculous ecosystem and not simply amechanical device as we were taught to believe; that when theecosystem is in a dysfunctional state, symptoms such as cancercan arise; most importantly, that this ecosystem can be brought backto homeostasis naturally with non-toxic compounds and lifestylechanges, with resulting reversal of cancer. As you will see, all of us already have cancer cells in our body, but not all of us will end up with cancer in the hospital. In fact, the average adult at age 60 will already have about six bouts of cancerwithout knowing it, due to the superb job performed by our immune system over the years to keep the cancer in check. When you havea detectable tumor, your goals are clear and specific - how to destroythe trillions of cancer cells that are ravaging your body. TheIntroduction12Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine conventional strategy of containment simply does not work due to the sheer number of cancerous cells present and circulating but notdetectable by current diagnostic standards. Only by combiningtraditional strategies of confinement advanced by conventionalmedicine plus enhancing our body's immune system, togetherwith an optimized internal terrain with natural medicine that isnon-toxic, does. Some of you may think that \"If it were any good, my doctor would know about it\". Yes, your doctor would eventually know. The question is when, and whether you have the time to wait. Dissemination ofnew information takes decades (likely to be anywhere from 10 to 20years) and not months in the case of natural medicine. Much of the scientific information presented here is years ahead of its time. The number of practitioners of natural and nutritional medicine is limited, and those with orthomolecular oncologybackground even less. I am proud to join my fellow learnedcolleagues, whose names you may be familiar with, such ascardiologist Robert Atkins, MD, winner of the National HealthFederation's Man of the Year Award and author of numerous booksincluding Dr Atkin's Health Revolution ; Ernesto Contreras MD, chief oncologist at the famed cancer-focused Oasis Hospital in Mexico;conventional and alterative oncologist James Forsythe, MD, HMD,associate professor of medicine at the University of Nevada; andAbram Hoffer, MD, PhD, clinician and author of Orthomolecular Medicine for Physicians, to offer patients a balanced approach to cancer treatments. What is proposed in this book isn't the least bitcomplex or unreasonable. Natural medicine is the \"true\" medicine that is time-tested and has been around for centuries. It fact, itis radical only in its common sense approach. What is proposed, however, is simply outside the current paradigm of conventionalmedicine, despite the overwhelming science behind many ofthese therapies.13Now more than ever, we realize that maintaining proper balance is the key to most things in life. Work needs to be balanced with play.Solitude needs to be balanced with social activities. The treatmentof choice in most degenerative diseases has now turned from simplyreaching a \"target\" of any single laboratory test \"score\" to a morecomplete and balanced approach of managing key ratios. Forexample, achieving an ideal laboratory total cholesterol level aloneis hardly the right strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk. The key isthe balance of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio. Similarly, itis not the total triglyceride in our blood that is a risk factor, rather thetotal triglyceride to HDL cholesterol ratio. The same applies to thebalance of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids, estrogen to progesteroneand zinc to copper. The list goes on. A balanced approach is indeedneeded in cancer treatment. Taking in the best of both conventionaland natural medicine in a complementary and integrated fashionmakes the most sense if you want to maximize your lifespan, whetheryou have cancer or not. If you want to know how to beat cancer with natural medicine, or how to balance the use of natural medicine in the context ofconventional therapy to optimize the healing process, this book isfor you. If you have cancer but are in remission, you need this bookeven more as this is precisely the time when natural medicine playsits most profound role, helping to keep the cancer from recurring. Ifyou simply want to know how to prevent cancer naturally, there is nobetter place to start than here. As the era of the \"kill or cure\" approach to conventional cancer therapy draws to a close, the era of natural medicine focusing on biologicallysupportive therapies is making clear inroads into mainstreamoncology. Let us begin the journey of healing.Introduction14Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Read this section if you don't have time or are too weak to read the whole book.) WAR ON CANCER For the past 50 years, war on cancer has been fought with three tools - surgery (cut), radiation therapy (burn), and chemotherapy(poison). Over the same period, there have been rapid improvementsin technology and medical science. One would expect medicaltreatments and success rates for cancer to improve steadily. Buthave they? The answer is an emphatic no. Since 1950, the overall cancer incidence has increased by 44%, with breast cancer and male colon cancer up by 60% and prostate cancer up by 100%. 44% of Americans living today are expected to develop cancer. For decades, the 5-year survival rate has remained constant for non-localized breast cancer at 18% and lung cancer at 13%. Groupedtogether, the average cancer patient has a 50/50 chance of livinganother 5 years, which are the same odds he or she had in 1971. If one takes a longer view, the numbers become scarier. For example, the overall 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is about 75%,but the extended survival rate (beyond 5 years) is less then50%. For prostate cancer, the picture is not much brighter, with 5-year survival at about 85%, and 10-year survival at only 35%.15CANCER - ACCORDING TO NATURAL MEDICINE While conventional medicine primarily treats cancer as a focal disease with localized symptoms, naturally oriented physicians thinkotherwise. Naturally oriented physicians think of the body as a closedinternal ecosystem, and believe that it is the dysfunction of thisecosystem that is primarily responsible for the development of cancer. No treatment, conventional or otherwise, can completely eliminate all cancer cells according to the naturally oriented physician. The reason is simple. Cancer is a systemic disease, and there are simply too many cancerous or pro-cancerous cellswithin the ecosystem of the body. Cancer is not a localized problem but a whole-body phenomenon of metastatic growth. Its growth process is affected by biological conditions. Non-genetically basedcancer forms in the body because of toxins, the lack of oxygen,poor nutrition, and other factors such as hormonal imbalance.Whether the cancer in our body continues to multiply depends to alarge degree on our body's biological terrain. It is this terrain thatdetermines how the cancer is expressed. Naturally oriented doctors view cancer as a chronic, systemic and metabolic dysfunction of the genetical intracellular makeup. In manycases, it can be considered a controllable chronic illness. Tumors are only the symptoms of the submicroscopic dysfunctional causes.The root of cancer therefore lies in the progress of growth andmetastasis, and not the tissue in which the tumor was first detected. The naturally oriented doctor therefore fights cancer by optimizing the internal terrain and enabling the patient's internalsystem to destroy the tumor. It enhances the patient's health so that cancer cells cannot grow and multiply.Executive Summary16Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine The Rate of Success The use of non-toxic natural therapies has achieved huge successes over the past few decades. Extensive studies have proven them tohave an edge over conventional therapies. Some of the examplesare listed below. Many of the alternative cancer hospitals are found in Mexico. For example, Dr Contreras of the Oasis Hospital reported that his5-year survival rate for prostate cancer is 83% when using naturaltreatment compared to 73% for conventional treatment. At the American Metabolic Institute, renowned scientist Dr Geronimo Rubio reported success rates in reversing stage III and IV cancersfrom 65 to 75%. The reversal rate for stage I and II cancers is 80%. While the 5-year survival for ending stage cancer using conventional therapy is 9% overall, alternative cancer hospitals report that theirsis more than 30%. While 4% of terminal cancer patients show noresponse to alternative treatments, the other 96% can expect somebenefits after a month of treatment. There is therefore no turningback for patients who have bravely embarked on the path ofalternative treatments. Clearly, the success rate of natural treatment is so much better than for many conventional cancer treatment. As such, if you or your family members have cancer, you should consider allforms of alternative treatment before deciding on which program toembark on. Today, many patients opt for combination therapy, usingboth conventional and alternative cancer treatments. This combined therapy is becoming more and more popular as the successrates are higher.17Integrating natural and conventional therapies Human and animal studies have shown successful and amazing results when chemotherapeutic agents and natural compounds areused in combination. The objectives and rationale behind combining conventional therapies with natural treatments are as follows: 1. To give a safer and more effective dose to reduce the negative side effects. 2.To help build healthy cells' resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and increase drug accumulation in cancer cells. 3.To increase additive or synergistic cytotoxic effect with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Know Your Enemy Here are 10 cancer facts you must know to fight the battle and win. 1. Mitochondria The mitochondria is the energy factory of the cell. This is the engineroom, so to say. Fortification of mitochondrial function will help cellular energy generation. Cancer cells prefer sugar as a source of energy as compared to normal cells which favor oxygen. This isan inefficiency pathway of energy generation. This process drainsour body of the much-needed energy at a time when the body isweak. As a result, most cancer patients are weak and tired. 2. Free Radicals Free radicals (very reactive chemical particles) generated as a resultof environmental toxins, stress, processed food, and pollution are adirect cause of cellular mutation and cancer. Blending optimum levels of antioxidants into the therapy is a cornerstone of ananti-cancer program.Executive Summary18Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 3. Matrix Cancer cells are commonly harmless or benign. Such benign tumorsare encapsulated by fiber and the body is insulated from their toxiceffects. Cancer cells spread locally by secreting enzymes that destroythe interstitial collagen that forms the protective intercellular matrix.Reinforcing of this matrix is akin to building a wall and preventingthe cancer cells from advancing. 4. Temperature Sensitive Cancer cells are more sensitive to heat and less able to toleratehigh temperature compared to normal cells. Hyperthermia (raisingthe body temperature) should be induced, including metabolichyperthermia at the cellular level, to kill cancer cells. 5. Angiogenesis Cancer cells spread to distant sites by angiogenesis (formationof new blood vessel). Masses of cancer cells may become likeparasites, developing their own network of blood vessels andsiphoning key nutrients from the body. Some non-toxic compounds have been shown to retard this process. 6. Toxins Many cancers come on because of an excess of toxins and acompromised toxin clearance mechanism in the body. Detoxification is a key to cancer control. The liver, skin, kidney, and lung are major detoxification centers of the body. 7. Internal Terrain Our body is an internal closed ecosystem. The proper balance ofthis internal terrain by maintaining its equilibrium, for example anoptimum acid/base balance, is a key to preventing a buildup ofunwanted bacteria, fungus, and proteins (like prions) in the bodywhich can bring on cancer.198. Immunity Our first line of defense against assaults by external agents in ourbody is our immune system. Those who are immunologically stronghave a better chance of surviving cancer. 9. Hormones Most cancers have a hormonal component. The imbalance ofour hormones is a major cause of many cancers, including breastand prostate cancer. Modulation and correction of hormonalimbalance naturally will correct the systemic dysfunction upon whichhormonal sensitive cancer is kept under control. 10. Inflammation Infections, poor dietary habit or high sugar and trans-fat are potentialcarcinogens that leads to mutational changes and an exaggeratedinflammatory response that may be out of control resulting in cancer.Side effects of inflammatory response include atherosclerosis,diabetes, stroke, and hypertension. NATURAL MEDICINE - YOUR CHOICE Let me help you by outlining the three steps you should take tomake this critical decision. No one should embark on a naturalmedicine program without understanding what it is all about. It is noteasy by any means, but has its rewards. Step 1 Face the realityDo not deny that you have cancer. All adults do. You just have it more than others. You are not alone, and millions before you havethe same. What you have can be beaten. Do you want to beat cancer? It is being done all the time. Those who have the strongest reason to live also have the best odds ofExecutive Summary20Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine beating cancer. Tell yourself, \"I refuse to die!\" and list out the reasons why. Maybe it is your wish to be with your love ones, or you have amission still incomplete. Whatever the reasons may be, list themout. Without a reason to fight, no war can be won. Until your reasonsfor fighting the war on cancer are clear, do not proceed. Take yourtime to think it through. Talk to your love ones. Step 2 Do your homeworkThis is the time to gather as much knowledge, options, and data as possible. It may entail many phone calls, visits to professionals youhave never heard of in distant land, exploring options that soundslike foreign language to you. Yes this is uncharted territory for you,and you need to do your homework as quickly as possible. Thegood news is that there are professionals out there who can helpyou, and this is the time to call them. Talk to your doctor; get the official medical diagnosis, the staging, and any variance. Search the Internet for as much information as possible on the cancer you have, from both conventional and alternative sources. Verify that the prognosis and treatment plan advanced by your oncologist conforms to establishedprotocol. Write down on paper questions you may have about yourcancer. The more questions the better. Step 3 Make the decision After you have gathered all the information, you must make a decision. You only have one body, and you cannot afford not to giveit the best.217 STEPS TO BEATING CANCER NATURALLY Cancer can be beaten naturally if you are determined. There are seven things you must do from the natural medicine perspective to control cancer cell growth and beat it. They reflect acomplete approach to address the major cancer facts outlined above. All seven steps are important. Do not think that one is more important than others. You have to do all if you are serious. Startwith step 1, and move on to the next steps, one at a time, whilecontinue to do what the previous step requires. Take your time toconquer each step before moving on. Most people require aboutthree weeks per step. Beating cancer is a marathon and not a sprint. If you can move through the seven steps faster, it is even better. Step 1 Starving Cancer cell Cancer is a sugar-feeder. Learn to cut down the sugar intake (including granular and refined sugar) by up to 90% to create a low sugar environment. You do need food for energy. Change to low-glycemic index complex carbohydrates. Cut off all soda pop, most grains, rice, and potato. Step 2 Oxygenate your bodyCancer cells hate oxygen. They strive in an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment. Moderate aerobic exercise is the easiest and cheapest way to get oxygen on board. If you are too weak to do exercise, simple deep breathing is a good start. Other oxygen-generating modalities could be considered including ozone andhydrogen peroxide therapy.Executive Summary22Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Step 3 Avoid Malnutrition Forty percent of cancer patients die of malnutrition. You need good nutrition, with healthy fats and plant-based proteins to maintain nitrogen balance and muscle strength without aggravating the cancer.The amount of calories you need is determined by your physicalactivity level. It is easy to get calories in. The challenge is to getnutritious and not empty calories into your body. Stay with organic whole foods, with plenty of green leafy vegetables, low-glycemic fruits, and beans and legumes for plant-based protein. Step 4 Use Nutritional Supplements Therapeutic nutritional supplement is a cornerstone of the natural medicine because our body simply cannot get enough of them from aregular diet. A blend of at least 30-50 nutrients is needed to: 1.Prevent mutation with therapeutic doses of antioxidants. 2.Enhance mitochondrial function to increase energy production. 3.Prevent cancer growth by blocking its spread. 4.Enhance immune function to fight existing cancer cells. Step 5 Balance Your Internal terrainProbiotics, enzymes, green food, and fiber are the four key pillars to re-balance your internal milieu and pH. Use these every day toensure optimum transit time, proper absorption of nutrients from thefood you take, and proper balance of good and bad bacteria. Step 6 Balance Your Toxin LoadHundreds of toxic chemicals including mercury, lead, arsenic and cadmium have accumulated in our body through the years.23Detoxification is a process of cleaning up our ecosystem and giving it a fresh start. The key elements are: 1.Use pure filtered water as your only source of liquid, and drink plenty of it. There is no substitute. 2. Enhance our liver function with herbs such as milk thistle . Our liver is the main detoxification organ. 3. Use chelating agents to bind and remove unwanted metals and minerals. 4. Drink fresh vegetable juices. Vegetable juicing floods the body with antioxidants. Step 7 Balance Your HormonesOften misunderstood and under-appreciated, hormones have a lot more to do with cancer than we think. This is especially so withhormone-related cancers such as breast, ovary, uterus, andprostate cancers. Maintaining a balanced hormonal profile naturally is a key to well-being and longevity because we are flooded in the seaof hormones. OPTIONAL - Explore other natural therapies that are not commonly practiced in conventional medicine, such as hyperthermia, Rifefrequency generators, etc. Also not to be forgotten is to activelyparticipate in an on-going support group. GENERAL CANCER NUTRACEUTICAL MODEL When it comes to nutrition as a tool to fight cancer, protocols do not exist. Each practitioner has, from his or her own experience, arrived at a general model that has worked well.Executive Summary24Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Here is my general cancer model that serves as a basis for additional components to be added depending on each person's specificrequirement. This is not a \"protocol\", as no such protocol exists whenit comes to individualized cancer therapy. 1. Start daily with a good foundational formula consisting of at least the following: Vitamin A (antioxidant) - 15,000 IU (300% RDA) with no more than 5,000 IU in vitamin A palmitate and the rest in natural mixedbeta carotene. Vitamin C (antioxidant) - 1,000 mg (2,000% RDA) Vitamin E (antioxidant) - 300 to 400 IU (1,333% RDA) in the form of water dispersible d-alpha (the natural form). Selenium (antioxidant) - 200 mcg (285% RDA) in amino acid complex forms to enhance absorption. Magnesium (antioxidant) - 300 to 600 mg (125% RDA). The calcium to magnesium ratio should be 1:1.

Cancer in the adult canpartly be viewed as a degenerative process with symptomsrepresentative of underlying systemic dysfunction. We all havecancer cells in our bodies. It is only when our body is unable to getrid of the cancer cells that a disease process takes place. This iswhen we are diagnosed as having the fateful and fearful cancer.What are the underlying system dysfunctions? There are manyfactors, including emotional stress, diet, drugs and chemicals, infections, genetic mutation and environmental pollutants. Conventional treatments look at cancer as a disease state. The natural-oriented doctor views cancer as a set of symptomsreflecting underlying disease. The conventional treatment of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy has been the cornerstone of cancer treatment over the past 50 years.Today, the clinical success of these treatments has reached a ceiling. We need to break through this cure ceiling by trying fresh approaches. Practitioners of natural therapies range from lay people with no medical training to highly trained doctors who have departed fromtheir mainstream practice. The vast majority are doctors seeking tosupplement careful use of conventional therapies with naturalapproaches and not to replace them.27The complete natural healing program should include a therapeutic blend of vitamins, herbs, minerals and enzymes. Choosing the propercombination and dosage of these natural compounds is an importantkey to success. This comes with not only experience but also anextensive medical knowledge of the cancer process. It is thereforehighly recommended to consult a nutritionally oriented physician withan orthomolecular oncology experience before you start anytreatment program.Executive Summary28Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine29/fl1rtCHAPTER ONE MY DOCTOR IS KILLING ME! \"There is not one, but many cures for cancer available.\" Cardiologist and natural medicine pioneer Dr Robert Atkins, MD 30Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine At the age of 54, Michael Gearin-Tosh was diagnosed in 1995 with myeloma, a bone marrow cancer and one of the most lethal cancers known. Gearin-Tosh is no crackpot. He is a professor inEnglish literature at St. Catherine's College, Oxford, and a visitingprofessor at Stanford University. His friends include some of theleading conventional oncologists in the world. The usual survivaltime with conventional treatment is two to three years; without it,one year. Amazingly, seven years later, his cancer is still in remission.Gearin-Tosh remains active and remarkably robust, a fully functioningmember of society. The odds against his survival beyond three yearswere 99.995%. Stories like this are real, and it is happening everyday. How has he done it? Well, naturally of course. Gearin-Tosh rejected the universally accepted treatment for his form of cancernamely chemotherapy. He fought his cancer with a strong mentaldetermination and a truly remarkable combination of naturaltherapies, both physical and spiritual. He applied straight diet,detoxification, and a host of natural therapies designed to fortify hisbody to fight the cancer from within. He consumed enormous dailydoses of vitamin C and other antioxidants against the advice ofconventional physicians. He did Chinese breathing exercises thatdate back thousands of years. He did what every conventional doctoradvised him against, and he has survived! Gearin-Tosh had a cancerthat had been invariably fatal yet he beat it using a combination ofexceptionally unconventional natural therapies. In fact, you can readabout it in his book, Living Proof: A Medical Mutiny, published seven years after his triumph over it. Gearin-Tosh stayed away from conventional medicine, and that saved his life. Is there a foundation to his madness? Or is his survivaljust a \"lucky coincidence\"? Let us explore this more.31Doctors Are the Third Leading Cause of Death In the US! Seems hard to believe, but the most widely circulated medicalperiodical in the world, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) , published this information on July 26, 2000. Studies have shown that 225,000 people die in the US every year because of their doctor. Sounds incredible! Can it be true? Yes, many have died because of unnecessary surgery (12,000), fromwrong prescriptions given (7,000), from hospital infections (80,000),from hospital errors (20,000) and the negative effects of drugs. In fact, these statistics do not even include the negative effects that are associated with disability or discomfort arising from the abovemistakes made. As if that is not enough, another study, this one published by the same prestigious periodical in 2002, found that 10% of new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)from 1975 to 1999 have serious side effects that were notdiscovered during initial testing and marketing. Dr Karen Lasser and Dr Paul Allen from the Department of Medicine at CambridgeHospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts found that 56 out of 548 drugsapproved during this period (10%) had to have a new \"black boxwarning\". When these drugs are consumed, it may have seriousadverse reactions that result in death or serious injury. In fact, 16drugs (3%) were withdrawn and 45 (8.2%) required one or morenew black box warnings. Half of the withdrawals occurred duringthe first two years after the drug's introduction, and half of the newblack box warnings occurred during the first seven years. Therefore,many drugs with adverse effects went undetected until manyyears later. One of the drugs, terfenadine (marketed in the US as Seldane) was a popular non-sedating antihistamine. It was on themarket for 13 years before it was withdrawn because of arrhythmia.My Doctor is Killing Me!32Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Another one called cisapride (marketing in the US as Propulsid) was available for six years before it was withdrawn for a similarreason. Don't these statistics sound scary? We may unknowingly be taking the wrong drugs prescribed by our misguided doctors. We may notrealize it now but many years down the road, when the drug isbanned, it may have caused irreparable damages to our bodies. HOW GOOD IS YOUR HEALTHCARE? Studies have shown that a whopping 20 to 30% of patients in Americaare receiving inappropriate medical treatment. Out of 13 countries in a recent comparison of overall health status of its population, the United States ranks an average of 12 th, which is second from the bottom for 16 available health indicators. This isindeed not a very good sign. The poor performance of the US healthservices is also recently confirmed by a World Health Organizationsurvey, which uses different data. Once again, the United States isonly number 15 among 25 industrialized countries. What seems to be the problem? Could this be explained by the lack of medical technology, the lack of qualified doctors, or the lack offinancial resources in the United States? Well, the lack of technology is certainly not a contributing factor to the US's low ranking. Among 29 countries, the United Statesranks next to Japan in the availability of highly soph isticated m agnetic resonance imaging equipment and computer tomography scanners per million populations. Japan, however, ranks highest while USranks among the lowest in health services.33The lack of medical education does not seem to be yet another contributing factor. The average American doctor spends about 8 to10 years in medical training plus additional training in their specializedfield. This is much longer as compared to their peers in the rest ofthe world. The quality and intensity of residency training programsalso cannot be questioned. Most of the world's most prestigiousmedical schools and research facilities are in America. The US is definitely not lacking in financial resources. The US is rich and the amount of money spent on healthcare ranks among the topin the world. A real problem therefore exists in the entire allopathic medical system of healthcare and philosophy characteristic of Western medicine.Western trained doctors are highly focused on alleviation of symptoms and eradication of localized problem. They fail miserablywhen it comes to eliminating the underlying systemic problem thatis often the root of the many age-related degenerative diseases suchas hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer. The failureto accept cancer as a systemic disease is one of the greatest failuresin modern medicine. In the words of Vincent Speckhart, MD, MDH, renowned practicing oncologist of 22 years' experience: Cancer growth is looked upon as a problem and a disease, when in fact it is the result of failure of the host in which it isgrowing to maintain a healed state. Treating cancer as a disease state without attention to the underlying cause isa grave mistake. - Vincent Speckhart, past assistant clinical professor of medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical College. Homeopath since1989.My Doctor is Killing Me!34Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine If cancer is a localized problem, the traditional model will serve well. The reality is very different. Cancer is really a systemic disease with local manifestation. Until the root of the systemic dysfunction is eradicated, symptomatic treatments and local eradication is aband-aid temporary approach at best. The fact speaks for itself. Forthe past half a century, the three accepted modalities of treatment -surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy - has remainedessentially unchanged in conceptual terms. There has been nosignificant breakthrough. On the other hand, the number of Americans diagnosed annually with cancer will double over the next 50 years, from 1.3 million to2.6 million. Researchers estimated that 8.9 million people were livingwith cancer in the United States at the beginning of 1999. About60% of those were 65 or older. As the population continues to age,the incidence of cancer and the need for breakthrough rises. By2050, more than 1.1 million people 75 and older will be diagnosedwith the disease each year, up from about 400,000 today, accordingto a study released by the National Cancer Institute. Such being the case, little wonder more and more cancer patients no longer opt for traditional therapies as the only option to treatingtheir cancer. The conventional methods do not seem to work and insome cases, they have even shortened the patients' lives.Conventional allopathic doctors simply have nothing better to offer.Many patients have lost faith in them. Once bitten, twice shy, manycancer patients now look for alternative therapies. Statistics show that 40 to 80% of cancer patients are seeking alternative cancer treatments either in conjunction with or inplace of conventional treatment.35ADULT CANCER - A DEGENERATIVE DISEASE? Statisticians further tell us that 80% of us will die from heart disease, stroke and/or cancer one day. The World Health Organization has estimated that there will be more than ten milliondocumented new cases of cancer a year. In fact, cancer is fastreplacing cardiovascular disease as the number one cause of deathamong adults. We all know that heart disease and stroke are old people's diseases. Children very seldom get heart attacks or strokes. But cancer canhappen to all of us, whether you are a grandparent or an active pre-school child. Long ago, during the times of our great grandparents,cancer was looked upon as a form of sickness and a \"curse\" thatjust appeared and that was not related to the aging process.Therefore, when we get it, we get it. There is really nothing we cando about it. Let us take a closer look at this hypothesis. The incidenceof adult cancers hit a peak around age 50. The lowest incidence ofadult cancer is between ages 30 to 35. Why? Let us consider theaging process first. When we are around the age of 20 to 25 years old, our body reaches its peak of condition, that is, our health is likely to be at its highestpoint. Our hormone production will start to decelerate and we gradually begin our journey of aging. We enter into the Sub-clinical Phase of aging at age 25 as our cellular function begins its gradual decline, although it seems unnoticeable. At this point in time, wemay still feel very youthful. The thought of growing old is definitely far away from our minds and there is no outward sign of any deterioration. This phase goes on from age 25 to 35. As we grow older, say between age 35 to 45, the so-called Transition Phase of aging, symptoms such as a lower energy level and wrinkleswill be noticed. We may start to have hypothyroidism, resulting fromMy Doctor is Killing Me!36Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine the decline of thyroid hormone levels. We may also start to feel more lethargic and tired because of the decline in growth hormones.This is when some dreaded diseases such as diabetes may set in due to the onset of insulin and sugar imbalance. The incidence of cancer is still small at this stage compared to hypertension, diabetes,and atherosclerosis. Age 45 and above is the age of prosperity. Not only do we prosper in our career, we also prosper in old age diseases! We have now entered the Clinical Phase of aging. Signs and symptoms of aging become very obvious. Many of us can no longer hide our age. Ourhormone levels start to decline rapidly. We may reach our next milestone of menopause and andropause. Cancer, hypertension, and heart attacks are feared universally as they strike two out ofthree adults at this age. Cancer has now become one of the most common diseases of all adults in this group. Why does cancer hit most frequently when we are in our 50s and not in our 30s? The answer is simple. At age 50, we are older, and our body is weaker. It's common sense. Extending this hypothesis,is it not true that the longer we can stay young, the less likely it is that cancer will surface? Very few can argue against this, and the simplicity of this statement points to the very essence of adult cancer - that it is primarily an age-related disease. Let us take a look at what the aging process does to your body to excite cancer cells. Our healthy bodies are in a continuous state of balance and homeostasis. When we are physically or emotionally stressed, imbalances will occur. The body will automatically adjust and try to re-balance itself. If this compensatory mechanism fails, we fall sick with outward symptoms such as pain or fever.37Sometimes, we are sick inside without any outward symptoms because the body is able to compensate for the dysfunction without us knowing it. Due to the lack of sophisticated detection equipment, we may not know that we already have some disease such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer. In reality, they may already be well into their \"sub-clinical\" state and affecting various parts of our bodily function. Hypertension is often called the \"silent killer\", and for a good reason. It may kill you before you know it. Cancer is another one. As medical science progresses, we will be able to design sophisticated tests to detect such dysfunction earlier. We now have total body CT scans, and well advanced cardiac markers such as homocysteine and lipoprotein(a) to help us screen potential cardiac problems ahead of time. In the case of cancer, no one standardized and universally accepted screening measurement has yet been developed. Tumor markers as a screening tool are not very reliable and most of them are relatively crude. Until the cancer presents itself as a growth or show up on a scan, the patients are considered \"normal\". Most people are surprised when they learn that they have cancer. Why? Becausethey never thought that they would be the one afflicted since therenever was any sign of it. Ironically, the first symptom of cancer,according to a patient education brochure published by the AmericanCancer Society is \"no symptom\". In a world dominated by allopathicmedicine where the focus of treatment is on symptomatic relief, howcan a doctor treat cancer where there are no symptoms? And howcan a patient prevent cancer when there are no indicators to warrantprevention in the first place? In reality, all of us are born with pre-cancerous cells. Louis Pasteur, the famous Frenchman who brought us the germ theory ofdisease, is a name we all recognize. The milk we take is \"pasteurized\"My Doctor is Killing Me!38Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine to rid it of unwanted bacteria which he proved to be the cause of disease. A body in its pristine state, therefore, will not get sick,according to the thinking of that time more than a century ago. Wenow know that this is incorrect, for a pristine body simply does notexist. Pasteur, on his death bed in 1895, admitted as much andsaid, \"I have been wrong. The germ is nothing. The 'terrain' is everything\". What exactly is this terrain that Pasteur alluded to? The terrain is our internal ecosystem. It is a closed system that works 24 hours aday to keep us going. It is made up of 65 trillion cells modulated byacid/base balance, hormonal influences, structural functionality, anda delicate balance between good and bad bacteria already presentfrom birth. It is the dysfunction of this internal terrain that accountsfor most of our diseases, including cancer. \"What disrupts our internal terrain?\" you may ask. The key elements are diet, lifestyle, stress, and environmental pollution, not to mentiongenetic factors. These insults come on slowly and insidiously. We now know that 80 to 90% of all cancers are related to three major groups of risk factors: 1.Nutrition - a high-fat, high-cholesterol, low-fiber, alcohol, smoking, stress, sedentary lifestyle. 3.Environment - industrial toxics, electromagnetic radiation, chemical carcinogens, air and water pollution, among others. Our body is constantly being attacked when exposed to these risk factors. Unfortunately, the insults are so small that they are notnoticed, and it takes on average 20 years or more before symptomsof the first damage become outwardly evident. These insults attackour cellular protein structure, causing mutational changes that canlead to cancer and a variety of chronic degenerative diseases,including hypertension and diabetes. By the age of 50, it is39estimated that 30% of our cellular proteins will have been damaged. Is there any surprise that this is the time cancer surfaces most frequently? It is, therefore, fair to say that all adults (and some children) have cancerous cells in their bodies. These cells exist in a sub-clinicalstate, suppressed by our internal immunity system in their quest tokeep our internal ecosystem or internal terrain functioning optimally.When these attacks are chronic, that is when they are sustainedover time, our defense system will eventually fail, and the sub-clinicalstate of dysfunction will manifest itself with physical symptoms. Thesymptoms include lumps which contain cancerous cells. Thisillustrates cancer as a process of abnormal cellular growth causedby an underlying dysfunctional state of the body's internal terrain inthe majority of cases. Cancer is simply not a lump or mass that \"justcomes on\" without any reason. Julian Whitaker, MD, noted alternative cancer expert, sums up his view of cancer this way: I look upon cancer in the same way that I look upon heart disease, arthritis, high blood pressure, or even obesity, for thatmatter, in that by dramatically strengthening the body's immunesystem through diet, nutritional supplements, and exercise,the body can rid itself of the cancer, just as it does in otherdegenerative diseases. Consequently, I wouldn't havechemotherapy and radiation because I'm not interested intherapies that cripple the immune system, and, in my opinion,virtually ensure failure for the majority of cancer patients. Although advance technology and science have stretched man's life expectancy from 42 to 76 years over the last century, more andmore people are still getting cancer. In fact, one in three adults willdie of cancer. The lifetime chance of getting cancer of the colon isMy Doctor is Killing Me!40Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 6%, the prostate 17%, the breast 14%, and the lung 7%. There is evidence that we can reduce the incidence of cancer of the colon byup to 50%, the prostate by 15% and the lung by 90%. That means,we can actually reduce our probability of getting cancer if we reallywant to! The good news is that cancer is no longer the death warrant it used to be if you detect and heal it early. Like other diseases such asheart disease and diabetes, the majority of cancers that afflict adultscan be viewed as an age-related degenerative disease in conceptualterms. This will help us understand the many facets of cancerpathology and why it can be overcome naturally, just like diabetesand atherosclerosis. Today, advance medical science and technologyhave made it possible for many of these chronic degenerativediseases to be cured if treatment begins early with the correct andappropriate approach. CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES - HITTING A PLATEAU Over the past half a century, there have been rapid improvements intechnology and medical science. One would expect medicaltreatments and success rates for cancer to improve steadily. Buthave they? The answer is an emphatic no. Since 1950, the overallcancer incidence has increased by 44%, with breast cancer andmale colon cancer up by 60% and prostate cancer up by 100%.44% of Americans living today are expected to develop cancer. Fordecades, the 5-year survival rate has remained constant for non-localized breast cancer at 18% and lung cancer at 13%. Groupedtogether, the average cancer patient has a 50/50 chance of livinganother five years, which are the same odds he or she had in 1971. Depending on which expert you talk to, the war on cancer declared by President Richard Nixon on Dec 23, 1971 has at best been\"progressing slowly\", and at worse, a \"dismal failure\" considering41the 45 billion dollars spent over the past few decades on cancer research. While the National Cancer Institute (NCI) claims that the5-year survival rate (the accepted definition of a \"cure\") has increasedfrom 20% of cancer patients in 1930 to 53% of adults and 70% ofchildren today, critics of the NCI claim that living five years aftercancer diagnosis has more to do with earlier diagnosis alone thanthe therapeutic modalities used. Let us first take a look on the three accepted conventional cancer treatments - surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Surgery (Cut) Surgery is the most successful conventional treatment. It is very effective in removing localized tumors. If the cancer has spread toother parts of the body, it is far less successful. Debulking by surgicalmeans is also very effective in treating life-threatening and advance-stage cancers. So we see that surgery can be a useful therapy in some cancers. However, it is seldom necessary in prostate cancer. In breast cancer,a good surgical excision can cure it when combined with non-toxicnatural therapies together with detoxification and/or drugs. Chemotherapy (Poison) Drugs used in chemotherapy were derived from mustard gasexperiments during World War I and II. There is no doubt thatcancer cells are easily destroyed during chemotherapy. Unfortunately,cancer cells rely on processes that are similar to those used by normal cells. The difference between cancer cells and normal cells lies intheir activities and not in their functions. Hence, chemotherapy givesrise to complications as normal cells that exist alongside the cancertissues are also damaged during the process.My Doctor is Killing Me!42Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Another negative side effect is that many chemotherapy drugs have mutagenic properties that cause abnormal changes in DNA. If thepatient is pregnant, it may affect the fetus or embryo, leading to birthdefects. Some drugs also cause localized skin irritations. It is a sadfact that many patients often die from these side effects or from thedrugs themselves due to their high toxicity. In a survey conducted, 73% of doctors said they would never opt for chemotherapy due to its high toxicity and ineffectivenessif they were inflicted with cancer. This alone tells you how toxic chemotherapy is. Chemotherapy is so dangerously toxic that it is best avoided in the treatment of most types of cancers. It should only be used when it is proven to be effective and curative, such as for testicular cancer,many children's tumor, and extreme cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bear in mind that despite the extensive damage done to the body, chemotherapy can only benefit a small number of epithelial cell cancers such as cancer of the breast, lungs, prostate, and colon. It can eradicate only about 7% of all human cancers. It looks like optingfor chemotherapy may give a cancer patient more liabilities thanassets. In some cases, chemotherapy can perhaps prolong life for another 15% of patients, after which the natural progression of the disease will lead to death. Statistics show that chemotherapy is not very effective in the treatment of about 80% of malignant tumors.This is very discouraging. There is a need to climb beyond the currentcure plateau by trying new approaches. If the proven success rates of chemotherapy are so poor, then why do so many people still opt for it? The reason is due to the lack ofalternative approaches that are approved by the FDA (Food andDrug Administration). The FDA is supposed to be the watchdog of43our nations' health. Unfortunately, when it comes to alternative cancer therapy, it is years behind other countries in Western Europe. Muchof this has to do with the politics of cancer and its beneficiary, thepharmaceutical industry. This is a quote from Ralph Moss, PhD, author of The Cancer Industry which perhaps sums up the situation succinctly: If you can shrink the tumor 50% or more for 28 days you have got the FDA's definition of an active drug. That is called aresponse rate, so you have a response...(but) when you lookto see if there is any life prolongation from taking this treatmentwhat you find is all kinds of hocus pocus and song and danceabout the disease free survival, and this and that. In the endthere is no proof that chemotherapy in the vast majority ofcases actually extends life, and this is the GREAT LIE aboutchemotherapy, that somehow there is a correlation betweenshrinking a tumor and extending the life of the patient. The inescapable fact is that chemotherapeutic agents are toxic and can cause a great deal of collateral damage to the body. It lowers the person's natural resistance to diseases as it suppressesthe immune system. In addition, the toxic nature of the treatment isfeared almost as much as the cancer itself. Whether the patientsurvives long after that is a gamble. In a research study by Dr Ulrich Abel, he concluded that strong and aggressive chemotherapy actually shortens the lives of cancerpatients when compared with patients where chemotherapy is eitherdelayed or administered in a lower dosage. He also noted that thetemporary shrinking of a tumor growth may not be necessarily agood sign as the remaining cancer cells often become more resistantand multiply more quickly.My Doctor is Killing Me!44Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Radiation Therapy (Burn) The final option, radiation treatment, has similar side effects as chemotherapy. The radiation's effective use in palliative treatmentfor selected cancers cannot be doubted, but generally speaking,radiation treatment should only be administered veryselectively. In the case of breast cancer, for example, radiation treatment has been shown to reduce death by 13.2%. However, theincrease in deaths from other causes, mostly heart disease, goesup by 21.2%. In other words, \"The treatment was a success but thepatient died\". Although radiation therapy is less painful, people very seldom choose this as the first line of defense because of the unknowns. It is chosenprimarily in later-stage cancers where it is used to shrink the tumorsencroaching or impinging on vital parts of the body. Another drawback about this therapy is that there is a certain limit to the radiation that a patient can tolerate. Once a person has beenexposed to that lifetime limit, that's it. They cannot take any morebeyond this limit. Otherwise, they may die from radiation poisoning.Thus, the exposure to radiation is said to have a cumulative effect. So is today's conventional cancer treatment of surgery, chemotherapy and radiological therapy the ideal solution? The answer must be\"no\". Side Effects The list of side effects that accompany conventional cancer treatmentis indeed scary. They include: Bone marrow suppression Reactivation of viral diseases such as herpes W eakness45Kidney damage Peripheral nerve injury Anemia Heart muscle damage Toxic overload Diarrhea Hair loss Worse yet, the success rate, as alluded to above, has remained the same in 30 years. Clearly, something is wrong with conventionaltherapy. The foundational philosophy of allopathic medical systemis that most diseases have a single and definable causative enemythat can be surgically removed or blasted into submission withchemo- and radiation therapy. In a small number of cases, this hasbeen proven correct. In the vast majority of cancers, however, thethree tools we have developed are simply not enough to eradicatecancer cells. We have spent more than half a century focusing all our energies on these three areas and ridiculed any new ideas, and the resultsspeak for themselves. No wonder patients are disillusioned with thecurrent system. Statistics show that over 40% of all cancer patientsare seeking alternative treatments, and for good reasons. They aretaking their health into their own hands because they have lost faithin their doctor. A cancer toolbox containing only three tools is far from complete. We need a toolbox with hundreds of tools we can pick and choose from to get the job done. The tools of chemotherapy, surgery, andradiation are simply insufficient. There are many alternative cancertherapies that are valuable assets in cancer treatment. There is no\"magic bullet\", and none should be expected. What are available,however, are sound natural non-toxic therapies that have beenaround for centuries but that have been suppressed and ignored byMy Doctor is Killing Me!46Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine the medical community for the past 100 years. It's time we take a second look at these natural therapies. WAR ON CANCER - WHO IS WINNING? Given the limited tools we have to fight cancer, is there any surprisethat we are losing the war on cancer? If you are still not convincedthat the battle was lost long ago, here are some more facts youshould know. From 1973 to 1987, melanoma increased by 83%, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by 51%, 32%. The 30-year trend (1960-62 to 1990-92) for death from lung cancer is up 85% for men and up438% for women, up 29% for prostate cancer, up 4% for breastcancer, up 12% for female pancreatic cancer. The rate of death fromsome cancers has dropped over the same period: colon and rectumcancers, -9%, male leukemia, -9%, and cancer of the ovary, -8%.Overall, the cancer death rate, after adjusting for changes in thesize and composition of the population with respect to age, went upby 7% between 1975 and 1990. Clearly, conventional medicine hasfailed in its \"war on cancer\". Spokesman for conventional care frequently cite the 5-year survival rate as indicative of progress and money wisely spent. In reality, thisnumber is very misleading as can be seen upon close scrutiny. Between 1974-76 and 1981-87, the 5-year survival rates only rose 2%, from 49% to 51% overall. For cancers of the liver, lung, pancreas,bone, and breast, 5-year survival rates are about the same as theywere in 1965. Due to advances in diagnostic modalities, survival time is now longer than in the past but this is more because ofearlier diagnosis than more successful treatment. For example, consider a woman whose breast cancer is diagnosed three yearsearlier because of mammography. This woman may live for sevenyears. In 1985, using older diagnostic and treatment tools, this same47woman would have appeared to live only four years. The sad reality is that we have improved on screening tools, but not curing tools.The perceived \"success\" has only occurred on paper. Let us look at some additional hard statistics on common cancers. The approximate 5-year survival rate (all stages) using conventionaltreatment for bladder cancer is 80.7%, 75% for breast cancer, 61%for colorectal cancer, 57% for kidney cancer, 68% for cancer, 86% for melanoma, ovarian for pancreatic cancer, 85%for prostate cancer, and 68% for uterine cancer. Based on theseyou may feel pretty good, assuming that after five years, your chancesof survival are the same based on a straight-line projection goingforward. If one takes a longer view, the numbers become scarier. For example, the overall 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is about 75%, butthe extended survival rate (beyond 5 years) is less then 50%. Forprostate cancer, the picture is not much brighter, with 10-year survivalonly around 35%. A 5-year window and definition of \"cure\" is notlong enough. With the aging population, a 10-year time frame ismore appropriate. Was there cancer on the face of this world before the advent of modern medicine? Of course there was. How did people treat cancerfor the past 5,000 years of human history? Did they simply lay thereand die? Of course not. Through the centuries, natural therapieswere available and had been used by emperors and kings alike tocombat cancer. Unfortunately, their use have all but been suppressedthe past century and labeled \"quackery\" by modern medicine. Hereis what a respected alternative cancer specialist has to say: We know that conventional therapy doesn't work - if it did, you would not fear cancer any more than you fearMy Doctor is Killing Me!48Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine pneumonia. It is the utter lack of certainty as to the outcome of conventional treatment that virtually screams for morefreedom of choice in the area of cancer therapy. Yet most so-called alternative therapies regardless of potential or provenbenefit, are outlawed, which forces patients to submit to thefailures we know don't work, because there is noother choice. ...I'd turn my back on 50 years of institutionalized expertise,because it follows the wrong paradigm. Everything that is donein medicine today or in any other discipline fits some paradigm.The paradigm I use for cancer is that it is a systemic problemin which the normal control mechanisms of your body arealtered. Your immune system likely bears the largest burdenfor this control; thus, all techniques that enhance it arepromising. Those that damage it are not. \u2014 Julian Whitaker, MD NATURAL VS. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE The power of natural medicine or therapies to treat cancer has been used for centuries by millions, much longer than drugs whichonly came on the scene some 150 years ago. Its use had oftenbeen underestimated. Today, we know that many of these naturalcompounds are truly amazing fellows - they are of differentstructures, sizes, colors and tastes but each contains a nutritionnugget with specific anti-cancer properties. Most natural compounds used for treating cancer are relatively non-toxic . From laboratory test, we know that their toxicity ranges from 21- to 270-fold less toxic when compared with toxicchemotherapy drugs. Side effects are much less and usually haveto do with discomfort, if any, rather than potentially life-threateningoutcomes.49Conventional therapy attempts to remove the tumor in cancer patients as much as possible. These highly toxic treatments are of coursenecessary and life saving at times. But, the bad thing is that theyweaken the patient, depleting the body's nutritional reserves anddestroying the patient's immunity system at a time when it is neededmost. Natural compounds, on the other hand, boost the body's immunity so that it can fight the cancerous cells. Cancer cells need to be attacked from many levels. A shotgun approach is needed, as we have yet to develop the magic bullet. In addition to focusing on the local lesion with conventional therapy, thecomprehensive cancer program needs to consider adjustment ofthe dysfunctional internal terrain as an integral part of the treatmentplan. This is where natural therapies come into play. Natural therapies are what will be discussed further in this book. Combining the best of drug based and natural based medicinerepresents the best one-two punch to beat cancer. NUTRITIONAL MEDICINE Food-based nutritional supplementation prescribed by naturalmedicine physicians to cure disease is as old as the history ofmankind itself. As a medical sub-specialty within the system ofmedicine, its advent was made possible only in the mid-1980s. Priorto that, we simply did not have the sophisticated technology toaccurately measure, at the cellular level, the impact of naturalsubstances and their effects. The modern era of life sciences, stemcell and genetic research brings with it tools that allow researcherstoday to measure the amount of oxidative stress, free radicalpathology, genetic damage, and mitochondrial function of the cellpreviously not possible. This is a new science of cellular medicinethat was born out of technology. The basis of natural medicine is the use of food-based nutrition and other non-toxic natural compounds and modalities to optimize cellularMy Doctor is Killing Me!50Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine function. They correct dysfunctional cellular states such as mutational changes characteristic of cancer. Unfortunately, most doctors are seldom taught about nutrition during their long medical training to make them comfortable with the use ofnutrition as a therapeutic tool. Jean Mayer, a well-known nutritionist,made this humorous comment, \"Do you know that the average doctor knows only a little more about nutrition than the averagesecretary? If the secretary has a weight problem, she willprobably know more than the average doctor!\" Out of the 125 medical schools in the United States, only a small percentage require coursework in nutrition. Furthermore, thiscoursework only comprises just a few hours of lectures on nutritionduring their entire training. This is definitely not enough to cultivatea thorough understanding of the relationship between nutrition andhealth and certainly not enough to qualify the average physician asan expert in this field. The topic of nutrition is very important in the diagnosis and treatment of many sub-clinical disease states including cancer. But due to thedoctor's lack of education and understanding on this topic, they oftendo not include this as an effective method of treating and preventingdiseases. The use of nutrition as a therapeutic tool in the cancersetting is called orthomolecular oncology. A complete cancertreatment program should include such a component. The reason issimple: 40% of cancer patients do not die from cancer itself. They die from malnutrition. Also 67% cancer patients die froma severely depressed immunity system often resulting fromaggressive chemotherapy treatments. In both cases, death can actually be prevented or delayed with optimum nutritionalbalance.51If only these doctors are better versed in nutrition, more lives can be saved. Till today, believe it or not, many of the top doctors know littleabout nutrition. How can this be true? Well, here are some of thereasons: 1. They have not been taught nutrition in medical school. They are discouraged from practicing this in the clinical setting as it isclassified as non-traditional. 2. They do not have the time. They are too busy in their practice to keep abreast with the latest developments in nutritional andnatural medicine. 3. They do not have control over the kind of treatment offered to patients. Very often, insurance companies dictate to them.Doctors have to prescribe from a list of approved medication.Natural medicine and herbal remedies are not included inthis list. 4. Doctors are afraid to stand out from their peers and be criticized. They usually follow their guidelines strictly. 5. Doctors are generally not flexible. They are conservative and resistant to new changes. It is wrong to assert that mainstream medicine and conventional cancer therapies are out of fashion and not effective altogether. Thereis no doubt that these traditional methods can save lives at times.Highly trained doctors have been able to manage acute illnessthrough these conventional methods and they have done well intreating the patients. On this note, proper credit should be given. To look at it in a different light, you cannot blame your doctor for not offering you alternative therapies either. Chances are not only doeshe lack the knowledge, but he is also bound by strict medical societyrules to stick to conventional protocols. Failure to do so constitutessub-standard care and even malpractice. Do you then expect yourMy Doctor is Killing Me!52Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine doctor to sacrifice his whole life and career for your sake? Like you, he is the victim of the circumstances. The issue is certainly complex, and according to Samuel Epstein, MD, \"We are not dealing with a scientific problem. We are dealingwith a political issue.\" ON THE RIGHT TRACK To successfully treat cancer patients, your doctor must be a generalist and examine in detail the underlying factors that cause the cancer.He must understand fully not only the physiology of the symptoms,but also look into the nutrition and diet, the physical and emotionalwell-being of the patient. The doctor therefore should be well versedin conventional treatment options as well as scientifically basednatural modalities. To successfully overcome cancer, the patient must understand that he is embarking on an intensive healing process to reverse or slow down a condition that has accumulated from many yearsof toxic buildup and dysfunction. Those who embark on the program early have better chances of recovery. To successfully chart out a cancer treatment protocol, the patient and doctor must work together to integrate both conventional andnatural therapies. We quote here some reassuring words: The combination of nutritional therapy plus standard approach is a highly promising comprehensive approach to cancertreatment. Patients who follow this combined approach for at53least 2 months have a significantly better outcome than patients on standard therapy alone. \u2014 Abram Hoffer, MD, PhD, author of over 500 medical articles, and nine books, including Smart Nutrients , Vitamin C and Cancer, and Orthomolecular Medicine for Physicians, and an alternative cancer physician of over 770 patients . IS YOUR DOCTOR KILLING YOU? Doctors are trained as humanitarians. There is no intention to commit any harm of course. They spend years in training for the purpose ofsaving lives the best that they can. In the case of cancer therapy,however, their best is simply not good enough because the treatmentforms have been misguided. The fact is that millions of innocent cancer patients have died under the watchful eyes of conventional cancer therapy in the past 30 years.Surely not all of these deaths can be prevented by any medicine,conventional or otherwise. At the same time, there is little doubt thatmany lives have been lost prematurely from conventional medicine'sapproach of cut, burn, and poison. The title of this chapter probably represents the thinking of most cancer patients who have chosen the path of natural therapy, andthe conviction of many of those who have suffered unnecessarilybecause of conventional cancer therapy. Nevertheless, we mustmake it clear that No, your doctor is not killing you, at least not onpurpose! But Yes, you have options, and these options are oftennot disclosed to you. I also believe that you have a right to knowabout ALL the options, for it is your body. You are making life anddeath decisions, and your information must be complete. Only youcan decide the proper treatment program, and you can only makean informed decision after you have all the facts, not part of thefacts, or only the facts that doctors like you to know.My Doctor is Killing Me!54Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine The good news is that more and more doctors now have an open mind and are starting to offer natural non-toxic therapies to cancerpatients as adjunct treatment options to complement theirconventional protocols. We are indeed embarking on a new era ofhealing, combining the best of conventional and natural therapy inour quest to beat cancer. Now let us learn what cancer is from the latest break-through in science, and how natural medicine fits into the picture.55/fl1rt\"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.\" Albert EinsteinCHAPTER TWO WHY ME? 56Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Believe it or not, we know a lot more about why we get cancer than you think. Only by knowing the reasons can we start to beat it. If you have cancer, or know someone who has, this chapter will help you identify some of the risk factors, or even pinpoint the reasons why cancer attacks some while sparing others. Before wedo that, let us make sure we are speaking the same language and have a common reference point. TYPES OF CANCERS According to conventional allopathic medicine there are over 150 types of cancers that can be categorized as follows: 1. Lung, breast, prostate, skin, stomach, and colon cancers are called carcinomas and are characterized by solid tumors. 2. Sarcomas are cancers that form in the bone and the soft tissues surrounding organs. They are solids and are the most rare anddeadly forms of malignant tumors. 3. Leukemia forms in the blood and the bone marrow. These are non-solid tumors and are characterized by abnormal productionof white blood cells. 4. Lymphomas are cancers of the lymph nodes. They are divided into two categories, Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's. 5. Myelomas are rare tumors that form in the antibodies producing plasma cells in various tissues. Cancer Staging Depending on the type of cancer and the severity of it on diagnosis, conventional treatment options will vary according to howadvance the cancer process is. Fortunately, conventional doctors have devised a \"staging\" system for each cancer for easy reference. All physicians, natural or conventional, need this common57reference system before they can start helping you. If you have cancer, it is of paramount importance that you ask your conventionaldoctor the following: The Medical Name of Your Cancer. You will need the full medical name in order to research accurately the cancer. The Stage of Your Cancer. This describes how far cancer has spread. It is usually from stage I to IV, and often followed by \"A\"or \"B\" to further delineate the severity within each stage. Ingeneral, stage I cancers are small localized cancers that areusually curable, while stage IV usually represents inoperable ormetastatic cancer. Stage II and III cancers are usually locallyadvanced and/or with involvement of local lymph nodes. It isimportant to note that the staging system is different for eachkind of cancer. For solid tumors, stages I-IV are actually definedin terms of a more detailed staging system called the \"TNM\"system. In the TNM system, TNM stands for Tumor, Nodes, andMetastases. Each of these is separately classified with a numberto give the total stage. For example, a T2N1M0 cancer meansthe patient has a T2 tumor, N1 lymph node involvement, and nodistant metastases. Again, the definitions of T, N and M arespecific to each cancer. Possibly the Grade of Your Cancer. Tumor grade refers to a measure of how abnormal the cells in your tumor are whenexamined under the microscope. This can refer to the appearanceof the cells or to the percentage of cancer cells that appear to bedividing abnormally. The higher the grade, the more aggressiveand fast growing and devastating the cancer. Tumors are typicallyclassified from least to most aggressive as grade I through IV. Possibly Other Prognostic Factors. Often, there are specific molecular tests on your cancer cells that may play a significantWhy Me?58Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine role in determining treatment and prognosis. For example, breast cancer can be found to be Estrogen Receptor Positive (ER+) orNegative (ER-). ER+ cells have receptors for estrogen on theirsurface, and their growth often requires the presence of estrogen.ER+ tumors are more affected by hormonal treatment and tendto be less aggressive. Characteristics of Cancer Cells After the billions spent on research, we now know the followingcharacteristics of cancer cells. These characteristics are offundamental importance. All cancer treatments, conventional orotherwise, focus on manipulating the cell and its environment.Knowing the characteristics is therefore a key to winning thecancer war. These characteristics are:Cancer cells have greatly prolonged life spans compared to normal cells. C ancer cells fail to develop the specialized functions of their normal counterparts. Masses of cancer cells may become like parasites, developing their own network of blood vessels and siphoning off key nutrientsfrom the body. Cancer cells prefer sugar as source of energy as compared to normal cells which favor oxygen. Cancer cells are more sensitive to heat and less able to tolerate high temperature compared to normal cells. Cancer cells form a tumor, or a swelling caused by the abnormal growth if left unchecked. The tumor can invade adjacent normaltissue or spread through lymph vessels or the blood vessels toother normal tissues.59Cancer cells are usually benign and are carried by many people within their body. Such benign tumors are encapsulated by fiberand insulated from the body and from their toxins. Cancers that metastasize quickly are less mature and more aggressive. They are more malignant. An aggressive cancer hasa doubling time of 60 days or less; a moderate cancer doublesin 61-150 days, and a indolent cancer doubles in 151-300 days,and a very indolent cancer takes 300 days or more. The average size of a breast cancer when first detected by mammography is about 600 million cells, or about 0.25 inchesacross; the average size detectable by manual palpation is about45 billion cells and about 1.25 inches in diameter. Cancer cells that metastasize exhibit little to no cell-to-cell adhesion as compared to normal cells that tend to adhere toeach other to form well-defined tissues (except blood cells). HOW CANCER BECOMES LIFE-THREATENING Most cancer deaths are not caused by the direct resultof vital organ dysfunction brought on by an encroachingcancerous tumor. The majority of cancer deaths comes as a result of infection by bacteria, viruses, and fungi - microbes that normally would bedestroyed by the immune system. The cancerous body is usually severely immune-compromised because of systemic weakeningbrought on by the cancer process and partly because of the negative,toxic effects of conventional treatment - chemotherapy, surgery,and radiation. Severe malnutrition or emaciation may affect up to 90% of all advance cancer patients and account for 50% of all cancerdeaths. Cancer cells effectively use up all the body's energy reserves, leaving the body in a dire state of cellular starvation calledWhy Me?60Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine cachexia. Remember that cancer cells favor glucose as a source of fuel instead of oxygen. Protein-calorie malnutrition is commonlyassociated with undernourished children in under-developedcountries. It is not uncommon among hospitalized patients in general,leading to overall weakness, apathy, increases in mortality andsurgical failures, reduced immunity, and poor treatment response. Signs of Cancer Cancer can be beaten if you detect it early enough and treat it withnatural therapies. These methods work best when the body's tumoris relatively small. Here are some signs to look for:A lump or thickening in the breast or testicles are indicative signs for further investigation. A change in a wart or mole may be reflective of melanoma or squamous carcinoma. A persistent skin sore that does not heal may be indicative of melanoma. A change in bowel or bladder habits, such as constipation, chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal or urinary bleeding indicatinggastrointestinal cancer. A persistent cough or coughing up blood, indicating bronchial tree damage. Constant indigestion or trouble swallowing, are common signs of colon, stomach, or esophagus cancer. Unexplained weight loss, as cancer cells use up your energy source without you knowing it. Unusual bleeding or vaginal discharge may be signs of uterine, endometrial or cervical cancer. Chronic fatigue, a symptom often accompanied by rapidly progressing cancers.61Cancer is a disease process in which healthy cells stop functioning and maturing properly. Most often triggered and started because ofDNA mutation, the end result is the same. There is an acceleratedprocess of inappropriate uncontrolled cell growth - a chaotic processthat is abnormal. Cancerous cells represent the summation of thebody's response to a continuous attack on its balancing andregulatory mechanisms by over 30 known factors and countlessmore. According to Jesse Stroff, MD, noted alternative cancerspecialist, \"The tumor is not part of the human organism, but represents a rebellion of the cells against the human organism.Consequently, cancer should be considered a disease of the wholeorganism, not a disease of cells.\" On a simplistic level, cancer can be viewed as the result of a gradual systemic poisoning and weakening of the body's immune systemby a multiplicity of stress factors collectively known as carcinogens.These carcinogens, used in a broad sense here for the sake of easyunderstanding, include chemicals, electromagnetic energy, a faultydiet, free radicals, genetic disposition, toxic metal buildup, radiation,parasites, viruses, and emotional stress, just to name a few. It is thesummation of all these carcinogens and immune-suppressing agentsacting collectively on our biochemical and psychological makeupthat facilitates cancer cell development. AVOIDING THE RISKS Most cancer patients are surprised when they are first diagnosed.They know of friends and relatives who have cancer, but normallydon't think of themselves as a candidate as well. Why? After billions of dollars spent on research, we now know that cancer is not a mysterious disease that \"just happens\" locally with a lumpbut one with relatively good predictability of occurrence if keycontributing factors are identified. Contrary to popular believe, thereWhy Me?62Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine is a mountain of information on why we get cancer, why certain people are prone to getting it, while others can smoke all their life and notget cancer. First, you may wish to answer the following questions:Do you have fast food more than twice a week? Have you been leading a sedentary lifestyle for years? Are you happy? Do you eat lots of meat and chicken? Do you live near a nuclear power plant? Yes these are all relevant questions, for science has shown their relevance beyond the shadow of doubt. Gone are the days wherewe think that tobacco smoke MAY lead to cancer as the tobaccocompanies want us to believe. We now know that first and secondhand smoke causes cancer. End of story. Understanding why cancer happens to some and not others is critical. There are reasons, and if you only look hard, chances are thatyou will find some, if not all the reasons. You just have to look hardenough. Many interdependent factors - at least 30 and growing - in various combinations contribute to the development of cancer. Althoughsome cancers have a strong genetic predisposition, and others maybe linked to an infectious process; many environmental andpsychological factors also come into play. 16 REASONS WHY YOU GET CANCER Let us look at 16 major proven cancer risk factors that we know oftoday. The more of these risk factors you are exposed to, the higheryour risk. It is never too late to reduce your risk because the toxic63effect of carcinogens is cumulative. If you already have been diagnosed with cancer, it is critical that you reduce these factors asquickly as possible to prevent further damage. 1. SunlightSolar radiation is responsible for over 400,000 skin cancers a year in the US alone. In particular, ultraviolet-B and C radiations are mostdamaging. Scientists believe that the ultraviolet component ofsunlight induces permanent mutational damage to the DNA of skincells, affecting a single gene called the p53 tumor suppressor gene.With the depletion of the protective ozone layer more ultravioletradiation is present than ever before. Three main types of skincancers are involved: melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, andbasal cell carcinoma. Risk Reduction Refraining from excessive exposure to direct sunlight. Apply sunscreens if you are exposed. But don't forget that 30-45 minutes of exposure to sunshine per week is needed foroptimum health. 2. Chronic Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs)Electromagnetic fields are energy fields that in turn have a magnetic effect on their surroundings. They are produced by various sourcesone of which is electricity. EMFs are part of nature and are radiatedby the human body and its organs too. They are also generated byman-made devices such as computer terminals, microwave ovens,overhead lights, electrical poles, and motors, just to name a few.Food mixers, hair dryers, and vacuum cleaners emit EMFs that are30 to 100 times greater than the suggested safe limit. In fact, ordinaryhousehold appliances such as cellular phones, television sets, andelectrical outlets tend to generate larger cumulative EMF exposuresthan power lines because most people are much nearer to theseWhy Me?64Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine appliances. Although EMFs from appliances drop off at a distance of about 16 feet, people often stand or sit closer than this to thesource in the case of household appliances. EMFs interact with livingsystems, affecting enzymes related to hormonal metabolism, celldivision, and gene expression. The frequency of the EMF determinesits potency and harmful potential. The frequency of the electric currentused in homes in the US is 60 Hz (hertz or cycles per second). Incontrast, the ideal frequency of the human brain during waking hoursranges from 8 to 20 Hz, while in sleep, the frequencies may drop toas low as 2 Hz. It is postulated that higher frequencies may disturbthe brains' natural resonant frequencies, leading to cellular fatigueand activation of oncogenes. Studies have shown that children livingin proximity to large power lines have twice the risk for all cancers,2.5 times the risk for brain cancer, and three times the risk forleukemia, and the incidence is directly proportional to the amount oftime spent exposed to EMF. Among adults, there is a strong association between EMFs and brain cancer, and, to a lessextent, breast cancer. We do know that melatonin production is reduced in those afflicted with breast cancer, and excessive exposureto weak EMF can disturb the brain's production of melatonin. In fact,a University of North Carolina research team has shown that femaleelectrical workers were 40% more likely to die from breast cancerthan women in other occupations. Risk Reduction Stay away from EMF as much as possible. Remove electrical appliances from your bedroom, including electricalarm clocks. Do not use electric blankets, and sleep in a roomwithout a night light. From the workplace or home, get a gauss meterand measure the amount of EMF exposure. Upgrade your electricalcircuitry if needed to reduce EMF exposure. Do not use microwaveovens, and stay at least 12 feet away from a TV screen.653. Ionizing Radiation Ionizing radiation, such as X-rays, consists of high-energy rays that can disrupt the electron from matter, causing genetic mutations thatcan lead to cancer. Radiologists have historically a higher incidenceof cancer, as have other workers exposed to low-dose radiation. X-rays (or gamma rays) also emanate from fluorescent lights, computermonitors, and television screens. Medical X-rays may be responsible for many breast cancers, according to estimates by John Gofman, MD, PhD, professoremeritus in the department of Molecular and Cell Biology at theUniversity of California at Berkeley. Dr Gofman felt that all kinds ofcancer can be induced by radiation, with its effect often felt onlydecades after the initial exposure. The longer the radiation exposure,the smaller the dose needed to do damage. He announced that theofficial estimates on cancer risk of radiation exposure had beenunderestimated by 10 times. These estimates threatened the nuclearpower industry, and Dr Gofman was dismissed from his job. Thekey to preventing cancer, according to Dr Gofman, is elimination ofhigh dose of breast irradiation, including mammogram. Risk Reduction Avoid X-rays or mammograms unless necessary. 4. Pesticide/Herbicide ResiduesThe widespread use of pesticide is staggering. Ten times as much pesticides are used today compared to 50 years ago. Over 400pesticides are currently licensed for use on America's food sources.Over 1.2 billion pounds were dumped on crops, land, forests, lawns,and fields. Over 35,000 different formulations of pesticides have comeinto use over the past five decades worldwide. Some are banned(such as DDT), but many of these eventually find their way todeveloping countries where they enter the food chain and eventuallyfind their way back to the US as coffee, fruits, and vegetables.Why Me?66Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine In addition to foods, pesticides are used in building materials (wood preservatives), food containers, golf courses, and parks, just to namea few. Pesticides also leach into the water supply. Many cancer-causing pesticides and industrial chemicals accumulate in fattytissues of fish, cattle, and poultry. This process of bioaccumulationaffects the brain, sexual organs, and breasts because these areorgans with the highest concentration of fatty tissue. Unfortunately,less than 1% of all foods are being tested for pesticide residues.There is essentially no escape. The evidence is clear that pesticides cause cancer among farmers and agricultural workers at high doses, including non-Hodgkin'slymphoma. Israel is one of the first countries to ban many toxicchemicals such as DDT and PCBs. In the 10 years since the ban,the rate of breast cancer deaths has declined sharply, with a mortalityrate reduction of 30% in women under 44 years old. Pesticides usedin the home and garden have been linked to a variety of cancers,including childhood leukemia and brain cancer. A study done in 1973 by the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem analyzed some tumor samples. The researchersfound that when cancerous breast tissue was compared with non-cancerous tissue from elsewhere in the same woman's body, theconcentration of toxic chemicals such as DDT and PCBs was \"muchincreased in the malignant tissue compared to the normal breastand adjacent adipose [fat] tissue.\" Following a public outcry, Israelbanned these chemicals from being used on feed for dairy and meatcattle. Over the next 10 years, the rate of breast cancer deaths inIsrael declined sharply, with a 30% drop in mortality for women under44 years of age, and an 8% overall decline. At the same time, allother known cancer risks -alcohol consumption, fat intake, lack offruits and vegetables in the diet - increased significantly. During thisperiod, worldwide death rates from cancer increased by 4%.67The only answer scientists could find to explain this was the reduced level of carcinogenic environmental toxins. Risk Reduction Eat certified organically grown whole food. 5. Industrial ToxinsHighly toxic chemicals and heavy metals used in industries often find their way into our body. Such compounds include lead (fromcigarette smoke, ceramic glazes on cooking utensils, cannedfood), mercury (from dental fillings, fish) aluminium (fromantacids, over-the-counter drugs and douches), nickel andcadmium (from cigarettes, instant coffee and teas, nickel-cadmium batteries). They have a tendency to accumulate in the fat cells, affecting the central nervous system, brain, and glands. Many environmental chemicals mimic the activity of estrogen once inside the body due to their close resemblance in chemicalstructure to estrogen; for this reason, they are also calledxenoestrogens. They are now believed to contribute to the risingincidence of breast cancer and its epidemic worldwide. Toxins alsobecome synergistically more toxic when combined. For example,combining the normally weak environmental estrogens such asdieldrin and endosulfan results in a compound that is 1,000 timesmore potent. The National Academy of Science tells us that the average American ingests 40 mg of pesticides alone and carries about one-tenth of agram permanently stored in body fat. The average American,regardless of place of residence, is expected to have over 250chemical contaminants in the body that is verifiable by blood tests. Risk Reduction Avoid smoke filled environments; avoid fresh and coastal water fish. Remove any mercury fillings; avoid antacids. Use organic shampoos and toothpastes.Why Me?68Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 6. Polluted, Chlorinated and Fluoridated Water According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the tap water of 30 million Americans contains potentially hazardous levels of lead.One out of every four public water systems has violated Federalstandards for tap water. The contaminants include bacteria,radioactive particles, heavy metals, chemical residues, and industrialwastes. Ground water also contains toxic amounts of radionuclidesthat can cause cancer. Chlorinated water consumption is linked with a 20-40% increase in the incidence of colon and rectal cancer. In a study conducted byHarvard University and the Medical College of Wisconsin, theconsumption of chlorinated drinking water accounts for 15% of allrectal cancers and 9% of all bladder cancers in America. The risk ofgetting rectal cancer is increased by 38% and bladder cancer by21% for people drinking chlorinated water. Fluoridated water, touted as the best way to reduce dental cavity, has been associated with a six times increase in bone cancer inmales under age 20. As little as 1 ppm (parts per million) of fluoridein water was found to increase the tumor growth rate in mice by25%. The incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancer rises withincreased exposure to fluoride by as much as 50% accordingly to astudy conducted by the National Cancer Institute. The legal limit inthe US is 4 ppm. Fluoridated water has been outlawed in mostEuropean countries, with no resultant increase in dental decay. Risk Reduction Avoid tap water. Drink only pure filtered water. 7. TobaccoOver 2,000 chemical compounds are generated by tobacco smoke, many of them poisonous. Over 350,000 deaths occur each year in69the US as a result of tobacco use, and 33% of these deaths occur from smoking-related lung cancer alone. In fact, lung cancer can bereduced by 90% if smoking is prohibited. Second hand smokecontains dangerous carcinogens as well, including benzene, radon,and asbestos. It is estimated that 20% of lung cancers are causedby second hand smoke. Smoking increases harmful free radicalsand lower our immune system by suppressing the natural killer (NK)cells and IgA (Immunoglobulin A) antibodies. Tar, formed whenorganic compound is burned, is a leading cancer-causing compoundfound in tobacco. It contains highly toxic hydrocarbons and someradioactive compounds like potassium-40 as well. These substanceshave been shown on a cellular basis to damage a tumor suppressorgene called p53 in lung cells, resulting in cancer. Carbon monoxidereleased during smoking reduces the oxygen supply to the brain,lung and heart. Smokers also have a lower circulating level of vitaminC, an important antioxidant that mops up free radicals. Risk Reduction Stay as far away from first and second hand smoke as much as possible. Take vitamin C for its antioxidant effect against harmful free radicals of tobacco smoke. 8. Hormone TherapiesIf you study all the non-genetically linked risk factors associated with breast cancer, it is evident that almost all of them are directly orindirectly associated with an excess of the female hormone estrogenor a relative dominance of estrogen due to progesterone deficiency. For example, the age at which a woman starts menstruating and the age at which she enters menopause are a proven indicator ofrisk, and these are dependent on hormone levels. A recent studyreported in the Journal of the American Medical Association showedthat women who took hormone replacement therapy (HRT) five yearsor more had an increased breast cancer risk of 1.6 to 1.85 timesWhy Me?70Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine than women who never took hormones. In the famous Harvard Nurse Study of 1976-1992, it was shown that women in the 55-59 agegroup who went on estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) for fiveyears or more had a 40% higher risk of developing breast cancer;among women aged 60-64, the risk was 70% higher. As early as the 1960s, researchers have been sounding the caution bell against the indiscriminate use of estrogen in a hormonereplacement therapy program. The average incubation time fromcellular damage to full blown cancer is about 20 years. There is verylittle doubt now that we are in the midst of a breast cancer epidemicworldwide started some 30 years ago, coinciding with the introductionof widespread estrogen use in a hormone replacement program. Similarly, studies have shown that women who started taking birth control pills under the age of 18 had a three-fold risk of developingbreast cancer. Women who took birth control pills for more than fouryears were twice as likely as non-users to develop breast cancer atage 50. Risk Reduction Unfortunately, there is no way to escape the estrogen dominant society we are in. In addition to the hormoneswe take as prescribed by our doctors, environmental estrogens suchas plastics or pesticides, enter our body. Sources range from thefood we eat to the household cleaning materials we use. There issimply no escape. To reduce your risk, use organic household supplies; take organic meat free of hormones and free rangepoultry. Balance estrogen dominance with natural progesteronecream and phytoestrogen-laced vegetables. Avoid environmental estrogens, such as pesticides, and medicines containing estrogens,such as HRT and Tamoxifen unless absolutely necessary.719. Wrong Diet and Nutrition Excessive intake of animal protein has been linked to increased risk of breast, colon, pancreatic, kidney, prostate, and endometrial cancer.Protein is broken down into nitrogenous waste that may be convertedinto carcinogenic compounds, nitrosamines and ammonium salts.Excessive protein contributes to an acidic terrain and causes a largeamount of calcium to leach from bones in an attempt to neutralizesuch an acidic environment. A chronic acidic environment eventuallyleads to the loss of calcium resulting in osteoporosis. Large studieshave been conducted showing that men who ate red meat over a 5-year period were almost three times more likely to contract advanceprostate cancer compared to men who are mainly vegetarians. Ona worldwide basis, countries with the fattiest diets also have thehighest rate of breast, colon, and prostate cancer. Smoked andpickled meat is also associated with a higher incidence of stomachand esophageal cancer. Contaminated fresh water fish should be avoided because of potential intoxication. Deep-water fishsuch as salmon, tuna, red snapper and flounder are generally safe. Excessive fat intake, especially animal fat, has been especially associated with higher rates of breast, colon, rectum, uterus, andprostate cancer. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (also calledtrans-fat) commonly found in processed food further contributes tothe problem. Most of the fatty acids that we consume from processedfood, with the exception of fish, are from the omega-6 class. Theyare also found in most plant oils such as corn and safflower oils.Excessive omega-6 fats are carcinogenic, while omega-3 fats and cold-water fish and flaxseed) are beneficial tohuman health. An excessive intake of refined carbohydrate and sugar weakens the immune system. Eating only three ounces of sugar in one sittingWhy Me?72Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine can reduce the activity of white blood cell by 40%. Sugar is also an ideal environment that cancer cells strive in. Common foods such as French fries are no better. In a recent study carried out at Stockholm University jointly with Sweden's NationalFood Administration, a government food safety agency, researchersexplained that heating of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as potatoes,rice or cereals formed acrylamide, a human carcinogen. The researchwas deemed so urgent and important that the scientists decided onthe unusual step of releasing it to the press so as to warn the generalpublic before the results were even officially published in an academicjournal. French fries sold at everyone's favorite fast-food restaurants such as Burger King and McDonald contained about 100 times the1-mcg/liter maximum permitted by the World Health Organizationfor acrylamides in drinking water. (One mg or 0.001 grams, is equivalent to 1,000 micrograms). Furthermore, an ordinary bag ofpotato chips contains up to 500 times too much acrylamide usingthese same criteria set by the WHO. This information certainly soundsvery scary. Fast-food French fries showed the highest levels of acrylamide among the foods tested by an independent agency, Center forScience in the Public Interest (CSPI). CSPI had tested and foundthat large orders contained 39 to 72 mcg. One-ounce portions ofPringles potato crisps contained about 25 mcg, whereas corn-basedFritos and Tostitos contained half that amount or less. Regular andHoney Nut Cheerios contained 6 or 7 mcg of the carcinogenicsubstance. Risk Reduction Reduce refined sugar and trans-fat intake. Supplement with optimum doses of nutritional supplements. Focuson plant-based proteins such as beans and legumes, green leafy73vegetables, and deep- and cold-water fish for its rich omega-3 content. Think twice before you reach for the potato chips, Frenchfries or other fast foods. 10. Emotional StressUnder emotional stress, an anti-inflammatory hormone called cortisol is secreted by the adrenal gland commanded by the brain. Thishormone weakens the immune system. Chronic stress leads toreduced white blood cell activities and a decreased amount oflymphocytes, causing the thymus gland to shrink. High levels ofemotional stress increase one's susceptibility to illness. Studies haveshown, for example, that the risk of developing breast cancer wasfive times higher in women who had experienced an importantemotional loss in the six years prior to the discovery of the tumor. Depression has also been linked to an increased risk of cancer. Loners are 16 times more prone to develop cancer than those whoopenly discuss their feeling according to a longitudinal study spanningthree decades. Risk Reduction Learn to let go and try meditation to reduce emotional stress. Join a cancer support group and share your worrieswith others. It is encouraging to know that studies show that cancersurvival is increased by an average of 18 months for those who areactive participants in a cancer support group. 11.Intestinal Toxicity and Digestive Impairment An adult's intestines are over 25 feet long when stretched out. Food has to pass through this system during digestion. The undigestedfood is passed out as excrement. Many believe that optimum healthbegins with a good digestive tract. A toxic bowel equals a toxicbody. Only a century ago, the average transit time from the timeWhy Me?74Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine food is ingested to the time it is excreted, was 20 hours. Today, some people have transit times of up to 72 hours. The longer foodstays in the intestinal tract, the more it putrefies, creating an idealenvironment for bacteria to flourish, leading to a myriad of diseasesincluding mal-absorption syndrome, inflammatory diseases,and cancer. Mucous-producing foods such as milk products and fowl, contribute the most to constipation. On the other hand, fruits and vegetablesbreak down the mucous leading to a faster transit time and lessconstipation. Mucous, in addition to reducing the absorption powerof the intestine, also leads to an imbalance of good and bad flora inthe gut. The result is a toxic bowel, with toxins leaching out of theintestine into other tissues. The progressive decrease in hydrochloricacid, pepsin, and pancreatic enzyme also results in poorlydigested protein, another source of toxins, not to mention thereduced production of key protein substances such as peptideneurotransmitters for optimum health due to the lack of substrateconstituents. Risk Reduction Take lots of fiber, green food, and digestive enzyme. Supplement with fiber and probiotics should be considered. 12. VirusesIt is well known that viruses can cause cancer. Human papilloma virus types 16 and 18 have been shown to cause cervical cancer.Hepatitis B virus is also linked to liver cancer. Epstein-Barr virus islinked to about 50% of cancers of the upper pharynx, 30% ofHodgkin's, and 10% of non-Hodgkin's and selected gastric cancers.It is estimated that up to 15% of cancer deaths are due to viruses,bacteria, and parasites. Risk Reduction Maintain a strong immune system with medicinal mushrooms, herbs, exercise, and a low-sugar diet.7513. Blocked Detoxification Pathway Our immune system does not have an unlimited capacity to fight carcinogens and unwanted bacteria. The body's detoxificationsystem, especially the liver, is a critical component for eliminatingtoxins and preventing illness. A blocked or sluggish detoxificationsystem increases our susceptibility to cancer. Environment andlifestyle factors can lead to the body being overloaded with metabolicby-products (such as drugs, smoke, chemical additives, and heavymetal), hormonal by-products (such as estrogen-like compoundsand growth hormone derivatives from commercial cattle and poultry),free radical by-products (such as tobacco smoke, nuclear andultraviolet radiation, and excessive exercise), and immune by-products (such as food allergies). Since the liver is a critical organ inthe detoxification process, a compromised liver is an invitationto cancer. Risk Reduction Enhance liver function with herbs such as milk thistle. 14. Cellular Oxygen DeficiencyCancer cells can live without oxygen, while normal cells cannot. The discovery of this fundamental difference has had a tremendousimpact in cancer research. Dr Otto Warburg won his first Nobel Pricein 1931 for this discovery. In fact, Dr Warburg was able to show thatwhen you put normal cells from the embryo in an environment devoidof oxygen, they will transform themselves into cancerous cellsthrough the elimination of their prime nutrient. The cell becomesdependent on the fermentation rather than oxidation of glucose forenergy. This is an adaptation in order to survive. But the fermentationprocess is highly inefficient, as a large amount of lactic acid isproduced as a by-product. Lactic acid in turn increases the acidityof the body, making it difficult for normal cells to use oxygen.Why Me?76Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Cancerous tumors may contain 10 times more lactic acid than healthy human tissues. Moreover, over the past century, the amount of oxygen we breathe in has diminished. Exposure to tobacco smoke, auto exhaust, andfactory emission, the lack of exercise, and shallow breathing all leadto a reduced oxygen supply and an increased carbon monoxideintake. If sufficient oxygen is provided, glucose fermentation stopsand normal aerobic respiration returns. Risk Reduction Moderate level of aerobic exercise is absolutely needed to keep the body well oxygenated. 15. Cellular TerrainIf you believe that the body is a closed ecosystem capable of maintaining itself in optimum function, it is logical to deduce that achange in this ecosystem (or internal terrain as some prefer to callit) affects the environment in which organisms grow or die. Factorsthat modulate the internal terrain include a proper balance of acidsand alkalis, and good and bad bacteria, among others. In additionto the Monomorphism Theory advanced by Louis Pasteur, where itis postulated that bacteria maintain one shape and invade the bodyfrom the outside causing disease, we now know that certain microbes- a bacterium, fungus, virus, or cell-wall deficient protein material -can change and take on many different shapes that are increasinglypathogenic if the internal terrain is favorable to the microbe. This iscalled the Polymorphism Theory. In other words, sickness is not somuch caused by the microbes, but rather the microbes flourish withthe sickness. These deadly agents and cancer only develop if theinternal terrain is compromised, such as when it is too acidic. If theinternal terrain is balanced, diseases cannot take place.77 Risk Reduction Avoid red meat, caffeine containing beverages such as coffee or tea, sugar and dairy foods which are acidic in nature. Focus on green leafy vegetables that are alkaline in nature.Drink pure filtered water with lemon. Maintain a balanced internalterrain with enzymes, probiotics, fibers, and green food. 16. Genetic FactorsNumerous genes with direct links to cancer have been discovered in recent years. Women with a defect of the BRCA1 tumor suppressorgene, for example, have up to a 80% higher chance of gettingbreast cancer. Numerous oncogenes have also been discovered that have the ability to transform normal cells into cancer cells. Numerous external factorsincluding aflatoxins (commonly found in peanuts), electromagneticradiation (X-rays, sunlight, nuclear radiation), viruses, and hormones,can stimulate such oncogenes. Risk Reduction Genetic testing is available and can be considered for early detection. A radical preventive approach isprophylactic mastectomy followed by breast reconstruction surgeryfor those with proven genetically positive traits. SUMMARY Most of us will find it hard to escape from most of the cancer riskfactors mentioned. Is there any surprise that the cancer rateworldwide is skyrocketing? Jesse Stoff, MD, past editor of Journal of Anthroposophic Medicine and author of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: The Hidden Epidemic, sums it up best by saying: \"The tumor is not a part of human organism, but represents a rebellion of the cells against the human organism.Why Me?78Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Cancer should be considered a disease of the whole organism, not a disease of cells.\" In the past 150 years, we have been misguided to think that cancer is a localized disease of dysfunctional cells. Inreality, cancer represents a generalized dysfunctional state with localmanifestations. The key to understanding cancer is to accept the reality that it is a multi-factorial problem and the symptom of a chronic pattern of insultsto the body's ecosystem that has gone on for decades. Cancer isnot a single cause-and-effect phenomenon at all. It is a collage ofsymptoms. This foundational understanding will lead us to formulatethe kind of natural medicine required to address each of these riskfactors and symptoms to bring homeostasis back to the body theway it is supposed to be, and ultimately, to assist the body to reversecancer naturally.79/fl1rt\"Just because data are not available does not mean an alternative treatment is ineffective, only that we don't yet know.\" Dean Ornish, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, in the book Breast Cancer - Beyond ConventionCHAPTER THREE NATURAL MEDICINE 80Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Conventional medicine really is NOT traditional at all if you look at the broader perspective from a medical history point of view. This type of medical paradigm worldwide is really a just formof \"alternative medicine\" that relies on chemicals and surgery to treatillness. Its history is only about 150 years old. It is a wonderful modelfor acute illness. It is a poor model to follow in treating chronicdegenerative diseases, including atherosclerosis and many typesof cancer. What conventional medicine calls \"alternative medicine\" is actually the true traditional medicine. Natural therapies are the most common form of medical therapy in the world today, despitethe advent of allopathic medicine. They have been used for thousands of years. They are NOT the alternative but the realmedicine suppressed for the past century but now being re-discovered in the West. Natural medicine is a system of medicine that focuses on prevention and the use of non-toxic natural therapies to restore optimum health. The natural-oriented physician addresses the patient as one inseparable unit, believing that the body and mind are interconnected.The emphasis is on elimination of underlying causes through theright diet, lifestyle, natural remedies, and preventive measures. Thenatural physician believes that caring and empathy are critical tohealing, that the physician is a partner in the healing process; andthat the patient is in charge of health-care choices. The biggest difference is that allopathic medicine tends to view good health as a physical state in which there is no obvious diseasepresent, while the natural physician recognizes true health asan optimal state of physical, mental, emotional, and spiritualwell-being. How does this relate to cancer? Let us zoom in.81CANCER ACCORDING TO NATURAL MEDICINE The person gets cancer because he's not properly metabolizing the protein in his diet. - Dr Kelley, of the famed Kelley Anti-cancer Therapy Modern oncology (the study of tumors) is founded on the Halstead Theory of Cancer developed by W.S. Halstead who lived from 1852-1922. The central premise here about cancer is that the tumor isvirtually considered the living organism and not the patient. Underthis hypothesis, the removal of a tumor should remove the diseaseand cure the patient. If this theory were true, why is it that the age-adjusted mortality rate for breast cancer has remained virtuallyunchanged for the past 50 years despite advances in surgicaltechniques and aggressive cancer debulking operations? Halstead'stheory is flawed because it emphasizes the tumor and ignores thepatient. He looked at the tumor as the disease in and of itself,disregarding the overall body as the contributing factor. Thishypothesis is clearly wrong. While conventional medicine primarily treats cancer as a focal disease with localized symptoms, natural-oriented physicians thinkotherwise. Natural-oriented physicians think of the body as a closedinternal ecosystem, and believes that it is the dysfunction of thisecosystem that is primarily responsible for the development of cancer. No treatment, conventional or otherwise, can completely eliminate all cancer cells according to natural medicine. The reason is simple.Cancer is a systemic disease, and there are simply too manycancerous or pro-cancerous cells within the ecosystem of the body.Cancer is not a localized problem but a whole-body phenomenon ofmetastatic growth. Its growth process is affected by biologicalconditions. Non-genetically-based cancer forms in the body becauseof toxins, the lack of oxygen, poor nutrition, and other factors suchNatural Medicine82Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine as hormonal imbalance. Whether the cancer in our body continues to multiply depends to a large degree on our body's biological terrain.It is this terrain that determines how the cancer is expressed. Natural-oriented doctors view cancer as a chronic, systemic and metabolic dysfunction of the intracellular genetic makeup. Tumorsare only the symptoms of the sub-microscopic dysfunctional causes. The natural medicine therefore fights cancer by optimizing the internal terrain and enabling the patient's internal system to destroy the tumor.It enhances the patient's health so that cancer cells cannot growand multiply. Now let us look at an example of how breast cancer is treated differently by conventional and natural medicine. Conventionaldoctors focus on the breast tissue itself. He will recommend thepatient to undergo surgery, chemotherapy, or radiological therapydirected at the breast mass. A natural-oriented physician will look atbreast cancer as a symptom of underlying hormonal imbalance andwill attempt to rid the cancer by rebalancing the hormonal system.The most ideal treatment for the patient will be to integrate bothconventional and natural medicine to remove the growth andunderlying imbalance of hormones. Basis of Natural Medicine Non-toxic therapies used in natural medicine have been proven toprevent cancer metastases. They can be used as an adjunct to andsometimes even as a better replacement for conventional therapiesbecause they are not toxic and do not have any significantundesirable side effects. Now, let us take a closer look at the sciencebehind some of these natural therapies.83As we have seen earlier, cancer cells have characteristics that are different from normal cells. They thrive in high-sugar and acidicenvironments and are killed at a temperature of 43 \u00b0C. They are inefficient generators of energy. Instead of using oxygen to oxidizeglucose as the primary fuel source and putting out carbon dioxideas normal cells do, they prefer to ferment sugar as a source of energyand produce lactic acid as waste. Non-toxic natural therapies focuson overcoming cancer by helping the body create an internalenvironment that is unfavorable to cancer cell function. There are thousands of natural therapies used to treat cancer. How do you know which one is good? Modern day science dictates thatany treatment, natural or conventional, must conform to the followingcriteria before one should embark on it. Otherwise, it is betterclassified as \"quackery\". 1. There must be science to justify its use objectively. 2. Some form of mechanism of action must be known.3. The therapy cannot be toxic to the body.4.The therapy should not interfere with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 5. They must be suitable for long-term therapy.6. They are active at concentrations that are achievable in humans. No amount of evidence can convince the skeptical mind. Science is an art that progresses through time. When the tomato was first discovered, the scientific community unanimously agreed that the red color was indeed a sign of toxicity. For 500 years, the tomatowas labeled a toxic food and not eaten. That was science. Similarly, the doctor who advocated that surgeons should wash their hands before going into surgery, was expelled from the hospitalfor introducing the \"unscientific\" idea at that time. That was also science.Natural Medicine84Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Let us look at some more interesting \"science\". Some 40 years ago, Dr Linus Pauling, a two time Nobel laureate postulated that takingvitamin C as a supplement could extend one's life. He was so excited that he put forth this idea to the public. Too bad, nobody believed him. The mainstream medical community ridiculed his \"cock-and-bull\" story. Nevertheless, he continued faithfully to take vitamin C on a daily basis. He passed away at the ripe age of 94 and contributed the last 18 years of his life to this supplement intake. Now, 40 yearslater, it is a widely accepted fact that free radicals cause mutational damage and is a primary cause of cancer. Vitamin C counteracts such free radicals. It took a good 30 years before the medicalcommunity started paying attention to his theory. Many more lives could have been saved if only the people had put their trust in him earlier. When does science becomes accepted? Unfortunately, science becomes science when the majority of scientists accepts it. \"Discovery is seeing what everyone saw and thinking about what no one thought\", Albert Szent-Gyoergy, Nobel laureate and discoverer of vitamin C, said. The essence of the statement is thatfew in the world would know, understand, or accept what is new.New truths go through three stages. First they are ridiculed, thenthey are violently opposed, and finally, they are accepted as being\"self-evident\". How long does it take? Anywhere from 40 to 500 years,as we have seen earlier. In the case of cancer, when we are dealingwith survival times in days and months, and few cancer patients canafford to wait more than a few weeks. Not all natural therapies are useful for cancer. They may be good for other ailments but ineffective for cancer. While embracingscientifically proven natural therapies, we must proceed with care to85weed out those natural therapies that are less sound or ineffective. Good scientists and clinicians alike focus on those therapies withthe most scientific data, knowing full well that in certain cases weonly have a \"best guess scenario\" at this infant stage of ourknowledge. Indeed, solid long-term double-blind data required bymodern science to validate some natural therapies are still decadesaway. We are in a race against time in the case of cancer, and oftentimes for humanitarian reasons, we simply do not have the time towait. The key is to at least \"do no harm\" to the patient. That much,we have a burden to uphold. At the end, the burden of proceeding with natural medicine as an adjunct to or in place of conventional therapy rests with the patientand his or her oncologist. Blessed are those who have access tosomeone knowledgeable in both areas and are able to make aninformed decision based on the latest available data. Uses of Natural Medicine The main objectives of using natural therapies are: 1. Primary prevention of cancer. This is important for those who have a strong family history of cancer. 2. Secondary prevention. More than eight million patients in the United States alone have been diagnosed with cancer wherethe cancer is now in remission. Prevention of a recurrence ofcancer is therefore the objective for this group of people. 3. To reduce the side effects resulting from conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. 4. To enhance the body's immunity system.5.In advanced stages of cancer, when conventional therapies have failed, many patients have no choice but resort toalternative treatments.Natural Medicine86Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine You don't need to have diagnosed cancer to be on a natural medicine program. You can do it for prevention of cancer. In fact, those whoare proactive or have a family history of cancer would be wise tostart an anti-aging and cancer prevention program using naturalmedicine on a prophylactic basis well ahead of any symptomsof cancer. How Natural Therapies Fight Cancer The cancer inhibitory effect of most natural compounds does notdirectly cause DNA damage, as compared to drugs. Similarly, naturalcompounds are less likely to cause DNA mutation in surviving cells.In fact, they act selectively on cancer cells without affecting normalcells most of the time. Specifically, natural compounds fight cancer by:1. Strengthening the immune system. 2.Preventing the spread of cancer cells through inhibition of angiogenesis or growth of new blood vessels feeding the cancercells. 3. Creating an environment that is unfavorable for cancer growth. The ideal environment creates a high oxygen level, highmetabolism, a high temperature, a low sugar level, and a highalkalinity environment in the body. 4. Detoxifying the body and preventing further toxic buildup in the body. 5. Supporting all targeted organs, especially those affected directly by the cancer. 6. Fighting free radicals that cause mutational changes that lead to cancer formation.87The Natural Medicine Arsenal There are literally hundreds of non-toxic natural therapies available. Some are well tested while others are purely experimental. The morecommon ones include: 1. Indictables such as and tissue extracts. 2.Oral supplementation programs such as vitamins, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, proteins, antioxidants, hormones, pro-hormones, medicinal mushrooms, traditional herbs, glandularextracts and botanicals. 3.Modalities that alter the biological terrain such as hyperthermia, frequency modulation, hyperbaric oxygen, ozone therapy, bio-magnetics, ultraviolet (UV) blood irradiation, insulin inducedchemotherapy and detoxification. 4.Psychological support such as counseling, meditation, visualization training and qigong. 5.Dietary and lifestyle adjustments such as Gerson Therapy, macrobiotic or modified macrobiotic diets, vegetarianism, stressreduction and exercise. NATURAL MEDICINE COCKTAILS It is true. Cancer patients generally have to take a handful ofnutritional supplements. It is not uncommon at all, but is it necessary?Generally speaking, moderate amounts of nutritional supplementsare needed to deliver the optimum blend of nutrients to the body.The precise blend and quantity is highly dependent on the naturalphysician's experience and the patient's condition. Putting togetherthis blend of nutrients in a cancer setting is a highly specialized fieldof study in itself. It is important to understand that natural medicineworks quite differently from drugs. Let us now look at it in more detail.Natural Medicine88Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine First, we must understand that cancer-prone events occur in our bodies in clusters. These include: Genetic instability in the nucleus Abnormal expression of genes, resulting in too few proteins that inhibit cancer and too many that facilitate it Abnormal cell-to-cell communications Induction of angiogenesis Invasion and metastasis Immune evasion Non-toxic natural compounds target these clusters of events and not any one single event. This is a task that no single compoundcan perform. Fortunately, most natural non-toxic compounds caninhibit several pro-cancer events at the same time. A largecombination of natural compounds will target these clusters and atthe same time provide a backup for other compounds. Combining natural compounds into cocktails or blends allow for synergistic interaction. When using natural compounds alone as a single agent, a larger dosage may be required. However, thismay lead to higher chances of adverse effects. Therefore, blendingthe many natural compounds into a manageable cocktail mayeliminate these direct-acting side effects and make naturalcompounds more effective at a lower and safer dosage. For thisreason, a nutritional cocktail is often required. How to Design the Cocktail Due to the large number of natural compounds available, it isimperative that a planned approach be adopted so that the patient is not overwhelmed by the sheer number of compounds thatcome in the form of powders, tablets, capsules, liquids, or evensuppositories.89Here are some parameters on how natural compounds are blended together in a cocktail: Using a large number of natural compounds with different target actions to assure redundancy and facilitate synergism. Between15-30 compounds may be used at a time. For example, use 10different antioxidants instead of a single one. Choose natural compounds that have multiple modes of action. For example, melatonin is an antioxidant as well as hormonalbalancer. To ensure diversity, choose a few within a large group of similar compounds that have the same desired effect instead of relyingon one or two. For example, coenzyme Q10 (or CoQ10) andmagnesium both increase the efficacy of the mitochondria. Useboth instead of just one or the other. Eliminate compounds that are not practical due to dosage or delivery system issues, among others. Powdered shark cartilage,for example, needs to be taken in very high dose for it to workand may not be suitable for many. The planning of an optimum blend of non-toxic natural compounds and conventional therapies is not simple, as it requires in-depthknowledge of these therapies and extensive clinical experience. Donot try to self-administer as the wrong cocktail could do more harmthan good. What is the Success Rate? The use of non-toxic natural therapies has achieved huge successover the past few decades. Extensive studies have proven them tohave an edge over conventional therapies. Some of the examplesare listed below.Natural Medicine90Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Many of the alternative cancer hospitals are found in Mexico. For example, Dr Contreras of the Oasis Hospital reported that his5-year survival rate for prostate cancer is 83% when using naturaltreatment compared to 73% for conventional treatment. In advance-stage bronchogenic carcinoma, natural therapies resulted in an improvement in the quality of life for the patients. Stage IVcancer patients said that their quality of life was better after usingthe antioxidants. The size of their tumors was reduced by half insome of the cases. Even if their tumor did not subside, the patientsfelt much better physically. At the American Metabolic Institute, renowned scientist Dr Geronimo Rubio reported success rates in reversing stage III and IV cancersfrom 65 to 75%. The reversal rate for stage I and II cancers is 80%. The famous Gerson Therapy boasted high achievements. In a study spearheaded by Gerson, 153 patients in various stages of melanomawere examined. He was proud to report that all 153 patients whounderwent the Gerson Therapy survived for five years. Only 79% ofpatients who received conventional treatment survived this lengthof time. Patients with stage IIIA melanoma who underwent GersonTherapy had a 5-year survival rate of 82% versus 39% inconventional therapy. For stage IIIB, the survival rate was 70% versus41% in conventional therapy. In stage IVA, the rate was 39% ascompared to 6%. These results are simply stunning. While the 5-year survival for end-stage cancer using conventional therapy is 9% overall, alternative cancer hospitals report that theirsis more than 30%. While 4% of terminal cancer patients show noresponse to alternative treatments, the other 96% can expect somebenefits after a month of treatment. There is therefore no turningback for patients who have bravely embarked on the path ofalternative treatments.91In another study published in Anticancer Research by Finnish researcher Jaakkola, high doses of nutritional compounds wereprescribed along with chemo- and radiation therapies for terminallyill small-cell lung cancer patients. While the 30-month survival ratefor advance lung cancer is less than 1%, Jaakkola found that 8 of 18(44%) were still alive 6 years after therapy. Dr Hoffer conducted and reported in his book, Vitamin C and Cancer , a study of 129 end-stage cancer patients who received concomitantoncology care. The control group of 31 patients who did not receivenutrition support lived an average of less than 6 months. The treatedgroup of 98 cancer patients was divided into 3 groups: 1. 19 were poor-responders. These represent 20% of the treated group. These patients survived an average of 10 months, a 75%improvement over the control group. 2. 47 were good responders. They lived an average of 6 years, a 1,200% improvement over the control group. 3.32 were good female responders. This group had hormonal imbalance cancers such as cervix, breast, ovary, and uterus.Their average lifespan was over 10 years, or a 2,100%improvement. In fact, many of them were still alive at the end ofthe study. In another study, this time by oncologists at West Virginia Medical School, 65 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladderwere given either a \"one-a-day\" vitamin supplement in accordancewith the RDA, or a mega-vitamin program consisting the same basicvitamin plus 40,000 IU of vitamin A, 100 mg of vitamin B6, 2,000 mgof vitamin C, 400 IU of vitamin E, and 90 mg of zinc. After 10 months,80% of the control group (receiving just one-a-day vitamin) hadrecurrence, while in the mega-dose group, the recurrence of tumorwas much lower at 40%. Five-year projected tumor recurrence was91% for the control group and 41% for the mega-vitamin group.Natural Medicine92Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine In other words, high-dose mega-vitamins cut the recurrence rate by almost 50%. In fact, a study of 200 cancer patients who experienced spontaneous regression showed that 87% of them made major changes indiet, most vegetarian in nature, 55% of them used some form ofdetoxification, and 65% used nutritional supplements. These are allmodalities of natural medicine. Researchers at Tulane University compared the survival rate of pancreatic cancer patients who either continued with the Westerndiet or switched to a macrobiotic whole-food diet. Pancreatic canceris one of the most deadly we know. Of the 1,467 patients tracked,only 10% were alive after one year, while 52% of those who changedtheir diets were still alive after one year. Clearly, the success rate of natural treatment, when combined with conventional therapy, is far above that of conventional cancertreatment alone. Today, many patients opt for combination therapy,using both conventional and alternative cancer treatments. Thiscombined therapy is becoming more and more popular as thesuccess rates are high. Patients in the advance stages of cancer may begin the natural therapy program as soon as the cancer is detected, if time permits.If the natural therapy is not effective, then conventional interventionshould be considered. In life-threatening cases where surgicaldebulking is required, conventional treatment should be used first,followed by natural therapy as part of the healing process.93THREE CANCER STRATEGIES 1. Treat cancer using conventional therapy alone Conventional therapy works at destroying as many cancer cells as possible. The methods used are surgery, chemotherapy andradiation. Sometimes, a combination of these therapies is used. Theobjective is to remove the tumor, after which the patient is consideredcured. 2. Treat cancer using natural therapy aloneThis therapy detoxifies the body and enhances the immunity system so as to immobilize cancer cells. It reverses the process of metastasisthrough stimulating the body's healing response against the cancer,rather than removing the cancer. The focus is on the whole bodyand not on the specific cancerous tissues. Very few doctorsrecommend this and fewer patients opt for this method as the onlysource of treatment. Yet, some patients have been miraculously curedby this method alone. This therapy is the most effective for early-stage cancers that have not begun to spread. It also works well in new cases of cancer,where patients have not undergone any forms of conventionaltreatment yet. Unfortunately, most patients only seek alternativetreatment when conventional treatments have failed. By then, manypatients are only left with a few months to live. During this criticalperiod, the natural-oriented physician will have not only to work hardat destroying the cancer by boosting their patients' immunity, theyalso have to fight to overcome the toxic effects of surgery,chemotherapy, and radiation. It is a tough job to handle given thevery narrow time frame.Natural Medicine94Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Like in conventional medicine, certain cancers respond better to natural treatments than others. Cancer of the breast, colon and lungs respond best to natural therapy. The leukemia and lymphoma families of cancer do moderately well. Cancer withextensive liver metastasis or pancreatic cancer is very difficult totreat both with either conventional or alternative therapy. 3. Combining conventional and natural therapiesThis method seeks to destroy as many cancer cells as possible through conventional methods with natural therapies as anadjunct, or vice versa. The patient is given natural therapies and compounds before, during and after going for the conventional treatments. Detoxification isintegrated into part of the overall treatment protocol. The body'simmunity is strengthened to prepare it for the negative side effectsresulting from the conventional treatments. After conventionaltreatment, the body will continue to undergo other non-toxic naturaltherapies to prevent cancer cell recurrence. Most people choose this option as the most sensible and logical approach. A. Combining natural therapy and chemotherapy Human and animal studies have shown successful and amazingresults with combined chemotherapeutic agents and naturalcompounds. The objectives and rationale behind combining conventional therapies with natural treatments are as follows:95a. To reduce the negative side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy so that a more effective and safer dose canbe given. High success rates have been reported in this aspect. Antioxidants such as vitamin C, melatonin and vitamin E have protected animalsfrom drug-induced toxicity without interfering with the drug's anti-tumor effect. It not only protects normal tissues from free radicalscaused by chemotherapy but also acts as an immunity booster andproduces healthier cells that need a high concentration ofantioxidants to function in optimum form. b.To enhance normal cell resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy or increase drug accumulation in cancer cells. Cancer cells adapt to stress more readily than normal cells. They are much stronger after being exposed to chemotherapy. Natural compounds will destroy the heat-shock proteins that protect the cancer cell. As a result, drug resistance of the cancer cells willbe lowered. c. Additive or synergistic cytotoxic effect with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. When natural compounds are combined with chemotherapeutic drugs, the cytotoxic effect is additive. Natural compounds andchemotherapy drugs may destroy the cancer cell through differentbut complementary pathways. The following are examples. Selenium, a natural supplement, has been proven to reduce both the adverse effects of cisplatin and multi-drug resistance inducedby cisplatin. Two grams of vitamin C can enhance the effect ofdoxorubicin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel against breast cancer polysaccharides PSK or PSP haveNatural Medicine96Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine prolonged the lives of tumor-bearing rodents and protected them from the adverse effects caused by chemotherapy. The natural compound glutamine reduces adverse effects caused by chemotherapy in gastrointestinal-related disease. Proteolytic enzymes help in absorption and tissue diffusion of drugs, including antibiotics and chemotherapy drugs. Quercetin and genistein act synergistically with many chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin. In addition, Green tea, emodin and ginsengalso have synergistic effects. However, the dosage administered isoften quite high. Vitamin E enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy against cancer cells and protects the normal cell. In a study conducted, vitamin A in the form of retinyl palmitate was used with vitamin C, vitamin E and other minerals inpatients with small-cell lung cancer. The consumption of thesevitamins actually prolonged the lives of these patients. Theirtwo-year survival rate was increased to 33%, compared with15% otherwise. Another natural agent, melatonin, also acts as an antioxidant and reduces the adverse effect of chemotherapy without lessening itsanti-tumor actions. B. Combining natural and radiation therapiesNot much has been researched into this area. More studies are needed to confirm the results on the effectiveness of antioxidants inpatients undergoing radiotherapy. However, we are sure of the factthat antioxidants protect patients from some ugly side effects of97radiation exposure including ulceration and fibrosis. These effects are often due to inflammatory processes that antioxidants can inhibit.Vitamin E, fish oil and silymarin are particularly helpful in this respect. DESIGN OF A SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATED PROGRAM A successful integrated strategy of treating cancer utilizing conventional and non-toxic natural therapies depends on threefactors: 1. Data collectionA set of detailed data on each individual cancer patient will have to be compiled. After a thorough study, doctors should use the leasttoxic therapy first. Strong treatments should only be used as a lastresort when other treatments have failed. The doctor will need to monitor the patient closely. He will use every possible medical and laboratory advancement including PET scans,cancer markers, and immunological studies to detect the presenceof cancer and monitor the effectiveness of non-toxic modalities. 2. Selecting the right therapyThe doctor must chart out a comprehensive plan and strategy for the cancer patient based on the data collected. Conventionaltherapies may be incorporated into the overall plan at strategic pointstogether with non-toxic natural therapies. There is a large variety of programs that can be offered to the cancer patient. Some of these include antioxidant therapy, dietary changes,modulation of the internal biological terrain, regulation of intestinalbalance with probiotics, detoxification of heavy metals with chelationNatural Medicine98Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine agents, nutritional therapy with supplementation, modulation to enhance the immune function, hormone therapy, antiviral andantimycotic therapies, psychotherapy and physical therapy. 3. Selecting the right timingIn general, patients with advance-stage cancers benefit more from natural therapies than from chemotherapies. As such, cancer patientswho are in their advance stages should not be too anxious and shouldconsider postponing chemotherapy if possible. They should trynatural therapies first. If this does not work, then perhaps they cango on to try chemotherapy. Cancer is a process that does not come on overnight. Do not rush into surgery unless there is a life-threatening condition. One shouldtry using the natural approach first as it will only take 4 to 12 weeksto see its effectiveness. It is not that long a time to wait and may beworth it in the long run. By using natural strategies first, the body's immunity system is strengthened. In early-stage cancers, this approach may be all thatis needed to reverse the cancer. It will also prepare the body for thetoxic conventional treatments if found to be necessary later. FOUR PILLARS OF A SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATED ANTI-CANCER PROGRAM In cancer treatment, there is no magic formula. All programs must be individually tailored to suit the cancer patient as everyone has adifferent reaction to cancer. We will now examine the four main components of a successfully integrated cancer strategy.991. Emotional and Psychological The state of the mind is an important factor when treating cancer. Patients must think positively. They must have a strong will to live ifthey want to beat cancer. Meditation and stress reduction counselingfrom the patient's psychologist, psychiatrist and religion may behelpful. We shall not deal with this in this book. 2. StructuralNatural components address the structural organ function that is the primary site of the disease symptoms. Conventional treatmentsfocus on the cancer growth to rid the body of such structural damage.This component is best dealt with by conventional Western-trainedallopathic doctors. 3. EnergyThis is the electromagnetic and vibrational energy that flows within the body through various energy pathways called meridians.Disturbance of such meridians is believed to cause organs todysfunction and lower our body's immunity. This disharmonycan be harmonized by using Chinese and Japanese herbs,acupuncture, acupressure, qigong, resonance, magnetic therapy,vibrational therapy and homeopathy. We are still in the infancy stageas far as understanding the potential and power of these modalitiesis concerned. Empirical clinical data point to their efficacy, althoughlong-term studies are still years away from being conducted.Nevertheless we shall examine some of the most popular ones onthe market in later chapters of this book.Natural Medicine100Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 4. Biochemical Chemical analyses of metabolic and energy pathways, hormonal, heavy metal, biological terrain, and mineral status are now readilyavailable to help the cancer patient. We now have about 50 yearsof scientific data in this area, and the knowledge is growingexponentially. A comprehensive program of nutritional supplementation, diet and detoxification can be tailored for the patient. A doctor who has both Western and Eastern medical backgrounds will be in the best position to deal with this component. A successful cancer treatment must incorporate the above four components. In the following chapters, we will look into the intricatebalancing of the biochemical pathway in a cancer setting. The latter comprises a myriad of related natural therapies. Each focuses on a minute but vital aspect of the overall biochemical function. IS NATURAL MEDICINE FOR ME? There are basically two types of patients. One type want their doctorto make the best decision concerning their cancer treatment on theirbehalf. These patients are not interested in doing their own research.They have faith in the current medical system, and are happy aboutit. If you fall into this category, then this book is not for you. The second group of patients like to make their own informed decision based on data supplied by their doctor. They may not be veryknowledgeable, but they are willing to learn, to find out, and to makethe final decision on treatment options most suited to them.Experience shows that patients with the most success in beating cancer are those that are most involved. Working with their doctor, they learn, ask questions, and take control and responsibility fortheir body.101But before you even embark on the process of natural healing, it is critical that you ask yourself whether you belong to the first or the second group of patients outlined above. Let me help you by outlining the three steps you should take to make this critical decision. No one should embark on a naturalmedicine program without understanding what it is all about. It iseasy for those who embark on this journey to fail. It is not easy by any means, the rewards are obvious. Step 1: Face the realityDo not deny that you have cancer. All adults do. You just have it more than others. You are not alone, and millions before youhave the same. What you have can be beaten. It is not the end ofthe world. Do not be afraid. Death is a natural consequence of living.Some have to go earlier, while others later. Know that it's the qualityof life that counts. Take a moment to focus on the real importantissues of life: Relationships you cherish Y our mission in life Nature and its beauty Being at peace with your Creator Clear your mind of negative thoughts. Cherish the life you have had and give thanks. The fact that you can even pick up this book toread is a cause for thanksgiving. Many are less fortunate than you.That is a fact. Do you want to beat cancer? It is done all the time. Those who have the strongest will to live also have the best odds of beatingcancer. Tell yourself \"I refuse to die!\" and list out the reasons why.Natural Medicine102Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Maybe it's your wish to be with your love ones, or you have a mission still not completed. Whatever the reasons may be, list them out.Without a reason to fight, no war can be won. Until your reasons forfighting the war on cancer are clear, do not proceed. Take your timeto think it through. Talk to your love ones. The road to beating cancer requires a change of lifestyle and thinking for many of us. Are you prepared to do what is right instead of whatis convenient? Are you prepared to admit the wrongs you have doneto your body in the past and take steps to correct them? Are you prepared to go against the advice of many of your friends or even some doctors? Are you prepared to be labeled as someonewho uses \"quackery?\" Do you seek acceptance, or do you seekwell-being? What is the reward? Is being cancer free a good enough goal for you? If you are a pacifist, it is best to put down the book now andenjoy your remaining days in peace and quiet solitude. Do not be afraid to say: \"I do not wish to change. I am what I am, and I will accept the consequences.\" Blessed are those who know who they are, for that is the true path to happiness. Do not let otherstell you why you should or should not fight cancer. The decision is apersonal one. There is no right and no wrong to it, and no apology isnecessary. If you have decided that you want to beat cancer, make a commitment, ask for a support group (perhaps your family or closefriends), announce your intention, and you are now ready to moveon. Incidentally, research has shown that cancer patients whoparticipate actively in a support group live on the average 18months longer.103You may take days to make this commitment. Do not move to step 2 until you are clear on this step. Step 2: Do your homeworkFighting a war requires a battle plan together with a general you can trust. Before you can have a plan and appoint your general, youmust first understand your battle in its every detail, the desired endresult, and the price you are prepared to pay. Talk to your doctor; get the official medical diagnosis, the staging, and any variance. Search the Internet for as much information aspossible on the cancer you can, from both conventional andalternative approaches. Verify that the prognosis and treatment planadvanced by your oncologist conforms to established protocol. Writedown on paper, questions you may have on your cancer. The morequestions the better. You need a general and a team in charge to fight this war. Who should they be? Are you comfortable with your current doctor? Doyou need a second opinion? Do you need other supporting healthcareprofessionals such as a nutritionist, and psychotherapist to help you? This is the time to gather as much knowledge, options, and data as possible. It may entail many phone calls, visits to professionals youhave never heard of in distant lands, exploring options that soundlike foreign language to you. Yes this is uncharted territory for you,and you need to do your homework as quickly as possible. Thegood news is that there are professionals out there who can helpyou, and this is the time to call them. Do not forget that your commitment from step 1 still stands. You are on track, and you are serious about beating cancer.Natural Medicine104Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Step 3: Make the decision Chances are your doctor may not be familiar with natural medicine and its role in fighting cancer. Give him a copy of this book andeducate him. Do the concepts advanced by this book make sense scientifically? Go to the library or the Internet. Search for studies on nutritionalmedicine and verify its effectiveness. Leave no stones unturned.You only have one body, and you cannot afford not to give it the best. Natural medicine is about lifestyle changes. It is about taking non- toxic food-based supplements in quantity. It is about a new outlookin medicine from the way you have traditionally thought of it. It isabout doing things quite differently than what you have been usedto. It is 80% mental and 20% physical. Are you ready? If you have decided to pursue natural medicine as the solution to your cancer, either as an adjunct to or in place of conventionaltherapy, read on.105/fl1rt\"The integrity of every cell in the body depends on the balance of free radicals and antioxidants.\" Stephen Sinatra, MD, cardiologist in his book Optimum HealthCHAPTER FOUR PREVENT MUTATIONS 106Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Genes are units of the chromosomes that control our heredity and the destiny of each and every cell in our body. They form the very core of human health. Changes in genes, more commonly known as genetic mutations, commonly lead to cancer. Such a mutation may be linked to thefaulty genes we inherited. More commonly, they are caused byimproper dietary habits, unhealthy lifestyles, or environmentalpollution brought on ourselves during our own lifetime. The main agent responsible for mutational changes is called a free radical. Fortunately, free radicals can be neutralized by naturalcompounds called antioxidants. Research cites that up to 60% ofcancer patients are taking antioxidants, with or without the knowledgeof their oncologist. The use of antioxidants as a supplement to conventional therapies plays an important role in natural non-toxic cancer therapythat every natural-oriented cancer patient must be thoroughlyfamiliar with. FREE RADICALS AND ANTIOXIDANTS Molecules contain atoms and atoms in turn are made up of a nucleus surrounded by an orbit of electrons. In a stable molecule, theseelectrons orbit around their respective nuclei in pairs of electricalcharges. This gives the molecule a net neutral charge in its stablestate. When the molecule is disturbed, it can either lose an electronor gain an extra electron. This results in a molecule with an unpairedelectron. Such a charged molecule is called a free radical. Free radicals are highly reactive. They will try to combine with other molecules in order to steal an electron to return to its stable state.When another molecule loses its electrons to this free radical,107Prevent Mutations it becomes a free radical itself. The process is continuous and self- perpetuating. Our body's normal metabolic processes produce free radicals. These free radicals are formed as a by-product in the production of ATP(our body's energy currency) from glucose. Some white blood cellsdestroy invading microbes and in the process produce free radicals.Free radicals are also produced by pollution, cigarette smoke and sunlight. Too much free radicals in our bodies cause cellular damage. Serious disease such as arthritis, heart disease, cataracts, cancer,Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are linked to a state ofexcessive free radical activity. Our body's fats, protein,carbohydrates, and DNA can be damaged by free radicals. Tissues and membranes that are exposed to free radical damage lose their ability to properlytransport nutrients. Lipoproteins are changed into a dangerous form,resulting in atherosclerosis and damaged DNA causes intracellularmutational changes that lead to cancer. Antioxidants comprise molecules manufactured by our bodies to remove the effects of free-radical damage. Antioxidants donate anextra electron to the free radical without becoming destabilizeditself. As such, it prevents the otherwise self-perpetuating free-radical process. CLASSES OF ANTIOXIDANTS There are many types of antioxidants. They can be classified broadlyinto the following groups: Antioxidant Enzymes 1. Super Oxide DismutaseThis enzyme contains a highly reactive form of oxygen. It convertsthe very reactive free radical super oxide into hydrogen peroxide, with zinc and manganese acting as co-factors.108Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 2. Catalase Hydrogen peroxide is less reactive than super oxide but is stillsomewhat unstable and able to cause the formation of free radicals.Catalase converts the hydrogen peroxide formed by super oxidedismutase, as well as other super oxides to oxygen and water. 3. Glutathione Peroxidase Glutathione removes peroxides that contribute to the formation offree radicals. Glutathione peroxidase then converts highly reactivemolecules like lipid peroxides into less reactive molecules. Molecular Antioxidants 4. Vitamin CVitamin C, a water-soluble antioxidant that moves around freely within the plasma, helps to recycle vitamin E and other antioxidants.Smoking lowers vitamin C metabolism and plasma thus resulting inhigh levels of oxidative stress. Vitamin C is essential for buildingstrong immunity and eye health and prevents cancer and heartdiseases. 5. Vitamin E This is a fat-soluble antioxidant that helps prevent oxidation of fattyacids and proteins. The oxidative process can change unprotectedLDL-cholesterols. When oxidized, the LDL-cholesterol particles areabsorbed by macrophages that lead to the formation of fatty streaksand atherosclerotic plaques. Vitamin E protects LDL particles fromoxidation and protects our vascular walls. 6. Carotenoids These are derived from more than 500 different pigments from plants.Examples are beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene and zeaxanthin.Carotenoids function in a different way. They act on a bad form ofoxygen called singlet oxygen and destroy it. A diet rich in carotenoids109reduces the risk of many diseases, including cancer and age-related macular degeneration. 7. Bioflavonoids They are also called flavonoids for short. Bioflavonoids arecompounds that are derived from plants and can be divided into sixgroups: 1. Isoflavones (found in soy), 2. Flavonols (found in onions and broccoli),3. Flavones (found in greens, including thyme and parsley),4. Flavonones (found in citrus fruits),5. Catechins (found in tea and apples),6. Proanthocyanidins (found in grapes and cherries). 8. Minerals Minerals such as selenium, zinc and manganese are effectiveforms of antioxidants. They \"assistants\" formany antioxidant enzymes. The enzyme super oxide dismutasehelps convert super oxide into hydrogen peroxides. The cytosolicform of this enzyme needs copper and zinc as co-factors. Themitochondrial form of super oxide dismutase needs manganese.Consuming minerals such as selenium reduces the risk of cancer.Fruits and vegetables are very high in antioxidants. Unfortunately,the food that we take everyday cannot provide the amount ofantioxidants needed for cancer-fighting purposes. For example, oneorange only contains about 65 mg of vitamin C. To get 2,000 mg, wewill have to eat 30 oranges a day. Similarly, to get the 400 IU ofvitamin E, we will have to eat almost 5,000 calories of food a day. There is also no single antioxidant that is better than others. All of them work together hand in hand. They also serve to regenerate one another. Vitamin E's antioxidative power, for example,can be regenerated by vitamin C. Hence, they work synergistically.Prevent Mutations110Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine SHOULD ANTIOXIDANTS BE USED? Not too many years ago, most doctors believed that antioxidants should not be used because studies have shown that antioxidants protect normal as well as cancer cells against chemotherapeuticagents, rendering conventional therapy less effective. Careful dissection of the experimental design of such studies show that cancer cells in these studies were given a single low-dosemicronutrient just before the start of a series of conventionalchemotherapy treatment. During the treatment, cancer cells did show resistance to chemotherapy and radiologicaltherapeutic agents. It is from studies such as this that the doctors assume that all antioxidants, regardless of dosage or frequency willprotect cancer cells and should therefore be avoided. We see two flaws in extrapolating the conclusion based on this experimental design to a clinical cancer setting. Firstly, the designassumes that cancer cells react in the same way to low-dose aswell as high-dose antioxidant therapy. Secondly, it assumes thatonly one dose of antioxidant is given. In reality, a series of doses aregiven during any program. More recent studies using antioxidants in the appropriate high and repeated doses show that they improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiological therapy . This is contrary to the conclusions drawn from earlier studies. These later studies showthat antioxidants when used at high and repeated doses deter thegrowth of cancer cells without affecting the normal cells, a totallyopposite conclusion. Let us look further into these studies.111A single low-dose vitamin C or E micronutrient can indeed stimulate the growth of both normal and cancer cells. In a trial study on theeffectiveness of beta-carotene, low doses were given to heavysmokers who actually had pre-cancerous cells in their bodies. Theresults showed that a single low dose of beta-carotene increasestheir chances of getting lung cancer. This is because both cancerand normal cells thrive in an environment of low-dose antioxidant.Smokers already have pre-cancerous cells in their body, and a lowdose of antioxidant actually nurtures such pre-cancerous cells intocancerous cells. On the other hand, in an environment of high doses of antioxidants, normal cells can protect themselves while cancer cells cannot. Theywill be destroyed by the antioxidants. High-dose antioxidants aretherefore toxic to cancer cells but not normal cells. This is a veryimportant lesson. Antioxidants therefore behave differently in differentdosage levels. They can be an antioxidant at one dose and become a pro-oxidant at another dose. If this is not confusing enough, we now know that cells, depending on their structural health, also reactdifferently when exposed to different levels of antioxidants. The mechanism of action is not totally clear. It is postulated that during conventional cancer therapies, the cancer cell's defensemechanism is weakened and unable to go against the high-doseantioxidant. The supply of extra antioxidants will help the cell gothrough a self-repair process. Other pathways have been proposed.For example, most cancer cells lines are low in the enzyme catalayse,resulting in a buildup of hydrogen peroxide which is a pro-oxidant.Vitamin C appears to work in this pathway of increasing hydrogen peroxide load in the body if the intracellular environment of the cancercell is high in iron (as many cancer cells are because cancer cellshave a high affinity for iron). Vitamin C therefore can have both anantioxidant and pro-oxidative effect.Prevent Mutations112Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Most research now confirms that a repeated high dosage of antioxidants destroys cancer cell while sparing normal cells.In fact, many natural-oriented physicians believe that low-dose antioxidant therapy is contra-indicated in a cancer setting. So far, studies have confirmed that: Antioxidants in low doses protect cancerous cells against the negative effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy and shouldnot be used. Different cell types have different reactions to nutrients. Melanoma cells are very sensitive to vitamin C but not soparotid carcinoma. The reverse is true for beta-carotene. Thedifference also depends on the nutrient dosage and the typeof cancer cell. A single low-dose micronutrient should never ever be given before, during, or after conventional therapy as it enhancesnormal and cancer cell growth. Low doses of antioxidant alonecan make cancer cells more active and grow rapidly. Ittherefore makes the situation worse. Some nutrients augment the effects of chemotherapy. Studies have shown that a high dose of vitamin C, beta-carotene, andvitamin E succinate causes a 50% reduction in melanomacell growth without affecting normal cells. In other cases suchas colon cancer, vitamin E has been proven to be moreeffective than 5FU alone in reducing metastasies. Antioxidants enhance the effects of hyperthermia without affecting the normal cell. What is Therapeutic Dosage? What should be the optimum dose of antioxidants to administer to cancer patient?113Unfortunately, there are no standard references established yet and none is expected. However, doctors who specialize in nutrition and natural cancer therapy will have the best idea. These therapeuticranges have been established mainly through clinical experience. The two terms low doses and high doses should be distinguished clearly in micronutrient therapy. Low doses are those that are established by the RDA (Recommended DietaryAllowance). They are usually given to people for prevention ofdiseases and for general well-being. High doses are doses prescribedto cancer patients for the purpose of destroying cancer cells withoutkilling normal cells. As mentioned earlier, the low and high doses for most of the micronutrients have yet to be established. In the case of vitamin C,the generally accepted daily dosage parameters are as follows: Prevention of scurvy - 35 mg Low-dose RDA - 80 mg For general well-being: 100 to 300 mg Anti-aging dose: 300 to 2,000 mg High dose - 2,000 to 10,000 mg Very high dose - for active cancer treatment and as an adjunct to conventional treatment: 5 to 50 grams Toxic dose - where cancer cells and normal cells are both killed: None established yet. The amount needed varies from case to case. In general, the dosage required to maintain cancer remission is lower than those usedto treat active and growing tumors, but will be significantly higher than those used to prevent cancer or for general well-being. In thisbook you will see reference to a \"therapeutic dose\". This is the dosethat ranges from high dose to very high dose. The actual dosageused depends on the size of the patient, the kind of cancer, and thegoal. Generally speaking, dosage used during cancer in remissionPrevent Mutations114Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine is towards the low end of the therapeutic dose range, while active cancer treatment would require a dosage level towards the high end of the range, if all else remains equal. Furthermore, high-dose micronutrients should be used at least 48 hours before chemotherapy and radiotherapy to protect the normalcells. Dietary antioxidant in high doses will enhance chemotherapyand radiotherapy effectiveness if given in a series and ondaily basis. SINGLE NUTRIENT OR NUTRITIONAL COCKTAIL? Some doctors prefer to use a single micronutrient to attack cancercells. Others prefer a cocktail approach that uses a myriad ofmicronutrients. But most nutrition-oriented doctors seem to favor the second approach because of the wider coverage andlower dosage required per nutrient. The body needs about 50 recognized essential nutrients plus hundreds more only found in natural whole food that is supplementedwith the proper brigade of antioxidants. The combined effect of allthese nutrients yields more than what can be have been expectedof any single nutrient. Gathering the right nutrients together at theright time in the right ratio is the key to turn the body into an optimizedcancer-fighting machine. Nothing else comes close. Many studies have been done to support this. A case-study was conducted with a group of lung cancer patients who took a mixtureof antioxidants along with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Theirintakes included 15,000 IU of vitamin A, 10,000 IU of beta-carotene,300 IU of alpha-tocopherol, 2 grams of vitamin C and 800 mcg(microgram) of selenium. The results showed that their survival rateafter two years was far greater than that of the control group.115Nutrients to Avoid Beware of an antioxidant called super oxide dismutase (SOD). It should not be used in high dose (dosage beyond therapuetic range) together with chemotherapy and radiotherapy as it becomesdangerously resistant to oxidation. Another group of antioxidants, namely N-acetylcysteine (NAC), tangeretin and flavonoids should also be avoided in high dose during chemotherapy or radiotherapy sessions. NAC reduces theeffectiveness of doxorubicin, flavonoids does the sameto tamoxifen. High dosages of any of these single nutrients are needed to elicit the above undesirable interactions. Why this interaction takes placeis uncertain. Normal therapeutic doses in a nutritional cocktail haveno side effects when taken by those in active chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Do not take iron supplementation unless you have an iron deficiency. Cancer cells are very much attracted to iron. They also have a higheriron content compared to normal cells. IMPORTANT CANCER ANTIOXIDANTS We will now examine some of the common antioxidants used in cancer programs. They form part of a complete biological networkconsisting of over 50 different nutrients. They all function separately.Different antioxidants work on different parts of the cell. Antioxidantswork as a team and no single antioxidant can function on its own.They rely very much on one another to carry out a particular function,just like one big happy family. The following list is not complete. Also not all antioxidants are necessary for each patient. We should select the most appropriatePrevent Mutations116Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine nutrient and the right dosage based on the type of cancer and the desired goals. 1. Beta-carotene This is a non-toxic form of vitamin A, which is otherwise a toxic nutrientif taken at too high a dose. It is a strong immunity booster, and itprovides the supporting nutrients that allow the carotene to beconverted into vitamin A without the toxicity. In addition, beta-carotenecan also prevent free radicals from damaging a cell's DNA. Suchdamaged DNA can cause cancer. Hundreds of studies have been conducted on the efficacy of beta-carotene in a cancer setting. An extensive research, forexample, was carried out in Helsinki. Altogether, 36,265 people werestudied to assess the relationship between the levels of vitamin Aand beta-carotene. The study also examined their subsequentdevelopment of cancer. When their blood levels of vitamin A andbeta-carotene were measured, those with the lowest levels had agreater risk for cancer. The report noted that cancer risk goes upwhen we lack these nutrients in our bodies. In another Harvard study,it was also reported that women with high breast tissueconcentrations of carotenoids are less likely to have breast cancer. Beta-carotene protects against prostate cancer in men. Japanese studies report that low levels of beta-carotene cause prostate cancer.In another study in America, it was evident that high blood levels ofbeta-carotene could protect the body against lung cancer, melanomaand bladder cancer. This study was performed at John HopkinsSchool of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore. The above studies show similar results pointing to the fact that people with high intakes of beta-carotene have a reduced risk of cancerand heart disease. The reason? Beta-carotene stimulates a moleculethat helps the immune system destroy cancer cells. It increases the117number of receptors on white blood cells in a molecule known as major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II). MHC II is integral inhelping monocytes, a type of white blood cell, direct killer T-cells tocancerous cells. In other words, beta-carotene is an importantantioxidant in directing the immune system to destroy cancer cells. Therapeutic Dosage 25,000 to 100,000 IU a day. Low-dose supplementation is not recommended, especially for smokers. 2. Vitamin C Vitamin C is found in plants such as rose hips, apples and citrus fruits. It is a potent water-soluble antioxidant. While most animalssynthesize their own vitamin C, humans do not. Vitamin C in large doses was first used in the 1950s to prevent and treat cancer and other diseases. In 1971, Nobel laureate LinusPauling, PhD and Ewan Cameron brought vitamin C as a cancertherapeutic modality to the forefront of medical research. Since then,a lot of attention has been paid to vitamin C and its excellent effectsin cancer prevention. The role of antioxidant in cancer prevention is now well established. Over the years, many studies have proven that people with a highdietary intake of fruits and vegetables are less likely to developcancer. This is because fruits and vegetables contain phytochemicalsand micronutrients that are antioxidants. Vitamin C is an integralpart of such fruits and vegetables. The only problem is that we cannotget enough of it for its cancer fighting properties from food alone.Vitamin C, in high doses, has been shown to prevent the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines and fecal mutagens, enhancing theimmune system, accelerating detoxifying liver enzymes and blockingthe toxic effects of carcinogens such as polycyclic hydrocarbons,organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals.Prevent Mutations118Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Animal Studies and Cell Cultures Studies by Linus Pauling have shown that a large dietary intake of vitamin C delayed the onset of mammary tumors in mice. Vitamin Calso delayed the onset of malignant dermal tumors in mice initiatedby exposure to ultraviolet light. Vitamin C and its fat-soluble derivative, ascorbyl palmitate is effective in preventing skin cancer. Vitamin C also retards colon, kidney andbladder cancer in animals. Many researchers have cited that animalstreated with vitamin C had tumors that were less aggressive becausethe stronger cells prevented the spread of cancer. Some in vitro studies of cell culture have reported vitamin C to be cytotoxic to several malignant melanoma cell lines, mouse sarcomacells and mouse ascites tumor cells. At low doses, vitamin C iscytotoxic to mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells, mouse cells from alymphoid neoplasm, human fibrosarcoma cells, and an acutelymphoblastic leukemic human cell line. Vitamin C is also cytotoxicto some non-malignant but cancerous cell lines. Mechanisms of Action Vitamin C is an excellent antioxidant that fights cancer. It fights cancer by: 1.Fortifying the immunity system by increasing lymphocyte production. 2. Salvaging cellular free radical damage.3.Inhibition of hyaluronidase, keeping the ground substance around the tumor intact and preventing the spread of cancer. 4.Destroying oncogenic viruses through its enhancement of phagocytic activities. 5.Correction of an ascorbate deficiency commonly seen in cancer patients.1196. Stimulating and stabilizing collagen formation. 7. Neutralization of carcinogenic toxins.8. Increases hydrogen peroxide and free radical generation in the cancer cell under a high iron environment. Tumor cells are more easily destroyed when high doses of ascorbate- induced peroxidation products are introduced. This is because thereis a catalase deficiency in these cells. The Evidence It is impossible to have a discussion about the scientific validity of vitamin C and cancer therapy without discussing the controversystirred by the Vale of Leven and Mayo studies. The famous Vale of Leven study was conducted by Dr Ewan Cameron and his associates, (later including Linus Pauling, PhD) athis hospital in Loch Lomondside, Scotland. This interesting studybegan in November 1971 with a small group of 50 cancer patientswho were given a ten-day course of intravenous (IV) continuousslow-drip infusion of sodium ascorbate in half-strength Ringer'sLactate Solution. After the IV treatment, the patients were given oraldoses of vitamin C of 2.5 grams every six hours for a total of 10grams in 24 hours. The dosage varied from 10 to 30 grams dailyand was continued indefinitely as long as the patient was alive. Theobjective was to maintain plasma ascorbate levels of at least 3 mg/dl. The researchers were happy to note an improvement in generalwell-being, vigor, pain relief and appetite within five to seven days.But by the 100th day of treatment, the mortality rate was only 50% instead of the predicted 99%. Of the remaining 25 patients, 20 died between days 110 and 659. The average survival periodwas 261 days. Five subjects had an average survival period of morethan 610 days.Prevent Mutations120Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Not satisfied with the results, the doctors conducted another study in 1978 with more stringent criteria. They also improved on the designin the original study. This time around, 90% of the people whoreceived the ascorbate lived three times longer than the control group.Long-term survival made it impossible to assess survival time withcertainty for the remaining 10% of the cases. At the time the studywas published, the survival rate of the ascorbate group was 20times that of the control group. The results this time were evenmore promising. In an effort to validate or refute the Cameron and Pauling results, the Mayo Clinic initiated a study on 150 advance-stage cancerpatients who had previously received chemotherapy or radiationtherapy. The patients were given ascorbate at the same dosage.The researchers reported no significant survival time differencebetween the vitamin C and placebo group. It is interesting to note,however, that the 27 patients who received no treatment lived anaverage of 25 days compared to an average of 51 days for the vitaminC or placebo groups. A vast majority of the subjects had receivedprior chemotherapy, radiation or both treatments. Due to widespread criticism that the Mayo study had not addressed the effect of vitamin C on cancer patients who had not received priorchemotherapy or radiation, the same researchers initiated a secondtrial. One hundred cancer patients with advanced colorectal cancerwere randomly assigned to receive either 10 grams of ascorbic acidor a placebo on a daily basis. The subjects continued on the treatmentfor as long as they were able to take oral medications or until therewas evidence of tumor progression. When this occurred, over halfof the subjects received subsequent chemotherapy (5FU) and vitaminC therapy was stopped. The researchers did not report survival time, as they did not continue the patients on vitamin C on an indefinite basis until death. Instead,121they reported that after one year, 49% of subjects who received vitamin C and 47% of the control subjects were still very much alive.Survival time was comparable to the Cameron and Pauling untreatedgroup for both groups. Dr Cameron and Dr Pauling disagreed with the Mayo study. They challenged it and pointed out that the study was a big mistake. Whatwas their reason? They explain that vitamin C cannot be started and stopped in cancer patients like a drug. The effects can onlybe seen with long-term therapy for life. It does not produce immediate results like a drug, as it is not a drug in the traditionalsense. Dr Cameron says, \"You know, vitamin C is a totally different therapy that requires life long treatment and cannot be administered for just10 weeks. Something is definitely wrong with the Mayo study.\" Uncontrolled trials conducted at two different hospitals in Japan during the 1970s also confirmed the increase in survival time ofterminal cancer patients who were supplemented with ascorbate.At the Fukuoka Torikai Hospital study, the average survival time was43 days for the 44 \"terminal\" patients supplemented with low levelsof ascorbate (under 4 grams daily) and 246 days for 55 of the patientssupplemented with higher dosages of ascorbate (greater than 5grams daily - averaging 29 grams daily) from the time the patientswere labeled \"terminal\". At the Kamioka Kozan Hospital in Japan, 19 terminally-ill control patients survived an average of 48 days compared to six patientson high levels of vitamin C who lived an average of 115 days or 2.4times longer than the control group. While the jury is still out on the efficacy of megadose vitamin C as mainstream cancer treatment, it can still be considered as anPrevent Mutations122Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine alternative form of treatment. Today, many natural-oriented physicians use megadose intravenous vitamin C as adjunct therapies or in caseswhere traditional modalities have been exhausted. Despite the unresolved debate on megadose vitamin C therapy, there is considerable epidemiological evidence pointing to the benefits ofvitamin C in the prevention of cancer. Some of the following piecesof evidence are worth considering: Bladder Cancer An epidemiological study was carried out in Hawaii comparing 195 males and 66 females with cancer of the lower urinary tract with twomatched controls. An interesting result reported was a decreasedrisk of cancer with an increased level of vitamin C consumption forwomen but not for men. Another study of 35 patients with bladdercancer showed that the serum ascorbate level was low for thosewith cancer. Colorectal Cancer Most colonic polyps develop into colorectal cancer. In a study involving 36 patients with polyps, 19 received 3 grams of ascorbatea day while 17 subjects received a placebo. The researchers noteda decrease in polyp area after nine months of treatment withascorbate but not with the placebo. In addition, a trend towards adecrease in polyp number was found. Stomach/Gastrointestinal Cancer Cohen and associates examined epidemiological studies and found 9 of 10 case-control studies and 10 of 11 non-controlled studiesyielded a significant inverse relationship between ascorbic acid intakeand stomach cancer risk. Administration of vitamin C to patients123with asymptomatic peptic ulcer resulted in a decrease in DNA damage in 28 of 43 subjects. Safety of Vitamin CReported side effects of vitamin C include calcium oxalate kidney stones, B-12 destruction, iron overload, and elevated urinary uricacid. However, studies of these side effects are not conclusiveespecially in healthy individuals. For example, ingestion of largeamounts of vitamin C results in only small increases in urinaryoxalates or urates. From a practical viewpoint, it is prudent to avoid high doses of ascorbate in calcium oxalate stone formers, patients on dialysisor with serious kidney disease, and possibly patients with hemochromatosis and other iron overload diseases. There is, however, one reported case of death associated with vitamin C intake. In a certain sub-population of terminal cancer patients who suffered from end-stage metastasis (stage IV), theadministration of high doses of ascorbate provoked tumorhemorrhage and necrosis, which resulted in the destruction of thetumor but also the concomitant death of the patient. Intravenous Infusion Most of us who are in good health can take up to 10 to 30 grams of ascorbate orally without any problems. But we must be carefulbecause a high-dose vitamin C has a laxative effect. The BowelTolerance Level (BTL) differs from person to person. Physicians using a mega dose of vitamin C of 30 grams or more often resort to slowintravenous drip as the delivery route of choice. The most commonlyused form of IV vitamin C is sodium ascorbate. The rate of infusionis kept below one gram per minute and osmolality is kept under tightcontrol to avoid harming the veins.Prevent Mutations124Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine While the specific protocol varies with each patient and the type of cancer involved, most IV vitamin C treatment entails a program offour weeks or more. There are two to three infusions per week, whichstart at a low dose of 15 grams and increase gradually. This issupplemented by oral ascorbate daily (four to 10 grams) to helpprevent possible rebound effect especially on days when no infusionis given. Vitamin C alone may not be enough of an intervention in the treatment of most active cancers. It does, however, appear to improve thequality of life and extend survival time. As such, it should beconsidered as part of a treatment protocol for all patients with cancer,whether they have chosen a primarily orthodox, alternative medicalor complementary approach. Therapeutic Dosage Dr Pauling recommends a dose of 1 gram to be taken 2 to 4 times a day. This amount should be graduallyincreased every few days by 0.5 gram until a total of 10 grams a dayis reached. When you have diarrhea, you have reached the BowelTolerance Level (BTL). The BTL varies from patient to patient. It ranges from 4-40 grams. When diarrhea occurs, reduce the intakeby 1 to 2 grams below the BTL and this will often relieve the symptoms. In more advance cases of cancer, Dr Abram Hoffer recommends taking 12 grams of vitamin C in divided doses throughout the day.Pure crystalline vitamin C can be dissolved in either water or juice.Start with 1-2 grams a day, if there is no diarrhea, the amount ofvitamin C intake can be raised by 2 grams on the following days.Mineral ascobate are preferred to avoid gastric irritation. Your body adapts to an increasing vitamin C intake. Do so gradually at the rate of 500 mg increase every 3-5 days as tolerated. Suddenlarge increase may cause diarrhea. Similarly any decrease in yourvitamin C intake should be done gradually. A sudden drop in vitaminC intake can lead to symptoms of scurvy such as bleeding gums125during tooth brushing or easy bruising even though your actual cellular vitamin C level may be high and are well above therecommended level. It takes approximately twice as long for thebody to get used to the decrease as it does to the increase. A highdose of vitamin C may also potentiate the action of vitamin E andother anti-oxidants to act as blood thinners. This may require you tolower your anti-coagulation medication or aspirin intake. 3. Vitamin E Vitamin E is a key nutrient needed for combating the effects of cancer. It strengthens the immunity system and is an important fat-soluble antioxidant. The use of vitamin E together with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is still under study. Nevertheless, there is some reported good news. Women with breast diseases benefit much from vitamin E therapy. This was proven in Baltimore during a study on 17 female patients and six controls. The ladies were given placebo tablets for one menstrual cycle, followed by vitamin E at 600 IUs a day for another two menstrual cycles. At the end of the study, all patients were tested for blood levels of estradiol, estriol and progesterone. The study concluded that 88% of patients reflected significant clinical improvements, confirming the fact that vitamin E is an effective treatment for breast diseases. Vitamin E not only augments blood levels of both estriol (E3) and progesterone in fibrocystic patients, it also increases the ratio of estriol (E3) and progesterone to estradiol (E2). E3 is the natural estrogen found in the body and is anti-cancerous. Progesterone is an opposing hormone to estrogen and it counter-balances the negative effects of estrogen dominance. The latter leads to estrogen- related diseases such as breast, ovarian and uterine cancer in women.Prevent Mutations126Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Positive studies on vitamin E include the following: Highly malignant melanoma cell in vitro can be converted into normal cells after three days of exposure to vitamin E succinate. Glioma tumor cells, present in the brain, can be reduced by vitamin E succinate. Non-Hormone-sensitive cells are converted into hormone- sensitive cells when exposed to vitamin E succinate. On theother hand, hormone insensitive cells are hard to treat. In the case of ovarian and cervical cancer, vitamin E slow downs activities of cancer cells without affecting the normalcells. In radiotherapy, vitamin E succinate helps to destroy the cancer cells and protect the normal cells. Tamoxifen, when combined with vitamin E, is more effective in attacking breast cancer cells. Therapeutic Dosage d-alpha tocopherol succinate at 400 to 800 IU a day. Some doctors may recommend up to 2,000 IU a day inmore severe cancer cases. Do not take the cheaper synthetic vitaminE which is far less absorbed. 4. Selenium Selenium, a type of mineral, is a powerful antioxidant that protectscells from the bad effects of oxygen free radicals. Certain studies have implied that selenium reduces the risk of cancer by binding with glutathione peroxidase to destroy free radicals andin so doing, protect cell membranes. Some even indicated that theuse of selenium reduces bad side effects such as nausea, emesis,and headache during chemotherapy.127Intakes of 200 mcg of selenium a day has been proven to reduce cancer deaths, especially in prostate cancer. Generally, cancerpatients often lack selenium in their bodies. As such, thesupplementation of selenium works synergistically with vitamin E incombating cancer. Therapeutic Dosage The intake of selenium should not exceed 500mcg a day unless under a physician's supervision. Be very carefulas concentrations of selenium at 1,000 mcg or more can causeirritations of the respiratory system, rhinitis, lung edema, broncho-pneumonia and a metallic taste in the mouth. Selenium dioxide mayalso cause erythema and toxic necrosis of the skin, a loss of hair and nails, tooth decay or even nervous system disorders. Conversely, high-dose zinc (more than 100 mg) supplementation should be avoided, as it is a known enemy of selenium. 5. Lipoic Acid This is a wonderful universal antioxidant because of its abilityto dissolve in both fat and water. When this acid is in a fatenvironment, it enhances the effectiveness of other antioxidants. Due to its soluble nature, it can cross the blood brain barrier while many other antioxidants cannot. A major benefit of lipoic acid is that it acts as an \"encourager\" and helps to regenerate other antioxidants such as vitamins C and E,coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and glutathione. Lipoic acid can recycle vitamin E by quenching tocopherol radicals. It indirectly reduces vitamin C or increases the levels of ubiquinol (a derivative of CoQ10)and glutathione, which in turn helps to regenerate the tissue levels of vitamin E. Therapeutic Dosage 500 to 1,000mg a day.Prevent Mutations128Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 6. Poly-MVA Poly-MVA is an alpha lipoic acid complex with palladium. It is a non- toxic polynucleotide reductase and has three different names, Polydox, Poly-MVA and LAPd. Here, MVA stands for minerals, vitamins and amino acids whilst LAPd stands for Lipoic acidPalladium complex. It was discovered that platinum is very deadly to cancer cells. Unfortunately, it is also very toxic to us humans. However, its cousin palladium is not toxic to us but can act against cancers. As lipoic acid is a powerful antioxidant that is water and fat-soluble, it allows the Poly-MVA to penetrate the cell membranes and the bloodbrain barrier. The primary functions of Poly-MVA are to: Protect cellular DNA Deliver the antioxidant lipoic acid into the cell Act as an intracellular electron donor Generate water within the cell Cancer cells cannot breathe and produce little water in the cell. They use more sugar and produce no oxygen radical pathways. When synthetic DNA reductase enters these cells, protein radicals are formed and these destroy the cancer cell's proteins. Normal cellsare not affected as they can convert the radicals into energy and water. Poly-MVA also repairs cancer cells that have been abnormally altered. It improves the synergy of other nutrients while its metal components activate vitamin B-12. Additionally, it also helps totransfer energy within cells due to the lipoic acid component.129In addition to its excellent anti-cancer properties, the following benefits are also derived from Poly-MVA. Improving memory Raising energy level Protecting DNA from free radicals Chelating cadmium, mercury and lead Slowing the aging process and Increasing muscle strength. Brain tumor patients have reported benefit from lipoic acid. High success rates have also been reported in breast, ovarian, prostate,colon and lung cancers. In Canada, initial trials were carried out by an oncologist, the late Dr Rudy Falk. Dr Falk noted that when Poly-MVA was used inconjunction with chemotherapy, patients reported benefits such aslessened pain, improved appetite, weight gain and revitalized energy.Ten years down the road, these patients who continued to use low doses of Poly-MVA recovered completely and had no further signsof cancer. Therapeutic Dosage Like other forms of antioxidants, the dosage level varies with patients. Those with advance cancer may take2 teaspoons four times a day for eight weeks before tapering off. For cancer prevention, one-half to one teaspoon a day is enough. Each 8-ounce bottle contains 240 cc or 48 teaspoons of Poly-MVA.Approximately 8 to 10 bottles will be consumed the first threemonths. The mixture is reddish-brown in color and does not requirerefrigeration. So far, there are no reported side effects or associatedtoxicity. Additional notes on Poly-MVA: Concurrent EDTA chelation therapy is not recommended because of its strong mineral content.Prevent Mutations130Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine As Poly-MVA needs free radicals available in the cells to transform them into energy, concurrent intake of high-dose vitamin C (morethan 200 mg) is not productive. Other antioxidants such as CoQ10 are not affected. No additional alpha lipoic acid is needed because this is already present in the Poly-MVA and its amount is sufficient to deal withthe free radicals. 7. Bioflavonoids These compounds derived from plants are more commonly knownas flavonoids. They can be divided into six groups: Flavonols (found in onions and broccoli), Flavones (found in greens, including thyme and parsley), Flavonones (found in citrus fruits), Catechins (found in tea and apples), Proanthocyanidins (found in grapes and cherries). Under normal circumstances, we can obtain most of the bioflavonoids from a healthy plant based diet. There are literally thousands offlavonoids, and more are being discovered each day. For cancerfighting purposes, we will concentrate on essential ones with provenscientific studies. A. Green tea When this is drunk regularly during chemotherapy, tumor regressionis shown. The ingredients in green tea are believed to cure cancer.But too bad, there are not enough anti-cancer components in a cupof tea. Besides, a cup also contains about 30-50 mg of caffeine,depending on how long the tea is steeped in the water. Since caffeineis a stimulant, cancer patient should best avoid green tea and takeit in the form of caffeine-free extract capsules.131 Therapeutic Dosage 4 to10 decaffeinated green tea extract capsules a day. B. Quercetin This special flavonoid destroys cancer cells whilst leaving normal cells intact. Eat more onions and apples if you want to get the best of this flavonoid. Quercetin performs well with chemotherapy agents like tamoxifen, cisplatin, adriamycin and radio therapeutic agents. It prevents thespread of cancer by stimulating our immune system the way that the potent antioxidants reishi and maitake mushrooms do. It also alters the mitotic cell cycle and genes in tumor cells and enhancesapoptosis. Quercetin also raises the intracellular glutathione level and acts well with hyperthermia treatments. Quercetin stops mutant p53 protein. It suppresses glycolysis and ATP production, interferes with ion pump systems and various signal transduction pathways. DNA polymerase B and I are also inhibitedby quercetin. Quercetin slows down the growth of estrogen positive and estrogen negative cells. It inhibits mutant p21 genes found in more than 50% of colon cancers. Therapeutic Dosage 2 to 6 grams per day. It is even more effective when used with vitamin C. C. Tangeretin This can be found mainly in citrus fruits. Bad news was reported in a study conducted on mice. It was reported that tangeretin blocked the effect of tamoxifen in mammary cancer.Prevent Mutations132Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine As such, do not use tangeretin in breast cancer treatment together with tamoxifen until the therapy is supported by scientific studies. In the case of low doses, it may be effective in cancer prevention. D. Resveratrol These are found in more than 70 species of plants, including mulberries, peanuts and particularly in grapes. Resveratrol serves as a defensive molecule that acts against fungus in grapes and other crops. It is found in abundance in crops that arenot treated with artificial fungicides. Plenty of resveratrol is found inthe skin of grapes. Fresh grape skin contains about 50 to 100micrograms of resveratrol while red wine concentrations range from1.5 to 3 milligrams per liter. Resveratrol is a strong antioxidant that stops the enzymes necessary for cancer growth. It also inhibits cyclo-oxygenase, a cancer promoter. In a clinical study, cells in a HL60 human leukemia cell line that were exposed to resveratrol were destroyed. This flavonoid alsoprevents the development of preneoplastic lesions in mousemammary glands treated with a carcinogen in culture. Additionally,it also inhibits other tumor growths in mice. So far, there are noreported toxic side effects. Therapeutic Dosage 50 to 500mg per day. Cancer patients should not take alcohol due to its toxic effect on the liver. WHAT SHOULD YOU DO? You now know about the power of some of these proven anti-cancer antioxidants. Widespread research has proven that the careful use of antioxidants can help you combat cancer, and reduce side effectsfrom conventional therapy if you are undergoing such a treatment.133High success rates have also been recorded in the prevention of cancer. Through the years, occasional negative studies do surface. Such negative studies appear to be mediated by a number of conditions,including the concentration of the antioxidant, the presence of metal ions and the tumor's ability to produce antioxidant enzymes, the length of administration, difficulty of controlling parameters, and faultyexperimental designs. Generally speaking, from what we have seen clinically the past 50 years, high doses of antioxidants destroy cancer cells, while a low dose creates an antioxidant effect. Several studies in animals have also showed that antioxidants have helped to shrink the tumor size and increase longevity. Doubtless,our knowledge of antioxidants in a cancer setting is still in its infancystages. The interactions of antioxidant and chemotherapy cannot be predicted solely based on a set of presumed mechanisms. But luckily, more and more evidence has been gathered to prove thathigh and continuous doses of antioxidants are beneficial during andafter chemotherapy. Antioxidants are not the only non-toxic form of natural cancer treatment. They should be viewed in a supportive role and be combined with other drugs or conventional therapies when treating cancer. That is the best use of this class of natural therapeutic agents.Prevent Mutations134Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine135/fl1rt\"Cancer is an energy wasting disease. Ensuring optimum energy production is a key to cancer recovery.\" Maria Sulindro, MD, anti-aging and physical medicine specialist.CHAPTER FIVE OPTIMIZING MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION 136Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine In the last chapter, we saw how free radicals can damage the cellular nucleus, leading to mutational changes and ultimately to cancer. Let us now turn to the other components within the cell that can play a role in cancer-fighting as well. Recall earlier we mentioned that cancer cells love sugar. They live on it and use it as their energy fuel, instead of oxygen.Unfortunately, this is not an effective use of resources. The amountof energy produced when sugar is used as a fuel is far less thanwhen oxygen is used. In fact, 40% of cancer patients die ofmalnutrition because the food they eat is broken down into sugarwhich is robbed by cancer cells to the extend that regular cells aredeprived of the much needed nutrition. As you will see later, one ofthe most important tools we have against cancer is to starve itof sugar. Given the compromised energy generation state of our cells, are there any natural compounds that can increase the efficiency of ourcell in generating more energy in our fight against cancer? You cannotfight cancer when you have no energy. Optimizing the production ofenergy may not be important for a healthy adult but it becomes lifeand death for the cancer-stricken patient. Nutrients that are especially important to enhancing energy generation which occurs in the mitochondria include CoQ10, magnesium, and benzoquinone compound madenaturally human body. The \"Q\" refers to the quinone chemicalgroup. The number \"10\" refers to the isoprenyl chemical subunits137Optimizing Mitochondrial Function that are part of this compound's structure. CoQ10 is used in the body in a process called aerobic respiration, where oxygen and sugarare converted to energy. CoQ10 enhances antibody synthesis, macrophages and T-cell activities. It prevents oxidative damages to the cell's DNA. As such,these processes help the mitochondria to generate energy. The bodyalso uses CoQ10 as an endogenous antioxidant. Undeniably, CoQ10 is viewed as a potent membrane stabilizer. Many scientists today believe that CoQ10 is excellent for heart diseasepatients. Over the past years, it has acquired a reputation for curingheart diseases. The reason is simple, cardiac cells are the mostactive and energy-demanding cells in the body. They keep theheart going 24 hours a day without a break. In fact, the highestconcentration of mitochondria is located in cardiac cells. CoQ10 helpscancer patients by protecting their hearts from being damaged bychemotherapy drugs and effects. Human/Clinical Studies The use of CoQ10 as a standard conventional treatment for canceris yet to be established. On the other hand, the good news is that inanimal studies, the use of coenzyme Q10 shows good results.Inspired by this success, experiments are being conducted in variousparts of the world by scientists eager to test its protective powersagainst the heart toxicity in cancer patients treated with theanthracycline drug doxorubicin. A. Case-study in Denmark In Denmark, 32 breast cancer patients were closely observed for 18months. Their cancer had already spread to the auxiliary lymphnodes, which is not a very positive sign. What the researchers did138Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine with this group of ladies was to supplement them with vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, other vitamins and trace minerals, essentialfatty acids and CoQ10 daily. At the same time, they also underwentsome forms of conventional treatment. Checks were done on these patients every three months. To help the doctors detect any signs of the cancer worsening,mammography, bone scan, X-ray or biopsy were performed. Towardsthe end of the study, the report showed an unbelievable survivalrate of 100%! The patients also claimed that the decreased use ofpainkillers improved their quality of life. They also did not suffer anyweight lost due to the effects of the cancer. Out of the 32 breast cancer patients, six had warning signs that their cancer was returning. Doctors quickly gave two of them a higherdose of CoQ10. After three to four months, both patients reportedcomplete regression of their breast tumors, confirmed by clinical examination and mammography. B. Research Study in Texas The first person to pioneer the study of CoQ10 was Karl Folkers, from the University of Texas. Similar to the study in Denmark, he also chose 32 breast cancer patients, with ages ranging between 32 to 81 years. The patientsare already at the advance stage as the cancers have spread totheir lymph nodes. Karl Folkers instructed them to consume thefollowing nutrients for 18 months on a daily basis in addition to theirconventional treatment. 1. 2,850 mg of vitamin C 2. 2,500 IU of vitamin E3. 90,000 IU of beta-carotene1394. 387 mcg of selenium (plus secondary vitamins and minerals) 5. 1.2 gm of gamma linolenic acid6. 3.5 gm of omega-3 fatty acids7. 90 mg of CoQ10 The results were quite similar to the Denmark case. Two years down the road, all the patients were still living! All 32 patients were stillvery much alive and kicking, although four were expected not to pull through. Six of them showed partial tumor regression. The ambitious scientists then decided to increase the prescribed dose of CoQ10 from 90 mg to 390 mg per day in one of the patients.She was a 59-year-old woman with a family history of breast cancerand had already been diagnosed as having breast cancer. Herdosage of CoQ10 was raised to 390 mg per day. Within a month,the tumor spontaneously shrunk. After two months, mammographyconfirmed that her tumor had disappeared completely. Anotherremarkable achievement in such a short time frame! Wouldn't it befantastic if all cancer patients can be cured in two months? Inspired by this success, doctors decided to try this once again on another 74-year-old woman. This was a pessimistic lady who refused further surgery after learning that her breast cancer had not been eradicated by a previous surgery. She was then given daily doses of390 mg of CoQ10. Within two to three months, clinical examination showed that her breast tumor was no longer there. Dr Folkers explained that breast cancer patients have a much lower blood level of CoQ10 than normal people. As such, breast cancer can be suppressed by taking supplements of CoQ10. Women withlow CoQ10 levels have a 38.5% chance of getting breast cancer. On a different front, cervical cancer patients have been found to have a lower level of CoQ10 and vitamin E level in their cells.Optimizing Mitochondrial Function140Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine On the other hand, post-menopausal women who are on statin drugs to lower their cholesterol level have higher chances of getting breast cancer. Statin drugs, oral diabetic agents, anti-depressants, beta-blockers andhyperthyroidism will also deplete the endogenous CoQ10 levels in our bodies. Therapeutic Dosage 100 to 300mg. Patients with concurrent heart disease will need a much higher dose of 350 to 400 mg per day. As the blood levels of CoQ10 are easily depleted in cancer patients, supplementsare needed for those undergoing chemotherapy radiation therapy. MAGNESIUM In our bodies, thousands of enzymatic reactions take place that influence the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleic acid proteinsand ion transportation. 300 of these functions require magnesium which is central to the cell cycle and it is therefore an important mineral in ourdaily lives. It is estimated that up to 80% of the American population does not meet the RDA of 350 mg. Magnesium controls the key rate-limiting steps in the cell cycle at the onset of DNA synthesis and mitosis which in turn control cell reproduction and growth. A deficiency of magnesium in the body reduces the efficiencyof functions such as protein synthesis that are dependent on magnesium. Another function adversely affected is energy production in the cellular respiratory chain in the mitochondria. This will make the patient feel tired.A lack of magnesium also depresses cell-mediated immunity, such as phagocytic activity, as well as lymphocytic functions. Damage in the cell membrane caused by a lack of magnesium and vitamin E leads to freeradicals and peroxidation of membrane lipids. These are linked to the production of cancer cells. As you can see, magnesium is vital for the continued well-being of the cell. Hypomagnesaemia, the medical term for magnesium deficiency, is common among patients with pelvic or abdominal cancer. Significantly,141Optimizing Mitochondrial Function some chemotherapy drugs intensify magnesium deficiency. For example, one such drug, Amphotericin B, binds magnesium to the cell membrane and makes it less active. Another drug called Cisplatin. This drug also interferes with magnesium cellular metabolism resulting in arrhythmia inwhich the heart beats irregularly. Some chemotherapy drugs cause mitochondrial and nucleic magnesium depletion. This results in hemorrhage, arrhythmia and stroke. Magnesium is also depleted during radiotherapy processes, especially in the intestineswhere magnesium is absorbed. Unfortunately, most people living in advance and developed countries lack magnesium in their diets. It is estimated that as much as 70% of theAmerican adult population is not meeting the RDA of 300 mg magnesiuma day. As mentioned earlier, a deficiency in magnesium can lead to canceras immuno-competence that eliminates transformed cells, depends onmagnesium. Chronic magnesium deficiency has been linked to lymphaticsarcomas and leukemia in rats. As such, optimal magnesium intake maybe a prophylactic against the onset of cancer. Interesting enough, there are some doctors who feel that magnesium supplementation has no effect on reducing tumor growth. In fact, theybelieve that large doses of magnesium supplementation can lead toincreased tumor growth of established carcinomas. The intake of magnesium and calcium is commonly linked. The recommended daily allowance for calcium ranges from 1,000 mg to 1,500mg a day. In the case of magnesium, it is only 300 mg. The intake ofcalcium and magnesium is therefore 4:1. Some doctors said that themore appropriate dietary ratio should be closer to 1:1. Some evenrecommend a ratio of 1:2 in normal healthy adults. Therapeutic Dosage Despite controversial findings that magnesium deficiency might be implicated in the treatment of cancer, we should142Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine maintain a calcium/magnesium ratio of 1:1 for those with cancer. Magnesium supplementation of about 500 to 750mg a day isrecommended. B COMPLEX VITAMINS Vitamin B complex performs a variety of functions. One of the important functions is to produce energy at the cellular level. If you have a well-balanced diet, you should have enough B vitamins. However, cancer patients may require supplements for optimum body function. Therapeutic Dosage Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, and B6 should be taken in optimal dosage. Cancer patients may benefit from a higher dose of B3and B5. They also often lack vitamin B12 due to their absorption problems.But, a word of caution, high doses of vitamin B12 may lead to cancerinstead. Therefore, oral or sublingual doses of vitamin B12 should notexceed 3,000 mcg daily or 1,000 mcg intramuscularly (that is by injection) twice a week. Niacinamide 1,000 mg - 1,500 mg as well as panthothenic acid 900 mg - 1,500 mg is also recommended.143 /fl1rtCHAPTER SIX BOOSTING YOUR IMMUNITY \"If you don't address the immune system, you're treating cancer without really treating the cause of cancer.\" Victor A Marcial-Vega, MD, Radiation Oncologist in The Definitive Guide to Cancer144Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine At least 95% of all cancer patients are immuno-suppressed due to physical, chemical, mental, and/or environmentalcauses. \u2014 Marcial-Vega, MD, radiation oncologist and alternative cancer physician. Our body fights bacteria and germs via a magnificent and well coordinated network of cells, organs and glands. This defense network is called our immunity or natural defense system. This defense army consists of a whole team of soldiers. They use different weapons such as the lymph system, sweating, fevers,excretion, phagocytes, white blood cells, lymphocytes, white bloodcells and immunoglobulins. They all work together to protect thebody from external and internal insults. Maintaining a well-balanced immune system lays the foundation to good health and longevity. Today, we all know that the immunesystem plays an important role in preventing and fighting cancer.More and more cancer researchers now pinpoint a weak immunesystem as a primary causative factor in cancer. Addressing theimmune system is therefore a key to any comprehensive cancertreatment program, conventional or otherwise. BASICS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM The soldiers of our immune system are called antibodies. There aremany different forms of antibodies. They are classified into five majorclasses, IgA (immunoglobulin A), IgD, IgG, IgM and IgE. Each classhas its own function. They work together to ensure that all foreignbodies are destroyed. In our immune system are two important elements called T- and B- lymphocytes. B-lymphocytes make and distribute antibodies145Boosting Your Immunity in our bodies. T-lymphocytes are in charge of the cell's immunity. They act as a command post from which most orders for the immunesystem flows. They stimulate macrophages and B-lymphocytes.T-lymphocytes are the pillars for protecting the body from diseases such as bacterial infections, strong viruses, fungi, cancer, andparasitic infections. T-lymphocytes are assisted by a group of T-helper cells. They help to control various white blood cells by issuing chemical codes knownas cytokines. Some examples are interleukins and interferons.T-helper cells coordinate the actions of white blood cells and destroy unwanted substances. Our bodies also manufacture T-suppressor cells to slow down the destructive activities of cytokines from other white blood cells. Thisis an important function as it serves to protect the healthy cells. Thecorrect ratio of T-helper to T-suppressor cells is crucial. It maintainsa balance between the aggressive actions to destroy bad cells whilstprotecting the good cells. According to alternative physician Douglas Brodie, MD, HMD physician who is licensed both in homeopathy and allopathy, Many patients tend to believe that if they get rid of a tumor, then have succeeded and nothing more needs to be done.However, it is precisely at this point that diet and supplementsplay their most profound role, helping to keep cancerfrom recurring. Today, biology's greatest achievements have given us much research findings about the immunity boosting agents derived from naturalsources. Scientists have so far pinpointed many as immunity-buildingagents. We will now look at a few examples, how they originate,their effectiveness and their usage.146Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 1. Cat's Claw Cat's claw is also called \"una de gato\" in Spanish. It can be found on trees in the rain forests of the Andes Mountains, particularly in Peru.It is a 100-foot long woody vine. This herb has been investigated at many centers in Peru, Austria, Germany, England, Hungary and Italy since the 1970's. Thesestudies have concluded that the herb is useful in the treatmentof arthritis, bursitis, allergies, diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome,cancer, herpes, organic depression, menstrual irregularities anddisorders of the stomach and intestines. Compared with Echinacea, golden seal, astragalus, and Siberian ginseng, cat's claw is far superior in its antibacterial and immunebuilding properties. Cat's claw enhances the immune system in a general way. The unique alkaloids found in cat's claw enables white blood cells tobetter swallow and digest harmful organisms in the body. Themost immunologically active alkaloid is called isoteropodine orisomer A. Cat's claw has been proven to increase the production ofleukocytes and T4-lymphocytes, thus blocking the advances of manyviral diseases. Also, the excellent antioxidant properties of cat's claw help prevent the hardening of the arteries and heart disease. Long ago, waybeyond the time of our forefathers, the bark of the root was used as the medicinal part. Today, the bark from the vine is used. Therapeutic Dosage One cup of infusion to be drank three times a day or 1 to 2 ml twice a day. In the form of dry standardized extract,20 to 60 mg is to be taken daily. The amount should be increased to1472 to 6 grams a day for those in remission and tripled in advance- stage cases. As cat's claw may cause the immune system to reject foreign cells, anyone with an organ or tissue transplant should not take it. If youare suffering from auto-immune illnesses, multiple sclerosis ortuberculosis, you should also avoid it. Cat's claw is not suitable forpregnant women and children below two years old. Those peopleon blood thinners such as aspirin or warfarin should use it carefullywith a physician's guidance as it may also block platelets from formingblood clots and increase the effectiveness of blood thinning drugs. 2. Olive Leaf This is a relative newcomer in the antioxidant arena. It only made itsmaiden appearance in the mid-1980s. Despite its being a relativelynew discovery in America, successful studies have indicated that itcan treat illnesses caused by certain retroviruses, bacteria orprotozoans. Influenza, the common cold, meningitis, Epstein-Barrvirus herpes and II, human 7, shingles, HIV/ARC/AIDS, chronic fatigue, hepatitis B,pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhea, malaria, dengue fever,bacteremia, severe diarrhea, blood poisoning, and ear, urinary tractand surgical infection can also be treated with olive leaf extract. Some people have claimed the benefits of olive leaf such as relief for psoriasis, normalization of heart beat irregularities and less pain from hemorrhoids, toothaches and chronically achy joints. The active ingredient in olive leaf is called Oleuropein. It is made from an ingredient found on olive trees that protect the trees againstinsects and bacteria.Boosting Your Immunity148Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Research and extensive medical studies confirm that olive leaf extract is anti-viral because it can damage the harmful viruses and bacteriain an infected person. It also has other healing properties such as: 1. An ability to interfere with amino acid production for viruses; 2. An ability to contain viral infection and spread by preventing virus shredding, budding or assembly at the cell membrane; 3.The ability to directly penetrate infected cells and stop viral replication. Olive leaf extract can boost our immune system by increasing phagocytes in white blood cells. This leads to a destruction of foreignbacteria and viruses that are literally gobbled up by the phagocytes. Therapeutic Dosage The standardized extract is the best. It contains at least 20% of active ingredients. The recommendeddosage is 500 mg to 2,000 mg a day. 3. Essiac Herbs This herb has the most interesting origin. Long ago, in Canada, theOjibwa native tribe's medicine men had a mixture of herbs to treatillnesses. Later, in 1922, this formula was passed on to a Canadiannurse called Rene Caisse. She asked for this formula as a standbyin case she ever needed it in future. One day, her aunt fell ill with cancer and was given six months to live. Left with no other alternative, Rene decided to try outthis tea on her dying aunt. A miracle happened. Her aunt survivedand lived on for another 21 years. She eventually died of oldage. This tea was then named \"Essiac\" spelling Rene's familyname backwards.149Inspired by her aunt's success with the tea, Rene Caisse began to offer this wonderful and magical recipe to anyone who asked for it.Soon thereafter, Dr Charles Brusch, who was the doctor to formerUS President John F. Kennedy, learned about the success story ofthe tea. He became very interested and became a research partnerwith Rene. Nurse Caisse mixed four different herbs, namely burdock root, slippery elm, sheep sorrel and turkey rhubarb root. The differentherbs work together harmoniously to purify the blood, help cell repairand ease pain. Burdock Root (67.7%) This herb shows promise for helping to slow down cell changes andstop cancer. It prevents gall and kidney stones. It contains vitamin Aand selenium, which helps to eliminate free radicals. The burdockroot also contains chromium, which is useful in regulating blood sugar. In another two experiments conducted at the National Cancer Institute, one showed that burdock root had anti-tumor activity inanimal tumor systems. The other reported no significant activity.Later, in another study, this same organization, claimed that whenthe substance benzaldehyde was isolated from burdock, the resultsshowed anti-tumor activity in the animal tests. We can see from theconflicting results that additional studies are needed. Slippery Elm (5%) This herb is rich in calcium, magnesium, vitamins A, B, C, and K.When eaten, it can soothe organs, tissues and mucus membranes.Not only is it effective for those with lung problem, it can also aiddigestion and relieve asthma.Boosting Your Immunity150Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Slippery elm dissolves excess mucous in organs, tissues, lymph glands, and nerve channels, and eases wastes through the alimentarycanal. When tested at the National Cancer Institute, it showed noanti-tumor activity in mouse leukemia systems. Slippery elm also contains beta-sitosterol and a polysaccharide, both of which have been reported to have anti-tumor activity in animaltumor studies. Sheep Sorrel (21.6%) This herb was heralded as a potent remedy for cancer some decadesago. It was used to relieve internal ulcers, clear skin problems suchas eczema, ringworm and herpes. Being richly endowed in minerals,vitamins and trace elements, it helps to nourish the glandular systemin our bodies. When aloe emodin is removed from sorrel, the latter manifests significant anti-leukemic activity. Dr Chester Stock at Sloan-Ketteringin New York remarks, \"The Sheep sorrel can help to destroy cancer cells in our bodies.\" He came to this conclusion after conducting some successful experiments. When a similar test was done at TheNational Cancer Institute, it was reported that no activity was foundin mouse leukemia systems. Turkey Rhubarb Root (5%) This herb acts as a gentle laxative and purges the body of wastes and toxins. It helps digestion. It also contains a substance calledrhein that controls bacteria in the intestines. In the test of animal sarcoma-37 systems, anti-tumor activity was demonstrated. On the other hand, at the National Cancer Institute,two samples were tested and found to have no anti-tumor activity in151mouse leukemia systems. Clearly there is much contradiction and controversy among these findings on the herbs and their anti-cancer functions. Essiac Tea has been used for over 80 years, with good anecdotal reports for treating cancer, AIDS, diabetes, inflammatory skinproblems, liver ailments, influenza, fevers, inflammation, thyroiddisorders, stomach ulcers and other old-age diseases. Studies have revealed that this blend of tea breaks down nodular masses to normal tissues. This helps to ease pain. Some patientssay that their tumors are enlarged and hardened after a fewtreatments. But, fortunately, they start to soften later. Sometimes,pus is also discharged from the infected areas. Strengthening the immune system is the main objective of Essiac tea. Nurse Caisse has said that even if the tumor does not disappear,its potency and invasive character is reduced. She recommendsthe herbs be used for six to eight treatments before surgery. Afterthat, it should be taken once a week for at least three months. It is obvious that our knowledge of how Essiac works is limited at best. As Dr Hoffer, MD, PhD, author of Vitamin C and Cance r, puts it, \"I'm not sure what Essiac does to extend cancer survival, and for all we know it may not have this effect. On the other hand, it's nottoxic and my patients have reported feeling good while taking it, sowhy not support them?\" Common sense tells us that the most effective treatment comes from brewing the tea from raw herbs bought from reliable herbalists. You should follow strictly the instructions for preparingthe tea. Many people may find this method a bother and too time-consuming. Such being the case, they take either an extract or theessence of the tea. Some busy people may choose to drink the teaBoosting Your Immunity152Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine that has been bottled. In fact today, most of the tea come in commercially preparations. These are ideal for general preventivemeasures but not for cancer treatment due to their low potency.Some companies have produced these herbs in a capsule form butwe are not sure about the efficacy of such crushed herbs. The mosteffective form is still the raw herb or the essence extract. A word of caution: Over the past few years, researchers have tried to improve the blend with additional ingredients, including other herbsand medicinal mushrooms. Already several popular commercialversions of this tea have added other herbs to the original four herbs.Be very careful. For example, herbs such as red clover have alsobeen included in some concoctions. Due to its hormone-like effect,it is not certain whether people with hormone-sensitive tumors suchas breast cancers should consume such \"improved\" versions ofthe tea. Here is a recipe for making essiac tea from raw herbs.The Essiac formula : 6 cups of Burdock Root (cut) 16 ounces of Sheep Sorrel herb (powder) 1 ounce of Turkey Rhubarb Root (powder) 4 ounces of Slippery Elm Bark (powder) Preparation:1. Measure out 8 ounces of the Essiac mix (the dry formula above). 2. Place two gallons of distilled water in a stainless steel kettle.3. Bring the water to a brisk boil (about 30 minutes).4. Put Essiac dry mix into the boiling water, stir and boil hard for about 10 minutes. 5. Allow to sit and cool slowly for six hours.1536.After six hours, stir it thoroughly with a wooden or stainless steel ladle. 7. Let it sit for another six hours.8. Return kettle to stove and bring to a boil again.9. When the boiling point is reached, turn off the heat and pour the contents through a stainless steel strainer into a secondstainless steel kettle. 10. Clean the first kettle thoroughly.11.Strain the contents a second time from kettle two to kettle one. 12. Pour the herbal tea immediately into dark amber bottles and seal them while still hot. (Note: Dark amber bottles may bepurchased from most any drug store or pharmacy.) 13. Store in refrigerator. Therapeutic Dosage This varies from 1 to 2 oz a week to three times a day. Don't take too much, for this can be dangerous. The most commonly recommended daily dose is 2 oz or 4 tablespoondiluted in 2 to 3 oz of water. This is to be taken once a day for thefirst 10 days, after which, the dosage shall be reduced to 1 oz in thesame dilution per day. The maximum dose is 6 oz daily in 2 to 3divided doses for advance cases. It should be taken for a minimumperiod of one to two years or even longer if necessary. As the cancerimproves, the dose can be reduced to two or three times per week.Heat 2 oz (four tablespoons) distilled water, then mix it with 2 oz ofEssiac tea taken directly from the refrigerator. Essiac tea should betaken at bedtime on an empty stomach, at least two hours aftereating. It can be taken in the morning on an empty stomach. If takenin the morning, do not eat for at least two hours after taking it. Keepthe Essiac tea refrigerated at all times. Shake well each timebefore pouring. Essiac tea is most effective when it is brewed from the original herbs that have been organically grown. It can be combined with otheranti-cancer treatments.Boosting Your Immunity154Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine This tea is absolutely prohibited for people with bowel obstructions. (Note that while the tea helps to improve transit time, if bowel isalready obstructed, taking the tea can lead to bowel perforation.)Avoid drinking the tea also if you have kidney disease, ulcers and colitis. Lactating and pregnant women as well as children below 12years of age should not take this tea either. People on anticoagulanttherapy must consult an informed doctor when taking the tea. 4. Hoxsey Herbs Up till today, the Hoxsey herbs are regarded as the biggest hoax inAmerica's medical field. Just like many cures in natural medicine,this label has not been entirely justified. Way back in 1900, Harry Hoxsey invented this herbal formula for treating cancer. It consists of two remedies, one to be used externally,the other internally. The external mixture consists of a red paste containing antimony trisulfide, zinc chloride, bloodroot, and a yellow powder containingarsenic sulfide, sulfur, and talc. This mixture is believed to destroycancer cells. The internal mixture is a iodide. This mixture is forimmune boosting. The mixture can be applied directly on the skin ordrunk as a tonic. When taking the Hoxsey herbs, patients are toavoid pork, vinegar, tomatoes, carbonated drinks and alcohol.Instead, they are encouraged to use immune stimulants, yeasttablets, vitamin C, calcium, laxatives, and antiseptic washes as wellas to think positively. However, many doctors were dead against Hoxsey and strongly criticized his ideas. Despite his successes, the American MedicalAssociation labels this treatment the worst cancer quackery of thecentury.155Hoxsey's idea is to stimulate the body's immune system to overcome cancer. By supplying the body with herbs together with digestiveenzymes, iodine and potassium compound, Hoxsey herbs providethe necessary nutrition. The herbal remedies can strengthen theimmune system Horxey's herbs contain a high concentration of potassium iodide. While iodine itself does not have significant anti-cancer properties,it helps the thyroid gland to function properly. At the same time,potassium helps in cells metabolism. The thyroid gland regulates the temperature in our bodies. People with under-active thyroids have a lower body temperature.As cancer cells cannot stand heat, we have to maintain aslightly higher basal body temperature to create an environmentunfavorable for cancer growth. Therapeutic Dosage This depends on your specific needs and whether the cancer is internal or on the skin surface. Be careful,some of the ingredients in the Hoxsey formula have negative sideeffects. Buckthorn bark may give you nausea and diarrhea if takenin large doses. Cascara, too, can cause diarrhea. When barberryroot is given to rabbits, it causes swelling of the kidney andcardiotoxicity. 5. Fish Oil Fish and its oil, once mocked by doctors as useless remedies arenow fulfilling claims beyond folk medicine's wildest dreams byemerging as one of the most potent dietary supplements. Fish oilcontains a high dose of omega-3 fatty acids that helps to protect thebody against a long string of diseases.Boosting Your Immunity156Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Fish oil stops the spread of cancer and stops the formation of new blood vessels as well. It counterbalances the effects of omega-6fatty acid's production of inflammatory econsinoids. This is becauseomega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids compete for cell receptors in thecell membrane. Omega-6 fatty acids also produce prostaglandin E2.This causes a weaker immune system, suppression of cytokines,attenuation of T-cell proliferation, inhibit macrophages and naturalkiller cells responsible for cancer growth. Furthermore, omega-6 fatty acids support the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) in many cancers and therefore helps cancercell growth. Conversely, fish oil prevents cancer cells from beingattached to healthy tissues. It also slows down the rate of tumorattachment in the lymph nodes. It is used as a useful adjunct duringchemotherapy and radiotherapy as well. Fish oil enhancescytotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs, including mitomycin, cisplatin,and vincristine. Experiments with low doses of fish oil fed to miceprotected them from methotrexate-induced small intestine damage.Human studies also confirm that fish oil increases the efficacy ofchemotherapy drugs. Breast cancer patients with high fat tissuelevels of omega-3 fatty acids respond better to chemotherapy. Inshort, omega-3 prevents cancer from spreading with or withoutchemotherapy. Therapeutic Dosage Most high potency fish oil provides 1,000 to 1,500 mg of fish oil with about 300 to 500 mg of EPA and 200 to 300mg of DHA per capsule. About 6 to 9 capsules are needed daily inadvance cancers. Fish oil in large doses has a blood-thinning effect.People who are on blood thinning medicine such as coumadin shouldnot consume excessive amounts of fish oil.1576. Iscador Iscador is a fermented preparation of the European mistletoe which is a semi-parasitic plant that grows on deciduous trees. Found inmany areas of Europe, America and Korea, it is used to treat cancer. Long ago, iscador was hailed as a potent medicine in the treatment of serious illnesses. We now know that it stimulates the immunesystem. In 1920, it began to be used for treating cancer. Today,iscador is given to patients in two ways. The first is as a centralcomponent of a complex treatment regimen. In the second, it is givento patients as a single agent. Iscador is now recognized in Germanyand Switzerland as a medicine. It is also used widely throughoutEurope at holistic clinics. Rats with cancer showed a 78% reduction in their thymus gland when given iscador. The thymus gland is a central component of theimmune system. Studies have shown that iscador reduces tumorsize and prolong lives. Patients with cancers of the cervix, ovaries,breast, stomach, colon, and lung should try using this herb. It canalso cure cancers of the bone marrow, connective tissue, lymphomas,sarcomas, and leukemias. Therapeutic Dosage Iscador is given by injection, near the site of the tumor or directly into the tumor. Direct tumor injection is mostcommon for tumors of the liver, esophagus and cervix. A treatmentcourse can last from several months to many years. The injectionsare given early in the morning three to seven times a week. Theentire course consists of 10-16 injections given in increasingconcentration and adjusted depending on the patient's generalcondition, sex, age and the type of cancer. Most of the time, there are hardly any side effects. But once in a while, allergy symptoms, higher body temperature and flu-likeBoosting Your Immunity158Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine symptoms are reported. Sometimes, the injection site is inflamed and abdominal pain with nausea may occur. The berries in the mistletoe may look beautiful but are actually very poisonous. Keep them out of reach of babies and children. Ifaccidentally taken, you might have seizures. Also, people onantidepressant drugs should not take this herb. When taking thisherb, you must be very careful and use it under close supervision ofyour doctor. Do not self-medicate with this herb. 7. Medicinal Mushrooms There are altogether 100,000 types of mushrooms. About 700 typescan be eaten; another 50 types are poisonous whilst another 50have medicinal effects. Some mushrooms are very pretty but almostall medicinal mushrooms look tough and woody. We can never judgea mushroom by its appearance. Research on the use of mushrooms in treating cancer began in the 1970s. Today, scientists have confirmed their unique healingproperties and have made it known that mushrooms enhance theimmune function and the work of the T-cells. The three types of anti-cancer drugs extracted from mushrooms are Lentinan derived from shitake; Schizophyllan derived fromsuehirotake, and PSK derived from kawaratake. These mushrooms have anti-cancerous effects because they contain apolysaccharide compound called beta-glucan. Beta-glucan has beenfound to exhibit potent anti-tumor activity in numerous animal studies. A. Maitake Mushroom This Japanese mushroom is nickname \"hen of the woods,\" as itgrows in clusters that resemble the tail feathers of a hen. Animalstudies have extensively analyzed this mushroom's effect on cancer159cells. When the dried mushroom powder was mixed into the animal's food, it could control and stop cancer. Like all other mushrooms, maitake's action is that of a host defense potentiator. However, it reigns over the rest of the mushrooms in theinhibition of tumor cells. The beta-glucan present in the mushroomactivates the natural killer cells of our immune system. Japanesemushroom specialist, Dr Hiroki Nanba says that the optimum doseis 25 mg per kg of body weight. He also suggests the dose to beincreased by three to four times when it is used as a supplement toconventional treatments. He discovered that four different fractions make up this special mushroom and called them Fractions A, B, C and D. When maitake D fraction is used with half the dose of chemotherapy, it shows tremendous effectiveness in stopping cancer growth. InJapanese studies, prolonged survival rates were reported whenmaitake was used together with chemotherapy. The D fraction isalso very effective when taken by mouth to enhance the naturalkiller cell, IL1. It has an advantage over beta-glucan as the latter is only effective through injection. In another study, D fraction prevents breast cancer by 80% when given orally. When given during the early stages, the growth of thecancer cell is cut down by 70%. The recurrence rate using maitakepower is 20% but for the D-fraction, it is only 10%. Maitake extract kills cancer cells in prostate and breast cancers. In liver cancer, a combination of maitake D fraction when taken duringchemotherapy at half dose shows good results. An amazing 96%success rate has been reported. However, when D fraction is takenalone, the percentage falls to 75%. In the case of mitomycin C, thepercentage is only a pathetic 46%.Boosting Your Immunity160Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Therapeutic Dosage Take 30 to 100 drops of Maitake Pro-D fraction and 2 to 8 grams of whole mushroom powder a day. Exercise cautionwhen buying maitake mushroom powder as there are many formsof it in the market. Always look for the genuine ones. Also be carefulnot to take too much as mushroom powder contains fiber that ishard to digest. You may get a stomach upset. Take the extract formof maitake mushroom instead. In the market, many suppliers do notdisclose the extraction ratio. However, do note that a 100 mg of 8:1extract is the same as taking 800 mg of dry powder. The higher theextraction ratio, the less you have to take and you will still get thesame good results. Good quality extracts run from a 4:1 to 8:1extraction ratio. However, they are usually more expensive than thepowder form. But spending this amount of money may be worthyour while in the long run. Maitake extracts when taken with 2,000 mg of vitamin C is even more effective . Some breast and prostate cancer patients reported a lowered prostate marker called PSA (a marker for prostate cancer)after taking this combination. Not much is known about the sideeffects of maitake. In rare cases, allergies have been reported butnot to a significant extent. Today, maitake mushroom is served as a delicious dish in many high-class restaurants. You can also buy themfrom the common grocery stores. B. Reishi Mushroom This pretty mushroom has a dark and shiny reddish-orange cap.However, a pretty surface doesn't always tell the inside story. In ancient days, the Chinese and Japanese used this mushroom to treat liver disorders, hypertension and arthritis. It is ranked by theChinese as one of the most potent medicinal plants in nature. Reishi has proven anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties. In vitro experiments show161that reishi can help fight tumors. A protein, which is isolated from reishi called Ling Zhi-8 can reduce the risk of transplant rejections. Reishi is hard, bitter and difficult to swallow. You can consume it either as a brew or ground in capsule form. Reishi has been provento protect the liver, as a tonic for the heart and central nervous system,to lower cholesterol, and prevent allergic responsiveness. It can alsoincrease the production of Interleukin-1 and 2 and stop tumor growth. Like in maitake mushroom, the active anti-cancer compound is also beta-D-glucan. Beta-D-glucan is made up of a huge sugar molecule.Within this molecule are little sugar molecules chained together tobind amino acids. These sugars stimulate the immune system byactivating immune cells such as macrophage and helper T-cells.They also increase the antibodies' effectiveness in producing a betterresponse to bad cells. According to Japanese scientist Dr Fukumi Morishige, reishi performs a better function when combined with high doses of vitamin C. Thepolysaccharides in the reishi are big molecules that are difficult toabsorb, but vitamin C helps to break them down into smallermolecules called oligoglucan. The body can easily absorb these. Assuch, vitamin C increases the bioavailability of reishi and enhancesits anti-cancer effects. The benefits of reishi are wide. Besides treating cancer, it is also good for the relief of arthritis, menopausal anxiety, asthma,hypertension, hypothyroids, insomnia and heart disease. Therapeutic Dosage Take 150 to 900 mg of concentrated reishi extract daily. Dr Morishige recommends a larger dosage from 2 to10 grams for cancer patients. The standardized extracts give thebest results. These are usually more expensive but they are genuineand up to the mark.Boosting Your Immunity162Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine C. Shitake Mushroom The commonest edible and best-studied mushroom with the greatest proven therapeutic powers is the shitake mushroom. We can buythese mushrooms in Asian markets or your local health food stores.This type of mushroom has lots of meat. They taste delicious andare often served as a dish or as an ingredient in a variety of dishesat home or in restaurants. Its use originated during the Ming Dynastyin 1368 A.D. During that period, it was esteemed as a longevitytonic. Shitake contains cortinelin, which is a strong antibacterial agent. It also produces an extract containing lentinan which stimulates theproduction of T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Modern studiesconfirm that shiitake can cure cancers and treat AIDS. In thismushroom there is a substance called eritadenine that helps bodytissues absorb cholesterol and lower the amount circulating in theblood. Japanese scientists back in 1969 conducted an animal study and isolated a polysaccharide compound from shiitake called lentinanas mentioned above. When lentinan was given to mice with cancer,their tumors disappeared in an amazing 80 to 100% of the subjects.They concluded that lentinan is able to boost immune-system cellsin clearing the body of tumor cells. Therapeutic Dosage Take 2 to 6 grams daily in standardized extract. D. Agaricus Blazei Murill (ABM)About 30 years ago, two curious researchers from Penn State University set forth on a journey to a village called Piedade. Theydiscovered that the natives were happy-go-lucky, very fit and hadvery low rates of disease. They lived in a bed of roses and enjoyed163longevity. To find out their secret recipe, the researchers launched an investigation and discovered that these natives favored eating amushroom called Agricus Blazei Murill (ABM). The two men found that the polysaccharide contained in this mushroom spurs production of interferon and interleukin. This effectdestroys and prevents the spread of cancer cells. Later, they alsodiscovered that ABM could cure Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma, sigmoidcolonic cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and livercancer as well as other solid cancers. In experiments performed onmice injected with cancer-causing agent Sarcoma 180, the injectionof ABM was found to be effective in curing 90% of these animals. Therapeutic Dosage 2 to 6 grams a day or its equivalent in standardized extract form. E. Cordycep Sinensis (CS) This is a rare and precious tonic found on the high plateaus ofsouthwestern China at 3,000-4,000 meters above sea level. It isalso called caterpillar fungus and comes in the form of a fine lightbeige powder. In Chinese, Cordycep means \"summer plant, winterworm\". They grow by infecting insect larvae with spores thatgerminate before the cocoon is formed. The fruiting body of theCordycep grows from the dead host. This tonic promotes phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages, enhances the function of the reticuloendothelial system and reducescholesterol levels. The ancient Chinese swore by this herb. For more than 1,000 years, it has been used to strengthen their health and enhancing theirimmunity after a bout of chronic illness. It is also used to treat lungdisease, impotence and restore renal functions. Cordysep is excellentBoosting Your Immunity164Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine for boosting cardiovascular health. Taking this herb can also help you to stay young and energetic. It is ideal for convalescing patients. It helps to boost appetite, enhance blood functions, and cure respiratory tract problems and susceptibilityto colds or flu. In China, this herb is reputed for successfully treating cancer patients. The reported ef fective success rate is an astonishing 78 to 94.2%. The same percentage of success is also reported in other illnessessuch as bronchitis, heart diseases, leukemia, lung diseases, cirrhosis,B hepatitis, and diabetes. Therapeutic Dosage Take 1 to 3 grams a day. Upmarket cordysep is very expensive and can cost over $1,000 per pound. Today,cordycep cultured through bioengineering processes has significantlylowered the cost. Take the standardized extract of 2:1 extract ratio that contains at least 20% of the active ingredient, beta-glucan. A capsule of thisstrength will yield about 140 mg of polysaccharide. The normal doseis 1 to 2 tablets per day. In more serious illnesses, the dosage shouldbe increased by two or three folds. Summary of Medicinal Mushroom Medical mushrooms are well-known for immunity boosting. Centuries ago, people began using it as a tonic and folk medicine for curingdiseases. Today, scientists are conducting much research and experiments on mushrooms. It is very clear that each mushroom has its ownunique anti-cancer properties. Maitake, reishi, shitake, and agaricus are good choices for anti-tumor activity. Cordycep isoften used as a strengthening tonic for convalescing patients.165In today's commercial world, enterprising mushroom vendors will try to promote their own as the most effective. Their prices also vary.The consumer should be cautious and only buy from reputable andreliable suppliers. Medicinal mushrooms have a high content of fiber. Be careful not to eat too much of it, as it may be difficult for the digestive system. 8. Ukrain The first clues of the medicinal value of ukrain came in 1978. AnAustrian scientist by the name of Dr Wassyl J. Nowicky discoveredukrain by marrying two components. One is a herb called GreaterCelandine. The other is a cytotoxic drug called Thiotepa. Greater celandine is a poppy-like plant that is full of juice. It has a long and outstanding folk history of disease-fighting successes. Thisplant contains alkaloids such as chelidonine that has anti-cancerpotential. The marriage of this herb and drug has given birth to the compound ukrain that is non-toxic to normal cells. This new product has theability to destroy cancer cells. Pregnant hamsters and rats showed no signs of toxicity in their embryos when this compound was injected into them. The only sideeffect was a slight decrease in the average hamster litter size. Inanother study conducted with healthy human volunteers from Poland,Austria, and Germany, those who received repeated courses of thenew drug had little side effects. Some local pain was reported in afew cases but it was not significant. Others informed that they felt alittle drowsy, thirsty and had to go to the toilet more often.Boosting Your Immunity166Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Ukrain was found to activate an enhanced immune system mechanism so that the body can destroy the cancer. It prevents thedevelopment of new blood vessels needed for cancer growth.The cancer cell is starved and unable to grow. Ukrain can also cureleukemias, lung cancer, colon cancer, central nervous system cancer,melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. In another study, Ukrain was given intramuscularly or intravenously every day or every second to fifth day for a period of ten days tothree months. A slight pain was reported during intramuscularinjection in the weaker patients. It was found to be effective for treatingearly-stage cancers. The success rate is high in the early-stagecancers and is drastically lower in advance cases. Ukrain is primarily available in holistic clinics in Europe and Mexico. 9. Lactoferrin This is a natural component from the milk of cows and humans. Lactoferrin helps to build immunity and maintains a stable amountof good bacteria in the intestines. As such, the number of bad bacterialike E. coli and streptococci are controlled. Lactoferrin inhibits several viruses that cause HIV and herpes. Its anti-cancer function is quiteunique as cancer cells contain more iron than normal cells. Lactoferrinhelps to bind iron in the cell and blood. It is able to do this becauseit has a strong attraction for iron. This is very important in later-stagecancers where metastasis is of primary concern. Therapeutic Dosage 300 mg to 1,000 a day in divided dosages. 10.Inositol Hexaphosphate (IP-6) Inositol hexaphosphate or IP-6 is derived from natural sources such as corn, grains, and legumes. People from Finland, whose diet isrich in IP-6, have a lower incidence of colon cancer.167IP-6 increases the activity of the cancer suppressor gene called p53 by as much as 17 times in some studies. The latter is responsiblefor inhibiting the pathway normal cells take they when turn intocancer cells. IP -6 can help in a wide variety of cancers. A larger dose is required for solid cancers compared to blood-based cancers such asleukemia. Successful studies revealed that when IP -6 was added to liver cancer cells, the cancer cells stopped spreading. In animalstudies, when liver cancer cells were injected into mice, 71% of themice had cancer. When liver cancer cells pretreated with IP -6 were injected, believe it or not, no sign of cancer emerged. Prof AbulKalam M. Shamsuddin, the world's leading professor of pathology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine inBaltimore said, \"IP-6 can slow down or stop the growth of liver cancer cells in mice. It does not kill cancer cells. Instead, it converts cancercells and makes them behave like normal cells.\" To reinforce his point, he added, \"Another compound called inositol can prevent colon cancer in animals. Inositol, by itself is less effective than IP-6 alone.But, when you put the two together, the effects are synergistic.\" In addition to its anti-cancer function, IP-6 can help lower cholesterol levels, thus reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke. It alsoprevents diabetes and kidney stones. Therapeutic Dosage The recommended dose for cancer prevention is 1,000 to 4,000 mg a day. This should be taken in two to threedivided doses. Active cancer patients need to take 5,000 to 10,000mg a day in divided doses before food. IP-6 is very safe even atextremely high doses.168Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine ADDITIONAL FACTORS TO BOOST IMMUNITY A. Immunity-lowering drugs such as glucocorticoids prescribed for asthma and other inflammatory conditions should be avoided. B. Get sufficient sleep and rest. They are very important.C. You should have a proper routine of exercise daily to build up your immunity. D. Live a less stressful lifestyle. You may need a drastic change if your present life is too pressurizing. Reducing stress willnormalize the adrenal gland and reduce production of internalcortisol, an anti-inflammatory and pro-aging hormone. E. Cut down on all forms of alcohol which is toxic to the liver.F.Start a proper diet and nutrition regimen. Supplement with your diet with vitamins A, C, E, B6 and folic acid. Moderatesupplementation with zinc, chromium, magnesium and seleniumis also recommended. G. Take more immune boosting supplements such as resveratrol, amino acid arginine and glutamines. Herbs such as Echinacea,goldenseal and glandulars such as thymus extract can help tosupport a normal lymphocyte proliferation and maintain a healthyimmune system.169/fl1rt\"I employ vitamin C as a first line of defense against cancer.\" Cardiologist and natural medicine pioneer Dr Robert Atkins, MD in Dr Atkins' Vita-Nutrient SolutionCHAPTER SEVEN STOPPING CANCER SPREAD 170Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Cancer can spread like wildfire. They can quickly cause much irreparable damage to our bodies. To extinguish this fire, we must first understand the ideal conditions for cancer to spread. It isnow known that in order for cancers to spread to other parts of thebody, they must be able to live in the following locations in our body: 1. The \"home turf\" of epithelial tissues where the primary organ of the cancer resides. 2. The connective tissues that surround the primary organ.3. The tissues of a distant organ site. HOW DOES CANCER GROW? Cancer cells grow and develop in three phases. Phase 1 - Initiation When a free radical or carcinogen changes the genetic make up ofa cell, the cell divides more often than it normally does. This is thebeginning stage. Phase 2 - Promotion In this phase, the damaged cell multiplies uncontrollably. Phase 3 - Progression In this phase, cancer grows through the process of invading the surrounding tissues and forming new blood vessels. It does so by releasing compounds that go against the body's natural defenseand penetrating into the surrounding tissues. The cancer cell buildsitself a blood supply network through angiogenesis and invadessurrounding tissues. Without sufficient blood vessel supply, solid tumor growths cannot grow bigger than 1-2 mm in diameter. Certain natural compounds have been shown to retard the spread of cancer cells in any combination of the above three phases.171These natural elements include calcium D-glucarate, curcumin, resveratrol, milk thistle, shark cartilage, bovine cartilage, vitamin C,L-proline, L-lysine, and bindweed. We will now look at their properties,functions and effectiveness in preventing the spread of cancer. ESSENTIAL NATURAL COMPOUNDS TO STOP CANCER SPREAD 1. Calcium D-Glucarate D-glucaric acid is a non-toxic natural compound that contains a beta- glucuronidase inhibitor. This \"stopper\" possesses the ability toenhance detoxification carcinogens and tumor promoters bystopping beta-glucuronidase and preventing hydrolysis of theirglucuronides in the liver. In a study conducted, calcium D-glucarate was compared with a chemotherapy drug called 4-HPR. The results were monitored basedon the first two phases of cancer and showed that calcium D-glucarate reduced tumor multiplicity. The percentage was the lowestat 28% for stage I and the highest for stage III at 63%. The studyalso reported two more points: 1.For patients in their second and third phases of cancer, the gloomy news is that calcium D-glucarate is not effective inpreventing cancer spread at these stages. 2.Chemo-preventive effect was synergistic when calcium D- glucarate was used together with 4-HPR. Therapeutic Dosage 100 to 200 mg a day.Stopping Cancer Spread172Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 2. Curcumin Curcumin is a carotenoid pigment extracted from turmeric. It helps to inhibit the progression of colon and skin cancers caused bychemicals. At the same time, it can also prevent adenomamultiplication and growth. Colon cancer patients may be pleased to note that curcumin works best in the promotion phase (phase 2). Studies have revealed thatcancer cells exposed to curcumin show shrinkage, chromatincondensation, DNA fragmentation and programmed cell death inhuman kidney and liver carcinomas. Curcumin stops the formation of new blood vessels as well (phase 3). In addition to its anti-cancer properties, it is also a potentantioxidant. Curcumin also inhibits abnormal platelet aggregationthat can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Therapeutic Dosage 1,000 to 5,000 mg a day in divided dosage. 3. Milk Thistle This compound should be introduced to all liver cancer patients. Milk thistle contains a special extract called silymarin. This herb actsas an antioxidant, protects the liver from damage and enhances thedetoxification process. It is far superior to vitamin C and E in its effectiveness. Silymarin helps to protect the liver from toxic chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride, amanita toxin, galactosamine andpraseodymium nitrate. It also prevents the depletion of glutathionethat is essential for detoxifying harmful chemicals in the liver.173Silymarin has been shown in experiments to increase the level of glutathione by 35% more. In human studies, silymarin plays asignificant role in treating liver diseases of various kinds includingcirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, fatty infiltration and inflammation of thebile duct. Therapeutic Dosage 70 to 200 mg, one to three times a day. 4. Resveratrol As discussed in the earlier chapter, Resveratrol (pronounced as rez- VER-a-trawl) is one of a group of natural compounds calledphytoalexins that are produced in plants. Resveratrol is effective against cancers at all three phases of their growth. Its anti-carcinogenic properties are a result of its conversionto piceatannol. When resveratrol is metabolized in the body by thecytochrome P450 enzyme, it creates a metabolite called piceatannol.This is an anti-leukaemic agent. This is how resveratrol can inhibit all three phases of cancer.1. Inducing quinone reductase activity. This is an enzyme that can detoxify carcinogens in phase 2 cancers. It can detoxifycarcinogens, thereby destroying them. 2. Inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase. This is a substance that induces the production of prostaglandins. The latter stimulates tumor growth,suppresses the immune system and activates carcinogens. Inthis way resveratrol controls cancers in phases 1 and 2. Therapeutic Dosage 50 to 500 mg a day.Stopping Cancer Spread174Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 5. Powdered Shark Cartilage Cancers grow and multiply via the development of new blood vessels in phase 3. This process is called angiogenesis as explainedearlier on. Cartilage is a tough and elastic connective tissue. There is no blood supply in cartilage as it contains many anti-angiogenic substances. Shark cartilage is a good example. Long ago, people often wondered why the sharks in the ocean seldom develop cancer. They werevery much intrigued and their curiosity led scientists to embark onvarious studies into it. Experiments were conducted based on thenotion that the shark's body must contain anti-cancer agents. But,which part? The shark is so big. They later found out that it was inthe cartilage. Of course, today, we know that present generationsharks do develop cancer. This may be due to the changingenvironment. Nevertheless, shark cartilage has proven to be a richsource of an anti-angiogenesis agent. It can stop vascular endothelialgrowth factor. This factor stimulates human umbilical endothelialcells in culture that sometimes result in cancer. Since then, the use of shark cartilage has created a lot of controversy and stirred up many emotions. Still, there is no conclusive evidencethat it inhibits angiogenesis in patients with cancer. Therapeutic Dosage It is very important to note that shark cartilage only works in recommended high doses. The recommended dosage is 0.5 to 1 gram per kg of body weight. It is quite a largedose to be taken. To see its full effects, shark cartilage should be consumed for two to four months. Many people have difficulties taking this amount as itresults in nausea. At this high level, the high calcium content in shark175cartilage may aggravate hypercalcemia, which is a serious side effect of cancer. Other side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominalcramps, constipation, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. 6. Liquid Shark Cartilage This is an alternative to the powder form. A 7-cc vial is the same as60 to 80 grams of shark cartilage powder. We can get liquid sharkcartilage in both frozen and non-frozen forms but the frozen form isreported to be more potent. Liquid cartilage prevents the formation of capillaries in a fibrin matrix culture. It also increases vascular permeability of the skin andthe pancreas. In treating cancer, lower doses are required for the first two phases. Do not use liquid cartilage for two to three weeks before surgery and six to eight weeks after surgery so as to allow time for the wounds to heal. Heart disease patients, please avoid this shark cartilage inany form. Children, pregnant women, nursing mothers, body buildersor competitive athletes must also stay clear of them. Some reportedside effects are nausea and vomiting. Shark cartilage is not the same as bovine cartilage. While both have anti-cancer and anti-angiogenic effects, bovine cartilage primarily acts as an immune booster although it has some angiostaticproperties. 7. Bovine Tracheal Cartilage (BTC) The origin of bovine tracheal cartilage (BTC) dates back to the early1950s. Many people have been using it to treat conditions includingcancers, tumors and arthritis ever since.Stopping Cancer Spread176Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine It is a non-toxic material and has demonstrated anti-mitotic, anti- angiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. It was developed bythe aspiring and ambitious Dr John Prudden. He noted that all hissubjects recorded remarkable remissions in pancreatic cancer, breastcancer, and glioblastoma multiforme during a study. The reportedsuccess rate was 90%. Another 61% had complete remission. Suchencouraging results! In this study, both oral and injected forms wereused but the oral form was found to be more effective. The quest to prove the effectiveness of this cartilage has continued. In 1994, another group of doctors conducted a similar study. UsingBTC as a supplement in 35 patients with metastatic renal cellcarcinoma, it was reported that within three months, 22 of the patientshad no relapse of the disease. There were also two patients in stablecondition. This bovine cartilage functions in immune modulation through its polysaccharide components. When these are taken orally, theycan be an immunity boosting and anti-tumor agent. Thesepolysaccharides are also present in maitake mushroom. Therapeutic Dosage 3 to 5 grams daily in powder form in capsules. Take them before meals. This cartilage is much cheaper than shark cartilage. For cancer patients, the requirement may be more at 9 grams a day. We can only see the benefits of this cartilage after a few months.Some reported side effects are gastric upset, fatigue, nausea, fever,dizziness, and edema of the scrotum. 8. Bindweed Earth is full of this weed. Every farmer pretty much regards it as apest. They damage precious crops such as corn and wheat bywrapping themselves around the plants and strangling them.177They are sometimes called \"the cancer of crops\" as they are so much dreaded and feared - just like cancer in human beings. Much as it is hated by farmers, laboratory studies have shown that the proteoglycan mixture found in bindweed is 100 times moreeffective than shark cartilage by weight. Studies in Kansas haveshown that proteoglycan mixture inhibits angiogenesis in chickenegg chorioallantoic membrane tests. So, the nuisance weed has medicinal value and it seems we can never judge something by its outward properties. Bindweed may bea killer to plants but for mankind, it can save lives. In addition to its angiogenesis inhibiting properties, it is also a moderate immune stimulator. Studies performed on this weed's effecton human lymphocyte growth in vitro have reported an increase inlymphocyte production from 35 to 46%. Therapeutic Dosage 1,000 to 3,000 mg per day. Raw bindweed is poisonous. However, the poison is removed during the extractionprocess. We should only take the standardized extract form of thisweed. 9. Collagen-Matrix Reinforcement Cancer cells spread when the nucleus secretes special enzymes.These special enzymes eat their way into the surrounding tissues,thus allowing the cancer cells to penetrate them easily. With theenzyme, cancer cells force their way into smaller vessels.They eat their way through the lumen of the blood vessel and enterthe main blood stream. The blood then transports these cancer cellsto distant organs. This is how secondary tumors commonly occur.Stopping Cancer Spread178Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Collagen is the extracellular structure that the cancer cell must invade when spreading. The more collagen-digesting enzymes producedby the cancer cells, the faster secondary tumors are formed. A strongmatrix will prevent the advance of cancer cells by resisting thedigestive power of these enzymes. We must therefore maintain a strong extracellular collagen matrix to prevent the spread of cancer cells. There are three importantnutrients that help to maintain collagen, namely vitamin C (in theform of ascorbic acid, mineral ascorbates and ascorbyl palmitate),L-lysine, and L-proline. A. Vitamin C Apart from its properties as a strong antioxidant, vitamin C also helps to build a stronger extracellular matrix . This strong collagen matric will protect the healthy cells and guard against the spread of cancercells. As our bodies cannot manufacture vitamin C, supplementa-tion is essential for maintaining our body's collagen. Collagen is replaced by chemical \"bridges\". These chemical bridges are formed by \"OH groups\". They help to anchor amino acids lysineand proline molecules in collagen. In the process, vitamin C is actuallydestroyed and used. The more collagen we wish to form, the morevitamin C has to be available. We can see that vitamin C is an important foundation of natural cancer therapy. Ascorbyl palmitate should be used as a supplementin conjunction with vitamin C (ascorbic acid). The former is a fat-soluble form that can be retained in the body much longer than itswater-soluble counterpart. Its potency is therefore many times higherthan simple vitamin C. Since large doses of vitamin C are normallyneeded, some people may develop gastric irritation. Taking vitaminC in the form of mineral ascorbates will often bypass this problem.179In the words of Dr Linus Pauling, the father of vitamin C therapy and two time Nobel laureate, If the megavitamin treatment were to be started at the time of first diagnosis of cancer, as an adjunct to appropriate conventionaltherapy, the cancer death rate could be reduced by 25% of itspresent value, and moreover, if in the course of time, a reasonablemegavitamin regimen were to be followed regularly by every person,as a way of improving health and decreasing the incidence of cancerand other diseases, the cancer death rate would fall to one eighth ofits present value. Therapeutic Dosage 3-15 grams a day for the collagen building purpose. B. L-Lysine This is an amino acid that our body cannot produce. It is vital forforming collagen fibers and works together with vitamin C to form astrong collagen extracellular matrix to prevent cancer cells fromspreading. L-Lysine is supplied through either our diet or from dietarysupplements. Therapeutic Dosage 2-5 grams a day. C. L-Proline L-Proline is another amino acid that is also an important component of collagen. Our bodies can produce L-proline but the amount islimited. Cancer patients will deplete their bodies' production in notime. Supplementation is required to ensure that the collagenmatrix is strong and not easily penetrated by the collagen-digesting enzymes. Therapeutic Dosage 1-2 grams a day.Stopping Cancer Spread180Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 10. Artemisinin (Wormwood) - From Malaria to Cancer Many marvels of modern medicine are discovered by accident. Some of these include: - 1. The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming. 2. The use of saw palmetto to prevent benign prostate enlargement.3. Digoxin to enhance cardiac function.4. Gingko to reduce vascular viscosity and increase blood flow. Recently, another ancient herb called artemisinin was discovered. History documentation showed that it was used to treat intestinal parasitic infections, hemorrhoids (its an anti-inflammatory) andmalaria as early as 2000 years ago. The Use for Malaria This treatment for malaria was, however, lost over time. It was onlyrediscovered in an archeological dig in the 1970s where its medicinaluse was found in a recipe inside a tomb. The formula was datedback to 168 B.C. where the Chinese chemist isolated the primaryactive ingredient from the leafy portion of plant called A. annua L. In 1972, scientists in the West called this crystalline compound \"qinghaosu\" or \"artemisinin\". Since then, studies in China andVietnam have confirmed that artemisinin is a highly effective compound with close to 100 percent response rate for treatingmalaria. It has the ability to destroy the malaria parasite by releasinghigh doses of free radicals that attack the cell membrane of theparasite in the presence of high iron concentration. In fact, over onemillion malaria patients have been cured via this method.Their symptoms also subsided in a matter of days. However, the treatment using this herb to treat malaria is not approved for use in the U.S.A due to the concern that it has a 21181percent recrudescent rate. Scientists believe that this is more likely due to patients not taking the compound for a long period. Many ofthem actually stop taking it as soon as their symptoms subside. Artemisinin comes in a few derivatives, including the oil soluble artemether, which has been found to induce neurotoxic symptomsin animals in high dose (but not reported in humans). For those whoare technically inclined, the activities of all artemisinin derivativesare dependent on their internal endoperoxide bridge. It is thereforea close relative of hydrogen peroxide therapy. While the exactmechanism is still under intense research, it has been shown thatthis herb works via highly reactive oxygen-based free radicals thatbecomes activated in the presence of iron. Iron is an oxidant, andour body tries to protect us from excessive iron moving it to a bindedstate such as hemoglobin and enzymes. The malaria parasiteaccumulates iron by infecting iron-rich red blood cell. Excessive ironthat is spilled onto the surrounding tissues will activate the artemisininto generate a burst of free radicals that attack the iron rich cells,killing the parasite in the process. In other words, this compound works well in an iron rich environment (remember that malaria lives in the red blood cell rich in iron) throughthe release of free radicals that serve to damage the malariaorganism. It is also interesting to note that drugs known to work byenhancing oxygen radical effects such as doxorubicin can enhancethe effects of artemisinin. For malaria, there is no resistance nor toxicity at the dosage of 3 grams, (about 50mg/kg) administered over a 3 to 5 day period. It isespecially useful in the treatment of drug resistant malaria. Outside of the United States, artemisinin is the number one natural herb used for malaria treatment.Stopping Cancer Spread182Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine The Use for Cancer So far, the most extensive study on the use of Artemisinin as an anti- cancer agent was carried out by bioengineering scientistsDrs Narenda Singh and Henry Lai of the University of Washington.This study was reported in the Journal Life Science (70 (2001): 49-56). Iron is required for cell division, and it is well known that many cancer cell types selectively accumulate iron for this purpose. Most cancershave large number of iron attracting transferring receptors on theircell surface compared to normal cells. In laboratory studies ofradiation, resistant breast cancer cells that has high propensity foraccumulating iron revealed that artemisinin has 75 percent cancercell killing properties in a 8 hours and almost 100 percent killingproperties within 24 hours when these cancer cells are \"pre-loaded\"with iron after incubation with holotransferrin. On the other hand,the normal cells remained virtually unharmed. Another study showingthe effectiveness of artesunate in treatment of cancer was alsopublished in Oncology (April 2001: 18(4): 767-73). The fact that iron content of cancer cells is high has also been used in another anti-cancer therapy called Zoetron therapy, where ironcontaining cancer cells are induced into motion using a magneticdevice to induce resonance. Resonance generate heat. Cancer cellsare more sensitive to heat compared to normal healthy cells. Whencancer cells are heated to a certain temperature, they die whilenormal cells still survive. Artemisinin is effective against a wide variety of cancers as shown in a series of successful experiments. The most effective is leukemiaand colon cancer. Intermediate activities were also shown againstmelanoma, breast, ovarian, prostate, CNS and renal cancer. Althoughartemisinin is insoluble in water, it is able to cross the blood brainbarrier (the water soluble artesunate is the weakness among the183derivates) and may be particularly suitable for curing brain tumors, together with Poly-MVA (an metalo-vitamin) In laboratory studies, iron needs to be added to enhance the effects of artemisinin. Within the human body, no such addition is necessary,as iron already exist in the body. It can also be taken orally andtherefore high doses are not required. Some people believe that asnitrogen (tertiary amine) is absent in ART, cancer cells cannot getrid of it once it enters into the cancer cell. As a result, ART stays inthe cell much longer. In addition to the high affinity for iron in aggressive cancer cell types, most cancer cells also lack the enzyme catalayse and gutathioneperoxidase. Catalayse breaks down hydrogen peroxide. A lowcatalayse content means a higher hydrogen peroxide load, whichcan release superoxide free radicals when properly stimulated to doso. This is in fact one common mechanism among chemotherapeuticagents as well as vitamin C. These traits make cancer cells moresusceptible to oxidative damage as compare to normal cells in thepresences of hydrogen peroxide. For this reason, concurrentadministration of vitamin C in high dose is suggested. According to Dr Rowen, a naturally oriented medical doctor and editor of the medical newsletter \" Second Opinion \" , the Hoang family of physicians in Vietnam had used arteminisin in the treatment of cancerfor years. They have reported that, over a 10-year period, more than400 patients were treated with artemisinin in conjunction with acomprehensive anti-cancer program with 50 to 60 percent long-termremission rate. The safety record of artemisinin has well been studiedfor over 25 years. No significant toxicity in short-term use for malariaat high dose of up to 70 mg/kg per day has been reported. Artemisinin is not a stand-alone chemotherapeutic agent. A combination of nutritional supplements (such as green tea, CoQ10and pancreatic enzyme) as well as a good anti-cancer diet is required.Stopping Cancer Spread184Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine ART may be administered orally, with a 32 percent bioavailability as compared to injections. It is highly bound to membranes. Laboratorymeasurement of its serum level is therefore not exact. Forms of Artesminin There are three common forms of artemsinin. The water solubleform is called artesunate . It is the most active and the least toxic. Italso has the shortest life within the body Artemether is the lipid solubleform. It has the longest life but also the most toxic in high dosagethat is seldom needed. The biggest advantage of artemether is thatit can cross the blood brain barrier. Artemisinin is the active parentcompound of the plant. It's half-life is intermediate. It is also verysafe, and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Some clinicians preferto use a combination of all three forms, while others tend to favorthe use of artemisinin alone with great success. Toxicity and Side Effects High doses of artemisinin can produce neurotoxicity such as gait disturbances, loss of spinal and pain response, respiratorydepression, and ultimately cardiopulmonary arrest in large animals. In human beings, there are very few reports of adverse effects except for one case of first-degree heart block. According to Robert Rowen,MD, there is a dose related decrease in reticulocyte count for 4 daysafter artesunate or artemether at doses of 4 mg/kg per day for 3days. However, the count returns to normal by day 14. Whenartemisinin suppositories are used, doses as high as 40 mg/kg perday have no effects on the reticulocyte count. In a study, it wasreported that up to 35 percent of the volunteers had some form oftransient drug induced fever.185When ART is tested with monkeys, they showed no toxicity when they received up to 292 mg/kg of artemether over 1 to 3 months.This is equal to a human dose of 20,000 mg for a 70 kg male (Journalof Traditional Chinese Medicine 2(1):31-36 1982). In another study,there was also no sign of toxicity in over 4000 patients. This doesnot exclude possible cases of long-term cumulative toxicity which isunknown at this time. Cautions A.No artesminin should be taken within 30 days of radiation therapy because of possible free iron leaks to the surrounding tissuesafter radiation therapy. B. Preliminary laboratory studies include: CBC, reticulocyte count, liver function test, ferritin, TIBC, ESR, C reactive protein, andappropriate tumor markers. If the iron load is low, supplementingiron for a few days can be considered prior to starting artemisinin. C. Tumor markers may increase during the initial stages as the tumor starts breaking down. D. Vitamin E may work against the effectiveness of ART in vitro. However, this has not been shown to be a concern in humanclinical cases. Dosage The therapeutic dose ranges from 200 mg a day (for cancer inremission) up to 1,000 a day (in divided doses 4 times a day) forthose with active cancer. Some doctors are recommending up to1,600 mg per day based on a 100 pounds, 5 feet 2 inches tall female. Artemisinin should always be taken with food. Cod liver oil may be administered at the same time to enhance absorption. Generally,Stopping Cancer Spread186Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 400 to 800 mg per day can be used for at least 6 to 12 months. After that, it can be tapered off slowly. Artemisinin is a \"cooling herb\" in the traditional Chinese medicine perspective, and some may find it too \"cooling\" with symptoms suchas tingling. If this occurs, then the dosage should be reduced. Despite its seemingly high degree of effectiveness, it is important to note that artemisinin is not a stand-alone compound. Concurrentuse of high dose pancreatic enzymes, daily enema, liverdetoxification, and periodic laboratory measurement should also beconsidered as part of an overall aggressive anti-cancer program. Product Concerns Due to the increasing popularity of this product, the consumer shouldexercise extreme caution and buy only from the most reputablesupplier. Only genuine and pure artemisinin should be used, andonly buy from sources you are familiar with. Since the herb comes from China and South-east Asia, proper quality assurance on purity and standardization is of tremendousimportance. High-grade artemisinin must always be confirmed byindependent laboratory analysis on a batch-by-batch basis to ensureconsistence and purity.187/fl1rtCHAPTER EIGHT BALANCED INTERNAL TERRAIN \"The microbe is nothing, the terrain is everything.\" Louis Pasteur, Father of Modern Pathology. 188Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Our internal biological terrain determines the environment in which cancer cells exist. The two components of an optimum terrain are a balanced acid/base environment and balancedintestinal flora. An acidic environment helps cancer to grow, while an alkaline environment deters cancer growth. This terrain is also influenced bythe amount of friendly or unfriendly bacteria present and the transittime for food passing through the gut. Clearly we must maintain astrong and healthy biological terrain to prevent the growth ofcancer cells. Let us examine these two main components in more detail: ACIDITY - ALKALINITY (PH) According to the research of Dr Enderlein, our bodies can only be healed of any chronic illness when our blood is at a normal, or slightly alkaline pH. What exactly does pH mean? pH is the short form for potential hydrogen. The pH of any solution is the measure of its hydrogen-ionconcentration. The higher the pH reading, the more alkaline andoxygen-rich the fluid is. The lower the pH reading, the more acidicand oxygen-deprived the fluid is. The pH ranges from 0 to 14, with7.0 being neutral. Indications above 7.0 are alkaline and below 7.0are considered acidic. The pH indicators are an exponent number of 10. A small difference in pH will translate to a big difference in the number of oxygen orOH-ions. A difference of 1 in a pH value means ten times the difference in the number of OH-ions . A difference of 2 means one hundred times the difference in the number of OH-ions.189Balanced Internal Terrain In other words, a blood with a pH value of 7.45 contains 64.9% more oxygen than blood with a pH value of 7.30. Our blood pH has a very narrow range of around 7.35 to 7.45. If our body's pH deviates from this range, we will be sick or have symptomsof falling sick. If our blood pH falls below 6.8 or above 7.8, our bodycells will stop functioning and death will occur. Only when the pHlevel is balanced can our bodies effectively assimilate vitamins,minerals and food supplements. As such, our body's pH determinesgood health. What then happens when the body is too acidic? An acidic environment will: 1. Decrease the body's ability to absorb minerals and other nutrients. 2. Decrease energy production in the cells.3. Decrease the body's ability to repair damaged cells.4. Decrease the body's ability to detoxify heavy metals.5. Enable tumor cells to thrive.6. Make the body more susceptible to fatigue and illness. Two main factors leading to cancer are an acidic pH and a lack of oxygen. As such, are we able to manipulate these two factors so asto prevent and control cancer? The vast majority of terminal cancer patients have a very acidic pH. Research has proven that terminal cancer patients often have anacidity level 1,000 times more than normal healthy people. Why isthis so? The reason is simple. Without oxygen, glucose undergoing fermentation becomes lactic acid. this causes the pH of the cell todrop. In more advance cancer cases, the pH level can even falllover to 6.0 or lower. The basic truth is that our bodies simply cannotfight diseases if our pH is not properly balanced.190Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine The normal human cell is slightly alkaline and has an abundance of molecular oxygen. The cancer cell is acidic and cannot survive in anoxygen rich environment. How to Test Your pH Level 1. Salivary pH Test Just wet a piece of litmus paper with your saliva 2 hours after a mealand match it against the color scale. This will give you a reflection ofyour state of health. Although saliva is generally more acidic thanblood, it is a fairly good indicator of health. It tells you what yourbody retains. Salivary pH is a fair indicator of health for extracellularfluids and their alkaline mineral reserves. The optimal pH for saliva is between 6.4 to 6.8. A reading lower than 6.4 means that there is not enough alkaline reserves. After meals, the saliva pH should rise to 7.8 or higher. If there is noincrease, it will imply that the body has a deficiency in alkalineminerals especially calcium and magnesium. Food will not be absorbed and assimilated well. To deviate from an ideal salivary pHfor an extended time will lead to illnesses. If the salivary pH level remains too low, we should take more fruits, vegetables and mineral water and avoid strongacidifiers such as sodas, whole wheat and red meat tomaintain its balance. 2. Urinary pH Test The pH of the urine is an indication of how well the body is working to maintain a proper pH of the blood. It reflects the efforts of thebody via the kidneys, adrenals, lungs and gonads through the buffersalts and hormones. The urine also shows the alkaline building(anabolic) and acid tearing down (catabolic) cycles. By taking urine191samples, we can get a fairly accurate picture of our body pH as our kidneys filter out the buffer salts of pH regulation. The same litmustest can provide blood pH estimates based on what the body iseliminating. The urine pH can vary from around 4.5 to 9.0, but theideal range is still 5.8 to 6.8. To increase the alkalinity in our blood, we can consume these foods: almonds, aloe vera, apples, apricots, bee pollen, buckwheat,cabbage, cantaloupe, carrots, cucumbers, dates, pulse, figs,grapefruit, honey, lettuce, millet, parsley, raisins, peaches, pineapple,soy products, sprouted seeds, cooked spinach, turnip tops, wakamemiso soup, azuki beans and mineral water. INTESTINAL FLORA Do you know that good gastrointestinal health is possible only whengood and bad bacteria are in balance? Both types of bacteria areneeded for normal bowel functions; an ef ficient digestive system can prevent carcinogenic toxins from building up. Probiotics are good bacteria. Many scientists believe that diseases are caused by toxin secretion from pathogens and not the pathogensthemselves. Today, this hypothesis has been proven true. Toxinsfrom infectious bacteria, fungi and viruses cause cancer. Forexample, human papilloma virus causes cervical cancer, H. pylori causes stomach cancer, hepatitis causes liver cancer and HIV virusleads to Kaposi sarcoma. In the case of some liver cancers, thesecretion responsible is called aflatoxin, found in peanuts. On the other hand, approximately 400 types of good bacteria live in the intestines. Their total population is about 100 times more thanthe number of cells in our bodies. Their numbers are huge but theylive together in harmony. They act like security guards by guardingthe intestines and preventing bad bacteria and fungi from gettingBalanced Internal Terrain192Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine out of hand. Such good bacteria help to keep our bodies healthy and fit. When enemies attack, this ideal environment is disrupted. Then, bad bacteria, parasites and fungi such as clostridia , salmonella , staphylococcus , blastocystis hominis and candida albicans will proliferate in the intestines. They will start to multiply and attack thegood bacteria. War is therefore inevitable. Apart from the good bacteria's ability to guard our bodies from enemies, they also produce vitamins such as biotin, folic acid, niacin,pantothenic acid, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamins B6, B12 and K. Thesebacteria help to break down proteins into amino acids. Amino acidsare then reconfigured into new proteins that are useful for the body.Good bacteria also ensure that toxins are excreted from the bowelsinstead of being absorbed into the bloodstream. We now focus on four groups of compounds that can help to provide an idealbiological terrain in our bodies. They are digestive enzymes,probiotics, green foods and fiber. 1. Digestive Enzymes Our bodies contain more than 1,300 different types of enzymes. Theseenzymes act like construction workers building and maintaining oursystem. They are properly called molecule catalysts. Enzymes come in several forms. They can be found in raw fruits and vegetables that are not very tasty to many of us. Cooking andfood processing may improve the taste but they will destroy theseimportant enzymes. Enzymes are destroyed when heated to 160 \u00b0F. The body's ability to digest food, deliver up the nutrients and optimizebodily functions would be affected. Toxins will then begin to build upand accumulate in the body.193Digestive enzyme supplements are important when our body's natural supply is exhausted. Plant enzymes help in the digestion offood in the intestines and prevent a big bloated tummy after a bigmeal. Every day, our consumption of food totals approximately twopounds. For all these to be digested, we need a smooth passage offood through the gastrointestinal tract to avoid stasis of feces. Thisis where the digestive enzymes play an important role together witha high-fiber diet. Digestive enzymes also help other vitamins and minerals. For example, the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K need fat forabsorption. Fat has to be broken down by an enzyme known aslipase so that vitamins can be released. Consuming vitamin-richfood will be a waste of precious time and money if there are noproper enzymes to break down and release the vitamins into thebody system. In a cancer setting the use of digestive enzymes is critical. The relevant functions of these enzymes are: To attack the coating on tumor cells which disguise them from recognition by the immune system. To stimulate various components of the immune system such as natural killer cells, T-cells and tumor necrosis factor. To remove the \"sticky\" coating on cancer cells that allow them to attach themselves to other parts of the body. It preventscancer spread. To penetrate cancer cells during their reproductive phase when they are not yet fully formed and to destroy them. To help ensure that large and potential allergy-triggering food particles do not enter the blood circulation through a leaky gut. To reduce the acidity of the internal terrain.Balanced Internal Terrain194Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Therapeutic Dosage 1 tablet 3 to 4 times a day and then subsequently increasing to 5 tablets 4 times a day foradvance cancers. 2. Probiotics Probiotics are good bacteria as we previously stated. An excellentexample of a good bacterium is acidophilus . Acidophilus stimulates activity in the thymus and spleen and prompt our bodies to producenatural antibodies. Some acidophilus strains also protect the body against cancers by helping to promote production of interferon, ahormone that protects against cancer. Probiotics such as acidophilus also secrete mediators so that bad bacteria cannot grow. However, when the micro-organic forms takeover, they will exclude the probiotics with their toxins. We can preventthis situation from arising through keeping our bowels healthy bypopulating it with probiotics. Probiotics that contain lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidus can aid in our body's detoxification program, for example. In extensive and sophisticated studies conducted to assess the effectiveness of probiotics, the following have been concluded. 1. Probiotics can improve bowel transit time and the texture of the fecal matter. 2. It reduces lactose intolerance caused by a deficiency of lactase. The latter causes gas formation and bloating or stomachdiscomfort after milk consumption. 3. Probiotics can act as an anti-toxin with anti-carcinogenic and anti-tumor agents. 4.It helps to relieve dermatitis and other skin problems by improving gastrointestinal bacteria balance.195In addition to the above benefits, probiotics can also help to destroy toxins in other parts of the body besides the intestines. It is so strongthat it can get rid of bad bacteria and fungi that produce their owntoxins. Probiotics helps to minimize the risk of colon cancer, protectsthe whole body and improves general well-being. Therapeutic Dosage Take probiotics such as acidophilus so as to repopulate our intestinal tract with good bacteria. At least 5 billionper serving, 2-4 times a day. Acidophilus supplements can be purchased in health and drugstores. When purchasing, select onethat contain either lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus bulgaricus or streptococcus faecium. All these are good bacteria. Do ensure that all purchases are fesh and well within theexpiry date. These supplements are to be refrigerated. Any leftoversare to be thrown away after more than six months. Always consumethose with the highest potency. 3. Green Foods Green foods contain three algae and two cereal grasses. The algaeare chlorella , spirulina and green blue algae. The grasses are wheat and barley grass. Green food is generally highly nutritious andchlorella is the most effective among the green food. They help to alkalinize the body and prevent cancer growth. Chlorella is single-celled fresh water green algae that contain amino acids, enzymes, vitamins, minerals and carbohydrates. Chlorella is not only a self-contained whole food but also a complete proteinsource. It contains 18 of the 22 known amino acids including theeight essential amino acids. Chlorella contains 50 to 60% proteins. Some other green foods also contain proteins. Their percentage of proteins is 73% in spirulina , 56% in blue green algae, 14% in barley grass and 18% in wheatgrass. As such, chlorella contains a considerable proportion ofBalanced Internal Terrain196Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine proteins when compared with other green foods. It also has the highest concentration of chlorophyll in any plant. It has 5 to 10 timesmore than spirulina , wheat and barley grass. It is also higher in chlorophyll than the blue green algae. Chlorophyll is a powerfulcleanser and detoxifier for the body. Chlorella has been known to combat cancer. We will now look at some of its cancer-fighting properties. Chlorella stimulates interferon production. The latter is our body's natural immunity against cancer. Chlorella 's tough cell wall makes it a superior nutrient when comparing with otheralgae or grasses. Its cell wall can eliminate toxins, pesticidesand heavy metals from the body. Chlorella growth factor is present in the nucleus. It enhances resistance to abdominal cancers by increasing the number ofimmune cells in the abdominal cavity. In studies where micewere fed chlorella , their life span was increased by over 30%. Chlorella increases T-Cells and B-Cells lymphocytes. White blood cell count is often improved. Chlorella helps to revitalize the body after chemotherapy. The patient is therefore less tired. Notwithstanding its potency, chlorella does not enjoy celebrity status. Many people find it difficult to take chlorella on its own. In this case, they may wish to mix chlorella with vegetable juice or water andtake it together with meals. However, do note that chlorella should not be mixed with fruit juice. Fruit juices are usually high in sugarcontent and lacks fiber. Therapeutic Dosage To prevent cancer, 3 grams a day is recommended. Higher dosage at 10 to 30 grams a day isrecommended for advance cancers. Chlorella can be taken at any time of the day. It can be taken all at once or in divided dosagesthroughout the day. So far, there is no known toxic dose. A word of197caution, since chlorella is a whole food, taking too much may not be good because of its detoxifying abilities leading tosudden toxic release. When chlorella is taken for the very first time, some people may experience cleansing reactions in the form of gas, cramping,constipation or diarrhea. Some may feel a \"toxic release\" sensationduring the initial course. As such, very sensitive people may wish tobegin with as little as 300 mg a day and gradually increasing thedose by 500 mg every 3 to 5 days. 4. Fiber The average American's diet is very low in fiber. Many believe this isa key causative factor of colon cancer. We need to consume at least25 to 30 grams daily for healthy bowel function. The consumption inAmericans is reported to be only 5 to 15 grams a day. Clearly, this isnot enough. What's the solution then? Very simple. They can increase their fiber level by taking half a cup of bran, one cup of legume, two cups ofvegetables, three fruits, whole grain bread and cereals on a dailybasis. If they are fussy eaters, fiber supplementation together withdigestive enzymes and drinking more water will also perform thesame functions. These supplements are to be taken one hour beforea meal so as not to interfere with the absorption of nutrients inthe diet. Fiber comes in two forms. They are soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibers are found in fruits, oat bran, legumes, apple pectinand guar gum. Psyllium is an example that can be taken to control cholesterol. Insoluble fibers are found in vegetables and whole grain products such as wheat bran. They assist in speeding food through theBalanced Internal Terrain198Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine intestines. As such, the intestinal lining's exposure to food that may cause cancer is very much lessened. Cancer is prevented inthis way. Fiber can enhance good bacteria and reduce acidity in the digestive system, thus reducing the production of carcinogens. It is importantto remember to drink plenty of water when taking soluble or insoluble fiber. Therapeutic Dosage 15 to 35 grams of fiber a day to enhance digestive health and promote a smooth transit of food duringdigestion. Modified citrus pectin is a form of fiber that provides addedprotection to stop the spread of cancer cells. A compound calledrhamnogalacturonan found in modified citrus pectin has a \"bridgingeffect\" that enhances the cytotoxic ability of T-lymphocytes. 15 gramsa day is recommended.199/fl1rt\"The cleansing of toxins and waste products will restore optimium function and vitality.\" Elson Haas, MD, director of the Marin Clinic of Preventive Medicine and Health Education, in The Definitive Guide to CancerCHAPTER NINE UNLOAD YOUR TOXINS 200Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Exposure to an ever increasing array of toxic carcinogens in our air, food and water results in the production of cancer cells within the body. When our internal clearing system is unable to unloadthe toxin and the abnormal cells when they are few in number, cancercan result. The more toxins you have in your body, the faster will bethe mutation of your healthy cells and the faster cancer will form. One way of overcoming this problem is to identify ways of getting rid of these toxins from our bodies as early as possible. Detoxification of the body means the cleansing of the bowels, kidneys, lungs, liver and blood. These are the vital organs that areinvolved in the elimination of chemicals and toxins from the body.Cancer stricken patients usually need intensive detoxification forseveral reasons. In the first place, their immune system succumbedto cancerous cells because of a highly toxic body at the onset. Thenthis toxicity is further compounded by the adverse effects of the toxinsproduced by the therapies used by conventional oncologists suchas chemotherapy. Is there any wonder why cancer patients are oftenmore sick than cured? Most alternative cancer physicians believe that it is essential to flush all the toxins out of the body through major dietary changes and amultifaceted detoxification program that \"cleans\" the liver, kidney,lung, lymph, and skin. Let us look at it more closely.201Unload Your Toxins DEFINITION OF TOXINS A toxin is defined as any compound that has a detrimental effect on cell function or structure. Toxins can damage the body in an unseen and cumulative way. Toxic metabolites are formed when the body's internal detoxification system is overloaded. At this point, our bodies become more sensitiveto other chemicals, some of which are normally not toxic. It is thisaccumulation of toxins over a period of time that can weaken ourmetabolic processes and result in a number of allergies and diseases. Toxins are found in industrial chemicals, industrial wastes, pesticides, additives in our foods, heavy metals, anesthetics, drug residues,environmental hormones, and even secondary cigarette smoke.There are altogether two million synthetic substances and 25,000new toxins are added each year. This means that the world isbecoming more and more toxic at a really alarming rate! When we are exposed to toxins for a long time, our body cells are affected. The toxins are carcinogenic as they alter human DNA. Eventhe World Health Organization has identified the problem and itblames environmental toxic chemicals for causing the cancer andmuch havoc in our surroundings. TYPES OF TOXINS The types of toxins are classified into the following categories: 1. Toxic metals 2. Liver toxins3. Microbial toxins4. Protein by-product toxins202Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 1. Toxic Metals Toxic metals including lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, nickel and aluminum are most likely to accumulate in the brain, kidneys andimmune system. About 25% of the US population suffers from heavy metal poisoning. Believe it or not, every year, over 600,000 tons of lead are released into the environment from industrial processes andleaded gasoline. The toxins are either inhaled or ingested after beingabsorbed into food crops, fresh water and soil. Other sources of toxic metals are from pesticide sprays, cadmium batteries, cigarette smoke, mercury in dental fillings, contaminatedfish, aluminum from antacids, cookware and soda cans. The level of toxins in our bodies can be assessed by a blood analysis of the actual toxin level of each metal within the red blood cell. Manytoxic metals have a tendency to accumulate inside the cell, wheremost of the damage is done. The commonly used measures ofextracellular serum toxic metal levels are therefore seldom accurate. Toxic metals cause Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and severe neurological disorders. If you are poisoned by heavy metals,chances are that you will suffer from headaches, fatigue, musclepain, indigestion, constipation, anemia, and tremors. Mild toxicitysymptoms include impaired memory and distorted thinking. You caneven die of severe metal poisoning. We can rectify the above problem by using chelation therapy to bind toxic metals, or taking high potency vitamin and mineral supplementsincluding vitamins C and B complex and sulfur-containing aminoacids. We must also increase our intake of high sulfur-content food203such as garlic, onion, eggs, guar gum, oat bran, pectin and psyllium seeds. 2. Liver Toxins Our liver is the major detoxification center of the body. It filtersunwanted substances and wastes from the blood and gets rid oftoxins such as alcohol, solvents, formaldehyde, pesticides, herbicidesand food additives. The liver can also reduce toxins to compoundsthat can be safely removed via the kidney as urine, the skin as sweat,the lungs as expelled air and the bowels as feces. As the liver playssuch an important function, we must ensure it remains healthy. The symptoms of heavy metal poisoning in the liver include psychological and neurological conditions manifested as depression,headache, confusion, mental illness, abnormal nerve reflexes andtremor in the hands. To detoxify the liver, we can take compounds such as milk thistle extract, choline, methionine and antioxidants. 3. Microbial Toxins As stated earlier, there are good and bad microbes in our system.The bad ones secrete harmful substances. So how do you preventyour intestines from absorbing toxins that will lead to disastrouseffects in your body? Some of these toxins include endotoxins and exotoxins from bacteria, toxic amines, toxic derivatives from bile and many other carcinogens.When the intestines absorb these toxins, you might developconditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, disease,psoriasis, lupus, pancreatitis, allergies, asthma and immunedisorders.Unload Your Toxins204Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine When antibodies are formed against antigens, they can \"cross-react\" with the body's cells. This causes auto-immune diseases suchas rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes and auto-immune thyroiditis. Take more soluble fibers such as those found in fruits, guar gum, pectin and oat bran to solve this problem. Fiber can help to eliminatetoxins from the intestines and promote their excretion. 4. Protein By-product Toxins Our kidney is the other key player responsible for the eliminationof toxic waste products such as ammonia and urea from proteinbreakdown. Detoxification of the body involves cleansing the kidney with plenty of water. Water is often regarded as the fountain of life. So, take more of it if you wish to live longer. Have at least 8 to 10 glasses offiltered water a day. Cut down on meats, dairy products and other proteins and this will prevent overloading the body with urea which is a waste productthat should be gotten rid of. DO WE NEED DETOXIFICATION? As long as we are on this earth, we will not be able to find a safehaven free from toxins and pollutants. The air that we breathe ispolluted, the water that we drink is full of chlorine and the clothingwe wear is made from artificial fabrics and chemicals. In everyhousehold, the lotions, cleaning detergents, soaps and shampoosall contain toxic chemicals. Many of us are not even aware that theseproducts contain harmful toxins. When we absorb these chemicals,205be it directly or indirectly, we can never eliminate them fully unless we undergo a detoxification process. Everybody needs some formof detoxification. It is the only way to survive this polluted andtoxic environment. Our bodies are created to be self-cleansing and self-healing. The internal detoxification process is an automatic daily routine via themajor detoxification organs. Today, our toxic environment isoverloading our detoxification system. So health-consciousindividuals are choosing detoxification processes to maintaintheir bodies. Detoxification is a key component in any comprehensive cancer program. In a cancer setting, an intensive detoxification programusually requires three to four weeks of intravenous solutions, dietadjustments and enemas. It is very effective and many spontaneouscancers have been controlled by detoxification alone. Benefits of Detoxification These are some of the benefits of detoxifications: 1.The digestive tract is cleansed of accumulated waste and fermenting bacteria. 2. Liver, kidney and blood purification can take place. The natural purification process would have been compromised by the toxins. 3. Mental clarity is enhanced as chemicals and food additives are eliminated. 4. The dependency on sugar, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and drugs is reduced. 5. The immune system is stimulated.Unload Your Toxins206Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine PRINCIPLES OF A DETOXIFICATION PROGRAM There are three basic principles of a detoxification program. 1. Cleansing 2. Rebuilding3. Maintenance 1. Cleansing There are many forms of cleansing. Cleansing of the body systemcan be achieved internally through fasting and externally throughskin cleansing. The other ways are vegetable juicing, colon cleansing,kidney cleansing, lung cleansing and toxic metal cleansing. Thesewill be examined in detail below. In some cases, enemas are usedbut they are normally reserved for cases where intense cleansing isrequired. A. Complete Fasting Complete fasting is not recommended for the cancer patient unless the patient is in remission and in good health. The reason is simple,the cancer patient needs all the good nutrition he or she can get.While a complete fast is a wonderful way to detoxify, we do not wantthe detoxification process to further weaken the body that is alreadysuffering from the toxic drugs and chemotherapeutic agents onboard. B. Vegetable Juicing The vegetable juice fast is an effective form of cleansing.Vegetable juices are excellent sources of vitamins, minerals and enzymes.207This is also an excellent form of detoxification for cancer patients. They should benefit from a high dose of vegetable juices for theirnutrition and antioxidant effects. However, the cancer patient shouldexercise caution when undergoing this form of fasting. They shouldbe under supervision by their doctor. Fruit and vegetable juices are a world apart. Although vegetable juices are one of the most unappreciated choices, they actuallycontain good sources of antioxidants and enzymes needed for toxincleansing and excretion. They are easy to digest, nutritious and helpto get rid of indigestion. Certain vegetables should be taken in small amounts due to their high sugar content. Carrots and beetroots, for example fall into this category. They increase the blood sugar level considerably. As vegetable juices do not taste as nice as fruit juices,small amounts like one or two ounces each time, may be drunkinitially. This amount should be gradually increased to 12 ounceswithout causing any nausea or belching. Whole vegetables should also be taken together with the vegetable juices or after the drink. This is important because the chewing motionof eating vegetables will stimulate gastric juice secretion and promotedigestion. The best part of the juice is the pulp. It provides bulk and fiber to our diet and aids bowel movements. The only drawback is that it doesnot taste too good. We can try mixing a small amount into the juicefirst and then gradually increasing it when we are used to the taste.Not many people can consume all the pulp with the juice. It is quitethick and will probably look like a bowl of porridge instead of a glassof juice.Unload Your Toxins208Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Vegetable juice should be consumed immediately as its nutrients are very perishable. As far as possible do not keep it for more than24 hours. For storing vegetable juice, use a glass jar with an airtightlid. Fill the juice to the brim to minimize air space because oxygen inthe air pocket will oxidize and damage the juice. Thereafter, wrapthe jar with aluminum foil to block out all light and then store it in therefrigerator. Remove the juice from the refrigerator 30 minutes beforedrinking so as to allow it to be consumed at room temperature. Beginners may wish to start with juicing celery, fennel (anise) and cucumbers. This combination tastes rather good. Later, they can bemotivated to include other vegetables and herbs such as spinach,cabbage, bok choy, endive, lettuce, parsley and cilantro. should consider collard green, dandelion green andmustard green as these vegetables are very beneficial. They tastebitter but they are good for you. Sometimes, a little carrot and beetroot can be added to these bitter juices. However, the amount should be minimal as they are higherin sugar content when compared with their green leafy counterparts.Try adding a little lemon juice as it is a strong blood alkalizer. When alkalinity is raised in the blood stream, calcium ion is reduced. Thisis good because calcium ion enhances tumor growth. Cancer patients should minimize their intake of fruit juices and take more vegetable juices. Fruit juices contain too much sugar and thiswill increase the patient's blood sugar and insulin levels. Remembercancer cells thrive in a sugar environment. If fruit juice has to betaken, then it should be diluted with water. C. Skin Cleanse Sweating helps to release toxins from our bodies. As our skin is oneof the most effective excretion organs, a detoxification program209emphasizing skin cleansing is essential. Our sweat glands team up with our kidneys to effectively perform the detoxification. Good skin care is important. Many of us do not know that \"skin care\" products such as soaps and shampoos contain deadly syntheticchemicals. Unknowingly, we are being poisoned as we bathe, asmore toxins are absorbed into our bodies. We are not aware of thedangers that we can't see so long as our liver is able to metabolizethese toxins. To avoid being poisoned, consider switching to naturalsoaps and shampoos. These contain no toxins and chemicals. Exercise, sauna, skin brushing and detoxification baths can remove such toxins. Let us take a closer look at these methods. i. Skin Brushing Keep brushing your skin to remove the outer dead skin layers andkeep your pores open! After bathing, we can try using the towel togive our skin a good scrub until it is slightly red. Do note that thesetowels will have to be changed regularly as they may contain toxinsfrom the scrubbing. ii. Sauna Bath These very popular methods are excellent ways of removing toxinsfrom the skin. They also rejuvenate our health and energy level. It isgood to go into the sauna after dry skin brushing as the intense heatencourages excessive sweating and removes toxins in the process.Regular sauna treatment is an excellent detoxification tool, especiallyfor the cancer patient for the simple reason that cancer cells do nothandle heat as well as regular cells. Do not stay inside the saunatoo long as it can cause excessive dehydration.Unload Your Toxins210Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine iii. Detoxification Baths These are baths using natural soaps and oils. They are very effective in removing toxins from our bodies. It is important to use only naturalsoaps and oils to do this. Try this method. Use 1/2 cup of baking soda, 1/2 cup of epsom salt or 1/2 cup of sea salt. Add these into the bath water. Then, soak for15 to 20 minutes. Scrub the skin gently with natural soap. The waterwill turn murky and dirty within minutes as the heavy metals areexcreted from the skin. Immersing in a Jacuzzi bath with addedhydrogen peroxide or ozone is also invigorating and makes a goodstart for the day. It is important to purchase a filter for our shower as more toxins are absorbed during bathing than from drinking tap water. We shouldalso avoid swimming in a chlorinated swimming pool. Go to the beachand swim in the ocean instead. D. Colon Cleanse This method is one of the oldest forms of detoxification as it hasbeen used for 4,000 years. Colon cleansing can heal, rebuild andrestore the colon's size and functions. Colon cleansing works by flushing the colon with a warm water solution. It protects our bodies by removing toxins that may lead tocancer, colitis, digestive disorders, fatigue and obesity. There are two stages in this therapy. The first stage involves a thorough cleaning of the colon. Water is pumped in gently andallowed to flow in and out at steady intervals. The water movesthrough the entire length of the colon and also around the cecum.During this process, the walls of the colon are washed. Any old211encrustations and fecal material are loosened, dislodged and flushed away. These toxic waste materials may have been attached to thewalls for several years. They contain millions of bacteria that canlead to cancer and many other serious diseases. Colon cleansing helps to treat diseases such as severe skin disorders, breathing difficulties, depression, chronic fatigue,nervousness, severe constipation and arthritis. Together with achange in diet and other forms of treatment, the patient will feelmuch better. After colon cleansing, the next stage is healing, rebuilding and restoration of a healthy colon. During the healing phase, a specialliquid is poured into the bowel to cool inflamed areas and strengthenweak sections of the colon wall. Some of the agents used duringthis healing stage are flaxseed tea, white oak bark and slippery elmbark. These herbs soothe and lubricate the colon. In some cases,herbal teas are also taken during colon cleansing. But one thing wemust not forget in this entire process is to drink plenty of water. Probiotics are often added to ensure that beneficial flora remains in positive balance through out the gastrointestinal tract. The mention of enema makes many people feel disgusted and uncomfortable. This notion must be dispelled. In actual fact, it is avery quick and effective way of loosening impacted feces andwashing them away. It also removes the unpleasant symptomsof detoxification. Alternatively, we can consider a colon cleansing diet. Begin with a diet of 50% raw food along with a teaspoonful of linseed or two levelteaspoonfuls of metamucil. The linseed can also be chewed orallyto release the nutrients. Remember to drink plenty of water beforeUnload Your Toxins212Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine breakfast and throughout the day. The water intake should be at least two quarts per day during the cleansing period. E. Lung and Lymphatic Cleanse Cancer cells can't survive in a high-oxygen environment. Using thisfact, we can prevent cancer by doing aerobics exercises and otherforms of exercises to help cleanse the lungs and enrich the body'soxygen intake. When we exercise, the bad air that is trapped inour lungs is forced out in exchange for fresh air. The bad air istrapped in the small alveoli in the lungs and can only be expelledduring exercise. Exercise at least 30 minutes a day if it can be tolerated. This can be broken down into 5- to 10-minute sessions. If you are weak, simplygo for a stroll in the park or jog slowly to keep the optimal oxygencirculation, promote detoxification of the lungs and promote lymphatic drainage. Try to exercise in less polluted areas like the park or gardens that are away from industrial buildings and heavily utilized roads. Ourregime should include breathing exercises to increase the action oflymphatic cleansing. We can do this by synchronizing our breathingwith our body movements during exercise. For example, when weare walking or jumping on the trampoline, we can inhale four timesand exhale four times rhythmically. Breathe in through our nose andexhale through our nose or mouth. A 10-minute deep breathingexercise can be helpful. The lymphatic system drains away toxins and cancer cells. Lymphatic massage or lymphatic drainage machines can enhance it.213F.Kidney and Blood Cleanse Drink your way to good health. Drink a quart of pure filtered water for every 50 pounds of your body weight. But regardless, everyone, young and old, should drink at least 10 to15 glasses offiltered or bottled water daily. Drinking the right type of water is important. Distilled water comes from a process in which water is boiled, evaporated and the vaporcondensed. It has no dissolved minerals and can absorb toxicsubstances from the body and eliminate them. Distilled water is takenduring detoxification for a brief period to help the body eliminateunwanted minerals. Once this is accomplished, the consumption ofdistilled water should be stopped. Too much distilled water over a long time can be dangerous as the rapid loss of sodium, potassium, chloride and trace minerals causemultiple mineral deficiencies. Furthermore, it can also over-acidifythe body. When exposed to air, distilled water absorbs carbon dioxidein the air and becomes acidic with a pH as low as 5.8. (pH of ordinarywater is around 7.) The best drinking water should be slightly alkaline and contain minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Water that has beenfiltered through a carbon block or reverse osmosis tends to beneutral. This is ideal for long-term consumption. We have to ensure that our filters can remove pollutants and parasites such as cryptosporidium . Bottled water may be the next best option if we do not have a filter in our home. However, it has been notedthat about 25 to 30% of bottled water sold in the United States comesfrom tap water that may not be treated.Unload Your Toxins214Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine What Kind of Water Should You Drink? The Best: Pure Filtered Water Second Best: Bottled Water Use Sparingly: Distilled Water Avoid: Tap Water Willard's Water This is a form of mineral water that contains magnesium sulfate, sulfated castor oil, sodium silicate and powdered lignite. A patentedcatalyst usually alters the water. Willard's water is prepared by mixing an ounce of the Willard's water concentrate with a gallon of filtered water. It acts as an antioxidant,an alkalizer and a detoxifier. The pH level of Willard's water is 12.5.Water mixed this way with Willard's water has a pH of 10.4. Some forms of Willard's water contain lignite coal, which is a naturaldetoxifier. Some studies have reported that after drinking this water, toxic metal was found in the test subject's urine. This means that Willard's watermay assist in the detoxification of heavy metals. How much can acancer patient drink in a day? There is no reported limit on the amountof Willard's water one can consume. G. Toxic Metal Cleanse Toxic metals prevent normal enzymatic processes. As a result, the body cannot function properly and repair itself. This leads topremature aging and the early development of disease includingcancer. It is therefore important to detoxify our bodies to get rid ofsuch toxic metals.215We can do this through chelation therapy. In this therapy, toxic metals are removed to allow the body to function at an optimum level. Duringthe chelation process, a synthetic amino acid called EDTA is givento the patient by intravenous bolus or drip. Different clinicians usesdifferent techniques. One session generally runs from 2 to 3 hourswhen 1.5 to 3 grams of sodium EDTA is used. Some clinicians usecalcium-EDTA instead and is able to deliver the necessary 1.5- 3grams chelating agent in a matter of minutes with an IV push. Oncethe EDTA enters the blood stream, it binds to heavy metals such ascadmium, lead, arsenic, and to a lesser degree, mercury. Toxicmetals are damaging to the endothelial wall of the blood vessel.Damaged endothelial wall is unable to secrete a vasodilator callednitrous oxide. Without nitrous oxide, the vessel constricts, leadingto high blood pressure, increased shearing force of blood flow, anda cascade of events known as inflammatory response as the bodytries to overcome this abnormal condition. In this inflammatoryresponse, the body mobilizes white blood cells and macrophages(also called foam cells). Foam cells deposit in the endotheliumand attract oxidized LDL cholesterol. Such oxidized LDL cholesterolin turn attracts other cholesterol of the same, eventually leadingto the formation of soft artherosclerotic plaques and cardio-vascular accidents. As toxic metals are removed, the endothelium insult is reduced, and blood vessel is able to secrete the vasodilator nitrous oxide. Thevessel is relaxed, the lumen size enlarges, and blood flow isincreased. As a result blood pressure is normalized and the risk ofcardiovascular accident reduces. 2. Rebuilding A rebuilding detoxification diet enhances the body's immune system. This process takes place after cleansing. The body can only be rebuiltUnload Your Toxins216Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine with the proper raw materials. One way is to adopt a healthy diet and adhere strictly to it. A rebuilding detoxification diet is essentially vegetarian consisting of whole fruits, green leafy vegetables, legumes and seeds. A limitedamount of fish intake may be permitted. Organic eggs can be eatenbut in reasonable quantities. During the detoxification program, foodgroups are rotated every four days. This allows maximum eliminationfrom the body before another quantity of the same food group isingested. 3. Maintenance After detoxification, we should keep our bodies clean and toxin free.A healthy lifestyle must include exercise, diet, supplementation, stressreduction, hormonal enhancement and a regular intake of cleansingherbal teas. Cleansing Herbal Teas Found in the form of teas, powders or extracts, non-caffeinated herbaltea such as senna leaf, peppermint leaf, steria leaf, buckthorn bark,damiana leaf, red peel, chamomile flower and uva ursi leaf. Cleansingtea is gentle and mild and can be consumed regularly to keep thebody cleansed. Herbal teas do not contain caffeine. Herbal cleansingtea in powder form also comes in a capsule for easier swallowing.They are best taken with meals and digestive enzymes. However,do note that herbal extracts with alcohol content should be avoided. Here is a good example of a simple herbal cleansing program that can be used in conjunction with a detoxification diet. 1. Have a good night's sleep and rise early. 2. Drink a glass of lemon water or plain water with a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses.2173. In the later part of the morning, drink a glass of plain water with added psyllium husk powder, followed by another glass of water. 4. Take two to three multi-digestive enzymes and liver herbs during the three main meals. 5.Drink plenty of herbal cleansing teas in between meals to support the liver. THE GERSON THERAPY OF DETOXIFICATION This therapy was mentioned in the introductory section of this book.The treatment is designed for cancer patients. This therapy was founded by the distinguished Dr Max Gerson. Born and bred in Germany in 1881, Dr Gerson began his quest for a drugto cure migraine. You see, he was suffering from very bad migraine.After searching and experimenting for a period of time, he inventedthe Gerson Therapy of Detoxification. Later, he discovered that thistreatment not only cured his severe migraines, it also cured his skintuberculosis. He felt very excited about this fluke discovery anddecided to use this special detoxification diet to treat manytuberculosis patients. He managed to cure many patients andbecame very successful. A few years later, Dr Gerson used the same therapy on Dr Albert Schweitzer's wife who was afflicted with incurable lung tuberculosis.Her condition was diagnosed as very serious and there was nothingmuch doctors could do to save her. After Dr Gerson placed her onhis program, she began to show signs of recovery. There was hope.She miraculously recovered and continued to live on till old age.Later, Dr Gerson and Dr Schweitzer continued to do more researchon this therapy and discovered that this dietary therapy was also successful in treating heart disease, kidney failure and cancer.Unload Your Toxins218Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine The Gerson Therapy is a program of natural detoxification involving: 1. Detoxification of the whole body. 2. Fortifying the body with potassium. Cancer patients have too much sodium compared to potassium in their bodies. Sodiumacts as a poison in the body because it is an enzyme inhibitor.Potassium is an enzyme activator. 3. Taking oxidizing enzymes in the form of green leaf juice and calf liver juice until the body can produce them on their own. The Gerson Therapy restores the normal condition of the oxidizing system in the body so that cancer cells cannot function. The objectivein this therapy is to boost the body's immune system and cure cancer, arthritis, heart disease, allergies, and many other old-age diseases. The patients take plenty of nutrients from the juice of 13 organically grown vegetables daily. They are taken at intensive intervals of everytwo hours around the clock during the therapy. This intake providesthe body with a mega dose of enzymes, minerals and nutrients and helps to break down the bad cells in the body. At the same time, coffee enemas also used in this therapy will aid in removing thelifelong buildup of toxins from the liver. The Gerson Therapy hascelebrated high success over the past 60 years. Many people weremiraculously cured after going through this program. It also boastsof its success in treating melanoma, lymphoma, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, lupus and arthritis.219/fl1rtCHAPTER TEN ANTI-CANCER DIET There is an abundance of scientific evidence showing that a clinically guided nutrition program for the cancer patient...can improve quality of life by 12 to 21 fold... and a greater likelihood of complete remission.\" Patrick Quillin, PhD, in Beating Cancer with Nutrition. 220Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine We live in a world of over-calorie and under-nutrition. Sadly the statistics show that 74% of Americans are below daily RDA requirements for magnesium, 55% for iron, 50% vitamin A. According to Patrick Quillin, PhD, author of Beating Cancer with Nutrition , 25 to 50% of hospital patients suffer from protein calorie malnutrition. Pure malnutrition (cachexia) is responsible for atleast 22% and up to 67% of all cancer deaths. Up to 80% of allcancer patients have reduced levels of serum albumin, whichis a leading indicator of protein and calorie malnutrition. Atleast 20% of Americans are clinically malnourished, with 70%being sub-clinically malnourished, and the remaining 'chosenfew' 10% in good optimal health. For decades, physicians learned and people are told that daily diet provides all the necessary nutrients one will need for a healthy life.This is no longer true today. We now know that food alone simply cannot supply all the nutrients that our body needs for optimumhealth, let alone the dosage and level used as a modality for the reversal of disease such as cancer. Moreover, today's food is devoidof many minerals and vitamins compared to those a few decadesago. This is probably because of the changing environment andpollution. Today, nutritional science is used by many forward-looking physicians. Nutritional cancer therapy is now a mainstream medical movementin the United States and Canada. It is supported by doctors from theHarvard School of Medicine, National Cancer Institute and NationalInstitutes of Health. Some high-profiled doctors such as Dr CharlesSimone, the oncologist to President Reagan, and Dr Abram Hoffer,a chief collaborator with Linus Pauling, have also endorsed this221Anti-Cancer Diet treatment. If only doctors had embraced this concept much earlier, more lives could have been saved. While conventional therapies weaken the body over time, alternative non-toxic nutritional therapies build up the body's anti-cancerdefense. Many miraculous recoveries from cancer have beenreported from this form of treatment. A study reported that 88% of spontaneous remission involves significant dietary change andthe intake of nutritional supplementation and herbs. Is there any surprise that poor nutrition is a major causative factor in cancer? Nutrition is the foundation of health and a cornerstone incancer therapy. In fact, malnutrition alone kills 40% of cancer patientsas we have mentioned earlier. Nutrition therefore plays the criticalpart of a complete non-toxic natural therapeutic program for treatingcancer. BENEFITS OF A GOOD DIET You take in an average of over 20 tons of food in a lifetime. You are literally what you eat. There is no doubt that a good diet increases the cancer patient's lifespan. An optimum level of nutrients fights cancer in manydifferent ways. 1. Free radical regulators. A high-sugar diet leads to vitamin C depletion as the body uses endogenous vitamin C as anantioxidant to overcome the free radical damage of sugar.Excessive free radical damage therefore results in vitaminC deficiency. 2. Nutrients are able to change cell membrane dynamics where most hormone receptors are located. The fat in the diet dictatesthe composition of this lipid bilayer. Omega-3 fatty acid from fish222Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine oil and GLA from borage oil enhance cell membranes to increase receptor sensitivity to insulin and prevent insulin resistance.Insulin resistance afflicts over 60 million Americans and has beenlinked to a variety of cancers. CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ANTI-CANCER DIET 1. Low in Sugar Cancer lives well in a sugar environment. They use sugar as a formof fuel instead of oxygen. As such, a diet rich in sugar will promotecancer cell growth and reduce our immune function. Studies haveshown that animals that are fed a low-sugar diet have a 95% chanceof survival after injection of mammary tumor into their bodies. Animalsthat were a fed high-sugar diet only had a survival rate of 33%.Clearly, sugar is a silent killer. Over the past century, the consumption of refined sugar has increased from 60 to 180 pounds a year per person. Today'sgeneration seems to be taking in more sugar in various forms.Scientist Dr Warburg said that cancers exhibit an increase inanaerobic glycolysis. This is a process whereby glucose is used as a fuel by cancer cells with lactic acid as by-product. Cancer cells contain three times as much insulin as normal cells. A sugarlessdiet is therefore a key component of any cancer diet. With no sugar,the cancer cells cannot thrive. It is important to starve the cancercell by taking less sugar and more whole foods, fresh vegetablesand vegetable juice. We should also refrain from animal productsor by-products as these products are high in saturated fats andpromote cancer. Sugar can also be found in potato, white bread,pastas and corn. We will now look at a few examples. A study using a mouse model of human breast cancer shows that tumors are sensitive to glucose.In the study, 68 mice were injected with an aggressive strain of breast223cancer and then fed diets to induce high, normal or low blood sugar. The results showed that the lower the sugar level, the higher thesurvival rate. Another study of four years was conducted at the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection in the Netherlands. Agroup comprising 111 biliary tract cancer patients was comparedwith a control group of 480 people. The study showed similar resultsthat proved that a higher cancer risk was related to a high intakeof sugar. In another epidemiological study in 21 developed countries, it was reported that sugar intake is a strong risk factor that contributes tohigher breast cancer rates. All cancer patients must reduce their sugar intake. It will surely slow down the effects and invasiveness of cancer. We are not implyingthat sugar should be avoided totally. A certain amount of sugar isneeded for basic function. Instead, we should ensure that our bloodglucose is within a narrow range to help starve the cancer cells andboost immune functions. Glycemic Index Glycemic index is a measure of how fast a food increases the blood sugar. Controlling blood sugar is one of the key pillars in a successfulanti-cancer diet. High blood sugar and high triglyceride are bothdirect reflections of high sugar. Knowing what low sugar food totake is important. Concentrate on food with an index of under 70 and preferably under 60. Good choices include basmati rice, oats, millet and bailey. Here is a table of common foods and their glycemic index . To reduce blood sugar handling stress, concentrate on foods with an index at or below 75. This will help create a more even flow of glucose intoAnti-Cancer Diet224Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine the blood. If you are taking high-glycemic index food like white bread, always try to mix it up low-glycemic index food to average out their indexes. GLYCEMIC INDEX Grain and Cereal Products Vegetables White Rice, Short Grain 83 Baked Potato 85 White Bread 70 White Potato 82 Whole Wheat Bread 70 Sweet Potato 61Brown Rice, Long Grain 50 New Potato 58 Rye Bread 50 Corn 54 White Spaghetti 40 Carrot 47Wheat Spaghetti 37 Yam 37 Breakfast Cereals Legumes Cornflakes 92 Baked Beans 60 Puffed Rice 82 Soybeans 48 Shredded Wheat 80 Peas (dried) 32Grape Nut 78 Butter Beans 31 Oatmeal (regular) 49 Lentils 29 All Bran 38 Kidney Beans 28 Chickpeas 28225Fruits Dairy Products Watermelon 72 Ice cream 62 Raisin 64 Yogurt 36Banana 52 Whole Milk 34 Mango 51 Skim Milk 32 Orange Juice 46Grape 45 Orange 40 Sweeteners Apple 39 Maltose 152Plum 39 Glucose 100 Pear 38 Honey 87 Peach 38 Sucrose 86Grapefruit 26 Fructose 20 Adapted from D.J.A. Jenkins et. al., American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Volume 34, 1981 2. High in Antioxidants Most green leafy vegetables are high in antioxidants. The more colorful the vegetable, the higher the level. Broccoli, spinach, bokchoy are particularly good choices. Be careful to refrain fromeating vegetables that grow underground, such as potato or carrotsas these are high in starch and sugar. These are vegetables butbehave like a grain and turn quickly into sugar when inside our body. Dietary antioxidant in high doses have been shown to enhance chemotherapy and radiotherapy agents if given in series on adaily basis during the course of chemo- and radiotherapy. Somenutrients, too, augment the effect of chemotherapeutic agents . Studies have shown that high doses of vitamin C, beta-carotene,Anti-Cancer Diet226Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine and vitamin E succinate, can cause a 50% reduction in melanoma cell growth, while there is no effect on normal cells. In selected casessuch as colon cancer, vitamin E has been shown to be more effective than 5FU in reducing cancer cell based on laboratory animal models.Antioxidants also increase the effect of hyperthermia without affectingthe normal cell. 3. Promoters of an Alkaline Environment We have said that cancer cells thrive in an acidic environment. The three primary generators of acid in a cancer patient are: 1.The metabolism and/or incomplete breakdown (oxidation) of foodstuffs or metabolic \"wastes\" as a by-product of cellular activity. During normal cellular respiration and energyproduction, acids are produced as part of these \"waste\"products. These acids must be \"balanced\", neutralized, orremoved by the body's buffering and detoxification systemsthrough the kidneys, lungs, liver and blood. In the case of acancer patient, this is even more prevalent as cancer cells take in sugar as fuel and release lactic acid as waste. 2.The consumption of acid present in food, air, and drinking water. Nitrogen emissions from automobiles and industrial plants, food dyes, sprays, waxes, preservatives, additives,artificial sweeteners, fertilizers, water pollutants, and even the chlorides and fluorides in tap water are just some of the highly acidic chemicals ingested by millions everyday. Foods are generally broken down and converted into either acidic or alkaline substrates with digestion. A person with an acidic metabolic condition should step up his consumption of alkali-forming foods daily, with 60-70% alkali-forming foods, and 30-40% acid-forming food by volume.227Anti-Cancer Diet Do not mistakenly eat all alkali-forming food alone, as some acid formation is necessary to generate metabolic activity andmaintain homeostasis. Too alkaline a body can predispose the body to certain types of infection. Here are some of the common acid and alkali forming foods. These categories are based on the body's reaction to a moderateamount of each. Excess amounts may produce the opposite effect. Acid-Producing Foods most grains pasta eggs most chemicals and drugs most beans fish dairy sugar, saccharin,meat fowl red meat tobacco, soft drinks tempeh nuts vinegar most alcoholic beverages coffee, tea, beer Alkali-Producing Foods miso sea salt yeast fruits (except cranberry, blueberry,millet soy sauce seaweed prune, plum) seeds green soy bean soda water sprouts lima bean tofu green pea Alkali-Producing Vegetables -green leafy vegetables (watercress, spinach, kale, etc.) -below the ground type \"root\" vegetables (carrot, turnip, onion etc.) -other above ground vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, squash, cucumber etc.)228Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine 4. Promoters of the Immune System Good nutrition leads to a strong immune system. The foods that promote such a system include garlic, onions, grapes, tomatoes,and broccoli. There is little doubt that a high sugar environmentretards the immune system. WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE? The evidence is in the following case studies. 1. In 1995, a study with a sampling group of 48,000 men reported that those who ate 10 servings of tomato-rich foods every weekreduced their risk of prostate cancer by 50%. 2. It is common for men to have pre-cancerous prostate lesions. In the United States, the rate of advance prostate cancer is sixtimes more then the rate in Japan. The average American's dietcontains 40% of fat whilst the Japanese's diet only has 20% ofit. This clearly shows that fat consumption increases the risk ofprostate cancer. 3. Animal studies have shown that tumor cells are less aggressive in animals on a low-fat diet than in those fed a higher-fat diet. 4. A study was conducted with a large sampling group of 83,000 women. Their ages were between 33 to 60 years. It was reportedthat consumption of fruits and vegetables high in specificcarotenoids and vitamins had a significant reduction inpremenopausal breast cancer risk. This was especially so whenthere was a family history of breast cancer.229WHAT FOOD TO EAT? Include plenty of green leafy vegetables, water, legume, whole grain, seeds and essential fats in your everyday healthy diet. These foodsare often quite under-rated. How then should we go about choosing a well-balanced diet? Here's a guide. A normal meal should contain 25% lean or plant protein,35% cooked plant food such as beans, whole grain bread or wholegrain tortilla and 40% raw vegetables such as broccoli, spinach,tomato and raw fruits. When choosing what food to consume, we should take note of the following factors. Raw food and moderately cooked food is more beneficial. Select the ones that are of low-glycemic index. For example, we shouldtake pureed carrots instead of carrot juice. Take fresh low-glycemic organic fruits Some examples are apples, apricots, currants, nectarines, peaches, plumsand pineapples. Sprouted and cooked cereal grains are good. These include oats, basmati rice, millet, rye, barley and buckwheat. Eat vegetable protein instead of animal protein. Vegetable proteins include legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans, limabeans and green peas, nuts and seeds. Refrain from cooking with unsaturated oils and margarine totally. Instead, take butter and olive oil. Coffee intake should be restricted. Switch to decaffeinated coffee and a maximum of one cup a day. The best is to refrain fromcoffee totally. Heavy meals are to be avoided at night. Do not combine fruits with concentrated proteins in the same meal that may produce gas and discomfort.Anti-Cancer Diet230Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Drink two pints of freshly made vegetable juice per day. This should include combinations of endive, lettuce, cabbage, celery,parsley and spinach. Carrot or beetroot are high in sugar content.Small amounts are acceptable. Include some of the pulps in thejuice. Citrus fruits are not recommended for every patient. Sometimes, fresh oranges or grapefruit can be taken in betweenmeals. Citrus fruit juice and vegetable juice should not beconsumed within one hour of a meal. The exception is lemonand lime. Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup of lemon juice to each meal. Thejuice should be poured over the meal or consumed directly in acup of water to aid digestion. Lemon juice is a rich source of citricacid and potassium. When combined with potassium citrate, it isone of the strongest blood alkalizers. All fruits, vegetables, fish and meat should be washed in a diluted 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide or given a 20-minute wash inan ozonated water bath help to remove bacteria on the food. Flaxseed or cold-pressed and unrefined flaxseed oil is an excellent source of dietary fat. More than 60% of flaxseed oil isalpha-linolenic acid. This acid is a form of omega-3 fatty acid thatour bodies require for immunity boosting. Flaxseed should notbe heated as heating will cause free radicals to be formed. Itshould be mixed directly with sulfur-rich foods such as legumes.The recommended dose is 1 to 2 tablespoon daily. Animal protein especially commercially grown poultry should be avoided if you have cancer. Not more than 60 grams of protein per day(1 gm per kg body weight) is needed normally. Only onetype of protein should be consumed per meal so as to avoid stresson the digestive organ. Don't take animal protein such as beefduring the evening meal because our digestive system is lessactive at night and excessive proteins not broken down can resultin toxicity and the promotion of cancer. Organic meat should bechosen over commercially raised meat. The best beef comes fromgrass-fed cattle, and the best chicken are free-range organically231fed poultry. Avoid most dairy products except organic yogurt, organic buttermilk and organic low-fat cottage cheese. Take more vegetable proteins such as lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans, lima beans and green peas. Raw almonds are excellent sources of protein for cancer patients. It can also be ground to make almond butter. Peanuts must beavoided for their possible aflatoxin contamination. Seeds suchas sesame, pumpkin and sunflower should be eaten raw. Dietary Principles for Easy Digestion 1. Easy to digest food include: Spouted beans Grains with vegetables Vegetables with medium starch content such as carrot, parsnip, squash, pumpkin and corn. Medium-starch food mixed with high-starch foods such as cereals, potato, rice, sweet potato and yam. 2. Moderately easy to digest food includesProteins with leafy green vegetables. 3. Difficult to digest food includes Proteins with starch food. Oil with protein. Fruits with vegetables. Proteins with sweet fruits such as papayas, bananas and figs. Acidic fruits such as grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, all berries, tomatoes, and cucumber). Sub-acid fruits such as apples, apricots, mangoes, nectarines, peaches, grapes and raisins.Anti-Cancer Diet232Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Do I Have to be a Vegetarian? You have to decide this for yourself. Basically, it is not necessary to be a total vegetarian, although we all know that the vegetarian diet is very healthy and ideal for fighting cancer. If we are regularmeat eaters, it will be very difficult for us to change overnight. Wemay perhaps take small amounts of meat for a start and thengradually reduce this amount. For example, those of Nordic-Germanic ancestry have the constitution to use meat and dairyproducts well, but have difficulty with large quantities of plant-basedprotein such as soy. Many people will find a sudden switch of diet very stressful. As such, a drastic change in diet is not favorable. It will probably lead to more stress. We should take our time to change our diet. Sometimes,this period can be as long as one to two years, but the change shoulddefinitely not be attempted within one to two weeks. Whey Protein to Supplement Nutrition Cancer uses energy in the most inefficient way. The majority of thecancer patients die of cachexia. This happens because the bodyhas not enough nutrition to maintain the greedy appetite of the cancercells. The cancer process exhausts all the energy reserves in thesecancer patients. The loss of reserves is often not replenished due tothe patient's poor appetite. It is therefore very important for a cancerpatient to have a balanced and easily assimilated high-energy diet.Their diet should consist of whole grains, leafy vegetables, legumesand low-glycemic fruits. Whey protein has long been a source ofprotein for many countries. It is now considered an excellentprotein supplement. To compare protein sources we use an index called the Biological Value. The biological value indicates the quality level of proteins. It is a measure of how easily the body can use the particular protein.233This is often reflected as a percentage. Biological values tell us which proteins are best at aiding nitrogen retention in muscles. Thebiological value of whey protein is higher than that of milk, fish, beef,soy, wheat, beans and peanuts. Whey proteins retain the highest amount of immune-enhancing proteins. These include: Lactoferrin, an iron-binding, iron-modulating anti- viral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Immunoglobulins that support the immune system. Lactoferrin and immunoglobulins provide generous amounts of cysteine and glutamine. These are precursors to glutathione, thebody's main antioxidant. It provides intracellular defense againstoxidative stresses caused by free radicals, reactive oxygenintermediates and toxic chemicals. Studies have indicated that whey proteins have anti-cancer properties. During a study conducted, six prostate cancer patientswho were given whey proteins experienced anti-cancer effects. Itwas also concluded that whey protein at 20 to 30 grams daily reducedthe PSA ( a marker for prostatic cancer) concentrations. However,no firm conclusion was drawn and more thorough studies will haveto be carried out. But note that although whey protein is a good source for supplementation, it cannot be used as a meal replacement.Anti-Cancer Diet234Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine HOW FOOD-BASED ANTIOXIDANTS FIGHT CANCER We will now look at how food with antioxidant properties fights cancer. Phase 1 (Initiation Phase)In this phase, enzymes are produced to break down pro-carcinogens to carcinogens. Garlic and onions limit the production of phase-1enzymes. Phase 2 (Promotion Phase)Enzymes are produced to remove residuals left behind by the phase- 1 enzymes. Broccoli helps to boosts production of phase-2 enzymes. Cell promotion leads to uncontrolled cell growth. Flaxseed and fish oil stop cell growth. The hormone estrogen promotes cell growth.The consumption of soy products will compete with estrogen cellreceptors and reduce cancer formation. Phase 3 (Angiogenesis)Cancer cell spreads by creating new blood vessels. Red grapes help to prevent the development of new blood vessels via theirenzyme called co-oxygenase 2 (or cox 2) inhibitors. SPECIFIC ANTI-CANCER FOODS As explained in the previous paragraph, the growth cycle of cancercells involves various phases. We will now take a closer look atsome of those anti-cancerous foods mentioned there.235Anti-Cancer Diet Carotenoids This is a group of more than 500 different pigments found in plants. They include beta-carotene found in carrots, leutin and lycopenefound in tomatoes and zeaxanthin. They perform a slightly differentfunction from other antioxidants. Certain forms of carotenoids candestroy singlet oxygen, which is bad oxygen. Studies have shownthat diets rich in carotenoids can reduce cancer. Cruciferous vegetables Good examples are broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and bokchoy. They produce phytoestrogen, which acts as an estrogencompetitor and reduces the amount of estrogen responsible forpromoting breast, cervical, ovarian and uterine cancer. Laetrile (amyglalin) Laetrile is a chemical found in the kernels of apricot pits, apple seeds,bitter almonds and some stone fruits and nuts. Some laetrilepromoters call it vitamin B17.Some researchers believe that laetrile can improve the patient'ssense of well-being, relieve the pain of cancer and reduce paincaused by medication. Laetrile is broken down into glucose, benzaldehyde and cyanide. These three components help to give the patients extra energy andreduce their pain. Cyanide destroys cancer cells. When laetrile isused together with vitamin A and enzymes, its anti-cancer effectsare even more pronounced. The recommended dosage is 9 gram intravenously daily for up to three weeks, followed by 500 mg three times daily by mouth. Thepatient should continue to take this supplement even during remissionaccording some physicians. Eating two to four apricot kernels two236Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine to three times a day will also provide the recommended amount. Unsulfured dried fruits are also excellent. Blackberries, raspberries, cranberries, gooseberries and elderberries can also be substituted. Laetrile is ineffective against brain cancers, sarcomas of the muscle, connective tissues, fat tissues and bone tissues. It is useful forcancers of the lungs, breasts, colon, ovaries, stomach, esophagusand the prostate and lymphomas. Many doctors are skeptical about laetrile, and the laetrile controversy goes back some 50 years and is still raging. It is not available in theUSA. Some physicans believe that laetrile causes cyanide poisoning.However, this apparently only occurs when laetrile is taken orallywhen it is broken down to cyanide. The safe procedure is to inject laetrile intravenously as this method does not release any cyanide. Garlic Garlic has been used since biblical times as an immune boosterand antibacterial agent. It can stimulate the immune system and is a natural antibiotic and antioxidant. Garlic eaters have lower risk of throat, stomach and colon cancer. Raw garlic taken orally is the most effective but it can be quite difficult to swallow because of its pungent smell. Cooked garlic is not as effective as cooking destroys its antioxidant properties. An alternative is the tablet or capsule form, which can be taken once or twicea day. Some Special Considerations Gingko biloba extract should be taken for one month after radiation therapy. It helps to cleanse the blood and enhancescirculation. The recommended dosage is 100mg a day. Sea vegetables are excellent for thyroid support for at least one month after radiation.237/fl1rt\"It amazes me how much of what passes for knowledge in cancer therapy turns out to be incomplete, inadequate, and anecdotal.\" Ralph Moss, PhD Noted Cancer Researcher in The Cancer Industry.CHAPTER ELEVEN OTHER NATURAL THERAPIES 238Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine In the last few chapters, we have looked at ways of treating cancer by consuming non-toxic food-based natural compounds. We are now very clear that these natural compounds can be used to boost our immunity, stop cancer growth, optimize intracellular functions, maintain a healthy biological terrain and detoxify ourbodies. In this final chapter, we will examine other forms of natural therapies not related to natural compounds but related to the characteristics of the cancerous process. Many of these therapies have been extensively clinically used for decades. Scientific documentation and double blind studies required by modern medicine are incomplete, but anecdotal reports frompatients point to their validity. Suffice to say that provided there is no harm, many patients, out of desperation, will attempt to implement any one or all of these modalities. Many advance cancer clinics inMexico or Western Europe employ these modalities. They are by no means \"quackery\" as others may wish you to believe. It is fair to say, however, that there is simply not enough data to pass the high levelof scientific scrutiny. Hyperthermia to Kill Cancer Cells Hyperthermia uses concentrated therapeutic heat to treat cancer.The therapy works on the basis that cancer cells are far moresensitive to heat than healthy cells. When the cancer cells are heated, their enzymes, membranes and DNA are damaged and their blood supply will be cut off, resulting in the eventual death of the cancercells. There are five different methods of achieving hyperthermia.1. Firstly, the body temperature of the patient is raised to 103 \u00b0F using sauna-like chambers.239Other Natural Therapies 2.Secondly, heat is only directed at the tumor or metastasized sites. In this case, the temperature is raised to a high of between 107 \u00b0F and 109.4 \u00b0F. 3. In the third method, direct strong infrared radiation is applied to the cancerous areas. Probes or focused emitting devices areused in these methods. 4. The next method is to raise the whole-body temperature in a more moderate way, from 98.6 \u00b0F to 104 \u00b0F using whole-body wet wraps, saunas and hot baths. 5. The final method involves removing blood from the body and cycling it through a heat machine. As such, the temperature ofthe blood is raised and then reinfused into the body. During the hyperthermia treatment, ginseng and quercetin should be taken to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment. Quercetin helps to stop histamine release and synthesis of proteins that help tumors resist heat stresses. It also prevents the transport of lacticacid out from the cancer cell. The acidity of the cancer cell is reduced, preventing cancer growth. Whether or not this treatment is successful depends on the site and stage of the cancer, the age of patient, immune resistance and the tumor response rate. This treatment is very popular in Europe. Bioresonance to Induce Cell Decomposition (Lysis) This method uses computerized equipment to irradiate patients with energy in the form of sound frequencies. Some people refer to this as Rife Technology as it was first advanced by Dr Rife. The energyemitted into our bodies must match the vibratory frequencies of elements within our bodies. This mechanism radiates energy with their aggregate thus allowing the atoms in the cell to create asignature oscillation pattern. As cancer cells and normal cells have different vibratory frequencies, radio waves are set to resonate with these frequencies. The targeted cancer cells are then destroyed.240Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Some doctors have used this therapy for many decades. However, its applications and effectiveness are still very controversial due to the lack of scientific research and clinical studies. Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation (UBI) Therapy This therapy is also called photoluminotescence. It involves exposing small quantities of the cancer patient's blood to ultraviolet light so as to stimulate and boost the immune system and destroy cancer cells. During this procedure, a small amount of blood is removed from the body. After irradiating this blood with ultraviolet light, it is returned intravenously to the patient. This procedure may be done daily andit generally takes one to two hours. This therapy can inactivate toxins, destroy and inhibit bacteria and viruses, increase the oxygen levels in the blood and decrease platelet aggregation. Oxygenating Therapies Cancer cells and oxygen do not go together. Cancer cells cannotlive well in an oxygen-rich environment. Oxygen therapy also boosts the immune system and various enzyme systems by increasing the production of cytokines. These areimmunologically active proteins that directly and indirectly destroy microorganisms or tumor cells. Oxygen can be introduced into the body by a variety of mechanisms. Hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Oxygen is forced into the body via a pressurized chamber. This process enriches the oxygencontent in the body or cell. Aerobic exercise gives oxygen to the entire body system. Ozone insuflation via the ear, rectum or by ozoning the patient's blood can increase oxygen in the body. Ozone, a less stable formof oxygen, contains three oxygen atoms per molecule. It is more241reactive than oxygen and readily oxidizes other chemicals. When the extra oxygen atom breaks away, the O2 molecule is left behind. The net effect is an increase in the body's oxygen level. Ozonetherapy can be combined with a proper diet, nutritionalsupplementations, herbs, botanicals and other natural non-toxiccancer therapies for maximum effectiveness. Autohemotherapy. This is a simple procedure whereby 100 to 250 ml of the patient's blood is removed and then mixed withozone and oxygen. Thereafter, it is reinfused into the patient'sbloodstream. The entire process takes about 45 minutes. It isthe most common form of ozone therapy today and very safe. Germanium Sesquioxide. This natural element helps the body activate and use oxygen. It is administered intravenously or orally.The dose is 500 mg a day during initial therapy. It can be takenorally at 100 to 150 mg a day. Hydrogen Peroxide Infusion Therapy. This therapy has been very successful and can be used on its own or together with chemotherapeutic agents. It can increase the body's immune response and make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects ofradiation therapy. Using hydrogen peroxide diluted in water canincrease the oxygen level in the tumor area and help to destroyit. In the Hospital Santa Monica, more than 30,000 infusions wereadministered. There was no reported negative reaction. Theinfusion for the cancer patient is slow over a period of 1 to 1.5hours. After that, they reported improved mental clarity and asense of relaxation. We need to flush our bodies with lots ofantioxidants when this method is used. As such, the hydrogenperoxide infusion is often alternated with intravenous vitamin Cdrips. Magnetic Therapy The basis of magnetic therapy is simple. In our bodies are magnetic fields that are generated by the chemical reactions within the cellsand the ionic currents of the nervous system. The catalytic reactionsOther Natural Therapies242Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine of enzymes are all driven by magnetic fields and produce magnetic field themselves. Each cell is a small magnet and the whole body is a gigantic magnet with a low magnetic field force. Today, scientists have found that external magnetic fields can affect the body's function. This therapy restores the body's healthy magneticfields and promotes recovery from cancer. It works on the notion that when the north magnetic pole is applied to a cancer growth or an area of inflammation, the cancer growth will be inhibited. On theother hand, the south pole tends to stimulate cancer growth. Studies showed that when tissue culture was exposed to both positive and negative magnetic fields, the cancer receded in an environment of negative field. On the other hand, when a positive magnetic field was applied, the cancer grew. As such, some scientists are lookingto test the notion that negative polarity magnetic fields have beneficial effect on living organisms whereas positive polarity magnetic fields have a bad effect. There are no known side effects in this therapy. It has been implied that a negative electric field maintains the alkaline state, thus preventing cancer growth, however more research is needed. Lymphatic Therapy Lymphatic therapy enhances the immune system's ability for phagocytosis of the metastatic cancer cell. It also increases the negative charges present on the wall of the fluid system, thus destroying cancer cells. This therapy involves opening drainage sitesin the upper chest and neck. When the drainage system is opened, lymph is then drained into the bloodstream where it is then channeled to the liver where detoxification occurs. Commonly, lymphatic therapy employs a special light beam generator that looks like a flashlight. When placed on the body, it opens up the243lymphatic drainage system. This process is painless and non- invasive. The lymphatic sessions usually last for 30 to 45 minutes. Insulin Potentiation Therapy Since 1928, insulin has been used to treat diabetes in many parts of the world. In 1950, it was also used to treat patients with mental illness. As some of these mental patients also had cancer at the same time, doctors unexpectedly discovered that this insulin therapycured both their mental condition as well as their cancer. The reason is logical. Cancer cells thrive on sugar and they have more insulin receptors compared to normal cells. Depriving the cancer cell of sugar is a death warrant for them. During insulin therapy, the blood sugar level is significantly reduced to 50 mg/dl. At this level, the patient may feel drowsy and weak for a short period when the cancer cells are crying out for sugar. Thecancer cell, striving for sugar, takes up sugar rapidly after being starved. Any chemotherapeutic agents, when infused with sugar infusion, will be selectively taken up by the starved cancer cells.This is an effective way to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to target cancer cells without negative effects to normal cells. Zoetron Therapy This therapy uses a special device called a Zoetron that generates a pulsed magnetic field to create hyperthermia directed only at cancerous cells. Normal cells are not damaged and there are no adverse side effects in this treatment. Specifically the Zoetron device delivers a magnetic field in the form of vibrations to heat up particles in the cancer cells. As cancer cellscontain a higher concentration of iron than normal cells, they are more attracted to the magnetic pulse. Vibration energy is transformedOther Natural Therapies244Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine into heat and cancer cells are killed when the heat becomes intense. The temperature threshold for cancer cell death is 42 \u00b0C to 43 \u00b0C. This therapy is practiced in Mexico. A normal course of treatment consists of 30 sessions lasting two hours each. Studies have shownthat this treatment is very effective in prolonging the lives of pancreatic cancer patients.245Epilog EPILOG By now, we know that cancer is not simply the localized lumps and bumps that we have been programmed to accept through the years. Cancer in the adult can often be viewed as a degenerative processwith symptoms representative of underlying systemic dysfunction. We all have cancer cells in our bodies. It is only when our body is unable to get rid of the cancer cells that a disease process takesplace. This is when we are diagnosed as having cancer. What are the underlying system's dysfunctions? There are many factors, including emotional, diet, drugs and chemicals, infections, genetic mutation and environmental pollutants. Conventional treatments look at cancer as a disease state. The natural-oriented doctor views cancer as a set of symptoms reflecting underlying disease. The conventional treatment of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy has been the cornerstone of cancer treatment over the past 50 years.Today, the clinical success of these treatments has reached a plateau. There is an urgent need to rise above this cure plateau by trying fresh approaches. In the United States, much controversy has arisen between mainstream and alternative medicine. The cancer establishment,championed by the American Cancer Society (ACS) has characterized natural and adjunctive cancer therapies as the works of quacks preying on desperate and credulous cancer victims, whilethe proponents of alternative therapies have depicted established therapies as the \"cut, burn, and poison\" therapies of a cynical and profit-driven conspiracy. Interestingly, this adversarial position has disappeared in many European countries like Switzerland, Germany, England and theNetherlands, where an open co-existence of natural and conventional medicine in a complementary setting prospers. Many treatments246Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine not available in the United States are widely available and practiced legally in these countries. Looking at vitality statistics, these countriesalso rank ahead of the United States in longevity. Natural-oriented doctors view natural therapies as a way to complement conventional therapies and help the patient overcome cancer without toxic side effects. After reading this book, you should realize that both conventional and alternative therapies are effectiveforms of cancer treatment. Today, many natural and non-toxic modalities are offered in many countries such as Switzerland, Germany, England, Mexico and the Netherlands. The results areexcellent. However, in the United States, it is still not well recognized. Many doctors do not recommend them. The most common reasons are ignorance and rigid medical standards. This may be theunderlying reason as to why United States ranks a low 13 th on the longevity scale despite having the most advance medical technology in the world. In the words of John Diamond, MD, & Lee Cowden, MD: Conventional cancer treatments are in place as the law of the land because they pay, not heal, the best. Modern natural medicine approaches cancer therapy by incorporating the use of antioxidants, lifestyle changes, herbs, and dietary modification to beat it. These approaches will also help toprepare the cancer patient's body for conventional treatment. The side effects will be reduced. Neither conventional nor alternative treatment holds the magic bullet in cancer treatment. Combiningthe best of both worlds to beat cancer makes the most logical sense for the patient. Looking into the future, the good news is that less toxic and target- specific chemotherapeutic agents are being developed. More research and clinical studies are also being conducted on naturaltherapies. The general success rates are getting higher when both conventional alternate treatments are used. However, we must also247note that just as there are conventional therapies that do not work, the same should be expected of certain natural or alternative therapies. The success of a treatment often depends on the stage of cancer, the age, the immunity status, and the tumor responserate of the patient. As more research is carried out new cures will be found. Unfortunately, most cancer patients do not have time to wait. Sometimes, they are only given a few more months to live. They and their families are desperate and will look for any modalitythat offers a promise. This book has attempted to put into a logical framework the hundreds of alternative options available so we can further discuss them with our doctor. Practitioners of natural therapies range from lay people with no medical training to highly trained doctors who have departed fromtheir mainstream practice. The vast majority are doctors seeking to supplement careful use of conventional therapies with natural approaches and not to replace them. The complete natural healing program should include a therapeutic blend of vitamins, herbs, minerals and enzymes. Choosing the propercombination and dosage of these natural compounds is an important key to success. This comes with not only experience but also an extensive medical knowledge of the cancer disease. It is thereforehighly recommended to consult a nutritionally oriented physician with an orthomolecular oncology experience before you start any treatment program.Epilog248Beating Cancer with Natural Medicine Abou-Issa H et al: Relative efficacy of glucarate on the initiation and promotion phase of rate mammary Anticancer Res 1995;May-Jun:15(3):805-10.
