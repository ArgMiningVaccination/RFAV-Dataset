We evaluated whether use of HRS was associated with breast cancer risk, using a population-based case-control study in 3 counties of the Philadelphia metropolitan area consist-ing of 949 breast cancer cases and 1,524 controls. Use of HRS var- ied signicantly by race, with African American women being more likely than European American women to use any herbalpreparation (19.2% vs.14.7%, p50.003) as ratio 0.39, 95% CI: 0.22-0.70). Thisassociation was similar among women who reported use of either black cohosh or Remifemin (an herbal preparation derived from black cohosh; adjusted odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI: 0.27-0.82). Theliterature reports that black cohosh may be effective in treating menopausal symptoms, and has antiestrogenic, antiproliferative and antioxidant properties. Additional conrmatory studies are required to determine whether black cohosh could be used to pre- vent breast cancer. '2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: breast cancer; prevention; complementary alternative medicine Hormone-related supplements (HRS) are widely used by women for the management of menopausal symptoms. While the speciccontents of these preparations are unregulated by the Federal gov-ernment, they generally contain phytoestrogens and other com-pounds that are thought to mimic the effect of endogenous estro-gens. Commonly used preparations include herbal of thesepreparations contain a variety of herb-derived compounds, includ-ing those listed earlier. However, due to lack of standardization andgovernment oversight, the concentrations and composition of thesecompounds varies widely. It has been suggested that women who have diets rich in phy- toestrogens, including women from Asian countries, may be atdecreased breast cancer risk. 1,2However, epidemiological evidence that phytoestrogen consumption is associated with modied cancerrisk is largely limited to food intake, and has not revealed associa-tions of specic compounds with breast cancer risk or protection. 2,3 The mechanism of this putative breast cancer protective effect alsoremains unclear. It has been proposed that the relatively weaker es-trogenic effect of phytoestrogens may compete with that of estra-diol and have antiproliferative properties that decrease breast can-cer risk. 1,4-6However, there is also evidence that the estrogenic ac- tivity of some of these compounds, including binding to estrogenreceptors (ERs),7,8may stimulate breast tumor cell proliferation at physiological concentrations,9-12and increase endogenous steroid hormone levels.13In addition, estrogenic effects are not consistent across all phytoestrogen-containing compounds. For example,black cohosh is consistently viewed as anti- proliferative and antioxidant properties ( e.g., Refs. 14 and 15). Thus, the mechanism of action of these compounds in relievingmenopausal symptoms or their potential relationship with hor-mone-induced cancer risk remains unclear. To address these issues,we used a population-based case-control study of women in thePhiladelphia region to evaluate whether commonly used HRS formanagement of menopausal symptoms were associated with breastcancer risk or protection. Material and methods Study design and data collection We conducted a population-based case-control study with inci- dent breast cancer cases and controls selected from the communityusing random-digit dialing (RDD), frequency matched to the caseson age and race. The source population for this study was residentsof Philadelphia and Delaware Counties in Pennsylvania and ofCamden County in New Jersey. Potentially eligible cases wereAfrican American or European American women, residing inthese counties at the time of diagnosis, who were 50-79 years old and were newly diagnosed with breast cancer between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2002. The cases were identied through activesurveillance at 38 hospitals. Quarterly reviews of the PennsylvaniaCancer Registry lists were used to validate the completeness ofour case ascertainment in Pennsylvania. Additional details of ourstudy design can be found in Strom et al. 16 Women were eligible to be a breast cancer case if a pathology report was compatible with a rst primary, invasive, breast cancerof any stage (I, II, III), any grade and any tissue type (ductal, lobu-lar, mucinous, papillary, mixed). Women in situ (LCIS) and other nonma- lignant tumor types were excluded. Pathology reports and otherparts of the medical records were abstracted and reviewed in orderto validate the diagnosis. Information about tumor type, size,grade, degree of metastasis, lymph node involvement and hor-mone receptor reactivity was abstracted from the pathologyreports onto standardized abstraction forms.

Cancer: 120, 1523-1528 (2007) '2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Publication of the International Union Against Cancer Controls were selected by RDD from the same geographic regions as the cases, and frequency-matched to the cases on age (in5-year age groups), race (European or African American; Hispanicwomen who reported their race as European or African Americanwere eligible) and calendar date of interview ( 63 months). Con- trols were selected by a survey research rm that used a strict singlestage method in which every residential telephone number had anequal and known probability of selection. Control ascertainment oc-curred concurrently with case ascertainment over the period fromJuly 1, 1999 to June 30, 2002. The original plan called for equalnumbers of cases and controls. About halfway through the study,we decided to increase the control-to-case ratio to increase powerand to relax the age-matching criteria to increase the number ofAfrican American controls. To be eligible for inclusion, controls could not have a history of breast cancer. Additional eligibility criteria for both cases andcontrols included living in a noninstitutional setting, having ahousehold telephone, ability to speak English and lacking severecognitive, language or speech impairment. To minimize the poten-tial bias related to selecting controls from among individuals whoare frequently at home and who may be different from individualswho are frequently out of the house, we required up to 9 attempts atcontact at multiple times of the day and days of the week. The inter-val between diagnosis and case ascertainment could not exceed18 months, and the interval between ascertainment and contactingcases for the screening interview could not exceed 12 months.Women in the control group were interviewed within 12 monthsfrom the date of the RDD screening interview. We ascertained 1,890 incident breast cancer cases who met the age, county, diagnostic, diagnosis date and race criteria. Of these,8 were living in a nursing home, 44 did not speak English, 25were not mentally or physically able to participate, 416 did nothave physician consent, 125 were without correct address and/orphone number and 58 died before we could contact them. Another234 refused, and 31 could not be interviewed before the studyended. Of the 1,214 cases who were eligible and accessible, 949 were interviewed (50% of ascertained, 78% of those eligible and accessible). The survey research rm provided the names, addresses and tele- phone numbers for 2,381 potential RDD controls. Of these, 181were ineligible because of age, gender, county, race or history ofbreast cancer. Of those remaining, 22 could not participatebecause of physical or mental impairments, 11 did not speak English,5 were deceased, 199 could not be recontacted because theymoved or changed their phone number and 439 refused prior toviewing the research materials. The remaining 1,524 completedthe interview (64% of those referred or 78% of those eligible andaccessible). Telephone interviews were used to collect data on demographic characteristics, family history of breast, endometrial and ovariancancer, contraceptive history, fertility history, menstrual and men-opausal history, medical history, detailed gynecologic screeninghistory, use of exogenous hormones and use of other medications.The names of HRS commonly used for menopausal symptomswere included on a card mailed in advance to the study partici-pants. We specically asked about the use of steroid creams, Triestrogen and yam creams. During the interview,respondents could list up to 5 of these HRS used at least 3 times aweek for 1 month or more any time before the reference date,which was dened as the date of diagnosis for the cases and thedate of completion of the RDD screening for the controls. Statistical analysis Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% condence intervals (CIs) were cal- culated to evaluate the relationship of self-reported herbal prepara-tion use and breast cancer. Multiple conditional logistic regressionwas performed to adjust simultaneously for the matching variables(dened by combinations of age group and race) and known risk factors for breast cancer. All models were adjusted by the sameset of potential confounders: ( i) education (less than high school, high school grad, greater than high school but not a college gradu-ate or college graduate or higher), ( ii) age at rst full-term preg- nancy (nulliparous vs.age of rst live birth <20vs.age at rst live birth 20-24 vs.age of rst live birth 25-29 vs.age of rst live birth>30), ( iii) menopause status (known natural, assumed natu- ral at reference age of 50 if menopausal status is unknown and induced), ( iv) family history of breast cancer (any vs.none), ( v) ref- erence age as a continuous variable and ( vi) ever use of hormone replacement therapy. Other variables that were considered as con-founders but were not signicant predictors and did not change thepoint estimate associated with herb use by more than 10% in anyanalysis included age at menopause, use of oral contraceptives,body mass index, smoking history, history of bilateral oophorec-tomy and years of menses. Although we asked women to reporttheir use of HRS only prior to diagnosis, we considered the poten-tial for bias in use of HRS in the interval from time from diagnosisor ascertainment until interview. For this reason, we also includedthe interval from diagnosis (in cases) or ascertainment (in controls)to interview as a quartile range ( <86 days vs.87-135 days vs.136- 208 days vs.>209 days) as a potential confounder. All analyses were performed in STATA (version 9.0, STATA Corporation, College Station, TX). Results Tables I and II summarize the characteristics of our study popu- lation. As expected, there was a difference in age and race bycase-control status, and all subsequent analyses considered age and race to correct for potential confounding by these factors. Marital status and education were not different by case status, butincome level was. Table II demonstrates that many known breastcancer risk factors including menopausal status, parity and familyhistory were also shown to be breast cancer risk factors in thisstudy. However, the sample size was small when stratied byHRS use to make strong inferences about the effect of some ofthese factors in HRS users. As shown in Table III, between 10 and 20% of women in our study reported use of any HRS. This proportion varied by race.Overall, African American women were more likely to report useof any HRS than European American women (19.2% vs.14.7%, p50.003). This relationship was observed both among breast can- cer cases and controls, with 16.9% of African American cases report-ing any herbal preparation use compared with 11.4% of EuropeanTABLE I - DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF BREAST CANCER CASES AND MATCHED RDD CONTROLS IN THE PHILADELPHIA AREA, 1999-2002 Characteristic Cases ( N) Controls ( N) pvalue Age at reference date, yr (mean 6SD)63.0 (8.1) 61.8 (8.5) <0.001 Race <0.001 White 677 (43)1905 (57) Black 272 (31) 619 (69) Marital status 0.085 Never married 93 (44) 119 (56) Ever married 854 (38) 1,402 (62) Highest schooling 0.453 Less than high school 138 (39) 220 (61)High school diploma 399 (40) 595 (60) Greater than high school diploma201 (36) 352 (64) College degree 210 (37) 355 (63) Household income (pretax) 0.025 <$15,000 155 (39) 245 (61) $15,000-$45,000 342 (36) 609 (64) $45,000-$75,000 188 (37) 323 (63)>$75,000 129 (40) 190 (60) 1Values within parentheses indicate percentages.1524 REBBECK ET AL .American cases ( p50.022) and 20.2% of African American con- trols compared with 17.2% of European American controls ( p5 0.130), although this was not statistically signicant among controls.Among the more commonly used preparations, African Americanwomen were signicantly more likely than European Americanwomen Estrovin, genistein, Isoflavone, Promensil, Reju-vex, creams being used by nomore than /C241% of women in our sample (Table III). Although asked in our questionnaire, no woman reported having used daidzein. We also explored whether additional factors were predictive of use of any herbal preparation. As expected, women who had ever used hormone replacement therapy ( p50.005) or were postmeno- pausal ( p50.023) were signicantly more likely to have ever used an herbal preparation. Women who had attended college or had a college degree were also more likely to have used HRS thanwomen who had a high school education or less ( p<0.001). Women who had used oral contraceptives were more likely to use HRS than women who had never used oral contraceptives ( p5 0.011). A family history of breast cancer in a rst degree relativewas not associated with ever use of HRS ( p50.270). Women who were ever pregnant were not more likely to have used HRS (p50.505), and there was no signicant association with age at rst full term pregnancy ( p50.088). Comparing women who did and did not use a particular herbal preparation, the risk of breast cancer risk was signicantly loweramong women who reported use of any HRS compared withwomen who reported no use (adjusted OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49,0.87; Table III). Of individual preparations, only black cohoshwas signicantly associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer(adjusted OR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.70). Black cohosh is also mar-keted under the brand name Remifemin. Thus, we consideredreported use of either black cohosh or Remifemin. Six womenreported Remifemin but no black cohosh use, 88 women reportedblack cohosh but not Remifemin use, and 7 women reported using both preparations. There was a protective association between breastcancer and use of either or both compounds (adjusted OR 50.47, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.82). Also shown in Table I are comparisons of women who used a specic herbal preparation with those who had never used anyherbal preparation. The resulting inferences were identical to thoseobtained when comparing women who did and did not take a spe-cic herbal preparation (see previous paragraph). Use of tamoxifen or raloxifene may reduce breast cancer risk as well as induce menopausal symptoms, and some women using ta-moxifen or raloxifene may use HRS to address these symptoms.Therefore, we also considered the use of HRS and use of tamoxi-fen or raloxifene prior to cancer diagnosis ( i.e., as a chemopreven- tive agent, not in treatment for cancer). The power to identify suchassociations was low, since only 35 women used both tamoxifen/raloxifene and any herbal preparation and only 8 women usedboth tamoxifen/raloxifene and black cohosh. No signicant inter-action use or cohosh use ( p50.997) was ob- served. In subset analyses of women who never used tamoxifen orraloxifene, the association of any herbal preparation CI: 0.15, persisted or became stronger. Ever use of tamoxifen orraloxifene was not a signicant confounder in the relationshipbetween use of HRS or black cohosh with breast cancer. In addi-tion, the interval between reference date and interview did notchange the inferences of our study for any analysis. To further elucidate the potential mode of action of black cohosh and/or Remifemin on breast cancer protection, we explored whether the effect of these preparations on breast cancer risk reduction was associated with the hormone receptor characteristics of the tumor,namely ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status. ER/PR statuswas available on 786 (83%) of breast cancer cases. In this subset ofcases, the effect of black cohosh and/or Remifemin persistedTABLE II - CHARACTERISTICS OF BREAST CANCER CASES AND MATCHED RDD CONTROLS IN THE PHILADELPHIA AREA CharacteristicNo HRS use HRS use Cases ( N) Controls ( N) pvalue Cases ( N) mass (BMI)10.089 BMI<30 740 (40)21,090 (60) 110 (32) 236 (68) BMI/C2130 80 (35) 151 (65) 12 (21) 44 (79) Age at rst menarche 0.075 0.310 Early (/C2012) 203 (43) 264 (57) 30 (25) 92 (75) Late (/C2113) 619 (39) 973 (61) 56 (20) 223 (80) Imputed age at menopause30.371 0.603 Early (/C2050) 417 (39) 654 (61) 66 (30) 154 (70) Late (/C2150) 344 (41) 496 (59) 45 (33) 93 (67) Full term pregnancy4<0.001 0.004 Never 128 (58) 94 (42) 259 (93) 21 (7) Ever 698 (38) 1,147 (62) 102 (83) 21 (17) Oral contraceptive use 0.011 0.538 Never used 481 (43) 641 (57) 45 (32) 96 (68) Used<3 yr 167 (38) 278 (62) 28 (26) 78 (74) Used>3 yr 176 (36) 319 (64) 50 (32) 104 (68) Hormone replacement therapy use 0.335 0.280 Never 473 (41) 684 (59) 53 (28) 137 (72)Ever 353 (39) 557 (61) 70 (33) 143 (67) Cigarette smoker 0.594 0.900 Never 330 (39) 511 (61) 49 (30) 113 (70) Ever 495 (40) 730 (60) 74 (31) 166 (69) Family history of breast cancer (rst degree relatives)0.008 0.089 None 663 (39) 1,052 (61) 95 (29) 236 (71) Any 163 (46) 189 (54) 28 (39) 44 (61) Estrogen receptor positive 521 NA - 71 NA - Progesterone receptor positive 441 NA - 56 NA - 1Based on woman's usual weight when over the age decade 30-39.-2Values within parentheses indicate percentages.-3Age at menopause was imputed where unknown based on age at rst use of menopausal hormone replacement therapy, if available.-4Dened as a pregnancy longer than 26 weeks.1525 HORMONE-RELATED SUPPLEMENTS AND BREAST CANCERregardless of ER status (OR 50.35, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.96 for ER negative and OR 50.50, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.97 for ER positive tumors). In contrast, the effect of black cohosh and/or Remifeminvaried by PR status: the effect was signicant in PR positive tumors(OR50.36, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.78) in PR negative tumors (OR50.62, 95% CI: 0.30, 1.29). While very preliminary, these re- sults suggest that the effect of black cohosh and/or Remifemin maybe greater in the ER positive and PR positive groups than in ERnegative or PR negative tumors, although these differences are notlarge. In addition, these data suggest that PR activity may be relatedto the breast cancer protective effects of black cohosh/Remifeminbecause the effect of black cohosh and/or Remifemin was greaterin PR positive tumors than in PR negative tumors. Discussion With the serious health concerns that have been raised about the use of estrogen and progestin-containing hormone replacementtherapy in recent years, 17some women have turned to comple- mentary/alternative medicines to alleviate symptoms of meno-pause. The long-range effects of these compounds have not beenstudied. Therefore, we present the rst report that black cohoshconfers a degree of protection from breast cancer, which repre- sents a potentially important piece of information for women who take, or who might consider taking, these compounds. Theseresults also have implications for future research related to breastcancer chemoprevention. Black cohosh has been widely used in American and Chinese tra- ditional medicine. 18The present results are consistent with our knowledge of the biological actions of black cohosh. Black cohoshhas been reported to have benecial effects on menopausal symp-toms in some randomized clinical trials 19,20but not all.21While many phytoestrogens have proestrogenic properties, and bind ERwith a similar afnity as 17 b-estradiol itself,22black cohosh may have antiestrogenic effects that inhibit breast carcinogenesis. Blackcohosh has been inferred to be antiestrogenic by studies that show alack of estrogen-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells, 14,15,23-25 showed no competitive binding to ERs nor regulation of estrogen-inducible genes,7and protected against cellular DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species by acting as an antioxidant.26 These data are consistent with the hypothesis that black cohoshmay be associated with protection from breast cancer risk. While preliminary, we have also reported that the effect of black cohosh and/or Remifemin may differ with respect to the PR statusof breast tumors. Given the recent data suggesting that breast can-cer risk is increased among women with exposure to progestins incombined HRT, 17this provides a potentially interesting link with mechanisms of hormonally induced breast carcinogenesis. How-ever, it is not clear that use of black cohosh or Remifemin wouldnecessarily be associated with the hormonal status of the tumors.Black cohosh has hormonal effects, but its action in terms of breastcancer risk may also be related to its antiproliferative properties, 4-8 which may or may not be independent of hormone receptor statusor other hormonal hallmarks of the tumor. Furthermore, it is possi-ble that most breast tumors become estrogen/progesterone sensitiveand lose these receptors at a later stage in tumorigenesis. Thus, thehormone-mediated effects of black cohosh may remain even in ER/PR negative women, if these effects are acting on normal breastcells, early preneoplastic breast cells or breast tumor cells that haveyet to lose their hormone receptors. Studies of HRS are difcult to undertake because of limitations in data collection and the potential for study biases. We collectedinformation about major categories of ''regular'' HRS use as shownin Table III. Usage of at least 3 times weekly for at least 1 monthwas asked about to minimize misclassication of exposure. None-theless, HRS are known by a variety of names, and because theyare unregulated, may contain a variety of components and differentdosages of the advertised components. This more detailed informa-tion about specic brands or preparations was not collected, whichmay lead to misclassication of exposure in this report. Some ofthese components may be unknown to the women who used them,and there is the possibility that exposure was misclassiedbecause of variability in the naming and content of preparationsthat include black cohosh as an ingredient. Alternative therapiescontaining black cohosh are made from its roots and rhizomes.These HRS are not regulated by the FDA. Thus, the specicTABLE III - ASSOCIATION OF HORMONE-RELATED SUPPLEMENT (HRS) USE AND BREAST CANCER IN A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF WOMEN IN THE PHILADELPHIA METROPOLITAN AREA ExposureUse in European Americans Use in African Americans Ever use of specic herb vs.never use of specic HRS, OR1Ever use of specic herb HRS, Cases (N5677)Controls (N5905)Cases (N5272)Controls (N5619) Any HRS 77 (11.4)2155 46 (16.9) 125 (20.2) 0.65 [0.49-0.87]30.65 [0.49-0.87] Any phytoestrogen 20 (3.0) 44 (4.9) 20 (7.4) (7.4) 0.76 [0.48-1.21] 0.69 [0.43-1.11] Any Isoflavone or genistein 9 (0.7) 8 (1.3) 0.74 [0.32-1.67] 0.67 [0.29-1.53] Isoflavone 9 (1.3) 17 (1.9) 0 5 (0.8) ND4ND4 Genistein 0 2 (0.2) 2 (0.7) 3 (0.5) ND4ND4 Red clover 2 (0.3) 8 (0.9) 13 (4.8) 29 (4.7) 0.78 [0.38-1.61] 0.70 [0.33-1.47]Soy medications 11 (1.6) 21 (2.3) 6 (2.2) 14 (2.2) 0.81 [0.39-1.67] 0.69 [0.33-1.44] Black cohosh or Remifemin 40 (6.5) 0.47 [0.27-0.82] 0.44 [0.25-0.77] Black cohosh 13 (1.9) 34 (3.8) 9 (3.3) 39 (6.3) 0.39 [0.22-0.70] 0.37 [0.20-0.66]Remifemin 3 (0.4) 6 (0.7) 2 (0.7) 2 (0.3) ND 4ND4 Biestrogen 0 1 (0.1) 0 0 ND4ND4 DHEA 8 (1.2) 16 (1.8) 2 (0.7) 4 (0.7) ND4ND4 Dong quai 12 (1.8) 21 (2.3) 9 (3.3) 20 (3.2) 0.83 [0.43-1.59] 0.75 [0.39-1.45]Estrovin 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) 3 (1.1) 7 (1.1) ND4ND4 Ginseng 41 (6.1) 84 (9.3) 31 (11.4) 80 (12.9) 0.74 [0.53-1.06] 0.75 [0.53-1.06] Promensil 1 (0.2) 4 (0.4) 0 2 (0.3) ND4ND4 Rejuvex 7 (1.0) 10 (1.1) 2 (0.7) 8 (1.3) ND4ND4 Steroid creams 6 (0.9) 13 (1.4) 1 (0.4) 3 (0.5) ND4ND4 Yam creams 5 (0.7) 10 (1.1) 1 (0.4) 4 (0.7) ND4ND4 1The odds ratio (OR) represents the relationship of herbal exposure and breast cancer risk as estimated from conditional logistic regression matched on age and race, and adjusted for the following variables: ( i) education (less than high school, high school grad, greater than high school but not a college graduate, or college graduate or higher), ( ii) age at rst full-term pregnancy (nulliparous vs.age of rst live birth <20vs.age at rst live birth 20-24 vs.age of rst live birth 25-29 vs.age of rst live birth >30), ( iii) menopause status (known natural, assumed natural at ref- erence age of 50 if menopausal status is unknown, and induced), ( iv) family history of breast cancer (any vs.none), ( v) time from diagnosis/ ascertainment vs.87-135 days vs.136-208 days vs.>209 days), ( vi) reference age as a continuous variable and ( vii) ever use of hormone replacement therapy.-2Values within parentheses indicate percentages.-3Values within square brackets indicate 95% CIs.-4Odds ratio associations not undertaken due to limited number of women who used this preparation.1526 REBBECK ET AL .content of these preparations is not uniform, and it may be difcult to identify specic content and dosage of black cohosh in manypreparations. Black cohosh extract is sold under a variety of labelscontaining doses of the triterpene glycoside 26-deoxyactein. Blackcohosh is also sold in tablet form, including the brand Remifemin(Enzymatic Therapy, Green Bay, WI), containing 20 mg of rootper tablet. However, it is not always clear what specic compoundsor doses have been consumed, and therefore misclassication orreporting bias could limit the inferences made in this report. Similarly, our study has the potential for differential recall bias between cases and controls. While we specically asked womenabout their consumption of HRS prior to the time of cancer diagno- sis or the reference date in controls, differential reporting of herbal preparation use by cancer status could have biased our results. Par-ticipants who refused participation did so before knowing about thequestions regarding herbal preparation use. Therefore, knowledgeof our hypotheses was unlikely to have affected participation, andit is unlikely that refusal was differential with respect to the hypoth-eses studied here. However, if potential controls who used HRSwere more likely to agree to participate, and this participation wasdifferent than in cases, then our results could be biased toward aprotective effect of herbal preparation use. Finally, there has been asuggestion that the timing of phytoestrogen exposure ( e.g., early in life) may influence the effects of these compounds on breast cancerrisk. 27While self-reported exposure to these agents was prediagno- sis, we did not have data regarding timing of exposures. We didconsider the interval from diagnosis in cases or reference date incontrols to interview, and the adjustment for this variable did notaffect the inferences found in Table I. Future studies should con-sider the timing and duration of black cohosh use in order to betterdetermine dose-response relationships. Other exposures may influence the associations described here. For example, use of antibiotics or other agents that may alter thegastrointestinal flora that metabolize phytoestrogens may influ-ence the observed associations between HRS and breast cancer.Confounding by other factors, particularly diet and physical activ- ity may have influenced our results. We have explored adjust- ments for smoking and alcohol consumption, which were not sig-nicant confounders in our analysis. However, these adjustmentsare not optimal surrogate confounders for other relevant factorsand additional studies should consider whether diet, physical ac-tivity or other exposures confound the relationship reported here.Women who take black cohosh and other HRS may have dietsrich in other compounds that influence breast cancer risk, therebyconfounding the relationship of herb use with breast cancer risk.Similarly, women who use these compounds may have lifestyles that involve physical activity or other exposures that differ fromwomen who do not. While we did not have detailed dietary orphysical activity information in this study, we did attempt toadjust for possible confounders including smoking and alcoholconsumption history. Neither of these factors was a signicantconfounder in our analysis. Indeed, the raw (unadjusted) OR asso-ciation for black cohosh use was not substantially different thanthe adjusted OR in our nal adjusted analysis. In summary, black cohosh has been previously shown to have antiproliferative, antiestrogenic and antioxidant properties, and iseffective in the management of menopausal symptoms. However, side effects of black cohosh use have been reported, 28there have been suggestions that black cohosh may influence breast cancerseverity phenotype in a mouse model,29and the specic content and dose of preparations containing black cohosh are not alwaysknown. Therefore, substantial additional research must be under-taken before it can be established that black cohosh, or some com-pound found in black cohosh, is a breast cancer chemopreventiveagent. Furthermore, women may wish to seek guidance from theirphysician before using these compounds, and the data presentedhere do not suggest that use of black cohosh is an appropriate sub-stitute for standard hormone replacement therapy.
