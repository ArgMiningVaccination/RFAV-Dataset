ADVANCE RESEARCH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCE 2020 The coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, has infected more than 5.8 million people with over 351,000 deaths around the world. India is one of the faster-infected countries where tentatively 89,000 active cases, 86,000 discharged or cured and 5150 deaths reported as per the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare by the end of May 2020. The people of India are already beyond their all extreme capacities, and patience due to the phase-wise lockdown imposed more than two months, i.e. since 24 th March 2020. They are now waiting to rejoin in their work and resume their suspended services from 8th June (unlock phase-1). COVID-19 infections and death affected not only people's physical and mental health but also the entire economy as well as per capita income due to closures of almost all industries. In this review article, we are concern about essential nutrition through the daily average staple meals based on a much lower budget than usual due to financial troubles in the middle-class families and other classes as well. The only option to be healthy is by adding immunity-boosting foods that are not only cheap and best but readily available in our daily diet. In this COVID-19 phases, Indian people can exclusively rely on traditional foods as an immunity elevator such as spices, citrus fruits, some vegetables, herbal tea, honey, etc. The article, therefore, provides an overview of the home-based simple practice of diet based on online searches of relevant literature available in NCBI, Embase, other useful databases including Google scholar. The study overall reviews the values of Ayurveda, nutrition, yoga, and health benefits by protecting and boosting immunity. Journal of Science and Technology 2020 Now a days the news of coronavirus is on all news paper's headline. Coronavirus is spreading from animal market of Wuhan in central China. There are several types of coronavirus but all are not dangerous but this new coronavirus is very dangerous. It is a group of RNA viruses that cause a variety of disease in animal and animal to human. The efficiency of this new coronavirus found in the live animal market of Wuhan in central China, circulate in a range of animals and spread from animal to animal and animal to human also which is called Spillover. Mild symptoms of coronavirus are cough, shortness of breath and severe problems are pneumonia, kidney failure and death also. Basically corona virus effects on immune systems and decrease the immune power. There are no specific treatments or vaccines for this disease still now. So in this condition, people have to maintain immunity and should increase immune power to fight against coronavirus. Only washing hand and wearing a mask are not enough to fight against this virus, people have to modify their daily diet. This article summarizes the immune-boosting therapeutic diet against coronavirus (COVID-19). A Final Sequel To Islamic & Prophet Medcine Use of succulent bio-medicines to control COVID-19 2020 Use of succulent bio-medicines and other succulent bio-healthcare products can bring a dramatic change in initiation, progression as well as expression of symptoms of various diseases among individuals. Succulent parts of some effective medicinal plants in the form of paste or pressure extract can be covered by some digestible capsular materials of biological origin without addition of any synthetic chemical and may be used as preventive oral medicines against COVID-19. Plants having ethnomedicinal reports of having strong immunomodulation and antioxidation activities and plants having role in protection of respiratory organs may be selected for such use to strengthen the immunity power of the people to become refractory to the viral infections. Name of such medicinal plants with relevant parts and previous reports on their related activities, discussion of various steps related with preparation of a design for efficacy based study on the medicines and their dose determination; production, marketing and transport of these medicines up to the patient level; searching of answer of the questions raised against such herbal medicines and discussion of pros and cons of the use of such medicines are added in this book. A brief analysis of possible mechanism of actions of the succulent bio-medicines is also included in this book. [ISBN: 978-93-5407-265-9] Herbal & Alternative Natural Remedies A Sequel And Final stages of Completion to Prophetic Medicine Nutraceuticals have received considerable zest for their expected safety, potential nutritive and therapeutic effects. These were used as alternative to modern medicines that promote quality of health, increases nutritive value of the diet and prolongs life expectancy. Major constituents of the nutraceuticals are herbals, various nutrients and dietary supplements are involved in preventing different diseases and minimizing pathophysiology of the disease too. It also acts as immune boosting, natural antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, organoprotective agent in addition with different health promoting effects. Ultimately, they ensure better quality of life and the purpose of this review is to provide summary of current scientific impression in this regard which might be helpful to formulate further innovative research plan in new domain on nutraceuticals. Curr Trends Pharm Res 2020 Background: There have been various infectious pandemic or epidemic diseases that cause morbidity in living being. The disease causing microbes can spread from one person to another in a very short range of time, again change in environmental factors drive these pathogens to mutate and make it more vulnerable, so, the available drug become resistant to treat it. At the same time development of new drug or vaccine or treatment process requires more time. To resolve these problems strengthening the immune system is important. Objective: The objective of this review to provide a brief insight about the human immune system and various strategies to strengthen the immune system. Methods: Extensive literature survey was carried out and information from various databases viz. Pubmed, Medline, Google scholar etc., were retrieved for analysis. Results and Discussion: Several immunostimulants are found that modulate the immune system of host by inducing activation or increasing activity of its components and thereby increase resistance against various infections. Moreover, certain food and nutrients also give good options to build resilience against infection. The link between immune system with diet, exercise, sleep, stress, microbial exposure, alcohol, water, hygiene are found to influence the immune response to a greater extent. Conclusion: Immunostimulants and some immunity enhancing nutrients improves the functioning of the immune system. In addition, some preventive measures such as healthy diet or proper nutrition, moderate exercise, sound sleep, drinking adequate water, subclinical exposure to microbes and managing stress, good hygiene, are altogether capable of boosting the immune system.
