Their strength and courage inspire me to do my best each day to deliver the best care possible in the clinic and in the operating room.\" - Dr. Amy Lee is an attending neurosurgeon at Seattle Children's Hospital. She is also a Professor of Neurological Surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Dr. Lee received her undergraduate degree from the College of William and Mary. She then received her M.D. from the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. She went on to complete a seven-year Neurological Surgery Residency at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine/Barnes Jewish Hospital. She spent six months as a specialist registrar in neurosurgery at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. She then went on to complete her Pediatric Neurosurgery Fellowship at St. Louis Children's Hospital. - Related Resources - - - - We will be ever so grateful for Dr. Amy Lee. It was back in 2016 that we met her. Our son was born 8 weeks early and needed a shunt placed and he was only 3 pounds and 7 ounces when she performed that surgery and i couldn't have asked for a smarter, kinder, knowledgeable person to perform his surgery that day. Just speaking with her gave me a sense of calmness about the situation and we knew she genuinely cared. To this day or son has multiple shunt revisions including 2 at a neighboring hospital when they couldn't perform surgeries and Dr. Lee is still the only one who can place the catheter in the brain somehow that it don't clog and every shunt surgery she has performed we have gotten at least a year outta them shunts. All the others that get placed for some odd reason last only 30 or days 45 days max. When we get to children's and confirm our suspicion I instantly start praying Dr. Amy Lee will perform his surgery. If your child is in her care they are in the best hands possible. - Dr. Lee is a thoughtful, careful, competent and brilliant Neurosurgeon. She internalized our daughters shunt, has met with us for countless clinic appointments to go over radiology imaging, and recently performed a shunt revision. She communicates clearly, she is patient to answer our sometimes rediculous questions, and she obviously cares for her patients. We would give Dr. Lee 5/5 stars!! - Dr. Lee is not only an accomplished neurosurgeon but a fabulous communicator. She and her team helped us navigate a very perplexing case with our daughter. They provided us with all of the information and expertise to make the right decision. Post op - Dr. Lee was very reassuring and could relate with our daughter on a level that provided her with comfort as well. - Dr. Lee is an incredible person. Not just an incredible surgeon, but an incredible person. She was a key player in saving our son's life. Thank you, Dr. Lee. - Dr. Lee performed a surgery to remove a tumor in my daughter's spinal cord on 2/24/15. She's an excellent surgeon. The surgery was very successful and we think that she's not just a good doctor but a real life saver. She's also very caring and willing to listen to you. Our daughter was so lucky to have her as one of the surgeons. - When my younger son complained of a lump on his head I thought he had just bumped it on the ceiling of the basement stairwell he is growing so fast. I was shocked when a CT scan showed a lesion in a bone in his skull, and he needed to have neurosurgery. However, because of Dr. Amy Lees surgical expertise, my boy was back to normal and back to school in a matter of days. Neurosurgery can never be considered \"routine\", yet because of her compassionate and skilled care, the only thing noticeably different about my son is his haircut. It is abundantly clear that she is completely devoted to her work, and for that, I am forever grateful. - Dr. Amy Lee is an excellent surgeon as well as a very approachable person with a great sense of humor. She interacts really well with us, the parents, as well as our baby girl. It's great that our daughter can have such a nice, female neurosurgeon as a role model so early in her life. - Dr. Lee was part of my infant son's surgical team for CVR to treat his craniosynostosis. She was incredibly calm and kind and explained her role to us thoroughly. We felt so lucky to have such a great team. He recovered and healed remarkably well and all the doctors are pleased with his progress so far after such an intricate procedure. I'm glad Dr. Lee will be with us for the next surgery as well. You are in good hands if she is on your team.
