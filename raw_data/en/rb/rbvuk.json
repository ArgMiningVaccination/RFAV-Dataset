The Tokio Marine Group conducts its businesses on a global scale as an insurance group . In this context, the Company has established sound and highly transparent corporate governance and internal control systems, and appropriately governs its group companies, as an insurance holding company which oversees the group . 2. The Board of Directors of the Company, which is a compan y with an Audit & Supervisory Board, not only decides on important matters of business execution, but also oversees the execution of duties by Directors. In order for the Board of Directors to fulfill its role appropriately, it is necessary for the Board a s a whole to possess the necessary skills, based on factors such as the nature of Tokio Marine Group's businesses, its business development, governance structure, etc. Moreover, the necessary skills will change with the business environment. 3. In order to decide on and oversee important matters of its business execution of the Company , it is first necessary to gain a deep understanding of its businesses - in other words, to be closely familiar with \" Insurance Business .\" In addition, skills in the fields of \"Finance & Economy,\" \"Accounting,\" \"Legal & Compliance,\" \"Human Resource Strategies ,\" \"Governance & Risk Management\" form the basis for judgment on all matters. Moreover, with the tremendous technological innovation in recent years, and the increasingly vital part played by \"Technology\" in business transformation, the importance of skills in this field are becoming ever more important. In addition, as the global environment and technological innovation are becoming an issue for society as a w hole in recent years, the importance of \"environmental\" and \"technological\" skills is increasing. Furthermore, skills including \" Internationality \" and \" Corporate Management \" are expected, especially of Outside Directors. This is because an awareness of the global environment and insight into corporate management are extremely useful for the Tokio Marine Group, which conducts its businesses on a global scale. 4. Regarding Audit & Supervisory Board Members, the Audit & Supervisory Board should also be compose d of Members collectively possessing the skills required of the Board of Directors above, in order to appropriately audit the execution of duties by Directors. Among these, \" Accounting \" are designated as particularly important skills. 5. The table on the p revious page shows the Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members (expected) after this meeting , and the skills they possess. The Company considers that, collectively, they possess the necessary skills. 43 Reference Independence Standards for Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members (Tokio Marine Holdings Fundamental Corporate Governance Policy Exhibit ) Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members of the Company are judged to be independent from the C ompany if they do not fall within any of the following categories : (i) an executive of the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; (ii) a person who has been an executive of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliate of the Company in the past ten years; (iii) a party whose major client or supplier is the Company or a principal business subsidiary of the Company (a party whose transactions with the Company or a principal business subsidiary of the Company in the most recent fiscal year amount to 2% or more of its consolidated net sales), or an executive thereof; (iv) a party who is a major client or supplier of the Company or a principal business subsidiary of the Company (a party whose transactions with the Company or a principal business subsidiary of the Company in the most recent fiscal year amount to 2% or more of consolidated ordinary income of the Company), or an executive thereof; (v) a financial institution or other major creditor which the Company or a principal business subsidiary of the Company r elies on to the extent that it is an indispensable funding source that cannot be replaced, or an executive thereof; (vi) an executive of a corporation or an association or any other organization that receives donations from the Company or a principal busin ess subsidiary of the Company in excess of a certain amount in the most recent fiscal year (10 million yen or 2% of the total revenue of such organization in the most recent fiscal year, whichever is larger); (vii) a spouse or relative within the third deg ree of kinship of a Director, Audit & Supervisory Board Member, or Executive Officer of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliate of the Company; (viii) a consultant, accountant, lawyer, or other specialist who receives compensation from the Company or a principal business subsidiary of the Company other than compensation for Directors, Audit & Supervisory Board Members and Executive Officers of the Company or a principal business subsidiary of the Company in excess of a certain amount in the most recent fiscal year (10 million yen or 2% of the total revenue of a corporation or association or any other organization to which such specialist belongs in the most recent fiscal year, whichever is larger); or (ix) a party who holds 10% or more of the voting righ ts of all shareholders of the Company at the end of the most recent fiscal year, or an executive thereof. 44 [English Translation ] TOKIO MARINE HOLDINGS, INC.

As to the consolidated fiscal year end, net income attributable to owners of the parent reached a record high of 420.4 billion yen due to an increase in income in the domestic property and casualty insurance business due to a decrease in incurred insurance amount related to domestic natural disasters, etc. as well as an increase in income in the overseas insurance business due to favorable insurance underwriting and asset management.

Under its direction, employees from al l across Japan were dispatched to the affected area to strengthen systems for the payment of insurance claims. Tokio Marine & Nichido also undertook a nationwide earthquake response, including the cooperation of offices across Japan in receiving notice of insurance accidents and paying insurance claims, using the system platform it had prepared in advance for emergencies. The provision of insurance claim s services in general, not limited to the response to natural disasters, is a crucial area where non-life insurance companies can achieve customer recognition for their value. The Group as a whole will work as a team to respond with insurance claims services, striving to bring a sense of security to customers as early as possible. We have engaged in realizin g the best mix of people and digitalization services through the active utilization of unique digital tools to insurance claim s services , as well as customer -focused response by employees and agents. These efforts to redesign customer contact points and bu siness processes to be simpler and more user -friendly have been recognized, with Tokio Marine & Nichido awarded in the GOOD DESIGN AWARD 2021, organized by the Japan Institute of Design Promotion. With disaster prevention and mitigation becoming prominent social issues, Tokio Marine & Nichido launched the Disaster Prevention Consortium (CORE), a collaboration with a number of companies from various industries, etc., with the same purpose aimed at building a resilient society by engaging in the enhancement o f four elements of disaster prevention and mitigation: grasping 46 the current situation, implementing countermeasures, evacuation, and rebuilding lives. To help build a resilient society that will withstand disasters, the consortium combines \"knowledge\" and \"innovative technologies\" across industry boundaries to create solutions that contribute to disaster prevention and mitigation and implement these in society through collaboration between companies, countries, and municipalities. Amid rising expectations for the renewable energy business against the backdrop of global warming and climate change, we supported renewable energy businesses in ways such as providing products and services to give offshore wind power generation businesses total support from construction through operation, as an initiative to \"create new markets by contributing to solving social issues.\" In addition, we utilize the solution website \"BUDDY+\" to provide one -stop services from related information to solutions, to support the endeavors of small and medium -sized companies, the mainstay of the Japanese economy. We have established a system to offer proposals of products and services optimized for each company, by utilizing technology to accurately grasp each compa ny's needs. We have engaged in \"building a lean business operation,\" including through digital transformation (DX), and \"enhance profitability of insurance business\" through measures such as revising premium rates for fire insurance, to enable us to contin ue the stable provision of products and services to respond to any change in the environment, including more intense natural disasters. <Results of Domestic Property and Casualty Insurance Business > Domestic Life Insurance Business Life insurance premiums : 567.5 billion yen Ordinary profit: 69.5 billion yen Composition ratio of premiums written: 11.6 % Tokio Marine & Nichido Life was founded in 1996 to be a \"customer -oriented and innovative life insurance business,\" and marked its mi lestone 25th anniversary in August 2021. Since its founding, it has constantly engaged in developing and selling highly -original products based on an accurate grasp of customer needs. As a result, it has received the support and patronage of many customers . This has enabled it to maintain one of the top growth rates in the industry throughout its history. In fiscal year 2021, we continued to promote the \"Life Insurance Resolution to Protect One's Living\" initiative, which provides coverage in fields such as inability to work and nursing care, while utilizing the key strength of the Group's business model, integrating life insurance and property and casualty insurance. We actively promoted our busin ess with the launch of new products that were well received by customers. These included a pension and nursing care 47 insurance product \"Anshin Nenkin Kaigo R\" which enables customers to prepare for the unexpected situation while also providing them with hea lth rebate payments at a predesignated age, and \"Anshin Cancer Treatment Insurance,\" which adds up to a maximum coverage of 100 million yen to enable customers to receive the latest cancer treatments, etc., which are sometimes costly. We promoted initiatives to reduce interest rate risk amid persistent low interest rates. In addition to endeavoring to expand our range of protection -type products with low interest rate risk, we continued to conduct asset management based on Asset Liability Managemen t (ALM). <Results of Domestic Life Insurance Business > Overseas Insurance Business Premiums written: 1,849.3 billion yen Ordinary profit: 185.5 billion yen Composition ratio of premiums written: 37.9 % The Group has actively expanded business in developed countries and emerging countries in a balanced manner working on both sustainable organic growth and strategic M&As with the aim of achieving global growth and diversified portfolio construction for the entire Group. In addition, by mutual leveraging of the excellent know -how held by Group companies, the Group has continued to implement a wide range of efforts toward the realization of synergies such as increasing premium income, advancing investment management, raising business effici ency and other measures. We aimed to achieve steady business growth at each of our offices around the world, and engaged in improving and expanding our underwriting profit, including by raising insurance premium rates based on the market environment. We we re also able to achieve good results in terms of asset management by accurately capturing the timing of the recovery in business conditions. As a result, many overseas Group companies performed strongly, led by the three core North American companies, whic h recorded their highest ever profits. The overseas insurance business as a whole also achieved its highest ever level of profit. The main overseas Group companies continued to engage in \"bolt -on\" M&A activities to strengthen their existing businesses as p art of their growth strategy. The companies' strong performance in fiscal year 2021 was partly attributable to their past efforts in this area. In fiscal year 2021, Delphi Financial Group acquired a United States insurance company with a distinctive busine ss model through its life insurance subsidiary. 48 <Results of Three Core North American Companies > Philadelphia HCC Delphi Financial and Other Business Ordinary income: 102.3 billion yen Ordinary profit: 9.6 billion yen In the financial and other businesses, the Group developed our financial services steadily with a focus on our asset management business, which offers a stable revenue base. Such business includes the management of pension funds and the management of investment trusts, and has been highly evaluated by customers. 49 Contributing to a Sustainable Society The Toki o Marine Group has grown sustainably over the long term by contributing to the resolution of various social issues specific to each era, based on the Group's Purpose since the time of its founding, \"protecting customers and society in times of need.\" Acros s its global operations, the Group will continue working to benefit society, bring happiness to people , and protect the global environment in order to help build a sustainable society and simultaneously enhance the Group's social value and economic value. In April 2021, with the aim of accelerating the implementation of sustainability strategies across the entire Group, we newly appointed a Chief Officer responsible for overseeing Group sustainability, and established the Sustainability Committee, composed of the Group CEO, Chief Officers, and others. We also established subcommittees under the Sustainability Committee to consider specific sustainability issues in each field. In this way, we established a strong structure for the promotion of sustainability strategy . In September 2021, we added a clause to the policies regarding insurance underwriting and investment and financing set forth in \"Tokio Marine: Our Climate Strategy,\" stating that we would not engage in transactions related to thermal coal mining projects. In December 2021, we went on to establish our \"Policy to Address Environmental and Social Risk,\" enhancing our systems to appropriatel y ascertain and manage risks with a negative impact on the environment and society. Based on the Paris Agreement, we established the following targets for fiscal year 2030: reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the Group's business activities by 60% (comp ared to fiscal year 2015), and increasing the proportion of renewable energy for electricity consumed at major offices to 100%. We expanded the use of renewable energy at our major offices in Japan, the United States , and Europe as the first step towards a chieving these targets. We have continuously engaged in mangrove planting activities in 9 countries in the Asia -Pacific region, in collaboration with tree -planting NGOs, etc., since 1999. The Tokio Marine Group has achieved carbon -neutral status for the gr eenhouse gas emissions from its business activities for 8 consecutive years to fiscal year 2020, partly through the fixation of CO 2 in these mangrove plantations. In December 2021, we were the first Japanese insurance company to join the Net -Zero Insurance Alliance led by the United Nations. We are actively involved in international rule -making for the insurance industry aiming to realize a society with net -zero greenhouse gas emissions and engaged in initiatives to establish frameworks suited to each count ry's conditions. Disseminating Group Culture and Promoting D&I The Tokio Marine Group has grown as a global insurance group by increasing its partners through initiatives such as overseas M&A. In this context, the dissemination of Group culture is vital to enable Group companies around the world to build their sense of solidarity and strengthen employee engagement worldwide. It is from this perspective that the Group CEO has been appointed Chief Officer in charge of overseeing Group culture, actively engaging in direct dialogue 50 about the Tokio Marine Group's Purpose and other issues wi th employees around the world, at forums such as town hall -style meetings. We carry out fixed -point observations through the culture and value survey implemented at Group companies in Japan and overseas. The results of the survey indicate steady progress i n the dissemination of Group culture. Diversity of human resources is the driver for growth. The Tokio Marine Group, based on its Purpose, supports the initiatives and challenges of each individual employee with the aim of encouraging employees to make eve n greater use of their creativity and expertise. Through diversity and inclusion (D&I), we are creating environments where new innovations can be born. In April 2021, we appointed a Chief Officer to oversee D&I and established the Diversity Council to further accelerate these endeavors. The elimination of the gender gap has become an important issue in Japan. Tokio Marine & Nichido is fully committed to resolving this issue. It has already achieved its target of increasing the proportion of female employees in associate middle -management positions to 50% or more by fiscal year 2023, ahead of schedule, and has established a new target of raising the proportion of female managers and officers in middle management above to 30% or more by fiscal year 2030. Refe rence: We were selected as \"Health & Productivity Stock\" (for the 7th consecutive year), as a result of our promotion of health and productivity management under the Tokio Marine Group Wellness Charter, centered around the Chief Officer responsible for Gro up health and productivity management. Issues Facing the Group The world economy is forecast to continue a moderate recovery in fiscal year 2022, primarily in the United States. However, with a sense of uncertainty over the renewed spread of COVID -19 and the situation in Ukraine, there are also fears of the possible i mpact of high inflation and tighter monetary policy. In the Japanese economy, an upturn in personal consumption is expected due to the normalization of economic activity, but concerns remain, including inflation rate rise and cooling consumer sentiment due to factors such as the situation in Ukraine. The Tokio Marine Group will boldly and proactively take on new challenges to achieve our long - term vision \"to be a global insurance group that delivers sustainable growth by providing safety and security to cus tomers worldwide.\" In fiscal year 2022, the second year of the plan \" Tokio Marine Group Mid -term Business Plan 2023 ~Adapt, Lead, Innovate~, \" we will actively promote a \"2+1 growth strategy,\" engaging in initiatives with a dual focus of \"new markets x new approaches\" to respond accurately to rapidly -changing customer needs, and \"enhance profitability of insurance business\" with more efficient operations through the appropriate adjustment of insurance premium rates and the use of digital technology, while i nvesting in our businesses for the next stage of growth, in order to achieve the mid -term business plan . In order to realize a sustainable society, we will promote the dissemination of the Basic Policy on Environment and Basic Policy on Human Rights across the entire Group, under the organizational structure for promoting sustainability established in fiscal year 2021. We will also push ahead vigorously with our sustainability strategies aimed at resolving social issues, through initiatives in each business segment to put these into practice. 51 In the domestic property and cas ualty insurance business, Tokio Marine & Nichido will enhance its function as a total solution provider to address the uncertainties and risks experienced by customers, not only through its main insurance business but also through working to prevent accide nts in advance and facilitate swift recovery and preventing recurrence after accidents have occurred. As one of these initiatives, in April 2022, we renewed our support structure for the emergency hotline service attached to products such as cyber risk ins urance to provide customers with one -stop service from a specialist team, ranging from advice on the initial response to cyberspace -related trouble to support for the establishment of response plans and making insurance claims. We will continue to develop and provide a wide range of solutions. In the domestic life insurance business, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life will focus on domains such as seniors, healthcare, and asset formation. By providing unique products to customers through optimal sales channels in each domain, we will contribute to resolving social issues in the 100 -year lifespan era . In the overseas insurance business, we will continuously and stably expand underwriting profits by increasing premium income by leveraging advanced underwriting capabi lities and expertise, and by raising appropriate premium rates in anticipation of future increases in insurance payment. In addition, we will steadily grow U.S. company Pure, which has joined Tokio Marine Group in recent years, and our joint venture compa ny with a major state -owned banking group in Brazil. At the same time, we will work to expand synergies in the overall overseas insurance business, including the global development of competitive products and the sophistication of asset management. We will also continue to conduct market trend surveys aimed at executing strategic M&A, steadily capturing outstanding investment opportunities. Regarding asset management, we will continue to strive to strengthen our global asset management approach based on Asset Liability Management (ALM) , in collaboration with Group companies in Japan and overseas. In addition, we will endeavor to secure long -term stable investment income and maintain a sound financial base by diversifying our asset portfolio as well as risks, while closely monitoring changes in the world economy and financial markets. The Group's basic policy for shareholder returns is to dist ribute profit by payment of dividends. Based on the idea that profit growth through business and dividend expansion should be consistent, during the period of the current medium -term business plan, we will strive to realize continuous dividend increases th rough strong profit growth and an increase in the dividend payout ratio. Under our management philosophy to place \"customer trust at the base of all its activities,\" the entire Group will endeavor to achieve further growth as a corporate group, seeking de velopment characterized by high profitability and sustainability based on a sound and transparent governance structure. We plan on building up a \"Good Company\" that is trusted widely by customers and the society. We would like to express our sincere apprec iation to all shareholders of Tokio Marine Holdings for their continued guidance and support. Notes: 1.

Internal Control System in General The Company has formulated its \"Basic Policies for Internal Controls\" and, in accordance with these Policies, the Company has established an internal control system for the entire Group including management control of group companies, compliance, risk management, internal audits and audits by Audit & Supervisory Board Members, through which it endeavors to ensure proper operations while raising corporate value. The Company monitors the status and practical application of the Internal Control System, and the Board of Direct ors confirms the details of the monitoring based on deliberations at the Internal Control Committee. In fiscal year of 2021, we conducted deliberations with external experts and confirmed that there are no significant deficiencies in internal control acros s the whole Group. 83 b. Efforts related to Management Control of Group Companies The Company has formulated various basic policies that the Group is required to comply with in order to ensure proper Group operations and to ensure compliance with laws, re gulations and the Articles of Incorporation of the Company. The Company also reviews the policies each year to determine whether any new policies or revisions to existing policies are necessary and the Company has revised a part of such basic policies fisc al year of 2021. In the Group's basic policies about management of Group companies, certain material items relating to the businesses of the Company's major Group companies for which prior approval from or report to the Company is required are identified. In accordance with these policies, the Company gives prior approval to business and other plans of major Group companies. c. Efforts related to Compliance The Group conducts training each year to inform directors and officers of laws, regulation s and internal rules that directors and officers are required to comply with. The Group has also installed hotlines for directors and officers to report internally regarding potential compliance issue s and, as wel l as spread ing awareness about the use of these hotlines and whistleblower protection, etc. through training and other methods , the Group is responding to reports . In addition, the Group installed a hotline that can handle internal reports in multiple languages from Japan and abroad. In order to continuously enhance the compliance system across the whole Group, the Group, under the leadership of a chief officer who oversees legal affairs and compliance throughout the Group, is making particular efforts to develop a system for fields that require global responses, such as the prevention of bribery and the protection of personal information. d. Efforts related to Risk Management The Company identifies risks that may have material effect on the financial soundness and continuity of operations of the Company, establishes countermeasures against such risks, deliberates on the implementation of such countermeasures at the Internal Con trol Committee and confirms their effectiveness at board of directors' meetings. In recent years, while natural disasters have become more large scale and frequent, the risks surrounding businesses , such as the novel coronavirus and cyber terrorism , have become more diverse. In the fiscal year of 2021, we worked to strengthen our readiness to respond to scenarios such as an earthquake making a direct hit on Tokyo and a volcanic eruption of Mt. Fuji by conducting large -scale simulation drills together with domestic Group companies. From the standpoint of responding to cyber risks, we worked to strengthen our global posture by establishing a system to conduct security management across the Group. In order to maintain credit ratings and forestall bankruptcy, t he Board of Directors conducts a multi - faceted investigation to confirm that the Group's real net assets are at a sufficient level compared to the risks the Group faces and confirms that financial soundness is maintained. 84 e. Efforts related to Internal Audits In order to achieve management objectives effectively, the Company conducts internal audits of the operations of each department, and offers recommendations regarding improvements for any issues that are identified. In addition, we request Group companies to conduct efficient and effective internal audits in accordance with the type and degree of risk, while monitoring the implementation status of internal audits at Group companies and the status of their internal control systems, mainly thr ough reports of the results of their internal audits. In particular, for small and medium -sized Group companies, we take action such as collaborat ion initiatives with major Group companies to strengthen internal audit functions and provide support for impr oving internal audit quality. f. Efforts to Ensure Effective Audits by Audit & Supervisory Board Members The Company provides information to Audit & Supervisory Board Members sufficient to ensure effective audit by Audit & Supervisory Board Members such as by having them attend meetings of the Board of Directors and other important meetings, as well as provid ing them access to important financial reports, which allows them to evaluate directors' execution of their duties. The Company's Internal Audit Department also collaborates with Audit & Supervisory Board Members by providing information on the internal au dit plan and the outcome of the internal audit. In addition, the Company reports to Audit & Supervisory Board Members 4 times a year on the implementation of the internal reporting hotline. 9.
