Fluorescence microscopy is routinely used to determine spatial and topological information about cells and tissues. Sophisticated laser scanning microscopic instrumentation, ultra sensitive digital cameras and specialized fluorescence probes make it possible to visualize cellular events in real time down to the molecular level.
