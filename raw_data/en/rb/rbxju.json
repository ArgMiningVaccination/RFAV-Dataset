[Learn more](https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-reviews-expertise-in-product-reviews) Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that's believed to support strong bones and help reduce the risk of fractures as we age. It may also play a role in our mood and immune health, while some studies suggest it could reduce the risk of major diseases like heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. And you've likely heard it called the \" [sunshine vitamin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356951/),\" too. This is because our bodies actually produce it autonomously when our skin is exposed to the sun's UVB rays. But sun alone isn't an adequate source of vitamin D for everyone. Folks living in northern climates may not get consistent quality sun exposure, and various factors like age and skin tone make some people's bodies less efficient at producing vitamin D. Plus, sun exposure can cause adverse [effects](https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/sun-damage) like photoaging (i.e. wrinkles, discoloration, loss of elasticity) and skin cancer. \"From my clinical experience, it's fairly rare for the average person to be deficient but many people have suboptimal levels,\" Anne Dahany, MS, RDNs, told Insider. \"They notice improvements in mood (especially depression) and less fatigue with supplements. Higher levels are linked to immune health benefits and a lower risk of many chronic diseases.\" Not everyone needs a higher vitamin D intake and because it's fat-soluble rather than water-soluble, it's possible to take in too much. It's recommended you ask your doctor to run a blood test to find out if your vitamin D levels are fine or lacking. If your doctor tells you to start supplementing, your next step is to figure out which one. I spoke to [three medical experts](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-vitamin-d-supplements#our-experts-9) about [what to look for in a vitamin D supplement](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-vitamin-d-supplements#what-to-look-for-in-a-vitamin-d-supplement-7) and pored over labels, studies, and customer reviews to determine which are best.

Best for babies: Nordic Naturals Baby's Vitamin D3 - [See at Amazon](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biauto-57857-20&h=622cb46d41733a364499e39670c7c3b24f5e0d0b12473c9b2d5eba9f7b1cd5fd&postID=63504b0f71518a128716d813&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Fdiet-nutrition%2Fbest-vitamin-d-supplements&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNordic-Naturals-Babys-Vitamin-Cholecalciferol%2Fdp%2FB00U1V8HO4&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) Nordic Naturals Vitamin D3 inexpensive third-party verified. Pros: Third-party tested, vegan, non-GMO, affordable Cons: More expensive on Amazon HUM Nutrition's Here Comes The Sun vitamin D supplements took the top spot because they're rigorously tested, suitable for folks with various dietary restrictions, and reasonably priced. Not only are the softgels free from gelatin but the vitamin D3 comes from a vegan source rather than the animal sources, like lanolin, more commonly used in D3 supplements. They contain 2000 IU of vitamin D3. Users online like that the softgels are small and easy to swallow \u2014 and because they're potent, you'll likely only need to take one per day, depending on what your doctor recommends. Discerning shoppers will appreciate that the supplements are non-GMO and that HUM takes sustainability into account with its sourcing. I like the fact that HUM's supplements are also independently tested and verified for potency, and that it uses packaging that's fully recyclable as-is, so there's no need to throw out the cap or scrub off the label. Currently, a 30-day supply of Here Comes The Sun goes for $18 on Amazon or $12 if you buy directly from the HUM website or at certain other retailers, like Sephora. Amazon devotees might find that annoying but it's a significant enough price difference that savvy shoppers ought to know. Pros: USP-verified, low price, easy to swallow Cons: Contains gelatin If you're looking to save money, Nature Made offers some of the best supplements on the market at a competitively low price point. Its softgels containing 2000 IU of vitamin D3 currently cost less than $6 for a 90-day supply and have earned USP verification \u2014 a third-party certification that attests to the product's quality in terms of manufacturing and ingredients. Plus, a suggested daily dose is just one capsule (depending on your vitamin D levels), so it's not too much of a burden for those who hate gulping down pills (and customer [reviews](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biauto-57857-20&h=fa8b86453fb6b356790a50130403dea0606e350c71577329d504e49b9a720a40&postID=63504b0f71518a128716d813&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Fdiet-nutrition%2Fbest-vitamin-d-supplements&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNature-Made-Vitamin-2000-Softgels%2Fdp%2FB002QO00YO&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) say the capsules are small and easy to swallow, anyways). These softgels do contain gelatin, so they're not suitable for vegans, vegetarians, or those who avoid pork for religious reasons. Nature Made does, however, sell vitamin D in tablet form, which is vegetarian-friendly (although still not vegan) and still USP-verified. Nature Made also offers vitamin D in other dosages, ranging from 400 to 5,000 IU, so there are options for folks with varying degrees of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Be sure to check with your doctor to find out what dosage is right for you. Pros: Vegan, affordable, organic and non-GMO Cons: Some users dislike the taste If you prefer to take your vitamins in liquid form whenever possible, this spray by Garden of Life is the top choice for you. It has over 3,700 5-star reviews on Amazon and each bottle contains roughly 125, 1,000 IU servings, and it only costs $17. While vitamin D3 is usually derived from lanolin, a wax found in sheep's wool, this supplement sources its D3 from lichen, a composite organism associated with algae, making it suitable for not just vegetarians but vegans as well. As a plus, this spray also contains a blend of plant-based omega-3, 6, 7, and 9 fatty acids, which can be difficult to source on a vegan diet. Many reviewers say they like the vanilla flavor (though of course, not all), and it can be either sprayed directly into the mouth or mixed into a beverage of your choice. A single spray contains 1,000 IU of vitamin D3 and you can always move up to two or three sprays daily if your doctor recommends. While this vitamin spray doesn't have an official verification seal from USP or NSF, Garden of Life's products are manufactured according to the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices and undergo third-party [testing](https://www.gardenoflife.com/testing) that meets USP standards. Pros: Simple, holistic, vegan, USP-verified, convenient subscription plan Cons: Pricey Personalized, all-inclusive subscription services seem to be all the rage right now when it comes to personal care products, vitamins included. I like that Ritual's offerings are simple: rather than pick and choose from a bunch of individual supplements, it offers a selection of multivitamins formulated for different ages and sexes, as well as prenatal and postnatal formulations. All of its adult multivitamins contain 2000 IU of vitamin D3 along with a blend of other vitamins and minerals targeted to the common health needs of each demographic. I also appreciate Ritual's commitment to third-party testing and quality control, which goes above and beyond many of its competitors. Its ingredients are also transparently sourced (you can find on its website where specifically each component comes from), and its packaging is made from recycled materials. At $30-35 a month, Ritual certainly isn't the cheapest option out there (or on this list). But considering that it's a multivitamin, you're getting a pretty decent value for that price, especially if you'd otherwise be buying several individual supplements. Pros: NSF-certified facilities, easy to use, non-GMO, infant-appropriate dose Cons: Slow dropper It's not uncommon for pediatricians to recommend [vitamin D supplementation for infants](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/vitamin-d-for-babies/faq-20058161#:~:text=Babies%20need%20vitamin%20D%20to,to%20prevent%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency.), since breast milk alone may not provide enough of the necessary vitamin (though this depends on the mother's vitamin D status and [if she's supplementing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK500914/)). And, unlike older children and adults, direct sun exposure isn't recommended for babies. Sufficient vitamin D intake can help support a baby's healthy bone development and prevent rickets, and may support immunity and promote healthy sleep rhythms as well. These drops contain 400 IU of vitamin D3 each, which meets the American Academy of Pediatrics [recommendation](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/0715/p196.html#:~:text=The%20American%20Academy%20of%20Pediatrics,infants%2C%20children%2C%20and%20adolescents.) for breastfed infants. Several reviewers do mention that the bottle's dropper is very slow, which may be inconvenient when you have a crying baby on your hands. But if dropping the supplement liquid directly into your baby's mouth is too tricky, it can also be mixed into a bottle of pre-pumped breastmilk or applied directly to the nursing parent's nipple. Some of Nordic Naturals products are made in NSF-certified facilities and are non-GMO certified, and the only other ingredient besides vitamin D3 in this liquid supplement is organic extra virgin olive oil. This product is recommended for an infant's first year of life and contains about a year's worth of doses, so you'll only need to make the purchase - which costs $14 via Amazon - once. A trip to the vitamin store or a quick Google search yields many options for vitamin D supplements in all forms \u2014 liquid, capsule, gummy, chewable, you name it. Here are more of my findings about some other popular vitamin D supplements out there. The medical experts I talked to for this guide were clear about one thing: the human body is better able to absorb vitamin D3 than D2. So it's ideal to go for a D3 supplement. (You can read more about the difference between D2 and D3 in the FAQ section below.) Monte Swarup, MD, and board-certified OB/GYN noted a few other things to look for in a vitamin D supplement. The first of which is a safe dosage: \"The Institute of Medicine has placed the recommended dietary allowance, or RDA, for vitamin D at 600 international units (IU) per day for young adults and 800 IU per day for adults older than 70.\" However, those who suffer from vitamin D deficiency may be directed to take much [higher doses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532266/), generally 1,000-2,000 IU and as much as 6,000 for some folks. Before buying, check with your doctor to find out what dosage is most appropriate for you. Additionally, Swarup encouraged consumers to seek out supplements that adhere to [CGMPs](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/facts-about-current-good-manufacturing-practices-cgmps) (Current Good Manufacturing Practices) and FDA standards, and are certified by a third party for safety and quality. It's important to note that, unlike drugs, supplements [do not need FDA approval](https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplements/information-consumers-using-dietary-supplements) before hitting shelves (though the agency can remove supplements that have been found to be unsafe), so consumers rely on third-party organizations like [USP](https://www.usp.org/), [NSF](https://www.nsf.org/), or [Consumer Lab](https://www.consumerlab.com/about/) to ensure that a supplement actually contains the ingredients and dosage listed on the label. Vitamin D deficiency can be caused by diet, lack of sunlight, certain medical conditions, aging, and even some physical traits like obesity or dark-toned skin. The best way to find out if you need to supplement with vitamin D is by taking a blood test. Specifically, your doctor should administer a 25-hydroxy vitamin D test, which you can ask for at your annual physical if your physician isn't performing it already. This test can determine if your vitamin D levels are normal, insufficient, or deficient. \"If it's normal, you shouldn't need a supplement, and especially not in the summer where we get more than enough sunshine to produce some in our bodies,\" said Dana Ellis Hunnes, PhD, RD, MPH, and a senior clinical dietician at UCLA Medical Center. \"Generally speaking, only individuals who are vitamin D deficient or insufficient ought to be taking vitamin D supplements. It's not necessary to take vitamin D supplements if you have a normal level, and if you take too much, it could do more harm than good.\" According to the [National Institutes of Health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31076739/), about 5% of Americans are at risk of being truly deficient in vitamin D, and another 18% are at risk of having inadequate levels of vitamin D. As Dahany mentioned earlier, it's rare for the average person to be truly deficient in vitamin D, but it's much more common to have levels that are \"suboptimal\" and could benefit from supplementation. But don't just guess - ask your doctor to help you find out for sure if vitamin D supplements are a good idea for you. There are two different forms of vitamin D that supplements come in: vitamin D2, called ergocalciferol, and vitamin D3, called cholecalciferol. Both D2 and D3 are converted into 25 hydroxyvitamin D in your body but your body more effectively converts D3. This means you'll get more usable/bioactive vitamin D from a D3 supplement than from a D2. Studies also show that D3 supplements are [more effective](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22552031/) than D2 at raising a person's vitamin D levels. Dahany added that this is because the D3 form is more bioavailable, meaning more of it is able to actually be absorbed by your system. Plus, D2 is more sensitive to humidity and temperature changes, so these kinds of supplements degrade faster than a D3 supplement. Vitamin D3 is most commonly derived from animal sources and vitamin D2 from plants. However, there are vegan and vegetarian sources of D3, such as algae oil. If you're a vegan or vegetarian, or have certain food allergies, check the labels to be sure you've chosen a supplement that's suitable for you. In short, yes - vitamin D toxicity is a risk, albeit an [uncommon](https://accpjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/phar.1037) one. There are ultimately three ways your body can take in vitamin D: diet, supplements, and the vitamin D your skin produces when exposed to the sun. You're unlikely to get too much vitamin D from diet (there just aren't many food sources of vitamin D) and sunlight alone, because your body has mechanisms for balancing things out. \"Your body is an excellent vitamin regulator so it's pretty hard to overdose on vitamin D from foods,\" Danahy said. \"Adults would need to eat about 4 ounces of salmon or 14 eggs every day to even slightly exceed the recommended amount (600 IU/day) from foods.\" You also can't get too much vitamin D from sun exposure - your body will simply produce less of it if you're taking in enough from other sources. So, supplementation is the most likely way you could take in more vitamin D than your body can use. Excessive supplementation can cause vitamin D toxicity, which can lead to a buildup of calcium in your blood, called hypercalcemia. According to Dr. Swarup, symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include frequent urination, nausea, weakness, and vomiting. If allowed to progress, vitamin D toxicity can cause bone pain, kidney problems, and calcium stones. For this reason, medical professionals advise having your vitamin D levels checked by a blood test before you start taking supplements to see if you are deficient or insufficient. If your vitamin D levels are already normal, no need to supplement - it could potentially cause more harm than good. Vitamin D helps the body absorb and hold on to [phosphorus and calcium](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-d/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20fat%2Dsoluble,control%20infections%20and%20reduce%20inflammation.), both of which are critical for bone health. Studies have suggested that vitamin D supplementation may help older adults prevent bone fractures, especially when taken along with calcium. There is some evidence that vitamin D may also help reduce the risk of [heart disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25526571/) and [type 2 diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27932304/), and support overall [immune](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23857223/) function, although these findings are much more preliminary and the medical community has yet to reach any kind of consensus about these potential effects.
