In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in the world population who uses complementary or alternative medicine. The increase in the knowledge of metabolic processes has led to molecular studies elucidating the molecular mechanisms of herbal medicines and pharmacological networks to predict the synergistic effect of the multiple components of herbal drugs. Interestingly, the demands of the market for medicinal herbs are likely to remain high because many natural products or phytoconstituents in medicinal plants cannot yet be synthesized. Most herbal preparations are free from adverse effects. Herbal medicine provides a rational treatment of many disease or conditions which are difficult to treat or incurable in other types of treatment, such as allopathic medicine. This topic of the Special Issue is focused on gathering original research on herbal drugs and natural products, including phytochemical studies, in silico network pharmacology and molecular docking studies, in vitro assays, including the use of cell lines, and in vivo preclinical toxicological and pharmacological studies, along with molecular studies of plant extracts and natural products. Reviews on herbal medicine and natural product research are also within the scope of this special issue.
