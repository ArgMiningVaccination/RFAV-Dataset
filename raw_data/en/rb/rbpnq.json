Abstract Violence against nurses is a comple x and persistent occupational haza rd facing the nursing profession. Paradoxically, the job sector with th e mission to care for people appears to be at the highest risk of workplace violence. Nurses are among the most assa ulted workers in the American workforce. Too frequently, nurses are exposed to violence - primarily from patients, patients' families, and visitors. This violence can take the form of intimidation, harassment, stalking, beatings, stabbings, shootings, and other forms of assault. Psychological consequences resulting from violence may include fear, frustration, lack of trust in hospital administration, and decreased job satisfaction. Incidences of violence early in nurses' careers are particularly problematic as nurses can become disillusioned with their profession. Violence not only affects nurses' perspectives of the profession, but it also undermines recr uitment and retention efforts which, in a time of a pervasive nursing shortage, thre atens patient care. The purpose of this report is to highlight the recommendations of the National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice (NACNEP) with regard to this issue. In de veloping this report, the NACNEP conducted a review and assessment of the pr oblem of violence agains t nurses. Analysis presented within this report is based on presen tations by subject-matter experts, discussions, and workgroup sessions held by the NACNEP members. The NACNEP also conducted a comprehensive review of the literature in the area of violence in the nursing profession. Finally, the NACNEP developed recommendations integrating the analysis and literature review. The recommendations contained herein address regulator y issues, educational programs, nursing practice interventions, and data collection and dissemination issues as they re late to the problem of violence against nurses. Executive Summary The FY 2005 Annual Report of the National Advi sory Council on Nurse Education and Practice (NACNEP) is based on the April 200 5 meeting held in Rockville, Ma ryland. Three key topics were discussed at the meeting which incl uded violence against nurses, the nurse critical s hortage facility study, and nursing workforce diversity program exemplars. The primary focus of the meeting was the impact of violence against nurses. During the meeting, the NACNEP assessed th e causes of violence against nurses; reviewed its impact on recruitment, retention, and pr evention; considered intervention strategies; and developed recommendations. The NAC NEP also learned about a study defining health care facilities with a critical shortage of nurses. The outcome of this study will be used in the administration of the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program and the Nurse Scholarship Program. Finally, four grantees from the Nursing Workforce Diversity Program presented their work to the NACNEP. These grantees de scribed successful strategies to recruit minority and disadvantaged individuals into nursing. 1.

Violence Against Nurses Violence against nurses is a comple x and persistent occupational haza rd facing the nursing profession. Paradoxically, the job sector with th e mission to care for people appears to be at the highest risk of workplace violence. Nurses are among the most assa ulted workers in the American workforce. Too frequently, nurses are exposed to violence - primarily from patients, patients' families, and visitors. This violence can take the form of intimidation, harassment, stalking, beatings, stabbing, shootings, and other forms of assault. Psychological consequences resulting from violence may include fear, frustration, lack of trust in hospital administration, and decreased job satisfaction. Incidences of violence early in nurses' careers are particularly problematic as nurses can become disillusioned with their profession. Violence not only affects nurses' perspectives of the profession, but it also undermines recr uitment and retention efforts which, in a time of a pervasive nursing shortage, thre atens patient care. The purpose of this report is to highlight the recommendations of th e NACNEP with regard to this issue. In developing this report, the NACNEP c onducted a review and assessm ent of the problem of violence against nurses. Analysis presented within this report is based on presentations by subject- matter experts, discussions, and workgroup sess ions held by the NACNEP members. The NACNEP also conducted a comprehensive review of the lit erature in the area of violence in the nursing profession. Finally, the NACNEP deve loped recommendations integratin g the analysis and literature review. Overview of the Problem There is considerable evidence that workers in the hea lth care sector are at greater risk of violence than workers in any other sector. The U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that 48 percent of all non-fatal inju ries from occupational assaults and violent acts occurred in health care and social services settings (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2001). The BLS data also showed that while two in 10,000 employ ees overall in the private sector suffer injuries annually that require time off from work, rates of injuries are signifi cantly greater for health care employees. Annually, 9.3 in 10,000 employees in the hea lth services sector suffe r injuries that require time off from work. In nursing and personal car e facilities, 25 in 10,000 employees suffer such injuries - more than 10 times the overall private sector rate. This data is depi cted in the chart below. 2 Non-Fatal Incidences* per 10,000 Workers 29.31525 051015202530 Private Sector Overall Health Services Social Services Nursing & Personal Care Facilities * Incidence is defined as assault resulting in injury that requires time off from work Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (2001). Nurses are the most likely of all health care providers to be assaulted. The U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics (B JS), National Crime Victimizati on Survey 1993-1999 showed that the health care sector led all other se ctors in the incidence of non-fatal workplace assaults and that nurses were the most likely of health care workers to be assaulted (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2001). Assa ult rates are particularly high among Emergency Department (ED) nurses (Roll, 2005). A study of 125 nurses at a regional medical center found that 82 percent of ED nurses had been physically assau lted at work during 2001 (May & Grubbs, 2002). As sobering as these numbers are, they are likely understated. In anothe r survey only two-thirds of physical violence incidents against registered nurses (RNs) were reported (Gerberich et al., 2004). The nursing profession faces unique challenges in addressing violence and its impact on the nursing workforce. These challenges result from factors su ch as poor working conditions, exposure to violent individuals, and a view that when violence does occur, it is part of the job. These factors, combined with fiscal constraints, organi zational realities, inadequate ad ministrative support, and lack of legislation to protect nurses, re sult in significant barriers to over coming the problem of violence against nurses. Moreover, the recruitment and retention problem resul ting from this violence is especially problematic in light of the current nurse shor tage. According to projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than one million new and replace ment RNs will be needed by 2012 (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2004). Thirty st ates were estimated to have RN shortages as of 2000 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2002). This shortage is projected to accelerate over the next two decades, with 44 states plus the District of Columbia expected to have RN shortages by the year 2020 (U.S. Department of Health an d Human Services, 2002). A nationwide hospital survey reported 126,000 RN vacancies (American Hosp ital Association, 2001). Currently in long-term care facilities, 15 percent of staff nur se (RN) positions are vacant. This shortage is jeopardizing access to high-quality patient care ac ross the United States (American Health Care Association, 2004). 3 Over the years, there have been efforts to addr ess the crisis of violence against nurses through educational and training curricula , violence prevention and intervention programs, and attempts to change a culture that tolerates viol ence. However, few such activitie s have been ade quately evaluated for their effectiveness or implemented on a wide-scale basis. Literature Review In an effort to provide a background and c ontext for this report , the NACNEP conducted a comprehensive literature review focusing on violence affecting nurses in the workforce. Included in the search were the published lite rature, unpublished policy statements , and guidelines and regulations from various agencies and organizations. Major topics explored in the literature included statistics on incidents of violence in the nurse workplace, risk factors, sources of data on violence against nurses, definitions of workplace violence, legislation, the im pact of violence on nursing careers, and violence prevention and intervention programs. Conclusion and Recommendations Violence in the workplace is ta king a significant toll on the nurs ing profession. Violence, both physical and psychological, has affected nurses' attitudes toward the nursing profession and recruitment and retention efforts. To address these challenges, the NACNEP is putting forward a set of recommendations in four areas: regulatory, educational programs; nursing pract ice interventions, and data collection and dissemination. Through the following recommendations, the NACNEP believes progress can be made in addressing these challenges facing the profession. Regulatory Develop and adopt a standard definition of wo rkplace violence; strengthen and adopt regulatory and/or accrediting agency (e.g., Occupationa l Safety and Health Administration) recommendations on workplace violence in heal th care settings including institutional, community, and academic settings, as a requirement for workplace safety. Educational Programs Target faculty development initiatives on vi olence in nursing focu sing on prevention, early intervention, legal and ethical issues, and acces s to resources and referral systems in both educational and clinical environments. Target funding to support basic a nd continuing education initiativ es focused on evidence-based core competencies (knowledge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors) related to workplace violence and violent behaviors. Improve basic and continuing education programs for nursing personnel, including faculty, staff, and students, on self-protection in viol ent situations and competency in violence prevention and management. Nursing Practice Interventions Transition the health care culture into one in whic h a secure work environment for nurses and other health care workers is a priority: Establish clear standards for workplace safety supported by resources for the management of violence. 4 Eliminate institutional barriers for a safe wo rk environment by supporting a culture of open communication and reporting among nursing staff, faculty, health care personnel, and students regarding violence in the workplace. Offer violence prevention and manage ment training in the workplace. Keep violence and security issues on the radar screen of risk managers in health care facilities. Provide clearly defined support re sources, such as legal and psyc hological services, to nurses in violent situations, or at risk of facing violent situations. Include violence prevention and management in the criteria for the American Nurses Credentialing Center Ma gnet Recognition Program. Support demonstration projects for implementation of best practice models in violence prevention and management in health care settings. Disseminate information on model violence prev ention programs and best practices including programs appropriate for smaller/rural health care facilities. Disseminate information on available resources and best-practices for violence prevention and management protocols in health care settings. Develop guidelines for conducting employee and student background checks on violent behavior. Data Collection and Dissemination Collate and analyze data on workplace violen ce from government agencies (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Occupationa l Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Justice), health care facilities, community-based settings, and in nursing education to: \u0083 Assess the scope and incidence of workplace violence in Federally funded agencies and track the changes in rates of violence due to policy and procedure interventions; \u0083 Assess the impact of workplace violence on nurse recruitment and retention; \u0083 Assess management, documentation, and response to violence in the workplace; and \u0083 Disseminate information to health care settin gs in support of increased violence prevention and management programs. Incorporate into the 2008 Nationa l Sample Survey of Registered Nurses questions on violence in the workplace including the t ypes of violence experienced, form al documentation of violence, and the effect of violence on job satisfaction and retention. Provide resources for research on violence against nurses to determine effective prevention, intervention, and management strategies. 2. Nurse Critical Shortage Facility Study The Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program and the Nurse Scholarship Program are programs in which participants provide nursing serv ice in health care facilities with a critical shortage of nurses as stipulated in the Title VIII legislation. Shortages of nurses are seen across the Nation in all types of health care settings. Council members were briefe d on a two-year study at the Center for Health 5 Workforce Studies, State University of New York (SUNY), Albany, to identify the essential components of a comprehensive, national methodol ogy for identifying facilitie s and agencies with critical shortages of registered nurses. 3. Nursing Workforce Diversity Exemplars In response to the NACNEP's duties and requests for ongoing information on Title VIII programs and diversity programs in particular, a panel of four Nursing Workforce Diversity Program Exemplars was convened to share successes and ac complishments of their programs to increase nursing education opportunities for individuals from disa dvantaged and minority backgrounds. 6 1. Violence Against Nurses Introduction Prevention and Intervention Programs and Strategies Status of Research on Violence Against Nurses Recommendations References 7 1. Violence Against Nurses 1.1. Introduction Violence against nurses is a comple x and persistent occupational haza rd facing the nursing profession. This violence can take the form of intimidation, harassment, stalking, beatings, stabbings, shootings, and other forms of assault. Nurses are among the mo st assaulted workers in the American workforce. Psychological consequences resulting from violence may include fear, anxiety, sadness, depression, frustration, mistrust, and nervousness. These co nsequences can have a negative impact on nurse retention. To evaluate the problem of violen ce against nurses and its impact, a nd to develop recommendations to address the problem, the National Advisory Coun cil on Nurse Education and Practice (NACNEP) conducted a thorough literature review in 2005 focused on the problem of violence affecting the nursing workforce. Included in the review were published literature, unpublis hed policy statements, and guidelines and regulations from various agencies and organizations. The major topics explored were the nature of violence in the nursing workpl ace (including statistics, risk factors, violence directed against nurses, inter-staff violence, and violence directed at patients by nurses); violence in the nursing education environment; viol ence experienced by nurses outside of the workplace; and violence toward patients that is detected, reported, and addressed by nurses. The purpose of this report is to highlight the NACNEP's review of the problem of violence against nurses and put forward recommendations to address the problem. 1.1.1. Overview of the Problem \"Workplace violence is one of the most comple x and dangerous occupational hazards facing nurses working in today's health care environmen t. The complexities arise, in part, from a health care culture resistant to the notion that health care providers are at risk for patient- related violence combined with complacency that violence (if it exists) 'is part of the job.' The dangers arise from the exposure to violen t individuals combined with the absence of strong violence prevention programs and protecti ve regulations. Thes e factors together with organizational realities such as staff s hortages and increased patient acuity create substantial barriers to eliminating violen ce in today's health care workplace.\" (McPhaul & Lipscomb, 2004) The media has provided extensive coverage of wor kplace murders by disgruntled former or current employees in the general workforce. Those events, while certainly serious, are relatively rare. Far more common are assaults, threats, stalkings, and other forms of non-fata l violence in the workplace. Violence targeted at health care wo rkers is of particular concern, as these workers are among the most likely in the workplace to be assaulted. Incidences of violence early in nurses' careers are pa rticularly problematic as they may lead nurses to become disillusioned with their profession. Nurses often feel powerless to deal with a situation in which they have been victimized and, as a result , accept violence as part of the job. Homeyer (2005) found nurses are often reprimanded or fired if they defend themselves against violence. 8 As job satisfaction decreases as a result of violence, the likelihood of nurses leaving their employment increases with nurses finding different roles within the health care setting or leaving the profession entirely (Shader, Broome, Broome, West, & Nash, 2001) . The lack of support from administrators in addressing problems of violence in the workplace is a contributor to burnout and resignations of even the most seasoned veteran nurses. This is an issue that the profession and h ealth care industry cannot continue to ignore especially in light of the current nursing shortage. Statistics on Violence against Nurses There is considerable evidence that workers in the hea lth care sector are at greater risk of violence than workers in any other sector. The U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that 48 percent of all non-fatal inju ries from occupational assaults and violent acts occurred in health care and social services settings (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2001). The BLS data also showed that while two in 10,000 employ ees overall in the private sector suffer injuries annually that require time off from work, rates of injuries are si gnificantly greater for health care employees. Annually, 9.3 in 10,000 employees in the hea lth services sector suffe r injuries that require time off from work. In nursing and personal car e facilities, 25 in 10,000 employees suffer such injuries - more than 10 times the overall private sector rate. This data is depi cted in the chart below. Non-Fatal Incidences* per 10,000 Workers 29.31525 051015202530 Private Sector Overall Health Services Social Services Nursing & Personal Care Facilities * Incidence is defined as assault resulting in injury that requires time off from work Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (2001). Nurses are especially at risk as they are the most li kely of all health care provi ders to be assaulted. The U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey 1993-1999 showed that the health care sector led all ot her industry sectors in the incidence of non-fatal workplace assaults and that nurses are the most like ly of health care workers to be assaulted (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2001). Accordi ng to the Department of Justice data, nurses are 57 percent more likely to be a ssaulted than are physicia ns. Assault rates are particularly high among emergency department (ED) nurses (Roll, 2005). In a recent survey of 125 ED nurses, intensive care unit and general floor nurse s at a regional medical cen ter, 82 percent of ED nurses had been physically assaulted at work during 2001 (May & Grubbs, 2002). 9 Underreporting of Statistics As sobering as these numbers are, they are likely understated. Nurses are reluctant to report violence that is committed against them in the workplace. One study involving nearly 8,800 nurses in 210 hospitals revealed that 70 percen t of the nurses experiencing abuse ha d not reported that mistreatment (Duncan & Hyndman, 2001). A survey of more th an 4,700 Minnesota nurses revealed that only 69 percent of physical violence incidents were reported (Gerberich et al., 2004). In a study by Findorff, McGovern, Wall, and Gerberich (2005), of the 923 respondents who experienced aggression from physicians, 43 percent did not report the incident to their employer. Of those who experienced other non-physical violence at work, 60 percent did not re port these events. In this same study, when violence incidents were re ported, 86 percent of the re ports were oral (rather than written reports). These findings suggest that violen ce incidents are significantly underrepo rted and that those incidents that are reported may be under managed. The causes for underreporting are numerous. Many nurse s believe that being a ssaulted may be viewed as poor performance on their part, or that assaults ar e just part of the job. In a survey of emergency room nurses, more than half agreed with the statement, \"Nurses who take legal action against a patient are in jeopardy of losing their jobs .\" In addition, 76 percent stated that their decision would be based on whether the patient was perceived as being re sponsible for their action (Erickson & Williams- Evans, 2000). When nurses are assaulted in the workpl ace, they typically feel compelled to consider a variety of factors before taking le gal action against the assaulting pa tient. This may involve some accommodation because the nurses believe that assailan ts (e.g., psychotic patients, distraught family members) may not know what they are doing. Eriks on and Williams-Evans (2000) asserted that most nurses believe violence and assaul t are part of the job, and they presented evidence suggesting workplace violence has a normative effect, meani ng that over time, frequent violent acts and aggression gradually become accepted as part of the workplace culture. \"Nurses also suffer from societal tolerance of violence. The legal system has on several occasions refused to grant compensation to nurse victims. This was justified on the principle that to practise nursing was to accept the risk of personal violence. Nurses themselves often feel that they are 'legitimate targets' and that violence is 'part of the job'. (Internati onal Council of Nurses, n.d.) In addition, nurses are often confused about what legally constitutes a buse or assault, and policies and procedures for reporting violent events are not clear (May & Grubbs, 2002). The literature overwhelmingly suggests th at nurses generally feel unsupported by management in relation to workplace violence, and this could well influence a nurse's decision not to report unacceptable behavior (Jackson, Claire, & Mannix, 2002). There is a belief that hospital administration may want to avoid the publicity that could accompany pressing charges against a patient (Homeyer, 2005). This may discourage nurses from taking legal action, because they perceive management will not support them. The NACNEP recommends eliminating institutiona l barriers for a safe work environment by supporting a culture of open commu nication and reporting among nursing staff, faculty, health care personnel, and students regarding violence in the workplace. Furthermore, the NACNEP recommends providing clearly defined support re sources such as legal and psyc hological services to nurses in violent situations or at risk of facing violent situations. 10 1.1.2. Types of Violence Affe cting the Nursing Workforce Violence that affects the nursing workforce comes in many forms. The most common form is violence committed by patients in the workplace. However, violence affecting nurses is also seen in the educational setting and ou tside the workplace. Violence in the Workplace Forty-five percent of violence committed against nurses in health care facilities is inflicted by patients. Nearly one-third of violent acts against nurses are committed by family members of patients, visitors, and health care providers, including physicians (Homeyer, 2005). T ypically, the assailants are males who are impaired (Gerberich et al., 2004). The mo st common causes of assault by family members of patients are anger related to staff enforcement of hos pital policies, the patient 's situation or condition, long wait-times, or the health care system in gene ral (May & Grubbs, 2002). Th is type of violence is most common in nursing homes, long-term care facili ties, intensive care units, emergency departments, and psychiatric departments. \"Ninety-five percent of nur ses around the world are women. Attitudes towards women are often reflected in interactions with the profession. ...Health care workers are more likely to be attacked at work than prison guard s or police officers. Nurses are the health care workers most at risk, with female nurse s considered the most vulnerable. General patient rooms have replaced psychiatric un its as the second most frequent area for assaults. Physical assault is almost exclusiv ely perpetrated by patients. 97 percent of nurse respondents to a UK survey knew a nurse who had been physically assaulted during the past year. 72 percent of nurse s don't feel safe from assault in their workplace. Up to 95 percent of nurses reported having been bullied at work. Up to 75 percent of nurses reported having been s ubjected to sexual harassment at work.\" (International Council of Nurses, n.d.) While patients are the most freque nt source of sexual harassment a nd physical assault against nurses, over half of the sexual assaults are committed by physicians (Williams, 1996). Physicians are also a frequent source of verbal abuse (Sofield & Salm ond, 2003). In a survey of 1,000 nurses at a large hospital system, 91 percent of resp ondents had experienced verbal a buse in the prior month and the most frequent aggressor was a physician (Sofie ld & Salmond, 2003). Fare ll (1999) and McMillan (1995) also found that nurse managers often used aggression toward staff nurses. Violence in health care facilities is fostered by a complex set of institutional and social forces that work to aggravate the problem. Cost pressures: Cost pressures make it difficult to train staff to deal with violence in the workplace. Not only is the cost of training expensive, but when combined with paying the salaries of other staff to cover for those in training, the overall co sts can be prohibitive (Roll, 2005). Staffing shortages : Staffing shortages have resulted in lowe r standards for hiring (Bradley & Moore, 2004). Under pressure to fill vacant positions, given the nursing shortage, facilities may take shortcuts in the hiring process or adhere to lower standard s for staff hired. Nurses and other employees who have not been subjected to effective internal screening practices, includi ng a review of prior employment records, criminal convi ctions, or driving records, put th e institution at risk (Bradley & Moore, 2004). Characteristics of patients : Acute care settings are under increasing financ ial pressures including those from growing numbers of uninsured patients, and this, combined with staffing shortages, can 11 result in longer patient wait-times and inadequate security - both risk factor s that can contribute to violence (McPhaul & Lipscomb, 2004). Family violen ce is also pervasive, and nurses often encounter violent family situations that make their way into health care sett ings (Gerberich et al., 2005). Furthermore, many of the patients at risk for perp etrating acts of violence are cognitively impaired at the time they enter the nursing workplace or distressed by their health problems, increasing the likelihood of their committing aggressive acts. Poor or stressful working conditions : Substandard conditions in workplace environments, characterized by poor comm unication and under resourced faciliti es, lead to tensions that can contribute to aggression (Duxbury & Whittington, 2005). A dditional risk factors leading to violence in the workplace include working in intensive care, me ntal health, and emergency departments (Findorff, McGovern, Wall, Gerberich, & Alexa nder, 2004), most likely because of the high stress in these work sites. Attitudes among management, nurses, and students: As described previously, an accepting attitude toward violence in the workplace is commonplace (Beech, 2001). Often, customer service initiatives (e.g., minimizing the physical barrie rs between caregivers and patie nts, encouraging nurses to \"be nice\" to customers) take priority over facilities' focus on keeping the staff safe from aggressive patients (Homeyer, 2005). The NACNEP recommends offering violence prevention and management training in the workplace and keeping violence and security issues on the radar screen of risk managers in he alth care facilities. Violence in the Nursing Educat ion and Training Environment Academic environments are also vulnerable to vi olence. Love and Morrison (2003) noted studies documenting increased verbal threats, harassment, intimidation, and stalking of nursing faculty by students who are experiencing acad emic problems or facing termination from the program. Many schools have instituted criminal background check po licies for students and faculty in efforts to address this problem (Burns, Frank-Stromborg, Te ytelman, & Herren, 2004). Tate and Moody (2005) discussed extending authority to conduct criminal background checks for nurses. They also proposed conducting checks for students upon en try to clinical nursing course s and as a pre-requisite for graduation and application for licensure. Typicall y, applicants are required to pay for criminal background checks (National Council of State Boards of Nursi ng, 2005). The NACNEP recommends developing guidelines for conducting employee a nd student background checks on violent behavior. 1.1.3. Impact of Violence on Recruitment and Retention Violence in the health care workplace is of particular concern given the importance of retention in the nursing profession. It is st rongly correlated to factor s in job dissatisfaction su ch as powerlessness and low morale (Jackson et al., 2002). This feeling of lack of empowerment among nurses, due directly to violence in the workplace, has often been correlated with sick leave, burnout , and poor recruitment and retention rates (Jack son et al., 2002). Workplace aggression is the most anxiety-provoking aspect of nursing work for a significant number of nurses, and the high levels of workplace violence experienced by nurses may be a factor in the loss of experienced staff (Sourdiff, 2004). It is often \"t he straw that breaks the camel's back\" that causes nurses, who often feel overworked and inadequately protected agai nst workplace violence, to leave their jobs (McPhaul & Lipscomb, 2004). 12 Effects of Non-Physical Abuse on Retention One of the least-reported forms of violence is non-physical, though it may be more prevalent than physical violence in affecting the retention of nurses (Findorff, Mc Govern, & Sinclair, 2005). In a survey of 1,000 nurses, Sofield a nd Salmond (2003) found that more than half of the respondents did not feel competent in responding to verbal abuse while 91 percent had experienced verbal abuse in the past month. They also found that non-physical vi olence left the recipient feeling personally or professionally attacked, devalued, or humiliated. Verbal abuse significantly impacts the workplace by decreasing morale and job satisfaction, and creating a hostile work climate (Sofield & Salmond, 2003). Communication between nurses and physicians is one ar ea where studies show verbal abuse may have a significantly disruptive impact on a nurse's intention to stay at a job. Rosenstein (2002) found that 30 percent of surveyed nurses knew of nurses who had left an organization because of disruptive communication and verbal abuse by physicians. Sofield and Salmond (2003) found that physicians were the most frequent source of verbal abuse, followed by patients, patients' families, peers, supervisors, and subordinates. They found that the amount of abuse a nd intent-to-leave were significantly related. The authors found that 12 percent of the nur ses surveyed planned to actively look for a new job within the next year and 22 percent would consider resigning as a result of verbal abuse. Effects of Physical Violence on Nursing Retention \"Seventy percent of nurses are assaulted on duty during their careers. And I ask, why would anyone want to be in this profession with these documented statistics? ... After incidents of verbal and physical abuse, nurses often develop characteristics of a victim with feelings of incompetence, guilt, powerlessness, fear of criticism and worthlessness. Instead of seeking care, often nurses just leave the profession or change careers.\" (Homeyer, 2005) Physical abuse is more readily re ported and thus better tracked than non-physical abuse. In a recent survey by the Maryland Nurses Association, 18 percen t of respondents indicated they had left a job because they feared for their safety ; 15 percent of respondents indicated that at some point they wanted to leave but they hadn't yet done so (Distasio, Hall, & Beachley, 2005). A survey of ED employees in an urban inner city tertiary car e center in Vancouver, British Co lumbia, showed that 68 percent reported an increased frequency of violence over time and 60 percent repo rted an increased severity of violence. This included verbal abuse (75 percent) and witnessing physical threats or assaults (86 percent). Over half (57 pe rcent) of respondents were physically assaulted in 1996, with about half reporting impaired job performance for the rest of the shift or week, 73 percent indicating they were afraid of patients after the event, and 74 per cent reporting reduced job satisfaction. In this surve y, of those no longer working in the ED, 67 percent repor ted they had left due to violence (Fernandes et al., 1999). In a survey by Erikson and Williams-Evans (2000), 14 percent of the nurses surveyed had considered transferring out of their department, and 18 percent stated that they had considered leaving the nurs ing profession altogether because of fear of physical abuse. Evidence indicates there is more job turnover associated with stress for younger nurses than with older nurses (Shader et al., 2001). As a result, the impact of violence on retention of younger nurses is perhaps more si gnificant than it is wi th older nurses. Violence can also have an impact on recruitment. It is one of the factors that often make nurses reluctant to recommend nursing as a career choice. Over half (53 percent) of nurses who were surveyed would not recommend the nursing profession as a career choice fo r their children and 23 percent would actively discourage someone close to them from entering the profession (Keough, Schlomer, & Bollenberg, 2003). 13 1.2. Prevention and Interventi on Programs and Strategies A large number of violence preventio n and reduction interventions exist. However, few of these have been evaluated to determine their effectiveness. This section describes prevention and intervention strategies intended to reduce viol ence in the nursing workplace. 1.2.1. Reducing Violence in the Nursing Workplace Education and Training \"Every employee should understand the concept of 'universal precautions for violence' \u2014 that is, that violence should be expected but can be avoided or mitigated through preparation. Frequent training also can reduce the likelihood of being assaulted.\" (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2004, p.19) Educating nursing staff to prevent and respond to workplace violence is a common strategy intended to reduce the incidence and impact of violence. Psychiatric facilitie s in particular experience a high incidence of aggressive behavior and have utilized several different approaches to their management through staff training. In psychiat ric settings, studies have shown that training staff in violence prevention and verbal and physic al de-escalation not only im proves provider knowledge and confidence in handling violent situations, but also reduces injuries (Lehman, Padilla, Clark, & Loucks, 1983; Infantino & Musingo, 1985, as cited in Morris on & Carney-Love, 2003). In an assessment of several commonly used programs for managing aggressive behavior in psychiatric settings, Morrison and Carney-Love (2003) noted that these programs have progressed in recent years from being largely reliant on physical techniques of self-defense to incorpora ting more therapeutic principles. The authors s uggested that this move was positive and consistent with the United Kingdom's 2002 standards for the education of managing aggressive behavior (United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery, and Health Visiting, 2002), but they argued that further evaluation of these programs is needed to determine their effectiveness. Nachreiner, Gerberich, McGovern, Church, Hansen, and Geisser (2005b) attempted to determine if violence prevention training decr eased workplace violence experi enced among Minnesota nurses. While most nurses in the survey (a random sample of the states' RNs and licensed practical nurses [LPNs]) reported receiving some training about wor kplace violence, the study did not find this training to be protective against workplace violence. The study raises questions about why this finding might be occurring. The study could not control for type or quality of the training, nor could it control for the possibility that training leads to a heightened re cognition of violence and increased reporting among trained nurses. More rigorous examination of th e value of training on work -related violence would be useful in this regard. The NACNEP recommends targeting funding to support basic and continuing education initiatives focused on evidence-based core competencies (knowle dge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors) related to workplace violence and violent behaviors. The NACNEP also supports improving basic and continuing education programs for nursing personnel including faculty, staff, and students on self-protection in violent si tuations and competency in viol ence prevention and management. 14 Institutional Policies There is somewhat more evidence that institutiona l policies regarding workplace violence are effective in reducing violence. Zero-toleran ce policies for violence in the wor kplace have been recommended in various arenas such as in the Occupational Safety and Health Administrati on's (OSHA's) \"Guidelines for Preventing Workplace Violence for Health Care and Social Service Workers\" (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2004). OSHA recomme nds employers create a clear policy of zero tolerance for workplace violence, verbal and non-v erbal threats, and related actions (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2004). \"Many of our administrators don't even know that the OSHA guidelines are out there and they are specific for hospitals... The goal of the OSHA program is to eliminate or reduce worker exposure to violence by implementing effective security devices and administrative work practices. Unfortunately, these often just don't hit the radar screen s of most hospitals. Most hospitals do have a security and safety plan, but most address safety [issues] like the fire plan, or patient safety ... Few focus on staff safety, especially from assaultive patients.\" (Homeyer, 2005) A survey of Minnesota nurses found zero-tolerance polic ies in effect in many work sites, and the odds of physical assault decreased among nurses working in locations with these policies (Nachreiner et al., 2005a) . In the same study, various other workplac e violence prevention measures were examined for effectiveness. These included prohibitions of specific behaviors (such as physical assault, threats, sexual harassment, or verbal abuse), assurances of confid entiality in reporting, flagging charts of repeatedly violent patients, delineating consequences for those who were violent at work, requiring violence training for staff, and training in reporting violent incidents. The authors found that the nurses' odds of physical assault decreased only in cases where their work settings had policies that prohibited specific types of violent behaviors. The NACNEP recommends establishing clear standa rds for workplace safety supported by resources for the management of violence. Legislative Interventions Very little legislation has been enac ted specifically to protect nurses. In many states it is not a felony to assault a nurse. In some states, it is a felony to attack a physic ian but a misdemeanor to attack a nurse. A key piece of legislation intended to provide protection for hospital workers is the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which mandates that, in addition to compliance with hazard-specific standards, all employers have a general duty to provide their employees with a workplace free from recognized hazards likely to cau se death or serious physical harm (Homeyer, 2005). OSHA, authorized by the Act, set forth guidelin es to provide a safety and health program that includes violence prevention. Thes e guidelines are advisory only and provide supporting information. They are voluntary and intended to help employers establish effective workplace violence prevention programs. In some cases the employer can be cited for violation of the general du ty clause if it fails to implement certain guidelines (Homeyer, 2005). Thes e guidelines address only the violence inflicted by patients or clients against staff. They do not ex plicitly address violence inflicted by third parties; however, OSHA suggests that workplace violence policie s indicate a zero-toleran ce for all forms of violence from all sources. California provides an example of a legislative intervention to prev ent workplace violence. In 1993, the California Hospital Security Act (AB508) pa ssed which included requirements for acute care 15 facilities to provide safety and s ecurity training to employees, conduct assessments of facility safety and security, develop and implement a security plan, and report to authorities all assault and battery acts within 72 ho urs of occurrence (Peek- Asa, Cubbin, & Hubbell, 2002). Surveys of California's emergency de partments before and after implementation of AB508 found that the hospitals reported fewer violent episodes after its implementation as well as overall improvements in the departments' security programs, but the study could not direct ly attribute these improvements to the legislation (Peek-Asa, Cubbin, & Hubbell, 2002). \"The scientific community, government regulators, health care employers, professional associations, and health care unions should craft a regulation acceptable to all that will reduce the violence endemic in today's health care environment.\" (McPhaul & Lipscomb, 2004) Guidelines Various organizations have prepar ed guidelines and recommendations to prevent and manage violence in the workplace. For example: American Nurses Association (ANA), 2002. Preventing workplace violence. ANA. Washington, DC. International Council of Nurses (ICN), 2000. Posi tion statement: Abuse and violence against nursing personnel. ICN. Geneva, Switzerland. National Institute for Occupational Safety a nd Health (NIOSH), 2002. Violence: Occupational hazards in hospitals. NIOSH Publication num ber 2002-101. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Washington, DC. Occupational Safety and Health Administra tion (OSHA), 2004 (revised). Guidelines for Preventing Workplace Violence for Health Care a nd Social Service Workers. U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Hea lth Administration. Washington, DC. 1.2.2. Strategies for Changing the Health Care Culture The culture of violence pervades the health workplace. This in part reflects the community at large. But despite the calls by researchers and the public a like for a change in the culture that supports or promotes violence in the workplace, there is very little in th e literature that specifies exactly how this culture should or can be changed and whether su ch a strategy would be ef fective. Although this elusive goal has wide support, additional research is needed to de velop and assess strategies that have the potential to change a culture that is so well-rooted and pervasive. Some researchers highlight the importance of advo cacy of nurses and establishment of a zero-tolerance policy to protect nurses (Hende rson, 2003). Others emphasize the impact of environmental factors such as use of coercion and an authoritarian nursi ng style as precursors to patient aggression (Duxbury & Whittington, 2005). Other research points out the need for additional research and the need to better understand the culture of violence in hospita ls (Duncan & Hyndman, 2001; May 1.2.3. Basic and Continuing Educ ation and Training Curricula It is difficult to identify appropr iate violence-related training for nurses, and there is little published evidence of the effectiveness of the training and education programs curre ntly in place. Nonetheless, there is strong sentiment and gene ral agreement among many in the pr ofession that effective basic and continuing education and training in violence identification, preven tion, and treatment are needed. This has been the position of ma ny policy organizations such as the American Nurses Association. Limitations of Violence Training and Education \"According to a recent study, nearly a half million nurses per year reported that they were victims of violent crimes in the workplace. But workplace violence is preventable and should never be accepted as part of the job.\" The lack of evidence of the effectiveness of edu cation and training tools may be a reason why there appears to be limited violence training and educat ion in nursing schools. In a 1999 follow-up to a 1995 national survey of baccalaureate nursing programs in the United States, little change was found in the overall nursing violence-related curriculum; th e majority of schools re ported no violence-related faculty development during the past four years, 68 percent did not sy stematically evaluate violence content, and 75 percent had not developed violen ce-focused student competencies (Woodtli & Breslin, 2002). The NACNEP recommends targeting colle ge and nursing school faculty development initiatives on violence in nursing focusing on prev ention, early intervention, le gal and ethical issues, and access to resources and referral systems in both educational and clinical environments. (American Nurses Association, 2002, p.2) With regard to a workpl ace violence curriculum, more than 40 percent of nurses responding to a survey of Minnesota nurses reported that they were trained in workplace violence (Nachreiner et al., 2005a). But the long-held belief that violence is part of the nursing job, and that it is an inherent nursing occupational hazard, is thought to limit the extent of violence prevention training and education in the nursing workforce (Pieri, 2004). In addition, the incidence of workplace violence prevention and ma nagement training may be low be cause the effectiveness of the training tools that are available is not known (Nachreiner et al., 2005b). 17 1.3. Status of Research on Violence Against Nurses This section describes the status of research efforts related to violence against nurses, including sources of data and research, and efforts to deve lop standardized definitions of workplace violence. 1.3.1. Sources of Da ta and Research One of the major challenges in documenting the crisis of violence affecting the nurse workforce is the absence of systematic and coordina ted data collection procedures and scant research on these issues. Problems with the availability of data and research include few data sources to determine the magnitude of the problem and variations in definiti ons, data sources, and met hods used in research. Fragmented and inconsistent funding for research, educational program development and testing add additional layers of complexity. Finally, issues exist with curricul ar evaluation on preventing violence in the nursing workplace. Because information on this importa nt topic is limited, it must be collected from numerous sources including web sites, organizations, and government ag encies. While it is important to have uniform categories and definitions for violence in the health care setting, there are no standard reporting definitions or mechanisms for documenting violence in the health care workplace that would facilitate determination of the scope and prevalence of the problem (Gershon, 2001). \"It is important to have uniform categories and definitions for violence in the healthcare setting for a wide range of reasons, not the least of which is to have a uniform surveillance system. Unfortunately, there ar e no standard reporting definitions or mechanisms for health-care workplace violence, and this would be a necessary first step in determini ng the prevalence and scope of the problem at the international level.\" (Gershon, 2001, p.24) There are insufficient health care violence-specifi c measurement and reporting mechanisms in place for compiling reliable data on violent injuries to nursing staff (Love & Morrison, 2003). These authors indicated that among the policy reco mmendations of the American Academy of Nursing Expert Panel on Violence is the development of a national database using consiste nt definitions of injuries and violent events so that the true ex tent of the problem in health car e and educational settings can be measured reliably. They added that until pressure is brought to bear from outside regulatory agencies such as OSHA and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), hospitals must rely on themselves for identifying and managing violence toward health care staff. While OSHA has published workplace prevention guidelines for health care facilities and recommends a zero tolerance level for violence, Love and Morrison (2003) recommend adopting standards instead of guidelines. There is an absence of systematic national data collection on workplace assaults, as well as scarce data evaluating violence preven tion strategies (McPhaul & Lipscomb, 2004). Methodological problems such as reporting overall pr evalence rates as averag es obscure the extremely high levels of aggression experienced in some departments and by specific staff (Winstanley & Whittington, 2004). The NACNEP recommends collecting and analyzing data on workplace violence from government agencies (e.g., Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Justice), health care facilities, community-based settings, and in 18 nursing education to assess the scope and incide nce of workplace violence in Federally funded agencies and track the changes in rates of violence due to policy and procedure interventions. They also recommend assessing the impact of workplace violence on nurse recruitment and retention; assessing management and documentation of the response to violence in the workplace; and disseminating information to health care settings in support of increased violence prevention and management programs. 1.3.2. Standardized Definiti ons of Workplace Violence The dearth of systematic data collection procedur es and sources for reporting and compiling data on violence in the nursing workforce is mirrored by the absence of a standardized definition of workplace violence. The Institute of Medici ne established some common descri ptions and terms to carry out its charge. Violence was defined broadly to include \"physical, emotional, psychological, and sexual harms; the potential for harms; intentional and unintentional injury; and abuse and neglect\" (Cohn, Salmon, & Stobo, 2001, p.17). The magnitude of the problem is difficult to assess. For example, rates vary depending on whether one includes in reporting databases se vere physical injury only as compared to more minor injuries. The report states , \"the heterogeneity of definitions and evidentiary requirements makes accuracy in incidence data ex tremely difficult to achieve\" (Cohn et al., p.22). There is a lack of consistency in defining workplace violence across countries and at national and local levels, although a broad rather than limited defin ition of violence is typically used (Wiskow, 2002). Different definitions of terms like aggression and violence make it di fficult to assess changes in rates over time or across studies (Winstanley & Whittingt on, 2004). \"Social and cultural changes are likely to contribute to the evolution of definitions of ag gression necessitating some adjustment in research definitions, thus making the accuracy and detail of reporting of particular importance\" (Winstanley & Whittington, 2004, p.9). Furthermore, terms that ar e employed can be interpreted differently by different parties. The NACNEP recommends developing and adopting a standard definition of workplace violence and disseminating information on available resources a nd best-practices for violence prevention and management protocols in health care settings. There is little consensus on how to ra nk the degree of violence severit y. This is in part due to many nurses accepting violence as inevitable in the health care workplace (Anderson, 2001). A broad spectrum of behaviors is included am ong those considered to be violen t, threatening, or intimidating. Waddington, Badger, and Bull (2005) interviewed 54 po lice officers and 62 health care professionals and social workers who had experienced episodes of violence in the workplace and found that there were varied meanings and interpretations ascribed to the term \"violence.\" Violence can range from physical assault to attacks directed at property to non-physical aggression in cluding verbal aggression and threats. An inclusive definition of violence can be considered to respect the diversity of experience and the subjective nature of violence, but a broad definition may not be useful in specific applications. The authors proposed a taxonomy of inte rpersonal harm that considers and differentiates factors such as the relationship be tween the parties involved, whether or not the situation is one of conflict, the duration and intensity of the incident(s), the target of th e attack, whether or not the harm was deliberate, whether harm was realized, and whether there were legitimate grounds for complaint. The Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention's (CDC) National Instit ute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) defines workplace violence as \"violent acts (including physical assaults and threats of assaults) directed toward persons at work or on duty\" (National Inst itute of Occupational Safety and Health, 2002, p.1). Violence is defined by the Amer ican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) as \"any act of aggression that causes physical or emotional harm, such as physical assault, rape, verbal a buse, threats (including bomb scares ), and even sexual harassment\" 19 (American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, 1998). While almost one million people become victims of violent crimes each year at work or on duty, many incidents of workplace violence are not reported. 20 1.4. Recommendations Violence in the workplace is ta king a significant toll on the nurs ing profession. Violence, both physical and psychological, has had a negative im pact on nurses' attitudes toward the nursing profession, and recruitment and retention efforts. To address these challenges, the NACNEP is putting forward a set of recommendations in the following four areas: regulatory; educational programs; nursing practice interven tions; and data collection and di ssemination. Through the following recommendations, the NACNEP believes progress can be made in addressing these challenges facing the profession. Regulatory Develop and adopt a standard definition of wo rkplace violence; strengthen and adopt regulatory and/or accrediting agency (e.g., Occupationa l Safety and Health Administration) recommendations on workplace violence in heal th care settings including institutional, community, and academic settings, as a requirement for workplace safety. Educational Programs Target faculty development initiatives on vi olence in nursing focu sing on prevention, early intervention, legal and ethical issues, and acces s to resources and referral systems in both educational and clinical environments. Target funding to support basic a nd continuing education initiativ es focused on evidence-based core competencies (knowledge, attitudes, skills , and behaviors) relate d to workplace violence and violent behaviors. Improve basic and continuing education programs for nursing personnel including faculty, staff, and students, on self-protection in violent situat ions and competency in violence prevention and management. Nursing Practice Interventions Transition the health care culture into one in whic h a secure work environment for nurses and other health care workers is a priority: Establish clear standards for workplace safety supported by resources for the management of violence. Eliminate institutional barriers for a safe wo rk environment by supporting a culture of open communication and reporting among nursing staff, faculty, health care personnel, and students regarding violence in the workplace. Offer violence prevention and manage ment training in the workplace. Keep violence and security issues on the radar screen of risk managers in health care facilities. Provide clearly defined support re sources such as legal and psyc hological services, to nurses in violent situations, or at risk of facing violent situations. Include violence prevention and management in the criteria for the American Nurses Credentialing Center Ma gnet Recognition Program. Support demonstration projects for implementation of best practice models in violence prevention and management in health care settings. 21 Disseminate information on model violence prev ention programs and best practices including programs appropriate for smaller/rural health care facilities. Disseminate information on available resources and best-practices for violence prevention and management protocols in health care settings. Develop guidelines for conducting employee and student background checks on violent behavior. Data Collection and Dissemination Collate and analyze data on workplace violen ce from government agencies (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Occupationa l Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Justice), health care facilities, community-based settings, and in nursing education to: \u0083 Assess the scope and incidence of workplace violence in Federally funded agencies and track the changes in rates of violence due to policy and procedure interventions; \u0083 Assess the impact of workplace violence on nurse recruitment and retention; \u0083 Assess management, documentation, and response to violence in the workplace; and \u0083 Disseminate information to health care settin gs in support of increased violence prevention and management programs.

Nurse Critical Shortage Facility Study Background Study approach Study progress Preliminary update 27 2. Nurse Critical Shortage Facility Study A two-year study was conducted at the Center for Health Workforce Studies at the State University of New York (SUNY), Albany, to identify the essen tial components of a comprehensive, national methodology for identifying facilities and communities with critical shortages of registered nurses (RNs). This study is ongoing. At the meeting, Ms . Jean Moore, Project Director, discussed the following aspects of the study: Background; Study approach; Study progress; and Preliminary update. Background There are continuing general shortages of RNs across the country. These shortages are attributed to declining enrollments in RN e ducation programs and to RNs\u2014young RNs, as well as retirees\u2014leaving the workforce. Since 1996, the number of RNs per capita in the U.S. has decreased as the supply of RNs has grown more slowly than the U.S. population. In part, as a result of th is shortage, the number of projected RN job openings from the present until 2010 is more than 1 million. The National Center for Health Workforce Analysis predicts that the RN shortage will grow from an estimated 6 percent in 2000 to an estimated shortage of 20 percent in 2020. Another issue is the lack of ethnic diversity in the nursing workforce. While foreign-trained nurses appear to contribute substantia lly, in many cases these nurses are not culturally competent for the populations they serve. For example, most foreign-born nurses in New York City are from the Philippines, but a plurality of Asians in New York City are Chinese. Initiatives administered by the Federal government to address the shortage include programs and policies to increase the pipeline to produce more nur ses, improve retention, use RNs more efficiently, optimize immigration of nurses, and provide data about the workfo rce to inform policy decisions. As part of this effort, in 2004, the Health Resour ces and Services Administration (HRSA) issued a Request for Proposals for a two-year research project to gather inform ation and insights in support of the development of a new methodology for identifyi ng health care facilities and communities with critical shortages of RNs. HRSA's decision to su pport this research was base d in large part on their concern that its current method fo r identifying facilities and commun ities with shorta ges of RNs was too narrow in scope and that RN shortages were li kely to worsen over the next 20 years. The New York Center for Health Workforce Studies at SUNY Albany was selected to conduct this study. Study Approach The primary goal of this study was to conduct research on the necessary components of a comprehensive, nationwide methodology to identify f acilities and communities w ith critical shortages of RNs across the U.S. and its terr itories in order to target the pl acement of Federally obligated RN scholars and loan repayers. Key objectives of the study include: Identify and define indicators and measures that reflect critical RN shortages for the various types of facilities; 28 Assess the availability of data sets that can be used to determine RN staffing needs nationally; Develop quantifiable key measures of nursing shortages based on key indicators described above as well as the available data sets that include the necessary data to calculate the key measures; Determine whether these key measures of shorta ge can be incorporated into a comprehensive national methodology to identify facilities a nd communities with criti cal nursing shortages based on the following criteria: \u0083 The measure accurately quantifies nursing shorta ges in a specific health care setting; and \u0083 The measure either can be calculated using an available national data set or the data can be collected and validated at the facility level; Establish an analytic framework that can be used for a comprehensive methodology to determine critical nursing s hortages across a variety of health care settings. The study was conducted under the guidance of four expe rt advisory panels, one for each of four types of health care organizations: hospitals, home h ealth agencies, nursing homes, and public health agencies. Ultimately, this research will support the development of a comprehensive method for identifying the health care facilities and communities with critical shortages of RNs. This will permit more effective targeting of Federa l and other resources to encourage service-obligated RNs to work in the facilities and communities with the greatest needs. Study Progress The panels' first meetings were in February 2005. Outcomes from the initial meetings included a set of guiding principles. A range of theoretical principles and ideals were developed. These are listed below: Context: facility within community . Both facility and community characteristics must be considered, but community charac teristics are more important than facility characteristics. Demand over need . Analyses should primarily focus on employer demand for RNs (e.g., what the local labor market will actually support) ra ther than the health needs of the population. High-need areas that have no resources or infr astructure to employ a dditional RNs would find little benefit in the Nursing Educa tion Loan Repayment Program (NELRP). Identify standards for data. Ultimately, it will be important to upgrade Federal, state, and local data systems to support better planning fo r the nursing workforce including the designation of facilities and communities with shortages of RNs. Consider facility culture . Some facilities may experience high RN vacancies not because of difficulties recruiting RNs, but because of persistent RN turnover due to problems of organizational culture within the facility (e.g., poor management). This is not a \"shortage\" issue, and the NELRP program is not intended to address such problems. Define shortage based on outcomes . Theoretically, a facility can be said to have \"too few\" RNs when there are not enough RNs for the faci lity to function eff ectively. This will be observed in certain outcome measures relating to quality of care and facility functioning. 29 The principles and ideals relating to practical concerns included: Low administrative burden on facilities and HRSA. Data used in the final methodology should not require a large-scale data collection or manipulation. Applicable to all facility types . The final shortage methodology should be applicable to and appropriate for all facility types. Readily available data over time . Ideally, the final met hodology should be supported by existing data that are easy to acce ss and available over time for updating. Commonly accepted data elements and indicators . Using established in dicators of supply, demand, and shortage is prefer able to developing new ones. Easy to update to reflect changing environment . Data used for identifying shortages should be easy to update so that designations can be periodically reexamined. The principles and ideals relating to fairness included: Attention to rural and urban differences . The shortage designation method should not systematically disadvantage eith er rural or urban facilities. Special needs of some facilities . The shortage designation method should recognize extenuating circumstances (e.g., facing critical problems, serving sp ecial populations). Case mix of patients. The method should recognize that some facilities have higher patient acuity than others which may signify that so me facilities require mo re intensive staffing. Accommodate data manipulation . The method should minimize opportunities for facilities and communities to \"game\" the system to achieve a shortage designation. These guiding principles will influence the developm ent of the methodology, but data availability will create some constraints. While finding the right indicators will be a key objective of the study, there are other important issues that will be more difficult to resolve. These issues include determining how shortage-facility designations will occur, how often designations will be updated, and how resources will be allocated by setting type. Preliminary Update While working on different options, staff considered the possibility of incorporating the HRSA Nurse Supply Model (NSM) and Nurse Demand Model (NDM) into the RN shortage designation process. Although the exact analyses included in the NDM could not be replicated at th e county level due to data constraints, the basic logic employed in the NDM was very useful in thinking about demand for RNs. The decision was made to apply a simplified vers ion of the NDM logic to: 1) estimate health care utilization in different settings for counties (e.g., inpatient days); 2) estimate current national RN staffing by setting (e.g., RNs working in inpatient units ); 3) calculate national RN staffing intensity for each setting (e.g., RNs per inpatient da y); 4) apply national RN staffing intensity ratios to measures of utilization for each county; and 5) sum estimat e demand for each setting to produce overall RN demand for individual countie s. Each step is summarized briefly below. 1. Estimate Health Care Utilization The data on county-level health car e utilization came primarily from the Area Resource File (ARF). The ARF included data on short-term inpatient days (non-psychiatric hospitals); nursing home unit inpatient days (hospitals); outpatient visits (non-emergency); and emergency department visits. The number of (non-hospital) nursing home reside nts in a county was obtained from the 2000 Census. This was based on the Census short-form data which is theoretically obtained from 100 percent of the U.S. population. The number of home health patients per county was es timated using the age and gender distribution of the population, based upon national age- specific and gender-specific uti lization rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although this estimate was based upon population charac teristics rather than actual use of services, home health patients by definition were receiving services where they live, so this was somewhat less problematic than estimating other types of util ization based upon population characteristics. 2. Estimate Current National RN Staffing Data for current levels of RN staffing by setti ng were taken from the 2000 NSSRN, which included data on the number of RNs employed in the foll owing types non-hospital ambulatory care; and other nursing care. These numbers were combined with the national utilizat ion data described above to comput e national levels of RN staffing intensity for the various types of care. 3. Estimating RN Demand by County These national staffing ratios were then applied to the utilization rates for each county. For example, the national ratio was 4.97 RNs working in hospital i npatient units per inpatient day. If County A has 12,000 inpatient days per year, their demand for RNs in inpatient units is estimated at 59.6 (4.97 x [12,000/1,000]). Overall RN demand for the county was obtained by summing RN demand in the county across all settings. (This procedure also opens the possibi lity of comparing setting-specific demand to setting- specific supply if data on RN supply by se tting are available at the county level). 4. Use Supply of RNs to Estimate RN Shortages RN shortages in each county were estimated as follows: RN shortage = [Estimated Demand] - [Estimated Supply (adjusted for commuting)] These raw shortage estimates were then standardized as a percent of demand. This method has advantages over any of the other met hods examined in this study especially in relation to the guiding principles initiall y proposed for the study. It uses nationally available data that is periodically updated, it uses actual health care utilization patterns by county, it accounts for multiple types of nursing care (including non-clinical services), and it accounts for differences in RN staffing intensity across settings. The NDM uses factors such as HMO penetration and LPN staffing in regressions to adjust estimated staffing intensity and make it specific to each county rather than applying na tional ratios. A similar procedure might eventually be used to do the same thing here. 31 3. Nursing Workforce Diversity Program Exemplars Caring For Our Own Partnership Preparing the Next Ge neration of Nurses Pathways Into Nursing Success Pathways: Introducing Nursing as a Career Option 32 3. Nursing Workforce Diversity Program Exemplars The Nursing Workforce Diversity Program Exempl ars panel was convened to share successes and accomplishments of programs funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administrati on, Bureau of Health Professions, Division of Nursing to highlight successful examples of nurse e ducation projects for individuals from disadvantaged and minority backgrounds. The four programs presented here are: Caring for Our Own Partnership (CO-OP); Preparing the Next Gene ration of Nurses (NGN); Pathways into Nursing (PIN); and Success Pathways into Nursing. 3.1. Caring for Our Own Partnership Kathleen Chafey, PhD RN, Professor and Director, Caring for Our Own Program Frederica Lefthand, M.S., Assistant Di rector, Caring for Our Own Program Montana State University College of Nursing Summary The Caring for Our Own Partnership (CO-OP) was crea ted after 20 years of trying to retain American Indian students at Montana State University (M SU) without success. It was funded in 1999 by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). There is a critical need for Ameri can Indian Bachelor of Science (B SN) graduates to improve health outcomes for American Indians. To achieve th is, the partnership proposes workforce diversity, culturally competent, sensitive care, and BSN opportunities for American Indian students. Based on per capita income, unemployment, and percentage of families in poverty, American Indians are at the bottom of the economic ladder. There is no American Indian industry in Montana. Reservation unemployment is up to 70 percent. Approximately 25 percent of American Indian households do not have enough food to meet basic need s. The State has a commitment to American Indians in its constitution, but the education syst em has been unable or unwilling to commit resources to American Indian students. There is a high American Indian student enro llment in 92 percent of schools identified for improvement. Additionally, American Indian studen ts' test scores are below the 50th percentile on standardized tests, and almost half of all schools on or near reservat ions did not make adequate yearly progress. American Indian students face many challenges including: College is not usually an expecta tion of American Indian students; More than 80 percent of American Indian stud ents are the first generation to attend college; 33 More than 90 percent of American Indian students come from reservation schools; American Indian students face emotional and social obstacles from both worlds; Students feel inadequate, lack confidence, and fear that instructors don't trust them or are \"out to get them\"; and Students have deficits in writing, math, and science. In order to qualify for CO-OP, students must expr ess commitment to the health care of American Indians. CO-OP develops a rapport with students, parents, health care providers, and advisors. The retention effort begins the first summer with an intensive three-to-fou r-week tutoring program. Additionally, in August there is a Bridge Program that addresses a range of topics to prepare students both academically and in other areas. For example, all students review study skills and time management. Also provided are academic prev iews of all courses and non-academic activities such as finalizing financial aid, housing, and child care. Dr. Chafey and Ms. Lefthand recommended greater funding specifically for minority bachelor-level education for American Indian students. They ur ged committee members to review their literature on the program. The National Advisory Council on Nurse Educa tion and Practice (NACNEP) discussion on the presentation included: Students arrive either as freshmen or as transfers from tribal colleges. The retention program begins with recruiting by working with middl e school and high school students on reservations, plus after-school activities. Regarding the American Indian student perception that faculty are \"out to get them,\" the CO-OP initially planned standard cu ltural competence tests and disc ussions with faculty about improving teaching; however, a single approach could not be determined because there are American Indian students from many tribes with disparate cultures. To support these students to work through academic and student life challenges, CO-OP managers talk about the CO-OP being \"family away from family.\" The important point is to let students know they will be supported. Among the graduates, many have volunteered to c ounsel undergraduate students in the program. 34 Caring for Our Own Partnership Kathleen Chafey, PhD RN, Professor and Director, Caring for Our Own Program Frederica Lefthand, M.S., Assistant Di rector, Caring for Our Own Program Montana State University College of Nursing Introduction Recent national studies have concluded that increasing the number of minority health professionals in the health professions workforce is a key strategy in addressing serious and persistent disparities in the health and health care of minority members of the population. The perc entage of the registered nurse (RN) workforce appears adequate relative to the U. S. population of American Indians. However, in areas of the country where there are significant numbers of American Indian people (6.5 percent of Montana's population, for example, according to the U. S. Bureau of the Census, as compiled by the Census and Economic Information Center, Montana Department of Commerce, 2001) and where there is a virtual majority in counties that contain larg e reservations, American I ndian nurses are seriously under-represented. Furthermore, American Indian nurse s have the lowest percen tage of graduates with baccalaureate degrees and are am ong the least likely to have master's or doctoral degrees. For health and illness care, American Indians depend primarily on Indian Health Service health professionals who are largely from other, non-American Indian cultur es. If the goals of Healthy People 2010 are to be realized, there is, and will continue to be, a critical need for more American Indian graduates of baccalaureate and higher degree programs who can help improve health outcomes. American Indian graduates so prepared will provid e greater access to high quality, cult urally competent, and sensitive health care and leadership in changing th e care environment for their own people. The purpose of the Caring for Our Own Program (CO- OP) at Montana State University (MSU) is to increase nursing education opportuniti es for American Indian students who wish to pursue a university education in nursing. The project has been ma de possible through support from the Division of Nursing Workforce Diversity Program. The purpose of this paper is to outline the successes and challenges encountered in recrui ting and retaining American Indi an students through graduation and licensure. This paper will focus special attention on caree r awareness and school persistence activities with middle and high school youth and will conclude with observations and experiences that the National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Pr actice (NACNEP) may wish to consider in its future policy deliberations. Context for the CO-OP Program The following data provide the contextual backgr ound from which CO-OP stude nts are recruited with regard to: Economic disparities; Health disparities; and Educational disparities. Economic Disparities According to most economic indicators, Montan a lags behind the rest of the Nation. For all economic indicators, Montana's American In dian people lag behind the State as a whole and are far under norms for the Nation as a whole. With respect to per capita income, unemployment, percent of families in 35 poverty, the plight of single moms , and students needing food supplem ents, American Indian people are at the bottom of the economic ladder. In addition, unlike other states with high concentrations of American Indian people, there is no American Indian gaming industry in Montana so that without education and the prospect of ne w reservation industries, there are currently few prospects for economic improvement. Per capita personal income in Montana for 2003 wa s $25,775, fourth from the bottom among all states. Nearly 20 percent of youth (age 17 and younger) were living in poverty in 2003. With respect to average annual pay ($26,000 in 2002), Montana ranke d last among the 50 states. The income and employment picture for American In dians is quite different than that of Montana as a whole. For example, the median income on Montana reserv ations was $9,600 per year and 2000 census data showed that 31 percent of American Indian families on Indian reservations served by the proposed project had incomes below the poverty line compared to 10.5 percent for Montana as a whole. There is no American Indian gaming industry in Montana, and the 2000 annual per cap ita income on American Indian reservations ranges fr om $7,736 on the Northern Cheyenne reservation (with a median household income of $23,679) to $14,503 on the Flathead reservation where 91 percent of the people are Caucasian, non-Hispanic. In 2003, the unemploymen t rate ranged from a low of 11.6 percent to 58 percent compared to the overall Mo ntana rate of 4.2 percent. The St ate of Montana reports an average unemployment rate for Montana reservations of 11 percent. According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, however, the unemployment ra te on reservations is much higher. The cost of one year at the university is approximately $12,000 for tuition, fees, room, board, and books. Given this cost, without financial incentives, staff support, and assistance made possible by programs such as the Workforce Diversity Program, few students would even consider a univer sity education in nursing. Health Disparities In a state that is among the poorest in the Nation, over half of the 52,000 American Indians in Montana live primarily on tribal lands and c onfront serious and persistent heal th problems as well as economic and social deficits. The most prevalent health problems are complex and vary by Indian Health Service (IHS) areas and from reservation to reservat ion within those areas. A closer examination of the health disparities under scores the need for high quality, culturally-competent nursing care for this underserved population. Poor health and chronic, disabling conditions are linked to poverty and unemployment; inadequate nutrition, education, and housing; alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, particularly methamphetamine. In addition, many American Indian people, especially in the West, live in isolated rural areas where great distances, weat her, lack of transportation, and few telephones prevent ready access to health care. Children and youth are partic ularly vulnerable to health problems linked to poverty, isolation, and lifestyle, especially poor nutr ition, food insecurity, a nd, in many cases, hunger. The U.S. Department of Agriculture found that 2 2.2 percent of American Indian households were food-insecure (meaning they did not have enough f ood to meet their basic needs) during the period from 1995 to 1997. They also found that one out of twelve households experienced food insecurity with hunger in the same period. Fo r American Indians in Montana in 2002, including both sexes and all ages, the leading causes of death (stated as pe rcentages of total deaths ) included: cancer (20 percent), accidents (18 percent), and heart disease (16 percent). Deaths of males accounted for 65 percent of the deaths from h eart disease, 47 percent of the cancer deaths, 58 percent of the motor-vehicle accidental deaths, and 63 percent of non-motor vehicle accidental deaths. \"Unintentional injuries\" (includi ng motor vehicle and other accide nts) was the leading cause of death in every age category from age 5 to age 44 for Montana American Indians, for both sexes in 2001. 36 Infant mortality (2003) for American Indians (including Aleuts and Eskimos) showed an alarming 7.8 percent increase between 1995 a nd 2001. The rate for 2001 was 9.7 per 1000 live births for this population compared with 6.7 per 1000 live births for the United State (all races). Additional data on infant mo rtality revealed that: \u0083 In the Aberdeen area of the Indian Health Service (Eastern Montana/North and South Dakota/Nebraska) it is estimated ther e are 17 deaths per 1,000 live births. \u0083 For American Indians 25 percent of the elevated infant mortality rate has been attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). \u0083 Maternal smoking has also been linked to adverse birth outcomes and in Montana, approximately 42 percent of all American Indian adults smoke (double th e prevalence rate of 21 percent for all Montanans). In 1995, life expectancy at birth (Billings Ar ea IHS) was 67.2 for both sexes compared to United States (all races) of 75.8. \u0083 The median age of death for American Indian women was 65, for all other women, it was 81. \u0083 The median age of death for American Indian men was 57; for Caucasian men, it was 75. Educational Disparities Montana has a significant populatio n of minority, rural, underserv ed, and profoundly disadvantaged students. In order to make a majo r impact on the workforce of American Indian nurses and to increase and enhance the pool of future applicants, there n eeds to be major attentio n given to educational inequities that characteri ze reservation and near-reservation school s and that create barriers for their graduates. The learning environm ent for students living on or near reservations, coupl ed with poverty and cultural barriers, makes a college education difficu lt to attain. Educationa l attainment of Montana American Indian students lags far behind other groups in Montana, as described in part in the latest 2003-2004 American Indian Education Data Fact Sheet from the Montana Office of Public Instruction: 11 percent of Montana's school age (K- 12) population was American Indian. 92 percent of schools identified for improveme nt had high numbers of American Indian enrollments. 60 percent of students in schools on or near reservations are e ligible for free/reduced lunch (compared with the Montana rate of 35 percent). The American Indian high school dropout rate is steady, whereas the overall dropout rate for Montana high schools has been declining. Test scores for American Indian studen ts have typically ranked below the 50th percentile on standardized tests. 49 percent of all schools on or near reservations did not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). Given the median household income on Montana rese rvations relative to the annual cost of in- state tuition and fees at MSU ($12,000 per year), it is not surp rising that without financial incentives and staff support made possible by programs such as Workforce Diversity, few students would aspire to a uni versity education in nursing. In October 2004, a summit hosted by the Office of Public Instruction brought together nearly 200 educators and community leaders to help develop an action plan to eliminate the American Indian student achievement gap. However, the povert y and unemployment that plagues reservation 37 communities is also reflected in lower funding levels for schools and low teacher salaries. The Montana constitution is unique among states with sizab le American Indian populat ions in terms of its constitutional commitment to American Indian education: \"It is the goal of the people to establish a system of education which will develop the full e ducational potential of e ach person. Equality of educational opportunity is guaranteed to each person of the state. The state recognizes the distinct and unique cultural heritage of American Indians an d is committed in its educational goals to the preservation of their cult ural integrity.\" Unfortunately for Montana students, the resources needed to ensure quality education for American Indian students have not followed the commitment, and low high school graduation rates precl ude positive economic growth. Challenges in Recruiting American Indian Youth To achieve the project's purposes, CO-OP staff and members have had to work within both the university community and reservation communities to overcome negative attitude s about the feasibility or desirability of American Indian students comp leting a university education. A major focus of our efforts is to help students and their families cope with the realities of living in two worlds. These students do not simply leave home and move on with their lives to attend college like thousands of majority students who have the expectation of a college education since childhood. Attending college and preparing for college is a foreign concept for many of these student s and their families. Baccalaureate preparation for nurses requires leaving the reservation and families, often for several years; university education has b een considered \"too hard,\" \"too expe nsive,\" and former students have shared many incidents of racism in off-reservation towns and even in the cla ssrooms of the university. Nursing students in previous gene rations report being told \"American Indian students could not make it in nursing\" by teachers and advisors, and these experiences have been shared with others in their communities. Finally, as in many other rural, isolated communities where higher education is not necessarily valued or supported, those who choose to leave the reservation to pursue careers requiring higher degrees may be discouraged by family who do not want them to leave. Peers who choose not to go on to college, or even finish high school, may also communicate to the college-bound studen t that he or she is \"wasting time and money\" or even that the college-bound student thinks himself or hers elf \"better than\" those who choose not to leave the reservation. These stude nts often hear remarks such as: \"you think you're better than us, just because you go to college,\" or \"she acts like a white girl because she's in college,\" or \"don't you know where you belong?\" Sometimes the rigors of academic life become particularly burdensome, or students experience racism in the cl assroom or in a clinical setting. When this happens, the students may feel compelled to return home. Consequently, students often respond to difficult situations with comments like \"maybe I don't belong here\" or \"maybe I would have been better off just staying home\" and \"my mom told me not to come here.\" The success of this project in overcoming barriers to recruitment and retention is attributable in part to the lengthy partnership-building that took place prior to applyi ng for HRSA funds. CO-OP staff initially worked, and continue to work, with trib al stakeholders on three Montana reservations to promote career opportunities in nursing and the development of awar eness, motivation, and confidence that a university educat ion in nursing was valuable, achievable, and affordable for reservation youth. CO-OP staff members have made connections with school children and youth, th eir parents, teachers, and counselors to build a sense of trust that staffers will shepherd their students through the college experience. Tribal leaders have been recruited, including educators and hea lth professionals on the reservations who agreed to serv e on reservation-based advisory boa rds. Board members have been generous in their support, helping by sharing their perceptions of this program in their communities, and identifying and mentoring interested prospect ive students beginning with middle school youth. 38 High school students and tribal colle ge transfers are encouraged and tribal colleges assisted in the application process and in securing tribal funding. By creating opportunities for individual American Indian students, th e project has contributed to the supply, distribution, diversity, and qu ality of the health care workfor ce accessible to rural underserved populations. It has also helped build a pipeline reaching to students now in elementary school. The CO-OP now has tribal networks fo r student recruitment and support in seven reservations (six in Montana and one in Wyoming). The project's recruite r (a member of the Crow Nation who is also the Assistant Project Director) travels thousands of miles each year across Montana and Wyoming. Many hundreds of contacts are made each year with middle- and high school students, counselors, and parents attending career fairs, health fairs, Pow Wows, and even basketball tournaments. The CO-OP staff play host to numerous busloads of students on field trips to the university and organize summer activities for prospective students as well as after-school he alth professions career nights to encourage persistence in school and pursuit of a college-prep curriculum. As a result of effective partnering and recruiting, the number of American Indian majors in nursing has grown from 14 when the project began in 1999, to 39 in the fall semester of 2004. The number of prospective students\u2014graduating high school seniors who have declared their intentio n to attend MSU and major in nursing\u2014has increased from 29 in 1999, to 74 in 2005. Challenges in Retaining American Indian Nursing Students Educational achievement of Montan a's Indian youth lags far behind other groups in Montana as noted above. Lack of educational preparation, motivation, and financing for higher education help to explain why American Indians represent onl y 2 percent of the total student population at MSU, well below the representation of American Indians in the general population (6.5 percent). In the College of Nursing , on the other hand, American Indi ans now comprise 5 percent of the student population and the percentage is growing. The HRSA Nursing Workfo rce Diversity Project has made it possible for the CO-OP program to help students confront a nd overcome educational deficits that posed insurmountable barriers in earlier years. During the first five years of HRSA funding, the Co llege of Nursing graduated 22 American Indian students, twice the number who grad uated in the 5 years prior to gr ant funding. All but one has passed the national licensing (NCLEX-RN) examination on the first attempt and has moved into the professional nursing workforce. It should be noted that over 80 percent of our students are in the first generation of their families to attend college and over 90 percent of our students graduate from reservation high schools. These stud ents often come with deficiencies in academic subjects such as writing, math, and science, but also often lack experience writing papers , doing homework, and taking tests. For most, however able they are, the adju stment to academic and social life hundreds of miles from home is a difficult, and sometimes impossible transition. We believe that retention efforts must be im plemented early, beginning with emphasizing school persistence and academic focus by middle school childr en. In other words, the recruitment component of the program includes laying the groundwork for re tention, regardless of whether or not students ultimately declare nursing as a major. Minority college students are most vulnerable during the first year when they are trying to adjust to the multiple dimensions of college life. The more we can do to prepare them for this transition, both academically a nd socially, the greater will be the likelihood that the retention program will succeed. Once students are accepted to the university and th e CO-OP program, the college retention program begins with a three- to four-week intensive review of writing, mat h, and science concepts during the summer between high school and the freshman year for new students. Following the end of the new 39 student summer intensive, all students\u2014freshmen, tr ansfers, and continuing students\u2014complete a one- week bridge program to review study skills and ti me management concepts, prepare for the new school year, finalize financial aid, hous ing and child-care arrangements, develop class schedules, and purchase books. During this peri od, new students are also introduced to academic coursework at the university, sample courses such as anatomy and physiology using the cadaver lab, and become familiar with medical terminology and health assessment with continuing student s acting as mentors. Because these preparatory programs are out side the regular semester calendar, we have also begun a \"mini- bridge\" between semesters to allow students to work in group tutorials to help them prepare for the courses they will be taking in the second semester. All students are expected to achieve a 2.50 grade point average each semester in order to be eligible for a stipend the next semester. All students are placed on an individualized academic contract that: Requires attendance at all classes; Requires they spend two hours of supervised stud y time for every hour they are in classes or labs; Requires attendance at all tutoring sessi ons whether individual or group; Requires they attend two hours of CO-OP seminar per week; and Requires attendance at an intensive two-da y NCLEX preparatory program once during the junior year and again during the senior year. The CO-OP program, for its part offers each student: An individualized plan for tutoring based on the student's grades in previous classes and other indicators of confidence and co mfort with the courses on the sc hedule (generally, new students are assigned to tutorials in every required cla ss and these tutorials are offered one or two hours per week, more if needed); Help with non-academic issues that interfere with academic achievement (this includes housing, child-care, financial aid counse ling, referrals for personal counseling and career counseling, and assistance arranging summer employment, internships, job shadowing, and contact with nurse mentors on partner reservations); and Help for American Indian students by CO-OP sta ff members to deal with the demands of living in two worlds by becoming the student's family away from their family. This last point is perhaps the most important reten tion strategy we offer. The CO-OP program refers both to American Indian nurses ca ring for their own people but also caring for our own (American Indian) students. As mentioned before, it is usually very difficult for our students to leave their reservations. Over 80 percent are the first generation in their families to attend college. Several of our students come from traditional backgrounds in which attending ceremonies and other cultural events are extremely important. American Indian peopl e value having strong family and extended family support. The bigger a family is, th e wealthier a person is seen to be . Through the development of the CO-OP \"learning community,\" staff and peers soon become part of the student's extended family. The program helps bolster the student's self-esteem and confidence to enable them to do the work needed to complete their degrees. The final component of the retention program is to help the student who, for whatever reason, must withdraw from the program. We know that nursi ng is not for everyone, nor perhaps is a college education. However, we want the withdrawing student , insofar as possible, to have positive feelings 40 about the college experience and their own efforts. We want the studen ts to return if and when they can; if they cannot, we hope they will refer others to the program. Summary of Progress, 1999 to 2005 The CO-OP project began in 1999 w ith three reservation partners and six new American Indian students who joined the eight Amer ican Indian students already in the nursing program. The aim of the project was to address low enrollment and gradua tion rates of American Indian nursing students. Since the project foci include building enrollme nts and graduation rates and increasing cultural competence of students and faculty, funding for the program was sought after grassroots support was built for the program on the part of stakeholders on the reservation and the College of Nursing faculty and the administration. Highlights of accomplishments include the following: Twenty-two students have graduated from the pr ogram to date. Most are practicing in rural communities and/or with underserved populations; CO-OP enrollment has increased from 14 American Indian students in the fall semester of 1999 to 39 students in the fall semest er of 2004, a 178 percent increase; In 1999, American Indian students made up 2.8 per cent of College of Nursing enrollments. In the fall semester of 2004 American Indian students made up 5 pe rcent of enrollments, and first- time American Indian students made up 9.8 pe rcent of the entering cohort of students; In March 1999 (just before the start of th e program) there were 26 students on the MSU prospective American Indian nur sing students list. In March of 2005 there were 74 prospective students; The current average grade point aver age of all CO-OP students is 2.69; In the last three years, thr ee CO-OP students (graduating senior s) have earned straight A averages and two students have been named College of Nursing Student of the Year; All but one of 22 graduates si nce 1999 has passed the RN licen sing exam on the first attempt; One graduate will enter graduate school (Ph.D.) in the fall semester 2005 and will work part- time as a CO-OP staff member in a faculty role; Three key CO-OP staff members are enrolled member s of Montana American Indian tribes as is a fourth part-time staff member who assists with pre-entry activiti es and outreach; and One CO-OP staff member (a member of a Montan a American Indian trib e) began junior level coursework in nursing in the fall of 2005. Policy Implications In the Third Report to the Secret ary of Health and Human Services and to the Congress, the NACNEP reaffirmed its goal that \"by 2010 two-thirds of the RN workforce should have at least a baccalaureate degree and to help those eligible to become faculty members...\" (N ational Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice, 2003). As evidenced in p eer reviews for Nursing Workforce Diversity grant applications, it is the author's impression that the pressure to increase the size and diversity of the workforce has resulted in a prolifer ation of applications for career ladder programs that too often end with associate degrees. In addition, too often these applications seem to em phasize recruitment. Pre- entry activities are often composed mainly of the administration of batteries of tests, and/or the retention program depends heavily on peer mentori ng with little meaningful faculty involvement. Given the challenges described abov e and through the lens of our own experience, the staff of the CO- 41 OP program would recommend that greater funding be allocated specifically for baccalaureate education, specifically for minority students for the following reasons: Meaningful and successful education of minor ity students in baccalaureate programs is an expensive, staff-intensive, and lengthy process when compared to associate degree programs. Yet, to address effectively the serious and persistent disparities in the hea lth and health care of minority members of the population, we need to make it possible for minority students to have a comprehensive university experience that emphasizes the goal of educating , not just graduating. For American Indian nursing students, higher ed ucation must take into account their \"two worlds\" perspective. Quoting American Indian educator Ardys Bowker: We must redefine Indian education from the perspective of Indians. We must develop an educational program that gives meaning to our lives as Indians and to our culture while at the same time instructing students in the underlying ideas of the American culture and providing th e intellectual tools needed to su rvive in a cont emporary, global society. This assessment fits well with what we are tr ying to accomplish in the CO-OP program. Given the health profile of American Indian people, there is a tremendous need for nurses and nurse leaders whose knowledge and prac tice of nursing is built on a so lid foundation of sciences and humanities. Nationally, the nursing workforce needs not just more nurses, also but more competent practitioners and leaders who come from diverse populations. Sc hools of nursing need minority faculty with advanced degrees who can help address h ealth care issues of minority patients, provide role models for minority st udents, and teach other faculty and students cultural competence. University education is an expensive investment that can yield enormous returns. Especially for American Indian students, university education is a co stly investment but the students can benefit enormously. If our workforce diversity programs can successfully foster the social and intellectual growth of students, we will truly be caring for our own for decades, even generations to come. Thank you for your continuing investment in the ideal of diversity. 42 References for Caring for Our Own Partnership Billings Gazette. (2001).

Preparing the Next Generation of Nurses Astrid H. Wilson, RN, DSN Professor of Nursing Clayton College and State University Summary Clayton College and State University (CCSU) (s oon to be Clayton State University) is a small university just south of Atlanta. With 6,000 students, Clayton has the highest minority representation in Georgia except for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In total, there are currently eight projects in HBCUs, ei ght in minority-serving institutions, and two in tribal universities. The three major objectives of the Next Generation of Nurses (NGN) project are: Develop pre-entry preparation for high school ju niors and seniors and college freshmen and sophomores; Develop focused retention efforts for enrolled junior and senior nursing students; and Provide student stipends to support financially disadvantaged students. The efforts of the project counselor and the liaison to the Center for Academic Assistance who worked with NGN students have been successful. There are also plans for a nursing forum in the summer of 2005 and forum members have been identified. The forum provides an opportunity for students to be exposed to nurses and the profession. The pre-entry preparation for high school students made it easy to de vise individual ized study plans and included a national speaker who has developed an instrument to measure cultural competence. Among the impacts were post-test SAT scores ranging from 790 to 1,050 with 53 percent of the students scoring high enough to be admitted to CCSU. Retention efforts for enrolled j uniors and seniors included two se minars by Dr. Ora Strickland to develop nursing faculty for the ment or role and stipends for both students and faculty. In 2003, there were eight faculty members (mentors) for 19 studen ts, and in 2004, there were nine faculty members (mentors) for 33 students. Parents were also invited to sessions to obtain their support. Among the lessons learned were that: Minority and disadvantaged st udents can be successful; Flexibility and adaptability are necessary; and Faculty development in cultural competence and mentoring is vital. 45 Preparing the Next Generation of Nurses Astrid H. Wilson, RN, DSN Professor of Nursing Clayton College and State University Preparing the Next Generation of Nurses Preparing the next generation of nurses is a challenge for nurse educat ors especially for those who also want to increase nursing workforce diversity. The admission standards and competition for limited slots in nursing programs sometimes inhibits mi nority and disadvantaged students from being accepted. One way to meet the challenge is for nurse educators to provide pre-entry academic enhancement programs for minority and disadvantaged students interested in nursing as a career. The purpose of this article is to disc uss a project entitled \"Preparing th e Next Generation of Nurses (NGN)\" at Clayton College and State University (CCSU) , which is one approach to increasing nursing workforce diversity. CCSU is a senior institution of the University Syst em of Georgia educationa l consortium that is governed by the Georgia Board of Regents. The Un iversity is located in Morrow, Georgia within Clayton County. CCSU's core mission is to prepare st udents to succeed in the workplace of the 21st century and to provide services and continuing e ducation that will improve the quality of life for residents of the Southern Crescen t, the State, the Nation, and the world. Currently, CCSU enrolls over 5,900 students and offers majors that include App lied Biology, Teacher Education, Nursing, Health Care Management, Dental Hygiene, Psychol ogy and Human Services, Music, and Technology Management, among others. In 2004, 62 percent of the CCSU students were from minority ethnic groups with a breakdown of 48.9 percent African-Ame rican, 6.5 percent Asian/ Pacific Islanders, 6.6 percent all other (Hispanic, multiracial and American Indian) and 38 percent Caucasian. The diversity of the CCSU student body closely reflects the changing popu lation of its county service area. One- third of the students at CCSU are under 22 years of age with a median age of 28. In 2004, U.S. News & World Report ranking of colleges identified CCSU as having the most diverse student population among comprehensive baccalaureate-level colleges and uni versities in the southeastern U.S. other than historically black colleges. Clearly CCSU is positioned well to enroll diverse students. Several factors are important in the consideration of the need for a project su ch as the national nursing workforce. At the national level, the Bureau of Health Professions has es tablished an outcome to increase the number of minority/dis advantaged graduates and/or prog ram completers. Data from the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses - Ma rch 2000 shows that 86.6 per cent of the registered nurse population was non-Hispanic Caucasian, while 13.4 percent were from underrepresented minorities (4.9 percent non-Hispanic Black, 3.5 per cent Asian, 2.0 percent Hispanic and 0.5 percent American Indian) (Bureau of Health Professions, Division of Nu rsing, 2000). These numbers compare poorly to the U.S. population as a whole where 75.1 percent are non- Hispanic Caucasian, 12.3 percent are Black or African American, 0.9 percent are Am erican Indian, 3.6 percent are Asian, 5.5 percent report some other race and 2.5 percent report two or more races (Georgia Health Workforce Cooperative, 2002). In 1996 Georgia reported 712.5 RNs per 100,000 populati on. This number fell significantly below the national average of 797 RNs per 100,000 population (B ureau of Health Professions, Division of Nursing, 2000). Georgia actually ra nks 43rd of the 50 states for RNs per population. Other data from 46 the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses - March 2000 suggests that the number of employed nurses per 100,000 population has now fallen to 683 although the overa ll rank has not changed. In 2005, the statewide vacancy rate for RN positions was 13 percent. In the Atlant a metropolitan area the vacancy rate has already topped 15 percent. In addition, there is a projected need for increased RN employment of 38.9 percent versus the national growth in RN employment opportunities of 20.9 pe rcent (Georgia Health Workforce Cooperative, 2002). Georgia's RN workforce is also aging. In 1988, 51 percent of the RN workforce was over the age of 40. In 1996 that number had increased to 62 percent. The aver age age of practicing nurses in Georgia is now 45, again greater than the national average age of 44 (Bureau of Health Professions, Division of Nursing, 2000). There is also limited diversity among registered nurses providing health care to Georgians. Eighty-two percent (50,659) of the RNs are Caucasian, 15 per cent (9,141) are African-A merican and 3.5 percent represent other minorities (Georg ia Health Workforce Cooperative, 2002). Hence, the number of minority registered nurses in the state is less than half the percentage of the minority population as a whole. Clearly the need exists for a more diverse workforce to meet the needs of Georgia's citizens. The goal of the NGN project at CCSU is to incr ease the number of minority and disadvantaged students able to enroll in and complete a baccalaureate nursing program . The project has a three-fold approach: Pre-entry preparation for high school juniors and seniors and college freshmen and sophomores; Focused retention efforts for enrolled j unior and senior nursi ng students; and Student stipends to support financ ially disadvantaged students. There are four specific components of the project: The Academic Enhancement Program and the math and science camp for high school students; Academic Enhancement Program fo r pre-nursing university students; Retention efforts for university nursing stude nts through the NGN mentor ing program; and Student stipends awarded for part icipation in the NGN programs. The pre-entry preparation for high school student s includes a summer math and science camp and academic enhancement activities during the school year . Key stakeholders in the high school program were the project counselor who was a liaison with four Clayton County high schools and the project liaison to the Center for Academic Assistance at CCSU. Seventy hi gh school students participated in the camps the first two years of the project and 25 were recruited for summer 2005. The camps were held on campus with collaboration from math a nd science faculty who prepared many hands-on activities for the students including making ice cream. In addition, a CPR course was provided for the students. A cookout was the finale of the camps at which time the students r eceived a certificate of participation and their stipend checks. The NGN academic enhancement program follows the summer camps during the school year. The NGN academic enhancement program consists of collaboration with the Center for Academic Assistance (CAA) at the University, diagnostic testing in mat h, reading comprehension, language, writing, use of SkillsBank 5 (a computer tutoring program) peer tutoring, and study time. The high school students came to the university's CAA. Th e students typically repo rted enjoying being on a university campus and having a quiet place to study. 47 The summer camps had a positive impact on the high school students both academically and socially. The hands-on activities helped the students to master science concepts needed for future careers in health care. Many participating high school students indicated in focus groups that being on a university campus helped them to get an idea of wh at to expect when going to college, and they also thought it would help them make the transi tion from high school to college easier. The impact of the pre-entry preparation for high school students was evident in improved high school progress reports, admission to vari ous universities, and improved SAT post scores. The students' SAT scores ranged from 790 to 1050; CCSU requires sc ores of 400 on the math portion and 430 on the verbal portion. Over half of the students scored high enough on the SAT to be admitted to CCSU. Those who did not score high enough in both the math and verbal sections di d have scores high enough in one category. The scoring and entrance requ irements on the SAT may change with the new SAT format currently being administered. Preparing university pre-nursing students is essentia l in trying to increase the number of minority and disadvantaged students enteri ng the CCSU nursing program. The NGN pre-nursing information sessions are a way to better educat e students about nursing as a career. Members of the Student Nurses Association (SNA) encourage students interested in nursing to join the local chapter that costs $8 and consider state and national membership. Membership in SNA is open to all un iversity students and is not limited only to nursing students. Participatio n in SNA provides networking, information about the nursing program, and socialization into the profession of nursing. Peer tuto ring is available in the Center for Academic Assistance, and SkillsBank 5 is also used for diagnostic testing and tutoring in identified academic areas that need strengthening. The impact of the pre-entry preparation for university students is clear in that it increases participants' understanding of nursing as a career, enhances their a cademic skills to increas e the probability of being admitted to the nursing program, provides socializati on into nursing, and increases their understanding of the rigor of a nursing program. One student in the NGN program w ho was enrolled in the nursing program commented that even though the grant team prepared her for the rigor of the nursing program, it was harder than she expected a nd she was glad to be forewarned. When the project team considered retention effort s for the minority and disadvantaged students in the nursing program, we believed we had to begin with faculty. Prior to beginning this mentoring program, Dr. Ora Strickland, a nationally known sp eaker, provided consultation on developing nursing faculty for the mentor role. She presented two seminars on mentoring, and the faculty evaluations were positive. The NGN mentoring program cons isted of eight faculty (mentors) and 19 students (mentees) during spring, summer, and fall semester s 2003 and nine faculty (mentors) and 33 students (mentees) during spring, summer, and fall seme sters 2004. Both students and faculty received stipends. The NGN mentoring program was designed for the mentor/men tee dyads to meet weekly and agree on common behaviors. For example, each mentee who failed a quiz or test had to notify his/her mentor within one week with a plan for improvement and had to keep a journal of individual progress. The mentors worked with their mentees to develop st udy strategies that were congruent with individual learning styles. Also, the mentors kept a log of w eekly activities. The students (mentees) evaluated the program and shared that it was a significant and meaningful part of their academic achievement as well as their socialization into nursing. The faculty evaluations of the program were also positive, noting mentors received personal satisfaction in the accomplishments of their mentees. The impact of the retention efforts of nursing studen ts was apparent in different ways. The first group of NGN students (mentees) graduated in spring 2004. The project helped all students pass both the ERI National Standardized exit exam required in the nursing program and the National Council of Licensing Examinations (NCLEX) on their first atte mpt. In December 2004, all but one student passed 48 both the exit exam and the NCLEX on the first attempt. The one student who did not pass the exit exam on the first attempt, passed it on the second attempt and had another opportunity to sit for the NCLEX. Additional students still in the nursi ng program are progressing toward graduation, and another group will graduate in spring 2005. Student stipends were provided to eligible high sc hool students, pre-nursing university students, and junior and senior nursing students. They received $250 a month if they attended all activities. Their stipends were decreased if students did not put in the requ ired hours or attend the scheduled activities. Records were kept on all students re ceiving stipends and the amount received. Since the beginning of the project, a total of nine faculty members and a total of 102 high school and university students have received stipends. The impact of the student stipends was threefold: Stipends were a motivating factor in student attendance and participation in the NGN activities; Stipends helped meet financial need s of disadvantaged students; and Stipends helped some students decrease their work hours and spend more time on school work. Participants who received stipe nds acknowledged their appreciation of the funds and many university students used them for continuing school expenses. Students in a focus group indicated that they would participate in the NGN program even if there were no stipends because of the benefits received. Administering the NGN project brought a greate r understanding of minority and disadvantaged students, the need to be able to respond to unexpected events, and th e importance for faculty development and future grant-writing. This project showed that minority and disadvantaged students are capable of enrolling in and successfully completing a nursi ng program and passing the NCLEX exam, leading to a more diverse nursing workforce. The scope of the project was larger than anticipa ted, the planning period took longer than anticipated, and more manpower was needed to implement the projec t activities. The projec t team also learned the importance of team work and the need to be flexible and adapt to une xpected events, such as the delay in getting started because of the inability to hire a project counselor in the time allotted. Faculty development in cultural competence and mentori ng is vital when working with minority and disadvantaged students to assist them in achieving their full potential. A major lesson learned from this project relates to future grant writing and the need to expand the personnel needed to accomplish a large-scale project and include more faculty release time. The project team had several recommendations for successful recruitment and retention strategies aimed at minority and disadvantaged students. To enhance the pool of mi nority and disadvantaged students, education about nursing and other health care fields must begin in elementary, middle, and high school. Pre-nursing academic enhancement programs will help these students be competitive in the admission process to nursing programs. Faculty in schools of nursing need to demonstrate a passion for interacting with minority and disadvantaged students, including a willingness to take the extra time needed to work with these students. In addition, faculty development in cultural competence and mentoring provides the underpinnings for faculty to best enhance the academic performance of this population. Mentoring is an excellent method to enhance the success rate of minority and disadvantaged students in nursing programs. Another impo rtant aspect of retaining this population of students, once they are enrolled in nursing programs, is to implement a tracking system to monitor their achievements and plan appropr iate interventions if they encounter academic difficulties. 49 This project has helped minority and disadvantaged students successful ly enroll in and complete a baccalaureate program in nursing, thereby contributing to HRSA's goal of incr easing the diversity of the nursing workforce. As such, HRSA should conti nue to provide funding for the Nursing Workforce Diversity Program. This project was supported by funds from the Division of Nursing (DN), Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr), Health Resources and Services Administ ration (HRSA), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) under grant number 5D19HP40434-02 and title, Preparing the Next Generation of Nurses, for $890,000 over three years.

Pathways into Nursing Linda Speranza, PhD, ARNP-C, MS, MEd Director, Pathways Into Nursing Diane Reed, PhD(c), MBA, BSN Retention Specialist, Pathways Into Nursing Valencia Community College, Orlando, Florida Summary Dr. Linda Speranza introduced the Pathways into Nursing (PIN) project on the four campuses at Valencia Community College in Or lando, Florida. Orlando is a larg e city with a growing population of more than one million. The college president is very supportive of the PIN project. The award- winning program has established partnerships with three high schools. The program focuses on increasing representation of Hispanics, African Americans, and American Indians in colleges. Students in grades 10-12 were select ed as PIN targets; criteria in cluded grade point average (GPA), interviews (two with teachers or counselors), a writing sample, and college placement tests. Despite the predictions of lower numbers by Valencia's advi sory council and an initial goal of 15, there were more than 100 applicants during the first year. Fift y-three applicants were selected in the inaugural year; seventy-four were admitted the second year and 108 in the third year. The ethnic mix of Hispanic, Asian, disadvantaged Caucasian, and African-American stude nts has been stable over the three years. Several males are enrolled in the program; currently six men are participating. Advertisements in local Spanish and English newspapers are used as a recruiting tool. The core team consists of two full-time staff, three part-time educators, a nd two registered nurses (RNs). One RN is a clinical nurse specialist. The second RN is a ba ccalaureate-prepared nurse who is currently teaching at the same hi gh school from which she graduated. There is also a physician from Venezuela on the team. Faculty and staff are encour aged to participate in a Hispanic Month and an African American Month. One-to-one mentoring is provided by the part-time educators. The college has a tutoring center with instructors st rong in math and English (bilingual). PIN students have excelled in College Placemen t Tests (CPT), reducing the need for college remediation courses, and current Valencia nursing students have bridged the gap through mentoring as PIN Pals. Nursing scholarships have allowed st udents to concentrate on grades, maintaining high GPAs. Many of the PIN students volunteer their time in local nursing homes and other health facilities because they have nurse's aid experience. 52 Pathways into Nursing Linda Speranza, PhD, ARNP-C, MS, MEd Director, Pathways Into Nursing Diane Reed, PhD(c), MBA, BSN Retention Specialist, Pathways Into Nursing Valencia Community College, Orlando, Florida Pathways Into Nursing (PIN) is a Health Reso urces and Services Administration (HRSA) grant awarded to Valencia Community College in Orlando, Florida from July 2002 to June 2005. Valencia Community College serves over 54,0 00 students annually from the Ora nge and Osceola counties in the service area of central Florida. The Valencia Community College Nursing Program started in 1974 and has traditionally accepted 168 nursing students per year. In view of the nati onal nursing shortage, PIN has been an important contributor to building Valencia's nursing student enrollment up to the current status of admitting 350 nursing students per year. In addition to meeti ng demands for nurses in the Central Florida area, Valencia has increased its service range from one to two campuses fo r nursing and other health-related programs. Valencia currently has four major cam puses: three in Orange County and one in Osceola County. Valencia's Osceola Campus, the primary locat ion for PIN, is a Federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution. This enables students from the partner high schools to remain in their communities after becoming registered nurses (RNs) so as to provide culturally competent care to diverse individuals in previously underser ved areas. The nursing program has increased from two to three admissions per year to meet growth needs. The Va lencia Nursing Program is very proud of its success rate, clearly demonstrated by an average 92-94 percent pass rate on the NCLEX. The State of Florida has a mean pass rate of 78 percent. The PIN grant was designed to increase recruitm ent and retention of disadvantaged minority nursing students, particularly those who are Hispanic, by providing pre-entry pr eparation and retention activities for high school and colleg e students who have the potential and desire to become RNs. Valencia's Associate Degree in Nu rsing (ADN) program provides an opportunity to become an RN for many minority and low-income students including firs t-time-in-college students who cannot afford to attend or cannot meet the entrance requirements of a four-year university. Valencia and the PIN grant assesses each student's academic level and provides remediation wher e required. Valencia encourages its ADN students to further their nursing education by earning a Baccalaureate or Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), an RN to Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), or BSN to MSN to Doctorate of Nursing (PhD). In Healthy People 2010, focus area 1-8 states that th e proportions of all health professional degrees, including nursing, awarded to members of underrep resented racial and ethnic groups, must be increased. Baseline data showed th at in 1995-96, only 3.4 percent of i ndividuals in the skilled health professions were of Hispanic orig in. Healthy People 2010's goal is to increase this to 12 percent. The PIN grant, through pre-entry and retention activitie s and by targeting diverse, disadvantaged high schools with a high Hispanic population, has already ex ceeded this goal. As the end of the third and final year of the grant, there has consistently been rete ntion of over 50 percent Hispanic students, 15- 53 18 percent Asian students, 11-15 pe rcent African American students and 11-15 percent disadvantaged Caucasian students. All of this growth is essent ial to meet the increasing needs of the Orange and Osceola counties in the service area of central Florida which, at 54 percent growth and 102 percent growth respectively, far surpass the state growth projection of 37 percen t over the next 10 years (Figure 1). At the onset of th e grant, the Hispanic population wa s underrepresented in Valencia's nursing program as it was, and still is, nationally. This grant has in creased the numbers of ethnically diverse, disadvantaged students at Valencia in Ce ntral Florida and has provided one possible solution for the nursing shortage locall y, statewide, and nationally.

A benefit of the partnership is automatic entrance into Valencia's Nursing Program once all of the prerequisite courses are completed according to nursing program specifications. The first high school, Cypress Creek High School (CCHS) locat ed in Orange County, has a majority non- affluent Hispanic population. In the first year of the grant, th ere were over 5,000 students at CCHS. In the second year, that high school 's enrollment dropped to slightly over 3,200 students, and that figure remains stable today. The initial size of CCHS warranted a new school to serve the needs of the co mmunity. Therefore, a new high school was built and zoned for approximately one half of the CCHS student pop ulation. PIN students at CCHS were given the choice to migrate to the new school without the PIN pr ogram or stay with PIN at CCHS. The decision by some students to move to the new high school, which is not part of the PIN high school partnership, resulted in the major reason for attrition the after the fi rst year of the grant. The remaining two partners, Gateway High School (GHS) and Osceola High School (OHS) are located in Osceola County. GHS students come from a large, non-affluent diverse population comprised of predominantly Hispanic ethnicity. OHS students are non-affluent and diverse with a variety of ethnic groups, especially Hispanic. Partnerships were also formed with local hospita ls in the high school's service area. Osceola Regional Medical Center and Celebration Health in the Florida Hospital Adventist Health Care System were motivated to work with PIN so as to provide the \"staff of tomorrow.\" These hospitals wanted to give opportuni ties to PIN students because th ey recognized the benefit of providing positive experiences that would encourage them to come back to work in their own communities as RNs. College programs also formed partnerships with the PIN program to assist the students with the post-secondary transition. The fo llowing college programs have serv ed key roles in facilitating the transition from high school to college for the PIN students: \u0083 Students In Industry; \u0083 Internship and Placement; \u0083 Recruitment and Retention of Ethnically Diverse Students; \u0083 Valencia Community College Nursing Program; \u0083 Services; and \u0083 Financial Aid. Some of the enrichment programs and products developed in conjunction with the above listed programs include: Field trips to partnership hosp itals and Valencia Community Co llege for career investigations; 57 Summer Externship Health Mentorship Program; \"pinning\" ceremony; Brochures, Posters, Certificates, Graphics, and PIN logos; Development of Medical Academy at OHS and CCHS; Utilization of SimMan, computerized health care mannequin, with the Nursing Arts Lab at Valencia Community College's Osceola Campus; Effective utilization of Dual Enrollment (DE) to provide cost effective ed ucation en route to the RN degree; Use of Waiver for Valencia Community College admission fee for DE students; Assistance with completion of mandatory college applications; Career resources for Nursing and personality testing; and Scholarships provided for quali fied PIN students through Brid ges, Health Resources and Services Administration, and private organizations. High School Data Applicants The applicants are ethnically diverse Hispanic, Asian, African-American, and disadvantaged Caucasian students in grades 10-12. It was origina lly thought that the grant would educate 60 students over the three year period. The grant specified that 15 students would be admitted to the PIN project in the first year; 20 would be admitted in the second year ; and 25 would be educated the third year. Over the three years of the grant, Vale ncia has facilita ted the PIN experience for 130 students from the three high schools. Selection Criteria Although the high schools believed that the majority of the students would have grade point averages (GPAs) of 2.0 to 2.9, a large portion of the applicants for Pathways Into Nursing had achieved GPAs over 3.0. Other criteria included a PIN application packet with a variety of admission requirements including the College Placement Test (CPT). College Placement Test (CPT) The College Placement Test (CPT), developed by The College Board, assesses levels of skill accomplishment in reading, English, and mathematics. Passing scores on the CPT permit high school students to take college courses while attending high school (via dual enrollment [DE]). CPT scores from the entering and graduating PIN students were ut ilized to demonstrate research-based outcomes. Research targeted these ethnically diverse and disadvantaged pre-nursing high school students to decrease their need for college remediation course s. PIN prepares and re tains pre-nursing students by utilizing CPT test scores as an indicator for dual enrollment eligibility. Substandard CPT scores warrant remediation, delaying colleg e entrance. The goal was to be successful in passing the CPT therefore providing the foundation skills to pursue va rious career options as a registered nurse. 58 PIN students completed the CPT and were enrolled in health science courses in grades 10-12 in the three partnership high schools. Scores of 90 in English, 84 in reading, and 84 in mathematics were required in order to avoid remedial courses in college. Ninety-three students were given structured CPT tutoring for a duration of one semester to tw o years. The CPT was retaken to see if students qualified for dual enrollment prior to becoming colle ge freshmen. A mean was obtained of English, reading, and mathematics scores upon entrance, and again after tutoring. The results for the 93 entering PIN students were as follows: The average CPT score for English was 79, reading was 69 and mathematics was 53. After tuto ring, the average score for English increased to 90, reading increased to 81 and mathematics increased to 71. This reflects a notable increase in mean student CPT scores and therefor e a reduction in the need for re mediation courses prior to dual enrollment and/or courses ta ken as a college student. Demographics Ethnicity The ethnicity of the current PIN st udent population is as follows: Hispanic: 50 percent Asian: 18 percent Disadvantaged Caucasian: 17 percent African-American: 14 percent All of the PIN partnership high schools are considered \"disadvantaged.\" Gender Currently, there are a total of six male students in the PIN program. High School Distribution Currently, the distribution for the PIN program is differentia ted between high sc hool, pre-nursing at Valencia Community College, and the Valencia Nursing Program. There are a total of 103 PIN students in the entire PIN program with 71 of thes e students in high school, 28 in pre-nursing courses at Valencia, and four in the Vale ncia Nursing Program. The Valenc ia pre-nursing and nursing students are referred to as the \"VCC/PIN.\" The PIN students are progressing so that there is an increase in admissions into the Nursing Program every semest er. For example, there were two PIN student admissions into the Nursing Program in fall 2004. In spring 2005 there were also two PIN student admissions. However, as more students complete prerequisite courses th rough dual enrollment while in high school, they have shortened the time for entr ance into the Valencia Nursing Program. As a result, there were seven VCC/ PIN students entering the Valencia Nursing Program in fall 2005. Pathways Design Core Team The PIN Core Team is diverse and consists of th e Director, Retention Speci alist, three high school Educators, and a grant staff assistant. The Core Team's ethnic background includes two Hispanic, one African-American and three Caucasian individuals. The Director and Rete ntion Specialist have worked in full-time capacities during the three years of the grant. The grant staff assistant was employed in a 20- to 32-hour position until the past six months in which she was employed full time to 59 meet the increasing demands of the grant. The PIN Educators have been em ployed as part-time staff (20 hour per week) and spend a major portion of thei r time in the three partnership high schools. Although all are cross-trained, each has been given specific responsibilities: Parent Coordinator; Enrichment and Web Site Development Coordinator; and Incentive, Fundraiser, and Team Leader Coordinator. Diversity The learning needs of the students, staff, and the community, including diversity, have been part of this grant. One objective of the grant has been to ach ieve a culturally competent and sensitive nursing workforce through bi-annual college and high school f aculty and staff training. Activities included conducting \"Diversity Works!\" and ot her cultural diversity workshops twice a year for grant staff. Other activities included cu ltural exchange luncheons, endorsement of community events sensitive to the needs of diverse ethnic groups , and linkages to national ethnically diverse holidays such as Black History Month and Hispanic Aware ness Month. All activities serv e to enhance th e richness of diversity through shared experiences with staff, students, and the community. Mentoring Student mentoring was conducted at three different levels. The first mentoring level consisted of one- to-one mentoring for each of the PIN students by th e educator at their high school. At the second level, the \"Course Progression (CP)\" form was developed to assist with ment oring the transitioning PIN high school students into Valencia. The CP provided the Retention Sp ecialist and the VCC/PIN students with a quick reference for knowing the exact status in relation to grades, degree completion status, and courses taken. Once students graduated from high school and attended pre-nursing courses at Valencia, mentoring continued by the Retention Specialist. The third level consisted of students who entered the nursing program. At this level, mentoring was enha nced by the Florida Student Nurse Association (FNSA) and the Natio nal Student Nurse Association (N SNA) award-winning \"PIN Pals Mentorship Program.\" PIN Core Team mentoring was also done throughout the three years of the grant. This included: enhancing computer skills, web design, design of new courses and revision of existing courses, formulating and executing personal development pl ans, expanding global unde rstanding of cultural sensitivity and diversity, personal growth related to teaching skills, and development of community resources for future employment opportunities. Tutoring Tutors were budgeted for Year 2 of the grant which improved the outcomes of the previously discussed CPT scores. Tutors were also used to assist high school students with improving grades in all academic areas. An unexpected positive outcome was that eventually VCC/PIN students became tutors for high school PIN students. Open Houses Open Houses were conducted annua lly prior to the beginning of the high school year. Announced in both Spanish and English local newspapers, Open Houses invited prospective students and their families to each of the partnership high schools. Pa rents were receptive to the invitation to learn more about the RN program at Valencia. Many parents queried about becoming an RN themselves, as a career change. The PIN staff bilingually assisted the students as well as the parents in career information. As a result of this close relationship with parents, one mother with an Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN), has recently completed her Bachelor of Science in Nursing and enrolled in a Master 60 of Science in Nursing (MSN) program. She plans to graduate with her MSN at the same time her daughter, in the PIN program, will complete her ADN at Valencia. The PI N turnout at some high schools was more than 100 parents and students which greatly outnumbe red the number of attendees to a general open house for the entire high school held another evening. Pathways Into Nursing Accomplishments The following PIN accomplishments have been recognized throughout the past three years: PIN Pals Mentorship Program - Current PIN Nursing students are PIN Pals for the fall 2005 PIN students entering the Nursing Program. High School Medical Academies - One high school started with a health academy and the PIN grant helped to develop academies in th e other two partnership high schools. Measurable College Placement Test (CPT) Outcomes - PIN students took fewer remedial courses than the typical community college student because of tutoring. Bridges and $40K HRSA Scholarships - The majority of graduating PIN students were awarded Bridges Scholarships (Valencia Commun ity College two-year scholarship). In addition, HRSA awarded $40K for qualified PIN students for Valencia Community College courses. Summer Externship Health Exploration - This program provided life experiences critical to the PIN student's choice of becoming a registered nurse. National Award Winning Program: Summer Ex ternship Health Exploration (SEHE) PIN students were allowed to shadow RNs in nu merous departments within both Osceola Regional Medical Center and Florida Hospital Celebratio n Health Hospital. SEHE was a summer dual enrollment (DE) course that lasted one month. In addition to the rotations in various hospital departments, leadership activities augmented stud ent professional development. The students were enriched by guest presenters. This innovative month-long DE course pr ovided a sense of reality about nursing which encouraged students to work harder to ward becoming successful registered nurses. Challenges throughout the Past Three Years Several challenges surfaced duri ng the three year PIN grant: Cultural - There were citizenship issues related to students submitting proper credentials for college admission. Partnerships - High school administration had to be informed or enlightened about current quality educational rete ntion paradigms that were innovati ve as well as goal-directed. Unexpected - Findings were consistent with overall national high school concerns related to students transitioning from secondary and post-secondary education. Lessons Learned Through the Pathways Into Nursing Grant Lessons learned through the PIN grant program included: PIN students have excelled in improving CPT sc ores, reducing the need for college remediation courses. Valencia nursing students have bridged the gap through mentoring as PIN Pals. 61 Nursing scholarships have allowed students to concentrate on grades, thus maintaining high GPAs. Parents have moved to the zoned sc hool district so that their st udents could have the opportunity to apply and be a part of the PIN program. Legislation is needed that will in crease funding to nursing programs. Nursing scholarships and summe r externships must continue. Innovative paradigms should be adopted to educate nurses who will meet the increasing health care needs of the expanding population. Summary PIN more than met the goals established in the grant proposal. PIN is a wonderfully innovative teamwork paradi gm that should be recognized to bridge the levels of nursing, providing the individual with the necessary tools to climb the \"career pathway.\" The PIN Program provides one possible soluti on for the nursing shortage by supporting the creation of culturally sensitive and culturally compet ent health care to diverse individuals from members of their own communities. 62 3.4. Success Pathways: Introducing Nursing as a Career Option Dr. DeLois P. Weekes Summary Dr. Weekes (a new NACNEP appoi ntee who began work on the National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice (NACNEP) in November 2005) described Springfield, Missouri as in the Southwest corner of the State, in the Ozarks. It has a typical Ozark culture: 300,000 people, five educational institutions, and two major regional medical centers. There is a general North-South divide of race and income in the school system; the schools that the Succe ss Pathways Into Nursing (SPIN) program partners with are in the North. The program initially started working in elementary, middle, and high schools. There was an initial outc ry from families of Caucasian students asking why their children were not getting the same resources as the students of color. The program responded by trying to make the program co-curricular rather than extracurricular. The partnering high school agreed to co-curricular status , but the middle school did not. The Cox Nursing Encounter Camps (C-NEC) were held for two weeks each summer of the project. The curriculum included shadowing registered nurses, learning basic nursing skills, mathematics, science, reading, critical thinking and self-efficacy activ ities, developing self -confidence, and team building. The Retention Mentoring Program (RMP) al so assigned faculty mentors to each participant upon admission to Cox College and monitored participan ts through the first writing of their registered nurse (RN) licensure examination by the faculty ment ors. Extensive efforts were carried out seeking community support for the project. Among the challenges were finding nurses of color to be project staff, re-orienting staff each year, timing session meetings, dealing with school offi cials and politicians, recruiting appropriate consultants, and overcoming parental wariness. Future plans includ e quarterly newsletters, college workshops, continued C-NECs, and a project conference in August 2005. Presentation Success Pathways: Introducing Nursing as a Career Option The purpose of this presentation is to describe an ongoing Federally funded project entitled \"Success Pathways Into Nursing (SPIN) Project.\" This project was designed to recruit and retain underrepresented minorities (URM) into nursing. The project focused on elementary, middle, and high school students as well as URM students who are currently enrolled in Asso ciate or Bachelor of Science Programs in Nursing. A variety of met hods were used to engage and interest the youth including educational sessions, college workshops , tutoring, mentoring, receptions, summer camps, camp alumni dinners, and field trips to the College for hands-on experiences that enable youth to learn basic nursing skills. A variety of data were colle cted and used to assess the effectiveness of specific strategies/activities and the project as a whole. A major portion of this presentation concerne d the challenges faced and lessons learned in the process of implementing this proj ect. Specific suggestions for anticipating and managing obstacles and capitalizing on opportun ities were discussed. Dialogue included implementation of the registered nurse (RN) Workforce Diversity Project in environments that encompass small numbers of minoriti es in their populations. The obj ectives of the presentation were to: 63 Describe the Success Pathways In to Nursing (SPIN) Project; Identify the challenges faced and the lessons l earned in implementing a project directed at recruitment and retention of underrepresented mi norities (URM) into nursing in a city and college that is predominantly European American; and Discuss the future plans and activities of the SPIN Project. 64 Success Pathways: Introducing Nursing as a Career Option Dr. DeLois P. Weekes Introduction The Success Pathways Into Nursing (SPIN) Project was a three-year grant (July 1, 2002 through July 1, 2005) funded by the U.S. Department of Health a nd Human Services, Bureau of Health Professions, Division of Nursing. The purpose of the SPIN Project was to contribute to increasing the number of registered nurses from underrepresented minorit y (URM) groups available to deliver culturally competent healthcare to an increasingly diverse population. The SPIN Project was implemented as an extra-curri cular activity targeted at all URM students at Central High School (grades 9-12) and Parkview High School (grades 9-12). At Pipkin Middle School (grades 6-8) and Boyd Elementary School (5th grade), the project was implemented as a co-curricular activity. These schools, located in North Springfield, had the highest percentage of the URM secondary school student population in the Spring field community and were located in the only Medically Underserved Area (MUA) in Gr eene County, adjacent to Cox College. Other program components associat ed with the SPIN project were the Retention Mentoring Program (RMP), Cultural Competence Week, and the Cox Nu rsing Encounter Camp (C-NEC). The Retention Mentoring component was developed for Cox Colle ge URM students in orde r to facilitate their academic success by offering workshops, scholarships, and mentors. Cultural Competence Week was held annually in February. During the students' visit, workshops, seminars, colloquiums, and luncheons were held. These were planned in consultation with the program director, program staff, and members of the Cox College faculty and staff. These forums served as venues for discussion of historic and contemporary issues in cultural comp etence and cultural inclusi on, and were open to all internal and external constituents of Cox College. In addition, a nationally known cultural competence expert served as a visiting professor on the cam pus of Cox College and helped to develop and implement the workshops The Cox Nursing Encounter Camp was a two-week camp held in 2001-2003 for high school students from URM backgrounds residing in Greene County. The first week of the camp was held at the YMCA's Camp Wakonda where partic ipants learned critic al thinking skills, teamwork skills, and social skills. During the second week participants shadowed registered nurses at Cox South Medical Center. The goals of the SPIN Project focused on exposure of the target population to health care careers, specifically nursing. This was achie ved through the use of modalities su ch as videos and interactive, hands-on weekly meetings. Participant knowledge of and interest in nursing was assessed using a pre- test, the Nursing Knowledge Interest Survey (NKIS), administered to project participants during the first meeting. The NKIS was also used as a post-te st to track changes in k nowledge and interest in nursing after the informational a nd hands-on sessions and videos. The most significant challenge to the accomplishment of the project goals and objectives occurred in Year 3. After a careful assessment of the support required at the mi ddle school to assure achievement of the project objectives, it was de termined that changing the middle school participant was necessary. For the first two years of th e project (2002 - 2004), Pipkin Middl e School only allowed the SPIN project as an extra-curricular activity, and not dur ing instructional time. This was a barrier to achievement of project goals. After multiple meetings with the Principal of Pipkin Middle School, it 65 became clear that the school's administration was not going to relent. Therefore, an alternative school, Parkview High School, was added, with a prior agreem ent that sessions would be during instructional time. Despite the inevitable disruption accompanying su ch a change, project staff were able to build the relationships and the support at the new project school necessary to enable implementation of the project and achievement of the proj ect activities, a tribute to the e xpertise and professionalism of the project staff. Conducting meetings during instructi onal hours versus after school re sulted in increased numbers of participants at Central High School where senior graduating students were likely to matriculate into Cox College and the Retention Mentoring Program. Another reason Parkview High School was added was to reach out to increased numbers of high school juniors and seniors with an interest in nursing who might become prospective student s for Cox College Nursing Programs. Throughout the SPIN Project there we re many activities, seminars, and sessions held to reach the objectives and goals. This final report is a su mmary of the accomplishments, obstacles, and events comprising the SPIN Project. Objective 1: Contribute to the eliminati on of health disparities am ong segments of the population through development of a pipeline of ethnically/racially diverse elem entary, middle, and high school students who will become prospective applicants to Associate of Science/Bachelor of Science nursing programs. Accomplishments Related to Objective 1: Annually, public schools in Springfield begin in August which necessita ted pushing SPIN sessions back to a September start date ve rsus the August date initially identified for start-up. The September start-up afforded teachers and students time to settle into the new school year. In accordance with the sub-objectives, eight sessions were held twice per month and last ed 45 to 60 minutes. Sessions were held during instructional time at Boyd Elementary, which is multi-ethnic/racial, enabling the entire fifth grade cl ass to participate in activities and be exposed to nursing. The concession to include the entire class was made to mitigate acrimony and alienation of school officials and parents. The SPIN sessions exposed participants to info rmation about nursing thr ough interactive sessions, videos, and hands-on activities. During Year One, three hands-on se ssions were held in the Cox College Skills Laboratory. Under the direct superv ision of Cox College faculty and SPIN Faculty Mentors, participants learned psyc homotor skills such as how to ta ke apical and radial pulses and blood pressure; they also participated in a mobility lab. Each project year, attendance at all schools was within the target s set for the project (see Figure 1). Participants demonstrated high le vels of engagement and particip ation in session activities. The highlight of the project for all participants contin ued to be the field trips to the Cox College Skills Laboratory to learn basic nursing skills. 66 Figure 1: Number of Particip ants in the SPIN Project Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Boyd Elementary 43 34 21 Pipkin Middle School 16 11 --- Central High School 20 44 59 Parkview High School --- --- 17 Factors Contributing to Performance and Achievement of Objective 1: Student exposure to role models . This exposure was accomplished in three ways: project staff; informational videos; and register ed nurse (RN) mentors who were also URMs. These positive role models ranged from the Presid ent of Cox College to nursing students to support staff. Selected SPIN Project experiences . The Cox College Skills Lab was utilized for both Pipkin Middle School and Central High School SPIN Proj ect participants. This experience enabled participants to learn basic psychom otor (i.e., blood pressure, pulse, respiration, apical pulse, and crutch walking) skills. Participants were taugh t basic computer skills in the college computer lab. Through the hands-on activities, the students gain ed increased knowledge and understanding of what nurses do, in a \"cool\" way. An added benefit was the opportunity for participants to meet and inter act with current nursing students in a college setting. Project participants looked forward to part icipating in this popular activity Summer camp experience . This was a tuition-free, two-week summer experience with an overarching objective to promote teamwork and critical thinking, and improve mathematics, science, and reading skills. The first week was a \"fun\" expe rience during which the high school students stayed overnight at a local summer camp. The second week allowed the participants to shadow registered nurses in the clinical setti ng. The summer camp was a recruitment and retention tool for the Senior High SPIN Project at Springfield Central which saw a 44 percent retention rate from Y ear One to Year Two. Barriers to Achievement of Objective 1: Time, space, and schedule at Pipkin Middle School . The educationally focused Junior High SPIN Project competed for students' time w ith popular extra-curri cular activities (e.g., basketball, track, and cheerleadin g). As a result, conversations were held with the Pipkin administration in an attempt to change the Ju nior High SPIN Club to a co-curricular activity imbedded into the instructional day and to acquire dedicated meeting space. They were not receptive to the requested changes in spite of the financial stipends from Cox College and the support from the Springfield School District Central Office. The d ecline in partic ipation of the Junior High SPIN Club was directly related to the lack of administrative support at the middle school that would enable the Junior High SPIN Club to functi on as a co-curricular activity. Loss of Federal financial support. Cox College was not selected to receive additional funding beyond the current grant time frame. The organizati on, at this time, is in the planning stages for sustaining the SPIN Project wit hout Federal funding. Conversa tions have been held with Central High School Counselors to determine the f easibility of continuance of the field trips to the Cox College Nursing Resource Center Skills Laboratory. Time and schedule at Central High School . In Year One, Senior High SPIN Club meetings began at 7:30 am, which seriously limited participation. As a re sult, conversations were held 67 with the principal and guidance counselors and it was agreed to move the meeting into the instructional day. As a result of this change, part icipation increased by 50 percent in Year Two. Objective 2: Development and implementation of a Re tention/Mentoring Program (RMP) for pre- matriculated (pre-nursing) and matr iculated Cox College students. Accomplishments Related to Objective 2: The Retention/Mentoring Program (RMP) was desi gned for pre-nursing and nursing students enrolled at Cox College. The purpose of the meetings was to introduce the Retention Mentoring Program and identify interested URM students admitted to the colle ge and enrolled in general education classes as well as students admitted to the Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) and Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Programs. Sessions with the RMP participants were held monthly. The largest attendance each year occurred during the \"Final Fi nale Study Session\" where tutors and staff were available to assist students with preparation and study for final examinations. Marketing techniques for recruitment and retention into the RMP were developed in anticipation of capturing a larger audience and increasing participation. The numbe r of underrepresented minorities enrolled at Cox College increased from three (fal l 2002, beginning of SPIN) to 21 (s pring 2005, near the end of SPIN), with 7 of them in the BSN program and 14 in the ASN program. Another adve rtising tactic for RMP and the SPIN Project was that the counselors were Cox College students who had declared nursing as their major. In addition, the SPIN Project Coordinator worked closely with faculty teaching the Promoting Learning and Ultimate Success (PLUS) course. As a result, initial contact with students of color occurred during their first semester on campus whic h facilitated recruitment into the RMP Program. The PLUS course was required for all first time Cox College students and was de signed to facilitate a successful college experience by offering strategies to improve and build strong classroom skills, study techniques, test taking, critical thinking, and time management skills. Introduction of the RMP during this class ensured that every URM had information on RMP. The evaluation data for this objective demonstrated the effectiveness of proj ect activities in building and maintaining interest in nursing as a profession for URM. The finite number of participants was small which appears to be an artifact of two factors. Firs t, the Springfield community is approximately 95 percent Caucasian. Thus, the potential pool of URM secondary school students was small. Second, the term of the project was sufficient to provide a firm foundation for increa sing URM participation in nursing but not sufficient to allow th e time to move to the next level of integration an d incorporation necessary to institutionalize the pr oject in the secondary schools. So, the number of URM students now entering the College must be understood in its historical and dem ographic contexts and appreciated not for its size but for its clear indication of project success. Reports from URM members of the Cox College Community Advisory Council helped to provide additional understanding in a hist orical context. Specifically, th e URM members of the Community Advisory Council further indicates that SPIN has had a significant impact on the Springfield community in the following ways: The project opened a vista for UR M students to consider nursing as a career option, an option they never previously considered possible; Cox College is now perceived as a place that welcomes and encourages students from URM groups to pursue health careers, especially nursing; and 68 Greater numbers of community members now understand that Cox College makes available academic and financial support services that en able students from URM groups to pursue college degrees and care ers in health care. Factors Contributing to Performance and Achievement of Objective 2: Overcoming the history of Cox College admissions . From the establishment of Burge School of Nursing in 1907 (which became Cox Colle ge in 1995) until 2001, there were only 10 graduates from URM backgrounds. High visibility of the current President of Cox College . Dr. Weekes has provided the vision, leadership, and administrative s upport to facilitate the success of the SPIN Project. Her position in the community as a promin ent African-American woman in a chief executive position has placed her in a unique and visible role. Dr. We ekes has been the driving force behind the creation of the SPIN Project consistent with the vision for the future of Cox College. Recruitment and retention of students from URM backgrounds at Cox College . The faculty and administration acknowledged the need to increase the number of students from URM backgrounds in nursing programs at Cox Co llege in Springfield. The creation of an academic and community environment at Cox College has facilitated retention of students from URM backgrounds. The faculty and administra tion have integrated the Johnson & Johnson technical assistance and advice from other expert s into the milieu of the academic institution. Other strategies implemented incl ude provision of diversity publica tions in the college library, a new emphasis on URM students in marketing tools, and the utilization of on-site publicity materials (billboards, presentations). All strategi es have a priority focus to attract students from URM groups to Cox College. Community-based activities . Cox College has made a concerte d effort to maintain visibility within the URM communities. Members of the college community participated in activities such as: middle and high school functions (inc luding graduations); Natio nal Association for the Advancement of Colored People meetings; faith -based presentations; speaker activities at community events; volunteering at homeless shelters; a Juneteenth celebration; and Missouri Black Caucus health care edu cation activities. These comb ined efforts have clearly demonstrated the interface of the college w ith the community. Through these aggressive marketing efforts, Cox College has been able to recruit new students from URM backgrounds who otherwise may not have been reached. Barriers to Achievement of Objective 2: Overcome the history of Cox College . Faculty and administration have worked hard to overcome the image of Cox College as a \"white \" school with walls impermeable to groups of color. The time and energy to change this im age has been a point of focus for the current leadership. This impetus to change has had to co me from the inside so that Cox College could be perceived as a welcoming environment for students from URM backgrounds. These efforts are ongoing as the College continues to stri ve to change the image of its past. Demographics . The URM population of the eight count ies is 5.1 percent. This limits the opportunities to expand the pool of potential candidates without going outside the Greater Springfield area. Before 2001, Cox College did not advertise, market, or recruit outside of the commuting area. Since her arrival, Dr. Weekes has expanded the scope of the college's efforts to include urban, metropolitan areas in Missouri, and surrounding states. 69 Promotional materials . Prior to 2001, Cox College materi als did not depict any URM students in their marketing or promotional materials. Th is has changed but the older image lingers in the area's consciousness. Cox College has also be gun to utilize updated marketing efforts (web- based, internet technologies) as part of primary outreach and recruitment efforts. Objective 3: Incorporate cultural competence throughout curricula in nursing programs at Cox College and develop a cadre of culturally competent RMP faculty mentors, RN, SPIN Club, and C-NEC Mentors for the project. Accomplishments Related to Objective 3: Cultural Competence Week was held annually every February. The first Cultural Competence Expert (CCE), Dr. Joyce Newman Giger, spent a week on the Cox College campus during February 17-21, 2003. She conducted an eight-hour cultural competen ce workshop inclusive of interactive components to facilitate preparati on of faculty and project personnel to wo rk with racially/ethnically diverse students. Workshop invitees included Boyd Elem entary School, Pipkin Middl e School, and Central High School principals and counsel ors, Directors of Nursing, the Chief Nursing Officer and Vice President, and the Director of Recruitment and Retention for Nursing in the Cox Health System, among others. Participants took a pre- and post-work shop test on cultural competency. Participants also took a pre- and post-workshop test during the workshop to measure knowledge of cultural competence. Dr. Marjorie Kagawa-Singer, the second Diversity Cultural Competence expe rt, spent a week on the Cox College campus during February 16-20, 2004. While on campus, she provided consultation regarding curriculum to the SPIN Pr oject and to Cox College faculty, visited classrooms, and held a colloquium for Cox College students where she discu ssed specific nursing issu es. While visiting Cox College, she presented workshops on issues about cu ltural competence and end of life which has been an interest of the Missouri Nurses Association (MONA) for the past two years. She also gave a presentation to the Mid-America Cancer Center. Dr. Guadalupe Palos, the third Diversity Cultura l Competence expert, spen t February 21-25, 2005 at Cox College. She provided consultation and training in the areas of conflict resolution, team-building across racial/ethnic boundaries, cons ensus-building in a diverse environment for staff, faculty, RN Mentors, and students enrolled in Cox College. She also reviewed pr int/visual materials including the web site, to identify strengths and weakness related to cultural competence. She met with the curriculum team to discuss strategies to facilitate the integration of cultural competence into the overall nursing curriculum. The interest in cultural competence has risen at Cox College in the past two years due to the SPIN Project, and the call for information has been over whelming. Astute management of the project budget allowed for an additional visit by a consultant in cultural competence during Year 3. This allowed for additional student, faculty, and staff education an d provided another resource to the Springfield community on culturally competent care. Dr. Carla Serlin-King, the fourth and final cultural competency e xpert, visited Cox College during October 18-22, 2004. As well as being a visiting prof essor at Cox College, she presented cultural competence issues to the Missouri Nurses Asso ciation (MONA). During her visit she met with underrepresented minority students to address cultura l issues at Cox College. She also gave a presentation at the Forest Institu te of Professional Psychology enti tled \"Cultural Competence: Policy Perspectives Relevant to Contemporary Me ntal Health in a Multicultural Society.\" 70 Factors Contributing to Performance and Achievement of Objective 3: The design of cultural competence week . Visiting URM professors wi th expertise in the field of cultural and ethnic competency were invited to come to the Cox College campus for a week. The faculty integrated the visiting experts into the classroom where the focus was on achievement of specific course objectives rela ted to cultural competence. The classroom experience was followed by the st udents' participation in comm unity-wide workshops where the focus was on the broader concept of cultural competence as well as skill development. The ultimate impact has been the fostering of self -awareness and increasing the understanding of the need to include cultural competence in the curriculum by Cox College students. Expanding the concept of cultural competency . The conceptual understanding of culture and ethnicity has been broadened by the presence of visiting URM professors on campus to expand the definition beyond race and ethnicity. The me mbers of the Cox College community believe that growth and cultural competence is an ongoing process rather than a single event. This emphasis on cultural competence in the curricul um and the college environment will be a sustained endeavor. Expansion of cultural competency has been accomplished through incorporation of cultural competency and cultural inclusion in the C ox College nursing curriculum. The number of courses that have integrated cultural competency increa sed between academic years 2000-2001 to 2004-2005. The chart below shows this increase. Incorporation of Cultural Comptency in Cox College Curriculum 1129 Courses *RN-BSN track only ++BSN Entry-level track and BSN Accelerated track added Because of the timing of revision of the genera l education curriculum, limited success has been achieved in attaining incorporation of cultural co ntent into the General Education courses. However, considerable success was achieved with incorporation of cultural competency/inclusion components into the Nursing courses. 71 72 Overall Project Performance Analysis After a joint analysis of the pe rformance trend at Cox College, the project team identified the following key factors impacting performance: The President's/Project Director's vision and the faculty support . The President's vision and influence engendered the faculty support that lead to the stre ngthening of the curriculum. The integration of cultural competence into th e curriculum is an ongoing process subject to periodic review. Becoming more visible in the Cox College community . Exposure to Cox College as a result of the SPIN Project has been very beneficial in getting more st udents enrolled in Cox College. The SPIN Project also put forward an image of diversity for Cox College in the community. Overall Project Barriers Emphasis placed on nursing course curriculum development. As a result of the focus of the HRSA Nursing Workforce Diversity grant, the f aculty determined that they would implement the cultural competence components into the nursing courses first. The br oader, inclusive focus on curriculum change and the inco rporation into the ge neral education course s has not occurred at a rapid rate. Curriculum change process . The HRSA Nursing Workforce Di versity grant has served as a driving agent to curriculum change. The gran t has made a great impact despite the slow, methodical curriculum change process. Conclusion The SPIN Project has made an inestimable contri bution to the growth and development of Cox College, the maturation of the faculty and student body in terms of cultura l competence, and the enrollment of students from URM backgrounds in the general education and nur sing curricula. It is anticipated that the benef its will continue to accrue even in the absence of grant funding. However, it should be noted that investing in projects to increase the number of students from underrepresented minority backgrounds in nursing in geographic areas th at have numerically small populations of these individuals may have an impact th at exceeds those in areas with larg er populations. The increase in visibility and acceptance afforded by projects such as SPIN in these areas provides a deeper and broader impact than that in other areas. Also of note is the capacity to have a positive impact on the self-concept and sense of self-worth of student s from underrepresented minority groups for whom opportunities are much more proscribed in geogra phic areas that are pred ominantly populated by Caucasian individuals. The SPIN proj ect has served the Springfield co mmunity in both of these ways and can only be characteri zed as an unquestionable success. "}
