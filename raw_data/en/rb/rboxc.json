Welcome to Live Life! I'm so happy you're here. Are you tired of feeling sick and want to feel better? Do you desire good health for you and your family? You're in the right place. Many [studies](https://organicchemicalfree.com/resources-studies/) - plus my experience, and the experience of my clients - show that our indoor home environment may be causing or contributing to illnesses. And, we may not even realize it. Perhaps you have focused on Whole Health by eating more nutritious and organic food, increasing exercise or thinking positively. Every one of these things are important - and so is the environment we live in. How Does a Healthy Home Fit into Whole Health? A healthy home environment, sometimes called \"good indoor air quality,\" is deeply tied to every other aspect of Whole Health. In short, chemicals in our building materials and household products get into our bodies through breathing, eating and soaking into the skin. How we construct (or remodel/update) our homes and the products we buy directly affect how our bodies operate - in all aspects. That is why, despite best efforts, we might still be prone to illness. You might continue to dig for an answer. The process can feel exhausting and overwhelming. This is very common. There's lots of new information to learn, in some cases quickly. When we focus on our \"good, better, best\" options, and have a coach or partner to do it with, this whole process becomes much easier. What is Live Life? At Live Life, we help you transform your home into a healthy home. We help people remodel and build with healthy materials and processes, then fill their homes with non-toxic household products.
