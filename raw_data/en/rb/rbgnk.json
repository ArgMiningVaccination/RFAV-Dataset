Dr. Kory\u2014along with surprise () webinar guest Dr. Ryan Cole\u2014both attended the landmark event which was hosted by the European Parliament. A transcript of the proceedings will now be entered into the official record of [the European Parliament.](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en) So WHY was this gathering so important? And WHY should it matter to you? First, the summit provided us with robust testimonial evidence of fraud, lies, and sustained efforts to control populations across the world using fear, coercion, marginalization/persecution of non-conformists, and other strong-arm tactics. This comes at a time when the world is just starting to awaken from their almost hypnotic state\u2014which was induced by the relentless drone of the tactics noted above. New [peer-reviewed](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciimmunol.adh3455?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org), [scientific studies](https://correlation-canada.org/report-age-stratified-covid-19-vaccine-dose-fatality-rate-for-israel-and-australia/) are now emerging...seeing the light of day at last...and providing new, incontrovertible evidence of the sheer folly of mask mandates, lockdowns, and [most of all, the vaccines](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2804451)\u2014which we now know caused t [he deaths of more vaccinated people](https://www.primescholars.com/articles/forgotten-primum-non-nocere-and-increased-mortality-after--covid19-vaccination.pdf) than those who remained unvaccinated. Taken as a whole, the excerpted testimonies presented during the webinar illuminate the documented truth of what occurred\u2014and who must be held accountable. These include public health organizations and elected officials\u2014many of whom defied their sworn imperatives to safeguard human life and health. Their sacred oaths are now nothing more than wind-whipped rubbish, tumbling away into oblivion. Let us not forget the pharmaceutical companies and corporate interests that waged deceitful campaigns against efficacious repurposed drugs which, if used widely, would have obviated the need for nearly all mechanical ventilation and saved countless lives. Then there was the media\u2014which hungrily agreed to become ubiquitous partners in the murder of millions through false reporting, fear mongering and defamation/persecution of those who refused to parrot the official narrative. (We like to call those who bravely defied the narrative as \"The Honored Courageous.\") And what about the high-impact medical journals? Their perversion of science in the COVID-era through [mass retraction of peer-reviewed papers](https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/) and their refusal to publish robust science doomed millions. An irrevocable tenet that informs the FLCCC's organizational mission to develop safe, accessible and effective therapeutic protocols for the health benefit of every human being on earth is this: We know that our work is not just for today. It is for a thousand tomorrows as well\u2014for innumerable generations yet to come. We are certain that by rising to heal the broken places in the world where it is encouraged to place profits over people; where damnable lies are expected and normalized; where censorship is the birth mother of myriad death sentences; and where incontrovertible medical evidence is publicly flogged and mocked, we can help to create a new global health paradigm for the future, built upon the unshakable shoulders of human compassion. The event in Brussels revealed powerful evidence of deadly wrongdoings for which the evil purveyors must be called to account. Our work\u2014and that of myriad other like-minded organizations throughout the globe\u2014must never again be hindered by scorched-earth edicts meant to preserve profits; while caring not at all for those who suffer or perish in their wake. Those days are over. The body of testimonial evidence amassed in Brussels is mission-fuel. \"Putting Humanity First\" is our uncompromising mission goal \u2014 in perpetuity. Well, our Jenna McCarthy has done it again. She just makes SO. MUCH. GOOD. SENSE. In the month's \" [Here's a Thought](https://open.substack.com/pub/flccc/p/a-familiar-formula?r=nxypy&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email)\", Jenna writes that \"the infant formula industry's massive PR campaign against breastfeeding has striking parallels to the assault on natural immunity from COVID.\" Oh yes it does. Jenna writes: \"The infant formula industry once launched a massive PR campaign to portray breastfeeding as a poor mom's sport. \"The parallels to natural immunity from infection are so clear. Oh, you had COVID? That's nice. We still want you to take this experimental gene therapy that lists death (among hundreds of other debilitating ills) as a side effect.\" Fortunately, says Jenna, the \"truths are trickling out.\" [Read her brilliant essay ](https://open.substack.com/pub/flccc/p/a-familiar-formula?r=nxypy&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email)and learn how whistleblowers and physicians are coming out and finding their outside voices. In [this edition of Long (COVID) Story Short](https://odysee.com/@FrontlineCovid19CriticalCareAlliance:c/Berberine-Treats-Atherosclerosis-via-a-Vitamin-Like-Effect:f), our Dr. Been discusses an amazing study in which researchers demonstrate how berberine was able to reduce atherosclerotic plaque when administered for 4 months. This is incredible news for arteries everywhere! Uh...we should probably start this section of the FLCCC News Capsule by stating that several of our [FLCCC protocols](https://covid19criticalcare.com/treatment-protocols/) include the recommended use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as COVID-19 treatment or prevention therapeutics. OK. Now, here's the story. Hematologist/oncologist Dr. Vinay Prasad and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., founder of the [Children's Health Defense](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/), went head to head on social media this week on the efficacy of both hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for COVID. [Dr. Prasad, a former proponent of these drugs for COVID, said]that \"RCTs are the only way to judge medical therapies, and HCQ, ivermectin and masks all fail.\" [In a public letter on Twitter]to Dr. Prasad, RFK, Jr. said, \"I'd like to challenge you on your claims regarding HQ and ivermectin. There has been a great deal of fraud in the analysis of these two drugs for COVID...\" So, it is clear they do not agree, and it's ignited a bit of a dust-up on social media channels. After reading both sides, we are interested in hearing what you have to say about the kerfuffle. Tell us in the comments.

Paul Marik and Pierre Kory will be traveling to Bath in South West England to participate in the second annual [Better Way Conference](https://betterwayconference.org/). The goal is for attendees to hear the pioneers and innovators of our time reveal how excellent health has been hidden from us and explore what the reveal means for the Better World we will co-create.
