It may seem like a strange question, but it is one that legislators and parents are often left to grapple with. There are viral memes, posts, or articles claiming that certain ingredients in vaccines may violate certain religious traditions. Parents often hear misinformation that makes them feel confused about how to honor their religious faith and legislators who support the freedom of religion can feel conflicted between protecting public health and allowing a diversity of religious beliefs. Everyone needs clarity in this situation! Since we created this page the new COVID-19 vaccines has become available. In this update, we have gathered some links added below about how different religious organizations have directed their adherents with regard to this specific vaccine. We try whenever possible to rely on the websites run by religious organizations themselves, but we link to news coverage when that isn't possible. What are the real facts, and what do parents or lawmakers need to know? Real Fact 1 There are no major world religions that forbid vaccination. The vast majority of religious faiths want their followers to live healthy lives and know that vaccines are a boon to healthy children and thriving communities. While there are a few religions that have ideas about medicine that are outside of the mainstream, most allow for their adherents to make individual decisions about medical care and vaccination. Real Fact 2 Whether they are found online or holding signs in front of a government building, claims by antivaccine activists are not likely rooted in religion. While these activists do have deeply held fears related to vaccines, those fears have their roots in the belief that vaccines are harmful to health. Religious and political ideas (such as \"freedom of choice\") are often used to argue that they and their children should not have to get vaccinated, but the reason they don't want to vaccinate is because misinformation has convinced them that vaccines are harmful. Real Fact 3 Vaccine exemptions\u2014be they religious or philosophical\u2014put our most vulnerable community members at risk. Many members in our community are very young, very old, or very sick. Healthy school children stop the chain of transmission from getting to the vulnerable. We need to make sure that we close loopholes of convenience. If exemptions are allowed, they should not be easier to obtain than the vaccines themselves. An educational component would stop busy parents from simply filing exemptions if they forget to get vaccines completed on time. Real Fact 4 While there are a few vaccines with components grown in human cells, vaccines themselves do not contain fetal cell materials. These rumors began because there are two cell lines that began from fetal material in the 1960s. However, these cell lines are completely stable and lab grown. No new fetal tissue is needed for the continued stability of these cells, and the cells themselves are not present in any vaccination. View information below for statements certain religious organizations have made regarding vaccines and vaccination! The Seventh Day Adventists [state](https://www.adventist.org/articles/immunization/) they \"encourage responsible immunization/vaccination, and have no religious or faith-based reason not to encourage [their] adherents\" to get vaccinated. The Seventh Day Adventist Church has reaffirmed that it does not have religious-based objections to vaccines.

Evangelicals have different perspectives on vaccination, but many discuss seeking [\"common good\"](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/what-christians-should-know-vaccines/) from a Christian perspective in immunization to prevent harm to children by not getting vaccinated. Remember if you have questions about your religion and vaccines, talk to your religious leaders directly.
