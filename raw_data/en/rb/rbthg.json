However, it is our belief that many chronic health conditions can most effectively be resolved without allopathic medical intervention. Western medicine is called allopathic medicine and involves the treatment of superficial symptoms by chemical means called pharmaceuticals. It is a fundamental belief of Allopathic medicine that diseases can not be reversed but only managed and controlled by drugs. The western medical approach involves the treatment of symptoms rather than addressing causes. This approach may have short term success in eliminating acute symptoms but the long term effect of suppressing the body with chemicals is not ideal and is oftentimes harmful. Many people have experienced first hand the cold hearted and misguided pharmaceutical and symptom based palliative approach. Many people who had to endure the allopathic are no longer with us and we perhaps have memories of how our loved ones were treated without care or intelligence. Some people are asking if it makes sense to engage with somebody to help you regain health when they are not aware of the cause and have a strong financial interest in your treatment rather than your recovery. Simply put modern palliative medicine that most people endure does not address cause. We believe that a system that does not address cause is not likely to have the answer for returning to health. Why is The Medellin Wellness Protocol better in most cases? The Medellin Wellness Protocol approach is to improve health by addressing causes not symptoms. However when we use drugs to treat hypertension or diabetes or high cholesterol we are using chemicals that force the body to mask the symptoms without addressing the cause. It should not be far-fetched for anyone to realize that when the cause is eliminated the symptom disappears. The 5 Fundamental Factors of the system as outlined address the majority of what causes most people's deteriorated health conditions. The majority of what human beings are confronted with in the dimension of health relate to how we eat, how we exercise, how we think, how we rest, and how we live or don't live organically. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Our mission is n to provide an optimum physical and emotional environment for healing which we hope will maximize your ability to recover and restore your health.
