Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities experience a burden of disease much greater than other Australians. This means you are at a greater risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19. COVID-19 testing Getting tested for COVID-19 helps keep you and your mob safe. There are 2 types of tests for COVID-19: - Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), which is a nose and throat swab taken at a testing clinic and sent to a laboratory to be tested. PCR tests are the most accurate way to confirm if a person has COVID-19. - Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT), which is a quick way to detect COVID-19 using saliva or nasal swabs. People can collect free RATs from several ACT Government locations, including: - ACT Libraries (excluding Heritage Library) - Access Canberra service centres - where customers can pick up a RAT following a transaction, and - Canberra Health Services facilities, including hospitals, Walk-in Centres and health centres, where visitors are encouraged to do a RAT before entering. RATS are also widely available for purchase across Canberra, including at pharmacies, supermarkets and other retail stores. Canberrans are reminded to only enter and collect RATs from these locations if they are well and don't have COVID-19 symptoms. For most people, RATs are the easiest and fastest way to get diagnosed with COVID-19. However, some people may be recommended by their GP or treating health professional to have a PCR test. This might include those who are at [risk of severe COVID-19 illness](https://www.covid19.act.gov.au/stay-safe-and-healthy/covid-19-treatments). You can get a COVID-19 PCR test with a pathology form from a primary care provider. There are pathology collections across Canberra. Concession card holders who are recommended for PCR testing can access PCR testing from [participating collection centre](https://www.covid19.act.gov.au/symptoms-and-getting-tested/where-to-get-tested-in-the-act)s without a pathology request form. Eligible concession cards include: - Pensioner concession card - Commonwealth seniors' health care card - Health care card (including Low-income health care card) - Department of Veterans' Affairs gold, white or orange cards - ACT Government Service Access card. Watch this video from Dr Mark Wenitong as he explains how to use the different kinds of RATs. More information is available on the [COVID-19 testing page](https://www.covid19.act.gov.au/symptoms-and-getting-tested). COVID-19 vaccination Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a higher risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19. Encourage your family, elders and community to get vaccinated so that they are less likely to get really sick from COVID-19. You are recommended a 2023 booster if you are: - aged 65 years and over, or - aged 18 between to 64 years and have medical conditions that increase your risk of severe COVID-19, or with disability with significant or complex health needs. You can consider getting a 2023 booster if you are: - aged 18 to 64 years without risk factors for severe COVID-19, or - aged between 5 to 17 years and have medical conditions that increase your risk of severe COVID-19, or disability with significant or complex health needs. Booster doses are not recommended for young people under 18 years of age who do not have any risks factors for severe COVID-19. You should wait at least 6 months since your last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed COVID-19 infection (whichever is the most recent) before getting the 2023 booster.
