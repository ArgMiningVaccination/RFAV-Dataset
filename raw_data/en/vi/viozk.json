I begin these comments as I depart The Amazing Meeting 8 (TAM8), the James Randi Educational Foundation's big skeptics conference in Las Vegas. Martin Gardner's legacy was much in evidence, and indeed Gardner received a moving tribute from Randi at the beginning of a late- afternoon panel on the origin of the skeptics movement. Randi, Ray Hyman, and Paul Kurtz\u2014 three giants who, with Gardner, were present at the beginning\u2014and I talked about the events that led to the creation of CSICOP (now our Committee for Skeptical Inquiry) in 1976. Ray's, Randi's, and Paul's reminiscences also lead off this special Martin Gardner Tribute Issue of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, pp. 28-42. Many other colleagues and I also contribute, and we've added a small taste of Martin's writings. Back when Martin Gardner was writing his groundbreaking Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, he was a lone voice exposing pseudosci- entists and their foibles. But in the 1970s he was joined by Randi, Hyman, and a few others. Soon Paul Kurtz, with his organizational genius, had them (and fifty other scholars and investigators) assembled as our Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSI- COP, now CSI). Paranormal claims were ram- pant, and voices representing scientific thinking were much needed. From that single centralized group, the modern skeptics movement was born. The movement, has proliferated and is now much more diverse. Groups, publications, Web sites, podcasts, blogs, and innovative programs have spread across the planet. Some of the participants are well aware of how it all started; others came independently and are just doing their own thing. The AmazingMeeting seemed to be the chance for everyone to come together. Thirteen hundred people showed up and packed a huge ballroom devoted to all the sessions. CSI, for the first time, was a co-spon- sor of the event, along with the Skeptics Society. Women are now much more a part of the scene, which is a very welcome improvement. At a panel on women and skepticism, six prominent women skeptics (Ginger Campbell, Pamela Gay, Harriet Hall, Jennifer Michael Hecht, Carol Tavris, and Rebecca Watson) pondered this topic and welcomed the significant proportion of females in the audience. All audiences were younger than usual, too\u2014another welcome sign. Just as new generations of students need to be educated, new generations of skeptics are learning the ropes, with many already hard at work, much of which is excellent. Skeptical inquiry is not only important, it is fun, and that aspect draws in even more peo- ple. All this is refreshing. We need all these talented, diverse people. That's because the venues for uncritical promulgation of unsupported claims have likewise proliferated as endless cable TV chan- nels and constantly multiplying new electronic media. Some criticism at the conference was directed at fellow skeptics. Such self-criticism is another healthy sign. Astronomer Phil Plait gave heartfelt warnings for skeptics to be careful of their tone if they want to be effective. Philosopher/biologist Massimo Pigliucci spoke out against skeptics who allow their ideology to trump objective science and argued that one of skepticism's roles is to sup- port good science, not undermine it. Martin Gardner didn't go to conferences, but I think he would have liked this one. He would have enjoyed seeing a movement he inspired be so alive, vital, robust, and mature\u2014while appeal- ing to and drawing in motivated new generations. \u2014KENDRICKFRAZIER Hyman, Kurtz, Randi, and INQUIRER September / October 2010 5N E W S A N D C O M M E N T Study Links Carbon Dioxide to Near-Death Experiences According to a new study published in the April 8, 2010, issue of the medical journal Critical Care (\"The Effect of Car - bon Dioxide on Near-Death Experi encesin Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Sur -vivors: tional Study\"), people who have elevated levelsof carbon dioxide in their blood reporthaving experiences identical to near-deathexperiences. The study examined fifty-two heart attack patients in three large hospitals. Ofthose, eleven reported experiences such asmoving toward a bright light, feelings ofpeace and joy, and profoundly spiritualmoments. Studies suggest that betweenone in four and one in ten heart attacksurvivors report having such experiences. The exact cause has remained a mys- tery, but the new study provides a clue.Heart attacks occur when the supply of blood (and therefore oxygen) is blockedfrom the heart. The heart stops circulat- ing blood, and as a result, the brain is deprived of oxygen. This in turn canincrease carbon dioxide in the blood.Carbon dioxide is toxic in high concen- trations, starting at about 1 percent of the inhaled air (10,000 parts per million).Pain-killing endorphins are released in response to the stress of the heart attack, and they dull the pain and can cause ela- tion or hallucinations. The link between oxygen deprivation in the brain and near-death experience has been suggested for many years. British researcher Susan Blackmore,author of Dying to Live: Near-Death Ex - peri ences,notes that many characteristics of typical near-death experiences (suchas euphoria and the feeling of moving toward a white light) are also symptoms of oxygen deprivation. In fact, several sub stances have been found to causenear-death or out-of-body experiences,including ketamine (a hallucinogen sim- that is used mainly as an anesthetic). Though many believe that near-death experiences provide evidence of life after death, the fact that such experiences can be chemically induced points to a nat- ural\u2014instead of supernatural\u2014cause. \u2014Benjamin Radford Benjamin Radford is managing editor of the S KEPTICAL INQUIRER and author of the new book Scientific Paranormal Investi ga tion: How to Solve Unexplained Mysteries . His Web site is at www.radfordbooks.com. Alternative Medicine Guru Nearly Killed by Own Supplements Health guru Gary Null, nutrition au thor and marketer of dietary supplements, including Gary Null's Ultimate PowerMeal, filed a lawsuit against a manufac-turer because he claims that he nearly died after taking his own supplements. Null claims that after consuming two doses of his Ultimate Power Meal each day for a month as directed, he experi- enced severe kidney damage, \"excruciat- ing fatigue along with bodily pain,\" and bleeding \"within his feet.\" Null claims that the manufacturer, Triarco Indus tries, put 1,000 times the correct dose of Vita - min D in his product. According to Null's attorney, at least a half-dozen other consumers also became sick from the tain ted supplement. Alternative medicines, herbal reme- dies, and dietary supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Admin - istration because they are not marketedas drugs. According to the Dietary Sup - ple ment Health and Educa tion Act of1994, \"The dietary supplement manu- facturer is responsible for ensuring that a dietary supplement is safe before it is marketed. ... Manufac turers must make sure that product label information is truthful and not misleading.\" Indeed, there is no requirement that these substances be scientifically tested for safety or efficacy, and many have been proven ineffective for the condi- tions for which they are used. Supple - ments often contain doses and ingredi- ents wildly different than what is indi- cated on their labels, as this case demon- strates. The vitamin and herbal supple- ment industry, a multi-billion-dollar business, has lobbied hard to keep its products from being regulated by the FDA. As a result, the FDA can step in only when something goes wrong, such as after people have been injured or killed by natural herbs. That happened in 2004, when the FDA banned ephedra, an her bal remedy used in tradi- tional Chi nese medicine for thousands of years. Mill ions of consumers took the herb on the belief that it was natural, safe, and effective\u2014until the supple-ment was linked to over one hundred deaths. Ironically, Null and his customers would likely not have been poisoned if his products were held to the same stan- dards and regulations that pharmaceuti- cals are subjected to\u2014and which Null and others in the \"alt med\" industry have long rejected. \u2014Benjamin Radford MJ 2010 7/22/10 56Volume 34, ISSUE 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERWhat's New? Observations on Science and Fringe Science from Bob Park Cell Phones: Lawyers May Be Planning a Mass Tort Blitz On June 15 the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted 10-1 to require retailers to post the \"specific absorption rate\" (SAR) of cell phones. Others will follow. The story began in 1988 when David Reynard gave his wife, Susan, a cell phone. She died of brain cancer four years later; as David explained on Larry King Live, \"she held it against her head and talked on it all the time\" (What's New, January 29, 1993). With such compelling evidence, David Reynard sued the cell phone industry. Con fronted with pseudoscience, the first question is: who profits by this? With an estimated five bil- lion cell phones in use, it's fertile soil for a \"mass tort blitz,\" the dream of every tort lawyer. As in the asbestos and tobacco industries, some companies face so many lawsuits that it becomes cheaper to settle than to defend. (June 18) Cell Phones: The High Cost of Scientific Ignorance An opportunity to explain one of the simplest and most pow- erful concepts of science to the public is slipping away. A month ago the World Health Organization (WHO) released its long-awaited Interphone study of cell phones and brain cancer in thirteen countries. The ten-year, $14 million, case- control study reports that \"no increase in risk of glioma or meningioma was observed with the use of mobile phones.\" That's the right answer, so what's the problem? We already knew that cell phones don't cause cancer. We've known it for years. From the media coverage, you would think these guys just discovered it. Let's go to the next sentence: \"There were suggestions of an increased risk of glioma at higher exposure levels, but biases and error prevented a causal interpretation.\" So is there a supernatural interpretation? That one sentence undoes everything in the study. Case control requires human recollection; at their best, case-control studies are to science as polls are to elections. They may come out the same, but you can't count on it. (June 25) Conservation of Energy: Yes, Biology Must Also Obey the Law Ten years ago a group in Denmark published a beautiful epi- demiological study of cell phones and brain cancer in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI) (Johan sen, C., Boice, J.D., Jr., McLaugh lin, J.K., Olsen, J.H. Cellu lar Tele - phones and Cancer\u2014A Nationwide Cohort Study in Den -mark. JNCI93 [2001]: 2037). The study was based entirely on existing public records: the Danish Can cer Registry, mobile phone charges, death records, subscriptions, etc. The conclusion was unequivocal: there is no correlation between cell phone use and the incidence of brain cancer. It was nice to have that fact confirmed, but it was not a sur- prise. I was invited to write an editorial on how scientists should respond to the cell phone/brain cancer question for the same issue of JNCI. Cancer agents act by creating mutant strands of DNA. In the case of electromagnetic radiation, there is a sharp threshold for this process at the extreme blue end of the visible spectrum. Albert Einstein explained this with the photoelectric effect in 1905, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1921. Cell phones operate at a frequency about one million times lower than the ultraviolet threshold and hence cannot be a cause of cancer. It's important to recognize that the frequency, not the intensity, of radiation makes it a cancer agent. (June 25) (For more on the cell phone scare, see theSeptember/October 2009 issue of the S KEPTICALINQUIRER.) COSMOS: An Acronym I Am at Present Unable to Decipher The WHO study that prompted the board's decision seemed to settle nothing. Indeed, even as the non-results were announced, still another mobile phone study, the COSMOS cohort study of health effects in five European countries, to be carried out at Imperial College London over a period ofthirty years, was announced. It must be a joke; in thirty years the technology will be completely different. (June 18) Fake Bomb Detector: The High Cost of Ignorance According to a story in The Independent (U.K.) on June 8, the investigation into the sale of fake bomb detectors has been expanded to a number of firms in the U.K. That golfers were buying fraudulent golf-ball finders seemed comicalfourteen years ago. The Quadro Tracker was nothing but an \"antenna\" mounted on a pistol grip with a swivel that was free to rotate 360 degrees. An almost imperceptible deviation of the swivel from horizontal would cause the antenna to rotate under the force of gravity to its lowest point. To a cred- ulous observer it might seem to be controlled by some mys- terious external force. Quadro soon began marketing the tracker to law enforcement agencies and the Department of Defense for $995 each to search for drugs and weapons. But it failed a simple scientific test. Sandia National Labs took one apart and found it contained no internal parts. TheSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:40 PM September / October 2010 7FBI shut Quadro down and arrested its officers ( What's New, January 26, 1996). However, the device soon reappeared in the U.K. as the ADE 651, sold by ATSC for prices as high as $48,000. At least 1,500 were sold to the government of Iraq as bomb detectors at a cost of millions of dollars, as What's Newreported in January ( What's New, January 29, 2010). The fake bomb detectors have reportedly contributed to hundreds of bomb deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan, including British and American troops. (June 11) (For more on fake bomb detectors, see SI News and Comment, May/June 2010.) Magical Thinking: Dowsing Is Not Illegal in the U.S. or the U.K. In spite of the heinous nature of the ATSC crime, it may be difficult to ob tain a conviction. The defense of those charged with selling fake bomb detectors will be that they believe the devices work. Their defense will point to the hundreds or thousands of people who openly market their services to dowse for water or other substances. Some times called water- witching, dowsing is said to rely on supernatural influence over the muscles of the person holding a willow fork or an ADE 651. Dowsing doesn't always work, but what does? The prosecution will find itself hip deep in arguments over how an ADE 651 differs from prayer. Magical thinking will be with us until children are taught that observable effects result only from physical causes, and they must be taught at the time they are learning their first language. (June 11) Lies: The Animal That Talks Often Tells Lies The polygraph can't tell a lie from the sex act. But four years ago we predicted that functional magnetic resonance imag- ing (fMRI) might (What's New, June 23, 2006). The defen- dant in a Ten nessee court case sought to use fMRI to demon- strate his veracity. The judge did not allow it. Good! The only thing worse than a lie detector that doesn't work is one that does. It would be the ultimate invasion of privacy. (June 11) Nativis Inc.: Haunted by the Ghost of Jacques Benveniste A start-up in La Jolla, California, expects to transform the way medicine is delivered. The company says it's based on the work of several Nobel physicists including Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman. A video of Feynman giving a talk on quantum electrodynamics (QED) is posted on its Web site. Based on QED, Nativis claims pharmaceuticals have electro- magnetic signatures that convey the same effect as the drug itself. It's homeopathy done backwards. Homeopathy starts with medicine and dilutes it sequentially until it's just water. Nativis, by contrast, starts with pure water and exposes it tovery-low-frequency electromagnetic radiation, which of course does nothing at all to the water. However, Nativis is convinced that the ordinary water will now behave like med- icine. This is lunacy, and not even original lunacy. In 1988 Jacques Benveniste, a French biochemist, con- vinced himself that water can be made homeopathic by expos- ing it to low-frequency electromagnetic waves. I challenged him publicly in the May 17, 1999, issue of Timemagazine to an intercontinental test involving an exchange of samples. Ben veniste agreed but said he needed a little time. Weeks grew into months. Months into years. He died five years later with- out completing the test. I think I know why. Homeopaths see ordinary water and convince themselves it's magic water. Nativis must do the same. (June 4) Acupuncture: Gimpy Mice Bamboozle NatureMagazine A team at Rochester University led by neuroscientist Maiken Nedergaard studied the production of adenosine when pain is inflicted on the hind paw of a mouse. Adenosine is a neuro- modulator that reduces pain. If the mouse is then stuck with an acupuncture needle, the production of adenosine persists for a longer time. I suppose it might last longer still if the mouse's tail is pulled. Nedergaard says her study may open the way to making acupuncture more effective. Even Daniel Cressy, writing in Nature,said the study \"makes acupuncture seem less alternative,\" but I can't see how. The acupuncture needle was inserted just below the knee in the Zusanli point, which is supposedly for the stomach, not paws. This study does nothing to answer the basic scientific questions: what is the evidence for the meridians or the mysterious qi, and how are acupuncture points determined? Pressed on these points, acupuncturists fall back on the Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine , but that book is at least 2,000 years old. No matter\u2014they freelance a lot. (June 4) Jesus Statue: Gaze on My Works Ye Mighty and Despair A familiar landmark in southwestern Ohio, the six-story statue of Jesus from the torso up, was nicknamed Touch down Jesus because the arms were raised like a referee signaling a touchdown. Con structed of plastic foam over a steel frame, it was consumed by fire after being struck by lightning, as if to invite comparison. (June 18) \u2014Robert L. Park Robert L. Park is professor of physics at the University of Mary - land and author of Voo doo Science and Superstition . He is a Committee for Skeptical Inquiry fellow. These items are from his weekly What's New electronic newsletter (archives at difficult to set up experi- ments that seemingly \"prove\" that bogus treatments work. Health jour- nalists, in particular, are regularly taken in by such bogus studies, and the mis- leading results are subsequently reported in the press, perpetuating the public's belief in these treatments. I will give several examples from the realm of \"alternative\" medicine. Theyare, of course, entirely fictitious. Not that there is a shortage of real ones, but these days one has to be careful not toend up in the hands of libel lawyers (see \"Keep Libel Out of Science,\" SI, May/June 2010). Bogus Experiment No. 1 Most clinical trials test whether one treatment is better than another. These studies are called \"superiority trials.\" Other studies are aimed at testing whether one therapy is as effective as another. They are called \"equivalence trials.\" My first example is an equiva- lence trial comparing a highly dilute homeopathic remedy with an acceptedand well-known drug, say paracetamol (known in the U.S. as acetaminophen). Take two hundred patients with asprained ankle and randomize them totake homeopathic arnica (the experimen- tal treatment) or paracetamol (the control treatment). One or two days later, mea- sure the swelling of the injured ankle as an undeniably objective outcome measure.The results will show that the swellingdiminished in both groups and that no difference between the two groupsemerged. The conclusion, therefore, isthat both are equally effective; however, homeopathy (not having any actual active ingredient) caused fewer adverse events. The headline in the papers might read: \"Homeo pathy Better than Paracetamol.\" The trick here is to select an outcome measure that is not affected by the\"accepted and well-known\" drug. Para -cetamol does not reduce swelling, and few people would claim otherwise. Thus, it acts as a placebo. Comparing two differ- ent placebos should always result in equivalence. Yet the illusion can be quite convincing. Bogus Experiment No. 2 My second fictitious study is also an equiv - alencetrial. It compares homeopathic care against conventional medicine for a seri- ous chronic condition, say Crohn's dis-ease. Twenty patients are randomized to be treated with either ap proach. The results demonstrate that the carefully cho- sen endpoint (e.g., a symptom score) re - veals no differences between the groups. The conclusion: homeopathy is as effec-tive as standard treatment of Crohn's dis- ease. The headline this time? \"Homeo tifically Proven to Work for Life-Threatening Diseases.\" The trick here is to underpower the study dramatically. Underpowered equiv-alence trials will tend to (falsely) suggestequivalence between the two tested approaches\u2014a safe bet for illusionists. Bogus Experiment No. 3 Another approach is to conduct a \"prag- matic\" trial. Such studies are currently very popular because, according to their proponents, they best reflect the \"reallife\" situation of clinical practice. In this trial, chronically ill patients are random- ized to receive either standard care (the control group) or standard care plushomeopathy (the experimental group). The primary measure of outcome for that study could be patient satisfaction, well-being, quality of life, or some other subjective endpoint. Due to the regular,lengthy, empathetic encounters received by the latter group, patients are boundto feel better and improve. IllusionistsCOMMENTARY Illusionists at Work How to 'Prove' That Bogus Treatments Are Effective EDZARD ERNST 8Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIREREdzard Ernst, MD, PhD, is in the Complementary Medicine unit, Peninsula Medical School, Uni versities of Exeter and Plymouth, U.K. SI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:40 PM Page 8will then interpret this benefit as being caused by the specific effects of the homeopathicremedies. The headline: \"Homeopathy Proven to Help Chron ically Ill Patients.\" The trick, in this case, is that A (standard care) plus B (homeopathy) is al ways morethan A alone (A<A+B)\u2014unless, of course, B is zero. But an empathetic encounter does, of course, have an impact on many subjective outcome measures. If, in clinical trials, we do not control for nonspecific effects, it is always easy to make a treatment look effective, even in a randomized trial. Bogus Experiment No. 4 My last illusionists' stunt is an animal study. Such experiments, it is often (falsely) claimed, are not affected by placebo effects. Ten experi- mental rats receive a diet to which either a homeopathic product or a placebo is added.The aim here is not to test for therapeuticeffects but to find out whether homeopathycan cause a biological effect in principle. Allconceivable types of bias and confounding areexcluded. The study can be designed to becompletely watertight. The rats receive thetreatments and are observed for several weeks. At the end of this period, all rats in the home- opathy group have died, but all of the control animals are alive. The conclusion: homeopathy generates biological effects and is thus different from placebo. The headline: \"Animal Experi - ments Prove the Principles of Homeopathy.\" The trick is simple: we need only to select the right \"remedy\" (and \"hide\" this in the small print of the experiment). For my fictitious experiment, I chose a \"mothertincture\" ofarsenic. This is pure, undiluted, and very toxicarsenic, yet it is strictly speaking a homeopathic preparation. The conclusion? Bogus experiments are not difficult to set up, and it is not difficult to fool uncritical people with their results. But they are still only tricks of illusionists who aim to mis- lead us. It follows that, if we fail to apply our skills of critical assessment or, worse still, we never had such skills, illusionists pretending to be scientists can be a menace. /hwysquare SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October 2010 9 There's much more content available on our Web site!

Thanks to hismany appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and now with his own Oprah- sponsored The Dr. Oz Show , he has sud- denly become the nation's most famous heart surgeon.

It is not widely known that Oz has been profoundly influenced by EmanuelSwedenborg, a Swedish Protestant funda-mentalist who, late in life, became a spir-itualist and Sweden's most famous trancemedium. In the November/December2007 issue of Spirituality and Health , a glossy bimonthly devoted to New Age topics, Oz coauthored an article titled \"Mehmet Oz Finds His Teacher,\" about how his wife Lisa introduced him to the theology of Sweden borg. (Lisa, by the way, is a Reiki Master. Reiki is a Japanese form of alternative medicine developed by a Buddhist monk.) Once greatly admired by thinkers as diverse as Emerson, Goethe, Blake,William James's father, and John Chap - man\u2014better known as Johnny Apple - seed\u2014Swedenborg is now almost for-gotten except for a small cult following. Here is a thumbnail biography. Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was a respected Swedish scientist until middle age, when Jesus appeared to him in a vision. The Lord persuaded him to abandon science and devote the rest of his life to theology. After Swedenborg's death,his followers in England founded The Church of the New Jerusalem based onhis fifty or so books. Remnants of this church still flourish in England and in the United States, where Swedenborgiansnumber an estimated 6,000. Swedenborg never doubted that every verse in the Bible was God inspired. His deviations from orthodoxy resulted fromendless trances that today would be calledOBEs (out-of-body experiences). Amonghis many books, the most popular by far was Heaven and Hell . Sweden borg claim - ed to have visited both regions in his trances, where he supposedly spoke with angels, devils, and spirits of the departed.His book contains detailed descriptions of heaven and hell. All of Swedenborg's books were writ- ten in Latin. A series titled Heavenly Se - cretsconsists of eight volumes. Al though he never married, Conjugal Love was a widely read treatise. Another popular book, Apocalypse Revealed , is a verse-by- verse analysis of the Bible's Book ofRevelation. Swedenborg's most worthless book,Life on Other Worlds, contains\u2014fasten your seatbelt!\u2014detailed accounts of his out-of-body travels to the five then- known planets, the Moon, and five planets outside the solar system. On each of these worlds he was able to chatwith the human inhabitants and the bodiless spirits of deceased humans who serve the inhabitants. He also visited the heavens and hells of some worlds, where he spoke with humans who becameangels and humans evil enough to be -come demons. Some of these trips \"lasteda day,\" he writes, \"others a week, and yet others for months.\" Swedenborg's first visit was to Mer - cury. Its spirits were able to invade his brain, searching for facts and knowledge but having no interest in ideas or opin- ions. The most notable spirit he meets isnone other than Aristotle. We are toldhe was a wise man in contrast to his many \"foolish\" Earth followers. The human inhabitants of Mercury are slimmer than earthlings. Their women have smaller faces. Their clothes are tight fitting. In spite of Mercury's nearness to the sun, its atmosphere shields the planetfrom the sun's heat, producing a climate\"not too hot or too cold.\" Swedenborg then visits Jupiter. Its land is called \"fertile.\" (Swedenborg hadno way of knowing that Jupiter has no land.) Its inhabitants' main concern is bringing up their children, whom theydearly love. They are free of all evil impulses, such as stealing and greatercrimes. They know nothing of wars but NOTES OF A FRINGE WATCHER M A R T I N G A R D N E R Swedenborg and Dr. Oz Martin Gardner submitted this column May 12, 2010, ten days before his death.

Their horses resemble ours, only smaller. I was further informed by the spirits from that world about various matters concerning its inhabitants, such as their way of moving, and their food and houses. When moving, they do not walk upright like the inhabitants of this and many other worlds; nor do they go on all fours like animals, but when they walk they help themselveswith the flat of their hands, at every other pace half rising to their feet. As they move, at every third pace they turn their faces to one side and look behind them, making a slight twist, quickly accomplished, of the body. This is because they think it impoliteto be seen by others except face to face. I spare the reader Swedenborg's ac - counts of the inhabitants and spirits on Mars and Saturn. Venus is more inter-esting because its humans are of two kinds: one \"gentle\" and \"humane,\" the other as fierce as wild animals. The two groups, along with their spirits, live onopposite sides of Venus. Their heavens and hells are nearby. Swedenborg devotes only three pages to the spirits and inhabitants of theMoon. The humans are small as dwarfs, but when they speak, their voices\u2014which come from their abdomens\u2014 roar like thunder. Swedenborg assures us that the moons of other solar-system planets are also inhabited by humansand their spirits, but he gives no details.His trip to our moon is followed by vis- its to five planets in what he calls our \"starry sky,\" far beyond our sun. I should add that the humans on our planets all worship Jesus, although he was incarnated only on Earth. Sweden - borg devotes a chapter to explaining why Jesus chose our world as a place to live as a man and die for our salvation. In other writings Swedenborg claims that the Lord's Second Coming, and the judgment of who is to be saved and who is not, actually took place in our heaven in 1757. (He was convinced, by the way, that faith in Jesus is insufficient forescaping hell. That faith must be com-bined with charity, or good works.) If you are interested in reading Life on Other Worlds, a paperback translation titled Life on Other Planets was pub- lished in 2006 by the Swede n borg Foundation in West Chester, Penn - sylvania, and the Sweden borg Soci ety in London. Copies are readily available on the Internet. The book contains a lengthy intro- duction by Raymond Moody, author of many books about NDEs (near death experiences) of persons whose hearts momentarily stopped beating and who had visions of entering heaven, some- times even seeing Jesus. Moody believes NDEs are genuine out-of-body events similar to Swedenborg's trances. He strives mightily, without success, to find something of lasting merit in Sweden - borg's crazy book. Now for Dr. Oz's fascination with Swedenborg's other, saner writings. \"When Lisa and I got married,\" he writes in Spirituality and Health, \"there was no 'til death do us part in the cere- mony.\" Swedenborg had convinced Oz and Lisa that marriages are intended to last forever in paradise. \"After death the veil that separates the spiritual from the material world is lifted,\" Oz goes on, \"and we continue in our true selves\u2014either as angels or evil spirits, depending on whether we have internally made a heaven or hell for our- selves while living here.\" Angels, as de - scribed by Swedenborg, \"are not a sepa-rate species, but people who are regener- ate\u2014literally reborn humans.\" This, of course, is contrary to what the Bible says about angels and demons. Swedenborgism, Oz believes, is close to Buddhism. \"Zen Master D.T. Sesuki,\" Oz writes, \"once referred to Swe den borg as 'the Buddha of North.'\" A Sweden borg would have vio- lently disagreed. The number of alternative medicines that Oz favors is not known. He believes, contrary to most doctors, that acupunc- ture really works, that its effect on pain is more than a placebo. Acupuncture should always be supplemented, says Oz, by what he calls the Dr. Oz Diet to lose weight. On an episode of The Oprah Winfrey ShowOz supervised an acupuncture treat- ment for a pain in Oprah's shoulder. Oprah said she could hardly feel the nee- dles and that the pain had vanished afterthe treatment. In the April 2010 issue of O, Oprah's magazine, Oz's daughter Daphne authored an article on \"The Se - crets of Acupuncture.\" It is hard to believe, but Oz also rec- ommends homeopathy! Homeopaths are convinced that the more dilute a drug, the more potent it is. Accordingly, they dilute their medications until only a few or no molecules remain. Somehow, in a way totally unknown to science, the di - lutant \"remembers\" the missing mole- cules! Mainstream doctors like to tell of the homeopath who forgot to take his daily pill and died of an overdose. In the November 2009 issue of O, Oz recommended homeopathy for treat ing migraines. \"Acupuncture and ho me - opathy are worth considering,\" he wrote, \"as adjunct therapies once you are sure the headache is not a sign of a serious disorder.\" Ophthalmologists all agree that eye refraction problems, such as near- and far-sightedness and astigmatism, can be relieved only by corrective lenses or eye surgery. Oz thinks otherwise; search Google for \"Dr. Oz, eye exercises.\" Also search on Oz and acupuncture, home- opathy, remedies, and cancer. Oz is a fine cardiac surgeon. Unlike the Wizard of Oz, he is not a humbug, but one should be wary of his far-out medical advice.

Claims that he fore- saw the rise of Napoleon and of Hitler,among other world events, are beingsupplemented by assertions that he divined the terrorist strikes of Sep tember11, 2001, and the end-times brouhahaover 2012. I have taken a fresh look at several of his more famous quatrains, translatingthem from sixteenth-century French de (1503-1566), better known by the Latinized Nostra - damus, was a French physician and astrologer who has been variously de - scribed as a scholar, a sorcerer, and a fraud. He became wealthy and honored, especially at the French court where Henry II's queen, Catherine de Med\u00ecci(1519-1589), was a patron of astrologers and sorcerers.Nostradamus's major work was a col- lection of quatrains (four-line rhyming verses) numbering one thousand andarranged in groups of a hundred called centuries. The first 353 quatrains were published in 1555 as Les Proph\u00e9ties de M. Michel Nostradamus, and they werefollowed by other volumes. The verses'vague, symbolic language meant thatthey could be interpreted in differentways in different times, and\u2014by aprocess known as retrofitting (after-the- fact matching)\u2014an event could in hind-sight look as if it had been predicted bythe supposed seer. It is sometimes said that Nostra damus wrote in \"Old French\" (Stray 2009, 264), but that term is reserved for the French language of the ninth to fourteenth cen- turies. Nostradamus actually wrote in Middle French, which was used in the fif-teenth and sixteenth centuries. (Modern French has been used from the seven- teenth century to the present. See Encyclo - s.v. \"French have ten syllables each and a mid-linepause, or caesura, for rhetorical effect. The lines rhyme ABAB. The constraints of this poetic form caused him to engage in various verbal strategies, such as using compressed language, even abbreviations. Translating Nostradamus is difficult at best, and one who would translate into verse must\u2014like the original versi- fier\u2014make things fit. I have tried to fol- low Nostradamus's word choice when possible, but out of necessity I have Joe Nickell, PhD, is CSI's senior research fellow. His many books include Real-Life X-Files, Entities, and Adventures in Para normal Investigation. 12Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERINVESTIGATIVE FILES J O E N I C K E L L Nostradamus: A New Look at an Old SeerSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/29/10 10:11 AM September / October 2010 13occasionally used synonyms, altered the syntax, and made other modifications\u2014 including sometimes settling for near rhyme rather than full rhyme. The Quatrains Here are ten of Nostradamus's most sig- nificant quatrains first given in the orig- inal Middle French and then recast intomodern English verse and discussed. 1. The Death of King Henry II. One of Nostradamus's most famous proph ecies\u2014number I:35\u2014is also \"the cruelle. My translation: The young lion shall overcome the old, On field of battle by single duel; He'll smash his eyes with a casing of gold: Two fleets one, then to die, a death cruel. Published in 1555, this verse is said to predict the accidental death of KingHenry II, the quatrain's \"old lion.\" Re - portedly, during a French jousting tourna- ment in 1559, a splinter of a broken lance went through the visor of the King'sgolden helmet (Nostradamus's \"cage of gold\") and thence through his eye into his brain. He subsequently suffered and died \"a cruel death\" (Roberts 1949, 20). Alas, the quatrain was clearly not intended to refer to Henry. Just three years after publishing it, in mid-1558, Nostradamus penned a letter to the king, saying that he expected him to live a long life and predicting wonderful things in his future. Moreover, a tourna- ment is not a \"field of battle\"; the verse refers to \"eyes,\" plural; and there is noknown precedent for a golden helmet (gold is a soft metal), certainly not in the case of Henry (Randi 1993, 175). So Nostradamians are simply retrofitting, attempting to adapt later events to the French seer's murky statements. The same is true of the word classes\u2014inter-preted by some Nostradamians as \"wounds\" (from Greek klasis). 1(It may mean \"classes\" or \"knells\" or\u2014if the word is really the Latin classis\u2014\"fleets.\") The sense of the verse is that an old leader is slain by a younger one, thus unifying their forces. 2. The Coming of Napoleon .A rather typical Nostradamus quatrain,number I:60, illustrates how very differ- ent interpretations trouuera moins prince que boucher. I translate the rather plain text of qua- train I:60 as follows: A ruler will be born near Italy, Whose cost to the Empire shall be quite dear; They will say from those whom he shall rally That he is less a prince than a butcher. The phrase \"near Italy\" covers a lot of ground, from Austria and Corsica to France and Switzerland, and Greece and Yugoslavia. The verse is usually held to refer to Napoleon (1769-1821), but other candidates include the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II (1578-1637) andeven Adolph Hitler (1889-1945). (SeeLeVert 1979, 80; Randi 1982, 34.)(Another quatrain [VIII:1] that is also said to refer to Napoleon begins with the three words Pau, Nay, Oloron, which are interpreted [Robb 1961, 43-44] as an imperfect anagram [\"Nay- pau-lon-Roy\"] of Napoleon Roi[\"King\"]. However, Napoleon was not a king, and the words are simply the names of three proximate French towns [Randi 1982, 207-212].) 3. The Rise of Adolph Hitler . Another quatrain, II:24, is said to refer to Adolph Hitler most specifically. Nos - tradamus (1555) wrote: Bestes They'll swim the rivers, fiercely fam- ished brutes: Most of the army shall range the Ister; In an iron cage will be drawn The Great When Rhine's child shall Germany watch over. Histeris said to denote \"Hitler,\" and in the late 1930s Nazi propaganda min-ister Josef Goebbels, whose wife was \"an avid Nostradamian,\" exploited this and other quatrains that supposedly prophe- sied France's fall after a German invasion (Hogue 2003, 313). Hister, or rather Ister, is actually an old name for the lower Danube River. The last line of the quatrain is rather confus-ing, and translators have given many dif- ferent renderings. Some later texts re - placed Rinwith Rine(\"the Rhine\") or rien(\"nothing\"). And Ger maincan mean \"Germany\" or another word of the exact same spelling, i.e., \"brother\" or \"cousin.\" And so the verse could read, \"When achild [of the] Rhine shall keep watch over his brother\" (LeVert 1979, 111), or \"When the Ger man child watches theRhine\" (Robb 1961, 47), or \"When the Ger man child will observe nothing\" (Leoni 1982, 169), or other possibilities. How ever, because Hister, Rin, and Germainare all capitalized (Nostra damus Nostradamus [III:58] uses Rinfor \"Rhine\" translate the words as \"Ister,\" \"Rhine,\"and \"Germany.\" LeVert (1979, 111) ob - serves that, Nostra damus's contempo- raries, the \"Child of the Rhine\" would indicate Charles V (1500-1558). 4. The Great London Fire. This ob - scure verse\u2014quatrain II:51\u2014has re ceived increasing attention, some believing that it forecast the Great Fire of London in1666. Nostradamus (1555) par fouldres de vint les place haute: translate the quatrain thusly: Blood of the just in London shall be scarce, With twenty three seized, by thun- derbolts burned. The senile lady shall fall from high place: Of the same sect many more will be slain.Nostradamus's verse does specifically mention London and people burned. The falling of the \"old lady\" (La dame antique) is said to be \"the subsequent falling of the statue of the Virgin from St. Paul's steeple\" (Roberts 1949, 6), though there appears to have been no such statue (Randi 1993, 191). The phrase that translates as \"twenty three the six\" (or \"sixes\")\u2014three times twenty plus six\u2014could suggest the year '66. However, line two is missing a syllable and may be corrupt. Printers of the erasometimes set type as someone read the text aloud (Gaskell 1972, 49, 112-13), sowhat sounded like Brusl\u00e9s par fouldres de vint trois les six might actually have read, Brusl\u00e9s par fouldres plus de vint trois saisis (\"Burned by more thantwenty-three seized\"). In any case, Nos - tradamian skeptics propose a reasonable explanation of this verse\u2014that it is a con-temporaneous reference to Queen Mary Tudor of England (\"Bloody Mary\"[1516-1558]) and her persecution ofProtestants, many of whom were burned at the stake. Her atrocities resulted in her downfall. The word antiquein the third line usually means \"ancient\" but can also mean \"eccentric\" or \"senile.\" Mary was considered de ranged and at her death was incoherent and apparently insane(LeVert 1979, 123-24; Randi 1993, 191-92). 5. A Mysterious Forecast. Among Nostra damus's cryptic verses is quatrain III:58, which while historically murky is in another sense quite illuminating. Theseer wrote (Nostradamus 1555): Aupres du Rin the this way: Close by the Rhine from the Noric mountains, A great one's born of people come too late. He'll defend Saurome and Pannonians; It shall not be learned what has been his fate. Nostradamus predicts the birth of a \"great one\" whose people are late arrivers to a region \"near the Rhine from the Noric mountains\" (the Noric Alps). This leader will defend \"Saurome\" (as itshould be spelled, a Slavic area, nowLithuania) and the \"Pan nonians\" (appar- ently Hungarians), by the quatrain, although Leoni (1982, 611)suggests an interpretation such that \"the prophecy was fulfilled in reverse\" and notes that some others have applied the quatrain to Hitler. Less torturously, Roberts (1949, 96) holds that \"it obvi- ously refers to an event and character inhis time now lost in the maze of history.\" None of the Nostradamians seems willing to accept the more obvious explanation that Nostradamus was a failed seer. When he says of the \"greatone\" that \"it will not be learned what will become of him,\" the prognosticator tacitly admits that he, too, is unable to see what the future holds!None of the Nostradamians seems willing to accept the more obvious explanation that Nostradamus was a failed seer. 14Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERWoodcut of the Great Fire of LondonSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/29/10 10:12 AM Page 146. Failed Prophecy of Persia. Here is one of Nostradamus's predictions, in quatrain III:77, that gives a specific Le roy de Perse par ceux d'Egypte prins: Conflict, I translate quatrain III:77 as follows: The third climate, under Aries' list- ing, October, seventeen twenty-seven, Those of Egypt capture the Persian King. Conflict, death, loss: the Cross dis- graced even. The second line of Nostradamus's astrological forecast is usually under- stood to give the date as \"1727 in October\" (Leoni 1982, 213; Robb1961, 59). However, LeVert (1979, 181), calling attention to the caesura(the mid-line pause common to qua-trains), observes that it could be read \"one thousand seven hundred [pause]twenty and seven in October,\" i.e.,Octo ber 27, 1700, but this seems over- reaching. 2 Whatever date in the eighteenth cen- tury is chosen, the prophecy is clearly a failed one. Some Nostradamians attemptto interpret the verse's \"those of Egypt\" as Turks who conquered Egypt in 1517, but as Leoni (1982, 614-15) observes,the Turks \"did not, by any stretch of the imagination, capture (or even defeat) the Persian ruler.\" Neither was any particularshame brought to Christendom. \"And if 'Egypt' is taken literally, there has been no war between Egypt and Persia since 1555 (or in fact since the 6th century BC), though there may well be one in the future.\" Leoni concludes that Nostrada -mus's prophecy is therefore \"a well-datedfailure\" (Leoni 1982, 615). 3 (Neither is this quatrain the only one with a dated prediction that has failed. Quatrain X:72 forecast, for the seventhmonth of the year 1999, the coming \"from the sky\" of a \"great King of Terror\" from a place called Angoulmois [Nostra - da mus 1555]. Whether the word is inter- preted as the French district Angoumois oras an the speci- fied events did not occur.) 7. The Invention and Flight of the Montgolfier Balloon. In quatrain V:57, Nostradamus (1557) wrote: the following translation: Going from Mount Gaussier and Aventine, Through the hole one notifies the army; Two rocks the booty is taken between, For Sext. Mausol. to lose celebrity. Some Nostradamians (e.g., Ionescu 1987) have interpreted the quatrain as predicting the invention of the Mont - golfier balloon, the hot-air craft used forthe first successful human flight in 1783. Stuart Robb (1961, 143) views it as \"one of the most amazing prophecies of the French seer.\" Supposedly, the quatrain specifically cites Montgaulfier [ sic]; the word trouor \"hole\" to the opening; and so on. Unfor tunately,Gaulfieris an obvious printer's error, a common misreading of the Middle- French long s(it resembles f), coupled with an early version of the name of a hill near Saint-Remy ( Gaulsier), actually spelled Gaussier.There, at the foot of Mount Gaussier, is a celebrated once-supposed \"mau- soleum\" (actually only a monument) of Sextus. (Hence, Nostradamus's \"Sext. mansol\" is obviously a reference with another printer's error: an inverted u having become an n.) Nearby are the deux rocz (\"two rocks\") and le trou (\"hole\") through the mountain thatNostrada mus surely refers to (see Leoni 1982, 266, 649; Randi 1993, 184).Therefore, the quatrain does not repre- sent a prophecy of balloon flight but isinstead a murky reference to someobscure incident\u2014real or imagined\u2014 from the boyhood of Nostra damus, who was born at Saint-Remy (see also Roberts1949, 164). Basically, the quatrain stateshow, once in the region, passage through \"the hole\" was effected to alert an army and a certain butin(plunder) taken between two rocks, causing the Sext[us] Mausol[eum] to lose its renown. 8-9.

However, beforethe terrorist attacks Nostradamians were offering non-terror-ist explanations. Roberts (1949, 96) inter- preted the first quatrain as saying, \"A cat- aclysmic fire shall engulf the greatest and newest of the world's big cities.\" Of the second, he said (1949, 328): \"This star- tling prophecy of a catastrophic event at apleasure resort not far from the great new city, predicts a tremendous tidal wave of poisoned waters that shall sweep in from the resort and overwhelm the man-mademountain-like skyscrapers of the city.\" Neither of these scenarios is compatible with a terrorist attack on New York, whether by nuclear means or not (Hogue 2003, xiii). Indeed, Nostradamus would seem to be speaking of Europe, at least in the first verse with its reference to \"theNormans.\" (In any case, New York City is not at forty-five degrees latitude but instead well under forty-one.) 10. The '2012' Predictions. Several of Nostradamus's quatrains supposedly anticipate the year 2012, the last year on the Mayan calendar (Hogue 1997). Twenty-twelvers believe that something portentous will occur then\u2014if not the end of the world, perhaps some New Awakening of Consciousness and blah, blah, blah. Quatrain II:62 has been men- tioned in this regard soif, faim, qu\u00e3d quatrain II:62: Mabus then afterwards will die; comes next A horrible defeat of men and beasts:All at once vengeance will be seen to vex. A comet's pass\u2014bloody hand, hunger, thirst. The word mabusis unidentified, but some Nostradamians believe it refers to Saddam Hussein, noting (incorrectly) that mabusspells sadamwhen held be - fore a mirror. (In fact it reads sudam\u2014 with the sand abackward [see Andrews and Andrews 2008].) A more likely pos- sibility is that the handwritten word was misread by the typesetter's reader, that it was actually malus, meaning \"the evil one.\" Also, the first word of the last line, cent(\"one hundred\"), is more likely the similar-sounding sang(\"blood\") (see LeVert 1979, 129). Nostradamus predicted many calami- ties\u2014often heralded by a comet, accord- ing to a superstition of his time. However, he did not make a doomsday prophecy, merely stating in a later preface that hisforecasts \"extend from now to the year 3797\" (qtd. in Leoni 1982, 127). Never -theless, Twenty-twelvers seem to be \"des- perately trying to find a way of decoding a 2012 prediction from Nostradamus'quatrains\" (Stray 2009, 268). * * * * As these examples show, one cannot claim that Nostradamus successfully pre- dicted the future. In his book The Occult Conceit, Owen Rachleff (1971, 138) characterized Nostradamus's proph e cies as \"exquisite examples of ambiguity, aid -ed by a keen sense of history.\" How ever, James Randi (1993, 223) did see the future regarding Nostradamus, predict- ing many years ago that his legend wouldsurvive: An ever-abundant number of inter- preters will pop up to renew the shabby exterior of his image, and that gloss will serve to entice more unwary fans into acceptance of the false predictions that have enthralled millions in the centuries since his death. Shame less rationaliza- tions will be made, ugly facts will be ignored and common sense will con- tinue to be submerged in enthusiasm. Amazing! Every word has come true!Notes 1. Since 1568, the original text's Deux classes vnehas been rewritten as Deux plaies une (\"Two wounds, one\") so that it would better fit King Henry's death in 1559. Actually, Nostradamus's classesmeans \"fleets\" everywhere else in the qua- trains (Leoni 1982, 576). 2.

Mediums are no longer whatthey used to be. They now contact \"enti- ties\" in daylight, without going into atrance, in front of hundreds of people and on television. Or so they claim. But at the turn of the ninetenth cen- tury, a s\u00e9ance could be a truly touching,emotional, and even scary experience.You were invited to someone's house,where a medium tried to contact your deceased loved ones. People sat around a table or held hands while the medium was enclosed in the spirit cabinet. Lights were lowered or extinguished, and thenthe wait began. In the dark, people could pray, sing spiritual anthems, orsimply breathe in unison and follow the medium's instructions. It might take ten minutes, half an hour, or even more time before anythinghappened. And the anticipation grew. Then, suddenly, you thought you were on another planet. You started hearing whispers, strange voices coming from afar. You heard steps around you, feltbreezes, and smelled scents. Maybe a feeble light flickered or moved around the room. It soon took the shape of a human form or a face. A ghost! Thestrange entity moved around the room, speaking to and touching participants. The table rocked, the medium levitated in the air, or flowers fell from the ceil- ing. Finally, everything turned quiet. The lights were turned up, and every- thing looked normal once again. It was all very spooky, especially if you did not know about the medium's unseen assistants, dressed in black and creating thephenomena occurring around the room. When we were approached by an Italian spirit medium who said he wan- ted CICAP (the Italian skeptics group)to test his \"powers,\" we agreed right away. He called himself \"Magus Math - eus Faust,\" but his real name was SignorTeodosio Lavinia, from the town of Potenza in southern Italy. He claimed hecould evoke spirits to move and shake any three-legged table. \"Table tipping\" had been a standard of s\u00e9ances, but hehad something new to offer: he claimedhe did not need to touch the table for it to move. It sounded interesting. 'This Room Is No Good!' RAI, an Italian TV network, somehow heard about this challenge and asked permission to film the test live. We plan- ned to conduct the experiment in thelaboratories of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pavia, where we had often conducted testing ofpsychic claimants. On the agreed-upon morning, the medium arrived quite early. He wantedto check the conditions of the test. Wehad searched for different kinds of three-NOTES ON A STRANGE WORLD M A S S I M O P O L I D O R O Massimo Polidoro is an investigator of the para- normal, lecturer , and co-founder and head of CICAP , the Italian skeptics group.

He examined each one of them carefully, lifting and touching them one by one. Finally, he chose one that he saidcould work for the test. But somethingwas wrong. \"There is a problem here,\" he said in a thick Southern Italian accent. \"What problem?\" we asked. \"The floor is no good!\" he said.He meant that it was not sufficiently smooth. The small cracks between thetiles might prevent the table from sli- ding. We suggested placing the table ontop of a large wooden platform. After we did so, he waved his hands on the table(Merlin style) a few times, examined the platform, and then shook his head. \"No good!\" he repeated. \"No good at all!\" The wood, he explained, stopped the \"spiritic fluid\" that apparently came fromunderground and needed direct contactwith the legs of the table. The table couldnot move under such conditions. When examining people claiming ps - ychic powers, it is important that testconditions are as favorable for the claim -ant as possible\u2014provided, of course,that they do not allow for misinterpreta- tions or trickery. This way, any possiblefailure cannot be attributed to unfavora- ble conditions or the skepticism of the experimenters. Patiently, we searched for another place to perform the test. The only appa- rently suitable room we could find without cracks between tiles was a cram- ped space under a staircase. Psychic, table,and crew moved to the new location, but alas, nothing could be done there either. \"Here's too gloomy,\" the medium said. \"I can't breathe in here!\" Back again to the original room, where the psychic said he could try to perform the test. \"Ok, much better now!\" he said, quite relieved. \"It will work here.\" He then felt confident of his success in the same place where he had earlier claimed it could not be done at all. The fact that the TV crew was growing impatient may have had something todo with his decision.The Table Tilts As we usually do before such tests, we asked the medium to give us an infor- mal demonstration. We wanted to be sure that his powers could work well in that particular room and that the lights, cameras, and people present would not affect his ability. In case of a failure under test conditions, those elements could not then be blamed as the possible source of the failure. He looked at us suspiciously at first but then agreed: \"OK, I can do this!\" He asked us to sit around the table and place the tips of our fingers on the surface of the table. He did the same. Suddenly, without even attempting to hide it, he started to push down on his side of the table, forcing it to tilt. \"What are you doing?\" we asked. \"You are pressing on the table!\" \"Ah! But you know nothing!\" he re - plied. \"I am not pressing. It is the fluid coming from my fingers that presses down.\" \"But you said you did not need to touch the table in order to move it,\" we reminded him. \"That is very difficult! I can only try that once, during the official test, not now.\" We did not argue any longer but instead put the table back in place and decided to start the actual test. Cameras rolling, we took our places around the table and put our fingers on it as before. After a few seconds, the medium started to moan and call for the spirits in his heavy accent. Oddly, he didn't do any of this during the trial test.He then placed his fingers on the surface of the table and pushed down. Again, the table tilted, but he added a new twist to the trick. When the table was incli- ned on two legs, he removed his handsand left it in this precarious position. Then it was apparent how he usually succeeded in this demonstration: he was going to claim that any movement cau-sed by us in the attempt to keep thetable still was actually produced by the fluid emanating from his hands, which he kept dramatically waving in the air. We decided we would not give him the chance to pull this on us in front of the camera. So we immediately put the table back on the floor and asked him to move it from that position; just a few millimeters would have been enough. The medium appeared to be shocked by this change in the program. He said he could try and appeared to concen-trate for a while. It took only a few minutes before he stopped and said that he had had enough. \"The spirits are a-gone! They don't like it in here,\" he said to explain his failure. Before the end of the filming, however, we explained to the TV viewers how the medium had really been able to incline the table by pressing on it. When his turn came to explain his failure and reply to our accusations, he merely shrugged his shoulders. \"It's their fault, not mine!\" he said. \"They lack the psychic energy!\" He was the medium, but if we want to see real psychic powers at work, we had better provide it ourselves. /hwysquareHe then felt confident of his success in the same place where he had earlier claimed it could not be done at all.

But thanks to a newly published draft sequence of our (kissing?) cousins'nuclear genome, we don't have Neander - tals to kick around anymore. In fact, one could argue\u2014as Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo, paleoge- neticist at the Max Planck Germany, and leader of thisproject recently has\u2014that Neandertalsaren't really extinct at all. Modern humans and Neandertals share a common ancestor that livedbetween 270,000 and 400,000 years ago, according to P\u00e4\u00e4bo's new estimate. Thisancestor lived in Europe and Asia\u2014onlyas far east as southern Siberia and only as far south as the Middle East. Fossil evi- dence suggests that modern humans andNeandertals encountered one another in some way in the Middle East from at least80,000 years ago, and then later in Europe. But, for reasons highly contested and yet unclear, Homo sapiens pressed onas Neandertals vanished from the recordaround 28,000 years ago. Bell chested and burly, with protrud- ing brow ridges and feeble chins, Nean - der tals suffer much abuse in the popular imagination. Traditionally they have been portrayed crudely as dullards because of their brutish appearance.Their reputation as one-trick ponies fol- lows their inability to survive either irregular climate circumstances or (alter- natively) the invasion of Cro-Magnon man during the late Pleistocene Epoch. But science has recently rehabilitated the Neandertal narrative. For whatever it's worth, their brains were probably as large as (or larger than) ours. Apparently gifted with symbolic thought, they deco-rated their bodies with jewelry and prob-ably pigment. They hunted ex pertly withstone points as well as implementscrafted from wood and bone. In 2007, Johannes Krause (also a member of P\u00e4\u00e4bo's team) reported that Nean dertalscarried FOXP2, the gene that allows humans to speak. And whatever the causes of their eventual passing may have been, Neandertals ruled Eurasia's volatile environs for more than 200,000 years\u2014longer than our species has existed. But the biggest news has just arrived. Neandertals, it turns out, are human\u2014 or at least a significant portion of most humans. In the May 7 issue of Science, P\u00e4\u00e4bo's international team of scientists published a draft sequence of the Nean -dertal genome composed of four billionnucleotides from three individuals.

But thanks to a newly published draft sequence of our (kissing?) cousins' nuclear genome, we don't 10:14 AM Page 19their great surprise, they discovered that between 1 and 4 percent of the modern, non-African human genome is derivedfrom our maligned and misunderstood relatives. In other words, Neander tals and modern humans interbred. This outcome stunned P\u00e4\u00e4boand his colleagues because previous analyses ofNeandertal mitochondrial DNA showedthat it consistently fell outside of the vari- ation found in contemporary humans. On the other hand, many paleoanthro- pologists rather expected these results. Milford Wolpoff of the Uni versity of Michigan and Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o of the Uni -versity of Bristol in England argue thatfossil evidence has long suggested inter- breeding. For example, the 24,000-year- oldLagar Velhochild, found in Portu gal in the late 1990s, presents a mixture of Neandertal and H. sapienstraits. P\u00e4\u00e4bo's team assembled the genome primarily using DNA from three Nean - dertal limb bones\u2014each from a separate female individual\u2014found in Vindija Cave, Croatia and dated at 38,000 to 44,000 years old. They confirmed the sequence with smaller samples from El Sidr\u00f3n, Spain; Neander Valley, Ger - many; and Mezmaiskaya, Russia\u2014none of which differed significantly from the Vindija specimens. By contrasting their results with the chimpanzee genome, P\u00e4\u00e4bo's team was able to distinguish ancestral genetic variants from their derived counterparts. To find out whether Neandertals are more closely related to some contempo- rary humans than to others, P\u00e4\u00e4bo then compared the derived Neandertal vari- ants to those contained in the genomes of five living humans\u2014a San from Southern Africa, a Yoruba from West Africa, a French European, a Papua New Guinean, and a Han Chinese. The San and Yoruba were deemed appropriate proxies for genetic diversity in Africa be - cause of their exceptionally ancient her- itage. If gene flow between Neandertals and H. sapiensoccurred prior to differ- entiation among human populations, P\u00e4\u00e4bo hypothesized, the Neandertal alleles would match those of individuals from some regions of the world more often than those of others. And the results revealed exactly that. After ruling out the ever-present possi- bility of contamination, the team con- cluded that \"Neandertals share signifi-cantly more derived alleles with non- Africans than with Africans.\" More specifically, Neandertals shared the same number of derived alleles with both the European and the Asians, but signifi- cantly more with either the European or the Asians than with either African. Notably, no Neandertal specimen has ever been found as far east as China or New Guinea. Thus, P\u00e4\u00e4bo inferred, because Nean - der tals are more closely related to all pre- sent-day non-Africans, and equally so, 20 Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 non-Africans must have interbred with their common ancestors shortly after they de parted from Africainto the Middle East but before their fur- ther migration into Eurasia. Such geneticexchange could have taken place about80,000 years ago when Neandertal re -mains began to show up in Israeli cavesalready occupied by humans (Qafzeh,Skhul, and Tabun, for example), or evenlater, about 50,000 to 60,000 years ago, when a second group of H. sapiens set out from Africa. Even so, the team wouldn'tcompletely exclude an alternative possibil-ity\u2014that their results might instead revealan \"old substructure\" in Africa that lastedfrom Neandertal origins until non-African migration. In any case, a prominent and long- standing debate in paleoanthropologyhas finally been resolved. The Nean - dertal genome does indeed live on inpresent-day humans. \"the most in - teresting development,\" P\u00e4\u00e4bo re cently told me, may be \"the identification ofgenes that were positively selected in humans after their divergence fromNeandertals.\" In other words, theNeandertal sequence has begun to revealsome of the recently evolved traits thatmake us uniquely human. But there were surprises lurking here too. Using the chimpanzee, orangutan,and rhesus macaque genomes in addi- tion to those of andNeandertals, the team located only sev-enty-eight recent nucleotide substitu-tions capable of altering the protein-cod-ing capacity of genes where moderns arefixed for a derived state and whereNeandertals bear the ancestral, morechimp-like version. And just five geneshad accumulated multiple substitu- tions\u2014a shockingly small number, given the ample span of time. Indeed, changesto human accelerated regions (HARs)\u2014conserved throughout most of vertebrate evolution but altered drastically duringhominin evolution\u2014tended to predate the human-Neandertal split. Even so, P\u00e4\u00e4bo was able to identify general roles, if not specific functions, associated with some of our newly altered genes. Three alleles carrying multiple sub- stitutions affect skin physiology, including TRPM1). Others mightpertain to cognitive development, muta- be impor- tant for gene metabo- sperm flagellum ( SPAG17). The team couldn't say, however, whether these specific substitutions were the result of random drift or positive selection. They also searched the modern human sequence for \"selective sweeps\"\u2014lengthy swaths of DNA in Nean dertal and chimp genomes. Extensive affected regions, the prevailing theory goes, imply relativelyintense selective pressures. Again throughgenomic comparisons, P\u00e4\u00e4bo successfully identified 212 such sweeps in the modern human genome, many surroundinggenes commonly thought to involve brain function in some way. The new Neandertal sequence is im - perfect to say the least. Although P\u00e4\u00e4bo's team decoded roughly 5.3 billion nucleo -tides in total\u2014the human genome con-tains about 3 billion\u2014much of that totalconsists of duplications. The team con- fesses as well that more than one-third ofthe genome remains unsequenced. P\u00e4\u00e4boexpects his fair share of criticism at some point, but he says it's a bit too early to expect serious reproaches from other sci-entists. The religious community re mains silent as well, which P\u00e4\u00e4bo finds some-what surprising. Meanwhile, science turns its collective gaze forward. P\u00e4\u00e4bo wants to improve thescreening process for positive selection and to follow up on specific candidategenes, the function of which may have been altered during recent human evolu-tion. He hopes as well to explore the Neandertal sequence more fully to iden- tify features unique to the species (or sub- species) and to illuminate Neandertal genetic variation by analyzing the remainsof additional specimens. Additionally, perhaps his team will scrutinize thegenomes of other extinct hominin forms to determine whether they, too, have con- tributed to the human blueprint. Regardless, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his colleagues have already advanced humanity's self- knowledge by meteoric leaps andbounds. We now have confirmation that the genomes of long-extinct hominins can be reliably salvaged. We know thatthe strictest \"out of Africa\" hypothesis ofhuman origins is untenable, and that theenvironment\u2014whether natural or man- made\u2014continues to shape the contours of our epic evolutionary adventure. Weshould appreciate as well that geneticrifts between modern human popula- tions can run quite deep indeed, and thus they can be ignored only at ourcommon peril. And hopefully we've gained a great deal more respect for our exceptionally intimate relatives, the Neandertals. Far from ugly, dim-witted, or incompetent,our \"sister group,\" as P\u00e4\u00e4bo's team has dubbed them, will have much to teachus in the coming years. But many of us can't really talk about Neandertals as \"them\" anymore because, in fact,Neandertals are \"us.\" SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October 2010 21/hwysquare /hwysquareIn any case, a prominent and long-standing debate in paleoanthropology has finally been resolved.

As Jonah Lehrer reminds us in hisNew York Times review of Carr's book (May 27, 2010), Socrates thought that books were a really bad idea, taking away from our ability to memorize and transmit oral traditions. And in the sev- enteenth century, Robert Burton com- plained of the chaos and confusion cre- ated by the availability of so manybooks. That was a full four centuries before Amazon.com. Of course, it is not difficult to come up with real life examples of people whose lives have, in fact, been signifi-cantly disrupted by the new technology. The New York Times published a long article (June 6, 2010) on the Campbell family of San Francisco. Mr. Campbell \"craves the stimulation he gets from hiselectronic gadgets. He forgets things likedinner plans, and he has trouble focus-ing on his family. ... He goes to sleep with a laptop or iPhone on his chest,and when he wakes, he goes online. ... When he rides the subway to San Francisco, he knows he will be offline [for] 221 seconds as the train goes through a tunnel.\" Mrs. Campbell \"makes breakfast and watches a TVnews feed in the corner of the computer screen while [Mr. Campbell] uses the rest of the monitor to check his e-mail.\" Okay, that really does call for medical intervention, but contrary to the New York Times commentary, this isn't \"your brain on computers\"; it's the Campbells' brains on computers. What makes current complaints about the Internet something more than the latest Luddite rant is that they ap - pear to be based on science, not just anecdotal evidence. Carr, for instance, Massimo Pigliucci is professor of philosophy at the City University of New York-Lehman College, a fellow of the American Association for the Advance ment of Science, and author of Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk. His essays can be found at www.ratio- nallyspeaking.org.The Internet Is Really Bad\u2014Or Is It? Socrates thought that books were a really bad idea, taking away from our ability to memorize and trans- mit oral traditions.

The allegation is that the Internet is making all of us read the same stuff, but a more sensible interpretation would be that scientists tend to cite more recent works because they focus on the latest ad - vances, not on the history of the field. In fact, the availability of online databases of journal articles and books that go back many decades makes it possible forus to look at a much larger chunk of theliterature in a much shorter period oftime than ever before. Perhaps the most compelling re - search so far on the dangers of multi- tasking with new technologies is the onethat The New York Times uses as the basis for a test (which, apparently with-out irony, you can take online at http://nyti.ms/axA8qk) that measures your ability to focus and juggle tasks. Itook the test because I was somewhat skeptical of the claims. The idea is tocompare how well you do with two experimental groups: so-called low and high multitaskers. The latter are the Internet-damaged poor devils who can't focus and only fool themselves into thinking they are multitasking. Even though I'm a high multitasker and a heavy user of the Internet (and of my Droid and Kindle), I actually scored better than the average low multitaskers (the control group) and easily crushed the high multitaskers. This is, of course, anecdotal evidence based on a sample size of one, but what are the chances that I am beyond the nintey-ninth per- centile in this regard? The reality is that we don't know much about what the Internet is doing to our brains. It is certainly affecting them because anything we do affects our brains, particularly when it comes to intellectual activities. But the available research is a mixed bag, showing both potential prob- lems, at least for some people, and some definite gains (e.g., in cognitive tasksranging from visual perception to\u2014sur- prisingly\u2014sustained at tention). We should pay close attention to what science has to say about all aspects of our lives, but I was struck by the sudden spate of doomsday scenarios that cite science to support them while curiously neglecting the considerable amount of science thatreaches different conclusions. In the end, of course, new technol- ogy will turn out to be a mixed blessing, just like Socrates feared. And, as usual, the problem is not the technology itself but how we use it. My new apartment in New York is entirely physical-book free, a situation that will probably horrify many readers. Yet I have tripled the number of books I read since I moved to the Kindle\u2014not an insignificant posi-tive result, especially when coupled with the much better use of my small cityabode and lower carbon footprint of my paper-free surroundings. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October 2010 23/hwysquare pgs_SI MJ partici- pating in science-education out-reach, I often encounter beliefs and questions about UFOs, extraterres-trials, and other unusual subjects. How -ever, until recently, never before had Iencountered such a well-organized, ded-icated, but ultimately clueless group of UFO watchers as those who turned up at one monthly public star party con-ducted by the San Diego AstronomyAssociation just outside the Fleet ScienceCenter in San Diego's Balboa Park. Five young adult men, joined later by severalwomen, were showing off their new nightvision binoculars and cameras while ask- ing all manner of questions about tele-scopes. It turns out that they were partic-ipating in one of UFOlogy's latest fads:using pricey high-technology night visionequipment to reveal things that the naked eye doesn't see\u2014and calling what they don't understand \"UFOs.\" They were inspired by claims they had heard from a number of sources, including Coast to Coast AM, the well- known late-night paranormal and con- spiracy-fest radio show hosted by George Noory (see http://tinyurl.com/3465no3,http://tinyurl.com/mqbfpq, and http://tinyurl.com/283pj29, which seem to show a bright satellite passing). The night vision equipment reveals objects that are too faint to be seen by the unaided eye. If you see something you can't identify, thenit must be a UFO. Sometimes the men pointed a powerful green laser at such objects so others can try to see them. Iwarned them that if you are pointing a laser at an aerial object and you don't know what it is, you might be shining itinto the cockpit of an aircraft. The pointwas appreciated. When it was my turn to look through the night vision binoculars (which I believe sell for approximately $2,500), Iwas astonished at how much I could see. Standing under the light-polluted urban skies, with many nearby streetlights and a marine layer developing (that's \"fog\" toyou non-Cali fornians), one could hardlysee stars fainter than about magnitude two (the stars in the Big Dipper). But using the night vision device, which inter-estingly did not magnify objects but sim- ply amplified light, I could easily see all of the stars in the sickle of Leo and the faint stars of Ursa Major as if I were out under dark skies in the country. Sud denly, a very bright white object dashed through my field of view, covering the distance from zenith to about 20 degrees elevation in a few seconds. A flying saucer? But it banked and turned back in my direction, and I could detect the flapping of wings. An owl had been spotted several times cir- cling the lighted buildings nearby. Whenthat owl flew directly over us, it was too dark to be seen with the naked eye, butthe goggles easily picked it up. I was told that the group had captured Robert Sheaffer's \"Psychic Vibrations\" column has appeared in the S KEPTICAL INQUIRER for the past thirty years.

How -ever, none of the video clips they showed me on their camera confirmed this claim. They did show a clip of two satellites traveling side-by-side in tandem. I ex -plained that they had very likely cap- tured one of the clusters of the NavalOcean Surveillance System satellites (see www.satobs.org/noss.html). The U.S. Navy operates several clusters of two or three satellites that maintain a strict for-mation and are apparently used to pin- point the source of radio and radartransmissions. Normally they are too faint to be easily seen by the unaided eye, although occasionally the sun angle brightens them to naked-eye visibility. When UFO seekers stumble across one of these clusters using optical magnifica- tion or amplification, they often con- clude that they have discovered a forma- tion of UFOs. Tim Printy has some interesting arti- cles on night vision UFOlogy in his Web 'zine (see http://home.com- Ed Grimsley claims tohave recorded \"space battles\" of UFOs in which there are as many as forty-five \"kills\" in one battle, which he is sellingon DVDs. \"Whoever it is we are bat- tling, it is very serious and a threat to our National Security,\" Grimsley warns on his Web site. In fact, Grimsley claimsto have been watching UFOs battling it out in the sky since he was a boy in 1961. Printy counters that it is \"aston-ishing in that no astronomical telescopes or astronomers (professional or ama- teur) have seen these events even thoughGrimsley was able to see them with his unaided eye before he obtained his night vision goggles.\" Printy continues, \"Amateur and pro- fessional astronomers have been monitor- ing the skies with equipment far superior to what Grimsley is using for many years. For instance, you can read [online articles that describe the astronomers' photo- graphic sky survey programs]. ... These articles have been written in the past decade but the footnotes demonstrate that people have been doing this kind of work for some time. Does Mr. Grimsleyseriously believe that all of these astronomers are not seeing this or, is it possible that these astronomers see whathe sees and can readily identify them?\" The night vision UFOlogists I en - countered wanted to buy a telescope, and they were apparently willing to spend $1,000 or more on it to get close-upvideos of these objects. They were think- ing about getting a Cassegranian reflect-ing telescope as large as eight inches in diameter, which can easily deliver a useful magnification of at least 400x. (Cheap telescopes sold in department stores often lure the unsophisticated with promises of magnifications of 600x or more. How - ever, although any telescope can theoreti- cally achieve any magnification if you throw enough doubling lenses onto it,the image quality is so poor it is useless.) The group would then demonstrate theexistence of secret, off-the-record surveil-lance satellites or even actual extraterres- trial vehicles. After all, didn't some ama-teur photographers capture the Inter -national Space Station (ISS) clearlyenough to reveal its shape? Yes, that's true, I explained. But there exists soft-ware to track Earth satellites using a tele- scope with a go-to mount, and the objects that you want to image are onunknown paths, so they must be trackedmanually. The greater the magnification, the smaller the field of view and, hence, the more difficulty there is in tracking. I suggested they look into a small, wide-angle telescope of three or four inches diameter or, better yet, large binoculars in which one side is for the observer whotracks and the other is for the camera. However, even if there were some- thing spooky up there to track, thisapproach is unlikely to yield high-reso-lution images. Night vision optics trade sensitivity for resolution, and bright objects spill out into a circle of light that in no way reflects their angular size. A good pair of binoculars will reveal fainter objects than night vision coun- terparts, albeit with a smaller field ofview but with much better resolution.There's nothing in the sky that a night vision device can see that I can't also see in my 10x 50 binoculars, and I can see details much more clearly. But now that the fad for imaging UFOs in night vision has started and sophisticatedequipment is being used eagerly by the unsophisticated, we can look forward to many more UFO claims from perfectly sincere persons who do not have a clear idea of what can be seen in the sky. * * * Spiral UFOs strike again! On December 9, 2009, news organizations worldwidereported sightings of a \"mysterious giantspiral of light\" over Norway (see my\"Psychic Vibrations\" column, SI, March/ April 2010). Despite breathless specula-tion along the lines of \"the space specta-cle is an entirely new astral phenome- SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October 2010 25 SI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:41 PM Page 2526 Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERnon,\" the object turned out to be a Russian Bulava missile spinning while venting propellant, much like a spinning garden sprinkler. On the morning of June 5, 2010, at approximately 5:50 AMlocal time, many observers in eastern Australia reportedseeing a \"strange spiral light\" moving across the sky, and several captured it on video. James Butcher of Canberra toldAustralian Broadcasting, \"It had a dis- tinct bright centre, much like a bright star, indicating an object shedding lighttrails, spiralling and fattening out from it.The effect lasted only two or three min-utes, moving and descending quick ly out of view\" (see http://tinyurl.com/Aussie Spiral). UFO enthusiasts on Web sites such as abovetopsecret.com quickly spunfar-out explanations of what it might be, such as activity from \"Australia's area 51.\" But the Bad Astronomer, Phil Plait, got right on it. In a posting on his BadAstronomy blog titled \"Oh, Those FalconUFOs,\" Plait explained that as soon as he saw the Australian videos, he was reminded of the Norway spiral from last December and surmised that it was prob-ably a rocket booster venting excess pro-pellant (see http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/05/oh- those-falcon-ufos/). He ob tained theground track of a satellite launched from Cape Canaveral on the same day (the SpaceX Falcon 9), which placed the ob - ject right over eastern Australia at the time of the sightings. However, Doug Moffett of UFO Research NSW wasn't buying any of that \"rocket which translates to 4.45am [Australian] EST, the duration of the flight was 9 min- utes 38 seconds\u2014this is a full hour before the reported sightings.\" Plait countered, \"This isn't a starship, it's a rocket, and takes time to go aroundthe Earth. An orbit is usually 90 minutes in period, so it takes about 45 minutes orso to get from Florida to Australia. Plus, since this was a launch it wasn't moving at top speed the whole time; it took a few minutes to accelerate to orbital speeds. That makes the timing about perfect.\" Moffet's next objection was, \"Where was the glow from the boosters or from the friction created by the craft moving through the atmosphere, where was the tail of the rocket?\" Plait responded, \"The Falcon 9 was up and outside the atmosphere in the first few minutes of flight, when it was barely over the Atlantic! So by the time it was passing over Australia it would'vebeen a couple of hundred kilometers up.\" Then Moffett, who seems not to understand the concept of \"orbit,\" asked, \"Why would anyone launch a rocket on a maiden test flight with a trajectory that would take it over the most heavily pop- ulated parts of Australia?\" Plait responded, \"If the rocket failed, it would have done so over the Atlantic. That's why we launch rockets from Flor - ida in the first place!\" If the rocket made it as far as Australia, it did so because it was safely in Earth orbit. And finally, Moffett speculated, \"How big must this rocket have been to be seen so clearly, at the same time, oversuch a vast distance?\" Plait replied, \"Anyone familiar with the sky knows that satellites are easy tospot with just your [naked] eye. Rockets can be even easier, especially when they're spewing out gas! This is some- thing I've been saying for years: if you know what you're looking at in thesky\u2014meteors, satellites, planets, and soon\u2014a lot of UFO stories evaporate. The fact that so many reported UFOs turn out to be mundane objects is a pretty good sign that more than a few UFOenthusiasts aren't terribly familiar withobserving the sky.\" The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and the S KEPTICALINQUIRER magazine have created one more way for readers to keep up with news and events.

From what I gather, 9/11 Truthers believe that the Sep tem ber 11 terrorist attacks were an inside job bythe U.S. government\u2014and some scien-tists support their claims. Is this true? \u2014F. Nocedal A:Perhaps no event in the past few decades has spawned more conspiracytheories than the September 11, 2001,terrorist attacks. The confusion andchaos of the event bred myths and mis- information that remain long after the toxic dust settled over Manhattan. Some stories were outright hoaxes, such as theinfamous photo of a doomed tourist taken atop one of the World Trade Cen - ter towers just before a plane hit. Some were well-intentioned myths about the terrorists and their victims. In the ab - sence of clear and immediate answers, wild speculation ran rampant, and con- spiracy theorists inevitably latched onto the biggest conspiracy since the Kennedy assassination or the Roswell crash. The evidence that the terrorist at - tacks were indeed the result of a con- spiracy is overwhelming. There's no doubt about it: a close (or even cursory) look at the evidence makes it clear that the attacks were carefully planned andexecuted by conspirators. The question, of course, is who those conspirators were. Osama bin Laden and the crew of (mostly Saudi Arabian) hijackers were part of the conspiracy, but what about President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney? Did top Bush advisors, includ- ing Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rums - feld, collaborate with bin Laden or in - tentionally allow the attacks to happen? Put another way, was it an inside job? Groups such as the 9/11 Truthers be - lieve it was and point to a catalog of sup-posed inconsistencies in the \"official ver- sion\" of the attacks, often based on real or perceived \"anomalies.\" Many of the technical conspiracy claims were de - bunked by Popular Mechanics magazine in March 2005, while other claims are refuted by simple logic: If a hijacked air- plane did notcrash into the Pentagon, as is often claimed, then where is Flight 77 and its passengers? Are they on ice with the Roswell aliens at Hangar 18? The claims of 9/11 Truthers are far too varied and detailed to go into here, but CSI Fellow Dave Thomas recently described his experience debating a 9/11 Truther in our December 2009 Skeptical Briefsnews letter. Thomas notes: None of the 9/11 Truth claims really hold up under scrutiny. For example, regarding the Twin Towers' collapse, [California architect Richard] Gageoften uses a demonstration using three cardboard boxes to make his point.... In fact, it is an excellent example of pseudoscience. What's actually relevant here is load vs. struc- ture: the fact that dynamicloads are not the same as static loads.... Once the top floors of the towers fell evenone floor's height, the horrifying \"piledriver\" collapse became in evit - able. I showed how WTC 7 had been severely damaged by debris from Tower 1 and showed evidence (rou- tinely ignored by \"Truthers\") of thesevere fires that burned for many hours in Tower 7. Thomas cautions, \"Don't smugly as - sume this conspiracy is confined to the lunatic fringe. After years of polishing and refinement, 9/11 Truth efforts have per- suaded many citizens, including some ofmy relatives and close friends, to considerthe attacks an 'inside job.'\" In many con- spiracy theories, bureaucratic incompe-tence is mistaken for conspiracy. Our gov-ernment is so efficient, knowledgeable,and capable\u2014so the reasoning goes\u2014that it could not possibly have botched the job so badly in detecting the plot ahead of time or responding to the attacks. I'm skeptical. /hwysquare Note: The S KEPTICALINQUIRERwill have more on the September 11 conspiracy claims in a future issue.The Truth about the 9/11 Truthers SI 7/22/10 4:41 PM Page 27Persi Diaconis phoned me on May 17, 2010. He told me he recently spoke with Martin Gardner by phone. Among other things, they had talked about me. He also said that Martin sounded fine and seemed to be as cognitively sharp asalways. I had not spoken with Martin for quite a while. I made a note on my calendar to call him on Saturday, May 22. On that Saturday, I was about to call Martin when I got a phone call from Martin's son, James. James told me thathis father had passed away a few momentsearlier. Many persons\u2014too many\u2014would seek mystical meaning in this \"coinci- dence.\" Martin, of course, devoted much of his life to teaching us how eas- ily our minds create meaning out of post hoc juxtapositions of random events.Although he thought that most believerswere impervious to reason, he perse- vered in his quest to show that most, if not all, paranormal claims cannot besupported by the evidence. He felt that his background as a magician enabled him to explain how many alleged psy- chic occurrences were due to trickery or mundane causes. I first met Martin in 1950 at the home of Bruce Elliot in Greenwich Village in New York. Bruce published amagazine on magic, The Phoenix, and wrote several books about magic. EverySaturday he hosted a gathering for magi- cians from New York or who happened to be in the vicinity. I was twenty-one years old when I was invited to attend. This was the first time I met many celebrity magicians such as Dai Vernon, Jay Marshall, and Martin Gardner. Martin and I became good friends. I knew him as a magician, a creator of magic effects, and a writer of excellent books on magic. In addition, we shared an interest in investigating and challeng- ing paranormal claims. Soon after our first meeting, Martin published his classicIn the Name of Science (1952). The book was re-issued in 1957, with some updat- ing, under the title Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. It serves as the proto- type for modern skeptical criticism. From 1958 to 1961, while I was doing psychological research for General Elec -tric, I lived in Hartsdale, about twenty- five miles from Martin Gardner's home on Euclid Avenue in Hastings-on-the- Hudson, New York. During this periodmy wife and I would get together withMartin and his wife, Charlotte, for din- ner. I also was able to visit and talk withhim about our mutual interests. When I moved to Oregon in 1961 to work at the University of Oregon, Martin phoned Jerry Andrus and told him I had moved into his neighborhood. He sug- gested that Jerry contact me. Jerry did and we became close friends until Jerry's unfortunate death in August 2007. Martinand Jerry are the two most impressive indi- viduals I have everknown. Both were es -sentially self-taught magic, philosophy, sci-ence, and other areas.Martin Gardner: A Polymath to the Nth Power RAY HYMAN A Tribute and Celebration MARTIN GARDNER 1914\u20142010 Martin Gardner, the polymath writer, critic, and skeptic who is widely regarded as the father of modern skepticism, died May 22, 2010, in Norman, Oklahoma, at the age of ninety-five. He helped found our Com mittee for Skeptical Inquiry (then CSICOP) and wrote for this magazine since its inception. (His final \"Notes of a Fringe Watcher\"column appears on page 10.) Throughout his life, Gardner wrote knowledgeably about an astonish- ing range of topics with a combination of clarity, wit, and critical intelligence that delighted readers worldwide. Those who knew him regarded him as a dear friend, a modest man, and a national intel- lectual treasure. In a celebration of his life, writings,and mind, we here present invited tributes from a number of noted skeptics and scholars. We begin with two of his closest friends and colleagues, Ray Hyman and James Randi. Like him, they were found- ing fellows of CSICOP and original and longtime members of its executive council. \u2014The Editor 28 Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:41 PM Page 28You can gain some insights into the range and impact of Martin's productive life by reading the many obituaries thathave appeared online. In the remainingfew lines at my disposal, I will discuss only a couple of my many personal sto- ries involving this Renaissance man. I have always been interested in how productive individuals organize theirlives and manage their data. Soon after Martin's operation for cataracts, I askedhim how he managed to read and reviewso many books while continuing his pro -digious literary output and maintaining a colossal correspondence. Martin told me that, in most cases, he did not actu- ally read the books he reviewed. Instead,he simply scanned the index, which pro- vided all the information he needed forhis review. I was incredulous at first, but on sec- ond thought I realized that this was con-sistent with my research on informationtheory and redundancy. I had already discovered that I could scan the indices of textbooks in statistics, perception, and cognitive psychology and know all I needed to know about how the bookhandled its topic. For example, by not- ing the topics the author listed and, more importantly, the ones she did not,I could confidently guess her stance on various issues. This was because I already knew these areas quite well. Martin's ability to exploit redundancy induced me to conduct research on speed reading. I discovered that gradu-ates from speed reading classes who claim to be reading 1,000 or more words per minute are actually skipping over large chunks of text by exploiting redundancy. When they are given text to read from domains with which they are unfamiliar, their reading drops to the same speed as those who have never taken a special course. Martin not only wrote the seminal textbook for the modern skeptical movement, but he was also central to the actual founding of the movement. In December 1972, I was sent by the De fense Department to observe Uri Geller and the researchers at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). My report, which I shared with Martin,made it clear that nothing that this alleged psychic did had anything to do with the paranormal. Soon after that, Randi observed Geller at the offices of Timemagazine in New York. He, too, saw through Geller's pretensions. In 1973, Randi phoned me from Port - land, Oregon. He was touring with Alice Cooper and asked me to travel from Eugene to Portland to meet him. While I was in Portland, Randi reviewed our experiences with Geller and suggestedthat we get together with Martin Gardner and form a group to counter false claimsof the paranormal. He suggested we callthe group SIR (Sanity in Research), whichevoked the acronym SRI. Randi and I soon afterwards spent a day with Martin at his home in Hastings-on-Hudson preparing a detailed docu- ment of the goals and hopes for our new group. In 1976, SIR joined forces with Paul Kurtz, who was already publishingskeptical articles in The Humanist ,which he edited at that time. The resulting orga-nization became known as CSICOP (now CSI), and the contemporary skepti-cal movement was born. Ray Hyman is emeritus professor of psychol- ogy at the University of Oregon. An expert in the psychology of self-deception, he is a founding fellow of CSICOP and founding member of the CSICOP executive council. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October 2010 29 SI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:41 PM Page 2930 Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERWhere to begin? I've really no idea where or exactly when I first met Martin Gardner. I believe our first meetingoccurred in the offices of Scientific American magazine more than six decades ago, but it seems that I havealways known him. He became such afixture in my life, such a dependable part of my world. I was so very accus- tomed to picking up the telephone tocall him or answering a call from himthat always resulted in an improvementof my knowledge of the universe. Traveling the world, as I have done most of my life, I've found that some academics doubt that I actually knew this legendary figure in person. I recallthat when I delivered a lecture to the sys- tems engineers of IBM many years ago, a talk during which I referred to Martin, I was besieged by a group from the audi- ence who asked me to settle whether Martin was an actual individual or per- haps an amalgamation of Isaac Asimov,Arthur C. Clarke, and maybe a magician colleague of mine, since his writings so frequently touched on the sort of exper- tise that only such a trio could summonup. They were appropriately amazed and edified when I assured them that thisparagon was actually a single person, a real human being who was quite as accomplished as he ap peared to be. Another matter on which I was queried from time to time was whether or not Martin actually had academic degrees in mathematics\u2014which he did not. As he once ex -pressed it to me, afterbeginning his columnin Scientific American (SA), he sort of learnedit as he went along.And I must say that I believe that was true. He always ex pressed his delight at somethingthat he had just stum- bled upon or that hadoccurred to his agilemind as he applied it to a problem at hand. Indeed, \"delight\" was amajor characteristic ofthis man's makeup.That enthusiasm cer-tainly carried over into his books and his SAcolumn. He was con-stantly celebrating dis- coveries, expanding on them, and looking for new ways to communi- cate them to the public\u2014and especially to young people. He was never happier than when he was in the company of kids to whom he would present a brain teaser,followed by the \"Aha!\" phase in which he would provide an answer\u2014usually totally unexpected\u2014that made everything quite clear. That lucidity of his work made him a great teacher. His weaving of a storymight have been inspired by his totaladmiration for the Alice stories by Lewis Carroll. He pored over every sentence that Carroll had constructed and ex - tracted from them every sort of nuance he could, and of course he recorded his observations in writing\u2014to the delight of his many, many fans over the years and around the globe. Martin's spectrum of interest was very broad. His coterie of friends included major professional magi-cians, mathematicians of every sort, philosophers, a few scoundrels, and a suf-ficient variety of weirdos to round out his perception of the world. As an atheist myself, I admit that I was somewhat sur- prised that this man was a deist. When I inquired about this apparent lapse of logic, he calmly informed me that he was well aware the atheists had a much better argument than he did and that in fact he had no supporting evidence for his accep-tance of a deity. It simply made him \"feelmore comfortable,\" and knowing Martin as I did, I merely accepted that fact and somewhat celebrated it. Anything thatimproved Martin's life improved mine. At our next Amaz!ng Meeting in July, we of the James Randi Educational Foun -dation will certainly not hold any sort of memorial to Martin Gardner. That would have embarrassed him hugely, I'm quite sure. His son Jim, calling me to announce his father's demise, added that the will he left behind specified that there be no funeral and that cremation would be pre- ferred. That's my Martin, and I expected no less. No, at the July conference we will celebrate the existence of this fine gentle-man, one of my giants, a huge intellect, a prolific author, and a caring, responsible, citizen of the world. If we can manage it,we'll have balloons and dancing girls\u2014which would have titillated Mr. Gardner, I guarantee you. Yes, he's gone away, but his wise words and his great love for reason and compas-sion will remain with us forever. I loved him dearly, but I leave him to the ages. Magician, investigator, and writer James Randi is founder of the James Randi Educational Foundation.

Perhaps his reputation in thelong run will dependon the provocativebooks that he au -thored over the years.Al though we may beat \"the beginning ofthe end of the Age ofBooks\" (alas!), Gard -ner stands out as a heroic author whose books on pseudo-science we hope will be read in the futurewith relish and delight\u2014as reminders ofhow easy it is to be deceived. I know Martin Gardner best as a book author; Prometheus Books published atleast twenty-five of his books. Several of these were new editions of books previ-ously published. I founded Pro metheusin 1969, and it has devoted more atten-tion than any other press to publishingbooks on scientific skepticism and theparanormal. Martin was tickled pink thatPrometheus Books was willing to take onthe paranormalists. I first got to know Martin when I founded the modern skeptics movement (in the guise of CSICOP, later CSI), so to speak, and invited him to the inau- gural meeting at the State University ofNew York at Buffalo on April 30, 1976. I was delighted when he accepted and even more so when he appeared. His publishing romance with Prometheusbegan a few years later. He shared with us a devotion to books\u2014the idea thatbooks should be cherished as virtually \"sacred\" because of their enduring con-tributions to culture. Martin's first book with Prometheus was Science: Good, Bad and Bogus (1981). The New York Times described it as \"a valuable book ... an ally of com-mon sense.\" It was a nominee for a national book award. So his career with Prometheus got off to a rousing start. We would hear from him almost biweekly thereafter, as he kept proposing books and then saw them through the editorial process until publication. Martin had a keen intelligence and a sharp wit, which he used with consummate skill. We were intrigued with the titles that he came up with, such as On the Wild Side(hardcover 1992, paperback 2004), which dealt with the big bang, ESP, the Beast 666, levitation, rainmaking, trance-channeling, s\u00e9ances, ghosts, and more. Another one was How Not to Test a Psychic (1989). (Incidentally, the com- plete list of Martin Gardner's books still available from Prometheus Books may be read online.) It was amazing to me how Martin was able to delve into what many con- sidered nutty claims. He took them seri- ously and made them seem even nuttier,such as in his book Urantia: The Great Cult Mystery(1995, revised 2008). Martin told me that he maintained extensive clip- pings on a wide range of topics and so could bring empirical facts to bear toexpose the beliefs held. An important book by Martin was Great Essays in Science (1994), which includ ed thirty-one of some of the best writ-ings in science over thepast 100 years. accomplish- ments in science. Prometheus also published a novel by Martin called The Flight of Peter Fromm (1994), which seemed to echo his own religious beliefs. I was curious that Martin himself clung to his religious faith in God, somewhat apologetically. \"I can't proveit,\" he seemed to say, \"but I am attachedto it.\" I found this statement rather charming, if only because it contradictsdoctrinaire atheists who insist that anytrue skeptic must be an atheist. Gardner's last new book with Prome - theus was The Jinn from Hyperspace and Other Scribblings\u2014Both Serious and Whimsical (2007). New Scientist re - viewed the book bystating that it was\"clear, closely argued,and entertaining . .. a fascinating insight in to the breadth ofin terest and fecun- dity of the man now in his nineties.\" To which I say amen about all of Gardner's books, an inexhaustible treasury of insight andwisdom. Martin Gardner played a key role in his time as a keen advocate of sci-ence, a luminary in the constellation ofskeptics. He will be sorely missed.

I knew of him, of course, as the \"Mathematical Games\" columnist in Sci - entific American and as author of the seminal work about pseudoscience and crackpots, Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. I'd had a copy of that fascinat- ing book since a friend gave it to me as agift in graduate school. I loved it.Mar - tin's letter gently but firmly criticized us for a series of three articles we had run over a period of months dealing with some fringe science matters: Uri Geller, Kirlian photography, and TranscendentalMeditation. Readers had requested the articles. This was the heyday of Geller's then-rising popularity, and Geller hadsome (naive) scientists vouching for hispowers. The other two subjects were like- wise attracting a lot of media and popu- lar interest. We had done our best to treat them carefully and with some skepti- cism, but except for the one on Geller, Martin didn't think we'd done a particu- larly good job and was worried we'dput aside our usual scientific standards by writing about them at all. I wasn't at all offended by his criti- cism; in fact, I welcomed it. I wrote him back. I told him science writers and edi- tors like me had few resources for check-ing the validity of these kinds of claims. I told him we needed people like him who 32 Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERMARTIN GARDNER It takes a special kind of person to write insightfully about quantum mechanics and mathematics\u2014 and literature andreli- gion andpseudoscience andconjuring andphilosophy. And it takes a very special kind of person to be able to do so in a waythat is comprehensible, enlightening,entertaining to the intelligent layperson,and worthy of the respect of experts. Sucha rare person was Martin Gardner, and hisachievements are all the more impressivegiven that he was largely self-taught and without advanced degrees in physics,mathematics, literature, or philosophy. I knew Martin Gardner the icon rather well, and I owe him a considerable debtfor what I have learned from him over theyears. When I was an undergraduatephysics student, my classmates and Iavidly devoured his \"MathematicalGames\" column in Scien tific American, along with his published collections ofmathematical puzzles and enigmas andhis other books on science and mathe-matics. He helped make mathematics andphysics delightful to pursue. Later on,when I switched disciplines and became agraduate student in psychology, I turnedto his writings once again when I wasasked\u2014nay, virtually ordered\u2014by thedepartment chair to prepare a criticalexamination of extrasensory perception(ESP) for presentation to undergraduatestudents who were clamoring for such atalk. I knew nothing of the subject at thetime; so where was I to begin, given theapparent paucity of critical literature onthe subject? I dug out Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science and let Martin intro- duce me to the subject. That simple beginning unexpectedly led me into decades of critical commentary and debate with regard to parapsychology. Later on, as a young psychology pro- fessor, I was researching how people maintain their beliefs in the face of con-tradictory evidence. I wanted a demon-stration that would confront subjects withostensible evidence that something theyheld to be absolutely true was apparentlyfalse. Where to begin? I turned to MartinGardner once again: I began re-readingsome of his books and articles and sooncame across the perfect vehicle for my research\u2014a puzzle, invented a centuryearlier by Sam Lloyd but preserved andanalyzed by Gardner, in which a piece ofpaper of a certain area, when cut into pieces and the pieces rearranged, appearsquite clearly to have gained in area. This was ideal for my purpose, for psycholo- gists had long believed that all of us acquire in childhood a firm belief in \"con- servation of area,\" so that we \"know\" that area cannot be changed by the re arrange -ment of component parts. I had always been very impressed by Martin Gardner the icon, but I was fortu-nate enough to be able to meet Martin Gardner the man. This came about when I was made a member of the CSICOPexecutive council. With this ap point -ment, I was delighted that I would rub shoulders with the man himself, for he was one of the founders of CSICOP and a member of its executive council. I soon learned, however, that he was averse totravel and did not usually attend council meetings. I therefore had to wait to meet him until a meeting was held in Atlanta, which was near enough to his home at the time that he did indeed attend. Martin the man proved to be as impressive asMartin the icon. He was gentle, intelli- gent, witty, modest, curious, and filled with creative energy and imagination. A longtime fan such as I could not avoid feeling a little star-struck, although it was very clear that stardom was the last thing that he wanted. I remember our first con- versation very well: he was a major con- tributor to the conjuring literature, and when he learned that I was an amateurmagician, he im mediately and graciouslyresponded by sharing with me a new magical effect that he had just invented. I was struck by his warmth, his lack of pre- tense, and his excitement about sharingnew ideas. As I reminisce, I see that Martin has had an important influence on me\u2014as he no doubt has had upon countless others who have been devoted to his scholar- ship\u2014for a very long time. Whether as Martin the icon or Martin the man, he hasenriched our lives. We shall all miss him. James Alcock is professor of psychology at Glendon College, York University, Toronto, and author of such books as Parapsy chology: Science or Magic?

A World Treasure KENDRICK FRAZIERWe Have Lost an Icon JAMES ALCOCKSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:41 PM Page 32had the necessary critical perspective and information to help us. Some sort ofgroup of scientific experts was needed to give us that kind of help. So it was perhaps not surprising that in the spring of 1976 I found myself covering for Science Newsan unusual conference on \"The New Irrationalisms: Pseudo scienceand Anti-Science\" at the brand new SUNY Buffalo campus, at which philoso- pher Paul Kurtz an nounced the creationof the Com mittee for the ScientificInvestigation of Claims of the Para - normal. It was exactly what I had asked for. My subsequent article for Science News\u2014our cover pictured a small knight- like skeptic with only a sword of reason challenging a giant multi-headed dragon of pseudoscience (May 29, 1976)\u2014stim- ulated more reader response than any other subject we had ever written about,which told me that this was a rich topicmeriting much further examination. Thenicest and most unexpected letter I re -ceived\u2014I just now rediscovered it in my archives of those early events\u2014was fromMartin Gardner. He thanked me for thearticle, praised its accuracy, and called it a\"wind of fresh air, long overdue.\" One year later I was an invited guest and speaker at the first meeting of theCSICOP Executive Council, held at theold Biltmore Hotel in New York Citywith Paul Kurtz, Ray Hyman, Phil Klass, and others including Martin Gardner himself, to my delight. The next day I was asked to join the organization as editor of its new magazine (then called The Zetetic, renamed the S KEPTICALINQUIRERthe next year). So Martin Gard ner was not only my introduction to any kind of sys- tematic skepticism and one of my early encouragers, but he was also there when I actually joined the effort. Over the ensuing three-plus decades, it was my\u2014and our readers'\u2014pleasure to have Martin Gardner write regularly forSI. At first he wrote only occasional short articles and reviews. When he retired his Scientific American column after thirty years, I wrote and asked if he'd like to con- sider writing a regular column for SI onpseudoscience and fringe science. I was delighted when he agreed. Let's give it a try, he answered, and see how it goes. That column (\"Notes of a Psi-Watcher,\"which he and I later renamed \"Notes of a Fringe Watcher\") ap peared in every issueof SI from Sum mer 1983 to January/Feb -ruary 2002. He recently resumed it on an irregular basis, and his last one, mailed tome May 12, ten days before his death, appears on page 10. Martin was an editor's delight. His columns always arrived early, usually weeks ahead of deadline. Sometimes he would check with me in advance about apossible subject; more typically he just mailed in a new column, surprising me with the topic. A new one's arrival was always the high point of my day. They were clear, concise, involving, revealing, knowledgeable, relevant, and usually witty\u2014the product of a lively, extraordi- narily well-informed, unique mind. His columns were substantive but at the same time eminently readable. He typed them double-spaced on an electric typewriter, and the newspaperman in him (which he had once been for awhile after studying philosophy at the Uni versity of Chicago) carefully corrected any typos or madeshort word changes with black ballpointpen. Also in the newspaper tradition, he revised sections by cutting and pasting, which was always done impeccably. I sel- dom had to do any real editing. Over the years his columns covered everyone from Russell Targ, MargaretMead, Shirley MacLaine, Arthur Koest ler,Rupert Sheldrake, Marianne William son,Jean Houston, Doug Henning, andPhillip Johnson to maverick Cornellastronomer Tommy Gold (twice); andeverything from James Randi's ProjectAlpha (his first SI topic) to weird water, fuzzy logic, reflexology, urine therapy, psychic astronomy, the Klingon language, and the humorous yet profound question of whether Adam and Eve had navels. Every few years he would collect the SIcol umns, together with a few reviews and essays published elsewhere, in a new book. The first were The New Age: Notes of a Fringe Watcher and On the Wild Side. The latest three are Are Universes Thicker Than Black berries? (2003), The Jinn from Hyperspace(2008), and When You Were a Tadpole and I Was a Fish (2009). On September 11, 2001 (yes, that same terrible day), I opened a letter from Martin that I had dreaded recieving. His beloved wife, Charlotte, had died earlier of a stroke, and he was getting twocolumns to me quickly because he knewhe would soon go into a depression over her loss and be unable to write any more. And, besides, he was eighty-seven. \"I've had a long run,\" he ended, \"and doing the column has been a great pleasure.\" It was a sad day for all of us. But in 2005 I saw a new book review he had published else- where, and I wrote and invited him to once again write for SI if he felt he could.His first was a two-article series on \"The Memory Wars.\" We published it in our SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October 2010 33A Tribute and Celebration Martin Gardner (with glasses) is at back left in this historic photo of the first CSICOP meeting, in August 1977 in New York City. From left are Lee Nisbet, Ray Hyman, James Randi, Gardner, and (at end of table) Paul Kurtz. (CSICOP archives)SI Sept/Oct gone? Skeptics, say it isn't so! From my earliest days as a magician, skeptic, and investigative writer, Martin was there\u2014a presence as reassuring as that of a beloved relative whom one could always count on when needed but who showed up in person only at the occa- sional family reunion. Extraordinarily shy,Martin avoided public appearances and didn't lecture, grant media interviews, or even accept awards when they were con-ditional on his appearing. Still, he was there. When I was trans- forming myself into \"Mendell the Men tal - ist\" as a young magician, Martin helpfully pecked out on his typewriter a suggestion: a mind-reading effect based on a principle usually embodied in a close-up trick thathe very cleverly adapted to the stage. Once, while I was working as a researcher on a certain project, Martin invited me to visit his home in Hen - dersonville, North Carolina, and use his extensive personal library. (This I de - clined, of course, for it would have been too great an imposition on too generous a friend.) When I reviewed an event held in honor of the shy genius (who had made an exceedingly rare appearance) for theS KEPTICALINQUIRER, Martin thought - fully wrote a personal note of apprecia-tion. And he thought of this same writer in 2002 when he ended his long-running column for SI (since 1983), \"Notes of a Fringe Watcher.\" Asked who he thought might succeed him as leading columnist for the magazine, he wrote, \"Joe Nickell?\" I did not meet Martin in person until 1989 when he uncharacteristically ap -peared at a CSICOP Executive Council meeting in Tampa, Florida. He did notusually wear ties, but someone got him one for a formal group photo, and I wasable to give it a straightening just in time. At the 1996 Gathering for Gardner inAtlanta, Georgia, I brought a tape re - corder on behalf of Prometheus Booksand recorded Martin in his hotel room reading the introduction to the audiotape version of Science: Good, Bad and Bogus. Time spent with him was precious. But it was as a writer that his presence was most clearly felt. Despite his personalshyness, his writings were those of a polar opposite: a bold, courageous critic, a pro- lific correspondent, and a towering think - er and polymath. (Never mind that he once said in an interview in these pages[March/April 1998], \"I just playall the time, and am fortunate enough to get paid for it.\") In 1952 he published the first edition of his seminal book, now known to skep- tics worldwide as Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. The book proved to be the seed that blossomed into the modern skeptical movement. Gardner mentored a small group of skeptical activists\u2014includ- ing magician James Randi, psychologist Ray Hyman, and several others\u2014a group that in 1976 philosopher Paul Kurtz expanded and turned into an interna-tional organization known as the Com - mittee for the Scientific Inves tigation of Claims of the Paranormal (presently theCommittee for Skeptical Inquiry). Now Martin Gardner belongs to his- tory, to the pantheon of great intellects of the twentieth century\u2014many of whom were his admirers. A one-man think tankand the father of modern skepticism, he was a presence indeed. But he remains a presence, still alive in our minds, often smiling amid the juggled words, still teaching us to think\u2014and to not forget to have fun. Joe Nickell is CSI's senior research fellow and SI's \"Investigative Files\" columnist. He is author of dozens of books about his skeptical investiga- tions, such as Real or Fake, Adven tures in Paranormal Investigation, Relics of the Christ, Real-Life X-Files, and Looking for a Miracle.January/February and March/April 2006 issues. The first part appears in our latest SI anthology, Science Under Siege (Pro - metheus, 2009). He was prolific to the end. We had two columns from him during the pro- duction of our March/April 2010 issue. So we published the shorter one (about fatal sweat lodge guru James Arthur Ray) as his regular column and the longer one (about Oprah Winfrey and her gullibilityon pseudo-medical matters) as an article. Perhaps surprising for such a towering intellect, Martin was a modest and unas- suming man. Kindly, I would say. Ob - viously highly intelligent and a supremelyclear thinker, he showed no sign of ego. Asomewhat shy person, he never attendedconferences or spoke at public gatherings. Although this was a disappointment to his myriad fans, I think he felt his time was better spent doing his own kind of research, reading up on the latest claims of nonsense and crackpottery and buffoon-ery, and giving his unique critical perspec- tive in clear, concise prose. But he was a wonderful correspondent. Any letter toMartin drew an almost immediate type- written response. That was true of my experience, and I have heard the same from others. His letters were always friendly, direct, relevant, useful, and con-cise. He never wasted words. I have quite a collection of such short letters from Martin and will always treasure them. Martin Gardner was\u2014among manyother things\u2014a brilliant and essentially self-taught intellectual who had the respect of the world's greatest scientists and academics. The grandfather of themodern skeptical movement, he was an extraordinarily knowledgeable skeptic with a uniquely whimsical and easily amused mind who never took himselfover-seriously, a great teacher through example of what skepticism and skeptical inquiry are all about, a clear writer and thinker, a peerless critic of nonsense, and a steadfast advocate of science and rea- son\u2014in short, a national treasure. No; make that a world treasure. Kendrick Frazier is editor of the S KEPTICALINQUIRER, a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and a longtime member of its executive council. Martin Gardner's Presence JOE NICKELLMARTIN GARDNER 34 Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:41 PM Page 34I was aware of Martin Gardner at least since I was in high school in Illinois dur- ing the 1960s. I hung around as much as I could with friends who were inter- ested in science and philosophy, and in such circles Gardner was already consid-ered a demigod, at the very least. I for-get exactly when I first read his Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, but Iwas enormously impressed by it. Hecovered so many subjects in such detail,using such impeccable logic. (From a current standpoint, what's sobering is how many of these fads and fallacies, thoroughly debunked almost sixty years ago, are still peddled, usually in nearly the same form!) I first met Gardner at one of the very early CSICOP functions in New York City in 1977 or '78. He was still living inNew York at the time (appropriately onEuclid Avenue in Hastings-on-Hudson).CSICOP held several press con ferences tooffer itself as a resource for responsible sci- ence journalism, as well as to de nouncethe often-uncritical coverage of \"paranor- mal\" subjects in the media. Thiswas longbefore CSICOP sponsored any publicevents. I had been working fairly closelywith the noted UFO skeptic, the latePhilip J. Klass, one of the founding fel-lows of CSICOP, who helped me get involved with the organization and its activities. Gardner attended all of the CSICOP events in New York City but never spoke to the public or to the press.I remember being awestruck to have the opportunity to meet, and get to know, this soft-spoken, extraordinary man. I was even more awestruck when he suggested we go down to the hotel restaurant to have lunch together. I real- ized even at that time that this was an extraordinary privilege. I asked him about his training in mathematics, expecting to hear him rattle off a list of studies and degrees. \"I didn't take much math,\" he re plied. \"I studied philoso-phy.\" I expected to hear that mathemat- ical puzzles flowed effortlessly out of his brain, but that was also not so. He ex -plained that he was not an expert in mathematical puzzles or even a big fan of them; he just kept writing them up because that was what the readers of Scientific Amer ican wanted, and typi- cally he was just one puzzle ahead of the magazine's deadline. We also discussed the famous Cottingley Fairy photos, which had fooled Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and how at that time UFOlogist Jerome Clark, then an editor at Fate magazine, was claiming the photos as proof of some sort of \"alternate reality.\" Gardner wrote about that in the notes and also in a postscript to his essay \"TheIrrelevance of Conan Doyle,\" published in Science: Good, Bad and Bogus. He also wrote there about my own hoax article suggesting that the Cottingley Fairies were Winged UFO Occupants: \"It was printed in Official UFO magazine, October 1977, by editors too stupid torealize that Sheaffer had his tongue in his cheek.\" Later Gardner asked me if I wanted him to mail me his UFO files, saying that I would make better use of them than he could. I gladly accepted his offer. The files were not extensive, con- sisting mostly of clippings from newspa-pers and magazines of the 1950s and'60s, but they contained a number of hard-to-find items. I gratefully merged them with my own files. After Gardner moved to North Caro - lina, I never saw him in person again. But we remained in touch on a number of subjects. I remember one time when I contacted him for information about a specific cult. He said that the most know - ledgeable critic of that group was a certain individual who I had never heard of. \"But be careful in your dealings with him,\" Gardner said. \"He is obsessed with this cult, and he has a history of unstable behavior.\" I cautiously followed up on his lead and discovered that, as usual, Martin had gotten it exactly right. Looking back on his career, perhaps the most surprising thing is not only the quantity and the quality of his output but the fact that all of it was written without benefit of a computer or word processor! I cannot write anything worth publishingunless I revise it three or four times. He had an amazingly clear writing style:everything Martin Gard ner wrote, no matter how technical, is explained so well that the average reader can under- stand it, and every conclusion he reaches follows directly from the information he just set forth. Some of the late founding fellows of CSICOP, whose names today are house-hold words, had egos the size of Texas, if not Alaska. This stands in enormouscontrast with Martin Gardner, a man for whom they all genuinely proclaimed their admiration yet was nonetheless one of the most sincere and likable human beings I have ever met. Robert Sheaffer is a fellow of CSI and has been SI's \"Psychic Vibra tions\" columnist for more than thirty years.The Humble Demigod ROBERT SHEAFFER SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October Charlatans ROBERT CARROLL Martin Gardner's writings on the paranor- mal and pseudoscience profoundly influ-enced a generation of writers, in cludingme, as can be seen by the many referencesto his works in The Skeptic's Dictionary . He introduced us to a bizarre world populated by the likes of L. Ron Hubbard, Rudolf Steiner, Edgar Cayce, Bridey Murphy, and a host of other characters on the fringe. He taught us that crackpots and charlatans aredangerous. They should not be ignoredbut instead thoroughly exposed for whatthey are by detailed critical analysis. My introduction to Gardner was through his Scientific American column on brain teasers and logic puzzles. Whenhe gave up writing that brilliant andmuch-missed column, Douglas Hofstad - ter picked up the mantle. My obsessionwith Gardner's writings on the paranormal and pseudoscience began after reading aHofstadter column titled \"World Views in Collision: The S KEPTICAL INQUIRER versus the National Inquirer. \" Hofstadter's pane- gyric to CSICOP and SI is one of the sem- inal essays in the history of scientific skep- ticism. Every skeptic should keep it at theready for inspiration and revitalization. (The essay, reprinted in Hof stadter's Meta - magical Themas: Quest ing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern , in cludes an account of Gardner's split with Marcello Truzzi overhow best to deal with Immanuel Veli -kovsky and other pseudoscientists.) Hofstadter's essay inspired many teach- ers to become followers of SI, whichinevitably led us to become followers of Martin Gardner's many inquiries. In fact, many of us became somewhat fanatical about our inquiries into what Gardner called \"wild beliefs.\" We can't stop investi- gating and writing about them. Thanks to Martin Gardner, James Randi, and others of like spirit, we won't be quiet until the last bit of bogus science is buried with thelast charlatan claiming paranormal or super natural powers.

He is a CSI fellow.A Martin Gardner Sampler It is not at all amusing when people are misled by scientific claptrap. Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science (Dover), p. 6 There is a type of self-styled scientist who can legitimately be called a crank. It is not the novelty of his views or the neurotic motivation behind his work that provide the grounds for calling him this. The grounds are the technical criteria by which theories are evaluated. If a man persists in advancing views that are contradicted by all available evidence, and which offer no reason- able grounds for serious consideration, he will rightfully be dubbed a crank by colleagues. Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science ,p. 8 The modern pseudoscientist . . . stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are closely integrated and evaluated. He works in isolation. Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science , p. 11 Even when a pseudoscientific theory is completely worthless there is a cer- tain educational value in refuting it. Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science , p. 321 I'm not sure why I enjoy debunking. Part of it surely is amusement over the fol- lies of true believers, and [it is] partly because attacking bogus science is a painless way to learn good science. You have to know something about relativ- ity theory, for example, to know where opponents of Einstein go wrong. ... Another reason for debunking is that bad science contributes to the steady dumbing down of our nation. Crude beliefs get transmitted to political leaders and the result is considerable damage to society. \"A Mind at Play,\" interview in the S KEPTICALINQUIRER,March/April 1998, p.36-37 Although \"debunker\" is often considered a pejorative term, I do not find it so. A major purpose of S KEPTICALINQUIRERhas always been to debunk the most out- rageous claims of bogus science. I make no apologies for being a debunker. I believe it is the duty of both scientists and science writers to keep exposing the errors of bad science. Did Adam and Eve Have Navels? (W.W. Norton), p. 2 For every example of a crank who later became a hero there were thousands of cranks who forever re mained cranks. Science: Good, Bad and Bogus (Prometheus) ,p. xiii Cranks by definition believe their theories and charlatans do not, but this does not prevent a person from being both a crank and a charlatan. Science: Good, Bad and Bogus , p. xiv In discussing extremes of unorthodoxy in science I consider it a waste of time to give rational arguments. Those who are in agreement do not need to be educated about such trivial matters, and trying to enlighten those who dis- agree is like trying to write on water. ... For these reasons, when writing about extreme eccentricities of science, I have adopted H.L. Mencken's sage advice: one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand syllogisms.

Martin hadbeen in an assisted living center there since 2002. Randi introduced us, and thisbegan my personal connection to Martin. Since that day, I periodically visited Martin in his room. Two visits stand out.On one occasion the visit was profession-ally motivated because an author askedme to interview Martin for his book.About midway through, Martin turnedthe tables and hebecame the interviewer. I was surprised at his sudden interest inme. What stood out most was his inquir- ing about my beliefs and view of reli-gion\u2014just before I was going to ask him similar questions on the same subject. He sensed my frustration in not knowingexactly how to \"label\" my beliefs. Aftergiving him a lengthy explanation, he said,\"I know how to label your beliefs.\" Hecontinued, \"You're a philosophical theist,like me.\" It was great to finally be able toconcretize my position. Until that time, Ireally didn't know what to call it. Whenmy interview of Martin concluded, I went home and immediately Googledthe term. The first thing I found was a Wikipedia definition. The end of theentry now states, \"Martin Gardner(1914-2010) was a contemporary def - ender of philosophical theism.\" It wasobvious Martin knew what he was talk-ing about. The other visit that stood out was per- sonally motivated; I took my nine-year- old nephew, Cole, to meet this extraordi- nary man. Martin amazed Cole with visual illusions, which were displayed throughout his room. Particularly eye- catching to Cole was the \"Paper Dragon\" illusion\u2014designed for a special gathering honoring Martin. He had a very effective way of using entertainment as an educa- tional tool. It certainly worked for Cole. Although Cole may not have had a full appreciation for the magnitude ofIcannot recall when or why I first became interested in pseudoscience. ... Not being a scientist, but only a science journalist, I have always been in trigued by fringe science, perhaps for the same reason that I enjoy freak shows at carni- vals and circuses. Pseudo scien tists, especially the extreme cranks, are fasci- nating creatures for psychological study. Moreover, I have found that one of the best ways to learn something about any branch of science is to find out where its crackpots go wrong. On the Wild Side (Prometheus), p. 7 As all magicians know, physicists are among the easiest people in the world to be fooled by magic tricks. They are so used to working with Mother Nature, who never cheats, that when confronted with the task of testing a psychic charlatan they have no comprehension of how to set up adequate controls. ... Am I saying that all psychic re searchers should be trained in magic, or seek the aid of magicians, before they test miracle workers? That is exactly what I am saying. The most eminent scientist, untrained in magic, is putty in the hands of a clever charlatan. \"Lessons of a Landmark PK Hoax,\" Gardner's first Summer 1983, p. 18; reprinted as \"Project Alpha\" in The New Age (Prometheus), 1991 paperback edition Ilike to think I am unduly harsh and dogmatic only when writing about a pseu- doscience that is far out on the continuum that runs from good science to bad, and when I am expressing the views of all the experts in the relevant field. Where there are areas on the fringes of orthodoxy, supported by respected scientists, I try to be more agnostic. \"A Mind at Play,\" interview in the S KEPTICALINQUIRER,March/April 1998, p. 37 Finding 666 in the names of famous people is a number-twiddling pastime that has obsessed numerologists ever since the Book of Revelation was written. With patience and ingenuity it is not difficult to extract 666 from almost any person's name. For example, using Blevins's Bible code, I discovered that sun, moon, and Pat J. Buchanan each adds to 666. The same code yields 666 if you apply it to Hal Lindsey B , the B standing, of course, for Beast. \"The Second Coming of Jesus,\" \"Notes of a Fringe Watcher\" column, S KEPTICALINQUIRER, January/February 2000, p. 11 The steady expansion of scientific knowledge is one of the few aspects of human history\u2014perhaps the only aspect\u2014about which we can say dogmatically that genuine progress takes place. Moreover, the progress itself progresses. The expansion occurs with steadily increasing rapidity. The Ambidextrous Universe (Scribner), preface to the Second Edition Icontinue to be amazed that any professional mathematician would suppose that mathematics has no reality apart from human cultures.

As close as my proximity to Martin was, I'm sorry I didn't visit him more often\u2014my loss. I've had many favorite issues of the S KEPTICALINQUIRERover the years. I suspect this issue will climb to the top of my list. Bryan Farha is a professor at Oklahoma City University, where he coordinates the graduate program in applied behavioral studies, and is edi- tor of Paranormal Claims: A Critical Analysis . The Connoisseur of Paradox JOHN ALLEN PAULOS A connoisseur of paradox, Martin Gard - ner had a fittingly paradoxical career. Although he majored in philosophy and took no mathematics courses after high school, he probably did more to stimulate an appreciation for, curiosity about, and discussion of mathematical ideas than scores of us mathematics professors. I remember reading his books on rec - reational math as an undergraduate and being eager to explain the puzzles in them to whoever would listen. In a couple ofcases I even used them to win small bets. Over the years we exchanged a couple ofbook blurbs, a benign log(arithm)-rollingthat was a signal honor for me, and we also corresponded a bit about his novelThe Art of Peter Fromm and other topics, jokes in particular. Once he sent me a let-ter with some quite funny, quite non-G-rated examples. Later, in the Scientific Amer ican, he published a very elegant illustration of a religious hoax I proposed based on Kruskal's theorem. His interests ranged from Lewis Car - roll and the philosophy of mathematics to scientific hoaxes and popular culture. Even in his last essay for the S KEPTICAL INQUIRER(March/April 2010) published in his lifetime, he took on Oprah Winfrey's pseudo-cures. A modest man, a clear-eyed skeptic, and an extra- ordinaire, he was a beacon of san- ity to the end.John Allen Paulos is professor of mathematics at Temple University and author of such books as Innumeracy, A Mathe matician Reads the Newspaper , and Once Upon a Number. He is a CSI fellow. Characterizing the Hermit Scientist SCOTT O. LILIENFELD I had been deeply interested in scientific skepticism for a solid fifteen years before I read Martin Gardner's classic book Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science , first published as In the Name of Science in 1952. In fact, for quite some time I had resisted reading it. No book that old, I assumed, could possibly offer much to us today. Moreover, I thought, Gardner's examples must surely be outdated. Nothing, I soon discovered, could be further from the truth. Indeed, on finally reading Fads and Fallacies , I was amazed by how fresh and relevant it is to modern skepticism\u2014and to the psychology of pseudoscience. As all dedicated skeptics know, in this book Gardner delineated the core characteristics of the \"hermit sci- entist,\" whom we might regard as the pro- totypical pseudoscientist. For Gardner, the hermit scientist (1) \"considers himself as a genius,\" (2) \"regards his colleagues, without ex ception, as heads,\" \"be secuted and discriminated against,\" (4) \"has strong compulsions to focus his attacks on the greatest scientists and the best established theories,\" and (5) \"has a tendency to write in complex jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined.\" These psychological attributes ring as true today as they did nearly sixty years ago. Although some of the lyrics of the song may have changed (Hollow Earth - ers, orgone theorists, and Lyksenkoists are no longer central foci of skeptical inquiry), the music hasn't. In contempo- rary psychological lingo, we might saythat Gard ner hit upon many of the fea- tures of pseudoscientists that predispose them to confirmation bias: the tendencyground, as Genesis has it, or evolved over billions of years from the dust of a primeval fireball? The fact that we are here proves that we derive, in some crazy sense, from the fireball, and I for one find this more miraculous than the Genesis story. A review of Steven Weinberg's book, The First Three Minutes , re printed in Order and Surprise (Prometheus), p. 319 For as long as I can remember I have been impressed, perhaps overwhelmed is more accurate, by the vastness of the universe and the even greater vast- ness of the darkness that extends beyond the farthest frontiers of scientific knowledge. The Night Is Large: Collected Essays 1938\u20141995 (St. Martin's Press), p. xvii We are all little children walking down a road of yellow brick in a crazy, out- landish, Ozzy sort of world.

Introduction to the 1960 Dover edition of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum Martin Gardner quotes compiled by Kendrick Frazier 38 Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER MARTIN GARDNERSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/29/10 10:16 AM Page 38to seek out evidence consistent with one's hypotheses and to deny, dismiss, or dis-tort evidence that isn't. When one reads Gardner's twenty-five remarkable case studies of thinking gone haywire, it is notdifficult to discern a common thread run- ning through their enormous surface diversity: the persistent refusal of propo- nents of pseudoscience to allow contraryevidence to penetrate their web of beliefs.More than anything else, Gardner's firstbook is a powerful cautionary tale of the perils of intellectual hubris. I regard Fads and Fallacies as the most significant work in the history of scientific skepticism, as its message remains everybit as pertinent to the vexing problem ofpseudoscience today as it was in the 1950s. Gardner's passing gives all of us an oppor- tunity not only to mourn the loss of one ofthe founders of the modern skepticalmovement but to revisit the wisdom andinsights he imparted so many years ago.

He is a CSI fellow and SI consult- ing editor. The Friend I Never Met CHRISTOPHER C. FRENCH I never had the pleasure of meeting Martin Gardner, but I feel as if I have known him as a friend for decades. Over a long and prolific career, he published over seventy books and countless newspa- per and magazine articles. These include his regular column for the S KEPTICAL IN - QUIRER, \"Notes of a Fringe Watcher,\" which ran for almost twenty years and his\"Mathematical Games\" column, which ran in Scientific Amer ican for some twenty- five years. I cannot claim to have read everything that this great man ever wrote, of course, but I may well have more books on my bookshelves written by him than by any other author. When I try to think back tothe first publication of his that I ever read, I simply cannot remember which one it was. Memory is a funny thing, as Martin Gardner well knew, and it feels to me as if his books have been in my life for as long as I can remember, like those really good friends that we all take for granted. By a process of deduction, I can work out that I must have read his collections ofrecreational mathematics columns from Scientific American , published under such titles as Mathematical Circus , many years before I read his skeptical classic Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. The for- mer books entertained and educated me. They made math fun\u2014at least for a self- professed nerd like me! But Fads and Fallacies had a much more profound impact on me than those stimulating collections of brainteasers. Itwas one of the first books on skepticism that I read, along with James Randi's Flim-Flam! and The Truth About Uri Geller and David Marks and Richard Kammann's The Psychology of the Psychic. The truth is, dear reader, that until well into early adulthood I was ... well, I guess I have to come clean ... a believer in the paranormal! The book that actually opened my eyes to the wonderful worldof skepticism was James Alcock's Para - psychology: Science or Magic? , but I quickly followed that excellent volume with the skeptical works of Gardner, Randi,Marks, and Kammann. One thing is notable about all five of these books: they have all withstood the test of time wonderfully. Indeed, all five are still on reading lists for the course on anomalistic psychology that I teach aspart of the BSc Psychology program at Goldsmiths College, University of London (along with lots of more recent texts, of course!). But it should be borne in mind that all of those classics but one were written in the early 1980s. Fads and Fallaciesis now well over half a century old and is still well worth reading. It is, of course, somewhat depressing that most of the fads so devastatingly cri- tiqued in this wonderful volume are stillgoing strong today. Through these works and others (notably, Science: Good, Bad and Bogusand the delightful Annotated Alice books), I felt that I did know Martin Gardner even though I never actually met him. I would like to have met him. I am sure I would have liked him. Like thousands of other fans around theglobe, I will miss him. Christopher C.

Last of the Polymaths NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON With a career spanning most of a century, Martin Gardner was the last of the poly- maths. Nearly everyone in the skepticcommunity, across multiple generations, was directly influenced by his writings. As a kid, reading his monthly columns for Scientific American , I naively believed that the simultaneous breadth and depth ofGardner's interests was common. Now I am certain it was unique. \"Martin Gardner is one of the great intellects produced in this country in this century.\" \u2014Douglas Hofstadter, author of G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach , on the cover of Gardner's The Night Is Large (1996) \"For more than half a century, Martin Gardner has been the single brightest beacon defending rationality and good science against the mysticism and anti-intellectualism that sur round us.\" \u2014The late Stephen Jay Gould, Harvard University, on the back cover of Gardner's The Night Is Large (1996) SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October 2010 39 A Tribute and CelebrationSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 an astrophysicist, is direc- tor of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History and a CSI fellow. His most recent book is The Pluto Files . The Roots of Skepticism JAY M. PASACHOFF I have often cited two books as formative of my career: Martin Gardner's Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science (I can pic- ture the cover of the Dover edition, whichcame out in 1957 while I was at the Bronx High School of Science) and C.P .Snow's T wo Cultures and the Scien tific Revolution (which I bought when it first came out in 1959, at a bookstore in San Francisco while attending a summer mathresearch program at Berkeley\u2014just priorto my starting Har vard as a freshman). In the fifty-plus years since, I have tried to conduct my science, my life, and mycareer with the ideals of both of thoseauthors in mind: eschewing fads, fallacies, and pseudoscience of all kinds and trying to be educated in both science and thehumanities. A few years ago, I started teaching a seminar at Williams College on \"Scienceand Pseudoscience\" to about a dozenjuniors and seniors. I started out with C.P . Snow's book and ideas as a frame to the seminar and then had one of the twelveweekly sessions devoted to Martin Gard -ner's work, with a reading list (and library reserve) that included all of his relevant books. The course has been quite popular, straining the limit of twenty that I subse- quently adopted, with students begging to be admitted. The discussions have been lively and interesting. I look forward to next spring's version. So I am back to my roots in Martin Gardner's important plea for rationality, and I am very grateful to him for his ideas. Jay M. Pasachoff is the Field Memorial Pro - fessor of Astronomy at Williams Col lege, Wil - liamstown, Massachusetts, and a CSI fellow.A Blowtorch Turned on Jell-O MARTIN BRIDGSTOCK Martin Gardner burst into my awareness in the 1960s. I remember myself as a trou- bled boy in my early teens, mooching through the weekly market in Grimsby, a U.K. fishing port. I picked up a copy of Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science for five British shillings\u2014about 40 U.S. cents in today's money\u2014and read it. Then I read it again, and again. Here wasa grown-up with massive intellectual powers focusing critically upon paranor- mal claims. It was a bit like watching a blowtorch being turned on Jell-O. I was shocked, amused, and delighted. Why wasn't anyone else doing this? Gardner taught me a lot. First, that all humans, without exception, can be wrong. And since all books, papers, and paranormal theories are produced by humans, they can be wrong too. There isno way out, except to check the evidenceand think for yourself. Second, he taught me the importance of clarity in writing through his ability to skewer pseudoscien- tists with a few words of description or criticism. I am no Gardner, but these messages sank into my bones. Years later, I discovered Gardner's mathematical column in Scientific Amer - ican. My math was barely good enough to follow the arguments, but Gardner'sdelight in human inventiveness shone clearly through every paragraph. He lovedproducing dizzying paradoxes from sim- ple assumptions and throwing light on whole new fields of mathematical thought. It was the other side of his criti-cisms of pseudoscience: use your mind, and wonders will follow. Obfuscate, and there is disaster ahead. In a very real sense, Martin Gardner cannot die. Like David Hume, he is a liv- ing thinker whose ideas will remain rele- vant as long as human foolishness persists. Among much else, he was one of the founders of the modern skeptical move- ment, and his truth really will go march- ing on!

Goodbye, Master of Journalists LUIS ALFONSO G\u00c1MEZ Martin Gardner was the master for those of us who believe that teaching science should include denouncing bunk. \"I have found that one of the best ways to learn something about any branch of science isto find out where its crackpots go wrong,\" he wrote in On the Wild Side (1992). Exactly so. In a world in which so many feel attracted to the paranormal, this maxim should guide the work of journal- ists who inform the public about science. T oo often we have irresponsibly avoided criticizing pseudoscience, considering it undignified. We should take advantage of flying saucers, Atlantis, extrasensory perception, and creationism to hook the public andteach them to appreciate biology, psychol- ogy, geology, history\u2014science and knowl- edge in general. We should use pseudo- science as the hook to teach science andcritical thought. Martin Gard ner did it for decades with the clarity of someone who considered himself \"basically a jour-nalist.\" His books are always at hand to consult to remember what he saidabout so many of the absurdities that sur- round us. T oday the world is a little darker; rea- son's flame dims in the darkness becausewe are without Martin Gardner. We will miss him. I will continue to have himwith me daily, as I have since I read him for the first time, as an example of what a scientific journalist must be. Luckily, we have his books to guide us.

When I first started with the magazine, I knew who he was byreputation, but I don't think it was until later, as I was reintroduced to his columnsand earlier work, that I really gained a trueappreciation for his genius. I remember getting a column from Martin for the first time. To be honest, Idon't remember what the topic was, but Ido remember being slightly annoyed. You see, it was typewritten and photocopied (with a few handwritten editorial correc-tions). I was used to e-mailed attachmentsand columns submitted on CDs and floppy discs\u2014what was this typewritten stuff? As the years went on I came to trea- sure and look forward to seeing his three- page, double-spaced columns in the dark black, old-school typewriter font. It re -minded me of good, old-fashioned skep- ticism. It reminded me my grandfather\u2014a veteran journalistand skeptic himself\u2014would write to me when I was a teenager. One thing I learned from Martin, albeit indirectly, was how skeptical research and investigation can make a real difference in people's lives. It's all well and good to write skeptically about UFOs orghosts in the abstract, but it's a different matter when you're dealing with real peo-ple and real problems. One day in 2000 I got a call at the office from a man at a payphone some- where in Arizona. The man had a soft voice\u2014he sounded like he was in his early fifties\u2014and wanted some information on an article he had read a long time ago in the S KEPTICALINQUIRERbut didn't have an issue date or year. \"It's an article by Martin Gardner,\" he said. \"It's on a cult.\" I told him that I'd try to locate the article and issue and forward his call to the front desk where he could purchase the issue, if he wished. \"No, no,\" he said. \"I need it now. Canyou fax it to me?\" While I was willing and able to help, it seemed like a bit of a steep request to stop what I was doing, look through two dozen back issues, find the article, and fax it to the man, long distance, at our ex - pense! Besides, I was skeptical that the payphone would be able to receive thefax. And what was the urgency anyway? The man put another quarter in the phone and explained that he feared that his younger brother was becoming in - volved in a cult. He was driving out to see his brother and was desperately trying tothink of ways to reason with him. Heremembered that Martin had written acolumn on the cult years before andhoped the information would provide skeptical facts and criticisms. He was call- ing from outside a copy shop with the shop's fax number handy so he couldreceive the fax there and go see his brother armed with more than just concerns. Ihung up the phone, sifted through the back issues on my shelf, copied the rele- vant pages, and faxed them off. I never heard back from the man; I hope he was able to reason with his brother using Martin's work, and I liked the idea that Martin's keen mind and research might help save a man's life.

My Reminiscence of Martin Gardner: A Lesson TIMOTHY BINGA Back in 2002, I was asked by Barry Karr, the executive director of CSICOP, if Iwould be able to leave right away on a tripto acquire some materials for the Centerfor Inquiry Libraries. It was during ourannual Summer Institute, and I was sup-posed to be teaching our students how libraries organize materials that are associ- ated with our various organizations. I did- n't think I should go; couldn't we just havethe items shipped? Barry told me I wouldneed to go in order to help select the materials and then help box them up, something not uncommon for some of our acquisitions. I again tried to defer; I had things that needed to get done, and couldn't this wait until the fall? Barry told me that Martin Gardner had decided to give us some of his papers and a collection of books, all related to our mission at the Center. I asked him when I could hit the road. Martin Gardner, \"father of the mod- ern skeptical movement,\" had asked us to select materials from his collection, box them up, bring them back to our Amherst offices, and maintain his collection on all matters of the paranormal, fringe claims, pseudoscience, etc. His book Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science kicked off this movement. He was a founding fellow of CSICOP, a writer for Prometheus Books, and a fellow Titanicaficionado (Wreck of the Titanic Foretold? , edited and with an introduction by Gardner, and several short stories and other hard-to- find Titanic- and ESP-related materials were included in the collection). I was ready to go right there and then. We made plans, and I picked up boxes and headed out to Hender son ville, North Carolina, in my wife's van the next morn- ing. I drove all day, staying in a hotel closeto his home. I called him early the next day and headed over to his house. He greeted me at the door, took me into his library, and pointed out what items he wanted me to take. We then began to select the various items from his collection. I was a little put off at first; I had met him once before in Amherst, but he seemed distracted to me, distant, not wholly there while we went through the books. We continued going through the shelves, placing the materials to one sideso I could box them up later. He pointedto a couple of filing cabinets, telling me I should take those too. I finally got up the courage to ask him about the Titanic, letting him know I also had an interest. He told me the same things I had gleaned from his book: the coincidences were not evidence of ESP orprecognition but a product of the times.Statistically, he stated, the fact that this was all coincidental fell within the realm of possibility. He went on to tell me that there is \"something\" that makes us allwant to believe in something greater than ourselves and that those who believe in ESP and related phenomena use Futility and the other works mentioned in his book as examples of these phenomena. He then pointed out the idea of selective memory, where one remembers only the hits, not the thousands of misses, which is why some people believe in psychics; they forget all the misses and remember only the things guessed correctly. In the case of the Titanic, there were thousands of sto- ries at the time about ships traveling the Atlantic that did not hit an iceberg (but might have had a Captain Smith). I asked him why the Titanicwas so popular for those trying to prove the exis- tence of psychic phenomena. He coun- tered by asking me why I thought the Titanicstruck such a chord with our cul- ture. Because I had studied this myself, Itold him that it was because it marked the end of an age: the disaster hit all the vari-ous levels of society at one time (the microcosm of society on the boat), and so many half-truths and myths surroundedthe Titanic. Everyone could find some- thing they could relate to and would find of interest. He looked at me and said that I had answered my own question. When I finished packing up the books and loading the van with the cabinets and boxes, I went back in to say goodbye. It was with more than a hint of sadness that he thanked me for taking his materials. Itwas then that I realized that this was a small part of himself being packed up; he was \"downsizing\" in preparation for amove (to be near his son in Okla homa, I found out later). I then thanked him forhis donation, telling him that I wouldtake very good care of his books and files.He said, \"I know you will.\" I headed back to Buffalo feeling very fortunate to be able to have shared a little time with him.

The prevalence of chronic heart dis- ease, stroke, and other related conditions in the U.S. adult pop- ulation in 2006 are shown in table 1 (American Heart Association 2010). Prevalence indicates the number of people living with the disease. For comparison purposes, cancer killed 560,000 Americans (23 percent of all deaths) in 2006. It is worth noting that 50 percent of the American population over age forty will develop cardiovascular or cerebrovasculardisease \u2014A Skeptic's View of Prevention and T reatment of Heart Disease and Stroke Notwithstanding the great progress made against heart disease and stroke, there is substantial underuse of effective medical therapy and tremendous overuse of coronary angiography, stenting, and coronary artery bypass 43diseases in whichblood flow through essential arteries is blocked (American Heart Association 2010). Since 1950, three general approaches to the prevention and treat ment of cardiovascular disease ( coronary artery disease [CAD]) and cerebrovascular disease have evolved: 1. Medical therapy with drugs, weight loss, diet, exercise, and smoking cessation 2.Interventional cardiology or neurology with angiography (insertion of catheters into the coronary or carotid arteries andinjection of radio-opaque dye to see postulated narrowings[lesions] with X-rays); (opening narrowed or plaque-filled with intravascular balloons); and stenting (placing a small mesh-work tube to keep the artery open)\u2014often termed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to treat CAD or percutaneous carotid intervention to treat cerebrovascular disease 3.Surgery with either coronary artery bypass grafting obstructing athero- sclerotic plaque inside the carotid artery However, in recent years, critics of interventional cardiology and neurology, and coronary and carotid surgery\u2014especially PCI and CABG\u2014have emerged (Diamond and Kaul 2008). (In this article I will lump together the various types of PCI withstenting. I will do the same with CABG, which is now some- times performed without opening the chest.) The critics claimthat underuse of effective medical therapy and overuse of these invasive procedures cost tens of billions of dollars in the U.S. per year. In fact, many patients are harmed by unnecessary use of these procedures, as discussed below. It is worth noting that thereare approximately 3, 2, and 1 percent procedure-related mortal-ity rates associated with CEA, CABG, and PCI, respectively(American Heart Association 2010). In this article I will review the current approach to\u2014and the results of the prevention and treatment of\u2014CAD and vascularstroke. Before beginning, however, I must define terms, brieflydescribe the anatomy and physiology of the heart and brain cir-culations, and then summarize what goes wrong in the coronaryand cerebrovascular circulations in disease (pathophysiology).From these considerations, I will explain the scientific hypothe- ses about what is wrong and why, and the implications for ther- apy. Finally, I will describe how the clinically operationalhypotheses differ from the scientific hypotheses and the real world consequences of these differences. To make these analyses valid, I will use only the highest quality evidence from \"gold stan- dard\" clinical science (e.g., controlled randomized trials). Moreover, I will judge results on the basis of the effects on patients in terms of heart attacks, strokes, and death\u2014the so- called \"hard endpoints.\" 1 Heart Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathophysiology The heart and brain require constant blood flow to survive. Theleft ventricle of the heart pumps blood into the major systemic artery, the aorta, to nourish the body. At the base of the aorta, right and left coronary arteries supply the right and left halves ofthe heart. These coronary arteries then branch into smaller con-duits to supply the entire heart. The blood is driven through thecoronary arteries' lumen by higher pressure in the aorta down apressure gradient. In a normal individual, if these arteries are acutely blocked (e.g., by a clot), the heart tissue downstream (dis- tal) will die due to lack of oxygen and nutrients (i.e., a heart attack occurs). However, in patients with chronic CAD and patchy atherosclerotic narrowing of the artery, a process knownas collateralization often occurs (see figure 1). Basically, small arteries (branches off the main coronary artery) before a narrow- ing ( stenosis ) join up with small arteries after the stenosis and carry blood into the post-stenotic artery. (Alternatively, branches from other coronary arteries may also supply the distal region.) This amazing phenomenon explains why some patients mayhave a totally closed-off (occluded) artery and yet suffer no ill effects\u2014because the collateral vessels supply the distal heart mus- cle. In one sense, such a \"patient\" is functionally normal\u2014his heart is perfectly well supplied with blood.

In coronary artery and cerebral artery disease, four atheroscle- rotic processes can occur (see figure 1): diffuse narrowing of the lumen due to disease-induced thickening of the artery wall (B), focal narrowing (stenosis) (C), rough plaques (E) on which clotscan occur (with sudden interruption of blood flow and a heartattack or stroke), and collateralization (D) if the atheroscleroticprocess is slow. The collateral shown in figure 1 is larger thanmost collaterals in living patients. I will now focus on the consequences of obstructive lesions due to atherosclerosis in the heart: In some cases there may be noor minimal clinical symptoms if there is adequate collateraliza- tion; angina pectoris(cardiac pain in the chest) if there is a severe stenotic lesion that manifests its presence during exercise when the heart muscle requires more blood (the attendant process is called myocardial ischemia [lack of blood]); or a heart attack when a clot suddenly forms on a plaque and the distal heart muscle tis- sue dies. Most heart attacks occur due to plaques that rupture or are very rough, forming a sticky nidus for clot formation and a subsequent cardiac catastrophe (see figure 1). Heart attacks occur less often due to tight stenotic lesions. (Similar processes occur in the cerebral circulation; however, only 20 percent of strokes are due to disease in the carotid arteries and are therefore accessible to surgical or percutaneous interventions.) In the heart, ineffec- tive cardiac pacing or heart stoppage and sudden cardiac death is associated with these atherosclerotic processes, especially if there is an acute closure of a coronary artery. The heart's electrical sys-tem (which causes the orderly beating of the heart) and the heart muscle are sensitive to interrupted blood flow. Pathologically, atherosclerosis is an often patchy thickening and hardening of the arterial wall, as depicted in figure 1. Under the microscope, atheroscerosis is the unnatural buildup of fats,fibrous tissue, and inflammatory cells in the vessel wall. Gradually the tissue \"hardens\" due to calcium inflow. Thereappear to be many causes of atherosclerosis (see table 2). How - ever, this is just a hypothesis at present, and the details of the causal mechanisms in an individual patient remain controversial. Three Surprising Clinical Facts Approximately twenty-five years ago, an Iowa cardiology group showed that the degree of stenosis as measured by angiography (injecting a radio-opaque dye into a diseased coronary artery and watching the dye traverse the arterial lumen in real time with anX-ray machine) did not correlate with maximal blood flow to the heart distal to (downstream from) the stenosis (White et al. 1984). In other words, some severely stenotic lesions had normal bloodflow on the distal side of the stenotic lesion under conditions requiring high flow, a surprising result. The authors said, \"Theresults of these studies should be profoundly disturbing to all physicians who have relied on the coronary angiogram to provide accurate information regarding the consequences of individualcoronary stenoses.\" Which is to say, these data should have under - cutthe reliance on the coronary angiogram and degree of steno- sis as bases for PCI or surgery, but they did not until very recently(see below). Second, in past studies of the natural history of angina pec- toris, before current medical, PCI, and CABG therapy, severalinvestigators found that the angina spontaneously resolved in 20 to 30 percent of angina patients, presumably due (in many cases) to collateralization (see figure 1) (Fry 1976). This fact must bekept in mind when evaluating clinical studies using angina as anendpoint. Third, surgery and invasive procedures have a large placebo effect on subjective endpoints like angina pectoris (Preston 1977; Beecher 1961). This result was shown in studies in which \"sham\" procedures were performed on coronary patients\u2014now consid-ered unethical experiments. But the results were clear\u2014thesesham procedures eliminated 40 to 70 percent of anginal episodes. Thus, angina is not a \"hard endpoint\" for clinical trials of invasive cardiac procedures because the perception of angina is subject to psychological and other subjective factors (Preston1977). One needs to look at death, heart attacks, strokes, and other hard endpoints (as discussed below) to be certain of clini- cal benefit.

Aging pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/23/10 12:39 PM Page 45Approach to the Problem In thinking about prevention and treatment of heart disease and stroke, we conventionally divide prevention into two categories: primary(treatment in high-risk patients to prevent disease) and secondary(treatment to prevent further disease, such as the use of drugs, procedures, or surgery to ameliorate the disease). Primary Prevention In the prevention of heart disease and stroke, primary prevention generally refers to modifying risk factors. Primary prevention evolved when the Framingham investigators and others followedup with large numbers of healthy people. The investigators mea-sured hypothesized risk factors like blood pressure and serum cholesterol and observed what happened over time (Dawber 1980). They found that people who had, for example, high blood pressure and/or high cholesterol had more angina pectoris,heart attacks, and strokes. They called these variables (e.g., high blood pressure and high cholesterol) risk factors. Subsequently, other investigators showed that lowering blood pressure and cho- lesterol led to less angina pectoris and fewer heart attacks and strokes, thus proving that risk-factor modification was helpful (see table 3). These measures are not controversial and are widely acknowl- edged to be based on sound clinical science. For example, blood pressure control alone has had an enormous impact on stroke and death from stroke. From these data came the Framingham clinical risk score , which summarizes risk factors (age, sex, bloodpressure, smoking, and cholesterol) (Dawber 1980). Others have added body weight, renal function, and the resting electrocar- diogram (EKG). These simple measurements (the Framingham risk score) predict subsequent cardiovascular events and stroke. Other more aggressive methods to assess risk in patients with- out symptoms (like screening with exercise testing using EKGchanges, cardiac isotope heart distribution studies after exercise or taking drugs, cardiac calcification and/or coronary angiogra- phy) add relatively little to the simple and easily obtained Framingham risk score (Scott 2009). Moreover, because of the many false positives and false negatives, these types of tests may do as much harm as good. For example, cardiac angiography has a 0.1 percent in-hospital death rate, 1.3 percent major complica- tion rate, and mean hospital charges of $31,000 (American Heart Association 2010). In other words, no one has ever shownthat if you do these tests in asymptomatic patients, the patients are better off in terms of hard endpoints than if you just treat theFramingham risk factors vigorously. Moreover, a recent review ofcoronary angiography showed just how tremendously overused coronary angiography is in the U.S.\u2014at enormous cost (Patel et al. 2010). The authors concluded that because PCI and CABG do not save lives or prevent heart attacks and strokes in asymp-tomatic patients more than appropriate medical therapy (but may relieve angina somewhat more in symptomatic patients, as discussed below), it makes little sense to angiogram an asympto- matic patient; by definition that person does not have angina (Patel et al. 2010). In summary, Framingham-type risk-factormodification slows or stops the atherosclerotic process and saves lives; there is no evidence that further testing is useful in the vastmajority of patients (Scott 2009). Primary prevention of severe carotid stenosis with CEA is controversial (see below). Secondary Prevention Secondary prevention in the approximately twenty-five million surviving Americans with chronic coronary heart disease and stroke is effective (see table 4). There is little argument about the utility of risk-factor modification (table 3) and drug use (table 4) because these practices are based on a large number of conclusive controlled clinical trials (Wijeysundera et al. 2010). (The drugs in table 4 are typically useful, but the exact drug program must be tailored to each individual patient.) When used in secondaryprevention, statins alone cause a 30 percent decrease in cardiac mortality over five years and about a 20 percent decrease in stroke (Scandinavian Simvistatin Survival Study Group 1994). Statins work by stabilizing unstable plaques and preventing clots, thus preventing some heart attacks and strokes; aspirin in sec- ondary prevention decreases intravascular platelet clumping (clotting) on rough plaques and subsequent heart attacks and strokes (Antithrombotic Trialist' Collaboration 2009); and blood pressure-lowering drugs work, in part, by lowering pressure andthus preventing arterial wall damage by excessive pressure. It is worth noting that statins have little effect on the atherosclerotic process per se (Blankenhorn et al. 1993). What is controversial, however, is the appropriate role of PCI and CABG in secondary prevention. But before discussing this 46 Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERTable 4 Secondary Prevention in Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Patients 1.

In diabetic patients, reasonable blood sugar controlSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:42 PM Page 46point, we need to return to the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease. As noted in figure 1, there are four main issues: dif- fuse atherosclerotic narrowing, rough plaques, focal stenoses, andcollaterals. At present, little can be done medically or interven- tionally about diffuse atherosclerotic coronary narrowing. Second, to prevent heart attacks, one must stabilize rough plaques so clots will not form and suddenly stop blood flow to the distal heart muscle and cause a heart attack. This can be done to a certain extent with statins and aspirin. However, PCI does nothing to stabilize rough plaques. Third, focal stenoses in prin- ciple can be dilated and stents put in to hold open narrowed arteries, or \"jump\" bypass grafts (CABG) can be placed surgi- cally\u2014similar to natural collaterals (see figure 1). In principle, this approach to focal stenoses should be helpful. In other words,to control angina and myocardial ischemia, the cause of angina,one should focus on focal stenoses that significantly impair bloodflow (see below). Finally, it is not currently possible to increase the size and number of collaterals. Notwithstanding these considerations, at present the overrid- ing hypothesis for many interventional cardiologists and surgeonswho employ, respectively, PCI or CABG surgery, is that the focus should be on dilating all significant stenoses with stents (PCI) or \"jumping\" lesions with arterial or venous bypass grafts (CABG) irrespective of the functional consequences of thestenosis (Diamond and Kaul 2008). (The work of the Iowa group [White et al. 1984] is ignored.) This philosophy is espoused in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines (Smith et al. 2005). Some criticspejoratively call this luminology\u2014excess focus on the anatomical stenosis and not enough focus on functional stenosis; other crit- ics call this approach the oculostenotic reflex : if you see a signifi- cant coronary or carotid stenosis on angiography, dilate and stent it (PCI) or, in other cases, \"jump\" it or remove it surgically(CABG or CEA, respectively) (Diamond and Kaul 2008; Pfisterer et al. 2010). (I should note, however, that in the recently updated guidelines, there is somewhat more emphasis on med- ical therapy [Patel et al. 2009].) But what are the clinical facts supporting the standard inter- ventional (PCI) or surgical (CABG and CEA) approaches, basedon luminology and the oculostenotic reflex? The results are sur- prising and, on first blush, may seem counterintuitive to some.First, when occluded coronary arteries were opened with balloon angioplasty (i.e., opening severe stenoses or completely closed arteries by blowing up micro-balloons in the stenotic area), col- lateral vessels substantially regressed during the five months of follow-up (Werner et al. 2003). This shows the dynamic nature of collaterals and the danger that if by ill luck an opened stenotic lesion clotted, there would be insufficient collateral blood flow to protect the distal myocardium, and a heart attack would occur. It is worth noting that many arterial collateral vessels are too small to be seen on routine angiography. Second, as I have already noted, the presence of even a severe angiographic stenosis does not establish the clinical importance of the stenosis, in part because in many cases collaterals can maintain blood flow to the heart distal to the stenosis (see figure 1). Third, a large randomized trial in 2,287 patients with wide-spread heart disease and at least one severely stenotic lesion seen on angiography was performed. This trial compared optimal medical therapy (OMT) (see table 4) with OMT plus PCI (the Courage trial) (Boden et al. 2007). After 4.6 years, there was no significant difference in deaths, heart attacks, or strokes (primary events) between the OMT group and the OMT plus PCI group. In fact, there were more primary events (211) in the OMT plusPCI group than the OMT group (202). The PCI added nothing but cost and tribulation. However, 33 percent of the OMT group and 22 percent of the OMT plus PCI group did not do well and required a PCI or CABG later. At one year, 66 percent of the patients in the PCI group were angina free, versus 57 per-cent in the OMT group (p<.05), but this advantage disappearedby three years. Whether this early advantage of PCI on angina is real, or a placebo effect due to the invasive procedure (as I dis- cussed earlier), is unknown. The authors concluded that inex-pensive OMT (see table 4) should be at tempted in all compara-ble patients because approximately 70 percent of such patientswill do well on just OMT. Thus, the standard interventional approach is not initially justified for such patients with CAD, including those with significant stenosis, in terms of hard end-points. This is an important discovery because each PCI costs about $51,000 (total hospital costs) (American Heart Association 2010) compared with approximately $500 per year for treatment with generic drugs (at low-cost pharmacies) (see table 4). Two very recent analyses of all the trials comparing stenting versus medical therapy in CAD also concluded that OMT should be attempted first, before consideration of angiography, PCI, or CABG (Trikalinos et al. 2009; Wijeysundera et al. 2010). Fourth, recently, the FAME (FFR vs. Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) investigators carried out a critical study attempting to improve on the philosophy of just treating stenotic lesions seen on angiography with PCI and stents (Tonino et al. 2009). Like the Iowa group twenty-five years ago, the FAME investigators hypothesized that you should stent only lesions thatare functionally important\u2014not those that are just anatomically present. They used a technique called fractional flow reserve (FFR) at the time of angiography to select functionally important lesions, and then randomized 1,005 patients to either standard PCI or PCI guided by FFR. The results were surprising to the cardiology community, which has practiced standard PCI for over twenty years. First, the average number of stents placed inthe standard PCI group was 2.7, versus 1.9 in the FFR-guided group (p<.001). More over, the primary endpoint of death, heart attack, or repeat revascularization was 18 percent in the standard group and 13 percent in the FFR group (p<.05). There were fifty-five deaths or heart attacks (11 percent) in the standard SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October 2010 47What is really missing for progress in coronary artery disease and stroke prevention are better drugs and lifestyle changes to slow or stop the atherosclerotic process.SI Sept/Oct thirty-seven (7 percent) in the FFR group (p<.05). Thus, with fewer stents, clinically there was a much better result.The authors conclude that stenting stenotic lesions that do not have adverse functional consequences is actually harmful, proba- bly because the stenting breaks off small clots and may clog use- ful collaterals. A skeptic might reasonably ask: why did it take twenty-five years for someone to conduct a trial like the FAMEtrial after the Iowa group reported that the degree of stenosis did not correlate with its functional consequences? (Please see dis- cussion about table 5 below.) Fifth, another controlled trial (Inspire) approached the prob- lem from a different viewpoint (Mahmarian et al. 2006). Theytook post-heart attack patients who showed ischemia and ran- domized the patients to either OMT or angiography/PCI. (Thepost-PCI drug regimen was not quite as intense as with theOMT patients). After two months, there was a comparabledecrease in myocardial ischemia in both groups. These resultshelp to explain the Courage study described above\u2014OMT aloneis as good as angiography/PCI plus medications in patients with myocardial ischemia. Finally, the recent Syntax trial compared PCI and CABG surgery in 1,800 patients with major CAD (Serruys et al. 2009). This trial was randomized and the results conclusive. At one year, death from any cause, heart attack, or stroke occurred in 7.7 per- cent (PCI) and 7.6 percent (CABG) of patients. There were, however, more strokes in the CABG group (2.2 vs. 0.6 percent; p<.001). On the other hand, 13 percent (PCI) versus 6 percent (CABG) of patients required repeat intervention, generally PCI (p<.001). In summary, on hard endpoints, these Syntax results show that there is no overall advantage of CABG over PCI in severe coronary disease; CABG patients suffer more strokes, but PCI patients require more revascularizations. In the case of symptomatic patients with severe carotid steno- sis, there is clear evidence that CEA is useful in carefully selected patients, as I discuss below. Interpretation In clinical medicine, there is general agreement that therapy (ei - ther preventive or treatment, as I defined above) must be proven effective and be in the patient's best interest. In other words, the risk-benefit ratio must favor the patient. This is the standard thatthe FDA and regulatory agencies throughout the world follow for approval of the sale of drugs. What is absolutely clear is that in both primary and secondary prevention, medical therapy works (see tables 3 and 4) and lessens heart attacks, strokes, and death substantially. Medical therapy is inexpensive (if generic drugs are used), and the risk-benefit ratio for either primary or secondary prevention is strongly in patients' favor. Moreover, the results of medical therapy for CAD are con- sistent with the hypothesis that heart attacks are generally due to acute clotting on rough plaques, andangina is usually due to impaired blood flow through stenotic lesions. Do PCI and CABG surgery as now practiced\u2014based on opening or bypassing stenoses\u2014appear rational? And do they work? As noted above, just bypassing or opening all stenotic lesions is not helpful (FAME trial). In fact, at least one-third of such lesions should not be stented. Second, at present there is evi- dence that these procedures are not needed in approximately 70 percent of patients currently undergoing these procedures (Courage trial). Moreover, 21 percent of patients who initially had PCI required a repeat PCI (Courage trial). PCI and CABG, unlike medical therapy, do nothing for rough plaque\u2014the initi- ating cause for most heart attacks. Thus, the luminology theory (i.e., heart disease and stroke occur due to high-grade stenosis, and all you need to do is fix the stenosis) is extremely incomplete and borders on pseudoscience. Whether CABG or PCI truly improve angina much more than modern optimal medical ther- apy is open to question because these interventions have a large placebo effect, as I have noted earlier. It is worth noting the economic consequences of this tremen- dous overuse of PCI and CABG. In 2006, 1.3 million PCIs were performed in the U.S. at a mean hospital cost of $51,000 each (American Heart Association 2010). Assuming one-quarter are done justifiably for acute indications and three-quarters for chronic heart disease (a conservative estimate), and 70 percent of the latter are not initially necessary (Courage trial), approxi- mately $35 billion per year is spent with no tangible benefit. Similarly, if 70 percent of the 250,000 yearly CABG operations are unnecessary at $112,000 hospital cost per operation, approx- imately $20 billion is spent on unnecessary CABG surgery. (This assumes that PCI and CABG are equivalent as per the Syntaxtrial referred to earlier). If this quantity of procedures were not performed, we would also need many fewer surgeons, interven- tional cardiologists, operating suites, etc. than are currently used. If the evidence is clear, why is there a disconnect between good clinical science and actual practice? Why is OMT under-used in cardiac patients (secondary prevention) and PCI and CABG overused? Diamond and Kaul (2008) offer five reasons, and I would add a sixth and seventh (see table 5). Diamond and Kaul (2008) suggest that if properly designed economic incen- tives were established, there would be much less PCI and CABG. The situation with secondary prevention of stroke is some- what different. In symptomatic patients with severe stenotic carotid lesions, there is clear evidence that CEA is useful (Meier 2010). Moreover, recent evidence reveals that, in appropriate symptomatic patients, carotid stenting after three years yields comparable results to CEA if done by experienced operators, but the long-term utility of stenting remains to be determined (Meier 48 Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERTable 5 Explanation for Overuse of Stents (PCI) and Jump Bypass Grafts (CABG) 1.

Patient pressure secondary to medical hype.SI Sept/Oct pgs_SI 2010 7/22/10 4:42 PM Page 482010). Notably, fewer cranial nerve injuries and heart attacks occurred in the stented group. In asymptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis, controlled trial evidence indicates that CEA is slightly better than medical therapy, with 1 percent fewer strokes per year (Chambers and Donnan 2008). Where Should We Go From Here? First, we need to employ optimal medical therapy (OMT) more frequently and more intensively (Diamond and Karl 2008) in CAD and cerebrovascular patients. The tremendous decline incardiovascular and stroke deaths is due, in large part, to primary and secondary prevention (see tables 3 and 4). We need to do everything possible to make sure patients are compliant with these programs. Second, we need to better understand which patients will benefit from PCI or, if necessary, CABG. There is some evidence that cardiac patients with a major functionally important steno- sis (e.g., those with major lack of blood flow on exercise or its equivalent, as measured by exercise-induced EKG changes or other methods) may benefit more from PCI than OMT. However, this is controversial and unproven; the Inspire trial did not find such a difference, but this was not an endpoint trial (Mahmarian et al. 2006). In the Inspire trial, medical therapy and PCI had comparable effects on myocardial ischemia, as noted earlier. However, on hard endpoints, the Inspire trial was too small to record enough deaths or heart attacks to be defini- tive. If patients who would benefit from PCI or CABG were pre- selected, progress might be made in the more rational use of PCIand CABG. However, this will not cure the problem of athero- sclerosis, rough plaques, clots, and heart attacks. We must also remember that the use of invasive procedures engenders a large placebo effect in angina studies. PCI and CABG will not be major solutions to the vascular problems in table 1, but their use, with further study, can hopefully be rationalized. Finally, what is really missing for progress in CAD and stroke prevention are better drugs and lifestyle changes to slow or stop the atherosclerotic process. Indeed, as a nation, with the Americanpopulation increasing in weight and the attendant increase in dia- betes, we are going in the wrong direction. (In adult-onset dia- betes, weight control is by far the most important modifiable risk factor.) Notwithstanding these worrying trends in weight, the approaches in tables 3 and 4 have been useful for many people. But, as shown in table 1, there is still a huge burden of heart and cerebrovascular disease in the U.S. population. We need to better understand the atherosclerotic process and then intervene to fix it. Current drugs, although useful\u2014or even the future rational use of PCI and CABG\u2014is not the final solution. /hwysquare Acknowledgments I thank Michiko Spector for her help in manuscript preparation and June Spector, MD, MPH, for her constructive criticism.

I should also emphasize that acute chest pain (heart attacks) and strokes require immediate medical attention and are not covered in this analysis. Patients with acute chest pain and stroke must seek medical care as soon as possible because there are effective treatments for acute heart attack andstroke. It is worth noting that the risk of sudden out-of-hospital death from car- diac electrical malfunction secondary to heart attack is substantial.

Labeling chiropractic as a nineteenth-century philosophy wearing the white smock of science, the article castigated chiropractors for treating chil- dren for \"legions of childhood afflictions\" (Smith 1993). A year later, on February 4, 1994, ABC's 20/20 aired \"Han - dle with Care,\" an episode based on secretly videotaped visits to the offices of seventeen chiropractors who treated ear infections in children. All of the chiropractors offered treatment lasting from several weeks to a lifetime. T reatment methods were based on diagnoses ranging from subluxated vertebrae to nutritionaldeficiency, weak glands, food sensitivity, and a short leg.Should Chiropractors T reat Children? Parents should be made aware of possible risks associated with chiropractic treatment of children, particularly the services offered by \"pediatric chiropractors.\" SAMUEL HOMOLA 50 Volume 34, pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:42 PM Page 50Chiropractic treatment of children has not been curtailed by such bad publicity. Today, building on a program that began in 1993, the International Chiropractic Association of -fers a postgraduate \"Diplomate in Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics\" (DICCP) and publishes the \"peer reviewed\"Journal of Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics. The diplomate pro- gram is a thirty-module, 360-plus-hour classroom course that takes place during weekends over a three-year period. There isno hospital training and no contact with diseased or injured children\u2014only a \"mandatory observational/training weekend at a chiropractic center for special needs children under multi- disciplinary care\" (ICA Council 2009). Both American chiropractic associations endorse chiroprac- tic care for children. In a June 2008 joint press release, forexample, the American Chiropractic Association's (ACA)Coun cil on Chiropractic Pediatrics and the Council on Chiro -practic Pediatrics of the International Chiropractors Associa -tion (ICA) announced that the DICCP is now recognized bythe ACA and its council as the official credential for special- ization in chiropractic pediatrics (ACA 2007). Noting increasing public support for chiropractic treat- ment of children, a January 2009 press release from the ACAoffered this observation: \"Survey data indicates that the per- centage of chiropractic patients under 17 years of age hasincreased at least 8.5 percent since 1991. ... Studies are begin- ning to show that chiropractic can help children not only withtypical back and neck pain complaints, but also with issues as varied as asthma, chronic ear infections, nursing difficulties, colic and bedwetting\" (ACA 2009). A trend toward greater use of chiropractic by children has not gone unnoticed by the medical profession. An article inthe January 2007 issue of Pediatrics (the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics) described chiropractic as themost common complementary and alternative medicine prac-tice used by children, who made an estimated thirty millionvisits to U.S. chiropractors in 1997 (Vohra 2007). In 1998,children and adolescents constituted 11 percent of patient vis- its to chiropractors (Lee 2000). Promoting a broad scope of practice for chiropractors who treat children, the ICA Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics offers links to abstracts from chiropractic journals that support chiropractic treatment for a variety of childhood ailments(ICA Pediatrics 2009). Chiropractors commonly claim to have an effective treatment for otitis media, asthma, allergies, infan- tile colic, and enuresis. While many of the pediatric conditions treated by chiropractors are self-limiting, treatment is offered for such serious conditions as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, myas- thenia gravis, uveitis, ADHD, and Tourette's syndrome. For the most part, treatment for all these conditions is based upon detection and correction of vertebral misalignment (subluxa- tion) or spinal joint dysfunction plex). An article titled \"The Child Patient: A Matrix for Chiro - practic Care\" in the Journal of Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics, for example, stated that \"any alteration in form or function in the child may signal the presence of subluxation, and the sub- luxation may in turn alter the physiology of the child\" (Fallon2005). For wellness and preventive care, parents are advised that children should be checked for subluxations by a chiro- practor six to twelve times per year (Fallon 2005). A 2009 survey of chiropractors and parents of chiropractic pediatric patients, conducted by the International Chiro - practic Pediatric Association, revealed that \"the indicated pri- mary reason for chiropractic care of children was 'wellness care'\" (Alcantara 2009). The reasons given for such care wouldindicate that normal spines of healthy children are being manipulated for \"subluxation correction.\" There is no credible evidence to support the contention that subluxation correction will restore or maintain health orthat such subluxations even exist (College 1996; Mirtz 2009). Chiropractic journals publish hundreds of subluxation-based studies supporting chiropractic treatment for children but only a few studies disputing such treatment. Most medical researchers feel that claims based on the chiropractic vertebralsubluxation theory do not have sufficient basis to warrant investigation. But such claims should not go unchallenged, especially when they involve treatment of children. Contrary Opinions To date, legitimate properly controlled studies have failed to sup- port the claims of chiropractors who treat children for organic ailments. In the case of asthma, for example, a randomized, con- trolled trial of chiropractic spinal manipulation for children with mild or moderate asthma published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that \"the addition of chiropractic spinal manipulation to usual medical care provided no benefit\" (Balon1998). A randomized, controlled trial of infantile colic treated with chiropractic spinal manipulation, published in a 2001 issue of Archives of Diseases in Childhood ,concluded that \"chiropractic spinal manipulation is no more effective than placebo in the treatment of infantile colic\" (Olafdottir 2001). A recent system- atic review of randomized clinical trials concluded that \"there is Samuel Homola is a retired chiropractor and a critic of the chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory. He feels that chi- ropractic treatment should be limited to mechanical-type neck and back problems and related musculoskeletal prob - lems. His e-mail address is samhomola@comcast.net. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October 2010 51 Photograph by Judith Calson/San Jose Mercury NewsSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:42 PM Page 51no good evidence to show that spinal manipulation is effective for [treating] infant colic\" (Ernst 2009). There is evidence to indicate that soft-tissue manipulative techniques applied over the neck area might aid recovery from secretory otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear) by opening the eustachian tube to facilitate drainage of fluids from the middle ear (Mills 2003). Chiropractors who manip-ulate a child's neck to correct subluxations might provide somesymptomatic relief for otitis media by inadvertently stretchingthe eustachian tube. But the risk of such treatment would out-weigh any possible benefit. (Although otitis media is normally self-limiting, it should be kept under observation by a pedia- trician who can prescribe antibiotics, if needed, when there isacute otitis media with bacterial infection. Otitis media com-monly occurs in children under three years of age. As the childgrows older, an increase in the length and angle of theeustachian tube reduces chances of bacteria or viruses travelingfrom the throat to the middle ear.) Considering the implausibility of the chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory, there is good reason to question the ability ofchiropractors to diagnose and treat childhood ailments. A correctdiagnosis notwithstanding, there is no evidence to support thebelief that manipulating the spine of a child to correct vertebralsubluxations would be appropriate treatment. A 1993 risk-ben-efit analysis of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for relief oflumbar or cervical pain, published in Online Neurosurgery , advised neurosurgeons that \"potential complications and unknown benefits indicate that SMT should not be used in thepediatricpopulation\" (Powell 1993). Considering the damage that manipulation might do to cartilaginous growth centers, there is no known justificationfor using spinal manipulation on an infant or a preadolescent child. Yet, many chiropractors recommend that the spine of a newborn baby be adjusted at birth to correct subluxations. According to the ICA Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics, \"chiropractic care can never start too early\" (ICA Home 2009). Generally, pediatricians classify a child as being under eigh- teen years of age\u2014before vertebral end plate growth is com- plete. In a child under the age of eight to ten years, the carti- laginous growth centers are too immature and too vulnerable to injury to be subjected to spinal manipulation. There is somespeculation that injury to growth plates might result in spinal deformity (such as scoliosis or Scheuermann's kyphosis) as growth progresses (O'Neal 2003). Such injury might not bedetectable. \"The incidence of subtle growth plate fractures fol- lowing high-velocity [manipulation] techniques in children issurely under-appreciated because of the occult nature of these injuries\" (O'Neal 2003). The cartilaginous, flexible spine of a child is not as easily in - jured as an adult's spine under normal circumstances. Referred pain caused by organic disease is not commonly experienced by children. When back pain in a child does occur, it is potentially more serious than back pain in an adult and should always be brought to the attention of a board-certified pediatrician. Although spinal manipulation has the potential to injure the spine of a child, few such injuries have been reported in the literature. A systematic review of thirteen studies, published up to June 2004, uncovered fourteen significant manipula-tion-related injuries in children up to eighteen years of age, nine of which were serious (e.g., subarachnoidal hemorrhage, paraplegia) and two of which were fatal (one child died froma brain hemorrhage and another from dislocation of the atlas following neck manipulation). Ten of the injuries were attrib- uted to manipulation done by chiropractors, one to manipu-lation by a physiotherapist, and one to manipulation by a medical doctor; two injuries were caused by unspecified providers of manipulation. In twenty cases of harm caused by delayed diagnosis as a result of using manipulation, seven involved a delayed diagnosis of cancer; two children died because of delayed treatment for meningitis (Vohra 2007). The incidence of spinal injuries in children is reported to be 2 to 5 percent of all spine injuries (Hayes 2005). A Questionable Approach High-velocity, low-amplitude thrusting, commonly used bychiropractors, is usually the type of manipulation that injures a child's spine. Most chiropractors who manipulate an infant's spine may simply use light thumb pressure to \"adjust\" an allegedly misaligned vertebra, thus reducing possibility of injury. Although such treatment may be harmless, it has noknown beneficial effect other than the calming effect of humantouch. Some chiropractors may use a spring-loaded stylus or an electrically powered mallet in an attempt to tap vertebrae into alignment. Chiropractors who adjust newborn babies to correct subluxations may concentrate on the upper cervical (neck) area of the spine. The upper neck is more likely to be injured by delivery during birth and is most vulnerable to injury caused bymanipulation. Pediatricians have observed that \"the most com- mon traumatically injured region of the immature spine is the first and second cervical vertebrae\" (O'Neal 2003). There is no credible evidence that chiropractors are able to find subluxations in the spine of an infant. It seems unlikely that a chiropractor could detect vertebral misalignment by pal- pating the flexible, cartilaginous spine of an infant through a thick layer of baby fat. I have always suspected that chiroprac- tors who say they can use their fingertips to feel subluxations in a baby's spine are either deceiving themselves or misinter- preting what they feel. Some chiropractors use surface electromyography, thermog- raphy, leg-length checks, or some other questionable device orI have always suspected that chiroprac- tors who say they can use their finger- tips to feel subluxations in a baby's spine are either deceiving themselves or misinterpreting what they feel. 52Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL pgs_SI 4:42 PM Page subluxations. It goes without saying that chi- ropractors should not expose a child to unnecessary radiation by x-raying his or her spine in a search of elusive or nonexistentsubluxations. In Canada, the Alberta Society of Radiology hasrecommended that radiologists refuse requests from chiroprac-tors who ask for diagnostic imaging of any type involving chil- dren aged eighteen years or younger (Editorial 1998). Of all the claims made by chiropractors, I regard the claims made by those who treat children to be the most problematic.I have always advised against manipulating the spine of a small child or a newborn baby for any reason. Manipulation of the spine of an adolescent child under the age of eighteen should be done in concert with an evaluation and a diagnosis pro- vided by an orthopedist, preferably a pediatric orthopedic spe-cialist. Caring for children is very different from caring foradults and requires a special expertise. Board-certified medical and osteopathic pediatricians are best qualified to provide ap - propriate care based on a correct diagnosis. Although spinal manipulation is often recommended as a treatment for back pain, this recommendation does not oftenapply to children. When the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published guidelines suggesting that spinal manipulation might be helpful in treating low back pain with-out radiculopathy (sciatic pain) when used within the first month of symptoms, its recommendations did not apply to children younger than eighteen years of age \"since diagnostic and treatment considerations for this group are often different than for adults\" (Bigos 1994). An adolescent child might ben- efit from appropriate manipulation designed to relieve symp- toms caused by uncomplicated, mechanical-type back prob- lems, but only if a definitive diagnosis has been provided by an orthopedist or a pediatrician. Use of unnecessary spinal manipulation in the treatment of children up to eighteen years of age for subluxation correction may delay appropriate treat- ment based on a correct diagnosis. Some chiropractors believe that manipulating a child's spine will stimulate the immune system and help prevent infection. On September 8, 2009, for example, the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal and Family Health Chiropractic issued a press release titled \"Chiropractic Part of Swine Flu Prevention Program in Children.\" The editor of the journal recommended that all chil-dren should be checked for vertebral subluxations before andduring the flu season: \"Since the nervous system has a direct effect on the immune system and because the spine houses and protects so much of the nerve system it is important to have your child's spine checked for any interference\" (McCoy 2009). Such extreme views find support in the basic definition of chiro practic and in official chiropractic publications. The National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, for example, advises that \"psychoneuroimmunology has revealed an interrelationship between the central nervous system and immunity (consistent with chiropractic philosophy). ... By manually manipulating vertebrae into their normal physiological relationship, chiroprac- tic practitioners relieve interference with the nervous system along with accompanying symptoms.\" Thus, \"chiropractic man- agement of childhood disorders primarily consists of adjusting concomitant spinal subluxations and providing specific nutri-tional advice and/or support and other palliative measures\" (Christensen 2005). All things considered, it's an understatement to say that \"pedi- atric chiropractic care is often inconsistent with recommended medical guidelines\" (Lee 2000). Recommendation of any com- plementary alternative medicine (CAM) therapy that has a risk-benefit ratio that is not acceptable and is not supported in medical literature may make a referring physician liable for neg- ligence if the referral causes harm by delaying necessary conven- tional treatment (Cohen 2005). For this reason, and with the best interest of children in mind, few physicians would considerreferring a child to a chiropractor. /hwysquare References ACA Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics. 2007.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER October 2010 MJ 2010 7/22/10 4:42 PM Page 53Paranormal Beliefs and Schizophrenia JONATHAN C. SMITH Are true believers in the paranormal crazy? Few scholars would seri-ously embrace this extreme char- acterization. However, there is a type of\"crazy thinking\" that is worth exploring.Let me explain. Schizophrenia is a serious mental dis- order characterized by distortions in per-ception of reality, disorganized speech andthinking, and serious deterioration of theability to function with others. Contraryto popular myth, hear auditory hallucinations are rela-tively common even among perfectly nor-mal people. Often, schizophrenics claimtheir voices and perceptual distortionscome from outside sources, like spacealiens, CIA operatives, therapists, theirmothers, and so on, trying to control theirthoughts. Why do such delusions emerge? One popular theory is that terrified and confusedschizophrenics try to make some sense out of a frightening world byconcluding that the voices come from an outside source, like space aliens. Atleast this explanation reduces some of the anxious uncertainty of not knowing what's going on. When such explana- tions are challenged or don't fit apparent reality (no flying saucers are found), the patient patches up the false belief so it is still believable. Logically, there are only a few ways to do this. First, you can conclude you are very special, a truly unique person, the only one who has paranormal abilities that enable you to hear these voices. Second, you can conclude that your voices could be heard by others if some externalparanormal force or agency wasn't pre- venting it. These two explanations mayaccount for why some schizophrenics havedelusions of grandeur (\"I'm unique and special\") or embrace delusional conspiracy theories (\"God, fate, negative energies,space aliens, and the CIA are blockingothers from seeing the evidence\"). I propose that perfectly sane, intelli- gent, and honest true believers in theparanormal\u2014those who refuse to ques-tion or use sensible tools of critical think- ing\u2014possess a similar thinking process. For example, Sue might believe that shehas been abducted by space aliens. Maybeone night she woke up paralyzed and saw the dark figure of a space creature that stood by her bed, touched her, and took her breath away. Of course, there may benumerous alternative explanations: per- haps Sue experienced a sleep-related hal- lucination, misinterpreted a shadow, or has faulty memory. Maybe there is a nat-ural explanation, one that current tech-nology can't measure. However, Sue is convinced that her alien experience is real and can't be explained through science\u2014that it was a paranormal event. Sue looks for reassur-ing answers. Like the schizophrenic, she has two choices. One possibility is that she is unique and special. Sue may then seek out otherswho have had similar experiences and form a unique and special group, some- thing like the \"Church of the Abductee.\" Their core belief is that space aliens haveselected them to communicate with thepeople of Earth. (Every decade or so another odd and occasionally deadly fly- ing saucer cult em erges; one has evenbecome a world religion.) Alternatively, Sue (and her abductee friends) might favor an external explana-tion. There are two popular external Jonathan C.

Perhaps scientificskepticism or the cold atmosphere of a science lab emits a certain paranormal\"negativity\" that blocks alien energy orscares the poor, sensitive aliens away. Maybe such skepticism annoys the aliens. Similar explanations are often given for why scientific and objective evidence for paranormal phenomena islacking. Second, evidence for alienabductions eludes scientists and experts because there is a conspiracy amongthose in power to keep us in the dark.Who is part of this conspiracy? Perhapsthe U.S. government, the CIA, religious authorities, or the scientific commu-nity\u2014or maybe even a medical commu- nity fearful that doctors would be putout of business if the common man hadaccess to alien medicine. To be consis- tent, we would have to conclude that ifthe conspirers were any good, even thiswould be unclear. Like the schizophrenic, Sue may be motivated to \"patch up\" her beliefs when confronted with conflicting evi- dence. She may spin a never-ending webof ad hoc rationalizations that render her claims unfalsifiable. For the schizo-phrenic, such efforts help protect againstfears of the unknown. Both a paranor- mal believer and a schizophrenic can create belief systems of exquisite com- plexity, rivaling ancient charts of astrol- ogy and acupuncture. Delusional sys-tems can acquire a life of their own, pro- tected from critical assessment through their own complexity.Sane, intelligent, educated, honest, and perfectly decent people are quitecapable of experiencing profound delu- sions and distortions. They include your favorite professors, preachers, and friends\u2014even your mother. They canbelieve in their delusions and distor-tions with convincing and authentic intensity. These people are not crazy.And the fact that many may have had the same experience proves nothing. One thousand people seeing the same mysterious flying-saucer-like light over Kansas proves nothing. One thousand people seeing the Virgin Mary in a stain on a Chicago freeway embankment (or a grilled-cheese sandwich) proves noth- ing. People have believed in the curses of witches for many millennia and puthundreds of thousands of \"witches\" todeath. Extra ordinary beliefs can have extraordinary consequences. The schizophrenic may embrace para - normal explanations in a desperate at - tempt to reduce the terrors of a mysteri- ous medical illness. For those blessed with at least a modicum of sanity, the tools of critical thinking give some chance ofremaining grounded in the world as it is. /hwysquare \u00a9 2010, Jonathan C.

He could have advised the reader to pick up almost any bookon ghosts, demons, spirits, aliens, lakemonsters, crop circles, the chupacabra, or other \"strange and bizarre\" things.The bar for paranormal investigation in the popular media has been set very low, as evidenced by the overall poor qualityof work produced so far. Radford hopes to raise the bar by clarifying and exem-plifying the standards that should guide a scientific investigator. Fortunately, not all paranormal in - vestigations have been of poor quality. Radford, Joe Nickell\u2014the dean of scien- tific paranormal investigation\u2014and sev- eral others have been exemplars for those who wish to properly investigate paranor- mal claims. A special feature of Radford's book is that it consists largely of case studies he has personally investigated. The reader can see how the principles ofinvestigation are applied to actual para- normal claims. But the main value of Radford's book is that he lays out what should and should not be done in a proper scientific investigation. (Radfordregularly reports on his field investiga- tions and other skeptical topics in the S KEPTICALINQUIRER. He is SI'smanag- ing editor and a Committee for Skep - tical Inquiry research fellow.) Radford tells the reader that his book \"focuses on the practical aspects ofapplied skepticism ... powerful, real- world ideas for critically examining everything from crime scenes to psychic powers to personal decisions.\" Theseideas have been drawn \"largely from the scientific process, psychology, criminal investigation techniques, and logic.\" As such, the ideas Radford explores in the first few chapters have valuable applica- tions be yond paranormal investigations.Scien tific Paranormal Investigation would be a valuable addition to the library of every journalist and skeptic. But the thou- sands of people who investigate weird or mysterious things and the millions of readers and viewers who follow their in - vestigations would benefit the most. I won't relieve the lazy reader of the obligation to read Radford's book by summarizing the principles of a proper scientific investigation. Here I will sim- ply note that the goal of a proper inves-tigation of the paranormal is neither to prove nor disprove any particular claim. Radford puts it this way: \"Good scienceis not about advocacy; while all scien- tists have their biases and pet theories, their ultimate loyalty should be to the truth.\" If you set out to prove or dis- prove the existence of a ghost at a par- ticular location, you are not doing a sci- entific investigation. If the show you arewatching or the book you are reading does not consider alternative hypothe- ses, it is not conducting scientific inves- tigation. If an author claims that the subject of his attention or investigation is \"beyond science,\" you're dealing with mysticism, not mysteries.

Understanding evolution is es - sential to understanding modern biol-ogy as well as a host of other subjects.We need to get to young minds before their neurons have a chance to congeal into unscientific ideologies. Now we have just the book to reach them. Daniel Loxton is the editor of the \"Junior Skeptic\" section of Skepticmaga- zine, where he makes skepticism andcritical thinking accessible and entertain- ing to the younger set. He has expanded one of his \"Junior Skeptic\" subjects into a superb new book on evolution. The illustrations are colorful, infor- mative, and whimsical. Loxton intro- duces us to a blue bird that compro- mises on a tail that is \"not too long, not too short,\" some cute \"Zooks\" that move away and eventually lose the inter- est and ability to mate with the others, a boy overrun with bunnies that have reproduced without anything to limit survival of the offspring, and some reallycool dinosaurs. They're a joy to the eye, and the text is a joy to the mind.Loxton covers the basics of evolu- tionary theory; tells the story of Darwin, the Beagle, and the finches; and answers the questions people commonly ask: \"But have we ever actually seen a new species evolve?\" Yes, both in the wild and in the lab. \"Where are the transitional fossils?\" Everywhere. \"Didn't they find some human foot- prints together with dinosaur foot- prints?\" No, they made a mistake. \"How could evolution produce some- thing as complicated as my eyes?\" Lox - ton shows us how complex eyes gradu- ally developed from simple light-sensi- tive cells. \"How could walking animals turn into flying animals?\" Perhaps from grad- ual alterations in tree-dwelling, gliding animals. Then the hard questions: \"How did life start in the first place?\" Evolution doesn't explain the origin of life, just how it changed over time. We don't know how life got started, but scientists are working on it. And \"What about religion?\" Loxtonhandles this neatly by saying that this is a question science can't help with. He refers readers to their \"family, friends, and community leaders.\" (He avoids mentioning rabbis, imams, priests, or Flying Spaghetti Monsterologists.) Loxton has a wonderful knack for simplifying without condescending and for challenging young readers to grapple with complicated concepts. The book is aimed at eight-to thirteen-year-olds, but it could be useful to even a sophisti-cated old coot. Some of his examples might come in handy in your next dis- cussion with an intelligent design be - liever or a fence sitter. I loved his illus-tration of how evolutionary change isnot a totally random process but buildson patterns that were already there. He describes how hot-rod builders can lift a car, drop it, chop the roof, and slap on new paint, but they are still stuck with the basic pattern of a body and four wheels (not two or seventeen). If you have children or grandchil- dren, this book would be a great way tointroduce them to the theory of evolu- tion. If you don't, you still might want tobuy a copy, read it yourself, and donate itto the local public or school library. I hope Loxton will write many more books like this on a wide variety of skep- tical subjects. He has a gift, and we arefortunate that he is sharing it with us. /hwysquare Harriet Hall is a physician and SI contributing editor who writes prolifically about pseudo- science and questionable medical practices. stand them. A book or film on such top- ics would be very short, unless it con-tains much speculation and storytelling.Paranormal claims are investigated pre-cisely because they both mystify us and present themselves as mysteries we can hope to solve. Unfortunately, too many people who try to investigaterather than validate or debunk paranormal claims are unpre-pared to do a proper investigation. Theymay have good intentions, but the road to error is paved with good intentions.Having the right tools is essential, but as Radford makes painfully clear, you can't buy the most important tools you need. You can't pick them up in a weekend training session. It takes years of hard work to develop the knowledge and skillsneeded to be a scientific paranormal investigator. Contrary to what you mightsee on television, an abundance of scien-tific gadgets is not as important as knowl- edge of the subject, knowledge of psy- chology, good logical reasoning skills, and an open mind. Radford's book does what a scientific paranormal investigation should do: it helps the reader distinguish the real thing from the fake.

Keller is a call for anyone associated with ancient art to refrain from actively encouraging the wholesale destructionof the world's artistic heritage. Whatdoes it matter to the average museum visitor that much of what is on display is less than genuine? Everyone who looksthe other way is contributing to the pol-lution of scholarship and distortions of history and science. Looting and forgery go hand in hand, destroying culturalpatrimony for profits. Both are drivenby the desire of collectors to have some- thing ancient and the excuse of Western museums that the countries of origincan't protect their heritage. It is true that many local museums are desperately underfunded, but much of what disap-pears from a country is driven by collec-tors' personal acquisitiveness. I worked briefly at a museum in Arica, northern Chile, in 1991. The museum was filled with textiles from mummies from the surrounding area of the Ata - cama Desert that were well preserved because it never rains there. In pre-Inca times, the local population wore lavishly dyed and woven garments. (After the Inca conquest all the decorated textiles were sent to Cuzco for the emperor, and the locals had to wear undecorated plain- weave garments.) Part of the local style were some unusually constructed squarehats. The director, Lilliana Ulloa, then at the University of Tarapaca, described how the museum had been broken intoand their collection of hats stolen. They later showed up in a glossy catalog from a California museum. Some feel that the market in forgeries lessens the pressure on archaeological sites, but it is all part of the same prob- lem. Forgeries authenticated by so-called experts end up in collections and muse- ums, confusing casual visitors and future scholars alike. Misled scholars will createan imagined, fraudulent history. The huge sums of money paid for looted orforged pieces perpetuate the industry. There are all manner of forgeries: fake ceramics, gold objects, wood carvings, and textiles. Some are entirely new cre- ations; some are new ceramics created from authentic old molds using clay from the original sources, then aged in chicken manure; some are new designscarved from ancient wood or new wood chemically aged; and some are all kinds of ancient broken bits and pieces gluedtogether to make something more attrac- tive to a collector. Where does restora- tion end and forgery begin? And who can blame the potters who are makingpots in the traditional way to support their families? Dealers increase the value and profit mightily for themselves when they pass the goods on to the eager col-lector. The potters sometimes know they are being cheated by the dealers, that their creations gain tremendous valueafter they leave their hands, but often have no legal protection and need the money. If the potters sign their work, the identifying marks can be sanded off.Some artisans probably knowingly make forgeries, a practice that began at least asearly as the conquest, when the Spanishclergy urged the natives to give up theiridols. To avoid punishment for failing tohand them over, the local potters pro- duced new pieces. Bruhns and Keller describe the work- shops of several of the families produc-ing ceramics known to have been au - thenticated as ancient, which have ended up in museums and galleries. Some of the craftspeople have been trained at the Bellas Artes in Lima and schools abroad. Their work was in - tended as replicas and may even havebeen signed, but they have no controlover it after it leaves their hands.Although the work can be finely de - signed and crafted, it cannot receive therecognition it deserves because muse- ums and collectors will not pay for mod- ern interpretations; they want only theold stuff. In the Indian Market in Lima, I bought one of the Nazca pieces illus- trated on page 97 of Bruhns and Keller's book, described there as being sold andbought as a genuine antiquity. In Ica, I saw for sale in a museum shop what I now believe must also have been a piece by one of the artists mentioned in the book. They were anomalies because Icahad almost no crafts for sale, and these pieces were impressive in both price andquality. Sadly, I wasn't tempted to buyone because the price was so much higher than for the ceramic items in the markets in Lima. It is a pity that so many of these forg- eries are taken seriously. Bruhns and Keller do a good job of explaining why. There is tremendous pressure and incen- tive throughout the museum industry to pass off these fakes as genuine. The authenticators earn a percentage of the appraised value of an object when it issold, not a flat fee. Authentication is often based on intuition, not science. Scientific technology, where available for dating, is expensive, cumbersome, often requires a bit of the item to be destroyed for data, and can be fooled bythe genuine bits in a pot that is a collage of restored shards. Museums often don'twant to know the number of forgeries in their collections, and looted pieces come with a dubious provenance. Curators are unwilling to acknowledge fakes in their collections because the public wouldThe Faked Artifact Business CAROL HAYMAN Faking the Ancient Andes. By Karen O. Bruhns and Nancy L. Keller.

His magnum opus, The Selfish Gene, influenced a whole generation of scientists and freethinkers, while works such as The God Delusionare at the pinnacle of esteem for atheists who may be struggling to find their way out ofthe closet. Dawkins's newest book, appropriately titled The Greatest Show on Earth , intro- duces the concept of evolution to the general public. With recent books such as Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution is True , Daniel Loxton's Evolution: How We and All Living Things Came to Be ,and Donald Prothero's Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters , it seems almost a rite of passage to communicate the vast set of ideas and evidence about evolution to the public in simple, comprehensible terms. Dawkins has his own \"patterned\" way of making even the most complicated con- cepts understandable. With the gut-wrenching over-abundance of evolutiondeniers in the United States, it is nice to see the scientific community at its best in combating such myths. The greatest show on Earth is, without a doubt, evolution. Dawkins entices thereader into subjects including genetics,embryology, paleontology, anatomy, andmolecular biology, explaining every com-monly held myth about evolution. Dawkins refers to evolution as a fact andplayfully uses the word theorem, borrowed from mathematics, in place of the seem- ingly contentious word theory when refer- ring to facts that no ordinary person would deny, such as the theory of gravity. Dawkins discusses the complexity of Richard Lenski's research; almost every major mechanism for adaptive evolu- tionary change is demonstrated by Lenski's work in building phylogenetic trees through molecular genetics. Just as impressive is Dawkins's case for \"bad design\" in nature (the opposite of what you would expect from a benevolent creator), in which he contrasts the pro -cess of natural selection (which entails modifying the materials already present) with the process of building an airplane from scratch. A notorious example of\"bad design\" offered by Dawkinsis the male urethra passing through the prostate gland, resulting in frequent blockages. What may be the most enlightening chapter of the book is ironically titled \"There Is Grandeur in This View of Life,\" after Charles Darwin's lyrical crescendo. Dawkins dissects each line ofthis peroration while further imprinting the main concepts of evolution into the reader's mind. Bits of this dissection include the irrelevance of morality to evolutionary discussions, the lack ofneed for an omnipotent designer, thedescent of all living things from a single ancestor, the fact that organisms are fixed to the environment, and the evolu-tion of evolvability. Dawkins notes that his book is not only for evolution deniers but for all academics and nonacademics alike. It is also aimed at those who could use morethought-provoking material with which to educate friends and family about the marvels of evolution. Dawkins does not disappoint. I highly recommend The Greatest Show on Earth. /hwysquarelose faith in the museums, reputations would be tarnished, and donors would stop donating. Bruhns and Keller also mention the somewhat racist idea that \"primitive\" art isn't real art anyway. The book gives numerous references to art books and museum and auctioncatalogs, but few are reproduced; perhaps they were refused copyright permission. The index and references could be more extensive, and the book contains someomissions. For example, the authors saythat \"there is a giant and rather hilariousliterature on the supposed uses and beliefs surrounding mirrors\" (p. 151), but they don't inform readers where tolook for it for our amusement; theauthors also write that the \"idea thatSpondylas was brought to southern Peru by shaman-traders is also ludicrous, given what is known about the structure of exchange in ancient Peru\" (157). Well, what is known about exchange back then? Inquiring minds would like to know. Faking the Ancient Andes will appeal to readers of the S KEPTICALINQUIRERbe - cause the authors come down firmly onthe side of science. In addition to the fine art market, they offer a discussion of the\"lunatic fringe of collectionism.\" This profitable market caters to the demand for artifacts showing humans, dinosaurs, and extraterrestrials as contemporaries, aswell as the extreme diffusionists who wish to prove that the Chinese, Welsh, or a lost tribe of Israel reached the new worldbefore Colum bus. It is an industry sup- ported by the credulous. There is a companion volume on Mesoamerica that is probably equallyenlightening. A final word of advice from the authors: \"As you stare long- ingly at ...the dazzling golden artifact in the dealer's window, stop and think for a moment before you buy it. If it is authentic, you are as much a grave- robber as the huaquero who dug it up, and if it's not, then you are about to be swindled.

The continuing debate over global cli- mate change has included charges that some scientists who have concluded that human behavior is a significant cause of global warming have selectively presented only data and arguments that supporttheir presuppositions. In the midst of that furor, a December 2009 Rasmussen Re - ports poll found that 59 percent of Americans think it is \"somewhat likely\" or\"very likely\" that climate scientists have falsified data to fit their own opinionsabout global warming. (Subsequent inves- tigations determined that the accusationswere unfounded [see SI, July/August2010].) In May 2010, the doctor who con- vinced millions of parents worldwidethat a common vaccine for children could cause autism was barred from practicing medicine in his native Britain. The doctor's peer-reviewedstudy in the respected journal The Lancet was widely discredited when it was found to be based on unethical behavior, and other studies found no link between the vaccine and autism. David Goodstein has been a profes- sor of physics for more than forty years at the California Institute of Tech - nology, and in 1988 he became Caltech's vice provost. On Fact and Fraud focuses primarily on cases in which Goodstein was involved during his career. Caltech's Policy on Research Miscon duct, whichhe drew up, is included as an appendix. It is important to be aware that fraud in science, regardless of whatever other negative connotations it may have, is a violation of the scientific method. In almost all recent cases of scientific fraud, three motives have been present. Career pressure is a motivating factor. Goodstein stumbles when he asserts that \"all scientists at all levels, from fame toobscurity, are pretty much always under career pressure\" (p. 4). It seems that he is unfamiliar with the many institutions of higher education at which, once tenure issecured, many faculty feel no publishableresearch pressure at all. In fact, at some institutions faculty are encouraged tofocus on teaching and service and may even be discouraged from spending timeon research. And further on, Goodstein acknowledges that faculty who do not have positions at research universities often opt out of research (22). A second motive for fraud is \"know- ing the answer,\" which refers to those who think they know how the research would come out if it were actually done properly; they decide that it is not nec- essary to go to the trouble of doing itproperly. If a scientist believes that his or her fraudulent research is very unlikely to be repeated by others, this factor may moti- vate the scientist to submit it for publi- cation. Goodstein points out that stud- ies are seldom repeated by others, and in biology exact reproducibility of results is often thought impossible. T wo important components of the scientific research enterprise are the reward system and the authority struc- ture. The reward system deals with scien-tific glory, fame, and reputational immortality. Goodstein outlines the eleven steps leading to the pinnacle of the reward system. The authority struc- tureinvolves power and influence. The first of the cases of alleged fraud or misconduct Goodstein describes is that of the physicist Robert A. Milli kan.Millikan was accused of cheating with respect to data he published and thenlying about it. At Caltech in the late 1980s, two ap - parently unrelated instances of re search misconduct in one of its biology laborato- ries surfaced. In one instance, Vipin Ku - mar had faked a figure in one of his pub- lished articles and also made misleadingstatements in another published article.Kumar was fired from his postdoctoralposition. The other researcher, James Ur - ban, disappeared from the scientific scene. The high-profile case of virologists Robert Gallo and David Baltimore illus- trates, Goodstein says, the poor attemptby the federal government to address sci- entific misconduct. The question re -garding Gallo was whether his lab had wrongly claimed credit for discovering the AIDS virus. A colleague of Balti more was accused by a postdoctoral student of falsi- fying data that were published in an arti-cle of which Baltimore was listed as one ofthe authors. But Baltimore himself was never charged with any wrong doing. Neither Gallo nor Baltimore was found guilty of misconduct. Many readers will doubtless recall the media coverage of Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons's announcement in 1989 that they had induced nuclear fusion reactions on their laboratory bench\u2014cold fusion. Others raced to replicate the achievement but could notdo so. Within a matter of months, the claim was discredited. Goodstein dis- cusses whether Fleischmann and Ponswere guilty of scientific misconduct or self-delusion. T wo cases of high-profile cheating in physics, by Jan Hendrik Schon at Bell Labs and Victor Ninov at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, conclude the examples of scientific cheating ormisconduct.

He has a reputation for treatinghis subjects respectfully but with kind- hearted humor, and he lives up to that reputation in this film. He traveled allover the earth posing to wildly diverse people the question \"What's the meaning of life?\" along with various other ques- tions that came up, from the purpose ofsex to the basis of morality. This film haspleased some and disappointed others. I can say that while it has its flaws, it also has its virtues and uses. First, the bad: I found his trek com- pletely disorganized and random. Though after a second viewing (and rethinking conversations I had with him when heinterviewed me for the documentary a few years ago) I realized that was partly the point; what he found was completely disorganized and random. The movie reflects humanity. Also, no conclusions are drawn and no loose ends tied up. It's a film without a resolution or any coherent theme other than the obvious: there is so much overconfident disagreement on themost fundamental issues of life that humans clearly need to get a clue. Though one major defect of the film isthat it doesn't explore whyanyone believes what they assert in the movie (more on that below), it's evident from what ispre- sented that most of these people (which means most people ) pay little attention to evidence and logic when deciding what the answers are. I also wanted to hearmore about how he found and chose the people he interviewed. The collection is surprising, ranging from Mormon sci-fi author Orson Scott Card to unheard-ofgurus in India to nuclear physicists at Oxford and wildly beyond. But clearly with so much to show, elements of back- story had to be sacrificed. Now the good: The Nature of Existence is more intelligent than Religulous and nicer than The God Who W asn 't There with dryer, kinder humor. It's also morerespectful of its subjects and their faiths (with some well-deserving exceptions). This film is tailor-made to be enjoyed by believers as much as nonbelievers and thus won't please religion-bashers. Nygard lets people of a dozen different faiths sim- ply speak for themselves without any Michael Moore \"gotcha\" tactics, and he leaves the audience to draw their own conclusions. Nygard captures the views of religious fanatics, scientists, and even a seven-year-old girl. And not just Westerners\u2014he travels to India and China, too. It's a snapshot of humanity. I am quoted once in the film (very briefly). Nygard found me because Iwrote the popular underground book Sense and Goodness without God , in which I confront the meaning of life from a god- less perspective and advocate constantquestioning, exploration, and answering of the big questions, from which Nygard's film takes a cue. My book takes a scien- tific and philosophical approach that is systematic and comprehensive. Nygard's film takes the ap proach most people actu- ally take: asking the self-proclaimed experts of different views what they think. That's not to say that many actually travelthe world to do this (as Nygard astonish- ingly does\u2014pay close attention to how global this film is and ponder what it tookfor Nygard to make it). But most people do something similar, on a local level, viathe Internet and multicultural reading. Their experience is likely to be as shallow as this film. But like this film, there is a great deal of depth under the surface waiting to be explored. After you know other views are out there, you can never go back to thinking yours is the only way of thinking. And that's this film's biggest asset. You will see and hear more opinions from more diverse people on the big questions of life than you likely everwould have otherwise, even by copious reading. And most seem as sane (or as crazy) as everyone else. You'll often see yourself in these others who think entirely different things. It will force you to ask: are you just like them? If all these people are wrong (and because they dis- agree, almost all of them have to be), odds are, you are wrong too. So how dofound to have published false data a number of times. The last case Goodstein considers is that of Karl Alexander Muller and J. Georg Bednorz, who in 1986 were working in a field about which most researchers had given up hope; they dis-covered high-temperature superconduc- tivity. Their discovery was first greeted with some disbelief but then accepted when replicated by others. Goodstein says the \"take-home les- son in all of this is that scientific fraud consists of an explicit and well-definedact: faking or fabricating data or plagiar - ism\" (132). This book is accessible to the general reading public, although some readers may not be very interested in the descriptions of some subjects, like high- temperature superconductivity.

(I leave aside their speculations as evolutionary psy- chologists regarding both the origin of reli- gion and the nature of the brain.) According to them, religion will endure \"as long as life generates problems\" because religion pro- vides answers and relief to problems. Thiswould make sense only if there were some problems that must be resolved and if reli- gion were the only way to resolve them. The only problems the authors discuss that seem remotely related to the category of \"problems that must be resolved\" are what they call \"the malady of nothingness\" and the problem of living with uncertainty. The only uniquething religion offers as a solution to these problems is the promise of an afterlife. The authors don't prove that the promise of an afterlife is the only way to resolve these problems. How could they? There are dozensof ways that humans have found to deal with the uncertainties of life. Hope for an afterlife is just one of those ways. Furthermore, noth- ingness isn't a malady but a solution to a problem for many people: the problem of living a few more years without hope of recovery from the torments of injury, disease, or the ravages of old age. There is no reason to believe that religion's promise of an after- life won't one day be seen as an obstacle to solving the most pressing problem humans have ever faced: the problem of living in a body for dozens of years beyond the pointwhere life can be said to have any meaning. The part of the article I found interest- ing was the part that discussed the various physiological effects of positive socialization. Again, however, the authors fail to establish any necessary connection between these effects and religion. Bob Carroll Davis, California I agree with the authors' basic notion that the success of religion is closely related to the orga- nization and chemistry of the human brain. But I take issue with the notion that religion isthe result of the fear of death and the desire for an afterlife. Many western classical religions such as those of the Greeks and Romans, and even Middle Eastern religions such as ancient Judaism, did not emphasize the afterlife. T o them the dead descended into T artarus or she'ol and lived a dreary, uneventful exis- tence\u2014not something that anyone would desire. Nor did early forms of these religions promise the average person a rewarding life after death. These ideas developed toward the height of the Roman Empire and got their greatest impetus with the birth of Christianity. The original purpose of superstition and religious ritual was to ensure survival in thislife. It was to promote the abundance of game, survival from illness, human fertility, and later the fertility of the fields and the cooperation of the weather. In times when men lived at the mercy of nature, these things were more important than what happens after death. Indeed, many primitive people have rituals to insure that the dead stay dead. The historically new religions such as Christianity and Islam used the idea of the afterlife as a recruitment tool. Only the adherents had a chance at a rewarding after- life; all others were to be punished in Hell. At the same time, Judaism also adopted some of these ideas, although the Jewish reli- gion does not condemn all nonbelievers to Hell or reserve Heaven for believers alone. Jerry Hershberg Torrance, California McGuire and Tiger summarized the evolu- tionary pressures that maintain religious belief in the absence of empirical evidence.However, they also unwittingly illustrated the primacy of belief over rationality in their fail- ure to apply this reasoning to their preferred religious belief, atheism. As they noted, evi- dence of belief in deities and an afterlife dates back at least 70,000 years. Far from being comforting, however, the anthropologicalrecord suggests that those beliefs were an oppressive system for enforcing cultural mores through irrational fear of powerful gods and the uncertainly of a terrifying afterlife. T ribal people throughout Asia, Africa, the Americas, and the Pacific feared punishment from the gods or spirits of the dead. T o free humans from that fear and oppres- sion, the Greek philosopher Epicurus promul- gated a contrary religious belief, atheism,based on the materialism of Democritus. Lucre tius de scribed Epicurus as a benefactor of humanity who freed us from fear of gods L E T T E R S T O T H E E D I T O R 62Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERyou really know you're the lone excep- tion, the only one who just happens tobe right? That's exactly the question posed by The Chris tian Delusion, a new book from Pro metheus Books edited by John Loftus (and to which I contributedtwo chapters), which came out just intime for The Nature of Existence to prove its point: you have to seriously questionwhether you are that exception or justanother human in error. And you can'tanswer that by simply asking experts what they think because they all thinksomething different. You thus need a method that can tell the difference, and you need to apply it. Nygard doesn't do that. He just puts a mirror up to humanity and reveals the problem. Hence it's a movie I would feel comfort- able recommending to religious friends and family. They won't be put off by it. They'll even like it. Yet it will haunt them for years. After I saw the film, I asked Nygard why The Nature of Existence didn't ask the question I kept asking as I watched it: whydo they believe that? I know he has answers in the can (he has several hundred hours of footage that include answers to that very question). There is some addi- tional footage available on the film's Web site (www.thenatureofexistence.com), which may become extras in the eventualDVD release. But the movie doesn't tackle the why. Nygard says that if this film is successful, a sequel will explore that next level. For now, The Nature of Existence just looks in the window to see what's there. /hwysquareSI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/23/10 12:32 PM Page 62and an afterlife by reassuring us of benign annihilation at death. Wishful thinking and intolerance of ambiguity led the Greeks to em brace materialism and atheism, which re - duced nature to comfortingly inanimate chemical reactions. Embracing either theism or atheism in the absence of empirical evidence is equally the result of our fear of ambiguity and uncertainty and is an emotional rather than rational choice. Bruce Greyson Carlson Prof. of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences Director, Division of Perceptual Studies University of Virginia Health System Charlottesville, Virginia \"Brain Science, God Science\" leaves me, ahem, skeptical. The authors suggest that reli- gion is inevitable because it has necessary stress-reducing properties. But some features of a pseudoscientific approach appear in the development of the theory, which is not pre- sented as what it is: speculation about a vaguely defined question. Positive statements (\"like it or not, the brain will continue to secrete religion as long as life generates prob- lems\") suggest a level of certainty inappropri- ate for this more or less \"sitting-around-the- cider-barrel\" discussion. The generality of the conclusion is in no way supported by the loose connections made among seeing famil- iar faces at services, oxytocin, \"the factor of predictability,\" and the persistence of religious belief. Scientific \u00e9lan is added with liberal dis-cussion of brain physiology, hormones, and archaeological data, none of which can be tied to the premise by any ex perimental results. In fact, it could be argued that religious belief and its attendant practice are often causes of stress, as when there are persecu- tions or a particular cult or sect makes unusual demands on its followers\u2014a con- cept that the article fails to address. I wish the authors had adopted a lighter tone. Paul Bedard Port Huron, Michigan While the authors tried to hit the subject ball out of the park, I would call it only a double. First of all, they seem to believe that the brain instinctively creates God or an equiva- lent. This is close to Dean Hamer's concept of a \"God Gene.\" However, he admits that some of the most spiritual people he inter- viewed didn't believe in a deity at all. As apsychologist and the author of a book on evolutionary psychology, I think McGuire and Tiger have missed the point on what our brain does. We have evolved a symbolicbrain that produces symbolic models to understand ourselves and the world we live in ... now and thousands of years ago. Evolutionhas seen fit to tie our beliefs to our emotions and our emotions to our bodily functions. That's why the placebo and nocebo effectsinfluenced our health even before modernmedicine arrived. This was just as important as lessening our anxiety. Religion certainly played and still plays an important role in our lives since medicine can't control death and our models are not sufficient to understand it. But we keep trying! Herman KaganVentura, California I found the article \"Brain Science, God Science\" by Michael McGuire and LionelTiger fascinating. The part that I question is the statement, \"a god or some equivalent is a product of thenormal human brain.\" I can only infer from this that my brain is not \"normal.\" I suppose I can take solace in the fact that nearly 94percent of those who do the heavy lifting in the brains department, the National Acad -emy of Sciences, are also missing a normalbrain. Perhaps a study of these \"abnormal\" brains and why they function as they do might be productive. Charlie Sitzes Bloomington, Indiana The May/June 2010 S KEPTICALINQUIRER discusses the pervasiveness of belief in a god. This should not surprise us. Generations ago, Kurt G\u00f6del used mathematical symbols to demonstrate that every coherent system ofstatements relies on at least one unprovable assumption. Moreover, for us rational humans to make sense of the world, we need to make thatassumption\u2014it is a requirement. The reli- gious among us call that assumption \"God.\" Geoffrey Milos glm@themiloshouse.be Michael McGuire and Lionel Tiger respond: We are grateful for the thoughtful, often angu- lar, and always appropriate responses to our article. In fairness, the zest and variety of com- ments compel a reply longer than the original,which it is not our place to try to produce here. However, it is precisely this range and in - tensity that provide us a sense of justification for the approach we took in \"Brain Science, God Science.\" This approach was to suggest a way of understanding an array of religious and reli- gious-like behavior grounded in new neuro- physiological data and the possible interpreta- tions these data may support. The answers proposed will never cause con- tented stillness in the chapel or evaporation of the chapels themselves. But at least there may be a sturdier-than-ever factual basis for approach- ing such a massive and influential matter as what people and societies conclude about the limits of reality, the geography of mortality, and what the organic brain does amid all this. It's neither easy nor necessary to take sides in favor of one or another facet of an intricate prism, and we didn't want to do that. How ever, sacred buildings and stories and their doubtful and irritated critics all exist and even co-exist color- fully, often with massive impact. Of this we sought to be accountants, not judges. Comets and Mammoths I wish to expand on David Morrison's excel- lent special report (SI, May/June 2010) on the widely publicized claim that a huge bro- ken-up comet collided with Earth just 13,000 years ago, wiping out mammoths, Clovis culture, and so on. As he explains, this poorly supported, speculative scenario is built upon an earlier pseudoscientific trade book by the lead author of the original Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences paper. I wish to add that PBS televised, in spring 2009, an hour-long episode of NOVA sup-porting this incredible hypothesis. Shock - ingly, this program has since been awarded the top prize for a TV science documentary by the American Association for the Advance - ment of Science (AAAS)at its annual meeting in February 2010. Mark Boslough, whose sidebar accompanies Mor rison's article, appears on the NOVA program as the lone skeptic. Most of this flashy show touts theuntenable arguments described by Morrison and purports to show that new evidence from Greenland supports the story. The normal course of science didn't lead to Greenland. Instead, NOVA actually funded the expedition to Greenland, a questionable journalistic practice.I have seen a manuscript submitted to the AAAS journal, Science, which the authors hoped would be published simultaneously with the NOVA broadcast. Indeed, the NOVA producer coauthored the would-be Sciencepaper, seemingly inconsis- L E T T E R S T O T H E E D I T O R SKEPTICAL INQUIRER September / October 2010 63SI Sept/Oct pgs_SI MJ 2010 7/23/10 12:43 PM Page 63tent with requirements that coauthors actually are researchers. The article never appeared in Science , perhaps because it was submitted too late for the usual refereeing and publication processes to meet NOVA's broadcast schedule. Nor has the Greenland paper been published in anypeer-reviewed scientific journal during the subsequent year. It is a travesty that the AAAS has given this unpublished work such a prestigious award. Such august scientific institutions as NOVA, AAAS, and the National Academy have been drawn into a race to the bottom that has been a trend for some time on cable channels and other popular science media. It is sensational, controversial, and increasingly pseudoscientific topics that raise the ratingsand readerships. Whether the hyped research is likely to be correct, was done by unim-peachable researchers, was critically evalu- ated before publication by other experts, and was actually published in a reputable journal all fall by the wayside. Though I am a fellow of the AAAS, my complaint about a process that could make such an award was ignored until I insisted on an answer. The relevant AAAS official thenreplied that the award is made by strictly independent committees of scientists and journalists. The AAAS plays no role. Yetsome entity must appoint the committees and establish criteria. As newspapers, maga- zines, and TV networks increasingly sideline many of the best science journalists in thenation, one wonders if enough remain toserve on such a committee. I fear that we are entering a Dark Age in the reporting and communication of rational science, which bodes ill for scientific literacyof the next generation of Americans. This isnot news to readers of SI, but the AAAS award to NOVA's portrayal of the putativeYounger Dryas comet impact shows that the trend is accelerating and has penetrated some of the most respected institutions of science. Clark R. Chapman Senior Scientist Dept. of Space Studies Southwest Research Institute Boulder, Colorado cchapman@boulder.swri.edu I read with interest David Morrison's discus- sion of the YD impact hypothesis but did stumble a bit over one computation. In com- menting on Richard Firestone's suggestionthat the Carolina Bays formation might have been created by a Tunguska-like event, Morrison writes, \"But calculation of averageimpact frequency suggested that only about one super-T unguska could be expected to hit Earth in the past 13,000 years. The chance of two such extremely unlikely swarm impacts happening within the past few thou- sand years is worse than negligible.\" If he meant, as it seems, that given that T unguska indeed happened, the chance that another such event happened (to form the Carolina Bays) within geologically recent history is therefore really small, then I must take issue. Assuming that the impact proba-bilities in two different years are indepen- dent, the probability of two such events in a few thousand years is indeed very, very low,but the probability of two such events\u2014 given that one event (T unguska) occurs inthat period\u2014is about the same as the uncon-ditional probability of a single event. That is, T unguska does not \"protect\" us from imme- diate future impacts. Paul Hilfinger Department of Electrical Engineering and ComputerSciences University of California, Berkeley David Morrison responds: Clark Chapman's account of the AAAS prize given to a NOVA documentary that provided uncritical support for the speculative YD impact hypothesis is indeed disturbing. As for the NOVAshow itself, it is consistent with a trend in all media to emphasize form over function, even when discussing scientific discoveries. Considered drama, the show was highly successful, illustrat- ing science in action in the spectacular environ- ment of the Greenland icecap. The scientists brave cold and potential danger to collect data, and when the lead scientist finds what he was looking for, he tears up on camera. In effect, this is \"reality TV\" brought to a science program. Such a documentary may well increase public interest in science and inspire students to seek sci- ence careers. The only thing wrong was the sci- ence itself, which was at best problematic and probably simply wrong. Paul Hilfinger correctly criticizes my con- densed discussion of impact probabilities. The point I intended to make was that a Tunguska- type event is seen on Earth only once every few centuries, and a super-Tunguska (large enough to form a shallow crater) is expected no more than once in the past 13,000 years. In contrast, these authors suggest one and perhaps two multi- ple impact events (the Carolina Bays and the YD impact), each of them involving tens of thou- sands of super-Tunguskas. Such huge swarms of super-Tunguska impacts are inconsistent withwhat astronomers know about our planet's cos-mic environment or geologists' understanding of Earth's recent impact history. This is not just improbable; in common usage we would have tocall it impossible. A new twist on the YD impact story is a paper published in Geophysical Research Letters by Andrew Scott and colleagues suggesting an alter-native explanation for the tiny carbonaceous spherules that have been cited as evidence for the YD impact. Scott's team found that these spherules from the YD boundary are indistin- guishable from lightly charred fungal sclerota and \"fecal pellets, probably from termites.\" This hypothesis is described by Richard Kerr in Sci - ence(June 17, 2010) under the headline \"Mammoth-Killer Nothing More Than Fungus and Bug Poop.\" Of course, this interpretation has not been independently verified, but it does appear in a peer-reviewed journal. When Scientists Change Their Minds Regarding my short piece \"When Scientists Actually Change Their Minds,\" accompanyingDavid Morrison's special report on cosmic im - pacts and mammoths (SI, May/June 2010): Another significant new development has caused Wallace Broecker to rethink his posi- tion . . . again. A recent paper in the journal Nature reports evidence for the late ice-age flood of meltwater he had postulated as the Younger Dryas trigger event. Broecker didn'tsee evidence when he flew over the area because he was looking in the wrong place. The floodwaters appear to have gone the opposite direction from what he had expected. Instead of pouring down the St. Lawrence River into the North Atlantic, the new evidence suggests that the flood fol- lowed the Mackenzie River into the Arctic. Broecker is quoted in a Nature news story as saying that the flood \"would solve a bigproblem if it actually happened.\" The best scientists follow the evidence wherever it leads them, and sometimes it turns out to beback where they started. Mark Boslough Albuquerque, New Mexico Winter of Our Discontent Opening the May/June 2010 issue of SI, Iwas astounded to find the following state- ment concerning global warming in Ken - drick Frazier's otherwise informative \"From L E T T E R S T O T H E E D I T O R 64 Volume 34, Issue 5 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERSI Sept/Oct was . .. only a fraction of a percent cooler than the warmest year, 2005.\" Expressing a temperature change as a per- centage is of course completely without mean- ing\u2014the value of the percentage change corre- sponding to a given temperature change will depend on the zero of the temperature scale in use (Celsius or Fahrenheit, for example). Self- styled global warming skeptics might legiti- mately point out that on the Kelvin scale of temperature (i.e., relative to absolute zero, the only really meaningful zero in such matters) the global change of some 0.6 degrees C over the last thirty to thirty-five years is itself only a fraction of a percent of 288 K, the mean tem- perature of the planet. This is not a trivial distinction; it is funda- mental to all informed understanding of cli- mate change. On the very day I received the issue in question I came across Georg Hoff - mann's demolition of Claude All\u00e8gre's The Cli - mate Imposture on www.realclimate.org. In this book the former French minister demonstrates to his own satisfaction that anthropogenic global warming is hogwash. Among his num- berless absurdities, All\u00e8gre ridicules the claim that in a certain period \". . . the global mean temperature rose by 0.6%.\" Hoffmann politely lets this go as a typo; after all, All\u00e8gre may have meant the 0.6 degrees C figure mentioned above. T rue be - lievers in the Big Bad Global Warming Con - spiracy are not so polite and will not hesitate to jump on similar errors in publications like SI, especially in cases like this where the word per- centwas actually spelled out. John Eades John.Eades@cern.ch Kendrick Frazier responds: Touch\u00e9. I should have said fraction of a degree\u2014although I picked up that \"fraction of a percent\" phrase from the text of a NASA pod- cast about data then just released by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, \"2009 Global T emperature Package: Year Tied as Second Hottest,\" January 28, 2010. Here, from an online paper at that same time, is how noted NASA-GISS climate scientist James Hansen and four colleagues put the matter: Figure 1a shows 2009 as the second warmest year, but it is so close to 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, and 2007 that we must declare these years as being in a virtual tie as the second warmest year. The maximum difference among these in the GISS analysis is ~0.03\u00b0C (2009 being the warmest among those years and 2006 the coolest). This range is approxi- mately equal to our 1sigma uncertainty of~0.025\u00b0C, which is the reason for stating that these five years are tied for second warmest. By the way, data show that 2010 is well on its way to becoming even warmer than 2009 (and 1998 and any of those other years mentioned). Bogus Bomb Detectors The dowsing-rod-like bomb detectors used in Iraq and elsewhere (News and Comment, SI, May/June 2010) do work to a certainextent, or they did until they were \"ex posed.\" Remember, the horse Clever Hans really could correctly answer some arithmetical ques- tions. You noted that the devices are \"sensitive to the subconscious hand movements of the operator.\" Operators could be responding sub- consciously to body-language cues of nervous- ness of those carrying bombs and fearful of detection. There is another possible mecha- nism: operators could be responding quite consciously and deliberately by pointing the device at those they believe to be carrying bombs, perhaps with good cause, and yet still fend off accusations of bias or profiling by attributing the response to the device. And a device costing tens of thousands of dollars is more believed in, and therefore works better, than a tree branch. Howard J. Wilk Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Faith and the 9/11 Perpetrators Much has been studied and said of Sep tem - ber 11, including \"Bill Maher: Crank and Comic\" (SI, November/December (\"Maher's Ludi SI, May/June 2010). Sam Harris firmly posits: \"The men who committed the atrocities of September 11 were certainly not 'cowards,' as they were re - peatedly described in the Western media, nor were they lunatics in any ordinary sense. They were men of faith\u2014perfect faith, as it turns out\u2014and this, it must finally be acknowl- edged, is a terrible thing to be\" ( The End of Faith: Religion, T error, and the Future of Reason , 2004, p. 67). David W. Alspaugh Three Lakes, Wisconsin The S KEPTICAL INquIRER sometimes rewards us with articles that are then illustrated in aletter to the editor. In the May/June 2010 issue, Ilkka Pyysi\u00e4inen's article, \"How Reli - gion Resists the Challenge of Science,\" iden- tifies three cultural biases that keep us believ- ing. George Anhang's letter concerning \"Maher's Ludicrous Comment\" illustrates two of those three biases. Maher, referring to 9/11 and our retaliation, claimed lobbing missiles from 2,000 miles away was cowardly; staying in the plane as it hit the building was not. These are \"un-American\" sentiments and thus condemned by conformist bias. ABC cancelling Maher is a perfect case of \" punish- ing for fear of being punished for not punishing .\" Stripped of \"us versus them\" context, Maher is correct. No courage is required to launch a missile. We do not praise Wernher von Braun's courage for raining V-2's on London. The whole purpose of Maher's show was to get us beyond the politically correct words to see the reality of the human condition. In this case he simply overstepped by skeweringtwo cows that American conformist bias holds absolutely sacred: the evil of the 9/11 perpe- trators and the bravery of all American troops, no matter what they might be doing. Thanks to Ilkka Pyysi\u00e4inen we can see clearly the cultural mechanisms at work. Robert D.

Luckily Mr. Dahl takes a picture of the spacecraft, but after an unpleasant and threatening encounter with some \"men in black,\" Mr. Dahl reports that the photo- graph is useless because it shows too little \"doughnut\" and too much \"hole.\" Mr. Dahl's son recovered nicely from his arm injuries. A couple of days later, Kenneth Arnold claims to have observed sev- eral unexplained aircraft around Yakima, Wash ington, which \"flopping like fish,\" \"crescent-shaped,\" and on and on to an impatient reporter who eventually condenses it to the now- famous \"flying saucer\" so he can squeeze the rambling story into his daily column.
