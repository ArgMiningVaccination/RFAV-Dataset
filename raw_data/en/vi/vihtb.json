IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT YOUR EPO MEDICAL PLAN YOUR EPO MEDIC AL PLAN CONTAINS A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROGRAM , AS DESCRIBED ON PAG ES 19- 20. Failure to follow the Prior Authorization Program may result in a reduct ion or denial of benefits, which may mean a greater expense to you. TO ARRANGE FOR A PRIOR AUTHORIZ ATION, PLEASE CONTACT AN THE M BLUE CROSS AT (800) 274-7767. USC's Ex clusive Provider Organization Program USC EPO Network Providers are comprised of K eck Med icine of USC Physicians , Hills Hospit al and other selected strategic provid ers. Except for Emergency Services and Urgent Care Services, t he Plan provides no coverage for services from providers who are not EPO Network Providers. Those providers a re referred to as Non -Network Providers. If you seek treatment at a Network facility (e.g., hospital or outpatient surgery center) and a Non- Network Provider (e.g., a Non -Network Physician, anesthesiologist, radiologist, respiratory therapist) participates in your treatment, the Non-Network provider's claim will be paid at 90% of billed charges. USC , as the EPO Plan Sponsor and Plan Administrator , is not responsible for the quality and extent of care you may receive at any of the Network Hospitals or from any specific Network Provi der. It is important t hat you request information on propose d medic al treatment directly from the Hospital and your Physician. Designating a Primary Care P hysician (PCP) While you are not required to designate a Primary C are Physician (PCP) , your Network non-specialty Physician office visit copayments will be reduc ed after you do designate one , from $20 to $10 per physician office visit. You must have design ated a PCP before your visit in order for the $10 reduction in your office visit copay to apply. To designate a Primary Car e Physician for you and each of your c overed dependents, register at hconline.healthcomp.com /usc. Your PCP designation must also rem ain in effect in order for all future PCP office visits to receive the $10 r eduction. You may change your P CP designation at any time. Changes made on or before t he 15th day of the month will be effective on the first day of the following month. For service s received from Non -Network Providers, you are responsible for all charge s, except for Emergency Services and Urgent Care Services. The Deductible The Plan has a Calen dar Year deductible that will apply to Eligible Expenses which do not have a flat dolla r copay. You must meet your annual deductible before the Plan will pay Bene fits. The deductible is wai ved f or Medically Necess ary screening and testing of COVID -19 (coronavirus) and preventive services . The Calendar Year deductible does appl y (count toward) to your annual medical out -of-pocket limit. Individual The individual Cal endar Year deductible is th e first $100 of Eligib le Expenses. - 6 - PROVISIONS APPLYING T O THE E PO PLAN \u2014 Continued Family Each individual deductible incurred (met) is applied to the f amily deductible. The family deductible does not have to be met before Pla n Benefits are paid for a si ngle Covered Person i n a family. The family Calendar Year deductib le is met collectively when three or more Covered Persons in a family have Eligible Exp enses where the deductible applies (not counting more than the individual d eductible for any one person ). Once your family ded uctible is met, the Plan will pay Be nefits for all members in the family, regardless of whether each member has met their individu al deductible . Annual Deductible Individual $100 Family (3 more perso ns) $300 Carryover of Expe nses Year-to -Year There is no carryover of expense from one year t o another. Limits on Benefits start anew each January 1 . Out-Of-Pocket Limits The USC T rojan Care EPO Plan limits your expenses each year. Once a Covered Person h as met the out- of-pocket maximum(s) in one Calend ar Year, the percentage covered by the Plan increases for that year . The annual medical out-of-pocket maximum is $1,000 per person or a maximum of three individuals within a family ($1,000 x 3 people). The o ut-of-pocket prescription Copay/ Coinsurance maxim ums for the Plan are $ 2,000 maximum for an in dividual and $4,000 maximum for a Family (2 or more persons). This is a separate out -of-pocket maximum from the Plan's medical out- of-pocket maximum in a Calendar Year. This means that after a single person meet s the prescription out - of-pocket maxim um of $2, 000 in a Calendar Year, he/she will be covered at 100% for covered prescriptions fill ed at Network pharmacies for the remainder of the Calendar Year. For an emp loyee covering one or more d ependents, when the C overed Persons cumulatively reach the $4,000 prescription out -of-pocket maximum, all covered members of the family will be covered a t 100% for cove red prescriptions filled at N etwork pharmacies for the remai nder of the Calendar Year. This does not imply co verage in excess of limits expressed elsewher e.

Look-Back P eriod Eli gibility In addition to eli gibility un der the above, USC (\"the Universit y\") will a lso de termine the benefits eligibility of certain employees b y looking back at a defined period of twelve consecutive calendar mon ths (the Look- Back Period ), to determine whe ther during that measuremen t period th e employee averaged at least 30 hours of ser vice p er week. If the employee were determined to be a full -time emplo yee (as defined by the Affordable Care Act or \"ACA \") during the Look-Back measurement period, t hen the e mployee would be treated as a full -time employee during a subsequent \"stability pe riod\", regardless of the employee's number of hours of servic e during the stability period, so long as he or she remained an employ ee of the University. Fo r an employee deter mined to be a full -time emp loyee durin g the measurement period, the stab ility peri od wou ld be a period of twelve consecutive calendar months that follow s the measurement period and any relat ed Administrative Period.

What to Expect Each time a bi ll is su bmitted to Healt hComp by ei ther the patient o r the provider of services, an e xplanation of benefits (EOB) is sent to the ins ured. If paym ent is assigned to t he provider of service, then an EOB is sent to the - 55 - HOW TO U SE THE EPO PLAN \u2014 Continue d provider as wel l. Please wait for th e EO B before you pay t he provider. You and the Plan are e ntitled to special discounts whic h will be indicated on the EOB . The EOB describes how Healt hComp adjudicated the claim. It indicates the names of the insu red, pati ent, and provi der as well as the de tails of the charge an d the payment cal culation. It will list the billed amount, allowed amount (contract ed rate) , Copay amount, % Benefit (percentag e paid by the Plan), Plan payme nt and patient responsibility (C opayment and Coinsuranc e combined). The EOB will indicat e to whom payment was made. If the bill indic ates that the patient has assigned Benefit s, then the check wil l be issu ed to the provider. Someti mes you will receive two o r mo re bills for the same transaction fr om different pr oviders. This is par ticularly true for lab and x-ray services. For outpa tient lab and X -ray charges, you will often be charged both a facili ty charge (a bill from the Ho spital , imaging ce nter or lab w here the test/X -ray was performe d) and a bill from the P hysician who read the X -ray or i nterpreted the lab results. When you have sur gery, there will often be a bill from the facility, the surgeon, the assistant surgeon (if one was present) an d the anesthes iologist. You can expect to rec eive EOBs for each one o f the bills. If you have any que stions aft er you receive yo ur EOB or if you do not receive the EOB in a timely fashion, you may call the customer ser vice representative at Hea lthComp at ( 855) SC Coordination Of Benef its The Plan contai ns the pr ovisions for coord inating wit h other similar health plans when Covered Persons are covered by more th an one plan. This al lows c ombining cov erage to bene fit the Covered Person, but not to permit reimbur sements to be made which would exceed t he actu al Eligible Expenses incurr ed. For ins tance, if you are covered under t wo plans because your spouse l ists you as a dependent under a gro up plan wher e he/she is e mploye d, this will apply. If bot h, husband and wi fe are covered under the US C Plan as em ployees , each may be consid ered an eligible d ependent of the other except that both may not enroll in the US C Trojan Care EPO Plan and be cover ed as employee s and dependents at the same time. When a claim is made, the primary plan pays its bene fits without regard to any o ther plan. A secon dary plan a djusts its benefits to pay the ba lance of the remaining Eligibl e Expenses , if any, up to its maxim um responsib ility as set forth in this booklet . No plan pays more than it would with out the coordinat ion provision. Exam ple: Prim ary Plan (other th an the USC Trojan Care EPO Plan ) has a maxim um allowable charge of $1,000 with 20% coinsurance for the servic e in questio n, so the Pri mary Plan pays $800 for that ser vice, lea ving the Covered Person with a liab ility of $200. The USC Troja n Care EPO Plan is the second ary plan for that service and the maximum allowable rate for that se rvice under the USC Trojan Car e EPO Plan is also $1,000. Therefore, for this service th e USC Trojan Care EPO Plan will reimburse th e Covered P erson in th e amou nt of $200. All ap plicable Co payme nts and Coinsurance will rem ain the Covered Person's r esponsibi lity. When the Benef it payable under the primary pl an is reduced or denied as a result of the Covered Pe rson's failure to comply wi th the provi sions o f the pri mary plan ( e.g. pr ior authori zation, second surgical opinion, etc.) the USC Trojan Care EPO Plan will not consider such non- payments or pen alties to be Eligible Expenses and will not cover such penalti es or non -payments by the p rimary plan. Exampl e: Primar y plan requires pr ior authori zation for Medically Necessary ou tpatient surgery. Patient fails to obtain prior authori zation. Pr imary plan would have paid 80% of a contracted rate of $1,000 or $800 with prior authorization. Witho ut it, prima ry plan pa ys onl y 50% of th e contr acted rate or $5 00. The 30% or $300 difference is a penalty assessed b y the pri mary plan for failure to compl y with its requiremen ts. Provider is also a participating provider under t he USC Trojan Care EPO Plan with the sa me cont ract rate . USC Troja n Care EPO Plan will subtract any penalty from the rem aining balance after pr imary pla n payment, and pay u p to its c ontractual amount. $1,000 Cont ract rate of primary plan a nd US C EPO - $500 O nly 50% of contract rate (pe nalty authorizat ion) $300 Penalty assessed by primar y plan (paid by the patient) $200 maximum that USC EPO pays as secondary p lan Any hea lth plan t hat does not contain a Coo rdina tion of Bene fits provision will be cons idered prima ry. Whe n another plan cover ing you and/or you r dependents contains a coordinat ion of Benefits provision, the orde r of payments will be as follo ws: 1. the plan cover ing the patient directly as an emplo yee, rather than a s an employee's dependent, is primary and the other pl an is secon dary; 2. if a child is covered under both parents' plans and the parents are not separ ated or divorced, th e plan of the parent whose birt hday falls earlier in the year is pr imary ; but if bot h parents have the same bir thday, the p lan tha t covered the parent longer is primary ; 3. if a child is covered under bot h parents' plans and th e parents are separated or di vorced, their plans pa y in the following orde r: a. if a court decre e has established financial responsibility f or the child's heal th care expenses, th e plan of the parent with this responsibility; b. the plan of the parent with custody of the child; - 57 - GENERA L INFORMAT ION \u2014 Cont inued c. the plan of the stepparent married to the p arent with c ustody of the child; d. the plan of the parent not havi ng custody of the child; e. if there is joint custody and no c ourt decree establishing f inancial responsibility, the birt hday r ule is use d. 4. the p lan covering the patient as an activ e emp loyee or as t hat employee's dependent i s primary an d the plan which covers the patien t as a laid off or retired employee or as th at employee's dependent is secondar y; 5. if (1), (2), ( 3) or (4) do not apply , the pla n cov ering the patient longest is pr imary . The Benefi t of a plan which covers a pers on as an employee (or a dependent o f an em ployee) wil l be determined before those of a plan which covers that pe rson as a former employee (or a depende nt of such person). Furthermo re, to the extent a person is le gally permit ted under COBRA to maintain coverage un der thi s EPO Plan and anoth er group health pl an, the Benefits of that other gr oup health plan will be de termined before those of this EPO Plan. Special C oord ination of Benefits Rule for Non -Group Insurance and Travel Health Insurance Where a Co vered Person is cov ered unde r any form of non- group healt h insurance or travel health insu rance group) , ination of benefits rule applie s: This Plan is always secondary to any f orm of non- group health insurance and/o r travel hea lth ins urance (g roup or non- group) . ACA Bench marking To the extent any provisi on of the Plan conflicts w ith the A CA or other applicab le law, as determine d by USC, t he Plan shall be automatically amend ed to so comply. A ny dollar limitations unde r the Plan o n essen tial heal th benefits under the ACA sha ll be benchmarked for ACA purpose s against a benchmark plan of any s tate permitting thos e limitations as sel ected by US C, in its sole discretion, but nothi ng he rein shall b e interpreted as requiring the Plan to provide essential health be nefits or any B enefits other than as expressly stat ed in the Plan. USC in it s sole di scretion, may modify such bench marking fr om time to time in any ma nner it sees fit. Modifi cation Of Bene fits Under certain conditions, Benefits paya ble under the Plan may be mod ified by the Pla n Administrator to provide alternative treatment for a Covere d Person' s catastroph ic (or which, in the Plan Admini strator 's judgment, could become catast rophic) sickne ss or injury. Benefit modification will be d etermined exclusively by the Plan Administrator in its discretion. The Plan Admi nistrato r shall h ave the r ight to r eview the pa tient's medical needs and determ ine whi ch services, supplies and provid ers are available under the modification of Benefits, taki ng into consideration such fa ctors as the Plan Administrator deems appropria te, includin g, but not limited to, the cost - effecti vene ss of any Benefit modification. The Plan Administrator shall determine the Benefi t coverage under which the alternative treat ment shall be considered paya ble and the dura tion of the Benefit modificatio n. A lternative treatm ent does not inclu de services and supplies which th e Plan Admi nistrat or determines to be experimental or investigat ional or otherwise inappropriate. Subrogatio n The following provision sha ll apply to all Benefits provided under any section of this Plan: A Covered P erson may incur medic al or other charges r elated to i njuries or illness caused by the act or omission of another person; or Another Party may be liabl e or legally responsible for payment of charges incurred in connection with the injuries or illne ss. If so , the Cov ered Person may have a claim agai nst that ot her per son or a nother Party for payment of the medica l or other charges. In that event, the Plan will be secondary, not primar y, and the Plan will be Subrogated to all right s the Covere d Person may have against t hat other pe rson or Another Party and will b e entit led to Reimbursement. In addition, the Plan sh all have the first lien against any Recovery to the extent of Benefits pa id or to be paid and expenses incurred by the Plan in enfor cing this provisio n. The Plan's first l ien supersedes any ri ght that th e Cover ed Person may have to be \"made w hole\". In othe r words, the Plan is entitled to the right o f first Reimbursement out of any Recovery t he Covered P erson procures or may be en titled to procu re regard less of - 58 - GENERA L INFORMAT ION \u2014 Cont inued whether the C overed Person has rec eived compe nsation for any of h is damages or expen ses, including any of his attorn eys' fees or costs. Ad ditionall y, the Plan's right of first Reimburse ment will no t be reduced for any reason , including att orneys' fees, costs, comparati ve neg ligence, limits of collect ability or responsibi lity, or otherwise . As a condition to recei ving Be nefits under the Plan, the Cove red Pe rson agrees that acceptance of B enefits is c onstructive notice of this provision. The Cov ered P erson must: 1. Execute and d eliver a Subrogat ion and Rei mburseme nt Agreement ; 2. Authorize the Plan to sue, compromise and settle in th e Covered Person' s name to the e xtent of the amount of medical o r other Benefits paid for the injuries or illness un der the Plan and the expenses in curred by the Plan in collecting this a mount, and as sign to the Plan th e Covered Person's rights to Re covery when this provis ion applies; 3. Within 10 busi ness days, reimburse the Plan, out of any Rec overy made from A nother Party, 100% o f the amoun t of medica l or othe r Benefits paid for the injuries or illness under the Plan and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs of suit , regardless of an action's outcome) incurred by the Plan in collecti ng this amount (without reduct ion for attorneys' fe es, costs, comparat ive negligence, limits of colle ctability or responsibilit y, or otherwise); 4.

H owever, failure or refus al on the Covered Per son's part to execute such agree ments or furnish information does not p reclude the Plan from exercising its right to Subrogation or ob tainin g full reimbursem ent. In additio n, the Cover ed Person will do nothing t o prejudice the Plan's r ight to Subrogation a nd R eimbur sement and acknowledge s that the Plan precludes operation of the made -whol e and common- fund doct rines. The Plan Admini strator has maximum discretio n to interpret th e terms of this provision and to make changes, as it deems ne cessary. Any amounts recovered will be sub ject to Sub rogation or Reimbursement. In no case w ill the amoun t subject to Subrogati on or Reimbursement exce ed the amo unt of medical or other Benefits paid for th e injuries or illness under the Plan and t he expens es incurred by the Plan in coll ecting this amount. The Plan h as a right to recover in full, out of any Re covery withou t redu negligen ce, limits of c ollectability or responsibility, or otherwise, even if the Cove red Person does not r eceive full compensat ion for all of his c harges and expenses. \"Covered Person\" means anyone cove red under the Plan, including mi nor D ependent s. \"Another Part y\" shall mean a ny individua l or organization, o ther th an the Plan, who i s liable or legally respons ible (or w ho is alleg ed or claim ed to be liable or legally responsible) to pay expens es, compens ation or d amages in connection w ith a Covere d Person's injuri es or illness. \"Another Par ty\" shall include th e party or parties who caused t he injuries or illnes s (or are alleged or c laimed to have caused the injuries or illness) ; the insurer, g uarantor or other i ndemnifier of the party o r parties wh o caused the injuries or illness ; a Covered Person's own insurer , such as uninsured, unde rinsur ed, medical payments, no-fault, homeowner' s, renter's or any wo rkers' compensa tion insur er; and any other individual or GENERA L INFORMAT ION \u2014 Cont inued organiza tion that is lia ble or legally responsib le (or is alleged or c laimed to be liable or legally responsi ble) for payment in c onne ction with the in juries or i llness. \"Recover y\" shall mean the speci fic fund of any and all monies paid to the Covered Person by wa y of judgment, s ettlement or otherwi se (no matter how those monies may be characterized, des ignated o r allocated) to compe nsate for any losses caused by, or in co nnection w ith, the inj uries o r illness. Any Recovery shall be deemed to apply, firs t, for Reim burs ement. \"Reimbursement\" shall mea n repayment from the Re covery to the Plan for medical or other Benefits th at it has p aid towa rd care and treatment of the injury or illn ess and for the expenses incurred by the Plan in colle cting this B enefit amount. \"Subrogati on\" shall mean the P lan's rig ht to pursue the Covere d Person' s claims for medical or other c harges paid by the Pla n agains t Another Party. If the Cove red Person retai ns an att orney, that attorney must sign the S ubrog ation and Reimb ursemen t Agreement as a condition to any paym ent of Be nefits and as a conditi on to any payment of future Be nefits for other illn esses or injuries. Additionally, the Cove red Pe rson's attorney must reco gnize and consent to the fact that t he Plan precludes the opera tion of the \"made -whole\" and und\" doct rines, and the must agr ee not to assert eith er doctrin e in his pu rsuit of Re covery. The Plan will neither pay the C overed Perso n's attorn eys' fees and costs associated with the recovery of funds, nor reduce its reimbur sement pro rata for t he payme nt of the Covered Perso n's attorneys' fees and costs. Attorneys ' fees will be payable from th e Recovery only after the Plan has received full Reim bursement. A Covered Person or his a ttorn ey who receives any Re covery (whether by judgment, settlemen t, compro mise, or otherwise) has an absol ute obligation to imm ediately t ender the R ecovery to the Plan under the terms of t his provis ion. Further more, a Co vered Person agrees to direct his or her att orney who re ceives any Recovery (whet her by judgment, set tlement, compromise, or otherwis e) that h e or she has an absol ute obliga tion to imm ediately te nder the Recovery to the Plan under the terms of th is provisi on. A Covered Person or his attorney who receives any such Reco very and does not im mediately tender t he Recove ry to the Plan will be deemed to hold the Recovery in construct ive trust f or the Plan, becaus e the Covered Person or his attorney is not the right ful owner of the Recovery and should not be in possessio n of th e Recovery until t he Plan has been ful ly reimbu rsed out of the Recover y. These provisions apply to t he parents , trustee, guardian or other r epresentative of a mi nor Cov ered Person and to the heir or personal representative of the estate of a deceased Cover ed Person, regardl ess of applicable law and whe ther or not the minor's represen tative has access or control of the Recover y. When a Covered Person does not compl y with the provisions of this se ction, the Plan Administrator shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, t o deny payment of an y claims for Benefits by the Cov ered Pers on and to deny or reduce future Benefits p ayable (inc luding pa yment of future Bene fits fo r other injurie s or illne sses) under the Plan by the amount due as Re imbursement to the Plan. The Plan Adm inistrator may also, in its s ole discretion, deny or reduce future Benefits (inclu ding futur e Benefits for other i njuries or illnesses) under a ny othe r group benefit s plan maintained by the Plan Sponsor. The reductio ns will equal t he amou nt of the required Reimbursement. If t he Plan must bring an action aga inst a Co vered Person to enfor ce this pr ovision, th en that Covered Per son agrees to pay the Plan's attorneys' fee s and cost s, regardless of the action's outcom e. In certa in circum stances , a Covered Person may receive a Recov ery that includes amounts intend ed to be compensation for past and futur e expenses for treatme nt of the illness or injury, which i s the cause of the Recove ry. This Plan will not cover any expenses for which comp ensatio n was provided thr ough a previous Recov ery. Thi s exclusion will apply to the full extent of such Rec overy or t he amount of the expen ses subm itted to the Plan for payment, whichever is less. The Plan also precludes operation of the mad e-whole and com mon-fund doctrines in apply ing this provision. It is the responsibility of th e Covered Person to inform the Plan Admi nistrator w hen expe nses are incurred related to an illness or injury for which a Recovery has been made. T he Covered Pe rson is req uired to submit full and complete documentation of any such Recovery in order for the Plan to c onsider eligible expe nses that exceed the R ecovery. - 60 - GENERAL INFORMATION \u2014 Continued Medicare Program Beneficiaries who are c overed under Medicare will be subject to coor dination of Benefi ts with the USC Trojan Care EPO Plan assuming primary payor status to the extent required by applicab le law. Medicare assu ming secon dary payor status may pay the balance of the remai ning Eligib le Expenses, if an y, less payment s fro m the P lan. All applicabl e Copa yments and Coinsuranc e will remain the Covered Person' s responsibility. To the extent Medicare is the primary payor unde r appl icable law, the Plan will be the secondar y payor. For example , to the extent permitted by law the USC Trojan Care EPO Plan (the Pla n) will be secondar y to Medica re for a Covered Perso n who has been eligible for Me dicare for 30 months due to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) or for a dis abled employe e who is not active ly wo rking a nd is eligible for Medica re due to that di sability. In such cases, the USC Tro jan Care EP O Plan will pay on a s econdary basis to Medicare, ev en if the Medicare- eligible Cove red Person has not enrolled in Medicare. Therefore, t o prevent a gap in cove rage, i t is very impor tant for a Medicare- eligible C overed Person, for whom the Plan can legally be a secondary payor to Medica re, to be covered by Medi care as soon as he or she is eligible or, if later, by the first da y of the nint h month of any avai lable Medicare Part B Speci al Enrollm ent Period immediatel y following t he Covered Person's terminatio n of employment at USC . For any Covered Person enrol led in Medicare Part A , but not in Medic are Part B, and who is also enr olled for con tinuation coverage under COBRA for this Plan, the Plan w ill not estimate any Medicare Part B Benefits during the first e ight months of COBRA a nd will instead pay as the pri mary payor . Contact M edicare for more information about Par t B Special Enrollment Pe riods. Termination Of Coverage The coverage fo r yourself and your covered dependents will terminate if you ce ase to be an eligible employee or if the Plan is discontinued or if you o r your cove red depende nt commit s any fraudulent or illegal ac t in connecti on with participati on in the Plan. The coverage fo r whic h contributions a re required, if a ny, will terminate if you stop making contributions. A depend ent's coverage will t erminate w hen he/she is no longe r an eligible dependent. However, if yo u or any of your covered depende nts cease to be eligible, y ou m ust in itiate your delet ion request throu gh the Workday Empl oyee Self S ervice system in order to remove that person from yo ur coverag e. In the e vent of termination of employment, you r coverage w ill terminate the last day of th e mon th in w hich you termin ate. In th e event of termin ation for cause ( fraud or illegal ac tivity), su bject to the ACA, term ination w ill be retroactive to the date participati on in the Plan comm enced and the Plan will be enti tled to full refund of all claim s paid on be half all Covere d Persons. - 61 - Q & A 1.

In these cases, you shouldn't be charged more than your plan's copayments, coinsurance and/or deductible. What is \"balance billing\" (sometimes called \"surprise billing\")? When you see a doctor or ot her health care provi der, you ma y owe certain out -of-pocket costs, like a copayment, coinsurance, o r deductible. You may have additional costs or have to pay the entire bill if you see a provider or visit a health car e facil ity that isn't in your hea lth pla n's network. \"Out -of-netw ork\" means providers and facilities that haven't sig ned a contract with your health plan to provide services. Out -of-network providers may be allowed to bill you for the d ifference between what your plan pay s and the full amount cha rged for a service. This is called \" balance billing \". This amount is likely more than in -network costs for the same service and m ay not count toward your plan 's deduc tible or annual out -of-pocket limit. \"Surprise billing\" is an unexpected bala nce bill. Thi s can happen when you don't have control over who is involved in your care \u2014like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an in -network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out -of-network provi der. Surprise medical bills could cost thousands of dollars depending on the procedure or service. You are protected fro m balance billing for: Emergency services If you have an emergency medical condition a nd receive emergency services from an ou t-of-network provider or facility, the most the y can bill you is your plan's in- network cost -sharing amoun tibles). An out cannot balance bill you for these emerg ency services. This includes services you may get after you're in stable condit ion, unless you give written c onsent and give up your pr otections not to be balanced bil led for these post -stabilization services. Certa in services at an in -network hospital or ambulatory surgica l center When you receive services from an in -network hospita l or ambulatory surgical c enter, certain providers t here may be out-of-network. In t hese cases, the most those providers can bill yo u is your plan's in- network cost -sharing amount. This applies t o emergency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, labor atory, neonatology, assist ant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist services. These p roviders cannot balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your protections not to be balance billed. If you recei ve other types of services at these in -network facili ties, out -of- network provide rs cannot balance bill yo u, unless you give written conse nt and give up your protections. You are never required to give up your protections from balance billing. You are also not required to get out-of- network care . You can cho ose a provider or fa cility in your plan's netw ork. When balance billing is not allowed, you also have the following protect ions: You are only responsible for paying your share of the cost ( such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductible that you would pay if the provider or facility was in -network). Your health plan will pay any additional costs to out- of-network provider s and facili ties directly. Your health plan generally must: Cover emergency services without requiring you to get appr oval for services in advance ( also know n as \"prior authorization\" ). Cover emergency services by out -of-network providers . Base what you owe the provider or facility (cost -shari ng) on what it would pay an in- network provider or facility and show that amount in your explanation of benefits . Count any amount you pay for emergency services and certain out-of-network provider service s perfo rmed at an in- network hospital or ambula tory surgical center toward any in-network deductible and out of pocket .

Visit www.cms.gov/nosurprises for more information about your rights under f ederal law. - 65 - NO SURPRISE S ACT NOTIC E - Continued Benefits of Using In -Network Providers and Facilities The above protections ar e very important. There are still some benefits of using in-network providers and facilities whenever reasonably possible and medically a ppropria te. For example, if you intend on voluntarily seeing a network provider after stabilization of your emergency f or that condition, in some cases it may be a sm oother transition if the emergency care was also provided by an in-network provider or fa cility. F urthermore, for a pr ovider or facility to be treated as in -network, the provider or facilit y is subject to cred entialing and oversight by Anthem, the Anthem Provider Network Administrator.
