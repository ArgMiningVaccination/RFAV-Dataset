It is often associated with bloating or abdominal distention. These key symptoms can vary in severity and tend to remit and recur, often affected by dietary exposures and stress . IBS is a manifestation of bidirectional disordered communication within the brain-gut axis that influences gastrointestinal and altered gastrointest inal (GI) motility, post - infectious diarrhea, chronic stress, altered brain networks, and the microbiome. Alterations in the colonic immune system, neuronal activity, and gut permeability also play a role. It is one of the most common GI disorders affecting approxi mately 10% of the general population and can have significant impact on a patient 's quality of life .2,3 Historically, many providers believe it is a diagnosis of exclusion , but this notion is changing and moving towards a positive, symptom -based diagnosis. o The current recommended diagnosti c criteria for IBS are the Rome IV criteria: Recurrent abdominal pain ( 1 day /week for 3 months) associated with two or more of the following: related to defecation, a ssociated with a change in the frequency of stool, associated with a change in the form (appearance) of stool . o Typical associated lower GI symptoms include bloating and flatulence . Upper GI symptoms include nausea, burping, early satiety, and dyspeps ia. o Relief of abdominal discomfort after a bowel movement or in association with a change in stool form or frequency is a defining feature. Bowel dysfunction includes frequent bowel movements, fecal urgency, altered stool form (hard/lumpy or loose/ watery) , sense of or incomplete evacuation, straining with stool passage, and passage of mucous. o IBS corre lates with other pain syndromes, so other symptoms dysuria, frequent/urgent urination, widespread musculoskeletal pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and headaches may also be present . Pain often is variable and may be related to the subtype. 4 IBS is subtyped according to stool consistency: o Constipation-predominant (IBS -C, > 25% hard stools and < 25% loose stools) o Diarrhea- predominant (IBS -D, > 25% loose stools and < 25% hard stools) o Mixed bowel habits (IBS -M, > 25% loose stools and > 25% hard stools) o Unclassified (IBS -U, < 25% loose stools and < 25% hard stools) 1 Farmer, A.

Last Updated: June 2023 Page 3 of 14 Back to Algorithm The most common diseases mislabeled as IBS are celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and microscopic colitis. GI cancers are unl ikely in patients that meet usual crite ria for IBS in the absence of red flags/abnormal blood work. Checklist to guide in -clinic review of your patient with IBS Recurrent abdominal pain at least one day per week (on average) in the last three months, with two or more of the following: Related to defecation (either increasing or improving pain) Associated with a change in frequency of stool Associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool Complete d etailed medical history , physical examination, and review of medications . Complete baseline investigations confirming no abnormal results (CBC, ferritin, serological testing to exclude celiac disease). Confirm absence of alarm features (see algorithm Box 3). If alarm features are identified, refer for specialist consultation. In diarrhea predominant patients - review history of cholecystectomy and consider ordering fecal calprotectin if there is a high clinical suspicion of irritable bowel disease ( IBD). EXPANDED DETAILS 1. Suspected IBS Recurrent abdominal pain at least one day per week (on average) in the last three months, with two or more of the following: o Related to defecation (either increasing or improving pain) o Associated with a change in frequency of stool. o Associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool. Are symptoms consistent with IBS? Some important questions to guide the history. o Do you experience pain? o Does the pain improve/worsen/stay the same with bowel movements? o When the pain is present, is it often associated with a change in stool frequency or stool form? o Do these symptoms represent an acute change? o Typical associated lower GI symptoms include bloating and flatulence. Upper GI symptoms include nausea, burping, early satiety, and dyspepsia. o IBS correlates with other pain syndromes, so other symptoms such as dysuria, frequent/urgent urination, widespread musculoskeletal pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and headaches may also be present. Pain often is v ariable and may be related to the subtype. It is vital to understand a patient's predominant symptom (pain, constipation, or diarrhea) as this influence's treatment selection. 2. Baseline investigations A detailed medical history and physical examination should be performed at presentation to assess other conditions that mimic IBS. This should include a careful review of medications to identify those potentially causing GI side effects ( e.g., and herbal products). In patients with diarrhea-predominant symptoms, ask about a history of cholecystectomy and whether this coincided with onset or worsening of symptoms. Post -cholecystectomy diarrhea, due to bile acid diarrhea (BAD), can be treated with cholestyramine. IBS requires few standard initial laboratory investigations . o CBC and ferritin should be tested. Last Updated: June 2023 Page 4 of 14 Back to Algorithm o Serological testing is suggested to exclude celiac disease, but routine testing for inflammation using C -reactive protein (CRP) or food allergies is not generally recommended. o Anemia or other alarm features (see Section 3) increase the likelihood of organic disease. If present , the patient will require further investigation. o Patients often ask about small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) as a cause of symptoms. Although there may be a link between SIBO and IBS, the quality of the existing evidence is low. The accuracy of the breath test for SIBO is highly variable and may be unreliable. Routine testing for SIBO is not currently recommended. 1,5 Additional testing can be considered based on patient history. o C.difficile or ova and parasites if there has been recent travel and diarrhea is the main concern. A significant percentage of patients with chronic abdominal pain or other functional GI disorders have a history of trauma (e.g., sexual assault or physical and psych ological abuse) or PTSD. This typ e of trauma may contribute to symptoms through the brain- gut axis, so it is important to explore this in a compassionate manner. Undergoing endoscopy may trigger a negative response in survivors of trauma. A ddressing this possibility may be appropriate if considering a referral for endoscopy when the clinician is aware of a history of trauma. For additional information, see Abuse, Trauma, and GI Illne ss: Is There a Link? and Trauma- informed care . 3. Alarm features If any of the following alarm features are identified, refer for consultation/endoscopy. Include any and all identified alarm features in the referral to ensure proper triage. Family history (first degree relative) of IBD or colorectal cancer Onset of symptoms after age 50 Unintended weight loss (> 5% over 6-12 months) Visible blood in stool (see High Risk Rectal Bleeding Pathway and/or Iron Deficiency Anemia Pathway ) Nocturnal symptoms Iron deficiency anemia (see Iron Primer ) 4.

The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology , 5(2), 117- 131. Treatment options - all IBS subtypes Patients with IBS will benefit from a multipronged, individualized approach to treatment, including dietary modifications, psychological, and pharmacological therapies.1,6 Dietary modifications All subtypes of patients with IBS are likely to benefit from dietary modifications . Assess common food triggers: Follow a systematic approach to effectively guide modifications and understand the impact changes make on symptoms. Diets high in processed foods, fatty foods, caffeine, sugar alcohols, alcohol, and insoluble fibre (e.g., wheat bran, raw vegetables, the skin of fruits, and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and legumes) can increase IBS symptoms. It may be helpful for patients to use the Food and Lifestyle Symptom Diary to understand their symptoms, food triggers, and stressors. Use the diary to determine how dietary modifications and psychological and pharmacological therapies impact their symptoms. Assess dietary intake compared to Canada's Food Guide . Referral to a Registered Dietitian can be helpful to support dietary changes. Last Updated: June 2023 Page 5 of 14 Back to Algorithm 7 Dyna Med Plus. (2018, September 10). Confidence in Practice. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . https://www -dy named- com.ahs.idm.oclc.org/results?q=ibs&lang=en Dietary modifications cont'd Total fibre: Adults are recommended to consume 14 g/ 1000 kcal of fibre per day. Suggest about 21-38 g/day for most adults. Two Types of fibre: oInsoluble fibre is found in wheat bran, the skin of fruits , and many raw vegetables. I t adds bulk to the stool and contributes greatly to daily total fibre requirements . It may not add therapeutic health benefits like soluble fibre. oSoluble fibre is found in psyllium, oats, barley, fruit, and seeds. It absorbs water in the intestine to form a viscous gel that thickens the stool and stimulates peristalsis. Soluble Fibre Supplementation: symptom relief for patients with IBD, IBS, constipation, and diarrhea. The therapeutic goal is 5-10 g/day of soluble fibre from foods and supplements including: 1 tbsp. psyllium husk or powder supplement - 3.0 grams 2 tbsp. ground flaxseed - 1.8 grams \u00bd cup kidney beans - 2.8 grams 1 pear - 2.2 grams General Care: oIncreasing fibre intake may result in negative side- effects that can be minimized or avoided. Slowly increase fibre to prevent gas, abdominal pain, and bloating. Start with a thirdof a dose and determine tolerance. Drink additional fluid (water) to compliment a high fibre diet. Inadequate fluid maylead to constipation, hardening of stool, bloating, and abdominal pain. Caution soluble fibre intake for people with, or at risk of , a bowel obstruction or narrowing of the esophagus, stomach, or intestine. Fibre supplements may reduce or delay absorption of certain medications. oSee P atient Resources s ection for more information on fibre supplementation. Ensure adequate fluids: 2 L/day for females, 3 L/day for males. Physical activity 20+ minutes of physical activity/day, aiming for 150 min/week is known to be an effective strategy for stress reduction. See the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines . Psychological therapy Patient counselling and reassurance. A key to effective long-term management of IBS is to provide patients reassurance after their initial diagnosis and offer points of reassessment and reappraisal to establish a therapeutic relationship. oReassurance about potential inconsistency in the pattern of symptoms in response to triggers may be necessary. Not all elimination/avoidance of food triggers consistently orpredictably improves symptoms. The contribution from food is complex and symptoms are often the result of multiple contributing factors (e.g., \"I tried cheese last week and felt fine. Today , I have terrible bloating and diarrhea!\") . Cognitive -Behavioral T herapy and hypnotherapy may help with stress management and gastrointestinal symptoms . 7 It is r ecommended that therapy be provided by a regulated health professional such as a registered psychologist. Screening for , and treating , any underlying sleep or mood disorder s may be important.Last Updated: June 2023 Page 6 of 14 Back to Algorithm Pharmacological therapy - all IBS subtypes The use of pharmaceuticals in IBS is generally reserved for those who have not adequately responded to dietary and lifestyle interventions , or in those with moderate or severe symptoms that impair quality of life. These often need to be tailored to t he patient's predominant subtype presentation ( e.g., pain v s. diarrhea v s. constipation). Antispasmodics Evidence: May reduce symptoms of abdominal pain, however, it is not clear if one agent is more effective than another.8 Place in therapy: May provide symptom relief . Consider peppermint oil as first line as it is generally well tolerated and appears to be effective. Mechanism of action: Smooth muscle relaxation by various mechanisms. Adverse effects: Anticholinergic reactions with some agents (CNS depression, xerostomia), dyspepsia (peppermint oil) .9 Dose: A reasonable trial is 1 -2 agents (not at once) given for 4 weeks as listed below . Could use regularly or PRN. Recommended Enteric c oated peppermint oil Place therapy: Shown benefit for reducing abdominal pain10,11 Adverse effects: May interact with medications. It is important to discuss use with their pharmacist and/or healthcare team.9 Recommended Medications: Enteric coated peppermint oil capsules (0.2-0.275 mL caps) - 2 capsules BID ($20 -25/month, unlikely to be covered by insurance providers) . IBgard\u00ae - 80 mg/capsule. Max dose is 6 capsules /day or 480 mg/day ($70-100/month). Take 2 capsules 30 -90 minutes before meals. 5. Specific approaches based on IBS subtypes IBS-D (diarrhea -predominant) Categorizing IBS by dominant subtype guides specific treatment approaches. Fecal calprotectin Consider ordering fecal calprotectin in IBS -D patients if there is a high clinical suspicion of IBD. Calprotectin is a protein released into the gastrointestinal tract when it is inflamed and can be detected in the stool by laboratory assay. Elevated levels of fecal calprotectin are found in inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Mid-range levels can also be found in s everal benign conditions, such as in patients on NSAIDs or PPIs or those with GI infections, celiac disease, and microscopic colitis (see Microscopic Colitis Primer ). By contrast, in functional disorders such as IBS, fecal calprotectin levels are normal.12 8 Ruepert, L., Quartero, A. O., de Wit, N. J., van der Heijden, G. J., Rubin, G., & Muris, J. W. (2011).

Treatment options All prescribed medications should be fully discussed with the patients in terms of specific risks and side effects and appropriateness of use in context of their full medical history. Loperamide (Imodium\u00ae) Evidence: Does not affect global IBS symptoms but may help with frequency and consistency of bowel movements. Suggested against for overall symptom improvement .13 Mechanism of action : Through \u00b5 (mu) opioid receptor agonis t, thus decreasing GI motility. Place in therapy: Effective antidiarrheal. Does not lead to overall symptom improvement in patients with IBS. Adverse effects: Sedation, nausea, abdominal cramps .11 Lowest addiction potential of all opioids. Dose : 4 mg initially, followed by 2 mg after each loose bowel movement. Max 16 mg/day. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) Evidence: The most studied antidepressant class for treatment of abdominal pain. 14 Mechanism of action: Suggested to be beyond serotonin and norepinephrine, and as a result of blocking voltage-gated ion channels, opioid receptor activation and potential neuro- immunologic anti-inflammatory effects .9 Their anticholinergic properties also slow GI transit time. Place in therapy: Recommended for overall symptom improvement in patients with IBS, as well as sleep issues, anxiety, or depression. Adverse effects: Anticholinergic and ary retention).13 Use with caution in patients at risk of prolonged QT . It can take 2 -3 months to reach maximum effect . The lowest effective dose should be used. Reassess therapy after 6-12 months. Dose should be gradually reduced if discontinuing. Recommended Medications Nortriptyline - 10-25 mg qhs. Increase dose by 10- 25 mg every 3- 4 weeks (due to delayed onset). May require 25-75 mg/day . Often takes 2- 3 months for peak effect. ($20-60/month). Amitriptyline - 10-25 mg qhs. Increase dose by 10- 25 mg every 3- 4 weeks (due to delayed onset). May require 25-75 mg/day . Often takes 2- 3 months for peak effect. ($15-20/month) . Desipramine - 25 mg qhs . Increase based on response and tolerability. Doses up to 150 mg daily have been evaluated for IBS (~$25/ month) . Probiotics Evidence: May improve symptoms in patients with IBS, but overall conclusions are limited by inconsistency in specific probiotics studied. Last Updated: June 2023 Page 8 of 14 Back to Algorithm Second line therapies Consider consulting a GI using Specialist Link, Connect MD, or e-Referral Advice Request for guidance on these treatments . Rifaximin (Zaxine\u00ae) A non- systemically absorbed antibiotic. Mechanism of action: N ot clearly identified, but may alter the microbiome, thus reducing gas production. Dose: 550 mg 3 x/day for 2 weeks . This is a safe medication but tends to require multiple recurrent courses. There is no long-term safety or efficacy data over 3 courses . (~$325 /month, not covered by public insurers ). IBS M/U (mixed/undefined ) Treatment options Lifestyle and dietary principles Refer to Section 4 Probiotics See IBS -D treatment recommendations Low FODMAPS diet See IBS -D treatment recommendations TCAs See IBS-D treatment recommendations IBS-C (constipation predomina nt) Treatment options Fibre and fluids See Patient Resources section Osmotic laxatives Evidence: Laxatives do not affect global IBS sy mptoms but may help with frequency and consistency of bowel movements.13 Mechanism of action : Drawing water into the colon to increase bowel movements and allow easier passage of stool. 15 Su, G. L., Ko, C. W., Bercik, P., Falck -Ytter, Y., Sultan, S., Weizman, A. V., & Morgan, R. L. (2020). AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Role of Probiotics in the Management of Gastrointestinal Disorders. Gastroenterology . Place in therapy: May improve global symptoms, bloating, and flatulence. The most effective probiotic strain is unknown. P atients should be encouraged to select products that are licensed by Health Canada's Natural and Non- prescription Health Products Database. Refer to Probiotic Chart for up to date evidence. These strains have the most evidence to support benefits (a one -month trial is reasonable). Probiotics have not been conclusively shown to im prove symptoms of IBS .15 Probiotics cont'd Recommended Strains with the Most Evidence Align\u00ae oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, polyols (FODMAP) diet is suggested, while an exclusive gluten-free diet is not. Some patients may wish to trial the elimination of a single nutrient/food ( e.g., lactose, fructans, fructose, sugar alcohols) or an elimination of multiple nutrients/foods using this diet. Referral to a dietitian should be considered if this diet is planned. A single nutrient/food elimination trial is the removal of a nutrient/food f or 2-4 weeks. Use a symptom diary to note the impact of the dietary modification. If no improvement, the nutrient/food can be added back, and a second single nutrient/food elimination trial can be tested. A low FODMAP diet trial is the removal of multiple nutrients/food all at once for 2-6 weeks (max) until symptoms have improved. A single nutrient/food is then added back into the diet, using a food diary to test for tolerance. Last Updated: June 2023 Page 9 of 14 Back to Algorithm Place in therapy: Consider use of laxatives in patients with constipation. Advise titration of dose to assure well- formed stool. Stepwise treatment with laxatives of increasing strength is recommended until constipation relief is reached. Adverse effects: Avoid use of lactulose due to common side -effects of bloating, distention, and cramps. Recommended Medications Polyethylene Glycol (PEG 3350) - Start with 17 g at night dissolved in 250 mL of liquid. Titrate to effect or max 34 g/day. Onset of action 48-9 6 hours. Safe for long- term use. ($25-50/month). Osmotic laxatives cont'd Milk of Magnesia - 30-60 mL/day. Onset of action 1 -6 hours. Avoid in renal failure due to risk of hypermagnesemia. Linaclotide (Constella\u00ae) Mechanism of increases intestinal transit . May decre ase visceral pain by reducing pain-sensing nerve activity.13 Place in therapy: For persistent IBS symptoms with patients motivated for more intensive or expensive treatments. Adverse effects: Diarrhea, upper abdominal pain. Dose : 290 mcg daily PO 30 minutes before the first meal of the day ($160/month) . Prucalopride (Resotran\u00ae) Evidence: Shown to be effective in idiopathic constipation, there is less evidence of the effect of prucalopride in IBS -C. Has not been studied for use in men.16 Mechanism of action : Through 5-HT 4 receptor agonism, leading to prokinetic activity. Adverse effects: Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache. For constipation: 2 mg PO daily. Reduce dose to 1 mg PO daily if ($120/month): o > 65 years old o CrCl < 30 mL/min o Severe hepatic impairment Discontinue therapy if no benefit provided with 4 weeks of treatment. Tenapanor (Ibsrela\u00ae) Evidence: AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on the Pharmacological Management of IBS -C suggests using Tenapanor in patient with IBS -C (condition recommendation, moderate certainty). Mechanism of action: S odium/hydrogen exchanger 3 inhibitor. A cts locally to reduce sodium absorption from the small intestine and colon. This results in increased lumen water secretion, accelerating intestinal transit time and softening stool consistency. It also decreases intestinal permeability and visceral hypersensitivity in animal models, which may reduce abdominal pain. Adverse effects: Di arrhea, abdominal distension, flatulence, rectal hemorrhage, dizziness. Dose: (adult, IBS -C) 50 mg po BID immediately prior to breakfast or the first meal of the day and immediately prior to dinner. No dosage adjustments for renal or hepatic impairment. Plecanatide (Trulance\u00ae) Evidence: AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on the Pharmacological Management of IBS -C suggests using Plecanatide in patients with IBS -C (condition recommendation, moderate certainty). Mechanism of action: Plecanatide and its active metabolite bind and agonize guanyl ate cyclase -C on the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium. Intracellular and extracellular cGMP concentrations are subsequently increased resulting in chloride and bicarbonate secretion into the intestinal lumen. Intestinal fluid increases and GI transit time is accelerated. 16 CPS [Internet]. Ottawa (ON): Last Updated: June 2023 Page 10 of 14 Back to Algorithm Adverse effects: Diarrhea, abdominal distention, abdominal tenderness, flatulence, nausea, UTI, increase liver enzymes, dizziness, URTI. Dose: (adult, IBS -C or CIC) 3 mg po daily. No dosage adjustments for renal or hepatic impairment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Evidence: Limited data to support use of SSRIs for IBS -C. Place in therapy: Can be helpful with abdominal pain and may loosen bowel movements for patients. Adverse effects: Nausea, diarrhea, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, tremor, insomnia. Caution with citalopram in patients with prolonged QT. Lowest effective dose should be used. It can take 2-3 months to reach maximum effect. Reassess therapy in 6-12 months. Dose should be gradually reduced if discontinuing. Recommended Medications Fluoxetine (Prozac\u00ae) - 10 mg daily . May doses escalate up to 60 mg daily (~$25/month). Citalopram (Celexa\u00ae) - 10-20 mg daily . May doses escalate up to 40 mg daily (~$15/month) . NOTE: Alternative Remedies Given the significant impact of IBS on quality of life, many patients pursue alternative , and often complementary , therapies to treat their symptoms ( e.g., acupuncture, yoga, and reflexology). Although there are no evidence- based guidelines to support these alternative therapies, it is important to keep communication open. 6. When to r efer for consultation and/or endoscopy If alarm features are identified If investigations reveal a positive c eliac disease screen If the fecal calprotectin result is > 120 mcg/g In patients with IBS-D who have persistent symptoms or limited benefits from treatments, a referral may be helpful to investigate for Crohn's disease and microscopic colitis. For patients with IBS-C or alternating diarrhea and constipation, colonoscopy is unlikely to yield relevant findings . If recommended strategies have l ed to un satisfactory treatment or management of symptoms. o Note : Consider using an advice service before referring Provide as much information as possible on the referral form, including identified alarm feature(s), important findings, and treatment/management strategies trialed with the patient. In the absence of alarm features for patients under age 50, colonoscopy is unlikely to be ad ditive for the diagnosis of IBS . Studies show that a colonoscopy does not provide reassurance to patients with IBS17. Still concerned about your patient? The primary care physician is typically the provider who is most familiar with their patient's overall health and k nows how they tend to present. Changes in normal patterns, or onset of new or worrisome symptoms , may raise suspicion for a potentially serious diagnosis , even when investigations are normal and typical alarm features are not present. There is evidence to support the importance of the family physician's intuition or \"gut feeling\" about patient symptoms, especially when the family physician is worried about a sinister cause such as cancer. A meta-analysis examining the predictive value of gut feelings showed that the odds of a patient being diagnosed with cancer, if a GP recorded a gut feeling, were 4.24 times higher than when no gut feeling was recorded. 18 17 Spiegel, B. M., Gralnek, I. M., Bolus, R., Chang, L., Dulai, G. S., Naliboff, B., & Mayer, E. A. (2005).

Last Updated: June 2023 Page 11 of 14 Back to Algorithm When a \"gut feeling\" persists despite normal investigations, and you decide to refer your patient for specialist consultation, document your concerns on the referral with as much detail as possible. Another option is to seek specialist advice ( see Advice Options ) to convey your concerns. PRIMERS Iron Primer Evaluation of measures of iron storage can be challenging. Gastrointestinal (occult) blood loss is a common cause of iron deficiency and should be considered as a cause when iron deficiency anemia is present. Menstrual loss es should also be considered. There are two serological tests to best evaluate iron stores (ferritin, transferrin saturation) - neither of which are perfect . The first step is to evaluate ferritin : If the ferritin is below the lower limit of normal (lower limit of normal is 30 \u00b5g/L for men and 20 \u00b5g/L for women), it is diagnostic of iron deficiency with high specificity (98% specificity). Ferritin is an acute phase reactant which may be elevated in the context of acute inflammation and infection . If ferritin is normal or increased, and you suspect it may be acting as an acute phase reactant, order a trans ferrin saturation test (see below). o However, if the ferritin is > 100 \u00b5g/L and there is no concurrent significant chronic renal insufficiency, iron deficiency is very unlikely - even in the context of acute inflammation/infection. The second step is to ev aluate transferrin saturation : The transferrin saturation is a calculated ratio using serum iron and total iron binding capacity. Serum iron alone does NOT reflect iron stores. Low values (< 16%) demonstrate low iron stores in conjunction with a ferritin < 100 \u00b5 g/L. In the absence of abnormal iron indices, anemia may be from other causes other than GI (occult) blood loss ( e.g., bone marrow sources, thalassemia, and sickle cell anemia). Microscopic Colitis Primer Microscopic colitis is a benign condition with a median age of onset in the mid-60s , more often in women than men. It is chara cterized by non -bloody, watery/secretory diarrhea having significant potential impact on quality of life. Atypical presentations can also occur. Examination by colonoscopy reveals normal findings, inflammation is present only histologically (on biopsy). Medications have been implicated in the pathophysiology. Common offenders include NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), statins , topiramate, and SSRIs. Consideration should be given to stopping these medications , if possible. This condition is non- progressive, and therapy is directed to improving quality of life and stool habit regularity (<3 stools per day, minimal water content). Treatment for microscopic colitis is similar to those used in the treatment of IBS. o Increased soluble fibre (psyllium, inulin) can be helpful to regular stool habit in addition to loperamide, as needed. o For more significant manifestations (defecation at night, incontinence) , corticosteroid therapy may be indicated ( e.g., Budesonide/ Entocort\u00ae or Cortiment\u00ae (little to no evidence exists for prednisone). Total treatment duration ranges on response from 6- 8 weeks to 12 weeks. Last Updated: June 2023 Page 12 of 14 Back to Algorithm Provide Feedback BACKGROUND About this Pathway Digestive health primary care pathways were originally developed in 2015 as part of the Calgary Zone's Specialist LINK initiative. They were co-developed by the Department of Gastroenterology and the Calgary Zone's specialty integration group, which includes medical leadership and staff from Calgary and area Primary Care Networks, the Department of F amily Medicine, and Alberta Health Services. The pathways were intended to provide evidence- based guidance to support primary care providers in caring for patients with common digestive health conditions within the patient medical home. Based on the succ essful adoption of the primary care pathways within the Calgary Zone, and their impact on timely access to quality care, in 2017 the Digestive Health Strategic Clinical Network (DHSCN) led an initiative to validate the applicability of the pathways for Alberta and to spread availability and foster adoption of the pathways across the province. Authors & Conflict of Interest Declaration This pathway was reviewed and revised under the auspices of the DHSCN in 2021 by a multi -disciplinary team led by family physicians and gastroenterologists. For more information, contact the DHSCN at Digestivehealth.SCN@ahs.ca. Pathway Review Process Primary care pathways undergo scheduled review every three years, or earlier , if there is a clinically significant change in knowledge or practice. The next scheduled review is April 2024; however, we welcome feedback at any time. Click on the Provide Feedback button to provide your feedback .
