We all have busy schedules and even busier lives. But making an investment in yourself is one of the best things you can do for your well-being. Simple acts of self-care are known to help manage stress, lower your risk of illness, and increase energy, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Still, becoming in tune with your emotions can be daunting. You may be asking the following: How can I be sure of what exactly I'm feeling? And if I don't know what I'm feeling, how am I supposed to know what to do about it? Mental health apps are an excellent place to start \u2014 and we've attempted to round up the best ones on the internet. They all offer different features, from meditation to mood tracking. But they all have a similar goal: to help users become more in tune with themselves. Once you learn to feel your feelings, you can begin to handle your emotions all the better. Worth noting: Phone apps aren't a substitute for therapy. These mental health apps can be used to supplement time spent with a therapist, but they're only intended to help you manage your mental wellness, not to replace necessary professional help. Ahead, check out nine mental health apps to help tackle symptoms of stress and sadness and improve your overall well-being. Most offer a free version or trial, but we've listed their subscription premiums, since you'll probably want the upgrade. Here's to finding the mental health app that works best for you. \u2014 Additional reporting by Alexis Jones Related: Add These 7 Wellness Apps to Your Daily Self-Care Routine ASAP 1 Headspace: Meditation and Sleep Image Source: Headspace Cost: $13 a month or $70 a year If you're struggling with stress and looking to integrate meditation into your routine to help relieve anxiety, Headspace: Meditation & Sleep is a great place to start.
