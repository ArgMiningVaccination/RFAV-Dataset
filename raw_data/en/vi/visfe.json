The bills aren't going to stop coming, there will never be more hours in the day for all your errands, and your career or family responsibilities will always be demanding. Managing stress is all about taking charge: taking charge of your thoughts, your emotions, your schedule, your environment, and the way you deal with problems. The ultimate goal is a balanced life, with time for work, relationships, relaxation, and fun - plus the resilience to hold up under pressure and meet challenges head on. Aromatherapy/Relaxation Room We're excited to announce our new Aromatherapy program. We have designed a serene, soothing, and relaxing room to give you the stress-free break that you need in your day. This space is located next to the Faculty/Staff Wellness Department in the RN Ellington Health Center and includes a comfortable massage chair, soothing sounds, and diffused aromatherapy in a private space for you to unwind and de-stress. Schedule your 30 minute session via the link below. The essential oils used in this aromatherapy room will change monthly (or more frequently as needed). To support you after your session, don't forget to take home your FREE essential oil of the month roller ball to help support you on a daily basis (these are limited to one per person per oil). We also have the support of an Essential Oil Specialist that can help support you with aromatherapy or essential oil questions. Aromatherapy is the therapeutic use of essential oils. These oils are extracted from plants and trees and distilled, or cold pressed into concentrated oils. As we inhale these essential oils, our olfactory nerve sends signals directly to our brain, supporting different body systems and functions depending on which oils we are breathing. We have researched and chosen pure, high-quality oils to use in our program.

The true sources of your stress aren't always obvious: Start a stress journal to identify sources of your stress A stress journal can help you identify the regular stressors in your life and the way you deal with them. Each time you feel stressed, keep track of it in your journal. As you keep a daily log, you will begin to see patterns and common themes. Write down: - What caused your stress (make a guess if you're unsure). - How you felt, both physically and emotionally. - How you acted in response. - What you did to make yourself feel better. Think about the ways you currently manage and cope with stress in your life. Your stress journal can help you identify them. Are your coping strategies healthy or unhealthy, helpful or unproductive? Unfortunately, many people cope with stress in ways that compound the problem. Strategy 2: Deal with Stressful Situations Using The Four A's Change the situation: - Avoid the stressor. Not all stress can be avoided, and it's not healthy to avoid a situation that needs to be addressed. You may be surprised, however, by the number of stressors in your life that you can eliminate. - Learn how to say \"no.\" Know your limits and stick to them. Whether in your personal or professional life, refuse to accept added responsibilities when you're close to reaching them. Taking on more than you can handle is a surefire recipe for stress. - Avoid people who stress you out. If someone consistently causes stress in your life and you can't turn the relationship around, limit the amount of time you spend with that person or end the relationship entirely. - Take control of your environment. If the evening news makes you anxious, turn the TV off. If traffic's got you tense, take a longer but less-traveled route. If going to the market is an unpleasant chore, do your grocery shopping online. - Avoid hot-button topics. If you get upset over religion or politics, cross them off your conversation list. If you repeatedly argue about the same subject with the same people, stop bringing it up or excuse yourself when it's the topic of discussion. - Pare down your to-do list. Analyze your schedule, responsibilities, and daily tasks. If you've got too much on your plate, distinguish between the \"shoulds\" and the \"musts.\" Drop tasks that aren't truly necessary to the bottom of the list or eliminate them entirely. - Alter the stressor. If you can't avoid a stressful situation, try to alter it. Figure out what you can do to change things so the problem doesn't present itself in the future. Often, this involves changing the way you communicate and operate in your daily life. - Express your feelings instead of bottling them up. If something or someone is bothering you, communicate your concerns in an open and respectful way. If you don't voice your feelings, resentment will build and the situation will likely remain the same. - Be willing to compromise. When you ask someone to change their behavior, be willing to do the same. If you both are willing to bend at least a little, you'll have a good chance of finding a happy middle ground. - Be more assertive. Don't take a backseat in your own life. Deal with problems head on, doing your best to anticipate and prevent them. If you've got an exam to study for and your chatty roommate just got home, say up front that you only have five minutes to talk. - Manage your time better. Poor time management can cause a lot of stress. When you're stretched too thin and running behind, it's hard to stay calm and focused. But if you plan ahead and make sure you don't overextend yourself, you can alter the amount of stress you're under. Change your reaction: - Adapt to the stressor. If you can't change the stressor, change yourself. You can adapt to stressful situations and regain your sense of control by changing your expectations and attitude. - Reframe problems. Try to view stressful situations from a more positive perspective. Rather than fuming about a traffic jam, look at it as an opportunity to pause and regroup, listen to your favorite radio station, or enjoy some alone time. - Look at the big picture. Take perspective of the stressful situation. Ask yourself how important it will be in the long run. Will it matter in a month? A year? Is it really worth getting upset over? If the answer is no, focus your time and energy elsewhere. - Adjust your standards. Perfectionism is a major source of avoidable stress. Stop setting yourself up for failure by demanding perfection. Set reasonable standards for yourself and others, and learn to be okay with \"good enough.\" - Focus on the positive. When stress is getting you down, take a moment to reflect on all the things you appreciate in your life, including your own positive qualities and gifts. This simple strategy can help you keep things in perspective. - Adjust your attitude. How you think can have a profound effect on your emotional and physical well-being. Each time you think a negative thought about yourself, your body reacts as if it were in the throes of a tension-filled situation. If you see good things about yourself, you are more likely to feel good; the reverse is also true. Eliminate words such as \"always,\" \"never,\" \"should,\" and \"must.\" These are telltale marks of self-defeating thoughts. - Accept the stressor (i.e., accept the things you can't change). Some sources of stress are unavoidable. You can't prevent or change stressors such as the death of a loved one, a serious illness, or a national recession. In such cases, the best way to cope with stress is to accept things as they are. Acceptance may be difficult, but in the long run, it's easier than railing against a situation you can't change. - Don't try to control the uncontrollable. Many things in life are beyond our control\u2014 particularly the behavior of other people. Rather than stressing out over them, focus on the things you can control such as the way you choose to react to problems. - Look for the upside. As the saying goes, \"What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.\" When facing major challenges, try to look at them as opportunities for personal growth. If your own poor choices contributed to a stressful situation, reflect on them and learn from your mistakes. - Share your feelings. Talk to a trusted friend or make an appointment with a therapist. Expressing what you're going through can be very cathartic, even if there's nothing you can do to alter the stressful situation. - Learn to forgive. Accept the fact that we live in an imperfect world and that people make mistakes. Let go of anger and resentments. Free yourself from negative energy by forgiving and moving on. Strategy 3: Make Time for Fun and Relaxation Beyond a take-charge approach and a positive attitude, you can reduce stress in your life by nurturing yourself. If you regularly make time for fun and relaxation, you'll be in a better place to handle life's stressors when they inevitably come. Examples of healthy ways to relax and recharge include: - Go for a walk. - Spend time in nature. - Call a good friend. - Sweat out tension with a good workout. - Write in your journal. - Take a long bath. - Light scented candles. - Savor a warm cup of coffee or tea. - Play with a pet. - Work in your garden. - Get a massage. - Curl up with a good book. - Listen to music. - Watch a comedy. Don't get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of life that you forget to take care of your own needs. Nurturing yourself is a necessity, not a luxury. - Set aside relaxation time. Include rest and relaxation in your daily schedule. Don't allow other obligations to encroach. This is your time to take a break from all responsibilities and recharge your batteries. - Connect with others. Spend time with positive people who enhance your life. A strong support system will buffer you from the negative effects of stress. - Do something you enjoy every day. Make time for leisure activities that bring you joy, whether it be stargazing, playing the piano, or working on your bike. - Keep your sense of humor. This includes the ability to laugh at yourself. The act of laughing helps your body fight stress in a number of ways. Strategy 4: Learn to relax using breathing and meditation techniques. You can control your stress levels with relaxation techniques that evoke the body's relaxation response, a state of restfulness that is the opposite of the stress response. Regularly practicing these techniques will build your physical and emotional resilience, heal your body, and boost your overall feelings of joy and balance.

Strategy 5: Get familiar with how you respond to stress When it comes to managing and reducing stress quickly in the middle of a heated situation, it's important to be familiar with your specific stress response. - Overexcited stress response. If you tend to become angry, agitated, or keyed up under stress, you will respond best to stress relief activities that quiet you down. - Under excited stress response. If you tend to become depressed, withdrawn, or spaced out under stress, you will respond best to stress relief activities that are stimulating and that energize your nervous system. - Frozen stress response (both overexcited and under excited). If you tend to freeze: speeding up in some ways while slowing down in others, your challenge is to identify stress relief activities that provide both safety and stimulation to help you \"reboot\" your system. Strategy #6: Adopt a healthy lifestyle You can increase your resistance to stress by strengthening your physical health. - Exercise regularly. Physical activity plays a key role in reducing and preventing the effects of stress. Make time for at least 30 minutes of exercise, three times per week. Nothing beats aerobic exercise for releasing pent-up stress and tension. - Eat a healthy diet. Well-nourished bodies are better prepared to cope with stress, so be mindful of what you eat. Start your day right with breakfast, and keep your energy up and your mind clear with balanced, nutritious meals throughout the day. - Reduce caffeine and sugar. The temporary \"highs\" caffeine and sugar provide often end in with a crash in mood and energy. By reducing the amount of coffee, soft drinks, chocolate, and sugar snacks in your diet, you'll feel more relaxed and you'll sleep better. - Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. Self-medicating with alcohol or drugs may provide an easy escape from stress, but the relief is only temporary. Don't avoid or mask the issue at hand; deal with problems head on and with a clear mind. - Get enough sleep. Adequate sleep fuels your mind, as well as your body. Feeling tired will increase your stress because it may cause you to think irrationally. "}
