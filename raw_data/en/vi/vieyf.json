Hrdy * I. INTRODUCTION U.S. states have little money to spare on risky innovations in emerging fields such as alternative energy production and water reclamation.1 Yet, each year states offer up billions of dollars in financial incentives such as research and development (R&D) tax credits in order to encourage businesses to locate and invest in their jurisdictions.2 In granting such incentives, states hope to imit ate the success of \"innovation clusters\" like Silicon Valley.3 However, some * Postdoctoral Fellow at Yale Law School Information Society Project.

S. patents and non -patent incentives such as tax credits and research grants for encouraging firms and individuals to invest in developing and commercializing new technologies. Patents could provide states with a new tool for growing regional clusters of districts). 4. Most states use the same criteria as the federal R&D tax credit , though ,many states require the r esearch to be performed in the state. See MICHAEL D. RASHKIN , PRACTICAL GUIDE TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX INCENTIVES : FEDERAL , STATE , AND FOREIGN 275-532 (2007) (providing a comprehensive survey of state R&D tax credits). 5. In this Article I loosel y rely on the basic Schumpeterian definition of \"innovation\" as a temporal process in which inventions (patentable as well as unpatentable) are developed and transformed into useful technologies, products and services with commercial value. See F.M. SCHERER , INNOVATION AND GROWTH : SCHUMPETERIAN PERSPECTIVES 1-31 (1984) (explaining the concept of Schumpeterian innovation); see also Robert P. Merges, Commercial Success and Patent Standards: Economic Perspectives on Innovation , 76 CAL. L. REV. 803, 807 ( 1988) (discussing distinctions between invention and innovation). 6. For example, California's Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO) concluded in 2003 that the state should abolish its R&D tax credit. See Legislative Analyst's Office, An Overview of Califo rnia's Reasearch & Development Tax Credit (Nov. 2003), http://www.lao.ca.gov/2003/randd_credit/113003_research_development.html. The LAO noted that state-level subsidization of R&D activities is difficult to justify, both because of the difficulty of determining the appropriate level for the credit and because benefits, such as knowledge spillovers, cannot be confined to the state.

Part V discusses current legal limits on state patents, including TRIPS, antritrust law, and, most significantly, the IP Clause and the U.S. Patent Act. The Supreme Court has held that states cannot grant \"patent - like\" rights against the world that would potentially compete with U.S. patents as incentives to invest in a particular endeavor or a particular type of endeavor .16 As explained in Part V.C., this rule should be overruled or significantly limited in its scope.17 Instead, this Article pr oposes a new approach to preemption of state patents that asks whether a state patent directly conflicts with an existing U.S. patent or violates the dormant Commerce Clause.18 As explained in Part V.D., the dormant Commerce Clause's more deferential, political process -based approach to judicial review, which focuses mainly on protecting out -of-state businesses and consumers from negative externalities produced by state laws, m ore 13.

See Lichtman, supra note 15, at 714 (discussing the dangers of a strict approach to preemption). 18. An additional limit, discussed in Part V.D.1, infra , is that an inventor cannot rely on a state patent and a federal patent at the same time for the same invention . 2013] STATE PATENTS 491 precisely addresses the risks of state patents than the patent preemption doctrine.19 The Article then provide s a simple , three -part framework for individualized judicial review of state patents under the dormant Commerce Clause. In sum, this new appro ach would help courts weed out overly burdensome patents, while still allowing states to exercise significant autonomy in granting patents and deriving efficient policies for promoting local innovation. II. AMERICA 'S DUAL PATENT REGIMES State patents are s imilar to U.S. patents in that they entail the right to exclude others from using a patentable or unpatentable innovation within the jurisdiction, with the general purpose of rewarding and incenting generation and development of innovation s.20 However, unl ike U.S. patents, state patents can be granted for innovations that do not meet federal criteria of patentability and they may have a variety of features \u2014 such as local working clauses and tailored term lengths \u2014that distinguish them from their federal count erparts. This part explains the key differences between modern U.S. patents and historic state and colonial patents, why the Framers ch ose to transition to a national patent system in 1788, and finally why states largely stopped granting patents once federal patents became available. A. U.S. Patents The IP Clause gives Congress power \"[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries. \"21 The Patent Act, first passed in 1790, gives inventors the opportunity to obtain exclusive rights to make, use, and sell inventions meeting the Patent Act's criteria of patentability.22 Today, the main 19. See, e.g. , Gillette, supra note 7, at 450 (explaining that the dormant Commerce Clause is concerned mainly with the negative effects that state bu siness incentives can produce for out -of- staters, who are unprotected by the political process in the state that granted the incentive). 20. See Bonito Boats, Inc. , 489 U.S. at 158 (distinguishing state \"patent -like\" rights such as Florida's anti -molding statute from state unfair competition laws based on the reasoning that, \"[i] n contrast to the operation of unfair competition law, the Florida statute is aimed directly at preventing the exploitation of the design and utilitarian conceptions e mbodied in the product itself\" in order \" to create an inducement for the improvement of bo at hull designs\" ). 21.

B. State and Colonial Patents The patents granted by the states and American colonies prior to the Constitution provided similar economic incentives to modern U.S. patents but with significant differences .31 State patents conferred the exclusive right (or privilege) to use an invention or innovation in the state.32 The main purpose was to encourage local use of technology that would likely benefit the local community.33 Four essential features differentiated state patents from U.S. patents. First, state patents had a local utility requirement, which indicate d the state believed the invention would ad d value to the community and improve standards of living.34 For example, in 1787, Pennsylvania granted a twenty -one year patent for an angle -measuring device that the inventor attested would supply an \"instrumental solution of all cases of trigonometry\" th at might arise in surveying land in the state.35 Second, due to flexible standards of patentability, states had 31.

Rather, they were specifically tailored to meet the needs of the patentee and the particular technology at issue, with patent terms oscillating between seven and twenty years.42 In short, as Oren Bracha wrote, early patent -granting 36.

State Patents Following Ratification of the Constitution If states already granted their own patents, why di d the Framers decide to give the new national government the specific power to grant its own patents in the Constitution?44 The main reason, according to historians of U.S. patent law, is that state patents did not span a broad enough jurisdiction to effectively protect inventors from copying once the states began trading more actively with one another toward the end of the 1 8th century.45 This situation prompted American inventors to lobby for national protection.46 At least some of the Framers agreed, as evidenced by James Madison's famous comment in the Federalist No. 43, that, due to their limited jurisdiction, \"[t]he Stat es cannot separately make effectual provision for either of the cases [patent or copyright].\"47 No one objected when the IP Clause gave the national government the power to grant patents. Nonetheless, when drafting the IP Clause, the Framers deliberately left states independent authority to grant patents.48 The extent to which states could exercise this authority without conflicting with federal patent law remained a contentious issue.

Ogden , Thomas Gibbons challenged the steamboat patent in federal court.54 In his oral argument, the Attorney General of the Un ited States William Wirt argued that, based on Congress's powers under the IP Clause and the Patent Act, states' powers to grant patents were fully preempted.55 But Chief Justice John Marshall ignored the Attorney General's arguments and declined to overru le or even address Justice Kent's strongly worded support for concurrent state patent powers.56 Nearly ten years later, future Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story explicitly endorsed Kent's view of concurrent power in his 1833 Commentaries on the United Sta tes Constitution.57 The Supreme Court cited to Kent's opinion as late as 1878.58 Livingston 's holding that states have concurrent constitutional authority to grant patents has never been expressly overruled.59 III.

Given the externalities associated with the creation of new inventions and the difficulty of protecting them in an interstate market \u2014along with the heavy administrative cost of multiple state patent offices \u2014it would be expensive, inconvenient, and socially wasteful if inventors had to rely solely on a patchwork of state rights.60 Given that the U.S. government now grants patents of national jurisdiction, and U.S. states have not concurrently granted patents since the early 19th century, it might be assumed that concurrent state patent regimes are unnecessary and obsolete. Since most inventions can potentially be marketed in interstate commerce, why would any inventor seek onl y state -level exclusivity? Since states cannot internalize all the benefits of the research and information produced by state patents, why would any state agree to grant such a right? Finally, if states did start granting patents, why should federal cour ts permit such laws to survive preemption under the Patent Act and the dormant Commerce Clause? The Supreme Court indirectly addressed these questions in 1973 in Goldstein v. California , where the Court had to decide whether a California law could prohibit unauthorized copying of sound recordings, even though the Copyright Act was silent on this issue.61 Upholding the California law, the Court explained that states possess concurrent authority to grant intellectual property (IP) rights in their own jurisdictions.62 Although the Court distinguished prior case law respecting states' concurrent authority in patent law,63 in reaching its 60.

Distinguishing its prior decisions in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co. , 376 U.S. 225 (1964), and Compco Corp. v. Day -Brite Lighting , 376 U.S. 234 (1964), the Court explained that U.S. copyright law did no t address sound recordings at all, and never said they could not be copyrighted. Goldstein , 412 U.S. at 569. In contrast, the Court stated, the Patent Act \"indicated not only which articles in this particular category Congress wished to protect, but whic h configurations it wished to remain free.\" Id. The Court provided no basis for this distinction, simply suggesting that the Patent Act creates a negative inference that any objects that do not meet the federal standards of patentability cannot be simila rly protected by state laws \u2014even though the Patent Act, unlike the Copyright Act, has no express preemption provision. 498 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 decision, the Goldstein Court made several observations that explain why states should retain some autonomy to grant their own patents. A. The Local Nature of Innovation The Court's first observation was that, even in an interstate and global economy, not all innovations are of national importance, or of equal importance to all states.64 Quoting Chief Justice John Marshall in Gibbons , the Court stated that \"the basic principle of federalism\" is that the federal government' s 'action is to be applied to all the external concerns of the nation, and to those internal concerns which affect the States generally; but not to those which are completely within a particular State, which do not affect other States, and with which it is not necessary to interfere, for the purpose of executing some of the general powers of the government.'65 This distinction between objects of national and local importance is highly relevant to patent law as well as copyright. In explaining that the IP Cl ause does not preclude states from protecting expressive works like sound recordings, the Court explained that, although the Clause \"recognizes the potential benefits of a national system, it does not indicate that all 'writings' are of national interest o r that state legislation is, in all cases, unnecessary or precluded.\"66 To the contrary, the Court stated, \"[t]he patents granted by the States in the 18th century show . . . a willingness on the part of the States to promote those portions of science and the arts which were of local importance.\"67 Today, even more so than in the 1800s, technological innovation is a local enterprise, both with respect to innovations themselves and with respect to the communities that produce innovation.68 Many examples of 64.

See id. at 557 -58 (noting that increased diversity across the 50 states today means some innovations will be of \"purely local importance\"). See also Miller, supra note 6 2, at 749 (\"[T]he fruits of intellectual labor constitute a large share of our national wealth, necessitating careful policy formulation. . . . [T]he industries associated with this vast creative output are distributed unevenly throughout the United States \u2014with some states, like California and New York (and more recently Illinois and Texas), forming the home bases for a disproportionate number of creativity -driven enterprises and a large share of the idea marketplace.\"). John Duffy has also observed that an important limitation on the argument that patent externalities justify a global patent regime is that 2013] STATE PATENTS 499 geographically localized innovations exist in the agricultural sector, for instance , such as the special rootstock grafts designed by researchers at the University of California, Davis to combat nematodes and fungi that decimate grapes in Northern California .69 The oil and gas industry, which generally relies on immobile resources, is full of examples, such as new drilling methods like \"fracking.\"70 Perhaps most importantly from the perspective of cash -strapped states and cities, many of the technologies rela ted to infrastructure and \"local public goods\" (e.g. parks, fire prevention , crime prevention ) are specific to and used in a particular geographic location.71 The communities responsible for the generation of innovation are also often geographically localiz ed.72 As Michael Porter puts it, from the aircraft equipment and design companies located in Seattle, to the companies researching advanced materials in Pittsburg, \"[t]oday's economic map of the world is dominated by . . . clusters.\"73 Many of these cluste rs are centered specifically around universities in order to benefit from proximity to talent and the potential for knowledge spillovers.74 As Suzanne Berger and her team at MIT recently technical knowledge developed as a result of a patent system does not necessarily benefit everyone in the world equally. Duffy, supra note 12, at 699. Jeanne Fromer's data on patent litigation in the district courts shows that there is \"a good deal of technology -specific clustering of patent litigation happening in the district courts.\" Fromer, Patentography , supra note 12, at 1496. 69. The rootstock grafts were developed at the University of California, Davis. See Michael Porter, International Perspective on Young Vine Decline , PRACTICAL WINERY & VINEYARD JOURNAL , May/June 2001, available at http://www.practicalwinery.com/mayjun01p14.htm. Many historic state patents were for inventions related to agricultur e. See also BUGBEE , supra note 3 1, at 92 (cotton), 93 (rice), 99 (wheat, grain). With thanks to Robert Merges for this hypothetical. 70. Ever since \"fracking\" was developed, it has been of imme nse importance to the economies of states such as Texas and states that harbor the Marcelus Shale, a deep repository that runs through West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Notably, fracking was not an innovation independently developed in the private sector but was aided by support from the federal government and companies that took a long time to implement fracking due to high cost and risk. Kevin Begos, Fracking Developed with Decades of Government Investment , THE HUFFINGTON POST, Sept. 23, 2012, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/23/fracking -developed -government_ n_1907178.html . 71. Generally, the federal government supplies pure \"public goods\" that are \"nonrivalrous\" and \"nonexcludable,\" such as national defense. COOTER , supra note 9, at 105.

Innovators Do Not Need Full Internalization of Benefits Of course, state patents would not allow patentees to enforce their patents or demand license fees outside the state. They would not enable internalization of profits to the same extent as U.S. patents. But this leads to the Goldstein Court's second observation: the limited jurisdiction of state -level protections does not necessarily render an exclusive right worthless to the recipient; it merely reduces its economic value.78 Even though state citizens w illing to travel across state lines can in Santa Clara into a technology hub); id. at 224 (describing how local universities serve as anchors for urban economies in Boston, Minneapolis, and Atlanta); Peter Lee, Patents and the University , DUKE L.J. (forthcoming 2013) (discussing the relationship between universities and patenting). 75. BERGER , supra note 3, at 216. 76. Daniel Kazhdan pointed out to me that the Supreme Court inadvertently recognized the existence of innovations of local import in a completely different context. In a time before the establishment of the Federal Circuit, the Court sometimes had to decide whether to review a particular patent infringement case even when there was no circuit split. In deciding to review the case anyway, the Court stated that some indus tries are so concentrated in certain geographical locations that patents covering technologies used in those industries were simply unlikely to produce litigation in other circuits . See, e.g. , Muncie Gear Works v. Outboard, Marine & Mfg. Co ., 315 U.S. 759, 766 (1942) (deciding to review a Seventh Circuit decision respecting a patent on an invention to prevent cavitation for water -cooled outboard motors). 77. Goldstein v. California , 412 U.S. 546, 557 (1973) . 78. Id. at 558 (\"The situation is no different from that which may arise in regard to other state monopolies, such as a state lottery, or a food concession in a limited enclosure like a state park; in each case, citizens may escape the effect of one State's monopoly by making purchases in ano ther 2013] STATE PATENTS 501 potentially escape the reach of a state right, exclusivity within the state can \"still serve to induce new artistic creations within that State \u2014the very objective of the grant of protection.\"79 That is, a state IP ri ght can still serve the purpose for which it was designed even if it does not entail profits on a national scale. This observation is borne out by research suggesting innovators can potentially thrive in purely local markets.80 It also makes sense from the perspective of innovation policy theory. In their important article, Spillovers , Brett Frischmann and Mark Lemley explained that the classic economics view of a \"spillover \"\u2014a failure to internalize all the benefits of one's activity that is likely to lea d to the decision not to invest in the activity \u2014does not apply in the same way when the uncompensated feature of a person's activity is an innovation. The reason is that innovation is uniquely conducive to \"productive reuses\" and may proceed at a more eff icient rate in the presence of decentralized use and competition.81 Thus, its value to society is so much greater than its value to the initial creators that allowing creators to fully internalize all the benefits of their inventions could actually impede the progress of innovation in the long run. From the perspective of innovation policy, this means that : [While] we need some ex ante incentive to innovate, we don't need (and don't particularly want) full internalization of the benefits of an invention. As long as we get enough incentive, the fact that other benefits aren't captured by the innovator doesn't impose any real cost area or another State.\"). 79. Id. at 558 -59. 80. See, e.g. , Motoyama et. al., Leveraging Regional Assets: Insights from High -Growth Companies in Kansas City , KAUFMAN FOUNDATION , July 2013, at 24 (noting that one -third of the entrepreneurs they int erviewed provided products and services only in Kansas City or selected nearby areas and were still able to achieve scale and growth). 81. Frischmann & Lemley , supra note 14, at 281 (\"There is no reason to believe that ownership of an idea by any one individual will best en courage that productive reuse. Innovation is cumulative and is generally spurred by decentralized competition. This is particularly likely to be true of an innovation subject to productive reuse, since no one owner can capture the full value of that innovation anyway. If a company can lock up an invention entirely, the company will have suboptimal incentives to improve it. The owner may (or may n ot) improve on the invention, but no one else will be in a position to do so.\") (discussing prior work by Frischmann). See Robert P. Merges & Richard R.

Many Innovations Remain Unprotected b y Federal Law The Goldstein Court's final observation, which may be the most important when it comes to decidi ng whether states should still be able to grant patents, is that many innovations of potential social utility remain unprotected, or insufficiently protected, by federal law.86 As Douglas Lichtman observed in his article objecting to the Supreme Court's preempt ion of state patent protections, just because an innovation fails to meet U.S. patent law's standard of patentability, that does not necessarily make it undeserving of protection from competition, whether through anti-copying laws or through limited p eriods of exclusivity.87 Likewise, when an invention is patentable, but a U.S. patent , bounded by federal rules regarding subject matter, scope and term length, does not provide 82. Lemley & Frischmann, supra note 14, at 276. 83. The Goldstein Court also noted that the failure to allow full internalization could be a potential upside rather than a downside of state copyright protections, stating : When Congress grants an exclusive right or monopoly, its effects are pervasive; no citizen or State may escape its reach. As we hav e noted, however, the exclusive right granted by a State is confi ned to its borders. Consequently, even when the right is unlimited in duration, any tendency to inhibit further progress in science or the arts is narrowly circumscribed. 412 U.S. at 560 -61. 84. As explained in the next part, inventors must choose betwe en U.S. and state patents. This has been the case since 1793. 85. Hrdy, supra note 10, at 91 -92. 86. 412 U.S. at 558 (\"Since the subject matter to which the Copyright Clause is addressed may thus be of purely local importance and not worthy of national attention or protection, we cannot discern such an unyielding national interest as to require an inference that state power to grant copyrights has been relinquished to exclusive federal control.\"). 87.

REV. 705 (2006) (proposing stronger common law protections for undeveloped ideas that cannot be patented); see also Roin, supra note 15, at 564 -68 (proposing FDA -administered periods of exclusivity for unpatentable drugs) . 2013] STATE PATENTS 503 sufficient incentives to actually practice and commercialize it, this does not indicate that commercialization of the invention would not be beneficial to society or to a state in which the invention might be particularly useful.88 In an ideal world no government intervention would be necessary to ensure investment in developing and deploying socially valuable innovations in the states where they have most value. But investment in innovation is particularly vulnerable to market failure, due both to the difficulty of appropriating the value of information in the absence of legal prote ction,89 and due to high level of risk involved in investing in new technologies or business models.90 As scholars like Edmund Kitch and Ted Sichelman emphasize, the costs of generating an invention are just the beginning of a long road.91 The capital required to commercialize and develop subsequent improvements can be tremendous and require high prospective returns to justify investment.92 When the risk is too great capital resources run dry, and innovators generally turn to private parti es such as venture capital firms (VCs) with higher risk thresholds and plentiful capital.93 But commercially minded VCs may require assurances that a technology has a chance to obtain market power and earn supernormal returns.94 A U.S. patent can make a di fference as it increases the company's chances of obtaining market power; but it is 88.

The first scenario is one in which, even if the innovation is patentable, the inventor or the reviewing investor decides a U.S. patent will not provide sufficient rights of exclusivity to make development worthwhile.96 Inventors may perceive this reality up front and choose to forego patenting in the first place, relying instead on trade secret protection or other market advantage s; or they may choose to let their patents expire without making attempts to develop them.97 Here a state patent, perhaps with a longer term or a broader scope, could provide an alternative form of incentive. The second scenario is one in which the innovat ion is simply not patentable.98 This includes inventions that have already been disclosed or used in other jurisdictions, but that are prohibitively expensive to adopt and commercialize in the state.99 An example of the second scenario comes from a \"super high density\" olive harvesting technique long used in Spain and Italy, but only recently adopted by olive growers in California.100 Adoption of the technique has contributed to 95.

States' Non -patent Alternatives Without the power to grant patents , states use a variety of non -patent incentives to encourage companies to innovate and perform R&D in the state.105 While grants for early stage research are largely the purview of the federal government,106 R&D tax incentives, offered by thirty -four states a s of 2010, have become nearly ubiquitous features of states' development policies.107 In theory, R&D tax incentives alleviate the 101.

Instead, patents \"tax\" the public in the form of higher prices.110 Many argue that patents are a more accurate way to determine the appropriate amount for this tax than a cash sum selected by the government \u2014particularly when the government has li ttle information about the future value of the innovation.111 Moreover , unlike grants or tax credits, patents give firms an added incentive to invest in commercially successful derivations of the invention because the reward is \"contingent on success\" \u2014meaning that the patent holder gains nothing from the prospect of an exclu sive comprehensive study of tax credit schemes in New England and studies in other regions, see JENNIFER WEINER , NEW ENGLAND PUBLIC POLICY CENTER STATE BUSINESS TAX INCENTIVES : EXAMINING EVIDENCE OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS 35-42 (2009).

The obvious objection to this point is that the comparatively low political cost of granting patents will lead to unnecessary, over -rewarding patents based on legislative whim or the influence of well -organized lobbyists. As Robert Merges has repeatedly pointed out, one of the unique characteristics of legally granted monopolies is that they are a cheap and easy way for politicians to reward their friends.117 Patents involve no direct expenditure of governm ent funds and represent \"something of a free lunch in the eyes of government: a valuable benefit for which business constituents will be grateful, but which also has a zero impact on the federal budget deficit.\"118 This is one reason Merges and other schola rs generally object to post hoc patent rewards granted by legislators.119 But there are ways to reduce the political economy risks generated by state patents, including requiring policymakers to carefully record the patent review and granting process \u2014as th ey often do for other kinds of innovation awards \u2014and to include patent costs in budget disclosures.120 Judicial review of patent grants, which is discussed in depth in Part V.D, can also play a very important role in limiting the negative effects of the various problems endemic to a legislative patent system. Moreover, it is important to note that tax credits \u2014because they are paid for by foregone revenues rather than direct cash outlays \u2014also impose a delayed tax and may be equally vulnerable to the temptati on of political gifts.121 investments were wasted on an electric car company that eventua lly filed for bankruptcy). 117. See, e.g. , Merges, supra note 11 3, at 111 (noting that intellectual property rights are \"a valuable benefit for which business constituents will be grateful\"). This issue is also addressed below in the discussion of state p atents' \"local utility\" requirement. See infra Part IV.A. 118. Merges, supra note 11 3, at 111. 119.

Tax breaks usually do not involve direct cash outlays like direct subsidi es or grants, and are instead \"paid for\" in tax revenue losses. See WEINER , supra note 10 7, at 5 -6 (providing the dollar amount of tax revenues \"spent\" on tax incentives in East Coast states). Thus, policymakers may grant them more liberally and be more susceptible to lobbying and rent -seeking than they would if they were required to account for the expenditure. Daniel Coenen and others theorize that this may be why courts are more likely to uphold subsidies than tax incentives in dormant Commerce Clause 2013] STATE PATENTS 509 Scholars hotly debate the efficacy of non -patent incentives versus patent incentives.122 It may not be the case that state patent incentives are always superior to grants, prizes, or tax credits for incenting investment in innovation s\u2014but certainly a healthy mix of patent and non-patent incentives may be the best medicine for a grounded innovation policy.123 Indeed, historically, patents were only one of many business incentives that states and colonies used to promote development of risky new technologies.124 At present, states do not grant any patents. To correct this imbalance, states should be able to grant patents in cases where the state reasonably believes patents would work better than non - patent options or would effectively sup plement those other options. IV. REINTRODUCING STATE PATENTS Having now explained why states, if not the federal government, may have strong incentives to use exclusive rights to promote investment in certain innovations, and why those rights might prove valuable to innovators and the communities they inhabit, the next hurdle is to explain how this business incentive would work in practice. In his proposal for state-level protections, Douglas Lichtman limited states to passing anti- copying laws to protect local industries that are vulnerable to particularly cheap and effective modes of copying .125 However, the premise of this Part is that states should go further by granting their own patents: statutory rights that provide l imited -in-time rights of exclusivity over an innovation within the state's jurisdiction, regardless of whether the innovation is patentable at the federal level. Similar to federal patents, decisions. See Dan T. Coenen, Business Subsidies and the Dormant Commerce Clause , 107 YALE L.J. 965, 1032 -35 (1998) (discussing competing state subsidies and potential effects). But see Hemel & Ouellette, supra note 106 (noting that it \"seems clear that the costs that appear on the federal budget\" from patents are far smaller than those from other incentives). 122. See, e.g. , Amy Kapczynski, The Cost of Price: Why and How to Get Beyond Intellectual Property Internalism , 59 UCLA L. REV. 970, 1023 (2012) (arguing that the U.S. government relies too heavily on IP incentives). 123. See Frischmann, supra note 90, at 349 -50 (noting that intellectual property rights are not necessarily the best tool for promoting innovation an d should be mixed with other mechanism of promotion). See also Carroll, supra note 11 3, at 1410 -13 (arguing that subsidies should be used along with intellectual property rights to promote innovation); Hemel & Ouellette, supra note 10 6 (arguing that which incentive to adopt depends on a range of factors including the government's ability to evaluate projec ts, risk aversion of inventors, efficiency of capital markets, deadweight losses resulting from taxation and monopoly, administrative costs, political economy conside rations, and distributive justice considerations). 124. Owning Ideas , supra note 3 3, at 99. 125. See discussion of Lichtman's work in Part V.C, infra . 510 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 the general purpose of state patent rights would be to provide an ex post reward and ex ante incentive for the innovator to expend effort in deriving, developing, or marketing the innovation in the state. State patents could also act as a useful \"signal\" for investors, potentially causing them to invest in a company's technology, thereby helping innovators in emerging fields obtain access to private funding.126 As mentioned in the introduction, intergovernmental experimentation in designing state patent laws provides value, and state patents should not be restricted to a particular format; however, following historical precedent also provides value. Not only did the patents granted by states and colonies retain a protected status under the IP Clause and the Tenth Amendment,127 but they were in use for over two hundred years and may have played a role in promoting innovation in America.128 Therefore, this section proposes an idealized version of modern state patents largely based on their historic counterparts. As discussed above, state patents were historically granted in in dividual statutes by the legislatures.129 Besides their limited jurisdiction, four features distinguished them from U.S. patents: (1) local utility requirements, (2) flexible standards of patentability, (3) local working requirements, and (4) tailored scope s and term lengths. Below is an explanation of how each of these four features would work in a concurrent system of patent protection and how they would contribute to the dual goals of promoting innovation and local economic development. Finally, the Art icle presents a hypothetical state patent for horizontal drilling technology in North Dakota. 126. The primary utilitarian justifications for patents are the incentiv e-to-invent and incentive - to-disclose theories. Rebecca S. Eisenberg, Patents and the Progress of Science: Exclusive Rights and Experimental Use , 56 U. CHI. L. REV. 1017, 1024 (1989). The incentive -to-innovate and prospect theory justifications add that the chance of obtaining a limited patent monopoly will entice patent holders to invest still more time and capital, after an invention has been made, to develop, perfect, and market it to the public. See id. at 1036 -45 (explaining Joseph Schumpeter's and Edmund Kitch's famous theories). In today's world of high financing, U.S. patents also may serve as a useful signal for capital -rich investors that a particular innovation or company is a good investment. Clarisa Long, Patent Signals , 69 U. CHI. L. REV. 625, 653 (2002). 127. See Hrdy, State Patents in the Age of Laissez Faire , supra note 3 2, at 70 -74 (detailing the evidence that states retained patent -granting rights). 128. See id. at 104 -08 (discussing New Yo rk's steamboat patent as market -corrective). 129. Today, states could grant patents by individual statutes, they could grant patents by utilizing state agencies that would review patents and recommend them to the legislature, or state agencies could issue patents directly under delegated authority. State agencies could also grant patents by applying a framing statute crafted by the legislature, as the PTO does under the U.S. Patent Act. 2013] STATE PATENTS 511 A. Local Utility Requirement The most controversial feature of state patents is likely to be that they have a local utility requirement. This means that the applicant for a state patent must detail specific benefits that his or her innovation will bring to the state.130 As Oren Bracha described it, historically, [t]he usual procedure involved a petition of the would be grantee to the assembly detailing his inve ntion as well as the particular benefits it had to offer to the public and praying exclusivity privileges. In a fashion similar to the early English grants [,] applicants usually detailed specific tangible benefits offered by their inventions such as lower prices, the supply of a scarce commodity or the saving of labor.131 To satisfy the local utility requirement today, we can imagine that the putative benefits of a proposed innovation could be wide -ranging. An innovator could cite, for instance, higher prof its in a local industry and more jobs for local workers or enhanced standards of living for state citizens . Ideally, states would use the local utility requirement to direct patents at technologies that promote long -term social goals, but where firms lack sufficient incentives to develop and bring new innovations to the market.132 An example is the alternative energy field, where new means of producing energy are difficult to promote alongside cheaper alternatives like coal and natural gas.133 Hypothetical s ubject matter for state patents includes t he solar -powered electric car -charging stations that the government recently installed in St. Paul, Minnesota;134 the \"artificial leaves\" under development with federal funding in Berkeley, California (which convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into chemical fuel using a process similar to photosynthesis);135 a \"power 130. See supra Part II.B. 131. Owning Ideas , supra note 3 3, at 100. 132. As Tim Wu explains, \"the need to provide incentives for product investments depends strongly on the availability of returns from the market. The stronger the market returns, the less government encouragement in the form of intellectual property rights is needed. . . . [In contrast, when the] are weak . . . [t]he case for strong intellectual property rights is at its zenith.\" Tim Wu, Intellectual Prop erty, Innovation, and Decentralized Decisions , 92 VA. L. REV. 123, 146 -47 (2006). 133. See Mohamed T. El -Ashry, National Policies to Promote Renewable Energy , 141 DAEDALUS 105, 109 (2012) (describing types of policies city and local governments typically use to promote investment in renewable energy, including tax credits, grants, and direct cash subsidies). 134.

A local utility requirement comports with the Goldstein Court's notion that states should retain authority to use exclusive rights to promote technologies that the state deems of particular \"local importance.\"138 But a local utility requirement cuts against the modern notion that pate nt law is normally \"not the proper place to conduct technology assessment.\"139 As Michael Abramowicz put it, with respect to the possibility of government -administered \"patent auctions,\" even if we could be sure that there are technologies \u2014or even entire technological fields \u2014in which patents would be efficient, \"the question remains whether the government could do a good enough job in identifying the relevant fields.\"140 Another problem is political economy. Nineteenth century proponents of historic state p atent laws often argued that state legislators, unlike royal monarchs, are elected representatives of the people who \u2014it is assumed \u2014act for the public good.141 Today, we might be less willing to believe that state legislators act in the best interests of the public at all times.

Politicians might also be subject to lobbying and rent seeking by powerful interest groups promising political support in exchange for patents.143 Thus, r elying solely on politicians to decide when to deny and grant patents could reduce rather than increase investment in innovation. After all, the saying goes, \"if horses could have voted, there never would have been cars.\"144 An initial response to the \"anti -regulatory\" critique is that the states already selectively subsidize innovations that have become \"political projects\"; they just use non -patent incentives like tax cred its to accomplish this goal.145 A second response is that concerns about government in tervention in the process of innovation are largely misplaced in this context. U.S. patent law \u2014like the patent laws of m ost developed countries \u2014already offers patents on a relatively technology - neutral basis ; and s tate patents can never replace U.S. paten ts because of their limited jurisdictions.146 This has two important implications. First, the effects on overall investment in technological development would likely be minimal , since few would choose state patents over U.S. patents . Second, the major cos ts generally associated with using patents to subsidize selected innovations \u2014namely, blocking or delaying competitive entry, over -centralizing decision -making, and hindering future innovation in the industry147\u2014simply do not apply with equal 142.

Flexible Standards of Patentability The second distinct historic feature of state and colonial patents was that they were granted based on flexible standards of patentability. Unlike U.S. patent law, state and colonial patent laws did not require inventors to meet predetermined criteria of patentability like novelty or nonobviousness.150 As explained in Part II, the se early patents did not necessarily seek to promote production and disclosure of entirely new information. Ever since 1790, this has been purely the domain of the federal government.151 Instead, historical state and colonial patents primarily focused on w hether a local patent would lead to successful introduction of technology that benefited the local community.152 This is the role state patents would ideally play today. In granting patents, state governments should be less concerned about whether particul ar subject matter is new, let alone \"nonobvious.\" Instead, they should focus on whether granting a patent would lead to successful development and local working.153 A more relaxed novelty standard cuts against the modern assumption that a primary purpose of intellectual property law is to generate incentives for the disclosure of new information .154 The Supreme Court particular the danger of removing incentives to invent). 148. See Merges & Nelson, supra note 81, at 872 -75 (1990). 149. See Wu, supra note 13 2, at 134 (describing one of the chief costs of IP law as preventing market entry of potential innovators). 150. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102, 103 (2006). 151. See Biagioli, supra note 3 3, at 1138 -39 (explaining U.S. Patent Act's new and unique focus on information disclosure). 152. See id. at 1138 (explaining the requirement of reduction to practice). 153. See Sichelman, Commercializing Patents , supra note 15, at 404 (advocating relaxed novelty st andards for commercialization patents). See also Lichtman, supra note 15, at 714 -15 (noting that states may play an important role in protecting unpatentable innovations). 154. See Kapczynski, supra note 12 2, at 981 (explaining that IP scholarship currently focuses on the information benefits of IP law). Patents' efficacy in promoting disclosure is debated. See, e.g. , Lisa Larrimore Ouellette, Do Patents Disclose Useful Information? , 25 HARV. J.L. & TECH. 545, 549 (2012) (arguing that patent disclo sures provide many benefits). 2013] STATE PATENTS 515 has remarked that the information disclosed in a patent is \"of such importance to the public weal that the Federal Government is willing to pay the high price of 17 [now twenty] years of exclusive use for its disclosure, which disclosure, it is assumed, will stimulate ideas and the eventual development of further significant advances in the art.\"155 However, conceiving of the patent as a contract i n which new information is disclosed in exchange for the high price of an exclusive right is a relatively modern development .156 The state patent is a different kind of contract entirely: the patentee accepts an exclusive right in exchange for agreeing to d evelop and deploy an innovation that would not otherwise exist in the state. So long as state patents do not interfere with U.S. patent law's own goal of disclosure, the two incentives can exist side by side.157 If absolute novelty and informational disclos ure are not the main considerations of state patents, what standard of patentability should states employ to promote local working? States could build loosely off Michael Abramowicz's and John Duffy's suggestion, itself based on the Supreme Court's insigh t in Graham v. John Deere : that patents should be granted based on an \"inducement standard\" of patentability, which restricts the award of a patent to those inventi ons which \"would not have been disclosed or devised but f or the inducement of a patent.\"158 Although state governments need not apply precisely the same economic analysis that Abramowicz and Duffy recommend, at the most general level, the decision to grant a state patent should take into account both the legislature's assessment of the need for th e patent and the likely benefits to the public from granting an exclusive right \u2014what Oren Bracha called a \"specific calculus of the public good.\"159 The analysis would have to be altered in two foundational respects. First, Abramowicz and Duffy assume feder al courts will perform the patentability analysis after patents are challenged in litigation and that the government will not play a direct role in selecting which technologies 155.

Local Working Requirements The third defining feature of state patents is the local working requirement. The purpose of the local working requirement is two -fold. First, it requires the patent holder to pr ovide consideration in exchange for the patent by deploying the patented innovation in the state.164 Second, it generates a timeline in which this must be completed.165 States can mandate local working in various ways. States can insert an explicit local wo rking clause enumerating that the patent is contingent on the holder successfully developing and practicing the patented invention within the state and within a set timeframe.166 States could also promote 160. On the potential pitfalls of this approach, see DAN L. BURK & MARK A. LEMLEY , THE PATENT CRISIS AND HOW THE COURTS CAN SOLVE IT 104-07 (2009); infra Part IV.D (explaining tailored patent incentives and objections to this approach). 161.

See Abramowicz & Duffy, supra note 15 8, at 1590, 1625 (arguing that the inducement standard should serve as the \"doctrinal polestar\" in part because it is supported by Supreme Court precedent and it provides \"compelling economic justification\" for both granting and denying patents). 163. Id. at 1625 -26. 164. See supra Part II.B (explaining local working requirements in historical state and colonial patents). 165. Id. 166. This is similar to the working requirement Ted Sichelman recommends for commercialization patents: \"The working requirement is straightforward: commercialize the invention or lose the patent.\" Sichelman, Commercializing Patents , supra note 15, at 402 (recommending a timeline for working of \"perhaps three years from filing (adjusted for regulatory delay)\"). However, state patents would likely require local working within the granting state. Such 2013] STATE PATENTS 517 local development by inserting set infringement pena lties into the patents.167 This ensures that if the state patent holder fails to successfully develop the innovation in the state, then others can attempt to do so in exchange for a reasonable royalty; and penalties prevent successful patent holders from de manding excessive royalty rates and raising prices beyond what consumers can afford. State patents' emphasis on local working resembles that of some developing nations; these nations may use local working requirements and compulsory licensing to ensure tha t new technologies enter local markets and benefit local industries.168 But today the U.S. Patent Act imposes no working requirement,169 and, as discussed below in Part V.A., international treaties restrict developed nations ' ability to use working requirements in their patent laws.170 A major reason is the conception that the goal of patent law is to encourage ex ante investments in deriving a patentable invention, and that no further incentive is needed to ensure that patent holders make \"f urther investment in the improvement, maintenance, or commercialization of the product.\"171 If the invention has value at all, the argument goes, then it will eventually reach markets where it is most valued.172 Another reason is apparently a concern that ma ndating working of patented inventions will reduce inventors' incentives to obtain patents, and thus disclose valuable new information to the public, due to a fear that they will be unable to successfully commercialize the invention.173 However, neither of t hese concerns has much relevance to state patents, whose primary goal is precisely to encourage local working of technology in the state in which the patent is granted. If we believe is the case with most current R&D credits. RASHKIN , supra note 4, at 265. 167.

See Fong, supra note 15 6, at 1186 (citing this fear, although providing statistics that suggest the opposite may be true). 518 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 inventions will automatically be implemented wherever they have the most value, then neither local working requirements nor state patents are necessary incentives. Those suspicious of market incentives will find the local working requirement crucial: the requirement not only creates a legal mandate to deploy the invention in the state, it also lets the state control the timeline in which development will occur. The second concern \u2014that mandating local working will reduce inventors' incentives to disclose their new inventions due to a fear that they cannot successfully work the technology in the state \u2014is largely inapplicable. If a state patent's local working requirement leads inventors of patentable inventions to refrain from patenting at the state level, then they already have the option and the incentive to obtain U.S. paten ts instead and disclose their invention in specifications as required by the U.S. Patent Act, which has no working requirement.174 D. Tailored Patent Incentives The final historic attribute of state patents was that their lengths, scopes, and terms were tai lored to coincide with the time, expense, and risk the patentee was likely to incur in developing and implementing a particular technology in the state.175 This contrasts significantly with U.S. patents, which are not tailored in scope and have identical te rms. Besides history, there is no inherent reason why state patents today must be tailored. States could simply adopt their own twenty -year patents or even return to the historic fourteen -year term.176 Yet, it might be better policy for states to tailor p atents to the technology and industry involved. Scholars have identified significant costs associated with uniform \"one - size-fits-all\" patents.177 These costs include, on the one hand, deadweight loss that results when patents \"overprice\" information goods or are granted for inventions that would have been developed in the absence of patent protection;178 and, on the other hand, insufficient 174. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(a) (2012) (requiring only a description of the invention). 175. The character of state patents varied immensely both within states and also between states. See BUGBEE , supra note 31, 57-83 (discussing patents granted by early colonial governments for items such as soap, cigarettes, and salt); id. at 84 -103 (discussing state approaches to patents during 1790s). See also Owning Ideas , supra note 3 3, at 100 -01 (describing case -specific nature of colonial and state patents). 176. Notably, in the 1780s, states began to settle on fourteen -year periods, presumably following the British practice. BUGBEE , supra note 3 1, at 93. 177. See Carroll, supra note 11 3, at 1364 (describing problem of uniformity cost in IP rights) . 178. On deadweight loss, see Michael Abramowicz, Perfecting Patent Prizes , 56 VAND. L. REV. 115, 128 -30 (2003) (arguing substantial economic loss results from delaying issuance of patents). 2013] STATE PATENTS 519 incentives to invest in developing innovations that are particularly difficult or time -consuming to commercialize follo wing invention .179 Thus, tailoring state patents, if tailoring could be done accurately and efficiently , would be objectively superior to one -size-fits-all rights.180 Current scholarship on patent tailoring raises an important objection, however. Although th ey have been active proponents for tailoring U.S. patent law to the needs of different industries, Dan Burk and Mark Lemley contend that the task is best left to federal courts.181 They argue it would be undesirable for Congress to tailor patent rules due t o inadequate information, the difficulty of differentiating among industries and technologies, administrative costs, and the risk of special interest lobbying.182 Burk and Lemley also suggest industry -specific rules might violate the international patent st andards laid out in TRIPS.183 However, these objections do not undermine the proposal that states should tailor state patent incentives. First, as explained below, state patents do not violate TRIPS. Second, many scholars do not share Burk and Lemley's con cerns about patent tailoring, even with respect to federal patents.184 Indeed, as previously discussed, various scholars have recommended that Congress implement alternative forms of U.S. patents.185 Third, Burk and Lemley's major concern is that \"a unitary, unvarying, and monolithic statute\" would be unable to \"supply the correct level of incentive to so many diverse industries with divergent incentives\" and would become 179.

Moreover , state governments, because they are autonomous decentralized regimes, may have a unique advantage for perfecting the practice of patent tailoring. State governments operate at the regional rather than the national level. Thus, states would likely be designing state patents for specific clusters of technologies and industries, and could develop expertise in those areas.187 Unlike Congress, states woul d not be wedded to a single centralized patent policy and could experiment and remain flexible in designing patents that function best in their own jurisdictions. For all these reasons, states might have a unique opportunity to design patent s that better approximate incentives required to innovate . E. A Hypothetical State Patent An example best illustrates how state patents would work in practice. Imagine it is 1985. North Dakota, whose small oil industry supported the state's economy during the 1970s an d early 1980s, is experiencing an economic decline as the state's supply of drillable oil dries up and fewer drilling rigs are built in the state.188 The North Dakota legislature has just learned about new drilling techniques, including horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracking. These new drilling techniques, if successfully developed, could allow drilling rigs to extract oil from the Bakken Formation, a unique group of oil -rich rocks located in the state.189 The state begins offering state patents for qualifying technologies related to extraction of oil from underground geological formations. A company called Meridian Oil,190 whose engineers have been 186. BURK & LEMLEY , supra note 1 60, at 105. 187. See Fromer, Patentography , supra note 1 2, at 1482 (arguing that clustering of patent cases in particular districts could help courts develop industry - and tech nology -specific rules). 188. In reality, the North Dakota oil industry's decline lasted nearly a quarter century until approximately 2005, when horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques be came economically feasible on the Bakken. See Chris Brown, North Dakota Went Boom , N.Y. TIMES MAGAZINE , Feb. 3, 2013, at 29. 189. See id. (\"The Bakken Formation now accounts for 91 percent of North Dakota's oil production.\"). 190. Meridian Oil was the com pany that spudded the first horizontal well in North Dakota in 1987, long before the current boom. Id. See also Julie Lefebvre, Oil Production from the Bakken Formation: A Short History , 32 NDGC NEWSLETTER 1, 2 (2011) , available at https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/newsletter/NL05w/pdf/Bakken%20Formation.pdf (discussing 2013] STATE PATENTS 521 researching horizontal drilling techniques, applies for a North Dakota patent. Meridian provides a spec ification laying out a proposed method for horizontal drilling including related machinery, and a business plan including a detailed development timeframe. Neither the techniques nor the various machinery Meridian proposes are entirely new, and Meridian would not qualify for a U.S. Patent of any significant scope.191 Nonetheless, hoping to encourage Meridian to test and develop this technology on the Bakken Formation, the legislature grants the company a twenty -one year patent. The patent has a local worki ng clause that requires successful development in the state within two years, subject to extensions. The patent also has a compulsory licensing provision that will be triggered following three years of profitable commercial use, assuming competitors seek to use Meridian's technology in the state. Meridian agrees to the patent's terms and begins to invest in the project and raise money from outside investors, who see Meridian's state patent as a sign that the company will prevail and hope to share the profi ts.192 In 1987, after a near -success, Meridian receives an extension on its local working clause. By 1990, Meridian has made its technology cost-efficient and relatively safe, and Meridian starts earning profit from oil sales and licensing fees to other oi l companies like Exxon that also start drilling in the state. North Dakota's economy benefits immensely from new jobs and more taxable revenues. North Dakota spends excess revenues on improving education and infrastructure. By 2005, North Dakota's paten t is considered an economic success and has improved the overall quality of life in the state. V.

See Long, supra note 12 6, at 653 (arguing that patents can provide \"signals\" to investors to invest in a company). 522 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 A. TRIPS State patents may diverge from some of the patent standards laid out in the Agreement on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for member nations of the World Trade Organization (WTO).193 With several important exceptions,194 TRIPS requires that patents be made \"available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new, involve an inventive step and are capable of industrial applica tion[,]\"195 and last a minimum of twenty years from the filing date.196 TRIPS generally prohibits WTO members from discriminating on the basis of technology in granting patents.197 Finally, TRIPS prohibits member nations' patent laws from discriminating as to \"the place of invention\" or as to \"whether products are imported or locally produced.\"198 These prohibitions suggest that patents granted only to local inventors or local producers might run afoul of these rules. However, even if state patents diverge from TRIP S standard s\u2014 whether by offering shorter terms or by mandating local working \u2014and do not fall under any of TRIPS's exceptions, state patents would not implicate TRIPS. TRIPS is a minimum standards agreement for nation states that join the WTO.199 The Uni ted States has already met TRIPS's 193.

Therefore, concurrent state patents that do not meet TRIPS's standards should not be subject to enforcement actions under the treaty. B. Antitrust Law Antitrust law pres ents another potential limit on state patents. The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits certain private business activities that federal regulators deem to be anticompetitive.200 State patents could theoretically be vulnerable to challenges based on Section 1 o r Section 2 of the Sherman Act because they potentially confer market power on a private entity and can be used to restrain trade.201 However, antitrust law should not be used to challenge state patents for several reasons. First, federal regulators may no t have jurisdiction to challenge state patents on innovations that do not significantly affect interstate commerce.202 Second, and more importantly, even assuming federal regulators have jurisdiction, based on existing case law, the \"state action\" doctrine should exempt state patents from federal antitrust review.203 Antitrust law is \"directed primarily (albeit not exclusively) at market restraints and monopolies erected by private business firms.\"204 State patents are not monopolies obtained through private a ction; instead, state patents are exclusive rights granted by an elected government or agency. The s tate action doctrine allows state law to restrict competition in a particular field and maintain prices at above -market rates in the presence of a \"clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to regulate competition\" that is \"actively supervised\" by the state itself.205 Thus, as 200. 15 U .S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-7 (2012). 201.

State patents do not apply outside the granting state's jurisdiction so they may not meet this requirement. See id. (forbidding any \"attempt to monopolize\"). 203. See Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 350 -51 (1943) (\"We find nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature.\").

To survive under state action doctrine, the challenged restraint must \"be one clearly 524 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 John Shepard Wiley has pointed out, assuming a state patent created in a state statute is sufficiently supervised by the state or a state agent \u2014for instance through price regulation and compulsory licensing \u2014then the state action doctrine should defer to state regulators.206 In those cases where the state patent significantly interferes with interstate markets and interests outside the state, the dormant Commerce Clause is the best vehicle to address this co ncern, as argued below in Part V.D.207 C. Preemption of State Patents Under Bonito The most important limit on stat e patents comes from the Supreme Court's current pate nt preemption doctrine. As mentioned in the Introduction, in a unanimous opinion in Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc. , the Court struck down a Florida law that prohibited the use of a direct molding process t o cheaply reproduce boat hulls in the state. It conclud ed that federal patent law preempts states from granting \"patent -like\" rights that do not meet Congress's \"rigorous requirements of patentability\" or that represent a \"significant competitor\" to U.S. patent rights.208 This rule is sup posedly statutory rather than articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,\" and the policy must \"be actively supervised by the State.\" Cal. Retail Liquo r Dealers Ass'n. v. Midcal Aluminu m, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105 (1980). For a sub -state governmental entity, the test is different. See Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Phoebe Putney Health Sys., Inc., 133 S. Ct. 1003, 1011 -12, 1015 (2013) (holding that there was no clearly articulated state policy auth orizing hospital's acquisition of the only other general, acute care hospital in the region, and that the State's grant to Georgia hospital authorities of the power to acquire other hospitals was no different from similar pow ers granted to all corporations ).

Commc'ns Co. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 52 (1982) ). \"But unlike private parties, such entities are not subject to the 'active state supervision requirement' because they have less of an incentive to pursue their own self -interest under the guise of implementing state policies.\" Id.

Fromer, The 2013] STATE PATENTS 525 constitutional.209 But the Bonito Court suggested that the exclusive status of federal patent protection is \"implicit in the Patent Clause itself.\"210 This doctrine arguably does not necessarily preempt states from granting sta te patents based on more rigorous requirements of patentability than U.S. patents apply.211 But state patents that are based on reduced criteria of novelty or nonobviousness , that are granted for subject matter that U.S. patent law otherwise excludes, that have longer terms or broader scopes than U.S. patents , and that generally present realistic economic alternatives to U.S. patents would probably violate Bonito 's rule.212 However, several scholars believe Bonito was wrongly decided.213 A comprehensive account of the Court's complicated opinion in Bonito and the divergent scholarship surrounding the decision is beyond the scope of this Article . But three objections are most relevant to sustaining concurrent state patent laws. First, the Bonito Court never dire ctly confronted the fact that there is no express constitutional or statutory prohibition on states granting Intellectual Property Clause's Preemptive Effect , in INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THE COMMON LAW 265 (Shyam Balganesh, ed., 2013).

See Bonito , 489 U.S. at 154 (noting state regulation of potentially patentable subject matter is not ipso facto pre-empted by federal patent law). 210. For instance, the Bonito Court stated that \"[t]he novelty and non -obviousness requirements of patentability embody a congressional understanding, implicit in the Patent Clause itself , that free exploitation of ideas will be the rule, to which the protection of a federal patent is the exception . . . . To a limited extent, the federal patent laws must determine not only what is protected, but also what is free for all to use.\" Id. at 151 (emphasis added). See also Compco , 376 U.S. at 237 (noting \"[for a state to] forbid copy ing [o f unpatentable goods] would interfere with the federal policy, found in Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8, of the Constitution and in the implementing federal statutes, of allowing free access to copy whatever the federal patent and copyright laws leave in the public dom ain.\" (emphasis added)).

See Hrdy, supra note 10, at 88 -89 (arguing federal patent law does not directly control state patent initiatives).

See Bonito , 489 U.S. at 160 -61 (noting restrictions placed on states as a result of federal preemption). The Federal Circuit has also suggested that the Patent Act preempts the entire field of patent la w, in contrast to unfair competition law. See Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. Harmonic Design, Inc., 153 F.3d 1318, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (finding no field preemption of state unfair competition claims that were related to federal patent laws). But see Interpart Corp. v.

The IP Clause does not mention or address the states in any way.214 The Patent Act, unlike the Copy right Act, has never had an express preemption provision.215 The Bonito Court purported to uphold Goldstein 's position that the IP Clause does not apply to the states and noted the absence of express Congressional prohibitions on states' power to \"adopt rules for the promotion of intellectual creation within their own jurisdictions [,]\" such as trade secret laws.216 But t he Court did not mention states' historic powers to grant pa tents or the reasons the Framers , along with courts and commentators throughout the nineteenth century , chose to keep states' concurrent patent powers intact.217 The Framers consider ed concurrent state patent powers an important concession to state sovereig nty and deliberately chose to retain the powers.218 As John Wiley has also observed, the Court's statement that \"[o]ne of the fundamental purposes behind the Patent and Copyright Clauses of the Constitution was to promote national uniformity in the realm of intellectual property[]\" is misleading ; the Court's only support for this point is the fact that Congress gave federal courts exclusive jurisdiction to hear cases involving federal patents in 1800,219 and James Madison's comments in the Federalist No. 43.

They write: The beneficial effects of competition provide a powerful justificat ion for decentralized decision -making. Competition serves as an important check on poor decisions. In the marketplace, it punishes firms that make poor decisions about product design and price. In the political marketplace, it polices against candidates who adopt stances poorly aligned with the views of voters. And for states and nations, it provides incentives to adopt reasonable laws that will not cause businesses, investment, and individuals to flee the jurisdiction.

Bicro n Corp. , where the Court assessed the risks trade secrets posed to innovation but found them justified given the variety of independent benefits trade secret protections can produce, including providing incentives to generate unpatentable inventions and in formation as well as protecting unaddressed interests such as privacy.228 Third, and finally, although the Court's decision to preempt a state law covering an unpatentable boat hull design was premised on the desire to preserve appropriate incentives to invent and disclose new inventions, the decision may lead to a worse system for promoting innovation.229 As Lichtman has convincingly argued, the Bonito Court 225. See Hrdy, supra note 10, at 84 (noting that state patents \"prevent any single entity from obtaining national control of the invention, spurring competition and productive reuses in other states\" while also giving \"the inventor a 'complete and perfect' right within a chosen locality\"). See also Wu, supra note 13 2, at 126 (emphasizing the importance of decentralization and competition in promoting innovation, citing work by scholars like Robert Merges and Ric hard Nelson). 226. The federalism -based benefit of jurisdictional matching is derived from Charles Tiebout's and more recent fed eralism scholars' theories that state and local governments can offer optimized \"packages\" of goods and services that appeal to a homogenous group of mobile firms and residents, thus ensuring efficient delivery of local public goods based on particularized needs and preferences. See MUELLER , supra note 9, at 77 -83; Yoo, supra note 9, at 1402 (explaining the benefits of federalism as a \"decentralized decisionmaking system that is more responsive to local interests and preference, that can tailor programs to local conditions and needs, and that can provide innovation in creating new programs\"); COOTER , supra note 9, at 105 -06, 129 -30 (explaining that \"people with similar tastes voluntarily luster together in order to enjoy their preferred combination of local public goods\" (citing Charles M. Tiebout, A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures , 64 J. POL. ECON. 416 (1956))). 227. The notion t hat state patents could provide a less risky incentive than tax credits for encouraging innovators to locate in their optimal jurisdictions is derived from Clayton Gillette's article in defense of state business incentives as locational incentives. See Gillette , supra note 7, at 448-51. 228. See Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp ., 416 U.S. 470, 487 -93 (1974) (noting that \"misallocation of resources and economic waste [] would thus take place if trade secret protection were abolished\"). As Steven Yelderm an has pointed out to me, the Court's decision conflicts starkly with antitrust law's state action doctrine, mentioned above, which recognizes the benefits of deferring to state authority in sanctioning local monopolies. 229. This statement is illustrative of the Court's goal to preserve incentives to disclose and invent: A state law that substantially interferes with the enjoyment of an unpatented utilitarian or design conception which has been freely disclosed by its author to the public at large 2013] STATE PATENTS 529 made questionable assumptions about the effects of competing state protections on overall levels o f investment in innovation .230 According to the Bonito Court, competing state incentives might reduce inventors' incentives to generate and disclose inventions meeting the \"rigorous\" federal standards of patentability, diverting their efforts away from gene rating patentable inventions towards any number of lesser innovations meeting states' criteria.231 However, Lichtman contends, allowing states to grant patents covering unpatentable subject matter that nevertheless involves some level of technological risk might just as easily lead to more , rather than less, investment in innovation . For example, it could lead to more investment in expensive and high quality boat hulls that are easy to copy, and less investment in Florida real estate or movie theaters.232 By completely eliminating states' power to grant \"patent -like\" rights \u2014even when those rights are limited to prohibiting particularly fast and cheap forms of copying233\u2014the Court deprived states of their ability to provide exclusive -rights -based protections for unpatentable innovations that might be of high social value. This result leaves states reliant on the variety of cash -based incentives discussed previously in Part III.D . impermi ssibly contravenes the ultimate goal of public disclosure and use which is the centerpiece of federal patent policy. Moreover, through the creation of patent -like rights, the States could essentially redirect inventive efforts away from the careful criter ia of patentability developed by Congress over the last 200 years.

Lichtman, supra note 15, at 718. Perhaps the best testament to Lichtman's point is the fact that, about ten years after Bonito was decided, and one year after Lichtman wrote his article, Congress enacted the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act (VHDPA), which had the purpose to prevent cheap imitation of boat hulls nationwide. See Title V of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, Pub. L. No., 105 -304, 112 Stat. 2860 (1998), 'Vessel Hull Design Protection Act,' codified as 1301 -1332 (1998). 233. Prior to Bonito , the Federal Circuit had upheld a California law prohibiting copying of articles using the plug molding process. See Interpart Corp. v. Italia, 777 F.2d 678, 684 -85 (Fed. Cir. 1985), overruled by Bonito , 489 U.S. at 143 -44. 530 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 The Bonito Court's decision to do away with state protections for innovations that are unpatentable makes little sense given the uncertainty involved in calibrating incentives for intellectual production.234 Not only is it easy for Congress to err in designing incentives to innovate, but it is difficult for judges to evaluate the success of state legislators in supplementing federal incentives .235 Thus, as Wiley puts it , \"[i]t . . . is possible to see the Bonito Boats decision as expressing a federal policy to enforce an optimal regime of innovation incentives\" ; but the opinion \"cannot justify itself on these grounds because we have no reason to consider federal courts to be better judges than state legislators of when added protection is efficient.\"236 In sum, b y striking down the Florida statute and effectively prohi biting other states from granting similar rights, the Court far exceeded the scope of its ability and authority to review the economic efficiency of state law s.237 This is why Justice Kent proposed in 1812 that courts should not take it upon themselves to determine whether a state patent is \"inexpedient or unwise.\"238 In Kent's view, deliberation by elected state legislators is a more legitimate and reliable way to determine whether a patent is economically justified than a substantive judicial review by memb ers of the judiciary.239 For all these reasons, Bonito should be overruled or at least substantially limited in its scope at the next opportunity. State protections for intellectual productions do not, as a per se rule, risk hindering innovation just be cause they compete with federal patent incentives ; and they could produce many independent local and national 234.

Paul Heald disagrees, arguing that the Court properly applied economic analysis in striking down the law because \"the Florida statute has no qualitative requirements\" and \"stimulates the flow of capital into boat hull design and allows boat manufacturers to o btain a monopoly price without any attempt to guarantee that the public will benefit through better boat design .\" Paul Heald, Federal Intellectual Property Laws and the Economics of Preemption , 76 IOWA L. REV. 959, 987 (1991) (emphasis added). 238. Livingston v. Van Ingen, 9 Johns 507, 572 (N.Y. 1812). Justice Kent opined in Livingston that when a court reviewed patents granted by state legislatures, \"the presumption must be admitted to be extremely strong in favor of their validity. There is no very obvious constitutional objection, or it would not so repeatedly have escaped the notice of the several branches of the government, when these acts were under consideration.\" Id. \"These grants may possibly be inexpedient or unwise, but that has nothing to do with the question of constitutional right.\" Id. at 573. 239.

This is not to say that states should have free license to grant patents. Just as with other state business incentives, state patents may impose external costs on other states that the granting state does not have to fully internalize.240 The Bonito Court itself alluded to this risk , albeit with very little discussion, stating that \"absent [a uniform national rule,] each State could afford patent -like protection to particularly favored home industries, effectively insulating them from competition from outside the State.\"241 The Court apparently assumed , however, that the IP Clause and the Patent Act are the proper mechanisms for addres sing this concern.242 But, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized in 1824 , the proper vehicle for judicial scrutiny of state patents is the dormant Commerce Clause.243 Statutory preemption under the Patent Act looks only at whether a state law conflicts with t he goal of federal patent law to promote innovation \u2014 a conflict that does not exist for state patents any more than it does for trade secrets or state R&D tax credits.244 Meanwhile, as explained in the next section, addressing local protectionism and maintai ning the integrity of the national market is the primary function of the Supreme Court's modern dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence.245 240.

As noted below, the Goldstein Court had also taken this approach with respect to copyright. Wiley suggests that state action doctrine is the appropriate channel for addressing concerns about protectionism. Wiley, supra note 20 6 at 303 -04. But this might leave state patents without any federal review. Given the potential risks to out -of-staters, discussed belo w, I think some judicial review is necessary. See Frank Easterbrook, Antitrust and the Economics of Federalism , 26 J.L. & ECON. 23 (1983) (arguing that state action doctrine s hould invalidate state laws that exploit consume rs beyond the state's borders). 243. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1, 239 (1824) (stating that because other issues decided the case\u2014namely, a potential conflict with interstate commerce and direct actual conflict with Gibbons' s federal coasting license \u2014there was no need to address patent preemp tion, and leaving Justice Kent's opinion that states have concurrent patent power intact). 244. Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 478 (1974). 245. As Clayton Gillette writes, explaining the applicability of the dormant Commerce Clause to state locational incentives, generally: Contemporary literature views the Commerce Clause largely as a response to fears that states, left to their own devices, wo uld regulate trade in a protectionist manner, and thus seek to exploit monopolies or otherwise impose external costs that the regulating state did not have to internalize. Thus, states would likely regulate even where regulatory costs exceeded benefits, a s long as those costs are imposed on residents of other jurisdictions, or on politically powerless groups within the regulating jurisdiction.

A Revised Approach to Judicial Review of State Patents In stark contrast to the Court in Bonito , as well as prior sch olars' approaches,246 this Article proposes that, with three major exceptions, states should be able to grant patents outside the bounds of the Patent Act and unrestrained by the limitations of the IP Clause. Courts should strike down state patents in three circumstances: (1) a state patent holder seeks a U.S. patent on the same invention as is covered by his or her state patent in contravention of the Patent Act's historic relinquishment provision ;247 (2) a state patent directly conflicts with a valid U.S. pa tent, in contravention of the Supremacy Clause;248 or (3) a state patent violates the d ormant Commerce Clause.249 Each of these scenarios is discussed in turn below.250 246. Lichtman saw judicial review (apparently under the Patent Act or the IP Clause) as a \"second line of defense\" should states \"err\" in granting patent -like rights. Lichtman, supra note 15, at 731. He suggested that states' authority to grant patent -like rig hts should be limited to passing narrowly tailored anti -copying laws specifically directed at helping developers of innovations in vulnerable markets recoup the costs of development.

Today it seems clear that most legal challenges to state patents would be adjudicated by federal courts base d on their exclusive jurisdiction over all cases \"relating to patents[.]\" See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a) (2011) (\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protect ion, copyrights and trademarks. No State court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, or copyrights.\") Congress reformed \u00a7 1338 in 2011, after the Supreme Court h eld that a counterclaim of patent infringement brought in state court did not necessarily fall within the Federal Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction, in order to clarify that state courts cannot hear such counterclaims. See Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U.S. 826, 831 (2002); see also Leahy -Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L.

Even a case presenting only claims created by state law can still be s ubject to federal jurisdiction if the case involves a federal issue that is (1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal -state balance approved by Congress.

Relinquishment upon Obtaining a U.S. Patent The clearest limit on state patents is triggered when inventors attempt to rely on both state and federal patents for the same invention at the same time. Thomas Jefferson recognized this problem after his term as the first Secretary of State, where he was responsible for reviewing patent appl ications and issuing patents.251 At Jefferson's behest, the Patent Act of 1793 provided that a state patent would be automatically relinquished if the patentee obtained a patent from the U.S. government for the same invention, and that applying for a U.S. p atent would be evidence of such relinquishment.252 Jefferson thought the relinquishment requirement was important because it would prevent U.S. patentees who possessed state patents from getting an unfair advantage over U.S. patentees who did not.253 Today, t his problem would be less likely to arise. Ever since the overhaul of the Patent Act in 1836, patent applications have been reviewed by professional examiners to determine whether an invention meets the Act's requirements of patentability.254 The Patent Ac t does not allow inventors to obtain patents for inventions that were \" patented , described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.\"255 Accordingly, inventors possessing state patents would generally be preempted from later applying for a federal patent on the same invention. That said, the Patent Act makes certain exceptions \u2014 most notably, for disclosures made by the inventor him or herself or disclos ures made by third parties after the inventor has previously made a \"public disclosure\" one year or less before the effective patent filing 251. NATURE OF THE IP CLAUSE , supra note 4 5, at 437 -38. 252. The Patent Act of 1793 required inventors who obtained U.S. patents to automatically \"relinquish\" any patents granted by a state \"before its adoption of the [Constitution.]\" Sec. 7, Act of February 21, 1793, 1 Stat. 317. See also NATURE OF THE IP CLAUSE , supra note 4 5, at 437 ( quoting language that ultimately became a part of the 1793 statute). The substantially revised Patent Act of 1836 does not contain this provision. Patent Act of 1836, Ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117 (July 4, 1836). 253. See NATURE OF THE IP CLAUSE , supra note 4 5, at 437 (discussing Jefferson's early draft of the preemption provision). 254. See MERGES & DUFFY , supra note 2 6, at 8 (describing institution of formal examination system in 1836). 255. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)( 1) (as amended in 2011) (emphasis added). This provision of the AIA has a similar effect as the old Section 102 in the 1952 Patent Act, though it changes the crucial date from the date of invention to the date of filing. See Robert P. Merges, Priority and Novelty Under the AIA , 27 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 1023, 1023 -24 (2012) [hereinafter Priority and Novelty ]. This reflects the Patent Act of 1952's notion of a one -year \"grace period.\" See id . at 1025 (explaining that the \"grace period provision\" is an except ion to the novelty rule). 534 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 date.256 Therefore, public disclosures made by inventors in state patents could potentially qualify for an exception to the Patent Act's novelty bar so long as they are made within one year of filing for the U.S. patent.257 This means, theoretically, that the inventor could fall under the exception by obtaining , for example, a thirty -year New York patent and then applying a few months later for a U.S. patent . The inventor would either get a U.S. patent with a new filing date or get the benefit of the state patent filing date .258 This would effectively lead to around twenty years of nationwide protection followed by ten yea rs of protection only in New York.259 However, even though the Patent Act no longer contains the 1793 Act's relinquishment provision, the Constitution itself may require inventors to relinquish any state patents they possess upon obtaining U.S. patents for the same invention. The IP Clause gives Congress power to secure inventors' \"exclusive Right to their respective . . . Discoveries.\"260 James Madison's statement in the Federalist indicates that the reason the Framers believed this power was necessary was that states could not \"separately make effectual provision\" for patents (or copyrights) due to their limited jurisdictions.261 The entire basis for giving Congress the power to grant patents was that states could not effectively protect the exclusive rights of inventors wishing to market their inventions in interstate commerce. Given this rationale, it seems reasonable to conclude that if the Framers had thought about it, they would have agreed that U.S. patents should not be available when an inventor 256. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b)(1).

For purposes of comparison, those who obtain patents in countries that are part of the Paris Convention and then apply for a U.S. patent get the benefit of the filing date of their foreign patent if they file for the U.S. patent withi n twelve months of the foreign filing date. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119. See also MERGES & DUFFY , supra note 26 , at 498 -99. 259. In my opinion, o verlapping state and federal patent rights would be confusing and unnecessary . But the possibility of state -level term e xtensions is another matter. Justice Kent's dicta in Livingston suggested that , as of 1812, states could grant state patents for inventions whose U.S. patents had expired. Livingston v. Van Ingen, 9 Johns 507, 581 (N.Y. 1812). Thus, in this hypothetical, New York could grant a separate ten -year patent to the inventor following the expiration of his or her U.S. patent, with the same effect of an additional ten years of exclusivity only within New York. This would effectively s erve as a localized patent extension. See, e.g. , Evans v. Jordan, 9 Cranch 199, 202 -04 (1815) (upholding a private bill giving Oliver Evans another fourteen years' worth of U.S. exclusivity for his flour mill). Today, the FDA grants term extensions for p harmaceutical drugs. Roin, supra note 15, at 564 -68. 260. U.S. CONST . art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8. 261. THE FEDERALIST NO. 43 (James Madison), available at http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa43.htm . 2013] STATE PATENTS 535 decided, for whatever reason, that a state patent was an \"effectual provision.\" The states themselves appeared to accept this limitation: some of the states indicated in pa tents they granted after 1790 that the state grant would be void if the inventor later obtained a U.S. federal patent for the same invention under the Patent Act .262 Given this history , the IP Clause, in conjunction with the Supremacy Clause requiring states to follow federal law , should trigger a direct conflict when an inventor tries to rely on both federal and state patents for the same invention at the same time and mandate invalidation of the state patent in favor of the federal patent.263 2. Direct Confl icts with U.S. Patents The second limit on state patents, which Justice Kent recognized in Livingston , is that any state patent that directly conflicts with a U.S. patent will be invalid , so long as the U.S. patent holder proves that the state patent infri nges the U.S. patent and that the U.S. patent is valid.264 This theory is based on direct conflict preemption principles and a plain reading of the Constitution.265 The IP Clause authorizes Congress to secure to inventors the \"exclusive Right . . . to their respective Writings and Discoveries,\"266 and the Supremacy Clause states that the Constitution and the laws of the United States \"shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Law s of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\"267 Once a U.S. patent is issued to an inventor pursuant to the Patent Act, states are generally bound by the Supremacy Clause to 262. See BUGBEE , supra note 3 1, at 102 (discussing voidance clause in a New Hampshire patent for \"building Chimneys and altering those already built\"). 263. See U.S. CONST . art. I , \u00a7 8, cl. 8 (explaining the general right of Congress to grant patents and c opyrights) ; U.S. CONST . art. VI, cl. 2 (Supremacy Clause). Besides state -level \"term extensions,\" mentioned in note 259, supra , another way to get around the preemption provision would be for a state to grant patents lasting under one year. Upon expirati on of the state patent, the inventor could still apply for U.S. patents on the same invention, assuming the state patent falls within the \u00a7 102(b) grace period or is treated like a foreign patent under \u00a7 119 . 264. Livingston , 9 Johns at 582 -83. 265. Kent used Alexander Hamilton's constitutional test for preemption. Livingston , 9 Johns at 576. Today, there are a number of constitutional and statutory preemption doctrines that invoke a similar principle of \"direct conflict\" or \"actual conflict\" with f ederal law. See, e.g. , Dan L. Burk, Protection of Trade Secrets in Outer Space Activity: A Study in Federal Preemption , 23 SETON HALL L. REV. 560, 606 (1992 -1993) (explaining the benefits of a conflict preemption approach). 266. U.S. CONST . art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8. 267. U.S. CONST . art.

Absent some other form of federal authorization for the state legislation, if a court finds that a state patent infringes a U.S. patent, the court would be bound to provide \"competent redress .\"271 Under the Patent Act, the court could grant damages.272 In addition, the Patent Act authorizes injunctive relief.273 268. See Livingston , 9 Johns at 582 . 269. Id. (\"If, then, the respondents were in possession of a [U.S.] patent for their steam -boat, as original inventors , our statute prohibition . . . would possibly, before a competent tribunal, be obliged to yield to the patent right, as being founded on the paramount law.\"). 270. Ted Sichelman addresses the problem of potential conflicts between commercialization patents and invention patents, concl uding that commercialization patent holders should not be subject to injunctions from the holders of un -worked U.S. patents and should be limited to a fixed, small percentage royalty, such as one to two percent. Sichelman, Commercializing Patents , supra note 15, at 405. 271. Livingston , 9 Johns at 582 -83. 272. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 (2006). It is unlikely that the patentee could also successfully sue the state for damages. See Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd. v. Coll. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. 627, 647-48 (1999) (holding that a state was immune from suit in federal court for patent infringement claims where Congress had unsuccessfully tried to abrogate state immunity for such lawsuits). 273. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 283 (2006) (\"The several courts having jurisdiction o f cases under this title may grant injunctions in accordance with the principles of equity to prevent the violation of any right secured by patent, on such terms as the court deems reasonable.\"). According to the Supreme Court's decision in Ebay, Inc. v. Mercexchange, LLC , the federal courts have discretion whether to grant injunctive relief. 547 U.S. 388, 392 (2006) (holding that plaintiffs in patent cases do not automatically get injunctions and relief may be limited to money damages appropriate to compe nsate for any infringement that may have occurred). In his concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy suggested that in deciding whether to enjoin a losing defendant's activity, the court should consider whether the plaintiff was using his patent not \"as a basis for producing and selling goods but, instead, primarily for obtaining licensing fees.\" Id. at 396 (Kennedy, J., concurring). See also Sichelman, Commercializing Patents , supra note 15, at 405 n.366 (explaining Justice Kennedy's pronouncement that \"an injunction may not serve the public interest\" and that his concurring opinion is \"consistent with a market experimentation theory\"). Therefore, if the U.S. patentee is not currently practicing the invention and is simply using the patent to extract exorbi tant license fees, the U.S. patent holder may be limited to damages. See id. at 405 -06 (noting similar operation of Ebay's rule on the author's proposed commercialization patent scheme). 2013] STATE PATENTS 537 3. The Dormant Commerce Cl ause a. The Risk of Local Protectionism and Races to the Bottom As explained above in Part V.C., the Bonito Court erred in its presumption that state patents would necessarily hinder rather than promote innovation. The bigger problem, which the Court only hinted at, is that, like other state business incentives , state patents might be abused to promote local interests at the expense of national interests and trigger wasteful \"races to the bottom\" among states for business activity and revenues.274 For insta nce, a state could begin offering fifty -year patents as a way to compete with other states for the best inventors and for patent filing fees, resulting in overly long and broad rights that are adverse to public welfare.275 This arguably occurred when states were exclusively responsible for granting patents during the 1780s and granted remarkably broad and overlapping patents for the steamboat to the same or different inventors.276 Even when states grant patents that lead to more socially optimal levels of innovation within the state, this could 274. A paradigmatic example of a \"race to the bottom\" comes from sta te incorporation laws, which provide companies with the privilege of being organized under the laws of the state or doing business in the state. Many have argued states have incentives to craft lenient incorporation laws in order to attract corporations, but that this is to the potential detriment of other states and corporate shareholders, who suffer from rules that are overly favorable to management. Lucian A. Bebchuk, Federalism and the Corporation: The Desirable Limits on State Competition in Corporate Law, 105 HARV. L. REV. 1435, 1438 (1992). As already mentioned, another example of a \"race to the bottom\" is R&D tax credits. Some argue that states have created overly favorable credits in order to attract or retain businesses, and that these credits h ave resulted in losses to local taxpayers when states pay too much and deadweight loss from the national perspective because any gains created in one jurisdiciton may be due to less investment in another. See Gillette, supra note 7, at 451 (summarizing thi s argument and other arguments made by opponents of state and city locational incentives). 275. Attorney General William Wirt made this argument in Gibbons v. Ogden , arguing that states would compete against one another to offer the most attractive patent rights in order to convince inventors to locate in their territories. 22 U.S. 1, 169 (1824) (\"This concurrent legislation would degenerate into advertisements for custom. These powers would be in the market, and the highest bidder would take all.\"). Note that because states must also compete with U.S. patents for applicants and filing fees, they may be even more likely to provide excessive terms and scopes due to a \"ratchet effect.\" Most reasonable inventors would not accept a state patent covering precis ely the same subject matter and with precisely the same term and scope as a U.S. patent. Therefore, they would demand state patents with longer terms or broader scopes on otherwise unpatentable subject matter. Thanks to Jack Balkin for this point. 276. See Edward C. Walterscheid, Priority of Invention: How the United States Came to Have a \"First -to-Invent\" Patent System , 23 AIPLA Q.J. 263, 269 -77 (1995) (discussing a patent battle between two steamboat inventors who each claimed state patent rights); Merg es & Reynolds, supra note 11 9, at 45, 48 -49 (explaining the problem of conflicting steamboat monopolies); State Patent Laws in the Age of Laissez Faire , supra note 3 2, at 78 -79 (describing the broad New York steamboat patent). 538 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 simply be the result of firms and investors relocating or investing less in other states.277 States could also adopt any number of \"beggar thy neighbor\" poli cies, such as patents that effectively exclude out -of-state competitors from entering local markets. This arguably occurred in Bonito , where Florida adopted a law that effectively prevented Tennessee boat hull makers from selling boat hulls made using plu g molds in Florida.278 This, in turn, could lead to reprisals from other states \u2014for instance, a Tennessee law prohibiting copying of some product Florida businesses wish to sell in Tennessee . The end result could be a \"thicket\" of un -navigable state patent rights, many of which are not actually necessary to promote innovation.279 Unjustified or over -protective patents and \"thickets\" of patents within a local industry would likely generate deadweight loss and unnecessary transaction costs for residents and vot ers in the granting state.280 But out -of-state firms and consumers would be particularly at risk because their interests may not have been taken into account in legislators' decision to grant the patents.281 True, state patents only apply in the granting sta te and do not directly harm consumers and businesses 277. At least one economic study has attempted to show that increases in local R&D investment as a result of state R&D tax credits are due to less investment in other states. See Wilson, supra note 7, at 433 fig.1. 278. Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boa ts, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 164 (1989). 279. On thickets and patent gridlock, see Michael A. Heller & Rebecca S. Eisenberg, Can Patents Deter Innovation? The Anticommons in Biomedical Research , 280 SCI. 698, 698 -701 (1998) (discussing patent gridlock in the co ntext of biomedical research). See also Michael Mattioli, Communities of Innovation , 106 NW. U. L. REV. 103, 110 -16 (2012) (describing the problem of patent gridlock). That said, s tates could adopt policies to facilitate licensing, such as online clearing - houses, or rely on private ordering solutions like collective rights organizations. See Kirti Gupta, The Patent Policy Debate in the High -Tech World: A Literature Review 3-4 (Northwestern Law Sch. Searle Center Working Paper, 2013), available at http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/programs/searlecenter/workingpapers/documents/Gupta_p atent -policy -debate -literature -review.pdf (discussing private ordering solutions to patent thickets as well as the difficulty of finding empirical evidence that pa tent thickets exist).

Merges, Contracting into Liability Rules: Intellectual Property Rights and Collective Rights Organizati ons, 84 CAL. L. REV. 1293 (1996). 280. This is arguably what happened in Gibbons , where the well -connected and rich businessman Robert Livingston convinced New York to transfer John Fitch's patent on the steamboat to him. Thereafter, steamboat fares rose to excessive rates across the board until the Supreme Court struck down the monopoly. Hrdy, State Patents in the Age of Laissez -Faire , supra note 3 2, at 78. 281. Some argue that out -of-state interests can be protected \"by what amounts to a system of virtual representation\" if similarly situated interests are located in the state and participating in the local political process. See, e.g. , Kellen S. Dwyer, Dormant Commerce Clause Review of Public - Private Partnerships After United Haulers: A Competitive Bidding Solution , 18 VA. J. SOC. POL'Y & L. 203, 222 (2011) (explaining John Hart Ely's virtual representation theory). 2013] STATE PATENTS 539 in other states.282 In fact, they may benefit other states by providing useful information that is free for copying and use outside the state.283 However, state patents could significantly raise the cost o f business for out-of-state firms, as occurred in Bonito ,284 or raise prices for out -of-state consumers of certain localized goods and services.285 b. The Applicability of the Dormant Commerce Clause to State Patents As already alluded to, concern for out -of-state interests is at the heart of the Supreme Court's modern dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Although many contend that dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence is confused,286 \"[t]here is general agreement on the objectives that the Clause seeks to ser ve, typically phrased in terms of creating a 'national market,' or preventing one jurisdiction from discriminating against another.\"287 Adopting a \"political process\" theory of judicial review, courts historically gave deference to state laws that treated i n-state and out -of-state interests alike, and remained skeptical of laws that are more favorable to in -state interests or underrepresented minorities.288 Courts already apply this doctrine regularly in addressing 282. Goldstein v. California, 412 U.S. 546, 558 (1973). 283. See, e.g. , Frischmann & Lemley, supra note 14, at 258 (citing the development of the computer -based spreadsheet as a beneficiary of this phenomenon). See also Hrdy, supra note 10, at 83 (discussing the effect of innovation spillovers). 284. Again, an example is New York's patent on the steamboat in Gibbons , which prevented Thomas Gibbons, a New Jersey operator, from operating steamboats in New York without a license. Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1, 2 (1824). 285. An example is the hypothe tical California patent on the high -density olive harvesting techniques mentioned above. See supra Part III.C. By shielding an in -state company from competition (both domestic and out -of-state), the patent might raise the price of California olives and California olive oil for out -of-state consumers. 286. Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Scalia have suggested abandoning the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine. See, e.g. , United Haulers Ass'n., Inc. v. Oneida -Herkimer Waste Mgmt. Auth., 550 U.S. 330, 349 (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring) (\"The negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the Constitution and has proved unworkable in practice.\"); Tyler Pipe Indus., Inc. v. Washington State Dep't of Revenue, 483 U.S. 232, 260 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and di ssenting in part). See also Edward A. Zelinsky, Restoring Politics to the Commerce Clause: The Case for Abandoning the Dormant Commerce Clause Prohibition on Discriminatory Taxation , 29 OHIO N.U. L. REV. 29, 29 (2002) (\"I conclude that the time has come to scrap the dormant Commerce Clause prohibition on discriminatory taxation. Since the judicially -created prohibition has served its historic purpose, to create a single common market of the United States , it can now safely be laid to rest.\"). But, as discussed below, a clear application of the doctrine does in fact exist in the state patent context. 287. Gillette, supra note 7, at 493 (citing West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 210 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring)). 288. The \"political process theory\" of the dormant Commerce Clause dates back to at least 1938, when Justice Harlan Stone wrote that \"when the regulation is of such a character that its 540 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 challenges to a wide variety of state busine ss incentives, including state tax credits.289 There is no reason it should not apply to state patents as well. But to the bemusement of scholars like Arthur Miller, this is not the direction the Supreme Court has taken when addressing state IP rights.290 In Goldstein , where the Court decided states have concurrent power to create IP protections, the Court did not address the dormant Commerce Clause directly but stated that the doctrine's major concern \u2014namely, local protectionism at the expense of other s tates\u2014was not a significant risk for state copyright laws due to their limited jurisdiction.291 If one state granted a copyright in certain kinds of creative works but other states did not, citizens from other states would still be free to make unauthorized copies of those works within their own borders.292 burden falls principally upon those without t he state, legislative action is not likely to be subjected to those political restraints which are normally exerted on legislation where it affects adversely some interests within the state.\" South Carolina State Highway Dep't v.

See also United Haulers , 550 U.S. at 332 (upholding state forced -use law requiring delivery of all in -state trash to a state -owned facility in part because the main burden of the law\u2014the increased price of waste collection \u2014fell mainly on state residents rather than out -of-state residents); Gillette, supra note 7, at 450 process theory\" view); Hellerstein & Coenen, supra note 7, at 806 (arguing that the court should only strike down a state tax incentive that favors in -state over out -of-state activities and \"implicate[s] the coercive power of the state\"); Dwyer, supra note 28 2, at 222 (explaining that the \"Court has struck a balance\" by giving deference to laws that treat in -state and out -of-state busines ses the same and \"skeptically reviewing legislation that treats local firms better than out -of-state firms . . . because it is thought likely that local firms obtained the favorable legislation via the political advantage they enjoy over their out -of-state counterparts\"). 289. For a thorough canvassing of recent jurisprudence and articles on Commerce Clause challenges to tax incentives designed to entice companies to locate and do business in the state, see BRANNON P. DENNING , BITTKER ON THE REGULATION OF INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE \u00a7 8.05 n.51 (2d. ed. 2012). The Supreme Court recently declined to rule on the constitutionality of the state of Ohio's aggressive tax credit scheme, which allowed businesses to receive credit against the state franchise tax for qualifying investments of \"new manufacturing machinery and equipment\" used within the state, finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the challenge. See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 344 -47 Cuno v. DaimlerChrysler, Inc. , 386 F.3d 738 (6th Cir. 2004), which struck down Ohio's tax credit scheme under the dormant Commerce Clause; and dismissing the case based on lack of Article III standing because the plaintiff taxpayers' injury was too \"conjectural or hypothetical\" and not redressable) .

The Court stated that if states were free to grant \"patent -like\" rights , then they might be tempted to \"afford patent - like protection to particularly favored home industries, effectively insulating them from competition from outside the State.\"295 But the Court did not apply or even mention the dormant Commerce Clause, even though its potential applicability should have bee n obvious.296 The next section provides the doctrine the Supreme Court should have used from the start to address patents and patent -like rights granted by the states. copy within their borders those works which may be protected elsewhere.\" Id. 293. Id. 294.

We do not see here the type of prejudicial conflicts which would a rise, for example, if each State exercised a sovereign power to impose imposts and tariffs; nor can we discern a need for uniformity such as that which may apply to the regulation of interstate shipments.\"). Some argue that the Court's conclusion underest imates the significant impact that a ban on importation of \"pirated records\" would have on the economies of other jurisdictions where the sale of pirated tapings was not illegal. See, e.g. , Miller, supra note 15, at 750; Edward Samuels, Goldstein v. Calif ornia: Breaking up Federal Copyright Preemption , 74 COLUM . L. REV. 960, 969 (1974). 295. Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 163 (1989). Presumably, the Court was worried that Florida's ban on copying boat hulls using the direct plug molding process with the intent to sell them would operate as a de facto tariff, p reventing out -of-state producers of plug-molded boat hulls from selling their wares in the state. The Bonito Court did not mention Goldstein 's analogous discussion of the effects of California's ban on imports of pirated records. The Court's statement in Bonito suggests that it was distinguishing the pirated records example, but a meaningful distinction is difficult to see . Preventing the import of unauthorized copies of sound recordings into California benefited California's sound recording industry at the expense of distributors in states where copied sound recordings remained legal. Preventing the import of boat hulls into Florida that were made using the plug molding process benefited Florida's boat hull manufacturers at the expense of out -of-state c ompetitors, such as those in Oklahoma, that could use plug molding. 296. The dormant Commerce Clause argument was never raised, even though Thunder Craft Boats, Inc. was a Tennessee corporation. After Bonito Boats, Inc. sued Thunder Craft in a Florida Circuit Court to enforce the Florida law, Thunder Craft moved to dismiss based only on the ground that the statute conflicted with federal patent law. Id. at 145. 542 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 c. A Dormant Commerce Clause Doctrine for State Patents Under the dormant Commerce Clause , courts will strike down state laws that facially discriminate against out -of-state entities \u2014for instance, by expressly prohibiting out -of-state companies from doing business or selling merchandise in the state.297 On the other hand, when a party challenge s a facially neutral state law that has adverse effects on interstate commerce, courts apply some variety of balancing test.298 Under the most common variant, the Pike test, the state law \"will be upheld unless the burden imposed on [interstate] commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\"299 If a state' s patents are only available, without exception, for local companies, these patents would likely be treated as facially discriminatory and highly suspect.300 On the other hand, if st ate patents are equally available to all innovators regardless of location, state patents would not be treated as facially discriminatory incentives.301 As described above, historically, state patents were often granted to foreigners.302 These patents usually ha d some form of a local working requirement, obligating the patentee to develop the technology in the state within a certain period of time to maintain the patent.303 But this does not imply a requirement of local residency or investment in local 297. Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U.S. 429, 429 (1980) (explaining the policy at issue, which confined the sale of cement to residents). 298.

See C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, N.Y., 511 U.S. 383, 383 -93 (1994). 301. Although courts may deem state laws that harm both in -state and also out -of-state interests facially discriminatory, \"[f]or pur poses of the dormant Commerce Clause, discrimination is often viewed as disparate treatme nt of in -state and out -of-state interests.\" Jennifer L. Larsen, Discrimination in the Dormant Commerce Clause , 49 S.D. L.

As noted in Part II.B., historically, state and colonial pa tents were used to encourage foreigners to import their inventions to the state issuing the patent. See NATURE OF THE IP CLAUSE , supra note 4 5, at 45 -46. 303. See BUGBEE , supra note 3 1, at 57 -103 (describing variety of working requirements in colonial an d state patents); Owning Ideas , supra note 3 3, at 103 (discussing colonial working clauses), 109 -10 (noting that state patents retained major features of colonial patents). 2013] STATE PATENTS 543 plants and equipment , so long as the patentee has the capacity to function in multiple locations and still ensure local working in the granting state.304 Thus, for example, the holder of a Wyoming patent could be a multi -national corporation with its operati ons located mainly in New York and outsourcing most of its work to China. In contrast, John Fitch, a Pennsylvania reside nt, was unable to meet New York' s working requirement, leading to voidance of his steamboat patent in New York.305 State patents that do not facially discriminate against out -of-staters should be treated under a balancing test, asking whether the state patent imposes a burden on interstate commerce and competition that is \"clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\"306 Building on this general framework, courts should apply the simple three -part analysis proposed below. Importantly, unlike in Bonito , where the Court asked whether the state law over -protected boat hulls in proportion to their \"technological merit,\"307 this is not a patent efficiency analysis in disguise. The goal is to locate negative externalities on out -of-state residents , or unrepresented minority interest s in the state , and undue interference with interstate competition.308 304. The Court has been suspicious of tax credits that only apply to companies that produce their goods in the state, see New Energy Co. of Ind . v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278 (1988), and state laws that require producers to perform functions like processing and inspections in the state prior to exporting their products because they depri ve out -of-state processors or inspectors of the \"local demand for their services.\" See, e.g. , Pike, 397 U.S. at 142 (striking down Arizona statute that required all Arizona -grown cantalo upes to be packaged within the s tate prior to export). See also Dwyer , supra note 28 2, at 207 -08, nn.26 -30. This suggests state patents requiring that R&D or production related to the patented invention to occur in the state would be suspect as well.

See Gillette, supra note 7, at 450, 493 (stating that one general purpose of the Commerce Clause is to prevent discrimination against out of state interests and discrimination against politically powerless interstate interests based on protectionist polici es); Dwyer, supra note 28 2, at 220 -21 (citing Supreme Court discussion of the built -in protection in -state groups with political power have against state monopolization). 544 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 1. Putative Local Benefits First, to determine the strength of the state's interest in granting the patent, courts should consider whether the state rationally believes the patent is likely to ensure introduction of a useful innovation that leads to specific local benefits. These local b enefits might include solving a local problem, a new use for state resources, or environmental conservation. In making this assessment, courts should be wary of post hoc state patents granted for innovations already available in the state or easily purch ased in interstate commerce.309 For example, in Bonito , Florida granted \"patent -like\" protection for a type of boat hull that was not only in the public domain but was already manufactured and sold in the state.310 This type of protection may indicate that t he decision to grant the patent resulted from rent -seeking and lobbying by favored local industries, rather than a legitimate desire to foster more investment in local innovation.311 But courts should not necessarily strike down individual patents simply bec ause they are granted after -the-fact. Such laws may be designed to reward development costs and thereby create ex ante incentives to innovate in the future.312 Courts should simply scrutinize the record for signs of lobbying or corruption; if those signs are absent, then courts must infer that the state law was intended to promote the local interest indicated. In Bonito , the Court found that \"[t]he sparse legisl ative history surrounding its enactment indicates that [the Florida law] was intended to create an inducement for the improvement of boat hull designs.\"313 This inducement should have been sufficient to indicate a putative local benefit existed. As explain ed 309. See Merges & Reynolds, supra note 1 19, at 59 (suggesting that post -hoc rewards are less likely to encourage taking innovation risks \"on the front end\" and may be the result of \"legislative whim or influence\"). 310.

Coenen suggests that when applying dormant Commerce Clause doctrine courts take into account the political process under which the patent was granted and are wary of rent -seeking. Coenen, supra note 12 1, at 1031 -35; Daniel T. Coenen, Where United Haulers Takes Us , 95 IOWA L. REV. 541, 557 -58 (2010) [hereinafter Coenen, United Haulers ]. 312. See supra note 15, at 719 -23 (arguing the Bonito law created an efficient innovation incentive by rewarding the cost and risk involved in undertaking the development of better boat hulls). 313. Bonito , 489 U.S. at 158 (citing Fla. H.R. Meeting of Transp. Comm. Tr. (May 3, 1983), reprinted at App. 22 (com menting that \"there is no inducement for [a] quality boat manufacturer to improve these designs and secondly, if he does, it is immediately copied. This would prevent that, and allow him recourse in circuit court\")). 2013] STATE PATENTS 545 in Part V.C., the Court should not have attempted to evaluate the efficiency of the state law.314 2. Burden o n Interstate Commerce Second, the court must determine the burden that the state patent places on interstate commerce. Assuming the state patent does not overtly disfavor out -of-state interests , the primary consideration for this factor should be whether the patent inhibits competition from out -of-state entities.315 If the patent affects out -of-state competitors disproportionately, then the court sh ould be more likely to strike it down. For example, in Bonito , Florida's \"patent like right\" had a direct imp act on a Tennessee corporation, which was prevented from selling boat hulls made using plug mold s in Florida, while boat hull manufacturers in Florida benefitted.316 Assuming that the law did not also harm in -state sellers of boat hulls using plug molds , this result should have been a sign that this might be a \"beggar -thy-neighbor \" patent for a preferred local industry rather than a true innovation i ncentive. This may have been what the Court found , though the court did not sufficiently address the record on this point .317 On the other hand , the fact that a state patent affects only local competition and produces no discernible negative effects on out -of-state companies should not create a safe harbor.318 If the patent's scope is so open -ended that it effectively creates a monopoly in a defined local industry then this patent should be far more vulnerable to dormant Commerce Clau se preemption . For example, in C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown , the Supreme Court addressed the viability of a \"forced use\" rule mandating purchase of all waste -transfer services from a single, private319 contractor 314. Wiley , supra note 20 6, at 302. 315. See S.C. State Highway Dep't v. Barnwell Bros., 303 U .S. 177, 184 n.2 (1938) (stating that state regulations that provide an advantage for those in -state and burden those out -of-state have been thought to be unconstitutional). 316. Bonito , 489 U.S. at 1 45. 317. See id. at 163 (stating the lack of uniform federal law on intellectual property would allow states to provide patent -like protection to favored state industries). 318. See Larsen, supra note 30 1, at 852 (explaining view that a regulation is discr iminatory if the regulation imposes greater economic burdens on those outside the state than those within). 319. A six -member majority of the Court refused to extend the principle of Carbone to a law that required citizens to purchase services from a government -owned facility, holding that the dormant Commerce Clause does not prevent states from granting exclusive rights to state -run utilities companies, so long as the government treats all private competitors alike. United Haulers 546 KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 62 and authorizing the contract or to charge tipping fees that exceeded the rates of both in -state and out -of-state competitors.320 Similar to a state patent, one of the main purposes of the forced -use rule in Carbone was to allow the town to avoid paying a large, up -front sum (about $1.4 million) in order to have the contractor construct the facility on behalf of the town. Instead, the town effectively granted the contractor an exclusive right as an alternative form of incentive to supply a costly local good.321 As an illustration, imagine if the Clarkstown law were considered to be a \"patent\" instead of a \"forced use \" rule. The patent would be highly vulnerable to being struck down because it eliminated nearly all competition in the market for local waste -transfer services, whether in - state or out -of-state.322 But imagine instead that the law granted a patent not to a supplier of trash collection services but to the local developer of a new and untes ted \"plasma gasification\" trash disposal system.323 In- state and out -of-state businesses alik e would be free to collect trash in the state so long as they did so by non -infringing means. The burden on interstate commerce would not be nearly as great and \u2014assuming the patent also produces a viable local benefit ( i.e. a new and improved method of trash collection) \u2014the law should be upheld as a legitimate innovation incentive . 3. Less Restrictive Alternatives The final factor courts should consider is whether the state rationally believed a state patent, versus some other form of incentive, such as a direct payment or a loan, was the best way to encourage successful local working of the innovation.324 The primary issue to consider in this factor Ass'n v. Oneida -Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 550 U.S. 330, 342 (2007). State patents would typically be granted to private entities, not state -owned enterprises, so the exception for state -owned companies in United Haulers would not on its face apply to most state pate nts. 320.

See Carbone , 511 U.S. at 393 -94 (rejecting Clarkstown's argument that special financing was necessary because Clarkstown could have subsidized the facility through taxes or bonds). As the Sixth Circuit stated in striking down Ohio's tax credit scheme in Cuno , a state tax provision that is found to burden interstate commerce must advance \"a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives .\" Cu no v. Daimler -Chrysler, Inc., 2013] STATE PATENTS 547 is the level of technological and market uncertainty entailed in gene rating and successfully developing the innovation. A high level of uncertainty would indicate that a patent is a potentially more efficient way to \"pay\" for development than a cash incentive.325 On the other hand, a low level of uncertainty and, even more so, a known price would indicate that a non-patent financing measure would work just as well or better than direct payment. For example, in Carbone , the Court questioned why the town did not simply use taxes or issue municipal bonds to finance constructio n of the waste -transfer facility when the $1.4 million price had already been determined.326 In contrast, in the \"plasma gasification\" hypothetical, calculating how much the innovator would require both to recoup costs and also to make a sufficient profit t o justify the risk would be much more difficult.327 The town would have a stronger justification for granting a patent for the disposal system. VI. CONCLUSION The Supreme Court's current preemption doctrine effectively eliminates states' authority to grant \"patent -like\" rights.328 But this Article shows that state patents could provide states with a valuable alternative to non-patent incentives such as R&D tax credits for promoting innovation and economic development in their jurisdictions. On the national level, state patents could supplement the U.S. patent system's framework of incentives by providing protection for unpatentable innovations or patent able inventions tha t are difficult to commercialize. States could also generate stores of valuable information about the effect of patents in the marketplace and improve the quality of patent law by introducing and testing law and policy innovations.329 To the extent that judicial review is necessary to limit the costs state patents 386 F.3d 738, 743 (2004) (quoting New Energy Co. of Ind. v.
