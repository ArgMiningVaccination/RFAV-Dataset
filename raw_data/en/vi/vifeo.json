But what about the toxins we don't knowingly ingest or absorb? Do you drink unfiltered water, or beverages with artificial sweeteners? Do you cook with Teflon, plastic utensils, aluminum cookware, or reheat foods in the microwave using plastic containers? Does your home or workplace contain conventional cleaning chemicals or toxic substances, new construction materials, or show signs of mold or water damage? Do you consume processed foods (i.e., foods with added artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, or sweeteners), deep-fried, or fast foods? Do you eat conventionally-grown (non-organic) or genetically- modified fruits and vegetables, eggs, animal proteins, and farmed fish? Do you smoke, exposed to second-hand smoke, or have a history of heavy use of alcohol, recreational, or prescription drugs? Do you have root canals, extracted teeth, \"silver\" fillings, crowns, dental sealants, dentures, retainers, aligning trays, braces, mouth guards, dental implants, etc.? Toxins Are Everywhere We simply cannot escape the 80,000 plus pollutants, household and personal care products, chemicals, plastics, mold, heavy metals, pesticides, contaminated water, and more in our everyday living environment. Things that can increase toxicity in your body: - Alcohol (obviously the #1 answer according to what people are asking every month) - Smoking - Prescription and OTC drugs - Infections/illness - Stress - Processed food - Non-organic food/glyphosate - Environmental toxins, chemicals, and heavy metals - Nutrient deficiencies and a poor diet - Allergies/food intolerances - Genetic variances negatively affecting liver detoxification pathways Toxins Accumulate In Your Body We also have toxic buildup inside our bodies from things like normal metabolic processes, hidden infections and inflammation. Detoxing Obviously Makes Sense Now you know a little bit about how your body gets toxins, intentional or inadvertently. And like many of the people asking the same questions every month, the next step seems to be obvious, detox to undo the damage. But there are a lot of detoxes out there. Where do you start? A Detox Can Mean Many Things - Temporarily abstaining from something harmful (like sugar or alcohol) - Consuming something beneficial (like green juice) - A combination of things that ultimately help our bodies eliminate substances detrimental to our health Regardless of the approach, the objective of a detox is to remove the bad stuff. This is A Naturopathic Physician's (Dr. Aieta, ND) Approach to Natural Detoxification To do this we need to support our body's natural detoxification organs so they function optimally. The liver, kidneys, digestive system, skin and lungs process and excrete toxins through our urine, feces, sweat, and breath on a daily basis. What do we actually need to do (and stop doing) to detox in a healthy, effective, and manageable way? Following an easy yet effective custom-formulated detox can get you started on the right path towards rebalancing your health and getting rid of ongoing symptoms. Over 20 years experience as an expert in herbal medicine As a CT-licensed naturopathic physician, nutritionist, and expert in herbal medicine for over twenty years, I have seen what works in clinical practice. My detox is designed to be a fool-proof method using a simple dietary, lifestyle and supplement plan to target the ways the body eliminates waste. This strategy gets quick results while teaching basic ways to relieve some of the most common health complaints for good (like weight gain). Dr. Aieta's Detox Program Overview Let's first discuss dietary changes that we can all gradually do to get back on track. Instead of jumping head first into a very strict diet plan that may be difficult to stick with, we can do it gradually in steps while taking some very specific natural supplements as an adjunct to the diet to help with overall metabolism and detoxification. We can break it down to weekly dietary changes and supplements that build upon the previous week as we work towards achieving or re-achieving optimal health with a gradual cleansing.

This means taking out bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, rice, corn, cookies, and cakes etc. Don't worry about tracking your carbs or calories just focus on being 100% grain free and try to just eat when your are hungry and limit between meal snacking. When you are ready move on to step 2 Detox Protocol [Week 2:](#week2) Continue to avoid the grain products as well as foods with added sugar. Now it's time to start being more aware of how much fat you are ingesting daily in contrast to your protein. Most people forget this crucial step of adding more fat in. It's easy to cut carbs and immediately start eating tons of protein and forget about the need for dietary fat. In order to get into ketosis, it's important to eat higher fat (70% or more of your daily calories) moderate protein (around 20-25%) and low carb (around 7% or less). Detox Protocol [Week 3:](#week3) Start checking for the presence of ketones either through urine (convenient, cheap but least accurate), breath (more expensive, very convenient, more accurate than urine), or blood (most expensive due to the cost of the test strips, most accurate, least convenient). Based upon your ketone status you can adjust your diet accordingly.....maybe less carbs, less protein and more fat. Detox Protocol [Week 4:](#week4) Once you are in ketosis your appetite should be greatly diminished so you should start trying some intermittent fasting. Essentially only eat when you are hungry and try eating within a 6-8 hour window. Detox Protocol [Week 5 and on-going: ](#week5) if you hit a plateau - pick one day a week as a designated overfeed day where you may exercise more and increase your fat and protein intake but keep your carbs low (less than 20-30 Net Carbs). This will recharge your metabolism. [NEW!
