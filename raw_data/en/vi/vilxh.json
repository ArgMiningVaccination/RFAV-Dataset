It is characterized by poor attention span, impulsive behaviors, and hyperactivity in some children. The diagnostic criteria are strictly observational, and there are no objective laboratory tests to confirm that diagnosis. Subjective evaluations of annoying, distracting, or inattentive behavior makes the \"diagnosis\" of ADD/ADHD speculative at best. The most common medical \"treatment\" for this controversial \"disease\" is prescriptions of Methylphenidate (Ritalin), a Class II controlled and addictive substance. The long-term effects of this drug on children is unknown, but the side-effects, including addiction, are becoming better understood. What is ADD/ADHD? Although it's exact \"cause\" is unknown, major etiologic contributors include adverse responses to food additives, intolerances to foods, sensitivities to environmental chemicals, molds, and fungi, and exposures to neurodevelopmental toxins, such as heavy metals and organohalide pollutants. [ [1](../pediatrics/ABSTRACTS/ADD_Rationale.shtml)] Nutrient deficiencies are common in ADD/ADHD. Supplementation with minerals, B vitamin complex, flavonoids, and the omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids have shown promising results, as are reported in the [Abstracts Section](#Abstracts) section below. A wholistic/integrative management program will include supplementation, dietary modification, detoxification, and removal of environmental toxins and toxic cleaners from the home. This page is devoted to sharing research information about ADD/ADHD to help parents and teachers make informed decisions, and to support the children who stand to benefit from a drug-free existance. The following articles and journal abstracts discuss ADD/ADHD and a \"natural treatment\" program.

Dysfunctional oculomotor control may result in reading or educational difficulties. This randomized controlled crossover study sought to investigate the feasibility of a larger scale trial and effects of a single session of spinal manipulation on oculomotor control in children with ADHD. Thirty children participated in the study and were randomized into either control-first or spinal manipulation first groups. The results indicate that the trial was feasible. Secondary outcomes showed that there was a significant decrease in reading time after the spinal manipulation intervention compared to the control intervention. Future studies of the effects of spinal manipulation on oculomotor control in children with ADHD are suggested. | || |[ ] [ A Possible Link Between Early Probiotic Intervention](../pediatrics/ABSTRACTS/A_Possible_Link_Between_Early.shtml) and the Risk of Neuropsychiatric Disorders Later in Childhood: A Randomized Trial Pediatr Res. 2015 (Jun); 77 (6): 823-828 At the age of 13 y, ADHD or AS was diagnosed in 6/35 (17.1%) children in the placebo and none in the probiotic group (P = 0.008). Probiotic supplementation early in life may reduce the risk of neuropsychiatric disorder development later in childhood possible by mechanisms not limited to gut microbiota composition. | || |[ ] [ Complementary and Alternative Medical Therapies](../pediatrics/ABSTRACTS/CAM_for_Children.shtml) for Children With Attention-deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Alternative Medicine Review 2011 (Dec); 16 (4): 323-337 ~ FULL TEXT Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a commonly diagnosed childhood disorder characterized by impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity. ADHD affects up to 1 in 20 children in the United States. The underlying etiologies of ADHD may be heterogeneous and diverse, and many possible risk factors in the development of ADHD have been identified. Conventional treatment usually consists of behavioral accommodations and medication, with stimulant medication most commonly being prescribed. Parents concerned about the side effects and long-term use of conventional medications are increasingly seeking alternatives to pharmacologic treatment. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) offers parents various treatment options for this condition, including dietary modifications, nutritional supplementation, herbal medicine, and homeopathy. | || |[ ] [ Chiropractic Care for Pediatric and Adolescent](../pediatrics/ABSTRACTS/Chiropractic_Care_for_Pediatric_and_Adolescent.shtml) Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review Chiropractic & Osteopathy 2010 (Jun 2); 18: 13 ~ FULL TEXT The search yielded 58 citations of which 22 were intervention studies. Of these, only three studies were identified for pediatric and adolescent AD/HD cohorts. The methodological quality was poor and none of the studies qualified using inclusion criteria. To date there is insufficient evidence to evaluate the efficacy of chiropractic care for pediatric and adolescent AD/HD. The claim that chiropractic care improves pediatric and adolescent AD/HD, is only supported by low levels of scientific evidence. In the interest of pediatric and adolescent health, if chiropractic care for AD/HD is to continue, more rigorous scientific research needs to be undertaken to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of chiropractic treatment. Adequately-sized RCTs using clinically relevant outcomes and standardised measures to examine the effectiveness of chiropractic care verses no-treatment/placebo control or standard care (pharmacological and psychosocial care) are needed to determine whether chiropractic care is an effective alternative intervention for pediatric and adolescent AD/HD. | || |[ ] [ Some Food Additives Raise Hyperactivity, Study Finds](../pediatrics/ABSTRACTS/Some_Food_Additives_Raise_Hyperactivity.shtml) New York Times Research Section (Sep 6, 2007) Common food additives and colorings can increase hyperactive behavior in a broad range of children, a study being released today found. It was the first time researchers conclusively and scientifically confirmed a link that had long been suspected by many parents. Numerous support groups for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have for years recommended removing such ingredients from diets, although experts have continued to debate the evidence. But this new, [carefully controlled study in The Lancet Journal](../pediatrics/ABSTRACTS/Food_Additives_and_Hyperactive_Behaviour.shtml) shows that some artificial additives increase hyperactivity and decrease attention span in a wide range of children, not just those for whom overactivity has been diagnosed as a learning problem. | || |[ ] [ ADHD, Ritalin, and Big Brother](../pediatrics/ABSTRACTS/Big_Brother.shtml) Alternative Medicine Review 2000 (Oct); 5 (5): 401 ~ FULL TEXT The year: 2000. Location: somewhere in the United States. \"Doug and Marie,\" loving, well-intentioned parents of a school-aged child are sitting in a jail cell, awaiting a hearing in which they will be charged with child abuse and neglect. The reason? Refusing to dose their son with Ritalin. This scenario is fictitious; however, it is not far from what could happen. | || |[ ] [ Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)](../pediatrics/ABSTRACTS/ADD_Rationale.shtml) in Children: Rationale for Its Integrative Management Alternative Medicine Review 2000 (Oct); 5 (5): 402-428 ~ FULL TEXT ADHD begins in childhood and often persists into adulthood. The exact etiology is unknown; genetics plays a role, but major etiologic contributors also include adverse responses to food additives, intolerances to foods, sensitivities to environmental chemicals, molds, and fungi, and exposures to neurodevelopmental toxins such as heavy metals and organohalide pollutants. Mounting controversy over the widespread use of methylphenidate and possible life-threatening effects from its long-term use make it imperative that alternative modalities be implemented for ADHD management. Nutrient deficiencies are common in ADHD; supplementation with minerals, the B vitamins (added in singly), omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids, flavonoids, and the essential phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) can ameliorate ADHD symptoms. When individually managed with supplementation, dietary modification, detoxification, correction of intestinal dysbiosis, and other features of a wholistic/integrative program of management, the ADHD subject can lead a normal and productive life. | || |[ ] [ Polyunsaturated Fats and Neurological Disorders](../Graphics_Box_NUTRITION/FULL/Polyunsaturated_Fats_and_Neurological_Disorders.shtml) Nutrition Science News (Sep 2000) For he past 50 years, major psychiatric disorders generally have been attributed to neurotransmitter system abnormalities. Neurotransmitters are biochemicals that transfer information from one neuron, or central nervous system cell, to another. While this concept is still considered valid, it has limited ability to explain the origins and guide the treatment of mental illness. Furthermore, there is a growing consensus in scientific circles that the phospholipid metabolism of the neuron cells themselves also plays a crucial role in the development of mental conditions. [1] Phospholipids are substances composed of two fatty acids linked to a phosphate group (e.g. choline, serine, inositol). This consensus has come because numerous studies have linked low brain levels of these substances to conditions such as depression, dyslexia, schizophrenia and more. | || |[ ] [ ADHD: A Modern Malady](../Graphics_Box_NUTRITION/FULL/ADHD_A_Modern_Malady.shtml) Nutrition Science News (August 2000) ADHD is being identified as epidemic throughout the United States: The National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., estimates that from 3 to 5 percent of all American schoolchildren have been diagnosed with the disorder. This trend alone is reason for concern, but perhaps more troubling is that more than 6 million American children currently diagnosed with ADHD are being treated with central nervous system stimulants--usually methylphenidate (Ritalin)--when more natural approaches exist. [1] A sad commentary on the seriousness of this problem was related by a patient who recently visited his child's school and outside the nurse's office found a long line of children waiting to get their dose of Ritalin. | || |[ ] [ Diet, ADHD & Behavior:](../Graphics_Box_PEDS/FULL/Report_On_Diet_And_Behavior.pdf) A Quarter-Century Review Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) (Oct 25, 1999) This report reviews 23 controlled studies of the effect of food dyes and other dietary constituents on the behavior of children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or other behavioral problems. Though the studies are limited due to the number of subjects, extent of dietary changes tested, assessment techniques, and other factors, 17 of the 23 studies found evidence that some children's behavior significantly worsens after they consume artificial colors or certain foods, such as milk or wheat. Limited research with such tools as electroencephalography (EEG) indicates that certain foods trigger physiological changes in sensitive individuals.

A growing body of evidence implicates diet in the commonly diagnosed attention deficit disorder (ADD). Simple meal modification may eliminate the need for the frightening array of drugs being prescribed to control children. Diet can mean the difference between a normal childhood and years of difficult behavior or behavior-modifying drugs. | || | [ ] [ Stress-Reducing Fatty Acids](../Graphics_Box_NUTRITION/FULL/Stress_Reducing_Fatty_Acids.shtml) Also May Defuse Health Risks Nutrition Science News (May 1997) More than half of all patients who visit general physicians suffer from symptoms triggered or made worse by stress -- headaches, ulcers, fatigue or even emotional distress. Two research studies demonstrated that essential fatty acid nutritional supplements can increase resistance to stress--and its debilitating and costly side effects. | || |[ ] [ Top Child Health Agencies Urge Testing to Protect](../pediatrics/ABSTRACTS/Toxins.shtml) Early Brain Development From Toxins: One Out of Six Affected Learning Disability Association of America One out of six children are suffering from behavioral disorder according to the Learning Disabilities Association and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS-NIU).
