Not flu,\" (Edgenuity). Using the association technique, it shows how of the two things mentioned, popcorn and the flu, popcorn is the item that should be shared, rather than the much sicklier alternative. This is enforced with the ad's informative message of, \"Even healthy kids of any age can get sick from the flu, and they can spread it to family, friends, and others. Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every year,\" (Edgenuity). This successfully gets across that the flu is a serious illness that should not be spread, but that it is easily preventable with a flu vaccination. Parents may see this ad and worry about their child's safety; not only could their child get the flu, they could spread it to other children as well. Many parents may then go get a flu shot for their children in order to prevent that from happening. This ad effectively uses the association technique and spreads the important message in an informative and catchy way. The Centers for Disease Control is advertising a campaign that is trying to persuade people to get the flu vaccination shot for themselves and their children. It will be told what techniques they are using to persuade these people to get the shot. Mandatory Influenza Vaccinations for healthcare providers can be a controversial topic for some and may propose a challenge to some provider's ethical values and beliefs. The topic of mandatory vaccination for influenza (\"flu\") has been widely studied and debated among professionals over several years. It is apparent that there is some movement towards a mandatory vaccination for influenza by healthcare institutions as the benefit out weighs the risk on several fronts. \"Influenza infection is associated with 36,000 excess deaths and > 200,000 hospitalizations in the United States annually. It is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death in the United States every year\" (Babcock, Geminhart, Jones, Dunagan, & Woeltje, 2010, p. 459). Every year, millions of people start talking about the influenza virus and getting their vaccines as the flu season approaches, which starts around the October-November period and reaches its peak between December and March. Therefore, public health officials around the world- and in the U.S in particular- are constantly challenged Also, there is no violation of the right to make contracts between employer and employee by making influenza vaccinations mandatory for healthcare workers. The article \"Vaccinating the Health-Care Workforce\" states, \"Courts have ruled that states may also limit and regulate contracts in the interest of the public's welfare, and essentially to place protection of the public against individual economic interest\" (Stewart). Healthcare facilities do not violate their worker's rights by making influenza immunizations mandatory as long as it benefits the public health. Health care governments have endorsed an assortment of vaccination policies and mediations to safeguard against the known dangers of influenza communication, with longer patient stays, absenteeism, intermissions in health care, and death. Studies assessing the consequence of health care workers vaccination found that health care workers influenza vaccination was linked with a decrease in patient death (Murana, 2014). Assessing the results of health care worker influenza vaccination on patient results anticipated that if all health care workers were vaccinated, patient influenza infections could be stopped. With influenza vaccination rates remaining low in the HCP population, there has recently been an increased emphasis on improving vaccination rates among HCPs. Low influenza vaccination rates have caused many healthcare facilities to initiate and mandate employees to receive the influenza vaccine. Research has proven to reduce morbidity and mortality among patients in healthcare facilities as well as decrease illness and absenteeism among HCPs (Sickbert & Weber, 2013). For these reasons multiple professional organizations are recommending an annual influenza vaccine for all HCPs, if medically suitable for this vaccination. Requiring a physician waiver for non-suitable HCP, all non-suitable HCP are expected or required to wear a mask in direct patient care areas. For the past ten years, we at Virginia Mason Medical Center have been implementing mandatory influenza vaccination. This is due to the flu vaccination being able to reduce flu illnesses and prevent flu-related hospitalizations. According to the Center for Control and Disease (CDC, 2014) during 2012-2013, an estimated 45% of the U.S population got vaccinated, helping to prevent an estimated 6.6 million flu-related illness, with 3.2 million flu-related medical visits, almost 80,000 hospitalizations and roughly $87 billion dollars in total economic burden. Influenza is extremely contagious and each year on an average 5%-20% of the U.S population get the flu with tens of thousands die from a flu-related illness. Therefore, many health cares setting along with Virginia Mason Medical Center is mandating all their healthcare workers to get the influenza vaccination. Consequently, making annual influenza vaccination requirement for healthcare workers a continuing and debatable health topic. The potential of getting the vaccination have great benefits to healthcare professionals, their patients, and their families by The influenza vaccination in not only beneficial to recipients but also those that come in contact with the individuals exposed to or at risk for contracting influenza. Health care workers are at a constant risk of exposure to various diseases and illness including influenza. An emergency such as a vaccination shortage for influenza will not only affect at risk individuals but spread rapidly to all those exposed without knowledge or a-symptomatic at time of encounter. Health care workers will be exposed in physician offices, hospitals, emergency care or urgent care centers with heightened possibility of spreading the illness (CDC, 2015). Health care workers are not limited to the obvious: physicians or nurses but also, therapists, EMS, Betty, Great ideas on finding a solution that can increase the rate of vaccination for the older population. Having a strong community that offers different programs to help different ethnicity is a good solution for them to have a good quality health care. With the community, there can be an outreach that can collaborate with the community partners and health care providers to educate, motive, and promote seasonal influenza vaccination (AHIP, 2011). With many minority populations (Hispanic, Asian, etc) believed that vaccination can cause more serious illness, there should be an agency that can address those misconceptions and educate them risk and safety of vaccination (AHIP, 2011). The local pharmacies and supermarkets are also a good way In 2012, British Colombia became the first jurisdiction in Canada to institute a mandatory policy, that requires health-care workers (HCW) in the province to either get the flu vaccine each year, or wear masks; while caring for patients during the flu season, and it lasted approximately four months [1]. Under this policy, anyone who does not abide by it will face discipline actions or even possible termination. Since then, there have been intensive debates around this policy. The supporting argument lies in the issues of HCW protection and the public's expectation that acts on the best interests of patients. The purpose is to promote employee productivity by preventing employees from getting flu and passing virus to patients when providing care. The Canadian Nurses Association declares that \"It is CNA's position that all Annually there are a number of children who contract the influenza during the influenza season that results in an increase in costs in pediatric office visits and antibiotic and other medications consumption and also in a significant increase in absences from school and work. Thus influenza vaccination of children can help reduce the number of visit to pediatric office, hospitalizations, and help prevent the spread of influenza in the wider community. Moreover vaccinating children is cost effective when considering all the cost of treatment for influenza and its complications. Therefore yearly vaccination of children with the inactivated influenza vaccine save parent money and time away from the pediatric clinic. Influenza vaccine does not Vaccines have allowed humans to avoid contracting terrible diseases for over 200 years now, but are these same vaccines that are meant to help actually hurting us? Influenza kills more people in the United States than any other vaccine-preventable disease (Immunization Partnership), 1.5 million children die from vaccine-preventable diseases every year (Children's Hospital) and 3,000 to 6,000 people develop Guillain Barre Syndrome each year on average (CDC). There are billions of people in this world who need to be protected from everyday viruses. Scientists have come up with a way to avoid contracting many diseases, but many of these vaccines lead to more problems that threaten our health. Scientists and doctors need to ensure that enough is being done to prevent vaccinations from causing unintended health issues. Influenza is an infectious illness that can be spread from one individual to the next. It can be transmitted by means of saliva, nasal secretions, feces and blood. It can also be spread by coming in contact with the virus on contaminated surfaces. Influenza is responsible for an average of 36,000 deaths and for more than 226,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States. (Davidson, 2007-2009, Davis, 2007). Illnesses have long haunted the human race. As long as these illnesses have existed, humans have developed ways to cure themselves, beginning with simple herbs and proceeding as far as vaccines and complex medicines. One cure that long eluded scientists was that of the influenza virus. Now, the influenza vaccine, or flu shot, saves thousands of lives a year and helps prevent serious complications resulting from influenza infection. "}
