CHRONIC ILLNESS Chronic illness covers a wide variety of issues such as autoimmune diseases, digestive disorders and chronic fatigue. While you may be frustrated with the lack of results in treating these issues, we've helped many of our patients find relief by treating the root causes of these issues. SIBO, Arthritis, Asthma, Lyme and Hashimotos are just some of the chronic illnesses we specialize in. PAIN We treat all types of pain - joint, spinal, back, headaches, neck, muscle, nerve, etc. We've been able to help with issues such as Migraines as well. HORMONE IMBALANCES Hormone therapy and hormone balancing treatments are common services for our office. As women age they may see a decrease in production by their bodies of estrogen and progesterone due to menopause, but both men and women can need hormone therapy and balancing treatments. Our bodies are a system balanced by hormones. Bioidentical hormones, hormone precursors, and nutrition are only a few of the ways the body can get back on the right track. GUT HEALTH Many of the most pressing health issues can be traced to our gut. Our gut can be fixed and repaired with the right attention and care to provide greater comfort and overall health. NATURAL HEALTH Integrative health care treats the patient as a whole being. Care is individualized and utilizes the best of multiple avenues of treatment. Traditional medicine has given us many tools and medications save lives, but they are not always the only treatment options. Natural and integrative medicine combines the best of multiple disciplines of healing to bring about true health and wellbeing. MENTAL HEALTH Depressive disorder, frequently referred to simply as depression, is more than just feeling sad or going through a rough patch. It's a serious mental health condition that requires understanding and medical care. Left untreated, depression can be devastating for those who have it and their families. Fortunately, with early detection, diagnosis and a treatment plan consisting of medication, psychotherapy and healthy lifestyle choices, many people can and do get better. ALLERGIES We can help test for over 70 of the most common allergies that you may not even be aware you have. We can test for food allergies. We also offer immunotherapy and it is often covered by insurances. NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS Neurological disorders are diseases of the brain, spine and the nerves that connect them. There are more than 600 diseases of the nervous system, including headaches, cognitive decline, Alzheimer's, Neuropathy and much more. ADRENAL ISSUES Your adrenal glands produce and regulate DHEA and Cortisol hormones which are essential for day to day functioning of your body. The adrenal glands communicate with the brain to balance the endocrine system. Todays world of constant chronic stress and illness puts overwhelming pressure on the adrenal glands often leading to disfunction and severe fatigue. WEIGHT LOSS While we are not a diet and weight loss clinic, we do understand that weight control is influenced by so much more than diet and exercise. We have seen so many women struggling to live on 1000 calories a day, working out several hours a day and still not loosing weight. Fat stores are essential for the body to survive and it will protect them fiercely if the body is not properly balanced. While diet and exercise play a critical role in weight management, we also have to look at hormone balance, thyroid function, inflammation, sleep, stress, genetics, medications, disease processes, infections, and plastic and chemical exposure (particularly in our food and water).
