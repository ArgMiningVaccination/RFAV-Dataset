In the United States, there are currently 3 FDA approved COVID-19 vaccines available under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).* The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how federal partners are working together to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. The Western States Scientific Safety Review Workgroup will also review vaccines before they become available in California. The report on the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is available here Vaccination is a safe and effective way to prevent disease. Vaccines save millions of lives each year. When we get vaccinated, we aren't just protecting ourselves, but we are also protecting those around us. All individuals 12 years and older are eligible for the vaccine. Vaccines are given at primary care clinics, urgent care centers, hospitals, pharmacies, some workplaces, and special vaccination sites run by Monterey County Health Department or by other county, city, community, and health care partners. If you registered for an appointment online, please bring a copy of of your appointment confirmation or be able to access it at the clinic on a mobile device. It should show the date, time, and location of your appointment. Please also bring an identification card, if you have one. COVID-19 vaccine is being given to all Monterey County residents regardless of immigration status. You should not be asked about your immigration status. Bring your vaccination card with you to your second shot appointment so your provider can fill in the information about your second dose. Keep your vaccination card in case you need it for future use. Consider taking a picture of your vaccination card after your second shot appointment as a backup copy. For California Residents: Go to California's Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record portal. Just enter a few details in the portal https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/ to get a link to a QR code and digital copy of your COVID-19 vaccination record.

The portal provides only a digital copy of your vaccine record. If you have any more questions about your Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record, visit the FAQ page https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/faq If you enrolled in v-safe or VaxText after your first vaccine dose, you can access your vaccination information using those tools.

They can provide assistance with scheduling an appointment or giving you information about walk-in vaccination clinics. If you receive a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, you will need 2 shots to get the most protection. COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable. If you received a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, you should get the same product for your second shot. You should get your second shot even if you have side effects after the first shot, unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get it. If you need help finding a second dose clinic, please call 2-1-1. The timing between your first and second shots depends on which vaccine you received. If you received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, you should get your second shot at least 3 weeks (or 21 days) after your first. If you received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, you should get your second shot at least 4 weeks (or 28 days) after your first. You should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 4-week interval as possible. However, your second dose may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose, if necessary. You should not get the second dose early. There is currently limited information on the effectiveness of receiving your second shot earlier than recommended or later than 6 weeks after the first shot. If you do receive your second shot of COVID-19 vaccine later than recommended, you do not have to restart the vaccine series. People are considered fully vaccinated: 2 weeks after their second shot in a 2-dose series, like the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or 2 weeks after a single-shot vaccine, like Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine You are not fully vaccinated if: it has been less than 2 weeks since your 1-dose shot it has been less than 2 weeks since your second shot of a 2-dose vaccine you still need to get your second dose of a 2-dose vaccine After you are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. Learn more about what you can do when you have been fully vaccinated. The following are acceptable as proof of full vaccination: Vaccination card (which includes the name of the person vaccinated, type of vaccine provided, and date the last dose administered) OR a photo of a vaccination card as a separate document OR a photo of the attendee's vaccine card stored on a phone or electronic device OR documentation of vaccination from a healthcare provider. Cost will not be an obstacle to getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Federal, state and local governments are committed to providing free or low-cost COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine doses purchased with tax dollars will be given no cost. However, private vaccine providers will be able to charge administration fees for giving or administering the shot to someone. Most public and private insurance companies will cover that fee so there is no cost for the person getting vaccinated. In addition, people without health insurance will get COVID-19 vaccines at no cost. You cannot be denied the COVID-19 because you cannot afford the vaccine administration fee a provider may be charging. At the community clinics sponsored by Monterey County Health Department's Public Health Bureau, insurance information will not be collected and no administrative fee will be charged. People with healthy immune systems are recommended to get 2 doses of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or 1 dose of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine as their primary vaccination series. People who have weak immune systems need an extra dose of Pfizer or Moderna to get the same protection as people with healthy immune systems get in 2 doses. The extra dose as part of the recommended vaccination series for people with weakened immune systems is what is being called a \"third dose.\" The effect of most vaccinations decrease over time. With the COVID-19 vaccine, early data suggest that this may start to occur around 6 months after the 2nd dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine and 2 months after the 1st dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Experts recommend a \"booster\" for some groups of people, particularly those 60 years and older, to help keep levels of protection high.
