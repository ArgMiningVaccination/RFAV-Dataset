Introduction [Mackay 1999](#B26-religions-13-00563)). Although the emergence of literary tradition made a significant contribution to the explosion of information (cf. [Toffler 1970](#B46-religions-13-00563)), it did not fully replace the oral tradition. The two traditions have coexisted, assuming complementary roles in the process of transmitting knowledge and connecting individuals and communities across generations and geographic regions. As Foley posits: Indeed, if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything, it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive, preliminary techno logy of communication we thought it to be. Rather, if the whole truth is told, oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and, in many areas still, a contemporary reality. [Oral Tradition n.d.](#B36-religions-13-00563)). It is the \"stories, beliefs, etc., that a group of people share by telling stories and talking to each other\" ( [Merriam-Webster n.d.](#B30-religions-13-00563)). In the pre-modern African context, the oral tradition found expression through multiple media, including proverbs, songs, stories, customary laws, and language (cf. [Merrie 2019](#B31-religions-13-00563)). Storytelling seems to have emerged as one of the most organic and natural expressions, permeating all the other methods. Individuals engaged in storytelling/listening to connect, inform, admonish, educate even challenge each other as necessary. One unique aspect of storytelling was its therapeutic function peculiar within the African worldview. I have often borrowed from this therapeutic function of the African oral tradition as a bridge in the delivery of spiritual care in the contemporary health context. My interest grew from years of work with patients in a residential treatment facility for older adults with physical and cognitive decline. I recalled scattered incidents of observing the practice within my community of origin and participating in the tradition intermittently during school holidays or reading about it in books. I then purposed to explore further, thus my ongoing attempts at self-discovery and a desire to share the knowledge. This approach can add value to therapeutic conversations with all populations and most particularly with older adults. Used as an agent of healing, storytelling and listening can enhance communication in spiritual conversations among older adults in therapeutic contexts. [Juma and Juma 2017](#B21-religions-13-00563)). Employing such a narrative language allows simplicity in [spiritual] dialogue through reflection on experiences rather than on abstract constructs (cf. [Kenyon and Randall 1999](#B23-religions-13-00563)). In the chapter \"the church and the streets: an ethnographic study of the Christian hip hop scene in central Texas\", Burnaby quotes Wilson (In [Schneider and Kotarba 2016, p. 155](#B41-religions-13-00563)) who writes, \"most African societies place great worth in oral tradition because it is a primary means of conveying culture\". It is also a mode of transmitting feelings and attitudes. Songs and music formed an integral part of the African oral tradition, which caused the two to be interrelated. Songs were employed to enhance certain aspects of the narrative and provide a rhythm for both the storyteller and the audience. Therapeutic storytelling is predominantly inherent in contexts where the sacred intertwines with the secular in all aspects of life. There are apparent similarities between this approach and the narrative approach in the contemporary therapeutic milieu. In this respect, a narrative approach is particularly suited to the exploration of such topics as meaning, spirituality, and wisdom and the connections they share ( [Bohlmeijer et al. 2011](#B6-religions-13-00563); [Kenyon and Randall 1999](#B23-religions-13-00563)). Storytelling was a cherished method of sharing knowledge, socializing communities, and promoting health and wellness in most of Sub-Saharan Africa ( [Finnegan 2003](#B15-religions-13-00563)). It would seem that storytelling, similar to some of the transgenerational and multigenerational approaches in family therapy, can be recaptured in therapeutic conversations with all generations, but mostly with the older populations. 2. The Value of Storytelling in Therapeutic Contexts with Older Adults [Mitty 2010](#B32-religions-13-00563)). Unless care practitioners develop ways to incorporate storytelling in their work with older adults, such stories remain buried in the memories of the clients, patients, and residents as they approach the final transition in life. Writing from the practitioner's perspective, [Bergner](#B3-religions-13-00563)( [2007](#B3-religions-13-00563)) outlines some beneficial features of using stories in psychotherapy, concluding his discussion with the statement, \"stories are powerful devices for assisting patients\" (p. 16). Practitioners can begin to shed light on those stories in their efforts to facilitate making meaning and foster healing in therapeutic settings. Although the broader oral traditions served humanity in the transmission of history, stories, folktales, and religious beliefs from generation to generation; therapeutic storytelling was a distinct intervention prevalent in Indigenous approaches to healing within diverse African communities (cf. [Juma 2015](#B22-religions-13-00563); [Akunna 2015](#B1-religions-13-00563)). However, with increased immigration and the process of regulating the helping profession in the contemporary context, some of the pre-modern approaches in therapy are likely to fade. Thus, the need to recapture relevant aspects of these traditions and weave them into the postmodern family therapy approaches. [Kerr et al.](#B24-religions-13-00563)( [2014](#B24-religions-13-00563)) wrote about the value of storytelling in the health context, illustrating her point in an article on \"Families, healing systems and journal\" She reflected on her experience stating: When I take my son to the doctor, we untangle the web of distortions provided by his birth parent in his younger years. We strive to make right the wrongs, to set his story straight. I'm grateful his new doctor knows the patient's story matters\u2014and that it matters who's telling the story, who's listening. [Moen](#B33-religions-13-00563)( [2006](#B33-religions-13-00563)) also concludes his discussion by stating, \"Thus, storytelling as a way of recounting and creating order out of experience starts in childhood and continues through all stages of our lives\" (p. 60). 2.1. The Art of Storytelling [Haigh and Hardy 2011](#B18-religions-13-00563)). The National Storytelling Network ( [NSN n.d.](#B34-religions-13-00563)) provides an elaborate description of the word storytelling, including the nature, method, and goal. The author acknowledges that the word \"storytelling is often used in many ways and give what is considered the understanding of the NSN in America. They present a basic understanding of storytelling \"as an ancient art form and a valuable form of human expression\" ( [https://storynet.org/what-is-storytelling/](https://storynet.org/what-is-storytelling/), Retrieved on 20 April 2022). Storytelling is a prevalent method of communication in various forms, including mainstream and social media. It is one of the most basic modes of communication and an integral part of being human. Through storytelling, people can find a deep connection as their stories weave into their separate lives, unveiling their common humanity. Storytelling can enable individuals' effortless and natural communication as people encounter each other. The pre-modern African communities relegated professional storytelling to older adults, who were known to be reservoirs of collective stories. Providentially, they were at a season in life that afforded them all the time needed to share those stories in various modes of communication. Storytelling seemed most efficient in transmitting knowledge, culture, and history to the young and emerging generation. In the contemporary context, practitioners need to be intentional and make time for the stories to evolve and serve their natural purpose-connecting people. Storytelling has the potential to serve as a medium that enables both narrator(s) and listener(s) to connect through shared stories. [Meretoja 2017](#B29-religions-13-00563); [Scott 2011](#B42-religions-13-00563); [Cronon 2013](#B9-religions-13-00563)). Individuals can learn and acquire storytelling skills and tools necessary to apply the method in research and practice. Writing from a business context, [Taylor](#B45-religions-13-00563)( [2021](#B45-religions-13-00563)) acknowledges the effect of storytelling on one's identity and challenges employers to encourage the culture of innovative storytelling among their employees. As a science, storytelling can be studied for clarity and consistency (cf. [Taylor 2021](#B45-religions-13-00563); [Cronon 2013](#B9-religions-13-00563); [Houston et al. 2011](#B19-religions-13-00563); [McBeth et al. 2005](#B28-religions-13-00563)). In his presidential address, the president of the American Historical Association, William [Cronon](#B9-religions-13-00563)( [2013](#B9-religions-13-00563)), posed this question to his audience, asking, \"What is the future of history?\" He situated this question with a comprehensive introduction to provide the context stating: \"In a distracted world where even undergraduates at top universities are increasingly challenged to read the kinds of books we have traditionally written, and at a moment when there seems to be widespread public doubt about whether to continue supporting the study of the past as this organization has traditionally understood that activity, what is the future of history?\" \"We need to remember the roots of our discipline and be sure to keep telling stories that matter as much to our students and to the public as they do to us. Although the shape and form of our stories will surely change to meet the expectations of this digital age, the human need for storytelling is not likely ever to go away. It is far too basic to the way people make sense of their lives\u2014and among the most important stories they tell are those that seek to understand the past\".(p. 5) [Houston et al. 2011](#B19-religions-13-00563)). This work will adopt the understanding of storytelling from its most basic and oral traditional roots, the informal sharing of stories between two or more individuals through voice and gestures to connect and make meaning of their situations. In her book \"Composing Life\", the renowned anthropologist Mary Catherine [Bateson](#B2-religions-13-00563)( [2001](#B2-religions-13-00563)) wrote what seems to be a timeless quote. Bateson wrote: Wherever a story comes from, whether it is a familiar myth or a private memory, the retelling exemplifies the making of a connection from one pattern to another: a potential translation in which narrative becomes parable and the once upon a time comes to stand for some renascent truth. This approach applies to all the incidents of everyday life: the phrase in the newspaper, the endearing or infuriating game of a toddler, the misunderstanding at the office. Our species thinks in metaphors and learns through stories. 2.2. Spiritual Conversations [https://www.lexico.com/definition/spirit](https://www.lexico.com/definition/spirit), accessed on 8 April 2020). The dictionary further describes the spirit as \"[t]he non-physical part of a person regarded as their true self and as capable of surviving physical death or separation\". Gleaning from the definition of the word 'spirit' above and the relationship that the dictionary made with the word religion, it makes sense that spiritual care has a long history in the care provided by religious leaders that sometimes the terms spiritual and religion tend to be used to refer to the same concept. A working definition of spiritual care is likely to encompass some understanding of religion in its broader sense beyond the confines of the institution of religion. This work is based on a working definition of spiritual care informed by the contributions of various researchers and authors in the field of spiritual care (cf. [Ivy working definition of spiritual care for this work is\u2014The care that seeks to sustain, support, and vitalize the health and wellbeing of the human spirit, aiming to promote holistic health and finding relevant treatment approaches to facilitate healing for a wounded spirit. Spiritual care integrates relevant therapeutic theories to instill hope and promote holistic health and wellbeing in individuals and their families from the inside out. This care is aimed at vitalizing the spirit to embolden the body and support both intra- and interpersonal relationships. [MacKinlay 2006](#B27-religions-13-00563)). [Mitty](#B32-religions-13-00563)( [2010, p. 58](#B32-religions-13-00563)), who contends, \"storytelling can be therapeutic. For the person,\" She proceeds, \"it is both validating and valuing\u2014as nothing else can do. There is a connection between old age and spirituality and a quest for transcendence\u2014to express one's self as part of the human condition.\" Older adults who tell their stories keep their memories and values alive; it can reunite a family. Sometimes couched in terms of creativity, storytelling is sharing and transmitting something that is likely new, not known (or seen) before, and valued. [Saffran](#B40-religions-13-00563)( [2021](#B40-religions-13-00563)) writes Stories are not just ubiquitous; they are powerful. Imagery, verisimilitude, and the sense of a storyteller speaking in their own voice engage our emotions and stick in our memory. The question is, how do we go about employing storytelling and listening with older adults or encourage storytelling in therapeutic contexts? The answer to that question is the burden of this work. I identified a suitable methodology to analyze some of the work already performed in attempts to recapture this age-old tradition. 3. Methodology [Nolan 2018](#B35-religions-13-00563)), I analyze select spiritual care conversations that draw from this approach of the oral tradition as applied in my work with one older adult in a health care setting as a case example. In his study \"Making our choices\", George [Fitchett](#B17-religions-13-00563)( [2011](#B17-religions-13-00563)) makes an appeal for case studies stating, \"Chaplains need these case studies to provide a foundation for further research about the efficacy of chaplains' spiritual care\" (cf. [Nolan 2018, n.d.](#B30-religions-13-00563)). [Dharamsi and Charles](#B11-religions-13-00563)( [2011](#B11-religions-13-00563)) also describe ethnography as \"... a research method that is used to gain a deeper understanding of human behaviour, motivation, and social interaction within specific and complex cultural contexts\". They state, \"ethnographies provide an in-depth reflection and analysis and paint a portrait of the ways in which culture-sharing groups interpret their experiences and create meaning from their interactions\" (p. 378). This description denotes that the work of the ethnographer provides an in-depth view of the social, political, and cultural context within the cultural group. Ethnography is a qualitative research method where the researcher enters into the setting of those being researched to study and record culture as it unfolds. In his book \"Qualitative Research\", [Shank](#B43-religions-13-00563)( [2002, p. 56](#B43-religions-13-00563)) also accredits ethnography as one of the oldest and most vulnerable of all qualitative research methods. The term is derived from a Greek word that refers to a description of a group of people and their way of life ( [Suzuki et al. 2005](#B44-religions-13-00563)). define autoethnography as \"an approach to research and writing that seeks to describe and systematically analyze personal experience in order to understand cultural experience\" (Abstract). Despite the challenges, and as Suzuki et al. argue, ethnography and autoethnography have merit in the field of qualitative research. They state that: \"ethnographically informed methods can enhance counseling psychology research conducted with multicultural communities and provide better avenues toward a contextual understanding of diversity as it relates to professional inquiry\"(p. 206) [Nolan](#B35-religions-13-00563)( [2018](#B35-religions-13-00563)) opens his discussion by making a case for case study research in spiritual care. He posits: \"possibly the greatest value of case studies is their ability to take us into the intimacy of the bedside and allow fellow chaplains, healthcare colleagues and those who commission chaplaincy care, as well as the general public, to see what actually goes on in the private space of the chaplaincy/spiritual care relationship\" (p. 11). Nolan acknowledges the challenges of methodology that meets the requirement for a \"robust and logical\" process that other can \"check that what has been found out is credible and valid\" (p. 12). He concludes his discussion by affirming the accessibility of research in a case study for both novice and seasoned researchers. I have used ethnographic and autoethnographic methods, incorporating a self-reflective approach, to analyze cumulative spiritual conversations that highlight the use of storytelling/listening with older adults in therapeutic settings. As stated above, the choice of this approach was determined, in part, by the availability of the data from ongoing work with older adults across diverse clinical programs and a curiosity to re-engage the oral traditions in spiritual care. I undertook this work with the understanding that in ethnography, researchers cannot claim to provide a \"neutral account of others' experiences\". As [Dharamsi and Charles](#B11-religions-13-00563)( [2011](#B11-religions-13-00563)) point out, the research is \"influenced by a cultural mediated world, caught up in webs of significance [we] ourselves have spun\" (p. 379). I also attempted a comparative analysis with the narrative therapy approach. [Lee et al.](#B25-religions-13-00563)( [2014](#B25-religions-13-00563)) concludes their study by stating that there are significant benefits for researchers and narrative research if narrative research allows for and affords story sharing. [Dietler and Herbich 1993](#B12-religions-13-00563)). The tribe is the third largest community in Kenya and comprises 13 percent of the Kenyan population. Tradition has it that the Luo people traveled along the River Nile to settle in the Nyanza region on the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya. As reflected through an interdisciplinary approach in contemporary health care contexts, traditional healing approaches in Africa are varied. Storytelling played a significant role in complementing other treatment methods. Such other methods were prevalent not just among the Luo but also among other communities as well as across the continent. Some examples include [Cumes](#B10-religions-13-00563)( [2013](#B10-religions-13-00563)), who introduced his paper on South African Indigenous healing stating that \"Sangomas or inyangas are shamans, healers, priests, and prophets that have been the backbone of Bantu communities, especially in the rural south Africa for eons\" (p. 58). [Wallace](#B48-religions-13-00563)( [2003](#B48-religions-13-00563)), who writes from a specific cultural group in Namibia, asserts that \"Otjiherero-speakers [of Namibia] used herbal medicines, massage and specialist healers\" (p. 356). Finally, [Akunna](#B1-religions-13-00563)( [2015](#B1-religions-13-00563)), in her article observing a practice of a tribe in Nigeria, asserts that \"the Igbo people have revealed a predisposition to harnessing dance's creative force toward safeguarding the wellbeing, interests, and integrity, not only of individuals, but of the fabric of societal life\" (pp. 39-40). [Juma and Juma 2017](#B21-religions-13-00563)). The larger Kenyan Luo communities are spread over a wider region beyond the Northern Nyanza area\u2014the location of my ancestry. Autoethnography as a method of choice in this study provided my Luo ancestry and my curiosity to learn more about the method. My grounding years consisted of limited exposure to the Luo culture with a mix of what was then emerging as a sub-culture with the traceable and dominant influence of the Christian faith. As such, I had the privilege of acquiring knowledge (sometimes as an observer) of this cultural group and sought to revisit what I knew vaguely to understand it more fully. I then accessed the knowledge, now rediscovered, to provide a personal and reflective (autoethnography) perspective ( [Shank 2002, p. 60](#B43-religions-13-00563)). A unique feature of this method is spontaneity, requiring minimal to no structure in practice. The value includes expanding opportunities to establish rapport for deeper connection and gain pertinent information that informs assessment and ongoing interventions. 4. A Case Analysis 4.1. Description 4.2. Storytelling as a Medium in Establishing a Therapeutic Relationship [Fitchett 2011](#B17-religions-13-00563)). Thus recognizing the uniqueness of the patient/client and their different worldview. As such, I employ a modified approach with the same idea. 4.2.1. Storytelling 1: Learn to Know Mr. C 4.2.2. Storytelling Option 2: The Story in Transition 4.2.3. Storytelling Option 3: Connect with Surrounding 4.3. Storytelling for Assessment [Fitchett 1993](#B16-religions-13-00563); [Pruyser 1976](#B37-religions-13-00563)). In his book \"Assessing spiritual needs\", [Fitchett](#B16-religions-13-00563)( [1993](#B16-religions-13-00563)) reviews a model he and his team worked together to develop named 7X7 and three other models. Equipped with such tools, SCPs can employ storytelling to obtain the content for assessment. In the African oral tradition, I have observed such mediums as the use of a familiar song, story, or proverb to help make connections in the process of diagnosis. Questions such as what brings you here or what can you teach us may help SCPs determine how/where to proceed. 4.3.1. Spiritual Story 4.3.2. Option B: Assessing for Spiritual Coping 4.3.3. Option C: Assessing for Spiritual Goals 4.4. Storytelling for Intervention 4.4.1. Incorporating Rituals and Objects 4.4.2. Option B: Expanding Possibilities 4.4.3. Option C: Capitalizing on Presence 5. Theory Integration [Scott](#B42-religions-13-00563)( [2011](#B42-religions-13-00563)) observes, \"storytelling is a quintessentially social activity. It requires not only readers or listeners but other storytellers. Stories are at once the raw material and the cultural product of memory. Their telling creates a sense of immediacy (even when they are about very old events and actions) ... and the universal feeling of taking part\" (p. 205). [Mitty](#B32-religions-13-00563)( [2010](#B32-religions-13-00563)), too, highlights the connection between storytelling and old age when she writes \"there is a connection between old age and spirituality and a quest for transcendence\u2014to express one's self as part of the human condition\". Mitty writes from a Nursing perspective and provides suggestions \"on how to help older adults tell their stories, even if they are cognitively challenged by memory and language loss\" (p. 58). The stories facilitate a meaningful connection and provide opportunities for older adults to add key details to their stories with each encounter. There are specific skills that may enhance the efforts of SCPs in their attempt to encourage storytelling in spiritual conversations and add value to the process of making meaning with older adults. I will outline three, recognizing that there are many other skills that practitioners can acquire through spiritual care education and training programs. This section will analyze three basic skills that practitioners can start with and continue to grow and other skills through their encounters with patients/residents and allow the experience to lead the process. 5.1. Sponteinity to Flow with the Rythym 5.2. Attentive to the Flow of the Story 5.3. Affirming the Story [Fitchett](#B16-religions-13-00563)( [1993](#B16-religions-13-00563)) notes, \"Assessment is both a statement of a perception and a process of information gathering and interpreting\" (p. 17). He argues that assessment is both process and content. Since the publishing of that work, Fitchett has performed extensive work in spiritual assessment, some in collaboration with others (cf. [Fitchett 2011](#B17-religions-13-00563); [Nolan 2018](#B35-religions-13-00563)). In a keynote speech titled: \"Assessing spiritual needs in clinical setting\" in 2009, Fitchett outlined assessment tools in spiritual care, including templates developed by Pulchaski in 1999. He developed the tool with the acronym FICS which stands for Faith-belief, Importance, Community, Address in care in taking a spiritual history. The American Family Physician Journal reprinted the document that discusses a tool with the acronym HOPE, representing; H-Sources of hope; care and end-of-life issues. These tools and others within the field are essential in spiritual care and should be considered complementary in the process of gathering information for assessment, especially in cases where the option of storytelling is significantly diminished. Such processes and tools equip SCPs with the resources needed to provide relevant and effective care. However, storytelling can go a long way in complementing standardized tools and processes to help locate the individual within the group. Encouraging patients/residents to narrate their story in their own words can empower the individual patient/resident, reassure them of their humanity and dignity and add value to their process of meaning-making. This practice can foster meaningful conversations with older adults. 6. Storytelling and Narrative Approach in Therapy: A Comparative Analysis [Bergner 2007](#B3-religions-13-00563)). Writing from the perspective of a therapist, Bergner asserts, \"there is something about a good story, particularly one with personal relevance to the listener that gives it usually good staying power\". He proceeds to state, \"told well and used judiciously, stories stand out from the gestalt of the overall therapeutic conversation and tend not to be forgotten\" (p. 5). There are similarities between the storytelling and narrative approach, such that a practitioner familiar with storytelling may be more inclined to work effectively with the narrative approach in therapy. [Moen](#B33-religions-13-00563)( [2006](#B33-religions-13-00563)) addressed the topic of narrative Research and used the words, stories, and narratives interchangeably in her work. She wrote: One way of structuring these experiences is to organize them into meaningful units. One such meaningful unit could be a story, a narrative. For most people, storytelling is a natural way of recounting experience, a practical solution to a fundamental problem in life, creating reasonable order out of experience. Not only are we continually producing narratives to order and structure our life experiences, we are also constantly being bombarded with narratives from the social world we live in. We create narrative descriptions about our experiences for ourselves and others, and we also develop narratives to make sense of the behavior of others.(p. 60) [Doehring](#B13-religions-13-00563)( [2015](#B13-religions-13-00563)) claims, \"caregivers can listen for underlying emotions that might point to a constellation of values, beliefs, and practices that make emotional/spiritual care\" (p. 5). In their entirety, stories seem to have a quality of sufficiency, whether employed for simple entertainment or formal education. [Bitter](#B4-religions-13-00563)( [2014](#B4-religions-13-00563)) writes about the narrative approach stating that \"narrative therapists approach self-language and self-talk much more holistically: People live \"storied\" lives, and their stories have contexts or backgrounds of interpreted experience, but they also intend and move toward anticipated outcomes in the future\" (p. 311). Therapists seek to identify and shed a spotlight on family stories that control, contrasting them with stories that allow personal control. The case above described a situation with a patient who is living with specific health challenges that have caused a significant physical and cognitive decline. In such cases, I provide storytelling a chance to help gain relevant information in unfavorable conditions. In a case where the patient/resident is able and capable of engaging in a conversation and recalling details of their story with minimal to no assistance, the work of SCPs may feel much easier. The SCPs only need to be available, create an environment that can foster meaningful spiritual conversations, and allow themselves to receive and learn from the seasoned wisdom that is the human library. In the process, SCPs present patients/residents with the gift of their presence. As [Van Katwyk](#B47-religions-13-00563)( [2003](#B47-religions-13-00563)) writes, \"it is important to encourage an approach that \"critically assesses the impact of our personal and communal stories and, through therapeutic conversation, seeks to reinterpret, sometimes rewrite, closed and oppressive stories into alternative versions which open up to life and include our creative participation\" (p. 369). [Parry and Doan](#B38-religions-13-00563)( [1994](#B38-religions-13-00563)) summarize in their discussion, therapeutic stories carry information about the familial traditions and meaning constructions of the particular people involved and also deconstruct and revise phases of therapy. As family tales told in the therapeutic environment, they help reveal the major sources of authorship that were influential in penning the scripts, which the family members have been invited to accept as \"just the way things are\". [Robinson-Wood](#B39-religions-13-00563)( [2005](#B39-religions-13-00563)) also observes, \"at its core, storytelling has long served as a way to articulate what is, and how our present realities have come to be\". When applied to counseling, storytelling facilitates the communication by the client about experiences in a language that is comfortable and familiar. 7.
