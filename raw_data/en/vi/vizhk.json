FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT is approved for use in persons aged 6 months and older. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINIS TRATION For intramuscular injection only. 2.1 Dosage and Schedule The dose and schedule for FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT are presented in Table 1. Table 1. FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT: Dosing Age Vaccination Status Dose and Schedule 6 months through 8 years Not previously vaccinated with influenza vaccine Two doses (0.5 -mL each) at least 4 weeks apart Vaccinated with influenza vaccine in a previous season One or 2 dosesa (0.5-mL each) 9 years and older Not applicable One 0.5 -mL dose a One dose or 2 doses (0.5- mL each) depending on vaccination history as per the annual Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation on prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines. If 2 doses, administer each 0.5- mL dose at least 4 weeks apart. 2.2 Administration Instructions Shake well before administration . Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these cond itions exists, the vaccine should not be administered. Attach a sterile needle to the prefilled syringe and administer intramuscularly. The preferred sites for intramuscular injection are the anterolateral thigh for children aged 6 through 11 months and th e deltoid muscle of the upper arm for persons aged 12 months and older . Do not inject in the gluteal area or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk. Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT is a suspension for injection available in 0.5-mL prefilled TIP -LOK syringes . 3 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT to anyone with a history of severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine, including egg protein, or following a previous dose of any influenza vaccin e [see Description (11)] . 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome If Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior influenza vaccine, the decision to give FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks. The 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an elevated r isk of GBS. Evidence for a causal relation of GBS with other influenza vaccines is inconclusive; if an excess risk exists, it is probably slightly more than 1 additional case/ 1 million persons vaccinated. 5.2 Syncope Syncope (fainting) can occur in associa tion injectable vaccines, including FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT . Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual disturbance, paresthesia, and tonic -clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to avoid fa lling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope. 5.3 Preventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions Prior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the immunization history for possible vaccine sensitivity and previous vaccination -related adverse reactions. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT. 5.4 Altered Immunocompetence If FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT is administered to immuno suppressed persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the immune response may be lower than in immunocompetent persons. 5.5 Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness Vaccination with FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT may not prote ct all susceptible individuals. 5.6 Persons at Risk of Bleeding As with other intramuscular injections, FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT should be given with caution in individuals with bleeding disorders such as hemophilia or on anticoagulant therapy to avoid the risk of hematoma following the injection. 4 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observ ed in practice. There is the possibility that broad use of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT could reveal adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials. In adults who received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT , the most common ( 10%) s olicited local adverse reaction w as pain (60%); the most common ( 10%) s olicited systemic adverse reactions were muscle aches (26%), headache (22%), fatigue (22%), and arthralgia (15%). In children aged 6 through 35 months who received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT, the most common ( 10%) solicited local adverse reaction was pain (40%); the most common ( 10%) solicited systemic adverse reactions were irritability (49%), drowsiness (37%), and loss of appetite (29%). In children aged 3 t hrough 17 years who received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT , the most common (10%) solicited local adverse reaction was pain (65%). In children aged 3 through 4 years, the most common ( 10%) solicited systemic adverse reactions were irritability (26%), drowsiness (21%), and loss of appetite (17%). In children aged 5 t hrough 17 years, the most common ( 10%) systemic adverse reactions were muscle aches (29%), been administered in 8 clinical trials to 1,384 adults aged 18 years and older , 1,965 children aged 6 through 35 months , and 3,516 children aged 3 through 17 years . FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT in Adults Trial 1 (NCT01196975) was double -blind, active- controlled , safety and immunogenic ity trial. In this trial, subjects received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT (n = 1,272) , or one of 2 formulations of a comparator trivalent influenza vaccine ( FLULAVAL , TIV-1, n = 213 or TIV -2, n = 218) , each containing an influenza type B virus that corresponded to one of the 2 B viruses in FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT (a type B virus of the Victoria lineage or a type B virus of the Yamagata lineage) . The population was aged 18 years and older (mean age : 50 years ) and 61% were female; 61% of subjects were white, 3% were black , 1% were Asian, and 35% were of other racial/ethnic groups. Solicited adverse events were collected for 7 days (day of vaccination and the next 6 days ). The incidence of solicited adverse reactions occurring within 7 days of vaccination in adults are shown in Table 2. 5 Table 2.

The unsolicited adverse reactions that occurred most frequently ( 1% for FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT ) included nasopharyngitis, upper 6 respiratory tract infection, headache, cough, and oropharyngeal pain. S erious adverse events occurr ing within 21 days of vaccination were reported in 0.4%, 0%, and 0% of subjects who randomized, observer -blind, active -controlled immunogenicity and safety trial. The trial included subjects aged 6 through 35 months who received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT ( n = 1,207) or FLUZONE -licensed inactivated influenza vaccine (n = 1,217) used as comparator, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc . Children with no history of influenza vaccination received 2 doses of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or the comparator vaccine approximately 28 days apart. Children with a history of influenza vaccination received one dose of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or the comparator vaccine. In the overall population, 53% were male; 64% were white, 16% were black, 3% were Asian, and 17% were of other racial/ethnic groups. The mean age of subjects was 20 months. Subjects were followed for safety for 6 months; s olicited local adverse reactions and systemic adverse events were collected for 7 days (day of vaccination an d the next 6 days ) post vaccination. The incidence of solicited adverse reactions occurring within 7 days of vaccination in children are shown in Table 3. 7 Table 3.

In children who received a second dose of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or the comparator vaccine, the incidences of solicited adverse reactions followi ng the second dose were generally similar or lower than those observed after the first dose. Unsolicited adverse events occurring within 28 days of vaccination were reported in 46% and 44% of subjects who received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT ( n = 1,207 ) and the comparator vaccine (n = 1,217), respectively. The unsolicited adverse reactions that occurred most frequently ( 1%) for FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT included upper respiratory tract infection, cough, diarrhea, pyrexia, vomiting, and rash. S erious adverse events occurr ing during the study period (approximately 6 months) were reported in 2% of subjects who received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT and in 2% of subjects who received the comparator vaccine. There were no deaths reported during the study period. 8 Trial 2 (NCT01198756) was a randomized , double -blind, active -controlled trial. In this trial, subjects received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT ( n = 932) or one of 2 formulations of a comparator trivalent influenza vaccine [FLU ARIX (Influenza Vaccine) , TIV -1 (B Victoria) = 929 -2 (B Yamagata) , n = 932] , each containing an influenza type B virus that corresponded to one of the 2 B viruses in FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT (a type B virus of the Victoria lineage or a type B virus of the Yamagata lineage) . The population was aged 3 through 17 years (mean age: 9 years) and 53% were male; 65% were w hite, 13 % were Asian, 9% were black , and 13% were of other racial/ethnic groups. Children aged 3 t hrough 8 years with no history of influenza vaccination received 2 doses approximat ely 28 days apart. Children aged 3 through 8 years with a history of influenza vaccination and children aged 9 years and older received one dose. Solicited local adverse reactions and systemic adverse events were collected for 7 days (day of vaccination and t he next 6 days) . The incidence of solicited adverse reactions occurring within 7 days of vaccination in children are shown in Table 4. 9 Table 4.

Unsolicited adverse events occurring within 28 days of vaccination were reported in 30%, 31% , and 30% of subjects who = 932), FLUARI X TIV -1 (B Victoria) ( n = 929), or TIV -2 (B Yamagata) (n = 932) , respectively . The unsolicited adverse reactions that occurred most frequently ( for FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT) included vomiting, pyrexia, respiratory infection, headache, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and rhinorrhea. S erious adverse events occurr ing within 28 days of any vaccination were reported in 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.2% of subjects who received , respectively a randomized, observer -blind, non- influenza vaccine -controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT . The trial included subjects aged 3 through 8 years who received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT ( n = 2,584 ) or HAVRIX (Hepatitis A Vaccine) (n = 2,584) as a control vaccine. Children with no history of influenza vaccination received 2 doses of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or HAVRIX approximately 28 days apart (this dosing regimen for HAVRIX is not a U.S. -licensed schedule) . Children with a history of influenza vaccination received one dose of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or HAVRIX. In the overall population, 52% were male; 60% were Asian, 5% were white, and 35% were of other racial/ethnic groups . The mean age of subjects was 5 years. Solicited local adverse reactions and systemic adverse events were collected for 7 days (day of vaccination and the next 6 days ).

In children who received a second dose of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or HAVRIX, the incidences of adverse reactions following the second dose were generally lower than those observed after the first dose. The frequency of unsolicited adverse events occurring within 28 days of vaccination was similar in both groups ( 33% for both FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT and HAVRIX ). The unsolicited adverse reactions that occurred most frequently 1% for FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT) included diarrhea, pyrexia, tract varicella, cough, and rhinorrhea. S erious adverse events occurr ing within 28 days of any vaccination were reported in 0.7% of su bjects who received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT and in 0.2% of subjects who received HAVRIX. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Beyond those events reported in the clinical trials for FLU LAVAL QUADRIVALENT or FLU LAVAL , the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or FLULAVAL (trivalent influenza vaccine) . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their fre quency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Lymphadenopathy. Eye Disorders Eye pain, photophobia . Gastrointestinal Disorders Dysphagia , vomiting. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Chest pain, injection site inflammation, asthenia, injection site rash, influenza- like symptoms, abnormal gait, injection site bruising, injection site sterile abscess . Immune System Disorders Allergic reactions Tissue Disorders Muscle weakness, arthritis . 13 Nervous System Disorders Dizziness, p limb paralysis . Psychiatric Disorders Respiratory, Mediastinal dysphonia, . Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Urticaria, localized or generalized rash, pruritus, sweating . Vascular Disorders Flushing, pallor . 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Concomitant Administration w ith Other Vaccines FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT should not be mixed with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial. There are insufficient data to assess the concomitant administration of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT with other vaccines. When concomitant administration of other vaccines is required , the vaccines should be administered at di fferent injection sites. 7.2 Immunosuppressive Therapies Immunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses) may reduce the immune response to FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT . 8 USE IN SPECIFIC PO PULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register women by calling 1- 888-452-9622. 14 Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. There are insufficien t data on FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT in pregnant women to inform vaccine - associated risks. A developmental toxicity study was performed in female rats administered FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT prior to mating and during gestation and lactation periods. The total dose was 0.2 mL at each occasion (a single human dose is 0.5 mL). This study revealed no adverse effects on fetal or pre- weaning development due to FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT ( see Data ). Clinical Considerations Disease -Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk : Pregnant women infected with seasonal influenza are at increased risk of severe illness associated with influenza infection compared with non- pregnant women. P regnant women with influenza may be at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm labor and delivery. Data Animal Data: In a developmental toxicity study, female rats were administered FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT by intramuscular injection 4 and 2 weeks prior to mating , on G estation D ays 3, 8, 11, and 15, and on L actation D ay 7. The total dose was 0.2 mL at each occasion (a single human dose is 0.5 mL) . No adverse effects on pre -weaning development up to P ostnatal Day 25 were observed. There were no vaccine -related fetal malformations or variations . 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT in childr en younger than 6 months have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In a randomized, double -blind, active -controlled trial, immunogenicity and safety were evaluated in a 15 cohort of subjects aged 65 years and older who received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT (n = 397); approximately one -third of these subjects were aged 75 years and older . In subjects aged 65 years and older , the geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) post -vaccination and seroconversion rates were lower than in younger subjects ( aged 18 to 64 years) and the frequencies of solicited and unsolicited adverse reactions were gen erally lower than in younger subjects [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14.2)] . 11 DESCRIPTION FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT is a quadrivalent, split- virion, inactivated influenza virus vaccine prepared from virus propagated in the allantoic cavity of embryonated hens' eggs. Each of the influenza virus es is produced and purified separately. The virus is inactivated with ultraviolet light treatment followed by formaldehyde treatment, purified by centrifugation, and disrupted with sodium deoxycholate. FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT is a sterile, opalescent , translucent to off -white suspension in a phosphate -buffered saline solution that may sediment slightly . The sediment resuspends upon shaking to form a homogeneous suspension. FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT has been standardized according to U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS ) requirements for the 2020- 2021 influenza season and is formulated to contain 60 micrograms (mcg) hemagglutinin ( HA) per 0.5 -mL dose in the recommended ratio of 15 mcg HA of each of the following 4 influenza virus strains (2 A strains and 2 B strains) FLULAVAL is without preservatives and does not contain thimerosal. Each 0.5- mL dose may also contain residual amounts of ovalbumin ( 0.3 mcg ( 887 mcg) from the manufacturing process. Antibiotics are not used in the manufacture of this vaccine. The tip caps and plungers of the prefilled syringes of FLU LAVAL QUADRIVALENT are not made with natural rubber latex. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACO LOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Influenza illness and its complications follow infection with influenza viruses. Global surveillance of influenza identifies yearly antigenic variants. Since 1977, antigenic variants of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. Public health authorities recommend influenza vaccine strains annually. Inactivated influenza vaccines are standardized to contain the hemagglutinins of strains representing the influenza viruses likely to circulate in the United Sta tes during the influenza season . 16 Specific levels of h emagglutination inhibiti on (HI) antibody titer post -vaccination with inactivated influenza virus vaccines have not been correlated with protection from influenza illness but the antibody titers have been used as a measure of vaccine activity. I n some human challenge studies, antibody titers of 1:40 have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects .1,2 Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers little or no protection against another virus. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virological basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual change of one or more new strains in each year's influenza vaccine. Annual revaccination is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination and because circulat ing strains of influenza virus change from year to year. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT has not been evaluated for carcinogenic , mutagenic potential , or male infertility in animals . Vaccination of female rats with FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT had no effect on fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Efficacy against Influenza The efficacy of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT was evaluated in Trial 3, a randomized, observer - blind, non- influenza vaccine -controlled trial con ducted in 3 countries in Asia, 3 in Latin America, and 2 in the Middle East/Europe during the 2010- 2011 influenz a season. Healthy subjects aged 3 through 8 years were randomized (1:1) to receive or HAVRIX ( n = 2,584) , as a control vaccine. Children with no history of influenza vaccination received 2 doses of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or HAVRIX approximately 28 days apart. Children with a history of influenza vaccination received one dose of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or HAVRIX [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . In the overall population, 52% were male ; 60% were Asian, 5% were white, and 35% were of other racial/ethnic groups. Th e mean age of subjects was 5 years. Efficacy of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT was assessed for the prevention of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) -positive influenza A and/or B disease presenting as influenza -like illness (ILI) . ILI was defined as a temperature 100\u00b0F in the presence of at least one of the following symptoms on the same day: cough, sore throat, runny nose, or nasal congestion. Subjects with ILI (monitored by passive and active surveillance for approximately 6 months ) had nasal and throat swabs collected and tested for influenza A and/or B by RT-PCR. All RT-PCR -positive specimens were further tested in cell culture . Vaccine efficacy was calculated based on the ATP cohort for efficacy (Table 6 ). 17 Table 6.

In an exploratory analysis by age, vaccine efficacy against RT -PCR- positive influenza A and/or B disease presenting as ILI was evaluated in subjects aged 3 through 4 years and 5 through 8 years ; vaccine efficacy was 35 .3% (95% CI: , respectively . As the trial lacked statistical power to e valuate efficacy within age subgroups, the clinical significance of these results is unknown. As a secondary objective in the trial, subjects with RT -PCR- positive influenza A and/or B were prospectively classified based on the presence of adverse outcomes that have been associated with 18 influenza infection (defined as fever >102.2\u00b0F /39.0\u00b0C, physician- verified shortness of croup, and/or media physician- diagnosed serious extra -pulmonary complications, including myositis, encephalitis, seizure and/or myocarditis). The risk reduction of fever >102.2\u00b0F/39.0\u00b0C associated with RT -PCR- positive i nfluenza was 71.0% (95% CI: 44.8, 84.8) based on the ATP cohort for efficacy [ FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT (n = 12/2,379); HAVRIX (n = 41/2,398)] . The other pre-specified adverse outcomes had too few cases to calculat e a risk reduction. The incidence of these adverse outcomes is presented in Table 7. Table 7.

In this trial, subjects received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT (n = 1,246) or one of 2 formulations of a comparator trivalent influenza vaccine ( FLULAVAL, TIV -1, n = 204 or TIV -2, n = 211) , each containing an influenza type B virus that corresponded to one of the 2 B viruses in FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT (a type B virus of the Victoria lineage or a type B virus of the Yamagata lineage) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Immune responses, specifically hemagglutination inhibition ( HI) antibody titers to each virus strain in the vaccine, were evaluated in sera obtained 21 days after administration of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or the comparator s. The immunogenicity endpoint w as GMTs adjusted for baseline, performed on the According -to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for whom immunogenicity assay results were available after vaccination . FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT was non- inferior to both TIVs based on adjusted GMTs (Table 8) . The antibody response to influenza B strains contained in FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT was higher than the antibody response after vaccination with a TIV containing an influenza B strain from a different lineage. There was no evidence that the addition of the second B strain resulted in immune interference to other strains included in the vaccine (Table 8 ). 20 Table 8.

In this trial, subjects received 0.5 mL of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT containing 15 mcg HA of each of the 4 influenza strains included in the vaccine ( n = 1,207 ); or 0.25 mL of control vaccine FLUZONE QUADRIVALENT (Influenza Vaccine) containing 7.5 mcg HA of each of the 4 influenza strains included in the vaccine (n = 1,217) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Immun e responses, specifically HI antibody titers to each virus strain in the vaccine, were ev aluated in 21 sera obtained 28 days following completion of vaccination regimen. Previously vaccinated children received one dose and previously unvaccinated children (i.e., unprimed individuals) received 2 doses 4 weeks apart of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or the comparator . The immunogenicity endpoints were GMTs adjusted for baseline, and the percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversion, defined as a pre -vaccination HI titer of <1:10 with a post -vaccination titer 1:40 or at least a 4-fold increase in serum HI titer over baseline to 1:40, following vaccination, performed on the ATP c ohort . FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT was non -inferior to the comparator for all 4 vaccine strains based on adjusted GMTs and seroconversion rates (Table 9). 22 Table 9.

In this trial, subjects received FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT ( n = 878) , or one of 2 formulations of a comparator trivalent influenza vaccine (FLUARIX, TIV -1, n = 871 or TIV -2 n = 878) , each containing an influenza type B virus that corresponded to one of the 2 B viruses in FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT (a type B virus of the Victoria lineage or a type B virus of the Yamagata lineage) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Immune responses, specifically H I antibody titers to each virus strain in the vaccine, were evaluated in sera obtained 28 days following one or 2 doses of FLULAVAL QUADRIVALENT or the comparator s.
