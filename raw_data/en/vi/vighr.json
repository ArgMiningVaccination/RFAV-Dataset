Important Questions Answers Why This Matters: What is the overall deductible ? $2,500 $5,000 family /$4,000 out-of-network per person; $10,750 family. You must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all family members meets the overall family deductible . The deductible starts over each April 1st. See the chart starting on page 2 for how much you pay for covered services after you meet the deductible. Are there services covered before you meet your deductible ? Yes. Deductible doesn't apply to in-network: preventive care, Teladoc, office visits, prescription drugs , outpatient facility labs, or advanced imaging . Doesn't apply to in- or out -of-network: emergency room, urgent care, convenient care, or emergency transportation. This plan covers some items and services even if you haven't yet met the deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may a pply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible . See a list of covered preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive -care-benefits/ . Are there other deductibles for specific services? No. You do no t have to meet deductibles for specific services, but see the chart starting on page 2 for other costs for services this plan covers. What is the out-of-pocket limit for family . There is a separate out -of-pocket limit for prescription drugs (see page 3). The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you have other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met. What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit ? Premiums , balance -billing charges, and health care this plan doesn't cover. Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out-of-pocket limit . Will you pay less if you use a network provider ? Yes. See http://myhealthtoolkitfl.com , contact Essential Advocate at 1 -888-521-2583 or call BCBS customer service at 1-855-258-9029 for a list of network providers . This plan uses a provider network . You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan's network . You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network provider , and you might receive a bill from a provider for the difference between the provider's charge and what your plan pays (balance bill ing). Be aware, your network provider might use an out-of-network provider for some services (such as lab work). Check with your provider before you get services. See the chart starting on page 2 for how this plan pays different kinds of providers. Do you need a referral to see a specialist ? No. You can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan.
