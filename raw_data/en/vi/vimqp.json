(you know medicine NOT approved by scientists). He strongly believed in that, long story short I realized that the asshat would guilt trip me as fuck, (wanted) control what I ate and do. By that horrible experience it has left me HATE alt meds even more. Things asshat said. m. I am gonna eat two (common) painkillers, my head hurts. AH. - big long sigh - Do you have to? Now I have to work on removing more bad engergy ( yes he knew I also didn't believe in that mindset too) m. wtf? Do you want me to have a headache? AH. yes, your headache will go away in a few hours anyway. I wonder if others /real people are like that asshat? (of course not I mean no disrespect towards people that use alt meds ) (plottwist, I live in EU) "}
