I graduated from Brandeis University double majoring in International Relations and Middle Eastern Studies in hopes of a political career. I also studied Art History and Literature at Sorbonne University in Paris to fulfill my passion in arts and the French language. After graduation, I went on to work as an analyst at an investment management firm in Boston. After a few years in the field feeling unfulfilled, I realized that my path lies not in finance, but in helping others achieve healthy skin they feel confident in. At 24 years old, my skin severely broke out in cystic acne. The following two years were difficult and frustrating where I often felt hopeless and ashamed to hold my head high. It was during this time I realized how important the condition of your skin is to your overall health and self image. I spent all my free time researching and nursing my skin back to health. I was certain my face would be permanently marred but fast forward a couple years, my skin looks healthy, happy, and like nothing ever happened to it! I decided to attend the Euro Institute to formally learn about skin and also did my oncology training. This has prepared me to share and utilize all of that knowledge to help you achieve your best potential skin health and appearance! | | Crystal Ricciardi CN - Certified Functional Nutritionist Crystal is a certified functional nutritionist and occupational therapist.
