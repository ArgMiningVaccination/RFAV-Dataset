Get into a comfortable position. 2. Spend 30 seconds on each point, following the order shown below. Apply firm pressure while breathing steadily into your abdomen. 3. As a maintenance routine, you can do this once in the morning and once before bed. If you start feeling fatigued, weak, or like you might be coming down with something, up it to three times a day. [Kidney (KI) 27](https://theory.yinyanghouse.com/acupuncturepoints/kidney_meridian_graphic): KI27 is a superior immune-boosting point. It is located roughly one inch from your midline (draw an imaginary line down the front of your body that passes from your nose down through your belly button), on the lower border of the collar bone. [Ren (CV) 17 and Ren (CV) 6](https://theory.yinyanghouse.com/acupuncturepoints/conceptionvessel_meridian_graphic): CV17 and CV6 both strengthen the immune system. CV17 is located on the midline of the sternum (breastbone) just slightly above the nipple level. CV6 is located on the midline two finger-widths below the belly button. [Large Intestine (LI) 11](https://theory.yinyanghouse.com/acupuncturepoints/largeintestine_meridian_graphic): LI11, although more useful as a fever-reducing point, is also used to help prevent colds, flu and other immune-compromising conditions. Find this point at the lateral (outer) edge of the elbow crease. [Lung (LU) 7](https://theory.yinyanghouse.com/acupuncturepoints/lung_meridian_graphic): LU7 is a very common point to use for symptomatic relief of cough, headache and/or stiff neck. It can be used to increase the defensive qi and your immune system. To locate it simply make a thumbs-up sign. When you do that you'll see a depression at the base of your thumb. From that depression, LU7 is located approximately two finger-widths up your arm. [Large Intestine (LI) 4](https://theory.yinyanghouse.com/acupuncturepoints/largeintestine_meridian_graphic): LI4 is a famous decongestant and anti-inflammatory point. It is a powerful point for any head pain or tension and strengthens the immune system. It's located in the space between the thumb and first finger, half-way along from the wrist crease to the fist knuckle. [Stomach (ST) 36](https://theory.yinyanghouse.com/acupuncturepoints/stomach_meridian_graphic): ST36 is one of the most effective acupuncture points for strengthening the immune system and recovering from fatigue. ST36 is found about a hand length below the kneecap, slightly lateral and in beside the prominent tibia bone. **There are many places online to explore for further assistance finding these acupuncture points.
