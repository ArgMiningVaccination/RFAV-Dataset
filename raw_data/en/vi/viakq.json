The book is based on Native American stories, which cover three generations, fifty years, several families, and there are many relationships. Love Medicine is a collection of short fiction stories of \"people that are living on Chippewa reservation in North Dakota\". Louise Erdrich makes the story with use of flashback. Love Medicine is not on particularly one theme but there are some stories on other themes such as, true identity, religion, family, love etc. Love Medicine is the creative formation of stories and characters which allow for the original creation of love. Each character exposes his or her individuality Holistic assessments in nursing provide a unique quality of care to the individual patient. Holism in the provision of care includes assessments obtaining data about the physiological, psychological, sociological, spiritual, developmental, cultural and environmental aspects.

I did know, however, that I wanted to understand the concepts of alternative healing methods better because I had just experienced the death of my grandfather from a diabetic induced disease while I had stood idly by\u2014with nothing I could do to help. I also understood that I wanted to learn more about the subject that I had become quite passionate about through my own 100-pound weight loss journey\u2014nutrition. Little did I know that this decision would not only further spark my passion, but Love Medicine Since the beginning of colonization of America, there has been the problem of dealing with the indigenous people of the land. After the first attempts in eradicating the population, the American government changed its policy to integration. It is this integration into white society and the severance from the Indian culture that causes disenfranchisement in the modern Indian reservation. In Louise Erdrich's Love Medicine, the contradictory efforts to isolate the Native Americans on reservations and to make \"regular\" Americans of them are seen over roughly a fifty-year period. The Morrisseys, Kashpaws, Lamartines, Lazarres and others must define their relations to alien religions, customs, economic realities, and Lipsha also grows up without knowing of his ancestry and therefore feels incomplete. Added to the stress of this, Lipsha also feels detached from the white society by having the ability to use the old Indian medicines. Yet through the latter part of the book, Lipsha finds redemption from his disenfranchisement by finding the identity of his parents and accepting his talent. It is after he The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Program at National vigorously prepares students for life as Naturopathic Physician in the alternative medicine field. One unique way that National prepares students is through its integrated classrooms. This integration of students from different programs in the same course allows the students to interact and make connections with other students. Creating connections is Holistic Healing Argumentative Dr. James Marcum, a cardiologist at the Chattanooga Heart Institute in Tennessee claims, \"Pharmaceutical drugs don't heal people.\" In fact, he states, \"Much of the time they do more harm than good\"(Milner). U.S. Citizens need to stop taking harmful pills and start using more natural, holistic healing methods. Everyone has probably used a pill before to relieve their pain, but there are healthier ways to feel just as good. According to the results of the National Health Interview Survey, \"In 2012, 33.2% of U.S. adults used complementary health approaches\"(What Complementary and Integrative Approaches Do Americans Use?). While some people believe conventional medicine is a better choice, it is clear that holistic healing can replace prescription drugs because they are more safe and effective than prescription drugs, and they are more practical in many ways. Shamanistic Healing Shamanistic healing, one of the oldest spiritual healing powers, has recently become a topic of interest in modern medicine. An increasing number of medical schools are now offering courses in alternative medicine for their students, and some hospitals already have alternative medicine departments. The availability of healers and doctors practicing holistic medicine has also increased in recent years, and more and more people are educating themselves in these new fields. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that between 65 and 80 percent of the world's population (about 3 billion people) rely on traditional medicine as their primary form of health care. Acupuncture The traditional Chinese treatment of acupuncture is an affective alternative medicine that has been around for thousands of years. Acupuncture is one of the most researched and documented alternative medicines around (Acupuncture). Although a vast majority of people believe Western medicine is the only cure to sickness, many people benefit from acupuncture everyday. Most people disregard the ancient art all together without giving it a chance because are scared of the needles it involves. Also, since no accurate scientific explanation of how and why it works has been found, people shy away from it. The healing powers of the body are taken to a whole different level with this alternative medicine. II. Herbal medicine has been used for many, many years and is a great natural alternative to modern medicine. Introduction In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in complementary medicine, and indeed alternative medicine (Lee-Treweek 2002, Andrews 2004, Barry 2006). Moreover the number of professionally trained therapist and practitioners has increased giving the patient/client a better choice and at more competitive rates (Smallwood, 2005). Most patients now prefer herbal medicine as compared to medicinal drugs. They are becoming popular to treat everything from minor to major to diseases. The reason why people are so into herbal medicine is because of their natural qualities that promote a healthy method of healing various products. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
