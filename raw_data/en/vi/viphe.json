Herbs are used in combination within a formula to treat each patient's underlying constitution and root pattern. When prescribed by a qualified practitioner, Chinese herbal medicine is extremely safe and effective. Chinese Herbal Medicine About TCM Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, has been practiced for more than 2500 years in China and remains one of the most popular forms of medicine in the world today. Acupuncture and herbal medicine are used as gentle, yet effective methods of stimulating the body to heal itself. Through the use of thin needles and herbs, the practitioner attempts to create a smooth flow of Qi (energy) through the body. This Qi, or life force, flows through the body along a system of pathways which in English is referred to as Meridians. Blood vessels, nerve pathways, and muscular-skeletal tissues are examples of similar pathways in Western Medicine. The proper interplay between these systems is crucial for optimal physical health and emotional well being. An important part of Chinese Medical philosophy is to understand the patient as a whole, and not only treat the current symptom. Since a disease condition appearing in one part of the body is often a sign of a more general underlying disorder, a practitioner will examine the relationship of multiple systems in order to make an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Based on this treatment philosophy, a Traditional Chinese Medical practitioner will attempt to understand the root of your condition and to improve both your symptoms and your overall quality of life. This emphasis on the relationship between body, mind and spirit distinguishes TCM from many forms of Allopathic (Western) Medicine. "}
