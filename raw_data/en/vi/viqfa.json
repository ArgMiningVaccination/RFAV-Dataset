It uses naturally occurring substances in the form of remedies to stimulate the body's own healing power. The results, although gentle, can be powerful and long lasting. It is suitable for everyone, even sensitive patients, from pregnancy, childhood and adolescence to adulthood and older age. Homeopathy is a natural form of medicine used by over 200 million people worldwide. The holistic nature of homeopathy means we treat each person as a unique individual. Their body, mind, and emotions are all considered in the management and prevention of disease. Taking all these factors into account, a Homeopath will select the most appropriate medicine based on the individual's specific symptoms and personal level of health to stimulate their body's own ability to heal itself. Homeopathy can treat both acute and chronic conditions. Homeopathic medicines are safe to use as they rarely cause side-effects. This means when used appropriately under the guidance of a qualified homeopath they can be taken by people of all ages, including babies, children and pregnant or breastfeeding women.
