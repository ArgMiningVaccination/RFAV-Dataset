As the population begins to age, so will the chances of this disease. Arthritis affects the joints, specifically the cartilage, which helps with shock absorption. When someone experiences arthritic pain, increased inflammation is happening at that joint. Keeping inflammation at bay is one of the best ways to manage the disease and improve the quality of life. What is inflammation anyway? Inflammation is the body's response to a foreign threat and restoring balance. When there is injury or a virus, the immune system creates inflammation to treat the issue. The result is usually pain, redness, warmth, and swelling. However, too much inflammation is dangerous and can impact joints and organs and even reduce life expectancy. [Arthritis](https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/data_statistics/national-statistics.html), by definition, means inflammation of the joint. Some types of arthritis are autoimmune conditions when the immune system attacks healthy joint tissue. Supplements can help Inflammation is supposed to be a temporary response to a temporary issue. Yet, some people have continued toxins, irritants, and other microbes in the body. These foreign substances keep the immune system on continuous alert, which increases arthritic pain. Chronic inflammation can even affect healthy tissue and organs if left untreated. Some natural [supplements](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33297347/) can provide antioxidants and other chemicals to offset the effects of inflammation. Taking the following supplements as directed by a doctor or pharmacist may help 1. Fish oil supplements The oils of some cold-water fish are one of the richest sources of omega-3s fatty acids. These oils are often extracted and used as natural supplements against inflammation. When taken as directed, fish oil supplements reduce cytokines and other substances that cause inflammation. Studies have shown that fish oil also increases anti-inflammatory molecules in the body. 2. Alpha Lipoic Acid Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is another beneficial fatty acid in the fight against inflammation. This unique acid is created naturally in the body but only in small amounts. The ALA needed is found in many foods like red meats, organ meats, and vegetables. ALA is a powerful antioxidant that slows inflammation, signs of aging, and other powerful functions. 3. Turmeric Turmeric is an ingredient in many curries and stews. However, this potent root contains curcumin, the antioxidant that produces the yellow color. Curcumin is filled with antioxidants and can reduce inflammation and help manage related diseases. Both turmeric and curcumin are available in supplement form. When used with pepper, the supplement is much more absorbent. 4. Glucosamine and chondroitin Within healthy cartilage are glucosamine and chondroitin. These two substances help keep cartilage healthy, lubrication, and shock absorption. Both are in the connective tissue of sea animals like sharks, crabs, and shrimp. There are also non-animal sources available. While these supplements won't help with pain directly, glucosamine and chondroitin maintain healthy tissue. In addition, studies show that these supplements improve inflammation and the function of joints. 5. Magnesium Magnesium is an essential mineral responsible for multiple processes in the body. One common benefit is the prevention of excessive inflammation in the body. [Magnesium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25023192/) deficiencies are quite common, and some studies reveal this to be the case of inflammatory stress and chronic disease. Get arthritis under control These are a few of the supplements that can help with arthritis pain. The pain is linked to inflammation, so any supplement that can slow the process is helpful. Despite the usefulness of supplements, people with arthritis should not depend on these alone. A doctor should help with different treatment options, including surgery.
