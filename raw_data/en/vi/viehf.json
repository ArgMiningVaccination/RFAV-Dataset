Over the past few months, we have had the opportunity to meet with many of you to discuss your vision and aspirations for our institution. As a result of these conversati ons, it has become clear that there is a universally strong commitment across all of our campuses and at the system level to pursue a path to excellence that is defined by high-quality, affordable education for our students, innovative research and creative wo rks that distinguish our faculty, engagement with the citizens of Missouri to improve thei r lives and regional ec onomic growth that is driven by careful planning and collaboration. This renewed commitment to excellence will no t be without its challenges. As everyone is well aware, we are facing a period of significant budget constraints that will require us to take bold actions to become a stronger ac ademic institution in both the short- and long-term. To provide some context, the Un iversity of Missouri System's share of the state's current FY17 budget withholds is $37 million with the potential for $57 million in permanent cuts in the Governor's proposed FY18 budget and th e possibility of future reductions. Complicating these financial cha llenges, we continue to address declines in enrollment, a continuing trend facing universities around the country. This is the time for us to implement a lo ng-term plan to address the impact of the reductions in FY18 and beyond. Addressing these challenges will require an overall budgetcut between 8% and 12% throughout the University of Missouri System. It is important toemphasize that we cannot rely on reserve fu nds to solve structural problems created by permanent budget reductions. We also affirm that the financial challenges that we face will not be addressed with across-the-board cu ts. Therefore, final budget cuts for units will vary depending on the programs of excelle nce that need to be supported. As part of this process, we also will need to make new investments to grow the programs of excellence that are not sufficiently funded. While these are never easy decisions to make, we firmly believe that it is essential that we all participate by taking a critical look at each of our organizations to meet the goals of this budget process. This includes administ ration, operations, intercollegiate athletics programs, academic units, extension and ou treach, among others. There are some units that have started the process earlier in the ye ar to prepare for the budget cuts. They are to be commended for developing thoughtful approaches to cut expenses and/or grow revenue. Building on the progress made to da te and to ensure that all units pursue an organized plan, the UM System president ha s asked campus chance llors, provosts and chief financial officers as well as system leadership to develop and execute both short-term and long-term plans for budget reductions based on a set of guiding principles.The guiding principles will serve as our comp ass as we seek to protect activities and programs that best meet the mission of ou r University and provide maximum benefit to . 1 of 4 4/3/2017 12:18 PM our communities, our state and the nation. Our guiding principles will be to: Challenge the status quo and long-held tr aditions that are impediments to change Make strategic decisions based on performance measures of excellence Protect programs of excellence for facult y research and creative works, student outcomes, community engagement and financial aid Be transparent, collaborative and accoun table in making important decisions that affect the institution with input from faculty, students and staff Beyond these immediate actions, it is also important we look long-term to identify new revenue sources to support our University an d continue to make a compelling case for state investment. As dedicated stakeholders of our institution, your feedback is critically important to this process and we welcom e your candid input on the programs of excellence to support and suggestions on ho w the system and its campuses can save on expenses and grow revenues. Please share your best ideas to strengthen MU at yourinput@umsystem.edu . We will provide ongoing details as the budget process evolves on the UM System budget planning webpage . We believe that this collaborative proces s will create a stronger and more vital institution. We look forward to addressing our budget challenges together as we make difficult, but necessary, decisions and continue the University's path to excellence. Thank you very much for your support and commitment for our institution.Mun Choi , UM System President Tom George, UMSL Chancellor Chris Spilling , UMSL Interim Provost Rick Baniak UMSL Vice Chancellor for Administration, CFO Ryan Rapp , UM System Interim Vice President for Finance, CFO Guiding principles: Challenge the status quo and long-held tr aditions that are impediments to change Make strategic decisions based on performance measures of excellence Protect programs of excellence for facult y research and creative works, student outcomes, community engagement and financial aid Be transparent, collaborative and accoun table in making important decisions that affect the institution with input from faculty, students and staff Campus process : Campus leadership will develop plans to ad dress the budget cuts.
