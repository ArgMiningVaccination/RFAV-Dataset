WVU offers 169 undergraduate degrees, 138 master's degrees, 42 doctoral degrees, and 10 professional doctorate degrees. c. number of university faculty, staff and students Faculty and Staff : The 2016- 17 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) Human Resources reports show that WVU has 2,142 full -time instructional staff, 6,187 full -time non-instructional staff, 941 part -time staff and 1,629 graduate assistants. The 2015- 16 IPEDS Fall Enrollment reports list the student -to-faculty ratio of each campus as follows: of WVU's instructional faculty in non- Health Sciences disciplines are either tenured or tenure- track. This percentage does not vary significantly among the campuses. The majority of the instructional faculty in the Health Sciences disciplines, 82.7%, are clinical track. Students: Fall 2017 enrollment included 22,504 undergraduates and 5,905 graduate and professional students. Total enrollment at WVU Morgantown has been stable over the past decade. The majority of the students enrolled are full -time undergraduate degree- seeking students of traditional college- going age. d. brief statement of distinguishing university facts and characteristics WVU offers a wide range of high- quality academic programs at the associate, undergraduate, graduate and professional levels that are consistent with its land -grant mission and the five goals outlined in the University's 2020 strategic plan, which include: Engage undergraduate, graduate, and professional students in a challenging academic environment Excel in research, creative activity, and innov ation in all disciplines. Foster diversity and an inclusive culture. Advance international activity and global engagement. Enhance the well -being and the quality of life of the people of West Virginia. 2 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH WVU's academic degree programs are outlined in the Undergraduate and Graduate/Professional Catalogs, posted on the institution's website, and reported annually to the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and to the Department of Education (DOE). WVU's commitment to advancing research is reflected in its Carnegie Basic Classification, which underscores WVU's position as the only R1 doctoral institution in West Virginia. This profile demonstrates WVU's evolution from a regional undergraduate teaching institution to a research university. In FY 2019 , faculty conducted $1 81.4 million in sponsored contracts and research grants. This represents a 24 percent increase from the previous year ($146.5 million) and a steady climb since 2015, with $133.3 million reported that year. WVU is a family of distincti ve campuses united by a single mission: to provide a quality and affordable education. WVU's two largest regional campuses , WVU Keyser and WVU Beckley, are key to fulfilling the institution's land- grant mission of service to the state. WVU Keyser, which has an open admission policy for West Virginia residents, offers numerous AA degrees that allow students to change campuses and complete a baccalaureate degree in Morgantown; AAS degrees that prepare students to enter the workforce upon completion; four BAS degrees; and a 1 plus 3 BSN in conjunction with the WVU Morgantown School of Nursing. WVU Beckley's vision is to become a STEM and career -oriented teaching institution that supports building economically viable industries in a state where traditional extractive industry activity is waning. WVU Beckley's engineering programs are ranked among the top 100 undergraduate engineering programs by U.S. News & World Report, among other rankings. e. names of all accrediting bodies (other than CEPH) to which the institution responds. The list must include the regional accreditor for the university as well as all specialized accreditors to which any school, college or other organizational unit at the univers ity responds WVU has 194 programs accredited by specialized accrediting bodies. Please see the Introduction Section of the electronic resource file (ERF) for the list of programs accredited by specialized accrediting bodies. f. brief history and evolution of the school of public health (SPH) and related organizational elements, if applicable (e.g., date founded, educational focus, other degrees offered, rationale for offering public health education in unit, etc.) The WVU School of Public Health. On September 28, 2012, the WVU Board of Governors approved the establishment of the School of Public Health (SPH) as an independent school within the Health Sciences Center. This new school, the first established at WVU in over 50 years, is viewed as an essential initiative to help achieve the University's strategic goal to \"enhance the well-being and the quality of life for the people of West Virginia.\" Establishment of the SPH was a watershed moment due, in large part, to the leadership of Christopher C. Col enda, MD, MPH, who was appointed Chancellor of the WVU HSC in November 2009. In addition to the allocation of significant institutional resources, Chancellor Colenda helped secure additional support from the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, and a five- year appropriation commitment of $1 million per year from the State of West Virginia. These resources have allowed the School to achieve 3 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH significant growth during a period characterized by increasing fiscal constraint. Additionally, senior faculty lines , committed to Dean Coben, allowed continued growth over the last five years. Although the WVU SPH was founded in 2012, public health education is not new to the University . The School is building upon a strong foundation of faculty and programs. Our CEPH -accredited MPH program has been in place since 1997. Our students have achieved success in professional placements, and we have a dynamic interdisciplinary research enterprise. The faculty has performed nationally recognized work in competitive, externall y funded centers. We are the only CEPH -accredited school in the country with CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) on its campus. Our CDC -supported Prevention Research Center was funded in 2019 for an additional 5- years. Working together, and with the involvement and input from faculty, staff, students, external stakeholders and consultants, an intensive self -study process was undertaken. This historical process revealed a number of key findings that provided the basis for development under the leadership of our current Dean, Dr. Jeffrey H. Coben, the Senior Associate Dean for Academic, Faculty, and Student Affairs, Dr. Linda A. Alexander, and the Senior Associate Dean for Administration, Dr. Sarah Woodrum. 2) Organizational charts that clearly depict the following related to the school: a. the school's internal organization, including the reporting lines to the D ean (Intro Figure 1 - page 4.

Undergraduate program : Degree requirements are established by the faculty, academic affairs , and curriculum committees based on accreditation requirements, and are regulated by the University. Both the Academic Affairs Curriculum C ommittee s ensure that program design complies with appropriate accreditation mandates. b. curriculum design Graduate programs : Revisions to curriculum are developed by the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Dir ector of Doctoral Programs, Director of the MPH Program, and the MS Program coordinator, all of whom serve on the Academic Affairs Committee . Final drafts of curriculum design are routed thorough the Course Inventory Management (CIM) system, Dean's Council, Academic Affairs , and the Curriculum Committee for review, alteration and final approval. Undergraduate program : Revisions to curriculum are developed by the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Studies, who is informed by information and data collected from a variety of sources (faculty, students, stakeholders, publications, etc.). Final drafts of curriculum design are routed t horough the Course Inventory Management (CIM) system, Dean's Council, Academic Affairs , and the Curriculum Committee for review, alteration and final approval. Figure 5: SPH Curricular Decision Flowchart (Course or Program Discussion) Faculty Member(s), Department Chair(s), Program Director(s), Dean's Council SPH Curriculum Committee Sr. Associate Dean for Academic Affairs17 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH c. student assessment policies and processes All student assessment policies and process are governed by the Academic Affairs committee, Evaluation Committee, Practice -Based Experience and Integrated Learning Committee, Academic and Professional Standards C ommittee with oversight by the Director of C areer Development and Student Success. d. admissions policies and/or decisions Graduate programs : MPH students are admitted at the department level by the department chair in conjunction with a designated faculty representative. Doctoral students are admitted by the department chairs of our three PhD concentrations. Other Master's level programs are governed by their respective program coordinators. Undergraduate program : The undergraduate program directly admits first -time freshmen and external transfer students (from other academic institutions) if they meet the minimum requirements; this is implemented by WVU Admissions and Recruitment. Current WVU students in other academic programs can transfer into the P ublic Health program if they meet the minimum academic requirements. Changes to these procedures would be vetted in the Academic Affairs and Curriculum committees. All admissions decisions are governed by the Director of Admissions who serves on the Academic Affairs Committee . Appeals to adm issions decisions would be reviewed by members of the Diversity Task Force and in the case of less than minimal qualifications for admission appeals would be made to the Academic and Professional Standards Committee. e. faculty recruitment and promotion Faculty Recruitment : Department search committees, assembled by the chairs on an ad hoc basis, normally handle faculty recruitment for positions within the respective departments. The search committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper procedures (as stipulated by the University ) are followed in the search and hiring process. All search committees include a designated social justice representative who is responsible for assuring compliance with the University's affirmative action protocol. Whenever possible search comm ittees include external partners, internal and external stakeholders , and student representatives. All committee members interview applicants, make recommendations, and have voting rights on the committee. All search committees make recommendations to the Dean, who serves as the ultimate hiring official. Faculty Promotion: Procedures for faculty retention, promotion, and tenure follow (please see document A1-2 in the ERF to review the SPH Promotion and Tenure guidelines ). Annual evaluation and review at the department level is by a committee of faculty peers. WVU rules permit a \"small school\" approach; one committee with representatives from each department serves this function within the SPH ( described in the Promotion and Tenure committee table above). Chairs also evaluate each faculty within a department. In addition, chairs provide annual 18 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH goals, in consultation with the faculty member, and the committee acknowledges and evaluates progress toward these goals in the next annual review. f. research and service activities The Research Committee is responsible for assuring that all grantees follow the University level prescribed guidance for matters such as cost sharing and indirect revenue. The committee reviews and makes recommendations to the dean regarding research procedures and programs at the S chool . Required grant compliance is discussed during Dean's Council and/or Academic Affairs. The School's promotion and tenure guidelines state that all faculty members are expected to demonstrate contributions in research, teaching, and service. How these expectations are translated into measurable and assessable activities are determined by each department. Annually, each chair and faculty member work together to develop a set of expectations and effort allocations in research, teaching and service. These work plans are included in the faculty member's file and shared with the members of the Promotion and Tenure Committee, to ensure that annual reviews of performance are evaluated against the agreed- upon expectations.

The Faculty Senate Inclusion and Diversity Committee (IDC) is charged with undertaking the following set of actions: Assess and issue a U niversity -wide report on the campus culture of inclusion, equity, and diversity to be carried out according to best practices but not less than every five years; Provide material, curricular support, and guidance, including an online toolkit, for faculty teaching and service related to diversity, equity, and inclusion; Establish and hold ongoing conversations with key units and stakeholders including but not limited to the D ivision of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, the Center for Excellence in Disabilities, the Center for Black Culture and Research, the ADVANCE program, the LGBTQ+ Center, the Office of Multicultural A ffairs and external community leaders and stake holder groups that work to further social justice and inclusion in West Virginia; Evaluate periodically national trends and report on best practices related to diversity and inclusion, and make recommendations to appropriate University bodies including the Office of the Provost, the Teaching and Learning Commons, and other Centers, Colleges, Schools and programs affiliated with the University; Report on systems and mechanism that provide support to faculty who engage in research and scholarship on issues related to social status including but not limited to race, ethnicity, income, gender, sexuality, and religion; Address in a timely fashion other issues pertinent to the charge of the committee. WVU Graduate C ouncil: Alfgeir Kristjansson, voting member The charge of the Graduate Council is to (1) formulate and recommend policy for graduate study at West Virginia University and (2) assist in the oversight of graduate programs, including coordinating periodic rev iews. HSC Women in Science and Health Committee, Professional Development: Linda Alexander, Co-chair The Women In Science & Health Committee (WISH) was established with the following charge: To enhance the advancement of women through professional development programs. Establishing an effective network of women faculty. Assessing the current status of women faculty in terms of academic rank, years of service and salary plus incentives. Developing and implementing a faculty mentoring program for women. WVU Institutional Review Board: Stephen Davis, Vice- chair of the Blue Board WVU has two IRBs, appointed by the Institutional Official (IO). The IRBs prospectively review and make decisions concerning all human research conducted at WVU facilities, by its employees or agents, or under its auspices. The IRB is responsible for the protection of rights and welfare of human research subjects at WVU. It discharges this duty by complying with the requirements of the Common Rule; state regulations; the FWA; and institutional policies. Please see document A1-4 in the ERF to view the list of University Committees represented by Public Health Faculty. 21 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 5) Describe how full -time and part -time faculty regularly interact with their colleagues (self -study document) and provide documentation of recent interactions, which may include minutes, attendee lists, etc. All full -time and part -time faculty are expected to receive training, guidance, expectations, University - level requirements, and academic policies and procedures regardless of their status as full or part time. All teaching faculty are included on correspondence pertaining to teaching updates such as those described above. Additionally, all teaching faculty, regardless of status are included in social occasions, All -Hands Meetings, invitations to colloquia and training, and are considered part of the SPH family. Please see Section A1 (A1-5 examples) of the ERF. 6) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths : Faculty have the opportunity to be engaged in various levels of decision making at the SPH. Our values as a community dictate that full and part time faculty not be treated differently and have full benefit of the resources and support of the SPH when appropriate. Weaknesses: We have not historically tracked participation at many events and activities that would demonstrate the engagement of full - and part-time faculty. In the f all of 2018, we provided direction to Departmental Administrative Assistants to ensure adequate documentation of meetings. Additionally, the Senior Associate Dean for Administration has formall y assigned an administrator to all committees . In the absence of someone to keep meeting minutes we have encouraged the use of recorders. Plans: Moving forward the SPH will develop meeting templates and an online system that they can upload their documents centrally . 22 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 23 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH A2. Multi -Partner Schools The school has a single identified leader (dean or director) and a cohesive chain of authority for all decision making relevant to the educational school that culminates with this individual. 1) Describe the major rights and responsibilities of each participating institution. 2) A copy of the formal written agreement that establishes the rights and obligations of the participating universities in regard to the school's operation. 3) Describe the role and responsibilities of the identified leader. 4) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. This criterion is not applicable. 24 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 25 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH A3. Student Engagement Students have formal methods to participate in policymaking and decision making within the school, and the school engages students as members on decision- making bodies whenever appropriate. 1) Describe student participation in policymaking and decision making at the school level, including identification of all student members of school committees over the last three years, and student organizations involved in school governance. Schools should focus this discussion on students in public health degree programs. School -Level Participation WVU SPH students play an active role in policymaking and decisions affecting the school on all levels. Student leadership is ultimately governed through the Office of Academic and Student Affairs, which oversees all student organizations within the School . Student representatives serve on all standing and administrative committees , as appropriate, with the exception of the Promotion and Tenure and PhD Advisory C ommittee(s). S tudents serve as full members and are equal to other committee members with regard to input, decision- making, and voting. Students who serve on standing committees are charged with reporting to the student body the activities and decisions of all committees , via SAPH meetings and the Student E-News. Students are also involved in faculty and staff leadership position searches , as appropriate. During the most recent Strategic Planning Process, students were actively invited to provide commentary through Q ualtrics surveys at each step of the process. Additionally, student feedback has been a key piece of our process through on-campus meetings, their respective roles on standing committees, and incentivized by instructors who gave \"extra credit\" for student participation. Student s will continue to be involved as the School continues to grow. Feedback from the student body is vital to the direction of the S chool . One of the more prominent and visible methods of student participation is the Student Association of Public Health (S APH). Per the SAPH mission statement, they \"serve as a liaison between all students in the West Virginia University School of Public Health Educational Programs and the program faculty and staff.\" SAPH often engages, and invites S chool leadership, i.e. the Dean and Senior Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, to at least one meeting per year for a discussion of current/future student needs. Additionally, student focus groups have been utilized to solicit feedback for curricula refresh/redesigns at the mas ters and doctoral levels. Upon graduation, all students receive an exit survey from the SPH to ask about their satisfaction with the program they completed. As part of that survey, students are given open- ended questions to solicit thoughts on what t hey w ould like to see revised, how the School's infrastructure could be more responsive to student needs, and insights regarding the transparency of S chool leadership. Committee Participation Dean's Council: Beginning in the 2018/2019 academic year, the elect ed President of the Student Association of Public Health has been appointed to Dean's Council to serve as the liaison between Dean's Council and the student body via the Student Association of Public Health. Students serve one-year appointments during the time they hold their SAPH leadership position. Academic Year Student 2019 -20 Mohini Chatterji, MPH student ( SAPH President ) 2018 -19 Laurent Ferrell, MPH student (SAPH President) 2017 -18 No Student Representative 26 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Academic Affairs Committee: Beginning in the 2018/2019 academic year, the elected Vice President of the Student Association of Public Health has been appointed to the Academic Affairs Committee to serve as the liaison between the Academic Affairs and the student body via the Student Association of Public Health. Students serve one- year appointments during the time they hold their SAPH leadership position. Academic Year Student 2019 -20 Kruti Pandya, MPH student ( SAPH Vice President ) 2018 -19 Katie Cranmer, MPH student (SAPH Vice President) 2017 -18 No Student Representative Curriculum Committee: During the first formal meeting of the academic year, the Chair of the Curriculum committee seeks recommendations for students from members of the committee. The preference is to select a PhD student who is more familiar with curricular needs. Academic Year Student 2019 -20 Brenna Kirk , PhD student 2018 -19 Stephen Heck, PhD student 2017 -18 No Student Representative 2) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths : Student run elections for leadership positions for two organizations (Delta Omega and Student Association of Public Health). Leadership positions are open to students from all SPH degree programs. Weakness: Faculty have always championed the involvement of students as a part of the decision making in the S chool . As faculty have had oversight for committees and projects they have solicited participation from their students. During periods of administrative transition, maintaining and monitoring these ap pointments has been difficult. Until the arrival of the Director of Career Services and Student Success, there was no formal process for the appointment of students on committees. Mr. Scot McIntos h was hired in this role and has oversight for alumni, student committees, and student academic programs, and began instituting formal processes in July 2017. Plan s: Continue working on language for appointing SPH students to more standing committees within the School , where appropriate. Formalize a nomination and election process to have representatives from the bachelors, masters, and doctoral levels. 27 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH A4. Autonomy for Schools of Public Health A school of public health operates at the highest level of organizational status and independence available within the university context. If there are other professional schools in the same university (e.g., medicine, nursing, law, etc.), the school of public health shall have the same degree of independence accorded to those professional schools. Independence and status are viewed within the context of institutional policies, procedures and practices. 1) Briefly describe the school's reporting lines up to the institution's chief executive officer. The response may refer to the organizational chart provided in the introduction. The Dean of the S PH reports to the Vice President and Executive Dean for Health Sciences of West Virginia University. The V ice President and Executive Dean for Health Sciences report s to the President of the U niversity . Please see Section A4- 1 of the ERF for the organizational chart. The Vice President of Health Sciences and Executive Dean of the Medical School is a five- year renewable appointed position. However, as Vice President of WVU Health Sciences and the hiring official for all Health Science Center Deans, Dr. Clay Marsh does have the authority to separate the two positions and hire a Dean of Medicine if he felt that it was in the best interest of the School. As Vice President, Dr. Marsh serves as the chief academic and administrative officer with fiduciary, administrative, accreditation responsibility and oversight of all Health Sciences schools, divisions, programs, and activities, which includes but is not limited to the Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, the Charleston and Eastern Medical Divisions, and the Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center. In Dr. Marsh's role as Executive Dean of the School of Medicine, he serves as the chief academic officer with major responsibilities including undergraduate medical education, graduate medical education, professional programs, faculty recruitment/retention, promotion and tenure, leadership development, strategic planning, new program development, and finance. In addition, Dr. Marsh also plays a pivotal role within the clinical enterprise, WVU Medicine, providing visionary leadership of the signature programs including Cancer, Heart & Vascular, Neurosciences, Women & Children, and Critical Care & Trauma. 2) Describe the reporting lines and levels of autonomy of other professional schools located in the same institution and identify any differences between the school of public health's reporting lines/level of autonomy and those of other units. The Dean of the S PH has the same reporting relationship and level of independence as all other deans of the schools housed within the H SC all of whom report directly to the Vice President for HSC. On a routine basis, t he Dean meets individually with the Vice President of the HSC , and attends twice - monthly H SC Leadership meetings , which includes all HSC S chool Deans and other executive leadership. The S PH operates at the highest level of organizational status and independence available within the University framework. The SPH Dean also attends monthly U niversity -wide Dean's meetings chaired by the WVU Provost. The primary purpose of the Provost's meeting is to provide direction and facilitate collaboration among the colleges and schools. The Provost also has overall authority for all WVU academic progra ms; with 28 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH the SPH and other HSC schools operating under the WVU graduate and undergraduate policies and procedures in addition to those specific to the HSC. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: The strength of this organizational structure center is that the Dean of the SPH has great visibility within the HSC and within the University . He/she has the ability to escalate issues to the highest level and make sure that important issues/challengers stay front and center. Weaknesses: There do es not appear to be weaknesses in this model. Plans: N/A 29 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH A5. Degree Offerings in Schools of Public Health A school of public health offers a professional public health master's degree (e.g., MPH) in at least three distinct concentrations (as defined by competencies in Criterion D4) and public health doctoral degree programs (academic or professional) in at least two concentrations (as defined by competencies in Criterion D4). A school may offer more degrees or concentrations at either degree level. 1) Affirm that the school offers professional public health master's degree concentrations in at least three areas and public health doctoral degree programs of study in at least two areas. Temp late Intro-1 may be referenced for this purpose. The MPH is offered in five concentrations (Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Health Policy, Management & Leadership, Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, and Social & Behavioral Sciences) and the PhD in three concentrations (Epidemiology, Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, and Social & Behavioral Sciences). Degree offerings are summarized in Table Intro-1. (See Table Intro 1: Instructional Matrix on page 9 or in section A5 of the ERF .) An official catalog or bulletin that lists the degrees offered by the school. The official catalog for the undergraduate program can found at: http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/schoolofpublichealth/#text The official catalog for the graduate programs can be found at : http://catalog.wvu.edu/graduate/publichealth/ 30 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 31 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH B1. Guidi ng Statements The school defines a vision that describes how the community/world will be different if the school achieves its aims. The school defines a mission statement that identifies what the school will accomplish operationally in its instructional, community engagement and scholarly activities. The mission may also define the school's setting or community and priority population(s). The school defines goals that desc ribe strategies to accomplish the defined mission. The school defines a statement of values that informs stakeholders about its core principles, beliefs and priorities. 1) A one- to three- page document that, at a minimum, presents the school's vision, mission, goals and values. WVU SPH is engaged in an active transition phase as part of a renewed strategic emphasis. The School's first five -year strategic plan (Strategic Plan 2020 (SP2020) is available to view in section B1 of the ERF) was finalized as part of a collaborative input process in 2014. The School has operated with the guiding statements from the 2020 plan since the last CEPH -self-study period. However, a major le adership change in the SPH, the advent of the first graduating class in the newly added baccalaureate degree, the planned addition of a Masters in Health Administration (MHA) and significant collaborative relationships with external stakeholders dictated t he need to reexamine the 2020 Strategic Plan. Our School embarked on a new process in 2019 to revise/clarify the SP2020 guiding statements, reduce redundancy in strategic aims, and more accurately define the future direction of the SPH. This renewed process was timely given the sunsetting of the original plan. One progressive result of the recent strategic planning process was overwhelmingly consistent feedback suggesting a need for a more refined mission and accurate vision for the school. Since April 2019, the School has operated under and been guided by the following mission, vision and values: The MISSION of the West Virginia University School of Public Health is to improve the quality of life for West Virginians and all who call Appalachia home. The VISION of the West Virginia University School of Public Health is to attain healthy people in thriving communities. Values The School of Public Health is guided by the following values: Community Engagement : we are proud of the communities we serve, and recognize the importance of bidirectional participatory activities. Collaboration: we collaborate with partners who join us in improving the public's health. Equity : we promote equity and social justice in defining health and eliminating health dispariti es. Integrity : we adhere to the highest ethical standards of honesty and fairness and we recognize that integrity and ethical behavior are essential elements of our professions. Respect : we respect diverse points of view and the cultural heritage and traditions of all people. Accountability : we hold ourselves accountable to one another and to the many stakeholders who support the School of Public Health. 32 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Transitioning from Strategic Plan 2020 to the Strategic Compass. The School of Public Health's Strategic Plan 2020 was reviewed and discussed at an introductory planning meeting convened by Dean Coben in October 2018. While much of the language contained within the original strategic plan remained relevant, many of the goals and initiatives were modified and/or updated to reflect the contemporary structure of the School of Public Health. There also existed the need to clarify the relevance of the School to the state of West Virginia. After the initial meeting in Fall 2018 , a strategic planning committee comprised of collaborative partners, faculty, and staff was identified with input from the Dean. This group conducted a SWOT analysis to gather the necessary data to reformulate t he original strategic plan. Using this for m of assessment , we were able to collect both quantitative and qualitative information from internal and external stakeholders. Faculty, staff, students and stakeholders were queried utilizing Qualtrics Survey methods and continuously involved and encourag ed to participate in each step of the process. Feedback was evaluated and shared at each of our subsequent planning committee meetings to assist in the decision- making process. The process used to transition to a revised plan of action was completed in Apr il of 2019 and described in detail via P ower -Point containing milestones and feedback results (located in B1 of the electronic resource file) . The SPH Planning Steering Committee has transitioned to a permanent steering committee that will provide oversight for actions moving forward. In addition to a steering committee for oversight we formed what we refer to as Priority Action Teams that include both internal and external stakeholders. These diverse constituent groups were tasked with the development of a measurement plan - including the identification of targets, actions, projects, and initiatives that support strategic priorities. Our pl an for the action teams is linked to the school's requirement for continual evaluation and updates to the strategic plan, and to ensure that goals and priorities are realized in a timely and measurable manner. At this time, the priority action teams have developed and recommended measurement and implementation plans for review by the p ermanent steering committee and ultimately final approval from the Dean of the School of Public Health. Ongoing meetings are scheduled to begin in early -mid April 2020.

Ensuring student representatives are identified from each degree program (BSPH, MS, MPH, and PHD). o Identify and incorporate Career Services programming/assignment into at least one SPH course at each degree level (BSPH, MS/MPH, PHD) that will require students to interface with Career Services. (PUBH200, PUBH610, etc.) . Goal Statement: Foster success by building on the unique strengths of today's students. o Increase the number of programs and establish baseline par ticipation for events that are recorded and placed online for students. This caters to the large number of our students who can't attend events or group meetings due to work/family commitments. o Grow SPH Ambassador Program. Increase participation at the PhD level by adding more PhD ambassadors. Would also like to add additional spots for MPH and MS Students. Would like to have the UG ambassadors attend some high schools and present on the Public Health Field and Major. Goal Statement: Promote growth and development of vibrant student and alumni associations. o Connect students and alumni more regularly outside of the classroom. Start with the Inclusion of a student representative(s) on the Alumni Leadership Council to tie the groups together. Representative should hold liaison/officer role from either SAPH or Delta Omega. Increase digital footprint as means of communication for the networks (i.e. Instagram - A day in the life of an Alumnus/a/Student). 35 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH o Student satisfaction with opportunities provided by student groups (internally facing, campus/community facing) and the reach of their organization (semester survey sent to student body - include list of events and activities) . o Expand and offer more Alumni Virtual Networking Sessions (via ZOOM, Skype). Allows the group to connect, online, during the lunch hour. Meaningful Collaborations Goal Statement: Develop meaningful partnerships (WV DHHR, health systems, other) and seek new opportunities to deliver public health benefits. o Increase formal working relationships (WV DHHR for example) by 10% year 1, and 5% year 2 and year 3. o Promote and support student involvement in outreach and community service activities . Goal Statement: Integrate community, state, and university initiatives that strive to improve interrelating determinants of health. o Integrate community, state, and university initiatives that strive to improve interrelating determinants of health into high- impact pedagogically inclusive teaching methods . o Support activities that outreach to the citizens of West Virginia and address community needs . o Percentage of full -time faculty members demonstrating involvement in community based funded projects.

Please see section B1of the ERF for: SPH Strategic Compass (Revised Guiding Statements) SPH Planning Process ( PowerPoint ) SPH Strategic Task Force Inaugural Meeting 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths : The development of the 2020 Strategic Plan was a collaborative process that engaged SPH constituents, stakeholders, collaborative partners, faculty, staff, students and alumni. Weaknesses: In 2018 , the SPH acknowledged that the 2020 Strategic Plan was written under different HSC leadership, did not incl ude our newly added baccalaureate degree, and did not fully articulate our focus as the only CEPH -accredited S PH in West Virginia. Plans: A renewed focus on measurable objectives/goals has been developed through a 6- month strategic visioning exercise. This process included various external and internal partners and resulted in a strategic compass to guide the direction of our future. In addition, the S chool has developed a robust process to operationalize the priorities and goals that were articulated in t he strategic compass - turning strategic goals into action. 37 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH B2. Graduation Rates The school collects and analyzes graduation rate data for each public health degree offered ( e.g., BS, MPH, MS, PhD, DrPH). The school achieves graduation rates of 70% or greater for bachelor's and master's degrees and 60% or greater for doctoral degrees. 1) Graduation rate data for each degree in unit of accreditation.

The status of undergraduate students is changed after one semester of nonattendance. The status of graduate students must be changed by their program before they are marked as inactive and is recorded at the discretion of their academic advisor. No justification is required when student's status is changed. Once a student is recorded as 41 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH inactive, they are no longer recorded and reported by The Office of Institutional Research at West Virginia University per the West Virginia - Higher Education Policy Commission specifications. These reporting practi ces prevent us from knowing which students go inactive until the following year when they are no longer recorded in the files. 2) Data on doctoral student progression in the format of Template B2- 2.

PhD program : The WVU SPH is allocated 10 slots for funding PhD students per year from the HSC . These slots include a tuition waiver and monthly stipend. Under normal circumstances this funding is allocated to 1st and 2nd year PhD students, while they conduct their course work. During the 2019 - 2020 academic calendar year, 10 students were offered slot s in the program, 9 accepted the offer (line 2). Overall , 30 students are currently enrolled into the program (line 3). Sixteen students completed their course work during the 2018- 2019 academic year, advancing to the qualifying exam , and then into candidacy with a matched mentor that typical ly funds their stipend during their independent research phase (line 4). Ten students were in candidacy during the 2018- 2019 academic year and had passe d their qualifying exam. Finally, five students graduated from the WVU PhD Public Health program during the academic year. MPH/MS program : Standards met Undergraduate program : Standards met 4) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths : SPH PhD admissions policy is based on the goal to have full -time students fully funded until graduation. The program's curriculum offerings, mentoring and advising all support this goal. 42 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH By accepting transfer students, the BSPH program already has graduates, despite the fact that it is less than four years old. Weaknesses: Two pos sible reason that contribute to the PhD program falling below a 60% graduation rate are 1) working professionals enrolled as a part-time student or 2) unclear framework, on our behalf, which we have been addressing by tightening the funding promise timeline in the contract letters and monitoring student progress more closely. Plan s: PhD program - Conduct annual progress reviews (spring semester ) and meet with the student and department chair when progress is deemed inadequate. 43 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH B3. Post -Graduation Outcome s The school collects and analyzes data on graduates' employment or enrollment in further education post-graduation, for each public health degree offered ( e.g., BS, MPH, MS, PhD, DrPH). The school achieves rates of 80% or greater employment or enrollment in further education within the defined time period for each degree. 1) Data on post -graduation outcomes (employment or enrollment in further education) for each degree. See Template B3- 1. Table B3 -1.1: Post-Graduation Outcomes (not employed) N/A N/A 6 (21%) Not seeking employment or not seeking additional education by choice N/A N/A 1 (4%) Actively seeking employment or enrollment in further education N/A N/A 0 (0%) Unknown N/A N/A 5 2017/2018 Employed 34 (81%) 18 (66.7%) 20 (74%) Continuing education/training (not employed) 4 (10%) 5 (18.5%) 3 (11%) Not seeking employment or not seeking additional education by choice 1 (2%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Actively seeking employment or enrollment in further education 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 1 (4%) Unknown 3 (7%) 4 (14.8%) 3 (11%) Total graduates (known + unknown) (100%) 27 (100%) (100%) Table 2017/2018 Employed 13 (100%) 12 (92%) 9 (82%) Continuing education/training (not employed) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Not seeking employment or not seeking additional education by choice 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Actively seeking employment or enrollment in further education 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Unknown 0 (0%) 1 (8%) 2 (18%) Total graduates (known + unknown) 13 (100%) 13 (100%) 11 (100%) 44 WVU SCHOOL OF Table Outcomes 2017/2018 Employed 3 (100%) 7 (100%) 10 education/training (not employed) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0% (0%) Not seeking employment or not seeking additional education by choice 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0% (0%) Actively seeking employment or enrollment in further education 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0% (0%) Unknown 0 (0%) 0 (known + unknown) 3 (100%) 7 (100%) 10 (100%) 2) Explain the data presented above, including identification of factors contributing to any rates that do not meet this criterion's expectations and plans to address these factors. At graduation, for each program, the Director of Career Development and Student Success initiates the process of identifying outcomes for SPH graduates. All SPH students who file an application to graduate with the university receive a brief Career Services Exit Survey. The survey asks students to provide updated contact information and a few questions about how they utilized Career Services as a student. Additionally, students are asked to identify their current status from a list that includes the following options: Actively seeking employment Furthering my education or traini ng Not seeking employment at this time I am working in my current job and seeking other employment now that I have my Public Health degree Employed in an area related to my degree Employed, but not in an area related to my degree Students are then asked to provide details about employment and/or further education. One year after graduation, the Director of Career Development and Student Success follows up with graduates with a more in- depth Alumni Outcomes Survey to gather updated information on graduates and to identify information about salaries, sectors of employment, degree debt, etc. The survey is sent with to graduates at least three times. If alumni do not respond to the survey, the Director of Career Development and Student Success begins calling alumni who have unknown outcomes to ask for updates and to offer assistance with any needs. He also utilizes LinkedIn search and social media searches as part of the process. The MPH, MS, and PhD programs have consistently exceeded the 80% rate, with a 100% career placement rate for our last three PhD cohorts. The BSPH cohort listed has a placement rate of 78% with an additional 18% unknown data. Data collection for that BSPH cohort is ongoing and is being collected by the School's Director of Career Development and Student Success. The data collection process for the 2017/2018 cohort was formally initiated in July 2019 after the graduates had a full year post-graduation to identify their next steps. It is highly likely the rate will exceed 80% for t he BSPH students by the time the cohort data is formally reported to ASPPH in November 2019. 45 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: Our graduate programs consistently ex ceed the threshold for employment. Weaknesses: The newness of our BSPH program lends itself to a lack of career placement data for this population. Plans: The Director of Career Development & Student Success has been assigned as the instructor of recor d for a career focused undergraduate course (PUBH 200 - Intro to Public Health Careers and Information). The course is required for all undergraduate students and the instructor has built assignments into the course that will assist with future tracking of post -graduation outcomes. For instance, all students must create a LinkedIn profile for credit. They must connect with the Director of Career Development & Student Success and all of their peers in their course section. Additionally, they are required to join a course specific LinkedIn group for additional tracking. 46 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 47 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH B4. Alumni Perceptions of Curricular Effectiveness For each public health degree offered, the school collects information on alumni perceptions of their own success in achieving defined competencies and of their ability to apply these competencies in their post -graduation placements. The school defines qualitative and/or quantitative methods designed to maximize response rates and provide useful information. Data from recent graduates within the last five years are typically most useful, as distal graduates may not have completed the curriculum that is currently offered. 1) Summarize the findings of alumni self -assessment of success in achieving competencies and ability to apply competencies after graduation. In spring 2019 , the Director of Assessment and the Director of Career Development and Student Success worked on the development of a comprehensive alumni survey to capture data relevant to program competencies and the new CEPH criteria. Valuable feedback from alumni who entered the program prior to the revised curriculum was solicited in March, May and October of 2017, respectively ( see agenda and conversation threads in section B4- 1 of the ERF). During a focus group session at an alumni breakfast, participants were asked about their preparation for the workforce and to comment on the 2016 MPH curriculum criteria in the context of their experience. In follow -up meetings, alumni were asked specifically about their practice -based experiences and overall MPH experiences as part of preparation for their current positions. Qualitative feedback from both of these sessions revealed the following summary comments: More preparation needed in grant writing and profess ional writing More opportunities to practice professional speaking Practicum experience was a direct link to current position Career development and job readiness skills are a must More training in SAS and SPSS An additional outcome from active alumni part icipation and involvement in the S PH during the 2016- 2018 years was the desire for an Alumni Mentoring Program (see section B4- 1 of the ERF) . Previously, alumni have indicated that formal or informal mentoring is likely to enhance students' ability to maxi mize the effectiveness in applying coursework and harnessing this knowledge into job readiness skills. Currently, m entoring events are dependent on student interest and will continue to be encouraged by the new Director of Alumni Affairs. Doctoral Students in our program are required to have teaching experience and a first authored publication prior to graduation. Consistent feedback from graduates of our three doctoral concentrations since 2017, through their mentors and the Director of Doctoral Programs , indicates that both of these requirements have prepared them for job readiness. The current doctoral program is being revised to better integrate the MPH core as a foundation for those who enter our program without an MPH degree and a common core based on skills rather than discipline specific content. Graduates of this program will be surveyed in the future to determine job readiness based on revisions to the curriculum. The SPH graduated our first undergraduate students in December 2017. These December graduates , along with the next two years of graduates , transferred from other Health Sciences programs at WVU (i.e. nursing, physical therapy, rehabilitative sciences) and thus did not have the benefit our full BSPH curriculum. The 2019 cohort will be the f irst to enter, as freshmen, and to be surv eyed after graduation. 48 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2) Provide full documentation of the methodology and findings from alumni data collection. See data in the B4- 2 section of the ERF . 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: The School has a strong track record (2014 - present) of continuous solicitation of feedback from alumni regarding curricula effect iveness. Our current leadership in assessment and program effectiveness constitutes regular alumni contact and feedback from the Director of Career Development and Student Success, the Director of Assessment, Program Directors, and a formal alumni council now led by Scot McIntosh. Weaknesses: Consistency in the survey method/instrument and the individual who communicates the survey to alumni has led to a lack of access to historical data that was collected by previous employees of the SPH. As such, response rates are not available for older surveys that were conducted digitally. Plan s: The Director of Assessment and the Director of Career Development developed the SPH Alumni Program Review Survey. The survey asks students to assess how successful they hav e been in applying foundational public health competencies to their current job. Students are asked to provide direct examples, via open response questions, of instances they have implemented their knowledge in practice. They are also asked to share how the program they completed can best be improved. The first iteration of that survey is currently active and has been sent to SPH Alumni dating back to 2015. Preliminary data from that group is expected to be available at the completion of the Spring 2020 semester. Going forward, the SPH Alumni Program Review Survey will be administered bi - annually and will seek to gather data from the SPH's two most recent graduating classes from the date of survey administration. A copy of SPH Alumni Program Review Sur vey can be found in the B4 ERF. 49 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH B5. Defining Evaluation Practices The school defines appropriate evaluation methods and measures that allow the school to determine its effectiveness in advancing its mission and goals. The evaluation plan is ongoing, systematic and well-documented.

The West Virginia University School of publ ic health has transitioned from an accredited program housed as a unit within Community Medicine to a nationally recognized CEPH -accredited school in less than six (6) years. During the period prior to this reaccreditation phase, impactful decisions in program and curricula design, academic instruction, advising, student recruitment, retention, career development have been data driven. This evaluation process and decision making also holds true for the three- year period encapsulated in the Final Self -Study. Our data traditionally came from internal sources (i.e. surveys) but importantly, also included ongoing and continuous feedback from external stakeholder involvement and ongoing relationships with significant health agency partners and the state's policy makers. Data collected as a result of the Strategic Priority Groups will continue to come from agency partners and policy makers. Employer -based, alumni, and student surveys are collected annually, and those from 2014 to 2017 were utilized to create the current infrastructure for the integration of academic and student affairs. National data reflecting employment trends, ongoing working meetings with WVU Medicine, Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR), the WV Bureau of Public Health, Kanawha Charleston Health Department, Monongalia County Health Department, and the CDC National Institutes of Health (NIOSH) have been continually utilized to shape course and curricula offerings. Specifically, working and consultation meetings with internal and external partners and national employment trend data resulted in the following program changes directly linked to impact in the public health workforce: Patient Navigation Area of Concentration (AOE) as part of the BSPH program (2016) Master in Health Administ ration (MHA), developed in direct response to a request by WVU Medicine to better train physicians for leadership roles) BS in Health Services in Management and Leadership (HSML) (launching Fall 2020). Climate Surveys, Student Evaluation of Instruction ( SEI's) and Academic Advising Surveys, are administered annually, through the Offices of Institutional Research, WVU Division of Talent and 54 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Culture, Office of Graduate Education and Life, WVU Undergraduate Studies, and Teaching and Learning Commons. Results from these surveys are utilized to inform teaching assignments, plan activities linked to our institutional values, and request resources and support for undergraduate and graduate program advising. Faculty and Staff satisfaction surveys are administered through and external consultant. Feedback is used to inform decisions for support and resources to enhance and/or maintain faculty and staff satisfaction, morale, and retention. The School maintains an on- going feedback loop with information from data through several channels of communication and opportunities for open dialogue. Dean's Council, Council of Chairs, and Senior Leadership meetings are designed as forums to handle sensitive feedback due to both the nature of information and the time line necessary for a response. General information from data sources, including qualitative feedback, is provided as part of All Hands Meetings (Winnable Battles, Restructuring of MPH, Introducing Program Directors, Introducing MHA, NIOSH Scholar in Residence) . Academ ic Affairs Committee Meetings, Departmental -level meetings, and Alumni and Leadership Council meetings. 3) Provide evidence of implementation of the plan described in Template B5- 1. Evidence may include reports or data summaries prepared for review, minutes of meetings at which results were discussed, etc. Evidence must document examination of progress and impact on both public health as a field and student success. The electronic resource file contains documentation of the various meetings and forums at wh ich these evaluation methods and measures we re discussed . Please see Section B5 of the electronic resource file. 4) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths : Strong collaborative relationships with external partners have resulted in the School's responsiveness to needs designed to grow and enhance the current public health workforce. The University -based queries provide yearly feedback to inform program design. Weaknesses: We have suffered from low -participation rates for school -wide surveys due to students' feelings of a lack of anonymity in responses and due in part to the uniqueness of the SPH in relation to the needs of the other four Health Sciences progra ms. The latter refers to questions on standardized institutional surveys that clearly are not relevant for students in our program. For example, the majority of questions on the HSC driven surveys reflect the other four (4) health professions students' stu dy options, course sequencing, resident training, exam options, learning obstacles. Plans: We have begun plans to make surveys more relevant to the day -to-day functions of the SPH, and have requested that questions be added to centrally administered surveys to capture the organizational make- up, culture, climate and environment of the School . We are awaiting results/decisions regarding a climate survey to capture data on the S chool's values of diversity and inclusion, integrity, respect, civility, and envi ronment for faculty, students, and staff. 55 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH B6. Use of Evaluation Data The school engages in regular, substantive review of all evaluation findings, as well as strategic discussions about the implications of evaluation findings. The school implements an explicit process for translating evaluation findings into programmatic plans and changes and provides evidence of changes implemented based on evaluation findings. 1) Provide two to four specific examples of programmatic changes under taken in the last three years based on evaluation results. For each example, describe the specific evaluation finding and the groups or individuals responsible for determining the planned change, as well as identifying the change itself. The two examples highlighted are those that reflect programmatic changes undertaken in the last three years based on evaluation results gathered as part of the original strategic plan for 2020 and operationalized in 2016 and 2017: Example # 1 - Integration of Academic and Student Affairs Prior to Fall 2016 the Office of St udent Affairs operated in a silo from Academic Affairs, with little structured input from departmental faculty, department chairs, or school leadership with the exception of the provision of routine updat es and announcements. Exit surveys, a dvising satisfaction surveys , and qualitative findings from focus groups with faculty, staff, students, and alumni were used to determine dissatisfaction with the academic experience. During the remainder of the 2016- 2017 academic year, the newly appointed Associate Dean of Academic Affairs launched a deep dive into the management of the School's academic process and procedures, student affairs staff's job performance, position appropriateness, and job readiness. During this same period, identification of anticipated changes in CEPH criteria and readiness for articulating those changes within the Office of Student Affairs was determined. Finally, a significant period was devoted to a better comprehension of the delineat ion of duties in the Office of Academic and Student Affairs. To facilitate open dialogue in a safe space with the staff in the Office of Student Affairs and academic leaders an external consultant was engaged. The findings from the Office of Student Affairs and leaders was delivered to the Dean and the Dean's Counci l. Among the recommendation from the staff retreat was the immediate change to the infrastructure of academic and student affairs, including reporting lines, clearer expectations in job performance, and the request for an MPH and PhD Program Director. Addi tionally, the Dean invited leaders from the academic and student affairs offices, including department chairs and assistant Deans, to participate in a culture shaping retreat led by a nationally consultants which required participation over a 6- month period. Data from that retreat revealed a common desire to prioritize students and their academic experience at WVU SPH. Retreat experience and findings were discussed in Academic Affairs Committee and Dean's Council as part of debriefing and future plans to foster excellence in the student experience. Program Directors were appointed in 2017 and each launched a substantive review of the MPH and PhD program, respectively. Proposed changes to PhD and MPH advising, and the infrastructure for ensuring a more satisfying academic experience were vetted as part of the Academic Affairs Committees, Dean's Council and individual Chair meetings. Dr. Mike Mann, Director of the MPH from 2016 to 2018, analyzed the structures in place prior to the suggested changes and produced a systems change document to guide the implementation of the desired direction. 56 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH The Office of Academic and Student Affairs was created to model the suggested system changes after a series of open forums and meetings with all constituent groups. These systematic changes also resulted in the following: Appointment of the Assistant Dean of Public Health Practice Revisions to the job expectations for the Director of Practice Based Experience Creation of an MPH Advisor role for a long -time staff member in the Office of Student Services Revisions to the mandatory Student Orientation for all incoming students Hiring a n experienced admissions recruiter Creation of a committee focused on student retention and success Training for Department Administrative Assistants In summary, changes to the structure of academic and student affairs were made after a review of student and alumni surveys, qualitative data from student forums, two academic and student affairs retreats, job descriptions for student affairs staff, and a systems review of infrastructure needs that better aligned with desired changes in program delivery and advising support. The revisions to our academic structure provide the basis for two of our four current strategic visioning priorities aligned with goals for Student Centric and Inspiring Education. Students who entered the program in fall 2018 will be the first cohort to report on the benefit of the substantial infrastructure changes in the curricula and advising. However early indicators from annual surveys, individual advising with MPH, MS, and PhD students have been overwhelming positive. Undergraduates are new to our program and are having positive experiences with academic instruction and advising, however, a survey from the Undergraduate Advising Office suggests that we have additional opportunities for improvement . The Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Studies, respective program directors and the Senior Associate Dean for Academic, Faculty, and Student Affairs, conducts programs reviews annually. We utilized regularly planned advising workshops and retreats to review data and make changes as needed. (Evidence can be viewed in section B6, Example 1 folder, of the ERF ) Example #2 - Patient Navigator Area of Emphasis (AOE) The Bachelor's in Public Health degree was launched in 2016 with two primary focus areas, (1) the science of public health and (2) community health engagement. The idea for developing a Patient Navigator (PN) program was initially proposed by the Vice President of Quality and Patient Safety at WVU Hospitals, who saw the looming need for PNs at WVU Hospitals. At an October 1, 2016 p lanning meeting attended by representatives of both WVU Hospitals in Morgantown and the Eastern Division, the Associate Vice President and Dean of the School of Medicine- Eastern Division, indicated that it is \"particularly difficult to fit this training into other curricula, such as for registered nurses and social workers .\" The Medical Director of Performance Improvement at WVU Health Systems agreed saying \"the best role for these graduates would be as team extenders, expanding the reach of the clinically trained members of the team \". The Vice President of Quality and Patient Safety also indicated that \"health insurers are starting to work in this care coordinator/navigation field; another possible employer for BS in Public Health graduates as most of these coordinators/navigators are currently registered nurses, who could be better utilized elsewhere in the health care system.\" Based on identified need for PN's and the School's commitment to ensuring long -term careers for graduates from our program, the Dean convened meetings with the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Studies and senior academic leadership to brainstorm regarding approaches to adding a Patient Navigator Area of Emphasis (AOE). The first draft of the proposed program in 2016 has benefitted 57 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH from financial resources from the Dean's office, curricula changes in line with the state- of-the-field, and changes in program coordination to better align those with combined public health and hospital/healthcare experience. The PN AOE has reduced the number of course offerings to eliminate redundancy and incorporated a faculty -based program coordinator (Dr. Toni Morris). We now have a fully articulated program and since December 2019 we graduated nine students who have all been placed in jobs. In May 2020, seven students have applied for graduation and we anticipate positions for most of those students based on their respective practice sites. Through alumni interviews we have learned that the Patient Navigation skill sets have also translated well enough fo r students to be hired as data analysts and community health workers. Faculty with regular teaching assignments in our program support the Patient Navigator AOE. Other support for the program comes from the following highlighted examples: A faculty member in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, who is a registered nurse, coordinates this Area of Emphasis, teaches 2 - 3 of the courses and coordinates the Patient Navigation Experiential Agency Rotations. Either full -time or adjunct faculty in t he Department of Health, Policy, Management and Leadership teaches two courses. A faculty researcher (Dr. Nicole Stoudt) in the Mary Babb Cancer Center at WVU with a joint appointment and 20% teaching assignment in the SPH, specializes in patient navigat ion and cancer survivorship, teaches one of the courses, and will have an ongoing relationship with the program coordinator. In summary, the School responds to ongoing requests from its collaborative partners and stakeholders to make curriculum decisions. Those strategic discussions sometimes involve revisions and/or additions to the curriculum. During the strategic planning period covering 2017 through 2019 the articulation and development of programs relied on feedback and information gathered as part of program reviews . The implementation of the \" Meaningful Collaborations\" priority action team will assist with the current and ongoing development of meaningful partnerships with various stakeholders to identify new academic degree opportunities and to deliver timely public health education. The input received from external st akeholders will allow us to better equip students with the knowledge required to confront new and existing public health challenges while simultaneously strengthening the public health workforce of West Virginia. This early example of a collaboration with a lasting impact will also serve as a roadmap for and build bridges to the Student Centric and Impactful Discovery, priority actions teams. Evidence can be viewed in section B6 , Example 2, of the ERF. 58 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2020 Strategic Plan Goals met by the two examples abov e are provided in the table. The Green text indicate those goals that intersect with the current focus of the Priority Action Teams.

Strengths : We have a comprehensive infrastructure in place to inform our day -to-day operations as well as strategic initiatives. We have been able to utilize a variety of quantitative and qualitative data sources to make informed decisions. Weaknesses: None noted 60 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 61 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH C1. Fiscal Resources The school has financial resources adequate to fulfill its stated mission and goals. Financial support is adequate to sustain all core functions, including offering coursework and other elements necessary to support the full array of degrees and ongoing operations. 1) Describe the school's budget processes, including all sources of funding. This description addresses the following, as applic able: The HSC maintains a comprehensive budget planning process that incorporates unit level budget development for a given fiscal year beginning in the preceding year. Individual units/schools develop revenue and expense budget requests for the upcoming fiscal year in line with the guidelines set forth by the WVU University Planning Committee (UPC). In part, the University Planning Committee consists of the University Provost & Vice President of Academic Affairs, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer , Vice President Health Sciences Center, Vice President Research Office, and Associate Vice President Finance. Operating units/schools within the HSC receive a central allocation of funds for salary and operating expenses. Central revenues consist of appropriations from the State of West Virginia, University tuition and fees, and indirect cost recovery. Central allocations are based on historical allocations, tuition revenue, and also consider current and future changes and requests. University and HSC financial performance also affects fund allocations. In periods of declining enrollment, the University or HSC may experience a need to decrease in revenue. That decrease will be allocated out to all schools within HSC. Alternatively, allocations may be increased should the University or HSC experience positive financial performance. The central allocation expires at the end of each fiscal year and those funds do not roll over to the next fiscal year. Exceptions can be made, however, whereby HSC will allow a carryover of unexpended funds, as needed, on a case- by-case basis. a) Briefly describe how the school pays for faculty salaries. If this varies by individual or appointment type, indicate this and provide examples. Faculty salaries are funded through a combination of the HSC central allocation, grants and contracts, and endowment funds. Tenure- track faculty in twelve month positions are expected to support at least 25% of their annual salary with extramural funding by the beginning of their fourth year of appointment, with the potential to further supplement their salary through the Faculty Research Incentive plan. Further, they are expected to show progress toward the 25% funding throughout appointment years one through three. Research track faculty in four Research Centers of the School are expected to fully fund all research efforts via extramural funds. b) Briefly describe how the school requests and/or obtains additional faculty or staff (additional = not replacements for individuals who left). If multiple models are possible, indicate this and provide examples. Additional faculty and staff needs are generally communicated to the Dean, Senior Associate Dean for Administration or Chief of Staff. Funds needed for additional positions are discussed with the Senior Business Planning Officer and available fund balances are discussed. If central funds are not available, SPH can request additional funding from HSC. Approvals for addi tional funding are made on a case- by-case basis. Also, non- central funds are used to support additional, necessary positions. 62 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH c) Describe how the school funds the following: a. operational costs (schools define \"operational\" in their own contexts; definition must be included in response) Operational costs are those expenses necessary to carry out the daily operations of the School, excluding salary and fringe expense. Examples include supplies, travel, hospitality, minor equipment, marketing, and maintenance. Each of the five departments, Central Administration, Academic and Student Affairs, and other administrative offices, each receive an operating budget allocation from the HSC central allocation. Departmental operating budgets are based on historical trends, while also considering current and future departmental changes. Non- central funding, such as revenues from tuition allocations and professional service agreements, may also be used. Operating costs are also supported by external funding, grants and contrac ts, awarded for specific projects and budgeted within the SPH for the duration of the projects. Operating costs can also be supported with the Chair's Tax funds that each of the five departments have and with the individual faculty incentive funds that faculty have the opportunity to earn. Tenured and tenure stream f aculty that cover 25% of their base salary with external sources of funding are eligible to participate in the grant/external funding incentive program. Faculty are given the option to receive the incentive funds directly in their paychecks, deposit the funds in non- central funds for other uses, or a combination of both of these options. Incen tive funds deposited in non- central funds are net of a taxes applied and distributed to the Dean's tax fund and the appropriate departmental chair's tax funds. Finally, as appropriate and in accordance with donor restrictions, WVU Foundation donor funds may be used for operating expenses. b. student support, including scholarships, support for student conference travel, support for student activities, etc. The S PH uses a portion of the online University tuition (Academic Innovation) that is received non-centr ally to fund student scholarships. In addition, The SPH also receives gifts, as established through the West Virginia University Foundation, to assist with support of the School , including student scholarships, student travel, memberships, and other needed expenses. The SPH has a D irector of D evelopment who works with donors and alumni to solicit donations. Student Affairs uses a portion of their central budget allocation to support student travel, the Student Association of Public Health (SAPH), and other general student expenses. External grant and contract funding are also used to support student workers, travel, and other expenses, providing the expense is approved by the sponsor, written into the award, appropriate per University policies and follows Uniform Guidance. c. faculty development expenses, including travel support. If this varies by individual or appointment type, indicate this and provide examples Faculty development expenses may be supported with the annual central operating budget allocations that each of the five departments receive. Additionally, faculty have the opportunity to participate in the grant/external funding incentive program. Faculty are given the option to receive the incentive funds directly in their paychecks, deposit the funds in non- central funds for other uses, or a combination of both of these options. Incentive funds deposited in non- central funds may be used for faculty development expenses. Next, as part of the recruitment process, faculty may receive a start -up package. Amounts vary, but may be used to support 63 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH professional development expenses. Finally, faculty may use external grant and contract funding to support development expenses, providing the expense is approved by the sponsor, written into the award, appropri ate per University policies and follows Uniform Guidance. d) In general terms, describe how the school requests and/or obtains additional funds for operational costs, student support and faculty development expenses. The School receives a central allocation each fiscal year and in general, the allocation not used reverts back to HSC after the close of the year. Exceptions can be made, however, whereby HSC will allow a carryover of unexpended funds, as needed, on a case- by-case basis. The School has, and will continue to receive, strong HSC financial support and assistance to fulfill the critical mission of the School. To specifically request additional funding, the Dean, or other members of School Administration, would meet with the WVU Budget Planning depart ment to discuss the needs of the School. Additional funding may even be provided on a temporary basis if not available or needed on an ongoing, long -term basis. Additionally, because there is a University and college component to student tuition, the School has the ability to increase college tuition, which will directly impact the School. e) Explain how tuition and fees paid by students are returned to the school. If the school receives a share rather than the full amount, explain, in general terms, how the share returned is determined. If the school's funding is allocated in a way that does not bear a relationship to tuition and fees generated, indicate this and explain. Tuition at WVU has both a University and college component. The University tuition is one standard rate, which may be adjusted each year, and is the same for all Schools across the University. College tuition is a separate, lower rate, set by each School, which can also be adjusted annually, but generally not to exceed the percentage increase of the University tuition. There are two separate rates because the University wanted one standard rate for all Schools, while allowing Schools to have input on rates specific to their Schools. The college tuition rates vary by college and may vary based on market rates, enrollment, and other factors. University and college tuition paid by the students is received by HSC and allocated, in part, to the five HSC schools as part of their annual central allocation. The SPH receives 40% of University tuition for online courses (Academic Innovation) directly in a non- central fund. The other 60% of University tuition for online courses is included in central allocation that the School receives. SPH receives 100% of University tuition for in- person courses. SPH receives 85% of college tuition in the central allocation. The other 15% of the college tuition is retained by HSC. f) Explain how indirect costs associated with grants and contracts are returned to the school and/or individual faculty members. If the school and its faculty do not receive funding through this mechanism, explain. Indirect cost recoveries are not received by or allocated back to the SPH, or any other HSC school, but rather are retained by HSC. HSC retains these indirect costs as the schools are not charged space costs, utilities, and other centrally supported services such as information technology, maintenance, custodial, security, etc. 64 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2) A clearly formulated school budget statement in the format of Template C1- 1, showing sources of all availabl e funds and expenditures by major categories, for the last five years. Table C1 -1: Sources of Funds and Expenditures by Major Category, 2015 to 2019 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Source of Funds Tuition cost recovery is included in HSC allocation as previously described. 65 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Row definitions: Tuition and Fees includes the portion of academic innovation (online) tuition received in non- central accounts. It also includes the tuition transfer for the SHED program and college tuition for the MS in Health Sciences. State Appropriated Revenue includes state appropriations to assist in the development of the SPH. Self-Generating represents fee- for-service contracts. Grants/Contracts revenue is counted in the year the funds were expended. HSC Allocation is determined centrally by HSC Finance. Office of Research & Graduate Education is provided by the HSC ORGE specifically for PhD student support. Endowment/Other Income represents investment return on endowments and dues/other fees housed in the WVU Foundation for the benefit of SPH. Gifts represent spendable donations housed in the WVU Foundation designated to benefit SPH. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: The SPH continues to receive strong institutional support and funding from the HSC. The SPH added an undergraduate program in spring of 2016. Since that time, enrollment has steadily increased each year, which has increased tuition revenue. A percentage of online University tuition is received non- centrally, meaning that those funds roll over each year and do not expire as centrally allocated funds do, and online University tuition has steadily increased each year through FY19. Additionally, through a combination of the central allocation and a non- central trans fer, the SPH receives 100% of University tuition. To promote retention and success, enhance research, instruction, training, and public service, the School offers a faculty incentive pay program (FIPP). Faculty who earn these incentive payments have the op tion to enhance their salary, transfer the incentives to a non- central incentive fund to support expenses, or a combination of both. As part of the recruitment process, SPH faculty may be offered a start -up package. These funds are attractive incoming fac ulty and support their efforts in acquiring external funding and other program start -up costs. Weaknesses: Although the SPH has increased gifts and endowments since the School was established in 2012, the SPH continues to build its alumni base and reputati on, thus further increasing gifts and endowments. Plans: The Dean is working with the Director of Development to increase development efforts and gifts. Further, with time, the alumni base will continue to grow, as should gifts and endowments. 66 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY B LANK 67 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH C2. Faculty Resources The school has adequate faculty, including primary instructional faculty and non- primary instructional faculty, to fulfill its stated mission and goals. This support is adequate to sustain all core functions, including offering coursework and advising students. The stability of resources is a factor in evaluating resource adequacy. Students' access to a range of intellectual perspectives and to breadth of thought in their chosen fields of study is an impor tant component of quality, as is faculty access to colleagues with shared interests and expertise. All identified faculty must have regular instructional responsibility in the area. Individuals who perform research in a given area but do not have some regular expectations for instruction cannot serve as one of the three to five listed members. 1) A table demonstrating the adequacy of the school's instructional faculty resources in the format of Template C2- 1. 68 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Table C2 -1.1: Adequacy of the School's Ins tructional Faculty First Degree Level Second Degree Level 1.0 Sijin Wen 1.0 Christa Lilly 1.0 Not Yet Assigned PIF: 2 , Non -PIF: 1 MPH, MS, PhD Epidemiology Thomas Hulsey 1.0 Karen E Innes 1.0 Ruchi Bhandari 1.0 Sarah S Knox 1.0 PIF: 1 , Non -PIF: 7 MPH, PhD Health Policy, Management and Leadership Lindsay D Allen 1.0 Thomas K Bias 1.0 Lauri A Andress 1.0 N/A PIF: 3 , Non -PIF: 4 MPH Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences Travis Knuckles 1.0 Michael McCawley 1.0 Lan Guo 1.0 Weimin Gao 1.0 PIF: 0 , Non -PIF: 3 MPH, PhD Social and Sciences Abildso Danielle 5 , Non -PIF: 5 MPH, PhD Public Health Toni Morris 1.0 Elizabeth Claydon 1.0 Greg Hand 1.0 N/A PIF: 7 , Non- PIF: 4 BS Health Services Management and Leadership Lindsay D Allen 1.0 Danielle Davidov *This table will be complete after faculty assignments are made for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. 69 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Table C2 -1.3: Total Faculty Represented in Table C2-1.1 TOTALS: Named PIF 24 Total PIF 40 Non-PIF 24 2) All primary instructional faculty, by definition, are allocated 1.0 FTE. Schools must explain the method for calculating FTE for any non- primary instructional faculty presented in C2- 1. Faculty FTE status is determined by calculating the percentage of time the faculty member spends in a 40 hour work week doing what they are being measured to do. For example, if they teach one day per week then the y are considered 20% teaching. The methodology for calculating the FTE for any non -primary instructional faculty equal to .10 FTE is because we consider a half of a work day to be 10% effort. Our assumption is that an adjunct or lecturer is being hired to teach 1 course which equals a half day of effort. We hire our adjunct and lecturers on a course by course basis. Therefore, we list these faculty as .10FTE. If they were hired to teach more than one course, we would adjust the FTE percentage in accordance with the course load. 3) If applicable, provide a narrative explanation that supplements reviewers' understanding of data in the templates. None. 4) Data on the following for the most recent year in the format of Template C2- 2. See Template C2-2 for additi onal definitions and parameters. Academic Year 2018- 19 On page 51 of this document we described the integration of academic and student affairs, and provide evidence of qualitative and quantitative data utilized to inform this change. Academic Advising was a critical part of this transformation. Specifically, student feedback on their experiences with advising over a 3- year period inspired the centralizing of advising services. We revised a Student Affairs staff role to accommodate this need. Since 2016, Ms. Leah Adkins has provided comprehensive advising for all graduat e students in consultation with Department Chairs and the respective program directors for the MPH and PhD. Ms. Adkins completes a formal Plan of Study for each student, which informs the trajectory of course choices, degree requirements, and milestones for graduation (see sample plan in section C2 of the ERF).

However, the following description of advising is more accurate for the WVU SPH . Bachelor of Science Public Health Advising Ratios All students (including special cases such as athletes, VA benefits, dual degree, double major, or those struggling academically) are advised by the staff undergraduate academic advisor, Mr. Scott Mahaney at a ratio of 1:175 As a retention effort, Ms. Sarah Op atz handles all internal transfers (students who want to switch majors to public health). She recruits internal transfer students in a variety of ways on campus, maintains communication records and handles follow -up, and hosts three information sessions p er semester for students to learn more about the field and the major. Once students meet with her or attend an information session, Ms. Opatz refers the students to Mr. Mahaney for advising sessions where they are officially matriculated to the public heal th program. Ms. Opatz currently has an annual caseload ratio of 1:52. 71 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH The Assistant Dean and Program Director of Undergraduate Programs, supervises the advising and retention efforts of Mr. Mahaney and Ms. Opatz. Master of Science Biostatistics & Master of Public Health Advising In the MPH program, students are advised by cohort. The current advising ratio for AY 2019/2020 is 1:40. In addition to group and individual advising by Dr. Linda A. Alexander, Interim Director of the MPH Program, these students are assigned a primary staff advisor, Ms. Leah Adkins, Senior Program Coordinator in the Office of Student Services. During advising sessions students complete and co- sign a plan of study (example in section C2 of the ERF) . In 2018, the Office of Graduate Life and Education flagged our Plans of Study (POS) as outstanding, and Ms. Leah Adkins was asked to train other units. MS Biostati stics students are individually advised by the Associate Dean for Professional Programs, Dr. Erik Carlton in consultation from Biostatistics Departmental faculty. These students also meet with Ms. Adkins from the Office of Student Services to formalize and co-sign their plans of study. The current ratio for this academic year is 1:9. Doctor of Philosophy Public Health Sciences The three department representatives from the programs that offer a concentration advise doctoral students. Departmental academi c advisors serve as faculty mentors for PhD students during the first two years of their coursework. The Director of the PhD Programs, Dr. Alfgeir Kristjansson, advises students individually. Two mandatory advising sessions are held each academic year. WVU SPH doctoral students embrace the Biomedical Sciences model. Students in this program are given an Individualized Development Plan (IDP). Mentors begin identifying potential career paths for students no later than their second year when students are t ransitioned to a dissertation or research mentor. Career Development and Student Success In July of 2017, the SPH appointed its first Director of Career Services. Mr. Scot McIntosh's formal title is Director of Career Development and Student Success, and he has served in this capacity for the last two years. Mr. McIntosh serves students across all SPH degree programs (undergrad and graduate). His primary foci include: Providing individual career advising and coaching sessions Connecting with alumni to integrate them into current student activities Providing guidance for students as the Staff Advisor for the Student Association of Public Health (SAPH) Guest lecturing in SPH classes about Public Health Career Pathways Tracking graduate outcomes data for our accrediting body, CEPH Developing SPH specific content for our the SPH websi te, https://publichealth.hsc.wvu.edu/students/student -resources/career -development/ . In just over 2 years, Mr. McIntosh has had at least one individual career advising session with 163 SPH students. Additionally, he developed and teaches a credit bearing career based class (PUBH 72 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 200 - Intro to Public Health Careers & Information) that is offered every semester. As of fall 2019, over 100 SPH undergraduates have completed the course. He has guest lectured in multiple SPH classes, has integrated alumni guest speakers into monthly SAPH meetings (approximately 30 members attend each meeting) and hosted several career panels per semester in his undergraduate career class. Mr. McIntosh has built out a section of the SPH website with career preparation materials (14 handouts) and a job board, https://publichealth.hsc.wvu.edu/students/student -resources/career - development/jobs/ for public health students with over 350 public health job postings. The decision to appoint staff and departmental advisors was based on significant qualitative and quantitative feedback over the course of a four -year period. It was determined in 2017 that our advising needs would be best served by those with the titles and roles in the narrative descriptions. Please see sect ion C2 of the ERF for undergraduate and graduate student satisfaction with advising surveys. 5) Quantitative data on student perceptions of the following for the most recent year. Schools should only present data on public health degrees and concentrations. a. Class size and its relation to quality of learning ( e.g., The class size was conducive to my learning) Rather than asking questions regarding class size on individual SEIs where a faculty member can be unfairly judged for circumstances they do not control, we are working with the Office of Research and Graduate Education to include questions about class size and the impact on learning in the Graduate Student Satisfaction Survey. As a direct result of preliminary self -study feedback, the School of Public Health was able to leverage with the University the addition of 4 questions on the SEIs (student evaluations) to address quantitative feedback regarding perceptions of class size and faculty availability. These questions have been included in the s pring 2020 SEIs . b. Availability of faculty ( i.e., Likert scale of 1- 5, with 5 as very satisfied) The Office of Research and Graduate Education at the Health Sciences Center annually surveys all graduate students that ask this question along with the univers ity-wide student evaluation of instruction. As a direct result of preliminary self -study feedback, the School of Public Health was able to leverage with the University the addition of 4 questions on the SEIs (student evaluations) to address quantitative feedback regarding perceptions of class size and faculty availability. These questions have been included in the spring 2020 SEIs . 6) Qualitative data on student perceptions of class size and availability of faculty. Only present data on public health degrees and concentrations. We do not currently collect data specific to the availability of student perceptions of class size and availability of faculty. However, during our Program Directors' formal meetings with students for each 73 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH of our public health degrees and concentrations there has been no feedback, formal or otherwise, as to students' dissatisfaction with faculty availability or class size during this last academic year. As a direct result of preliminary self -study feedback, the School of Public Health was able to leverage with the University the addition of 4 questions on the SEIs (student evaluations) to address qualitative feedback regarding perceptions of class size and faculty availability. These questions have been included in the spring 2020 SEIs . 7) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: Our students are incredibl y vocal and based on those factors they believe would enhance their academic experience (scholarships for MPH students, parking, private cubicles for studying) we feel certain that the perception of a lack of faculty availability or dissatisfaction of class size would have been articulated during many face- to-face opportunities with program directors, the Office of Academic Affairs, Academic Advisor, and via the Student Association. We have interpreted their lack of a voice around these two features of learning as a positive. However, please note in our plans below that will add questions as part of the Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI's) to get at these two queries in a more formal and substantive way. Weaknesses: Not everyone completes a feedback form or Student Evaluation. Plans: We are implementing the questions (5 and 6) on SEI Spring 2020. 74 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 75 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH C3. Staff and Other Personnel Resources The school has staff and other personnel adequate to fulfill its stated mission and goals. The stability of resources is a factor in evaluating resource adequacy. The School has outstanding support to fulfill its teaching, research, and service missions. Departmental Administrators provide critical support to departmental faculty in their day -to-day roles as instructors and help maintain the documentation needed for continuous quality improvement through meeting minutes, communication, process, and procedures. Trained staff provide assistance with pre and post awards in response to grant applications to ensure timeliness and compliance as part of institutional resear ch priorities. A team of additional expert staff in the Dean's Administrative Suite contributes daily assistance with finance, communication, and marketing and information technology. Talented recruitment, admissions, career counseling, and practice staff are relied upon daily to support the academic enterprise. The School also benefits from an assessment specialist whose full -time staff position is devoted to the ensuring the appropriate mechanisms for competencies and evaluation are in place. 1) A table defining the number of the school's staff support for the year in which the site visit will take place by role or function in the format of Template C3- 1. Designate any staff resources that are shared with other units outside the unit of accreditation.

This person works for the HSC at 0.1 FTE and for the School at 0.9 FTE. 76 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2) Provide a narrative description, which may be supported by data if applicable, of the contributions of other personnel. Teaching Assistants are among the most invaluable staff because they support faculty with large courses, those who have significant research goals as part of their portfolio, and adjunct faculty main content expertise but whom are unfamiliar with our internal course management system (SOLE). The School also employs 32 student workers, who work up to 20 hours per week support ing faculty research projects. Supervised by faculty, student workers provide assistance with data collection and analysis, literature searches and reviews, and manuscript drafting and editing. 3) Provide narrative and/or data that support the assertion that the school's staff and other personnel support is sufficient or not sufficient. The staff and other personnel are sufficient to support the school. A total of 66 FTEs support the 55 faculty, for a ration of 6:5 staff members to faculty members. 4) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths : WVU SPH has more than adequate support to maintain its vision, mission, and goals. Weaknesses: There are no current weaknesses identified in the current self -study Plans: None at the present time 77 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH C4. Physical Resources The school has physical resources adequate to fulfill its stated mission and goals and to support instructional schools. Physical resources include faculty and staff office space, classroom space, student shared space and laboratories, as applicable. 1) Briefly describe, with data as applicable, the following. (Note: square footage is not required unless specifically relevant to the school's narrative.) The SPH is located within the WVU Health Sciences Center (HSC), a building with over one million square feet of space. The HSC houses the Schools of Public Health, Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy as well as associated dental and medical clinics. The majority of office and meeting space dedicated to the School is located on the third floor of the HSC , South side. However, several portions of the school are located in varying areas. Classroom space is shared by all schools in the HSC and scheduled by request. Adequate space is available to fulfill the mission of the S PH; however, contiguous space in the HSC would be advantageous. The SPH holds a footprint of 19,700 square feet which includes 91 offices, six conference rooms, two science labs, and three kitchen areas for faculty, staff, and students. Included in the office space are areas s pecifically assigned for SPH students to study and/or work in addition to multiple areas from which they are free to choose throughout the HSC. A uditorium style as well as smaller classrooms are available as needed and reserved via a centralized University -wide scheduling system. As the University constructs a new building or remodels a current building, they are standardizing space, which will help ensure consistency of office size among faculty and staff. Faculty office space Faculty occupy 51 offices totaling 7,386 square feet. All full -time faculty have private offices. All faculty offices have wired network and Wi -Fi capabilities and are equipped to support the work of the individual faculty member. Faculty offices are organized typically by academic and research focus, allowing faculty the opportunity to regularly interact with other faculty who have similar interests. Staff office space Staff occupy 37 offices totaling 6,187 square feet. All staff have either a private office or a worksta tion in a multi -person room. All staff offices have wired network and Wi -Fi capabilities and are equipped to support the work requirements of each staff member. SPH staff are typically grouped in teams within buildings, allowing faculty, staff and student s the opportunity to locate needed support staff in a location based on function. Classrooms Classrooms in the HSC are shared with the five schools that reside in the building, Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Public Health. The University uses scheduling software, 25Live, to request/reserve rooms for instruction, meetings, and events. Rooms vary in size and style, from large auditoriums to small conference room s. Classroom technology at the HSC is equipped with multiple technologies to enhance curriculum delivery. 78 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Shared student space Students currently occupy 2,450 square feet of space to study and work. In the 2016- 17 academic year, the S PH installed a 19 station student computer lab that is available to all public health students. The computer lab is open and available from 8 am to 5 pm Monday through Friday and follows the WVU holiday calendar. Each computer is equipped with software to conduct research and complete homework assignments. In addition to the space within the S PH, students have access to 27 study rooms and 7 lounge areas in the Health Sciences Center. The Student Public Health Association worked with Administration to develop a blueprint and a fundraiser to remodel the current student lab to a state -of-the-art student lounge. Laboratories, if applicable to public health degree school offerings The S PH currently uses two science laboratories. The first laboratory, is shared by two faculty members and the second laboratory is used by the Chair of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences. If we recruit a new faculty member that will require the use of a laboratory, we have the ability to acquire the needed space within the HSC footprint. 2) Provide narrative and/or data that support the assertion that the physical space is sufficient or not sufficient. Since our last site visit, we continue making progress to have contiguous sp ace in the Health Sciences Center. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: Space is designated based on student needs. If a need arises that has not been addressed, it will typically get escalated. It is advantageous to have students serving on select committees regarding space and other resources - so they can voice their opinions/concerns and be a part of the decision- making process/solution. An example of the effecti veness of a student voice in all administrative committees is the current plans for remodeling outdated student space. Weaknesses: SPH is in competition with four other schools in the building regarding space. Overall, space needs are growing and the available space within the HSC is shrinking due to understandably competition with medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and nursing, each with accrediting bodies that require certain specifications for space. Plans: Conduct a space audit to assess if the SPH can m ore efficiently utilize existing assigned space. Move forward with blueprints developed to renovate existing computer laboratory space into a combination student lounge an workstation. This was a collaboration among Delta Omega, SAPH, Student Ambassadors, and Student Leaders (members of Academic Affairs, Dean's Council, Curriculum Committee, Diversity Task Force). 79 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH C5. Information and Technology Resources The school has information and technology resources adequate to fulfill its stated mission and goals and to support instructional schools. Information and technology resources include library resources, student access to hardware and software (including access to specific software or other technology required for instructional schools), faculty access to hardware and software (including access to specific software required for the instructional schools offered) and technical assistance for students and faculty. 1) Briefly describe, with data if applicable, the following: library resources and support available for students and faculty WVU Library The School of Public Health (SPH) has access to an abundance of information resources and services available via WVU Libraries. The WVU Libraries encompasses seven libraries: the Downtown Campus Library, Evansdale Libr ary, Health Sciences Library (Morgantown), Law Library, Health Sciences Library (Charleston), Mary F. Shipper Library at Potomac State College, Beckley Library at WVU Institute of Technology, and West Virginia and Regional History Center.

WVU HSL currently provides access to approximately 960 e- journals specifically relating to public health topics. These journals include 90% of the public health titles analyzed for Journal Citation Report s. Our library subscribes to a wide range of bibliographic databases ranging from broad coverage like PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science to more focused resources like Statistical Abstracts of the United States. WVU Libraries uses a link resolving service that improves access to research using licensed databases on the Internet that describe journal articles, - Find it @ WVU http://ad4tq3g q5x.searc h.serialssolutions.com/?SS_Page=refiner&SS_RefinerEditable=yes . Clicking on this link (from these databases, accessed through the libraries website), displays a list of all possible full -text digital options and facilitates the completion of electronic doc ument delivery requests in PDF documents when journal articles are not available locally. HSC Library Acquisitions The WVU Health Sciences book collection is ever increasing and incorporating new books on diverse topics related to the highly interdiscipli nary field of public health. Librarians regularly order new books and consider acquiring requests for specific books or journal subscriptions. The 80 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH document delivery staff can rapidly locate and deliver materials from other WVU Libraries, PALCI Consortium ( NJ, PA, and WV libraries); and libraries in the entire United States and international locations. HSC Library Assistance The WVU HSL offers extensive reference assistance for performing systematic reviews, formulating online search strategies, conducting database searches, validating citations, locating materials not owned by this library, or any other research assistance that might be needed. Librarians offer hands -on instruction in PubMed, RefWorks, and EndNote to individuals and groups. They also offer customized training when requested for project teams. Librarians develop research guides on a variety of topics and for specific classes. Descriptions of the public health research guides and the WVU H SL available at https://libguides.wvu.edu/sb.php?subject_id=83544 . student access to hardware and software (including access to specific software or other technology required for instructional schools) Student Access to Hardware The SPH has a graduate student computer lab with 19 desktops available for SPH graduate students. The lab is located within the S PH office spaces and near the offices of SPH Information Technology Services, Academic Affairs and Student Services. It is open 8am -5pm Monday through Friday and students can obtain swipe card access to work in the lab after hours or on weekends upon request. The computers are equipped with all the software required for Public Health courses and degree programs. Students also have access to the WVU Libraries rooms and resources ( https://library.wvu.edu/services/computers -and-laptops ). There are 25 study rooms at the Downtown Campus Library, 31 available at the Evansdal e Campus Library and 10 available at the H SC Library. Students can book the study rooms online at https://wvu.libcal.com/spaces . There are over 425 computers in the WVU Libraries system that are available for P ublic Health student use.

The Health Sciences Library, located within the same building as S PH offices, has 55 public desktops available in the library's commons area, 8 desktops in study rooms, and 74 classroom desktops available when class is not in session. Student Access to Software All WVU students have an account they use to sign into online WVU resources as well as computers in labs, classrooms and study rooms. All students also have a Microsoft account and a Google account they access with the same username and password. The Google account is referred to as their MIX (Mountaineer Information Express) account and it gives them access to G Suite Applications including Gmail, Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Calendar among other applications. They also have 25 GB of free storage available in Google Drive. WVU also provides Microsoft Office free to all current students via the Microsoft account. Microsoft Office includes Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access among other applications and student licensing 81 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH allows it to be installed on up to five different personal devices. Additional software for personal devices can be purchased from the WVU Software Licensing Information Center (SLIC) at greatly reduced academic prices. Students and employees can purchase the software online at http://slic.wvu.edu . Another WVU resource for discounted software is WVU OnTheHub, students and employees can purchase software at reduced academic prices on the website at http://wvu.onthehub.com . At HSC, SOLE (Study Observe Learn Engage) is the Learning Management System for students to access online courses and supplemental course materials. Students who are enrolled in a course are automatically added to the corresponding SOLE course with a student role. Students and employees can access SOLE online at this URL: http://sole.hsc.wvu.edu . SOLE was developed at HSC and houses content, information tools, communication tools and assessment tools. Student Laptop Requirement All graduate students are required to have a laptop meeting the minimum specifications listed on our website: https://publichealth.hsc.wvu.e du/students/student -resources/policies -forms/student - computer -policy/ . In previous years, the S PH had a laptop program. Laptops were charged to students as part of tuition and fees. The cost added an extra financial burden to students who often already had laptops that could meet or exceed usability standards. Many students wanted the option to pick out their own laptop, to match their preference of Mac OS X or Windows 10, with smaller or larger screen sizes as needed. They also wanted the chance to get their own laptop at greatly discounted rates when available in stores. After receiving this feedback early on in the program, it was determined that graduate students would be better served by dissolving the laptop program for future students and allowing them to provide their own laptop as long as it meets the minimum requirements listed in the student computer policy on our website. faculty access to hardware and software (including access to specific software or other technology required for instructional schools) Faculty Access to Hardware All SPH faculty and staff are allocated one or more computers to work on. Employee computers are on a 3- 5 year replacement cycle. The minimum requirement for a new computer is an i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, a solid -state hard drive and it must support hard drive encryption. Each employee can choose between a desktop or laptop computer with their preferred operating system, Windows 10 or Mac OS X. In order to streamline equipment, and ensure it meets usability and securit y standards, a list of pre-approved hardware is available and continuously updated. The list of pre- approved equipment for the H SC is available at https://its.hsc.wvu.edu/comp uter-support/hsc -standard- equipment/ . Alternative/customized equipment may be purchased, but must be reviewed and approved by Information Technology prior to purchase to ensure compatibility and that it meets current security standards. All Windows computers must have a TPM chip to support BitLocker encryption. All computers running Mac OS X must support Filevault encryption. Classrooms within the H SC are equipped with a variety of different learning tools to support different learning environments - for example, standard lecture halls with a presenter computer, lectern and projector as well as classrooms for team -based learning and interprofessional practice 82 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH and education. Information about the rooms and capabilities can be located on the HSC website at https://its.hsc.wvu.edu/media/7907/general -room -info.pdf . All classrooms either have a PC or are laptop ready with a TV available for display depending on the type of room. There ar e also conference room spaces in various locations within the HSC with five conference rooms specifically assigned to SPH. Each S PH conference room is equipped with a computer, projector/tv and web conferencing equipment as well as VOIP phones with teleconferencing capabilities. The HSC conference rooms, and most SPH conference rooms, can be booked online using the 25Live system at https://25live.collegenet.com/wvu/ . Faculty Access to Software Public Health faculty can request software for their work computer(s) at any time. Requests for software in classroom computers, computer labs or other public machines can be made at any time, but preferably requests are made well before the semester when the software is needed. If software is required for accessibility and/or instructional purposes it is purchased by S PH or the related academic department. Software will then be promptly installed by an IT technician upon appointment. WVU has many contracts with software vendors in order to provide software to our students and faculty at no cost or at greatly reduced costs. Students and employees can purchase software online at http://slic.wvu.edu . Another WVU resource for discounted software is WVU OnTheHub, students and employees can purchase software at reduced academic prices on the website at http://wvu.onthehub.com . technical assistance available for students and faculty Technical Assistance Technical assistance for students and faculty is available from multiple sources. The S PH has an internal IT position and trained student workers to assist students, faculty and staff to meet the School's internal technical needs. In addition, the HSC Information Technology Services has several teams offering direct technical assistance. The HSC Helpdesk provides assistance with computers, printers, networking, accounts and software. The Helpdesk can be contacted via phone, email or the walk -up service desk located in the Health Sciences on the second floor. The SOLE support team is available to help students and instructors with questions and assistance using the SOLE. They are also located on the second floor of the H SC. The SOLE support team can be contacted via phone, email , or the walk -up service desk . Classroom Technologies is available for immediate assistance in HSC classrooms and conference rooms. Classrooms have a VoIP phone at the lectern or nearby with the number to Classroom Technologies Programmed in as a hotkey. They are also available via em ail to schedule a classroom walk through and answer questions. HSC Telecommunications offers technical support for phones, conference lines and fax lines. WVU also has an Information Service Desk accessible via phone, email or the walk -up service desks l ocated in the Mountainlair and Bennett Tower. 83 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2) Provide narrative and/or data that support the assertion that information and technology resources are sufficient or not sufficient. Library The SPH access to information and technology resources is sufficient. The WVU Morgantown Libraries provide access to more than two million books, 246 databases, over 48,000 journals and numerous unique digital collections, as well as a range of instructional technologies and equipment available via loan. The Libraries have strong reference and research services and a substantial instruction and information literacy program. WVU librarians are engaged in numerous digitization projects, and have also been involved i n several initiatives to support new forms of scholarly publishing and communication. Technology Computing and technology resources for SPH are sufficient. Students and faculty have access to a variety of hardware and software resources. They have acces s resources both on and offsite and on work devices and in many cases personal devices. IT Satisfaction Results At WVU and HSC, the majority of IT requests are handled through a ticket tracking system call TeamDynamix. SPH IT Support uses TeamDynamix as well as the HSC Helpdesk and SOLE Support. At the resolution or closing of tickets a percentage of requestors are sent a survey to gauge their customer service experience. From a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being not satisfied at all and 10 being completely satisfied, they are asked to rate their level of satisfaction with the quality of service. Survey results indicate that on average the students, faculty and staff of the S PH rated overall satisfaction at 9.51/10, satisfaction with the fix/problems resolution at 9.46/10, the manner or professionalism of the IT Technicians involved at 9.74/10, and the Timeliness of the resolution at 9.59/10. That indicates that on average people are happy with the assistance they receive. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: SPH students, faculty and staff have seamless access to a vast array of information and technology resources both on/off campus. They also have excellent support for those resources. Computers are provided for faculty replaced every 3- 5 years and as needed. There is an abundance of public spaces where students have access to computers and technology on campus. The network access at the H SC is superior. WVU maintains redundant 10 Gbps Internet connections delivered by two different providers. Each internet connection is terminated at a different site on WVU's core network t o provide geographic redundancy ensuring continuity of service if one location or service provider is unavailable. This ensures almost perfect reliability and extremely fast network speeds. Students and employees also have WiFi access across the Health Sci ences building. Students and faculty connect to WVU.Encrypted with their credentials, visiting guests from other Universities can seamlessly use eduroam and other visitors can use the WVU.Guest network. Weaknesses: Currently, the hardware in the student computer lab is being upgraded. Plans: Assess the capacity of the student computer lab . 84 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 85 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH D1. MPH & DrPH Foundational Public Health Knowledge The school ensures that all MPH and DrPH graduates are grounded in foundational public health knowledge. The school validates MPH and DrPH students' foundational public health knowledge through appropriate methods. 1) Provide a matrix, in the format of Templ ate D1- 1, that indicates how all MPH and DrPH students are grounded in each of the defined foundational public health learning objectives (1- 12). The matrix must identify all options for MPH and DrPH students used by the school.

This documentation must include all referenced syllabi, samples of tests or other assessments and web links or handbook excerpts that describe admissions prerequisites, as applicable. Please see Section D1 of the electronic resource file for MPH integrated core curriculum syllabi. 3) If applicable, assessment of strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: We have exceptional faculty teaching in the four courses that cover foundational competencies. Weaknesses: None noted 87 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH D2. MPH Foundational Competencies The school documents at least one specific, required assessment activity ( e.g., component of existing course, paper, presentation, test) for each competency, during which faculty or other qualified individuals ( e.g., preceptors) validate the student's ability to perform the competency. Assessment opportunities may occur in foundation al courses that are common to all students, in courses that are required for a concentration or in other educational requirements outside of designated coursework, but the school must assess all MPH students, at least once, on each competency. Assessment m ay occur in simulations, group projects, presentations, written products, etc. This requirement also applies to students completing an MPH in combination with another degree (e.g., joint, dual, concurrent degrees). For combined degree students, assessment may take place in either degree school. 1) List the coursework and other learning experiences required for the school's MPH degrees, including the required curriculum for each concentration and combined degree option. Information may be provided in the format of Template D2- 1 or in hyperlinks to student handbooks or webpages, but the documentation must present a clear depiction of the requirements for each MPH degree. Along with the list of courses below, each student, regardless of concentration, is required to maintain a portfolio that demonstrates their ability to meet the competencies associate with the MPH Foundational Courses, the Department Major Courses, and to apply a selection of those competencies in an approved practice- based setting(s).

for each of the foundational competencies. If the school addresses all of the listed foundational competencies in a single, common core curriculum, the school need only present a single matrix. If combined degree students do not complete the same core curriculum as students in the standalone MPH school, the sc hool must present a separate matrix for each combined degree. If the school relies on concentration- specific cour ses to assess some of the foundational competencies listed above, the school must present a separate matrix for each concentration.

Please see D2 of the ERF to view the syllabi addressing the competencies mentioned in the above table. 4) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: Beginning with planned revisions to the MPH curriculum in 2016 (The 21st Century MPH) the WVUSPH now has a fully articulated program with all required competencies and assessments in place. This includes an Interprofessional Experience with didactic and ex periential components with other health professions schools and a culminating experience course to demonstrate learning outcomes at the end of student's program. Weaknesses: Historically, efforts to provide WVU public health students with an interprofessi onal education experience had been constrained due to Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, and Rehabilitation Sciences foci on clinical settings and patient -centered outcomes. In 2017, IPE efforts were more in line with desired experiences for Public Health stude nts with the renewal of the Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) grant and the AHEC Scholars Rural Immersion focused experience. ( Please see materials in section D2 of the ERF) . In anticipation of the revised requirements as part of the new CEPH criteria, SPH asked to contribute to the development of the Area Health Education Center (AHEC) grant and the subsequent Rural Scholars program. In 2018, a Cultural Competence in Health Professions Module was developed for the AHEC Rural Scholars program as a pilot for all HSC graduate student involvement in interprofessional education. Undergraduate students were not eligible per grant requirements to participate. Plans: Starting in the Fall semester of 2019, the SPH formally joined the renewed efforts of the HSC Office of Interprofessional Education. Two cohorts of public health students, will participate in the health sciences IPE programming. Second year MPH students will enroll in the PUBH 696- IPE Graduate Seminar course during their final semester. Senior BSPH -Patient Navigation students enrolled in PUBH 400- Field Placement Preparation Seminar will participate in the health science center's IPE programming. This course is taken prior to the Patient Navigation students completing their 75 hour experiential agency rotations and capstone. The annual HSC IPE programming brings together nearly 600 students and 50 faculty and staff facilitators from 12 science colleges or programs to explore interprofessional collaborative practice across health disciplines and profess ions. Students from public health, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, dentistry, etc. will be immersed in a highly participative interprofessional learning experience that is case and lecture- based. At least one student fr om each discipline is assigned to a team facilitated by at least one trained faculty or staff. The programming is designed by three phases. Phase one consists of five Monday Night didactic sessions. The 2019- 20 sessions are aligned with the IPE core compet encies of teamwork, communication, values/ethics and roles and responsibilities for collaborative practice. Session topics and activities include speed networking, the gamification of a vaccination case, and a panel discussion with peer recovery coaches on overcoming stigma of substance abuse disorder. Phase two consists of simulation and community health activities. Students have the option of participating in activities such as disaster response, navigating an outbreak, Narcan administration or 98 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH community health fairs. Online modules will also be optional for students. Students complete collaboration and attitudinal surveys at the conclusion of each activity. Phase three for MPH students will include submission of a reflective essay and presentation to peer s and faculty on their experience. The essay and presentation will focus on demonstrating attainment of the following IPEC competencies and sub -competencies. Describe how professionals in health and other fields can collaborate and integrate clinical car e and public health interventions to optimize population health Reflect on individual and team performance for individual, as well as team, performance improvement. Communicate the importance of teamwork in population health programs and policies. Recognizing how one's individuality contributes to effective communication, conflict resolution, and positive interprofessional working relationships. The BSPH -Patient Navigation students will submit a reflective essay on The Role of the Patient Navigator on an Interprofessional Team for their PUBH 400 course. Moving forward, the Director of Public Health Practice will continue to collaborate with the Health Sciences programs as well as other disciplines including social work, education, nutrition, etc. to strengthen the interprofessional education and opportunities related to the health of populations . 99 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH D3.

Demonstrate Community Engagement Principles when addressing public health problems. SBHS 617 Engagement & Advocacy Self-Reflection Exercise : This is the culminating exercise for the engagement component of SPH 617. It is designed to integrate student understanding of the key principles and processes of community engagement with self -understanding of their own strengths, challenges, and biases that may impact their ability as effective engagement agents. This exercise follows content that covers basic principles of community engagement; describing the roles of various stakeholders in engagement; assessing community characteristics as they relate to engagement; and key principles of effective stakeholder engagement such as identifying diverse interest and perspectives as well as common agendas, and planning and assessing engagement activities. Importantly, from day 1, students are asked to identify the cognitive, personal, and interpersonal competencies necessary for effective engagement. They also reflect on those qualities in themselves, identify strengths and areas for targeted improvement, and existing biases they may have in working with diverse communities. The Self -Reflection Exercise asks students to pick 2 communities; one of these is a community where they are a member and the other is a community where the student is not a member but where s/he might like to do community engagement. Comparing these two s cenarios is designed to bring to awareness how previous knowledge and experience can shape perceptions, assumptions, and biases that are part of the self - examination required for effective engagement. For each community, students describe the community and its strengths and challenges, their relationships to that community, student assumptions and biases (positive and negative) they have about each community. The next part of this exercise requires that students use information from the first part to identify a public health issue of concern to each community and to describe initial steps at engaging each community on that issue. Importantly, students are then asked to review and reflect on these steps, and to identify how they will address their r assumptions and biases as they move through these steps. Finally, students are asked to how they will ascertain progress in addressing these biases. 2. Appraise Qualitative Data used for evaluating factors associated with improving public health. SBHS 616 Introduction to Public Health Interventions for Social and Behavioral Scientists Assessment Report : Students are required to develop a qualitative interview protocol using research on best practices/guidance from the field as well as looking at multiple examples of qualitative interview protocols. They will structure this protocol and use it for the interview portion of the Needs Assessment that is conducted with our community partner. With the community partner's permission, students audio record and take notes of the interview so that they can then conduct thematic analysis on the notes/transcripts to find emergent and main themes for use in the Needs Assessment. They will use these themes to guide their understanding of how to develop an intervention with the community partner. This interview protocol guide is turned in 107 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH along with the results of the interview, including a detailed description of their methods and results of the thematic analysis, with interpretation and implications for use in their interv ention. 3. Appraise Quantitative Data used for evaluating factors associated with improving public health. SBHS 611 Community Assessment Tabletop Assessment Report - All students in SBHS 611 prepare a paper that mimics the process of developing a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) for a county in West Virginia. The purpose is to familiarize the students with the process of responding to a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a real setting by applying their knowledge of the Needs Assessment (NA) process to identify a priority health issue to address and propose how they'll identify what is needed to address the issue. Students are responsible for preparing a proposal of 14-18 pages and making multiple, brief, 10-15- minute presentations to their fellow students using the following sections that require accessing existing data sources such as those housed on the County Health Rankings, CDC's BRFSS and EPH, and Communit y Commons online data repositories: 1) county demographic profile, 2) county health profile, and 3) needs assessment proposal. 4. Implement Social and Behavioral Theories & Frameworks designed to describe public health problems and improve public health interventions. SBHS 615 Intervention Planning & Design Intervention Program Plan : Students will design a theory informed intervention program plan to be submitted in an essay format. This allows students to develop knowledge and apply concepts from this course to a topic that is of interest to them and is consistent with a federal or state priority objectives for health. The project should be based on solid criteria such as either state or federal objectives in the Healthy People 2020 document, the West V irginia Department of Health and Human Resources (WVDHHR), American Public Health Association (APHA), or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as examples. Students will select a topic amenable to an informational/educational approach that can apply behavioral health science theory and develop it into a proposed intervention to contribute to that objective. Specifically: based on theory covered in SBHS 615, students will apply a theory to their proposed intervention strategies. 5. Recommend interventions likely to improve public health. SBHS 615 Intervention Planning & Design Intervention Program Plan : Students will design a theory informed intervention program plan to be submitted in an essay format.

Synthesize Social and Behavioral Sciences Principles to design an evaluation plan of a public health program. SBHS 613 Program Evaluation in Public Health Evaluation Plan Proposal & Final Report Meeting - Mid-way through the semester, the students in 613 present an Evaluation Plan Proposal to a client with whom they have met to identify an evaluation need. This is a draft evaluation plan that is presented to the client in the form of a PowerPoint or Vizio presentation in person or via webinar. The client and relevant key stakeholder(s) will provide feedback about the evaluation plan much like a professional client would when negotiating an evaluation contract. At the end of the semester, the students in 613 present the results of their evaluation work, including any data collected on behalf of the client. This \"final evaluation presentation\" and accompanying report follow the CDC evaluation framework and evaluat ion standards of practice. The entire project is intended to be an application of stakeholder engagement, research methods and data collection, and data reporting skills learned throughout the student's entire curriculum of study. The students present their findings to the client and other key stakeholders in the form of a PowerPoint or Vizio presentation in person or via webinar. The client and relevant key stakeholder(s) provide feedback and help the instructor assess the students' performance. 110 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2) For degrees that allow students to tailor competencies at an individual level in consultation with an advisor, the school must present evidence, including policies and sample documents, that demonstrate that each student and advisor create a matrix in the format of Template D4- 1 for the plan of study. Include a description of policies in the self -study document and at least five sample matrices in the electronic resource file. We do not allow students to tailor competencies at the individual level. 3) Include the most recent syllabus for each course listed in Template D4- 1, or written guidelines for any required elements listed in Template D4- 1 that do not have a syllabus. Please see D4.3 of the ERF to view the syllabi addressing the competencies mentioned in the above tables. 4) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: The SPH has committed to restructuring and enhanci ng the MPH curriculum under the new criteria. The SPH has completed curricular changes and assessment plans addressing the new criteria. Weaknesses: The MPH program is in initial phases of collecting additional student learning feedback to include the new criteria. Plans: The MPH Program will pilot the new assessment management system in SOLE during the 2020- 21 school year. 111 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH D5. MPH Applied Practice Experiences MPH students demonstrate competency attainment through applied practice experiences. The applied practice experiences allow each student to demonstrate attainment of at least five competencies, of which at least three must be foundational competencies (as defined in Criterion D2). The competencies need not be identical from student to student, but the applied experiences must be structured to ensure that all students complete experiences addressing at least five competencies, as specified above. The applied experiences may also address additional foundational or concentration- specific competenc ies, if appropriate. The school assesses each student's competency attainment in practical and applied settings through a portfolio approach, which demonstrates and allows assessment of competency attainment. It must include at least two products. Examples include written assignments, projects, videos, multi -media presentations, spreadsheets, websites, posters, photos or other digital artifacts of learning. Materials may be produced and maintained (either by the school or by individual students) in any physical or electronic form chosen by the school. 1) Briefly describe how the school identifies competencies attained in applied practice experiences for each MPH student, including a description of any relevant policies. Prior to Fall 2019, students completed a work plan agreement which included an overview of the site and project(s) and competencies (minimum five foundational and disincline specific) they aimed to attain during their 180 hours of field work with an approved agency or organization. The work plan also included specific activities that would contribute to achieving the competencies and a measurable final product. The work plan was reviewed and signed by the student, preceptor, faculty mentor and the Director of Practice. Students were then enrolled in PUBH 622 for a minimum of three credit hours (60 field hours=1 credit hour). Students completed monthly and final field reports as well as a final evaluation at the conclusion of their hours. Students self -identified competencies attained in their final report. Preceptors evaluated the students based on competency attainment, work ethic and demonstration of skills. The Director of Practice assigned grades based on student reports, review of products and the preceptor evaluations. A new ad hoc committee dedicated to the integrity of and compliance with standards associated with the Applied Practice Experience, Interprofessional Education and Integrated Learning Experience was developed in Fall 2019. Students must now complete an applied practic e proposal, which is approved by their site preceptor, practice committee and Director of Public Health Practice before they can register for practicum experience credit (PUBH 630). The Applied Practice Experience Proposal is a formal, typed document identifying the agency/organization, its mission, the preceptor, and a brief description of the proposed project(s). The proposal should identify five competencies that will be applied during the practice experience. Three of the five competencies must be foundational. Each of the selected competencies must be paired with a deliverable/product. Work activities are activities that support the creation and completion of products for the organization's use. Before students are awarded a grade for PUBH 630, they m ust post their progress reports, work logs, and final products to their portfolio. Successful completion of proposal objectives as documented by student deliverables will undergo two types of assessment. First, the preceptor evaluation will serves as one form of assessment of competency attainment, documenting the students completed work and that work products were shared with the organization. In addition, the practice committee will use a 112 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH standard scoring rubric to assess attainment of competencies rel ated to quality of deliverables submitted through the portfolio. 2) Provide documentation, including syllabi and handbooks, of the official requirements through which students complete the applied practice experience. Please see section D5 of the ERF for syllabi and handbooks. 3) Provide samples of practice- related materials for individual students from each concentration or generalist degree. The samples must also include materials from students completing combined degree schools, if applicable. The school must provide samples of complete sets of materials (ie, Template D5- 1 and the work products/documents that demonstrate at least five competencies) from at least five students in the last three years for each concentration or generalist degree. If the school has not produced five students for which complete samples are available, note this and provide all available samples.

The SPH can provide five completed work plan documents, final reports and evaluations for some disciplines, but not all. Beginning Fall 2019, the S chool will begin to collect portfolio products under the revised plan described above. Please see section D5 of the ERF to view a sample of student practice related materials. 4) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: The strengths include strong preceptors and sites and the hiring of a new Director of Public Health Practice. Weaknesses: Student materials and documentation before Fall 2018 have deficiencies and areas that were undergoing improvement. Since the hire of a new Director of Public Health practice in Fall 2018, the SPH has been reviewing previous practices and developing impro ved processes to ensure compliance with CEPH criteria. New and refined protocols have been developed to enhance the applied practice experience and expand the portfolio cross- curricular . A new ad hoc committee dedicated to the integrity of and compliance w ith standards associated with the Applied Practice Experience, Interprofessional Education and Integrated Learning Experience was developed in Fall 2019. Other weaknesses include the l ack of portfolios and the lack of a full -time MPH director .

MPH Integrative Learning Experience MPH students complete an integrative learning experience (ILE) that demonstrates synthesis of foundational and concentration competencies. Students in consultation with faculty select foundational and concentration- specific competencies appropriate to the student's educational and professional goals. Professional certification exams ( e.g., CPH, CHES/MCHES, REHS, RHIA) may serve as an element of the ILE, but are not in and of themselves sufficient to satisfy this criterion. The school identifies assessment methods that ensure that at least one faculty member reviews each student's performance in the ILE and ensures that the experience addresses the selected foundational and concentration- specific competencies. Faculty assessment may be supplemented with asse ssments from other qualified individuals ( e.g., preceptors). 1) List, in the format of Template D7- 1, the integrative learning experience for each MPH concentration, generalist degree or combined degree option that includes the MPH. The template also requires the school to explain, for each experience, how it ensures that the experience demonstrates synthesis of competencies. Table D7 -1: MPH Integrative Learning Experience for All MPH Concentrations Integrative learning experience (list all options) How comp etencies are synthesized BIOS 6 29 - (2 Credits) EPID 629 - (2 Credits) HPML 629 - (2 Credits) OEHS 629 - (1 Credit) SBHS 629 - (2 Credits) The capstone project is assessed using the ILE rubric by the capstone instructor based on the goals indicated in the project plan. The instructor evaluates the student's product (i.e.: paper, oral presentation, poster presentation) to ensure that he/she demonstrated synthesis of the foundational and concentration competencies as identified in the project plan. 2) Briefly summarize the process, expectations and assessment for each integrative learning experience. Since 2017, the MPH integrative learning experience has blended foundation and concentration competencies which is demonstrated at the end of program comp letion for each of our five core disciplines. The SPH utilized the capstone as its integrated learning experience for the MPH program. 3) Provide documentation, including syllabi and/or handbooks that communicates integrative learning experience policies and procedures to students. Please see D7 of the ERF for syllabi related student's integrative learning experience. 4) Provide documentation, including rubrics or guidelines that explains the methods through which faculty and/or other qualified individuals assess the integrative learning experience with regard to students' demonstration of the selected competencies. Please see D7 of the ERF for syllabi (with rubrics) related to the student integrative l earning experience. 124 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 5) Include completed, graded samples of deliverables associated with each integrative learning experience option from different concentrations, if applicable. The school must provide at least 10% of the number produced in the last three y ears or five examples, whichever is greater. Please see D7 of the ERF for student examples. 6) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: Students' culminating experience is being evaluated/judged by respective faculty in the students' area of concentration. This helps to ensure that students are synthesizing foundation and concentration competencies in the final product. Weaknesses: None noted Plans: N/A 125 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH D8.

Public Health Bachelor's Degree Cumulative and Experiential Activities Students have opportunities to integrate, synthesize and apply knowledge through cumulative and experiential activities. All students complete a cumulative, integrative and scholarly or applied experience or inquiry project that serves as a capstone to the education experience. These experiences may include, but are not limited to, internships, service- learning projects, senior seminars, portfolio projects, research papers or honors theses. Schools encourage exposure to local -level public health professionals and/or agencies that engage in public health practice. 1) Provide a matrix, in the format of Template D12- 1, that identifies the cumulative and experiential activities through which students have the opportunity to integrate, synthesize and apply knowledge as indicated. Table D12 -1: Cumulative and Experiential Activities Cumulative and Experiential Activity (internships, research papers, service- learning projects, etc.) Narrative describing how activity provides students the opportunity to integrate synthesize and apply knowledge. PUBH 481: Public Health Field Placement (for public health majors in the CPH and PHS AOEs) Students complete 75 hours with a local public/community health agency during their final semester in the Public Health program. During this experience, students complete a project for the agency and complete activities aligned with learning outcomes. The projects and activities completed allow students to integrate and apply knowledge and skills gained from public health courses. Students engage in experiences that are often unique to them and that provide them with opportunities for synthesis of public health concepts to real world issues. Students sometimes have the opportunity to introduce their community partners to public health concepts. Reflections and class discussion about their experiences and how they are applying skills and knowledge also all ows for some discovery. PUBH 482: Health Management Internship (HSML majors) Students complete a 125 hour prearranged internship that is planned, supervised, and evaluated for credit with a health-related agency or office. Students will develop and comp lete outcomes that are detailed in an affiliation agreement. Reflective journal essays and meetings to discuss observations, successes and challenges are scheduled at strategic times during the semester. AUPHA requires a minimum of 120 applied hours. PUBH 486: Patient Navigation Agency Rotation (for public health majors in the PN AOE) Students in the Patient Navigation Area of emphasis complete 75 hours in a unit at West Virginia University Medicine. They complete a work agreement and spend their time al igned with members of the clinical care team PUBH 489: SPH Undergraduate Capstone (for both SPH undergraduate majors) The Capstone provides students with the opportunity to present (draft poster, practice presentation and final presentation) on their fiel d experiences, rotations or internships to stakeholders, and allows them to illuminate how their public health courses, skills and knowledge contributed to the completion of their field experience. Students provide information on the agency, their target 150 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH populations, funding sources, and array of services. They also present data and information on the central issue or focus of their placements and provide context as to the extent of its impact on the community. Students often find new passions and develop new professional goals as a result of their field placements: a direct effect of their community partner, the agency with whom they were placed, and/or the topic they addressed. SPH UG Community Service Requirements All undergraduate students are require d to complete 25 hours of community service by the start of their senior year. These service hours are documented through the Center for Service and Learning iServe system. PUBH 352. Introduction to Social and Behavioral Sciences and Practice This cour se is designated as a service learning course and integrates 10 hours of field experience in an agency that allows students to experience public health interventions and see some of the concepts of the class, (such as social determinants of health, communi cation campaigns, health disparities, etc.) unfold in real -life settings. 151 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2) Include examples of student work that relate to the cumulative and experiential activities. Please see section D12 of the ERF to view student examples. 3) Briefly describe the means through which the school implements the cumulative experience and field exposure requirements. Field Placements and Capstone Students complete a 1 credit hour Field Placement and Capstone Preparation Seminar (PUBH 400) in the semester prior to engaging in their field placements. This course prepares them for their field placement by: providing oversight for resume development and letters of introduction; allowing for completion of HIPAA, ethics and other required training; permitting for processing of background checks (when necessary); completing a developmental session provided by the Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion on implicit bias and working with diverse populations; and introductions and initial meetings with sponsoring community agencies. The field placement and capstone (culminating experience) is combined into one course. There is one course (PUBH 491) for 3 credits for students in the AY 2017- 18 curriculum. We expanded the requirements and credits (to 6) for AY 2018- 19 and 2019- 10 (PUBH 481 and 486). All three courses require students to complete a minimum number of hours with a local public/community healt h agency during their final semester in the Public Health program. Students write guided reflections and meet to discuss their experiences three times during their field experiences. PUBH 491 for 3 credits requires the completion of 60 hours of placement , while PUBH 481 and 486 require 75 hours and more extensive reflections. Audra Hamrick, the Director of Public Health Practice and Service Learning, coordinates and oversees all coursework and activities aligned with student field placements. PUB H 481 wi ll be offered for the first time in the spring: we have not yet had students in this curriculum to the point where they needed this course. Students in the Community and Population Health Area of Emphasis and the Public Health Sciences Area of Emphasis register for Public Health Field Experience and Capstone (PUBH 481 or 491). In a unique partnership, the S PH identifies local public and community health agencies for student field placements by partnering with the WVU Center for Service and Learning (CS&L) , https://service.wvu.edu/home/about . \"The WVU Center for Service and Learning commits to building a campus and community that encourages social action connected to academic success, integrity and growt h in civic responsibility.\" The Center's iServe program , https://iserve.wvu.edu/user/login/?return=%2Fuser%2Fgroups%2F%3Fgroup%3Duur4VuUDphivDA T%2FpTEVaWaTK3Ot172%2BUeU%2B9CLNydbHNUYBn3RG8iWtd%2BX1wml1KTsS95jRyJ%2F NIH8mt6VwJA%3D%3D links students electronically to community partners for the service learning contracts, reporting of hours, and preceptor evaluations. Students in the Patient Navigation Area of Emphasis register for Patient Navigator Experiential Agency Rotations and Capstone (PUBH 486). Rotations for Patient Navigation students are identified through contacts at WVU Medicine. Students work with clinical care teams to assist patients/individuals in reducing and eliminating barriers to health care access and in negotiating complex health delivery systems. 152 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH The Culminating Experience or Capstone is embedded in the Field Placement courses and requires student to develop, practice, and present a poster detailing their field placement experience, reflections, and outcomes. This includes sections on: a. the agency, their services, service regions and target populations aligned with reflection #1). b. the issue addressed with a brief background and some information that explains why this is a problem (locally, statewide, nationally, globally), and which includes statistics or data points supporting the scope of the issue (aligns with reflection #1) c. student contributions, tasks performed and/or activities (aligns with reflection #2) d. reflection on the experience and how public health courses, knowledge and skills contributed to the experience (aligns with reflections #2 and #3) e. student's future goals (professional, education, other) The poster is presented at the end of the student's final semester to a gathering of faculty, staff, community partners, students, alumni, and other stakeholders. The posters are formally graded by SPH faculty (all are invited) using the Poster Presentation Grading Form. Additional information regarding experiential learning opportunities can be found on our website, https://publichealth.wvu.edu/students/experiential -learning/ .

MPH Program Length An MPH degree requires at least 42 semester -credits, 56 quarter -credits or the equivalent for completion. Schools use university definitions for credit hours. 1) Provide information about the minimum credit -hour requirements for all MPH degree options. If the university uses a unit of academic credit or an academic term different from the standard semester or quarter, explain the difference and present an equivalency in table or narrative form. The Master of Public Health program at West Vir ginia University consists of a minimum of 42 credit hours. 2) Define a credit with regard to classroom/contact hours. West Virginia University courses offered for credit are based on semester hours. Semesters are fifteen weeks long plus one week for final exams. A single credit hour is equivalent to fifty minutes per week of guided instruction within the classroom.

Bachelor's Degree Program Length A public health bachelor's degree requires completion of a total number of credit units commensurate with other similar degree schools in the university. Schools use university definitions for credit hours. 1) Provide information about the minimum credit -hour requirements for all bachelor's degree options. If the university uses a unit of academic credit or an academic term different from t he standard semester or quarter, explain the difference and present an equivalency in table or narrative form. All students are required to complete a minimum of 120 credit hours for the public health bachelor's degree (see WVU Undergraduate Catalog , http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/schoolofpublichealth/publichealth/#majortext ). 2) Define a credit with regard to classroom/contact hours. West Virginia University courses offered for credit are based on semester hours. Semesters are fifteen weeks long plus one week for final exams. A single credit hour is equivalent to fifty minutes per week of guided instruction within the classroom. An hour of preparation, or related activity outside of the classroom, is equivalent to sixty minutes per week. http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/programs_courses__enrollment/#credithourstext 3) Describe policies and procedures for acceptance of coursework completed at other institutions, including community colleges. The Transfer Equivalency Self Service (TESS) system (https://admissions.wvu.edu/how -to- apply/transfer -students/transferring -course- credit -to-wvu) allows current and future students to see how credit from other institutions will transfer, and how that credit will apply to a degree at WVU. TESS is designed to make the transfer process easier and more transparent. Once a course form another academic institution is approved for equivalent credit, it remains in the system for all students completing the same course. In all cases, the application of transfer credit toward completion of a bachelor's degree is determined by the school or college upon enrollment. The student's academic department will determine which credits will be used to meet degree requirements. WVU accepts all \"college- level courses\" from \"accepted regionally accredited institutions. \" Grades and credits are transferable for college- level courses from regionally accredited U.S. institutions. Generally speaking, lab course credit that is earned through self -taught, online or correspondence instruction will not transfer to WVU as laborat ory credit. Such credits transfer as open credit or elective credit, and degree programs will decide how to apply the credit to degree requirements. Credit hours do not change when transferred to WVU. For example, if 3 credit hours were earned in a Compute r Science course at another institution and the WVU equivalent course is 4 credit hours, the student will only receive 3 transfer credit hours. However, course credits taken at institutions that are on the quarter system will be adjusted to fit the semester system at WVU. The Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Studies is designated as the reviewer of all potential course equivalents representative of public health knowledge that are not already in TESS. Students may enter courses (with syllabus) into the Transfer Equivalency Review Request (TERR). The Assistant Dean then reviews the syllabus to determine if at least 70% of the learning outcomes are consistent with an existing public health courses at WVU. If there is compatibility, the course is approved. If 164 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH there is less than 70% compatibility, the course is not approved as an equivalent and is added to a student's general electives. 4) If applicable, provide articulation agreements with community colleges that address acceptance of coursework. There are curr ently no articulation agreements. 5) Provide information about the minimum credit -hour requirements for coursework for the major in at least two similar bachelor's degree programs in the home institution. WVU requires all undergraduate degrees to comprise 120 credit hours (http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/degree_regulations/#requirementstext ), unless a greater number is required for discipline- specific accredi tation. The BS in Public Health requirements of 120 credit hours is equivalent to the BS in Exercise Physiology (http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/schoolofmedi cine/exphys/#majortext ) , a pre -med program BA in History (http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/eberlycollegeofartsandsciences/history/#majortext ) . 165 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH D17. Academic Public Health Master's Degrees These students also complete coursework and other experiences, outside of the major paper or project, that substantively address scientific and analytic approaches to discovery and translation of public health knowledge in the context of a population health framework. Finally, students complete coursework that provides instruction in the foundational public health knowledge at an appropriate level of complexity. This instruction may be delivered through online, in- person or blended methodologies, but it must meet the following requirements while covering the defined content areas. The school identifies at least one requir ed assessment activity for each of the foundational public health learning objectives. The school validates academic public health master's students' foundational public health knowledge through appropriate methods. Deletions: The Online MPH Program and O nline MS in School Health Education Programs no longer admitted students in 2017. This Self -Study reporting coincides with the need to present current information. This serves as our notice of a substantive change ( per correspondence with Ally D'Orio* ).

Note: these competencies are defined by the school and are distinct from the foundational public health learning objectives defined in this criterion. Table D17 -2: Assessment of Competencies for Academic Master's Degrees in Public Health Fields (MS in Biostatistics) Competency Course number(s) and name(s) Describe specific assessment opportunity 1. Assess foundational concepts of probability and statistical inference. BIOS 610: Biostatistical Theory & Methods 1 BIOS 612: Biostatistical Theory & Methods 2 Students are given regular small assignments (take- home or in- class) in which they must use common probability distributions to calculate probabilities, derive important results. In BIOS 610 this may be quantities such as expected values and variances, as well as maximum likelihood estimators. In BIOS 612 the content will expand to include derivation of basic statistical methods from first principles, and power calculations. In both courses, multiple approaches will be used, including analytical (e.g. via calculus), computational (e.g. numerical methods such as bootstrap or Newton -169 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Raphson), and graphical (e.g. visualizing likelihoods). 2. Analyze clinical and public health data using descriptive biostatistical methods. BIOS 610: Biostatistical Theory & Methods 1 BIOS 612: Biostatistical Theory & Methods 2 In multiple homework assignments , students will use a large Public Health database (e.g., NHANES) and apply statistical concepts to describe patterns or investigate claims such as \"Does it appear that men and women tend to have different BMI?\" or \"Does there appear to be an association between blood pressure and BMI?\". 3. Distinguish appropriate basic inferential statistical analyses and summarize their results. BIOS 610: Biostatistical Theory & Methods 1 BIOS 612: Biostatistical Theory & Methods 2 Students are assigned an open -ended project in which they must analyze a real -world dataset using topics from the current course. In BIOS 610, this may include descriptive summari es, selecting appropriate probability distributions and assessing fit, estimation of parameters, and resampling- based intervals. For BIOS 612, this should also include statistical testing and power analysis. 4. Manage standard statistical software to efficiently manage data structures. BIOS 611: Data Management & Reporting Students are assigned a project in which they will apply statistical reporting methods to manipulate a large Public Health database, creating compelling graphical and tabular summaries t o investigate a scientific finding. Results will be compared to published scientific findings. Software used may include R, Python, SAS, SQL, or other current, relevant software as determined by the instructor. 5. Summarize central concepts of statistical theory and inference. BIOS 610: Biostatistical Theory & Methods 1 BIOS 612: Biostatistical Theory & Methods 2 Students are assigned a statistical concept related to the course content. For BIOS 610 this may be a new probability distribution, an estimator, or similar, while for BIOS 612 it may be a statistical test or similar method. The students must research the topic and write a short report on the background and mathematical details of their assi gned topic, with a focus on connecting to course content such as expected values, estimators, and methods. They will make a short presentation of their report. 6. Develop appropriate plans to analyze standard continuous data in order to make valid inferences. BIOS 620: Applied Linear Models Exams : Given information on the continuous dataset (such as statistical program output), interpret model output, determine which model would be preferred (model comparison), and interpret the model in the scientific context. Discuss potential departures from the regression assumptions using diagnostic plots. Discuss various potential modeling strategies if an assumption is violated. 7. Develop appropriate plans to analyze standard categorical data in order to make vali d inferences. BIOS 621: Categorical Data Analysis Final Exam - Take a dataset, construct contingency tables and make appropriate inferences. Model outcome variables (both binary and count data) and summarize the 170 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH results appropriately. Write up as one would a research paper. 8. Communicate effectively, in writing and verbally, with substantive investigators and members of the community when assisting in the design of research studies as well as the results of statistical analyses. BIOS 628: Biostatistics Practicum Final report - Over the course of the semester, a written report of analysis will be developed in conjunction with input from the substantive investigators and members of the community. Report should be written with a na\u00efve reader in mind with prac tical and applied explanations of analysis and results. Final presentation - The written presentation should also be orally presented to the substantive investigators/community members. 4) Identify required coursework and other experiences that address the variety of public health research methods employed in the context of a population health framework to foster discovery and translation of public health knowledge and a brief narrative that explains how the instruction and assessment is equivalent to that typically associated with a three- semester -credit course. A comprehensive list of required coursework and potential electives is provided above. In addition to the broad exposure related to public health research in a variety of fields that is provided through the PUBH 659 - Public Health Foundations course, students in the MS in Biostatistics receive extensive methodological training (Data Management & Reporting, Applied Linear Models, and Categorical Data Analysis are all required courses). Most also take elective courses in survival analysis (BIOS 622), clinica l trials (BIOS 663), and/or meta- analysis 663). All MS in Biostatistics students complete a research- based final project through their Biostatistics Practicum course (BIOS 628), with many opting for additional research training through the program's thesis option and the associated requirement for a faculty -supervised research course (BIOS 697 - Research). 5) Briefly summarize policies and procedures relating to production and assessment of the final research project or paper. As part of the required p racticum course and in preparation for either the thesis or non- thesis option, students work in a practical setting for a minimum of 180 hours, applying principles and skills learned in classes to address research questions that arise in that setting. Students can use these practical and research experiences are the basis for either their thesis or final project. 6) Provide links to handbooks or webpages that contain the full list of policies and procedures governing production and assessment of the final research project or paper for each degree school. Policies and procedures related to the MS in Biostatistics can be found at: https://publichealth.hsc.wvu.edu/students/student -resources/student -handbooks/mph- and-ms- student -handbooks/ 171 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 7) Include completed, graded samples of deliverables associated with the major paper or project. The school must provide at least 10% of the number produced in the last three years or five examples, whichever is greater. Please see section D17 of the ERF. 8) Briefly explain how the school ensures that the instruction and assessment in basic public health knowledge is generally equivalent to the instruction and assessment typically associated with a three- semester -credit course. The foundational learning objectives are accomplished through the School's 3 credit -hour PUBH 659 - Foundations of Public Health course, required of all graduate students not enrolled i n the MPH program. 9) Include the most recent syllabus for any course listed in the documentation requests above, or written guidelines for any required elements that do not have a syllabus. Please see section D17 of the ERF. 10) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: The MS in Biostatistics include the deep and expansive methodological training. Students are prepared for jobs in industry or to pursue more advanced training (or both). The BIOS faculty offer a breadth of professional experiences and expertise. Due to their extensive connections and funded projects within the Health Sciences Center, the University, and beyond, MS in BIOS students are able to connect with professionals and work on applied projects in a manner that afford them excellent experiential and applied education. The School of Public Health's collaboration with other health professions schools in the academic medical center and its affiliated institutes (e.g . the Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute and the Betty Puskar Cancer Institute), as well as collaborative opportunities with WVU Medicine and its flagship hospital (part of the same health sciences campus) and a regional National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) office (also the same campus) provide exceptional practical educational experiences and research opportunities to the faculty and students. Weaknesses: The program has not identified any weaknesses pertaining to this criterion. Plans: Improvement plans include more robust and intentional industry involvement in program refinements and/or curriculum enhancements that may be identified moving forward. 172 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 173 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH D18. Academic Public Health Doctoral Degrees These students also complete coursework and other experiences, outside of the major paper or project, that substantively address scientific and analytic approaches to discovery an d translation of public health knowledge in the context of a population health framework. These students complete doctoral -level, advanced coursework and other experiences that distinguish the school of study from a master's degree in the same field. The school defines appropriate policies for advancement to candidacy, within the context of the institution. Finally, students complete coursework that provides instruction in the foundational public health knowledge at an appropriate level of complexity. Thi s instruction may be delivered through online, in- person or blended methodologies, but it must meet the following requirements while covering the defined content areas. The school identifies at least one required assessment activity for each of the foundational public health learning objectives. The school validates academic doctoral students' foundational public health knowledge through appropriate methods. 1) List the curricular requirements for each non- DrPH doctoral degree in the unit of accreditat ion, EXCLUDING requirements associated with the final research project. The list must indicate (using shading) each required curricular element that a) is designed expressly for doctoral, rather than master's, students or b) would not typically be associat ed with completion of a master's degree in the same area of study. The school may present accompanying narrative to provide context and information that aids reviewers' understanding of the ways in which doctoral study is distinguished from master's -level study. This narrative is especially important for institutions that do not formally distinguish master's - level courses from doctoral -level courses. The school will present a separate list for each degree program and concentration as appropriate. The School of Public Health offers PhD degrees in Public Health Sciences with three concentrations: Epidemiology (EPID), Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences (OEHS), and Social and Behavioral Health Sciences (SBHS). Students can enroll into the program as \"Regular standing\" (students with bachelor's degrees or non- relevant master's degrees) or \"Advanced standing\" (students with MPH or strongly related master degrees). Under normal circumstances, program completion is expected to take around 4 years for full -time regular standing students, or around 2 years of course work and about 2 years of independent research, and about 3 years for full -time advanced standing students, or around 1 year of course work and about 2 years of independent research. The first year of coursework for regular standing students consists mostly of 600- level courses, many of which are also offered at the master's level, with the second year mostly devoted to 700- level courses that are exclusively offered to doctoral level students. A r egular standing student admitted to the PhD program will take a minimum of 75 credit hours. Incoming advanced standing students are subject to an assessment conducted by the respective Department Chair, the Departmental PhD Advisor, and the Director of the PhD Program, to evaluate which course( s) can be waived from the PhD Core within each department. This c ould result in a maximum of 20 credits being either transferred based on previous graduate studies or waived for advanced standing and will vary between students based on prior coursework, recency, and experience. 174 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Table D18- A below includes a breakdown of all core courses (i.e., non- electives) for full -time regular standing students within the three program concentrations and overlap in cour se requirements across the three departments.

Students enrolled in the PhD Program in Public Health Sciences are trained in the theory and application of research methods aligned with their program concentration; Epidemiology, Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, and Social and Behavioral Health Sciences. Each concentr ation requires students to complete a set of methods -based courses and both OEHS and SBHS also include research rotations as part of the PhD training. A brief description within each concentration follows: Epidemiology Different from Occupational and Envi ronmental Health Sciences, and Social and Behavioral Health Sciences, Epidemiology is a methods -based subject. The dominant part of the PhD Curriculum in Epidemiology is therefore attributed to a range of issues that can be broadly described as training in research methodology including study design, statistical analyses, and data handling. Courses include among others PUBH 611: Epidemiology for Public Health Practice which is an overview course of epidemiological methods and EPID 712: Quantitative Methods in Epidemiology which covers a variety of applied quantitative methods, detection of confounding, and interpretation of research findings. Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences The Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences concentration in the Public Health Sciences PhD program is for scientist -practitioners and emphasizes the understanding of the toxic effect of exposures in the environment, the environmental hazards associated with injuries and the monitoring and evaluation methods that ar e important for quantifying the potential risk of those events. Methods - based training includes courses such as: PUBH 611: Epidemiology for Public Health Practice which is an overview course of epidemiological methods, PUBH 612: Research Translation and Ev aluation in Public Health Practice, which introduces quantitative and qualitative methods as applied to public health practice as well as methods for evaluating public health programs and policies, and OEHS 620, Occupational and Environmental Hazard Assess ment, which addresses assessment of common occupational and environmental exposures. Social and Behavioral Health Sciences The Department of Social and Behavioral Health Sciences has been described as the \"intervention arm\" of the School of Public Health. In the PhD program students learn about theory, design, application and evaluation of micro, mezzo and macro- type interventions. Methods -based courses include for example SBHS 715: Intervention Design which is an overview course of social and behavioral theory and applications for intervention design, and SBHS 760: Survey Research Methods, which provides students with an overview, knowledge and skills to design and conduct survey research. 182 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 5) Briefly summarize policies and procedures relating to productio n and assessment of the final research project or paper. Once students have completed all of the required coursework, they must pass a qualifying examination in order to continue in the program. The qualifying exam is based on core public health and disci pline - specific material and is administered within the student's home department. Successful passage of the qualifying examination signifies competence in public health sciences and the student's major field of study and indicates a readiness to engage in independent research. The qualifying examination is given by the student's dissertation committee in the OEHS & SBHS departments and by an exam committee in the EPID department and consist of two components: a written exam and an oral defense of the written exam. Students can only sign up for dissertation credits after passing both the written and oral components of the qualifying exam which is usually conducted at the end of the 4th semester for regular standing students and by the end of the 2nd semester for advanced standing students. Once a student officially passes the qualifying exam he/she is expected to devote all their time to working on a dissertation proposal, which culminates in a Dissertation Proposal Defense. Usually drafting, revising and defending the proposal takes one full semester. The dissertation proposal defense serves as the candidacy exam. In a private session that includes the complete dissertation committee, the student will defend the proposal. Upon successful defense of the proposal, which is graded as pass or fail, he/she will be admitted to candidacy. The student's research will be compiled into a written dissertation. Two dissertation formats are permitted; a traditional 5- 6-chapter book format or a Journal Article Format (JAF), which consists of a series of three publishable manuscripts based on the s tudent's dissertation research. The PhD program emphasizes peer -reviewed research publications as the dissertation product because of their positive impact on students' skills and their post -graduation success. The decision of which format to use is made b y the student in close consultation with the dissertation committee chair. Prior to dissertation defense each student is required to have a minimum of one first -author publication based on the dissertation research either under review (OEHS) or accepted to be published (EPID & SBHS) in a peer -review journal. The dissertation will be defended in a public forum that includes all dissertation committee members, who must sign the dissertation approval form for the dissertation to be completed. The defense mus t be announced to the entire Health Sciences Center, and students are required to ensure that fliers are posted around the HSC campus that announce the details of the public defense. Once the dissertation committee agrees the student is ready to defend and they have met the first -author publication requirement, the student will take the following steps to set up and conduct their defense: 1. Three weeks prior to the defense, the student must provide the final reading copy of the dissertation to all members of the dissertation committee. 2. Two weeks prior to defense, a Shuttle Sheet Request form must be handed into the Office of Student Services signed by all dissertation committee members, which signals the students status as ready for defense. 3. One week prior to defense the student must announce the details of the defense to the University. In order to pass the dissertation defense only one unfavorable vote among members of the dissertation committee is permitted. If the committee determines the student has passed the defense, all members 183 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH will sign a Shuttle Sheet, which documents the successful defense of the dissertation. The student should also sign the form and bring it to the SPH Office of Student Services for processing. If the committee determines that the student has not passed the defense, he/she will be given detailed instructions as to what revisions and further steps are needed an d a deadline by which revisions must be received for further review by the committee chair. These details will be given to the student in writing no later than 10 calendar days from the date of the original dissertation defense. Students may not apply for graduation until the defense has been passed. Once the defense has been passed, the written dissertation must be submitted in accordance with the WVU policy regulating electronic submission of theses and dissertations. 6) Provide links to handbooks or webp ages that contain the full list of policies and procedures governing production and assessment of the final research project or paper for each degree school. The PhD Program Student Handbook: https://publichealth.hsc.wvu.edu/students/student - resources/student -handbooks/phd- student -handbooks/ School of Public Health PhD Program catalogue: http://catalog.wvu.edu/graduate/publichealth/#Doctoral PhD Programs within Include completed, graded samples of deliverables associated with the advanced research project. The school must provide at least 10% of the number produced in the last three years or five examples, whichever is greater. Please see section D18 of the ERF to view six dissertation examples produced in the last three years. 8) Briefly explain how the school ensures that the instruction and assessment in introductory public health knowledge is generally equivalent to the instruction and assessment typically associated with a three semester -credit course. All students are required to take courses that introduce the history and basic concepts of public health. All students are required to take PUBH 610, Contemporary Foundations of Public Health Practice, which examines the history of public health, from its roots in sanitation to c urrent efforts to broadly improve population health. Each of the five core disciplines, epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, social and behavioral sciences, and health policy and management are introduced, as are their relationships to each other. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is emphasized. Quantitative and qualitative research designs are covered as well as infectious diseases, tuberculosis, and risk management. For most students with advanced standing status at program entry (MP H or strongly relevant master's degrees) this usually means that they already have generated the foundational knowledge so introductory courses are not required. However, if the foundational knowledge is 184 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH deemed lacking via review of prior course work and/or training, they will be required to pass a foundational course. 9) Include the most recent syllabus for any course listed in the documentation requests above, or written guidelines for any required elements that do not have a syllabus. Please see section D 18 of the ERF to view course syllabi. 10) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: The School has recruited and retained an outstanding faculty with demonstrable achievements in the areas of research and practice scholarship that translates well to student instruction. Weaknesses: none noted 185 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH D19. All Remaining Degrees Students enrolled in any of the SPH's degree programs that are not addressed in Criteria D2, D3, D9, D17 or D18 complete coursework that provides instruction in the foundational public health knowledge at a level of complexity appropriate to the level of the student's degr ee program. The instruction and assessment of students' foundational public health knowledge are equivalent in depth to the instruction and assessment that would typically be associated with a three- semester - credit class, regardless of the number of credi ts awarded for the experience or the mode of delivery. Beginning in Fall 2020, the School of Public Health will begin offering a new Master of Health Administration (MHA) degree, a substantive but strategically important change for the School of Public Health. This two -year (full -time), residential program consists of 46- 48 credit hours (depending on selected electives) and was developed with the intention of seeking program -level accreditation buy the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME). The program was approved by the university during the Fall 2019 (November 8, 2019) for launch the following academic year. While all MHA students will take the core Foundations of Public Health course offered by the School of Public Health - ensuring instruction in and assessment of the foundational public health learning objectives. Additionally, while MHA students will have competencies, courses, and content specific to the discipline of health administration, a distinguishing feature of the new WVU MHA program will be the intentional integration of the MHA and MPH (particularly the Health Policy concentration) programs through several shared courses. This deep degree of interprofessional education is purposed to assure WVU MHA students have a deep grounding in the concepts and practices of public health. The initial discussion of creating a Master of Health Administration degree within the School of Public Health (SPH) began in 2017. Leaders from WVU Medicine approached WVU Health Sciences Center and SPH leaders about the need for the degree to fill vital workforce development and leadership opportunities throughout the WVU Medicine system. SPH leaders also came to understand similar needs while discussing the potential program with other health systems and public health organizations throughout West Virginia. Planning for the program progressed as SPH leaders consulted with leaders from nationally -ranked, CAHME -accredited MHA programs. The SPH subsequently conducted a national search for an Associate Dean for Professional Programs (hired in Fall 2018), who was tasked with developing and launching the MHA program. As part of this process, the Associate Dean built an advisory council of local, regional, and national healthcare leaders who have helped inform the faculty on the selection of program competencies and proposed curriculum, as well as the program's mission, vision, and values. The primary audience for this program will be working clinical and administrative professionals in healthcare, health services, and public health. Increasingly, these leaders require additional skills and credentials to advance in their professional careers. The proposed MHA program will provide the necessary training to meet that need. We also expect that some more traditional students will seek the MHA degree. The program's competencies (learning outcomes) and curriculum will readily prepare these students for more entry -level management and middle management opportunities within a variety of health administration settings. 186 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MHA Curriculum & Full -Time Plan of Study Fall 1 Credits PUBH 659 Foundations of Public Health 3 HPML 623 Healthcare Finance 3 PUBH 640* Leadership & Collaboration in Public Health* 3 HPML 682 Managing Quality Improvement in Healthcare 3 HPML 696* Graduate Seminar: Part 1* 1 Spring 1 Credits HPML 620* Managing Robust Public Health Organizations* 3 HPML 610 Health Economics for Population Health 3 HPML 655 Health Services Project Management 3 HPML 656 Managerial Epidemiology & Strategy 3 HPML 696* Graduate Seminar: Part 2* 1 Summer 1 Credits HPML 626 Internship 3 Fall 2 Credits HPML 622 Analytic Methods for HPML 3 HPML 650 Prof. Issues in Health Administration: Health Policy 1 HPML 652 Prof. Issues in Health Administration: Law & Ethics 1 --- Elective 2-3 HPML 696* Graduate Seminar: Integrative Capstone in Health Administration 3 HPML 653 Prof. Issues in Health Administration: Talent & Culture 1 HPML 654 Prof. Issues in Health Admin.: Health Info. & Mgmt.

Syllabi for new courses are being developed through the university's curricular approval process and will be finalized during the Spring 2020 semester. The MHA programs focuses on 27 distinct competencies (learning outcomes in the university's vernacular) across 5 domains. These are detailed below. A matrix mapping competencies to specific courses in the curricular is attached in the Electronic Resource File. MHA Competencies/Learning Outcomes Communication and Relationship Management 1.

Given the expansive nature of the professional health administration field, a strong initial and on- going enrollment is expected. Demand is strong nationwide among traditional students, working professionals, and clinicians seeking more senior leadership r oles within healthcare. The best MHA programs nationally admit between 20- 25 students annually. As outlined in below, the projected enrollment for the MHA program should reach 25 within the first four years (roughly 25% annual increase) and be maintained at that level thereafter, for a total annual enrollment of approximately 50 students. As necessitated by market factors, additional tracks (accelerated, executive, and/or dual - degree etc.) could be established once the program is accredited. MHA program projected annual enrollment, Years 1-5 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 New 15 18 21 25 25 Returning -- 15 18 21 25 TOTAL 15 33 39 46 50 The MHA program will conduct an annual review of program outcomes. Important measures the program will track include: percent of students graduating on- time (2 years for full -time students; 6 years or earlier for part -time students); percent of graduates obtaining employment in the field within 90-days of graduation, percent of graduates obtaining administrative fellowships, and percent of graduates who are accepted into additional graduate or professional programs. To be sure the program is building the health administration workforce of West Virginia, the program will also annually track the percent of students matriculating into the program from West Virginia, as well as the percent of graduates who go on to field- related employment within the state. The MHA program will seek accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME). We expect the program to enter candidacy during the Fall 2020 semester; and we will submit for accreditation after the initial cohort of students graduates in Spring 189 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2022. We further expect the CAHME site visit to follow during Fall 2022, with acc reditation coming the following Spring (Spring 2023). The school identifies at least one required assessment activity for each of the foundational public health learning objectives. 1) Provide a matrix in the format of Template D19- 1 that indicates the required assessment opportunities for each of the defined foundational public health learning objectives (1- 12). Typically, the school will present a separate matrix for each degree progra m, but matrices may be combined if requirements are identical.

Strengths /Weaknesses/Plans: Given that the MHA program will not launch until Fall 2020, we cannot provide an assessment of strengths or weaknesses at this time. We do believe the intentional integration of the MHA and MPH programs and the associated interdisciplinary/interprofessional learning will become a strength and a distinguishing factor of both programs. The MHA program will continue to m onitor the effectiveness of the public health foundations courses (PUBH 659) related to the delivering and assessing the defined foundational public health learning objectives. 192 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 193 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH D20.

Strengths: We have an excellent complement of faculty to fulfill our teaching, research and service mission. Weaknesses: None noted 201 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH E2. Integration of Faculty with Practice Experience To assure a broad public health perspective, the school employs faculty who have professional experience in settings outside of academia and have demonstrated competence in public health practice. School s encourage faculty to maintain ongoing practice links with public health agencies, especially at state and local levels. To assure the relevance of curricula and individual learning experiences to current and future practice needs and opportunities, schools regularly involve public health practitioners and other individuals involved in public health work through arrangements that may include adjunct and part -time faculty appointments, guest lectures, involvement in committee work, mentoring students, etc. 1) Describe the manner in which the public health faculty complement integrates perspectives from the field of practice, including information on appointment tracks for practitioners, if applicable. Faculty with significant practice experience outside of that which is typically associated with an academic career should also be identified. SPH faculty interact with numerous organizations locally, throughout the state and region, and nationally/internationally. These interactions allow the faculty to integrate their perspectives of interacting with the practice community, as well as sharing the practice community's perspective on the delivery of public health and population health services. The interactions with the multiple practice communities allow SP H faculty a ready source of guest lecturers to enhance the classroom learning of students. Adjunct faculty also provide perspectives from public health practice. The seminar is noteworthy; however, greater involvement with the county health department is an opportunity for increasing integration of perspectives from the field. The SPH faculty appointment categories includes a \"Clinical/Health Sciences Educator\" that is non- tenure earning and allows for appointment of faculty with baccalaureate, master's, or a terminal degree. The appointment requires significant contributions in education and service, with reasonable contributions in research/scholarship. Several faculty bring prior fulltime public health practice experience to their academic careers with the SPH (see section E2 of the ERF to view faculty CVs ). These experiences vary widely and include military environmental and public health, county and state health departments, non- profit organizations, legislative offices, oc cupational medicine clinics, community mental health centers, members of local boards of health, state environmental regulatory agencies, domestic violence centers, and family resource centers. 202 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Information regarding specific faculty that have practical experience prior to joining WVU.

Faculty Instructional Effectiveness The school ensures that systems, policies and procedures are in place to document that all faculty (full-time and part -time) are current in their areas of instructional responsibility and in pedagogical methods. The school establishes and consistently applies procedures for evaluating faculty competence and performance in instruction. The school supports pr ofessional development and advancement in instructional effectiveness. 1) Describe the means through which the school ensures that faculty are informed and maintain currency in their areas of instructional responsibility. The description must address both pri mary instructional and non- primary instructional faculty and should provide examples as relevant. All faculty members' time and effort (FTE's) is formally evaluated once a year through a required process of submitting their updated accomplishments to Digital Measures to create the Annual Productivity Report. This report is utilized by each faculty members' department chair to determine relevance in their respective area of instruction. This includes the department chair review of grant submissions, manuscript development and submissions, contributions to the state- of-the-field, and service on external committees and editorial boards. Chairs review information with faculty members in face- to-face meetings that take place after December 31 but prior to March 30. Written summary feedback is shared with the faculty member, with copies to the Dean and the Senior Associate Dean of Academic Affairs. (see example in sectionE3 of the ERF) A l l r e v i e w s t a k e p l a c e p r i o r t o t h e development of the next academic year schedule to ensure appropriate alignment with instruction. The School has a fully articulated Standard Operating Guideline (SOG) for non- primary instructional faculty. The process f or Adjuncts with any teaching responsibilities begins with a Department Chair letter that describes the role of the adjunct in teaching and/or mentoring. Faculty must review the request and an updated CV for the Adjunct candidate and formally vote \"yes\" or \"no\" for the candidate to be granted a teaching appointment. Departmental A dministrative Assistant 's provide documentation of the vote to the Senior Associate Dean for Academic A ffairs. After the review of materials used in the decision- making process, the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs makes a recommendation to the Dean as to whether or not an appointment should be made. The Dean communicates directly with the adjunct candidate. In the Fall of 2017, the Chief of Staff on behalf of the Dean's Office and in consultation with the Senior Associate Deans request ed transcripts of all faculty, including non- primary instructional faculty, and anyone with a teaching role in the School. Furthermore, this request is included in every faculty offer letter . Transcripts are uploaded to the faculty member's file in Digital Measures. The School of Public Health defines non- instructional faculty as adjunct. To view the guidelines on offering an adjunct appointment, please see section E3 of the ERF. 2) Describe the school's procedures for evaluating faculty instructional effectiveness. Include a description of the processes used for student course evaluations and peer evaluations, if applicable. Student Evaluation of Instruction reports (SEI's) are uploaded into Digital Measures so that as faculty complete their productivity reports information is automatically populated in the system. Issues identified based on student feedback are communicated directly to the respective program director with a copy to the Senior Associate Dean of Academic Affairs. The Senior Associate Dean for 208 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Academic Affairs contacts the Department Chair and discuss options for remediation which may include removal from a course. 3) Describe available university and programmatic support for continuous improvement in faculty's instructional roles. Provide three to five examples of school involvement in or use of these resources. The description must address both primary instructional faculty and non- primary instructional faculty.

Teaching excellence is a priority at WVU. Resources in the last three years to support the teaching enterprise are detailed below. All faculty at WVU except those with explicit research or clinical responsibilities are required to teach. During faculty evaluations done by the Promotion and Tenure Committee, the review of teaching is equivalent to research and service. All primary teac hing faculty are required to have \" Significant Contributions in Teaching \". On page 6 of our current promotion and tenure guidelines, it states, \"All faculty (except those in the research and service specialty tracks) should have substantial involvement in educational programs, such as designing, instructing in, and evaluating educational programs and participating in department educational activities including committees. Education involves the dissemination of knowledge and the stimulation of critical t hinking. Education includes not only traditional modes of instruction such as the classroom lecture, but also mentoring and precepting students, fellows, and faculty, on- line and distance education, clinical, laboratory, and practicum instruction; thesis and dissertation direction; facilitation of group learning; evaluation and critique of student self -directed learning; participation in various forums for continuing education, patient education, and non- traditional instruction; presentations in seminars, G rand Rounds and conferences; and advising. Outreach educational activities such as on- line education or instruction outside of the SPH facility as part of job duties should be evaluated as part of the educational outcomes.\" 210 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 5) Select at least three indicat ors, with one from each of the listed categories that are meaningful to the school and relate to instructional quality. Describe the school's approach and progress over the last three years for each of the chosen indicators. In addition to at least three f rom the lists in the criteria, the school may add indicators that are significant to its own mission and context. The three indicators that are meaningful to the program and relates to instructional quality are: Faculty currency External reviews of proposed or existing courses or curricula, outside of normal university processes (Normal university processes include regularly scheduled, university -mandated program reviews and routine curriculum committee reviews of new courses.) The S PH has a long history of working with the Curriculum Committee to review course proposals, update course syllab i, review course pre- requisites , adding or deleting majors, etc. In addition, courses and curricula relevant to the needs of the public heal th workforce are reviewed by external constituents and collaborative partners. Specific examples over the last three years include: Director of Kanawha Charleston Health Department (Dr. Mike Brumage, 2017) review of revised coursework for the Practice- based Experience Leadership Council review of CEPH 2016 changes in MPH WVU Health Systems Administrative Leadership review of the proposed Patient Navigator Program (Frank Briggs, etc. 2016) Deputy Director of NIOSH and Dawn Castillo review of workforce and injury courses and NIOSH Scholar in Residence (2017- 2018) David McClure review of MHA (2018) The new Bachelor of Science program in Health Services, Management and L eadership reviewed by members of the Leadership Council. Annual or other regular reviews of faculty productivity, relation of scholarship to instruction All faculty are evaluated annually to evaluate productivity. Teaching and Educational scholarship are defined and highlight ed in the WVU Promotion and Tenure Guidelines , http://wvufaculty.wvu.edu/ , as well as those guidelines for the SPH, http://publichealth.hsc.wvu.edu/media/4890/sph_p_and_t - current_guidelines -002.pdf .

Students gain exposure to the roles and responsibilities of the public health workforce through guest lectures, experiential learning activities and discussions with pro fessionals in the field. Students assess their own interests, skills, and personality to explore and describe their own career goals. The course syllabus is available to view in section E3- School Outcomes of the ERF. Courses that integrate service learning, as defined by the school or program Ms. Audra Hamrick, Assistant Professor SBHS took MPH students to conference with external partner to provide exposure to NGO's that tackle health issues. In Charleston, WV, MPH students participated in the 2019 Center for Children's Justice Handle with Care Conference on October 16- 18, 2019. The students helped convene sessions/collect evaluations as well as attended sessions on multiple topics and network ed with government and non-profit agencies that tackle public health issues . Courses that integrate community -based projects Associate Professor, Dr. Christiaan Abildso, offers SBHS 613/SBHS 763 Program Evaluation in Public Health for graduate students. Both master and doctor al students gain practical experience by engaging stakeholders to create a program evaluation plan. Assistant Professor, Dr. Diane Gross, and Regional Epidemiologist for Mon County Health Department has fully integrate her practice- based epidemiology course with field experiences at the health department providing both service to the health department and a basis for teaching public health in the workforce from a \"real -time\" perspective. Dr. Ranjita Misra provides extensive collaboration through our work with the Mid- Atlantic Regional Training Center with actual products and deliverables to extramural partners. These experiences are a part of her Community Advocacy and Needs Assessment course (SBHS 617) that she co- teaches with Dr. Geri Dino .

Teaching assistants trained in pedagogical techniques All Graduate Teaching Assistant 's are trained formally, can enroll in teaching practicum and are required to attend the Gr aduate Teaching Assistant Orientation offered by the WVU Teaching and Learning Commons, https://tlcommons.wvu.edu/events -workshops/gta -orientation 213 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 6) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths : Our process and procedures for ensuring that faculty view the scholarship of teaching as a fundamental part of their roles and res ponsibilities at the SPH are well documented and supported by internal and external resources. We have a track -record of engaging external constituents in program delivery and design, especially collaborative partners who might benefit from training in these area as a direct result of certificate programs or course work. Weaknesses: Although the S chool is actively engaged in ongoing solicitation of feedback for course development, and the evaluation of faculty on a systematic basis as part of annual revie ws we currently do not have a formal faculty development plan with SMART GOALS. Plans: In addition to plans for a more formal faculty development structure, the following plans have been articulated to Assistant Professors and those with primary teaching responsibilities\" A Teaching Master Class utilizing the Teaching Public Health textbook (Galeo & Sullivan Eds) A Peer Mentoring Program A Teaching Incentive Plan Work with P& T Committee to require a Teaching Narrative/Portfolio 214 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTION ALLY BLANK 215 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH E4. Faculty Scholarship The school has policies and practices in place to support faculty involvement in scholarly activities. As many faculty as possible are involved in research and scholarly activity in some form, whether funded or unfunded. Ongoing participation in research and scholarly activity ensures that faculty are relevant and current in their field of expertise, that their work is peer reviewed and that they are content experts. The types and extent of faculty research align with university and school missions and relate to the types of degrees offered. Faculty integrate research and scholarship with their instructional activities. Research allows faculty to bring real -world examples into the classroom to update and inspire teaching and provides opportunities for students to engage in research activities, if desired or appropriate for the degree program . 1) Describe the school's definition of and expectations regarding faculty research and scholarly activity. Faculty effort i s allocated to the three missions of the SPH, which are education, research/scholarship, and service. The outcomes in each are evaluated annually. A general definition of research, as provided by the WVU Policies and Procedures for Annual Faculty Evaluation, Promotion and Tenure is: WVU values academic research activities that increase fundamental knowledge within the discipline, creative activities that reach out and serve humankind, and applied research activities that yield tangible benefits to society . Therefore, the impact of an activity is part of the measure of its quality. Historically, the measure of academic research and creative activities has been well defined by each discipline, often through peer -reviewed publications and performances and exhibitions. The significance of translational or applied research that results in public \u2014private partnerships, patents, licensing, and/or other forms of commercialization and entrepreneurial activity should also be part of the evaluation of research. Research may be discipline- focused and individual, or it may be interdisciplinary and collaborative. It is a critical component of the mission of the university, contributing to and expanding the general body of knowledge, thus infusing instruction and pu blic service with rigor and relevance. It validates the concept of the teacher -scholar. Interdisciplinary and collaborative assignments should be identified in the appointment letter when possible, or in annual letters as assignments change. Unit guidel ines should address the evaluative process for these activities. It should be noted that the advising of doctoral students has elements of both teaching and research. In most disciplines, refereed publications (print or electronic) of high quality are ex pected as evidence of scholarly productivity. In some disciplines, the strongest such evidence may appear in published refereed proceedings rather than archival journals; such cases must be recognized in the college/school guidelines. In the arts and sim ilar disciplines, an original contribution of a creative nature relevant to one or more disciplines may be as valuable as a publication of a scholarly book or article. In certain disciplines, the ability to secure funding may be necessary for the realizat ion of scholarly output. Depending upon the discipline, entrepreneurial and commercialization activities related to intellectual property and patents, which benefit the university also demonstrate scholarly output. While quantity of effort and output mus t be sufficient to demonstrate an active and peer - recognized presence in the discipline, quality of research is clearly of great value in determining the 216 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH level of performance. Important evidence of scholarly merit may be either a single work of considerable importance (such as a book or monograph) or a series of smaller, high- quality products such as refereed journal articles constituting a program of worthwhile research. Faculty members are expected to undertake a continuing program of studies, investigations, or creative works. Criteria for the evaluation of research should be clearly stated in the unit guidelines. Performance evaluations should be passed on a holistic assessment of evidence provided in the file. The SPH Guidelines for Faculty Appointment, Promotion, and Tenure (approved May, 2012) currently defines Research/Scholarly Activity as: Research involves the creation and synthesis of knowledge, the creation of new approaches to understanding and explaining phenomena, the development of new insights, the critical appraisal of the past, and the application of knowledge and expertise to address needs in society and in the profession. Research may be discipline- focused and individual, or interdisciplinary and collaborative. Both research/s cholarship productivity and excellence are expected. Scholarship may include scholarship in traditional research activities, education, and service, and must be peer -reviewed and in the public domain. Some examples of scholarship include peer -reviewed ar ticles in journals or conference proceedings, books and book chapters, patents, research- based educational media materials (for example, simulations, tutorials, etc.), developing new academic programs, receiving external grants or contracts for research as a result of written proposals, receiving research awards, and research- based development of software and other products that have a broad impact. Educational scholarship includes contributions to the educational community to advance knowledge in the fiel d. Some examples of educational products include: interactive learning exercises, electronically viewable sets with speaker notes, case studies, and new models and strategies for education. In order to be considered as peer -reviewed, these should be incl uded in peer -reviewed venues or repositories, be evaluated from conference proceedings, education awards, be referenced in peer -reviewed materials, and show how adoption by other faculty including descriptions of how the product has been used as built upon. Importantly, the SPH recognizes and values collaborative research that addresses top health priorities and disparities of WV and Appalachia, and informs the development of improved public health policy and practice. Our current Promotion and Tenure guidelines consist of 11 tracks that have specific guidance as to the evaluation and criteria for Scholarship. Three examples follow: 1. Scientist Collaborator Track 2. Specialty: Research Track (non- tenure) 3. Health Sciences Educator Scientist Track Please see t he SPH P&T Guidelines located in section E4 of the ERF to view the research/scholarship expectations for each track . 217 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2) Describe available university and school support for research and scholarly activities.

In addition to working closely with the academic departments and principal investigators, they also coordinate with the Office of Sponsored Programs and their sponsors. Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology, and Biostatics (CRDEB) Core The Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics (CRDEB) core provides services to clinical and translational researchers throughout the state of West Virginia. CRDEB offers researchers a central means to receive support from a comprehensive group of scientists with extensive biostatistical and epidemiologic expertise. CRDEB core scientists e nhance clinical and translational research by utilizing existing methods and developing new methods in statistical data analysis and research design. Services include grant preparation, design of data collection systems, development and application of experimental and quasi -experimental research designs, and complex analytical methods. 220 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH WVU Libraries The WVU Libraries encompass seven libraries, including the Downtown Campus Library, Evansdale Library, Health Sciences Library (Morgantown), Law Library, Healt h Sciences Library (Charleston), the Mary F. Shipper Library at Potomac State College in Keyser, and the WVU Institute of Technology Library in Beckley. The WVU Health Sciences Center Library supports the schools of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Dentistry , and Public Health at the WVU Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center. The Health Sciences Library has research services librarians available to assist researchers with their project needs. Librarians are available at the Research Services Desk, via a chat feature for instant research assistance, or by individual appointments for in- depth consultations. This library provides access to an extensive collection, allowing users to connect to over 40,000 electronic journals, magazines, and newspapers. In addition, interlibrary loans are available free of charge to all faculty and students. The HSC Library features 55 computer workstations, 8 computer -equipped study rooms, and 2 computer classrooms. The WVU Libraries also offer a Research Commons, a suite of ser vices that fosters interdisciplinary connections and supports graduate student and faculty research needs, with an emphasis on graduate students and early -career researchers. The Research Commons suite provides services based on library expertise and partnerships with campus connections. Computer Equipment and Services Research Computing (RC), a shared research resource at WVU, is dedicated to supporting, enabling and advancing computational research at WVU. The RC provides access to centrally managed computational systems, storage systems, high- speed networking and virtual systems. They also provide researchers with the education and training needed to use these resources. The West Virginia University School of Public Health (SPH) provides computing systems equipment and management to its five departments, including the Departments of Epidemiology, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Biostatistics, Health Policy, Management and Leadership, and Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences. The School of Public Health is a part of the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center (HSC), which houses the Department of Information Technology Services (ITS). ITS maintains the computing infrastructure for HSC and has specialists in software design and computing, computer support, systems engineering, web design, audiovisual design and production, and so on. Staff members are also designated as Computer Support Contacts, a training and support network of technical personnel with software and computer expertise and exper ience who provide first -point -of- contact technical support to many end users at Health Sciences. Information Technology Services presently maintains and supports all desktop and laptop computers allocated to faculty and staff, including research personnel, and 15 servers. All key personnel on this grant will have a Dell or comparable Desktop PC and access to all necessary current software through the SPH (including Microsoft Office suite, Endnote, SPSS, SAS, and other programs). To safeguard its computing systems, both West Virginia University and ITS invoke access restrictions, auditing systems, and policy management, as well as enterprise firewalls (the School has redundant PIX firewalls for its server infrastructure). Additionally, regular backups of al l systems are maintained, including a combination of on- site and off -site vaulting of backup media. 221 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Peripheral computing equipment located in the School of Public Health includes color LaserJet printers, high- speed, duplexing LaserJet printers, flatbed and hand- held scanners, digital cameras, a digital video recorder, and portable and ceiling -mounted computer video projection systems.

All faculty and staff in the School of Public Health, Health Sciences Center have offices that are fully equipped with furniture, local telephone service, and computer resources. They also have access to conference rooms, computer laboratory space, and additional office space designated for the research assistants within the School. A range of software is available, such as Microsoft Office, Endnote, SAS version 9.4 JMP 12, SPSS version 20, AMOS, RedH at, Symantec Ghost, WinZip, and Qualtrics. Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Photoshop/P remier Elements are available as publication and printing software. West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) The West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI) is an academic home and a catalyst for clinic al and translational research that targets priority health areas including addiction and resulting emerging epidemics (such as hepatitis C), cancer, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease. The West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute was created to find real solutions for the health problems facing the people of West Virginia. In 2012, the WVCTSI received a National Institutes of Health IDeA Clinical and Translational Research (CTR) award totaling $19.6 million from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. This grant was matched by a $33.5 million commitment from several West Virginia entities to create total funding of $53.1 million. In 2017, WVCTSI successfully secured renewed funding for an additional five years. The WVCTSI is administratively housed within the WVU Health Sciences Center and serves as the coordinating entity for all clinical and translational scientists throughout the state. WVCTSI has established crosscutting research partnerships among the WVCTSI partner institutions and collaborating Clinical and Translations Science Award (CTSA) institutions to increase research capacity to improve the health of West Virginians and Appalachians. Participating faculty and clinicians across the state are provided with research resources that include biostatistics support, clinical data resources, community networks, pre- award support, and access to a range of funding mechanisms. The WVCTSI has developed a strong infrastructure to increase the number of extramurally funded clinical and translational researchers and has grown capacity while developing new ideas and research opportunities to find real health solutions for West Virginians. WVU Health System - Hospitals and Institutes The West Virginia University Health System, the state's largest health system and largest private employer, is comprised of nine hospitals - its flagship hospital, J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital in 222 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Morgantown; Berkeley Medical Center in Martinsburg; Braxton County Memorial Hospital in Gassaway; Camden Clark Medical Center in Parkersburg; Jefferson Medical Center in Ranson; Potomac Valley Hospital in Keyser; Reynolds Memorial Hospital in Glen Dale; St. Joseph's Hospital in Buckhannon; and United Hospital Center in Bridgeport. It also provides management services to Summersville Regional Medical Center in Summersville, Wetzel County Hospital in New Martinsville, and Garrett Regional Medical Center in Oakland, Maryland. The WVU Health System also include five institutes - the WVU Cancer Institute, the WVU Critical Care and Trauma Institute, the WVU Eye Institute, the WVU Heart and Vascular Institute, and the WVU Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute. Shared Resources WVU researchers have access to a variety of cutting -edge technology, eq uipment, instrumentation and other resources. All facilities and programs are staffed with knowledgeable personnel who have expertise with using the equipment and can provide training and support. There are several shared research facilities and laboratories available at the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center, including facilities for microscope imaging, transgenic animals, flow cytometry, biospecimen processing, and genomics. The core facilities are generally operated on a charge basis with a designated individual to run the day -to-day operations. These facilities have both user and service options. In addition to the designated cores, each of the basic science departments and the interdisciplinary research centers in the WVU HSC have centraliz ed common equipment rooms dedicated to supporting the investigators' research needs, with equipment such as scintillation counters, super -speed and ultra- centrifuges with a mass Television (MDTV) Mountaineer Doctor Television (MDTV) was established in 1992 to better serve rural West Virginians through advancements in technology. MDTV is a state- wide telehealth network delivering services in clinical telepsychiatry consul tations, professional continuing education, patient/community education, distance learning, and admissions teleconferencing. MDTV staff work directly with WVU departments to assist them with their collaboration efforts across campuses and to expand and enhance community outreach and education initiatives by utilizing video conferencing technologies. The Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry, in conjunction with MDTV, currently operates 32 telepsychiatry clinics throughout the state of West Vir ginia. These clinics provide child and adolescent, adult, and addiction related psychiatric services to clients in 15 counties with extensive catchment areas past county borders. Addiction related services also include provision of much - needed care to preg nant mothers. Services have expanded to include the education of rural clinic providers and psychiatry residents. 3) Describe and provide three to five examples of faculty research activities and how faculty integrate research and scholarly activities and experience into their instruction of students. Dr. Christa Lilly , Associate Professor, Biostatics, uses de- identified data from the CARDIAC award she is a key personnel on as example datasets for her applied Biostatistics class, BIOS 603. In these classes , Dr. Lilly encourages students to replicate the analysis that have been published on that dataset as a real -life example and learning tool for the course. 223 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Dr. Sarah Knox , Professor in Epidemiology, uses her population based research in the areas of heart disease, toxicology and cancer in her instruction of students including EPID 711 (Methodological Issues in Design & Analysis of Cohort Studies), and EPID 740 (Gene X Environmental Interactions and Chronic Diseases). She uses examples of contradictory resul ts published in literature to demonstrate how method and the decision of which variables to include in the study determine the outcome. She also places emphasis on the difference between mediators and confounders. This helps students ultimately understand the context of the specific research question they are asking. Dr. Steve Davis, Associate Professor in Health Policy, Management and Leadership and Adjunct Professor in Emergency Medicine, uses his experience as a PI on his \"Examine telehealth provision of services for disabled population in Medicaid\" contract with WV DHHR to his project management course, PUBH 338 (Public Health Project Management). In this class, he provides students with many real -world examples that relate directly to this project and the principles of project management, such as using S.M.A.R.T. criteria when writing measurable project objectives. He then gives the initial objectives that were drafted in the design phase of the project that did not explicitly conform to the S.M.A.R.T. criteria due to the equally important issue of stakeholder management. Dr. Travis Knuckles, Assistant Professor in Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, conducts research primarily focused on the cardiovascular health effects on inhaled particul ate matter. He incorporates this research broadly in both an undergraduate course PUBH 241 (Biological Basis of Public Health), and a graduate course OEHS 622 (Public Health Toxicology). In the undergraduate course, the focus is on the consequences to publ ic health from high levels of air pollution and specifically, particulate matter. The students gain an appreciation of both the worldwide impact of particular matter, as well as, the laws and protections in place here in the United States. In the graduate course, the students learn the specific mechanistic consequences of particular matter exposure. Data from not only his research, but also countless studies on the negative health consequences of particulate matter inhalation exposure is reviewed with stude nts and utilized in the classroom to provide real - world examples. Dr. Christiaan Abildso , Assistant Professor in Social and Behavioral Sciences and Program Director of Research and Evaluation for the Health Research Center, uses his research in community -based, theory -driven program evaluation using the CDC's Evaluation Framework to help design his SBHS 613 (Public Health Program Evaluation) and 763 (Advanced Evaluation Public Health) courses. This work is based on strong stakeholder engagement. Students in these classes are assigned a client at the beginning of the semester, meet with that client three times, and produce an evaluation presentation and report for stakeholders that is data- and theory -driven. On two occasions, students with Dr. Abildso had peer -reviewed manuscripts published from the course activities and findings. 4) Describe and provide three to five examples of student opportunities for involvement in faculty research and scholarly activities. Two Biostatistics masters' students, (MS Biostatistics), were working with Dr. Sijin Wen, Associate Professor, Biostatistics, on the NIH grant U54 West Virginia IDeA -CTR award, which resulted in one publication in which one student was the first author, \"Environmental Pollution\" in 2019, and a second publication in which the second student is the 5th co-author, \"BMC Medical Education\" in 2019. 224 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Dr. Toni Rudisill, Research Assistant Professor in Epidemiology, is a mentor for the MS1 program, where she mentors a first year medical student on a research project. The research project is related to her current research. The MS1 program awards a stipend to the medical student for 8 weeks in the summer. Her current MS1 student is also a co- author on a manuscript from the project. Dr. Lindsay Allen , Assist ant Professor in Health Policy, Management, and Leadership, works with students both in her research and in collaboration on papers. One student is a dual MD/MPH student working with her on a paper on redefining access to care supported by start - up funds. Dr. Allen also works with an MPH student supported on a Benedum Foundation award to establish and maintain a partnership that will provide health data analytics expertise, program evaluation, and project management and technical support to WV DHHR, which has also resulted in multiple opioid- related papers. Dr. Weimin Gao , Chair and Professor, Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, does interprofessional work with a Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) PhD student in his lab. This stu dent also works with Dr. Gao on his ongoing NIH grant as well as other collaborative projects. Three students , one undergrad student, one masters' student (MPH), and a doctoral student in Social and Behavioral Sciences, have all worked with Dr. Keith Zulli g, Professor and Chair, Social and Behavioral Sciences, on the CDC -funded Mindfulness -Based Relapse Prevention Intervention award. This award has also led to interprofessional collaborations for the students with the WVU School of Nursing on a new loneliness study, which uses data from the Mindfulness award. 5) Describe the role of research and scholarly activity in decisions about faculty advancement. The process of faculty evaluation for the SPH generally follow the process outlined by the University including annual evaluation, evaluation for promotion in rank, and evaluation of tenure- track faculty for the award of tenure. Each department, division, and/or program Chairperson has responsibility for determining for each faculty member (with personal consultation) his/her instruction, research, and service assignments at the time of appointment and annually thereafter. Activities of SPH faculty are sufficiently diverse as to require several appointment tracks as well as some expansion, definition and cl arification of requirements for promotion and tenure within each of these tracks. These multiple appointment tracks within the SPH should be recognized as parallel tracks without implied or intended hierarchy: Scientist and Scientist Collaborator Tracks (both tenure earning): Scientist: 70%+ research; significant contribution research Collaborator: 70%+ research (50%+ collaborative and 20%+ independent (while independent publications are expected, funding may include a PI effort )) Scientist Educator Track (non- tenure) Professional Program Tracks (both tenure and non- tenure): Health Sciences Educator -Scientist (tenure earning): <30%+ research effort Clinical/Health Sciences Educator (non- tenure) 225 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Clinical Tracks (both non- tenure and tenure): (non -tenure): 50%+ research Tracks (non- tenure): at least 95% Research or 95% Teaching Clearly written guidelines with stated expectati ons for faculty performance, and reliable and fair Promotion and Tenure processes promote the SPH and individual department success and effective faculty development, evaluation, retention, and promotion. Specific criteria and guidelines for each track are provided in the WVU SPH Guidelines for Faculty Appointment, Promotion, and Tenure document. A ppointment to Associate and Full Professor in the Tenure and Specialty Research Tracks require independent reviews of SPH faculty productivity and performance from recognized researchers/scholars at peer -institutions who are at or above the rank for which promotion is sought. For promotion to Full Professor, both Tracks also require evidence of a national/international reputation. SPH Guidelines identify evidences of national/international reputation to include \"invitations to edit or review for national/ i nternational journals; invited service on national/international research advisory or review panels; election to office in national/international professional academic organizations; serving as a consultant to national/international agencies; and invitations to give state- of-the-art lectures at national/international meetings, to organize symposia, and/or to serve as moderator or session chair at national/international scientific meetings.\" In the annual review, both the Promotion and Tenure Committee and the department chairs use a four-item scale, (Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory), to evaluate faculty performance and productivity in the areas of education, research, and service of each faculty member, as pertinent to the letter of agreement. In cases of faculty seeking promotion and/or tenure, the SPH Promotion and Tenure Committee and Department Chairs conduct independent cumulative reviews of faculty performance and productivity in the areas of education, research, and service, relative t o the SPH guidelines as appropriate. To obtain promotion and/or tenure, the faculty must make \"significant contributions\" in their primary area(s) and \"reasonable contributions\" in others. Promotions will be based primarily on achievement since the previous promotion (or appointment). Transition to N ew Guidelines The SPH is completing the process of revising its current Promotion, Tenure and Evaluation Guidelines that were approved in May, 2012. These revisions reflect a deliberate departure from School of Medicine Guidelines for Clinical and Teaching Faculty from which the current SPH Guidelines were originally developed. Moreover, the revised guidelines are aligned carefully with expectations from CEPH, reflect the required focus on practice, and allow specific departmental input in terms of scholarly activities and evidence toward excellence in each respective criteria. SPH Administration will work with the SPH Promotion and Tenure Committee for final approval, roll out, and implementation for the 2020 evaluation review period. 226 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 6) Select at least three of the measures that are meaningful to the school and demonstrate its success in research and scholarly activities. Provide a target for each measure and data from the last three years in the format of Template E4- 1. In addition to at least three from the list in the criteria, the school may add measures that are significant t o its own mission and context. Table E4 -1: Outcome Measures for Faculty Research and Scholarly Activities Outcome Measure Target 2014 -2015 2015 -2016 2016 -2017 2017 -2018 2018 -2019 Achieving total dollar amount of grants and contracts expenditure to $4 million by 2016 $4,000,000 $3,792,929 $5,122,558 $5,668,834 $5,666,865 $5,348,650 Achieving total research dollars > $100,000 > $100,000 $436,958 $358,157 $366,913 $334,860 $270,057 Providing an ongoing clinical research design, epidemiology, and biostatistics consulting service that facilitates research collaborations and partnerships Operational clinical research design, epidemiology and biostatistics consulting service Provided 16 consultations Provided 85 consultations Provided 96 consultations Provided 134 consultations Provided 123 consultations (or 485.25 hours of consultation)* Number of articles published in peer-reviewed journals 100 111 109 101 151 Number of presentations at professional conferences/ meetings 160 134 164 182 183 *Prior to 2018- 2019, the number of hours spent on a consultation was not available. 227 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 7) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: The SPH Research Office now has a Director of Research Administration, who works with SPH faculty and others throughout the univer sity to develop a school -wide strategic plan for research. Research within the SPH is consistent with its mission, goals, and objectives. The University and the School provides an environment that is conducive to research and scholarship. The school provi des opportunities for student involvement and success in research. Weaknesses: The faculty have identified a need for a more comprehensive cadre of individuals to service faculty research needs. Plans: The SPH Research Office Director of Research Administration, will develop a school -wide strategic plan for research. This plan will identify specific additional research targets, thematic areas of emphasis for further investment and development, junior faculty mentoring plans, and associated timelines for achieving the plan's stated objectives. The SPH Office of Research hired a second grants administrator who will provide additional centralized pre- and post -award support. This person starts the first week of November. 228 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BL ANK 229 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH E5. Faculty Extramural Service The school defines expectations regarding faculty extramural service activity. Participation in internal university committees is not within the definition of this section. Service as described here refers to contribut ions of professional expertise to the community, including professional practice. It is an explicit activity undertaken for the benefit of the greater society, over and beyond what is accomplished through instruction and research. As many faculty as possi ble are actively engaged with the community through communication, collaboration, consultation, provision of technical assistance and other means of sharing the school's professional knowledge and skills. While these activities may generate revenue, the value of faculty service is not measured in financial terms. 1) Describe the school's definition and expectations regarding faculty extramural service activity. Explain how these relate/compare to university definitions and expectations. In the current Promotion and Tenure document, the school defines faculty service as: Professionally oriented community and/or extramural service includes activities in which a faculty member serves as a representative of the University in a professional capacity, such as serving as members or officers in state or national public health organizations or professional societies or other service related organizations or communities; grant and manuscript reviewers; members of test committees for professional certification; and participation in state, regional, national, and international science/public health- related conferences. Outreach activities, including educational activities, within the state on behalf of the School of Public Health should be evaluated as part of ad ministrative service. Civic club activities, hobbies, sports, or non- professional interests are not considered criteria for promotion. The University defines service as: In keeping with its tradition as a land- grant institution, the university is com mitted to the performance and recognition of service activities on the part of its faculty as essential components of its mission. Enlightened perspectives, technical competence, and professional skills are indispensable resources in coping with the compl exities of modern civilization. Service by faculty members to West Virginia is of special importance to the university mission. The evaluation of service should include assessments of the degree to which the service yields important benefits to the university, society, or the profession. Especially relevant is the extent to which the service meets the needs of clients, induces positive change, improves performance, or has significant impact on societal problems or issues. One important benefit of servic e to the university is faculty participate in the governance system. Service contributions considered for evaluation are those that are within a person's professional expertise as a faculty member, and performed with one's university affiliation identified. The definition of the nature and extent of acceptable service for purposes of promotion and tenure should be identified in the unit's evaluation guidelines. Criteria for the evaluation of service should be clearly stated in the unit guidelines. Performance evaluations should be based on a holistic assessment of evidence provided in the file. 230 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH WVU's commitment to the public good is evidenced across the institution, through its mission statement, a culture of service, and robust engagement with WVU's internal and external constituencies throughout West Virginia and beyond. The Carnegie Foundation has recognized WVU with their selective Community Engagement Classification, https://communityengagement. wvu.edu/ . In addition, WVU has received awards from several other external entities for public service, and the institution annually presents internal awards for faculty, staff, and students recognizing meritorious public service. As one of the state's largest employers, WVU and its academic medical system play a direct role in the economic success of north central West Virginia. 2) Describe available university and school support for extramural service activities. WVU Community Engagement Initiative offers an academic community engagement to events there are opportunities to apply for internal and external grants, https://service.wvu.edu/faculty - staff/community -engagement -resources -and-opportunities/community -engagement -grants . 3) Describe and provide three to five examples of faculty extramural service activities and how faculty integrate service experiences into their instruction of students. Several of our faculty engage students in providing a meaningful service learning and r esearch experience to address the myriad of public health problems affecting our State. These are incorporating into the instruction of students with these examples: Example 1 -Dr. Keith Zullig serves on the Board of the Monongalia (MON) County Health D epartment. This service role has been instrumental in the development of a formal agreement between the Mon County Health Department and the School of Public Health. Dr. Zullig also teaches our PUBH 610 class which is the introductory foundational course i n public health for all MPH students. Dr. Lee Smith, Executive Director of the M on County Health department delivers a lecture on the latest health happenings in the health department during a session which is actually convened in the health department. This is a stepping off point for Dr. Zullig's lectures to incorporate information from board meetings and other activities as part of content that relates to the practice in public health. In Fall 2019 a primary example of this integration was regular communication about the evolving role of e- cigarettes in lung disease for specific populations. Example 2 -. Dr. Elizabeth Claydon teaches the PUBH 352, (Intro to Social and Behavioral Science & Practice) undergraduate course. This course has an \"S\" designation which denotes it as part of an approved Center for Service & Learning. Students interact with community partners for 10- hours of service learning cr edit for relevant course activities. Two specific examples in this class are the completion of a required Public Health Program Analysis paper developed as part of interviews with site preceptors, as well as a Health Promotion Project paper required at the end of the course. Student examples are available to view in section E5 of the ERF. Example 3 - Dr. Mike McCawley, Associate Professor in Occupational and Environmental Health. Dr. McCawley has worked on projects with citizen groups in Charleston, WV and in the six most southern 231 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH --counties in the state on issues concerning Mountain top mining. He has also appeared before the state legislature and the US House of R epresentatives to inform lawmakers on the environmental health issues in northeastern Pennsy lvania with a citizen's group called Breathe Easy Susquehanna Count y on unconventional natural gas drilling operations, as well as in southwestern Pennsylvania with a citizen's group called the Southwest PA (SWPA) Environmental Health project. In addition to service with regional stakeholders, Dr. McCawley has worked in the West Virginia counties of Doddridge and Wetzel. Information to these community -engaged stakeholders has been through public forums, radio, press and television. Recently, the League of Women Voters of PA, Pittsburgh invited Dr. McCawley to be on a planning board for a scientific forum on environmental health issues with colleagues from Columbia University, Johns Hopkins, Berkley, Colorado and the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. McCawley in fuses lecture content from these community engaged experiences. He has also engaged one of our doctoral students, Ms. Maya Nye in providing support in these areas. Her experience is documented in methods in her dissertation proposal focused on the communit y's needs in environmental disasters. Example 4 - Dr. Danielle Davidov, Assistant Professor in Social and Behavioral Sciences teaches PUBH 621 - Public Health Prevention and Intervention (MPH) and BHS 715 - Intervention Design (PhD). In these courses, Dr. Davidov integrates information from a PCORI -funded project, West Virginia AWARE (Asking Women About Relationship Experiences), to demonstrate ( 1) the importance of community engagement, ( 2) the process of \"g round up\" community engagement, and ( 3) outcomes gleaned from these approaches. Specifically, in these courses students learn how West Virginia AWARE engaged over 100 community stakeholders and eight survivors of intimate partner violence on this community engagement project. Handouts and examples of real -world recruitment materials are utilized to delineate the delicate and purposeful process of building relationships with survivors and stakeholders, and how her team maintains these relationships over time. Furthermore, classes are informed of the contributions stakeholders have made to the project and the larger field of intimate partner violence assessment. Students then apply what they have learned to their own hypothetical intervention projects wherein they speak to who they will engage to ensure their own projects are community -driven and informed and outline the process of engagement. 4) Describe and provide three to five examples of student opportunities for involvement in faculty extramural service. A significant number of our faculty serve the community on local boards and agencies outside of the scope and purview of their regular assignment in the University. Additionally, many of our faculty conduct applied and community -based research for grants and contracts with the state and regional partners. In some cases, depending on the nature and scope of the work, and in conjunction with a faculty members' title series, this effort is evaluated as and constitutes extramural service. A few examples are p rovided below: Opportunities via West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services (WVDHHS) Drs. Adam Baus, Samantha Shawley, Lindsay Allen, Thom Bias, and Robert Duval represent a select group of faculty who participate in several funded service activities for the WVDHHS. Although the school has no formal designation for faculty's work in this area other than service, these activities are closely aligned with community -engaged and participatory work. Students are exposed to faculty's 232 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH extramural service with the Bureau of Public Health and other state institutions representing DHHR via school -wide announcements via the SPH ENEW, student list -serves, social media, announcements from the Office of Student Affairs and via communications in conspicuous locations around the building. Activities framed as service in this category are those that have direct benefit to the community through an agency, state/local board, task force, a policy change or legislative initiative. Opportunities via WVU Delta Omega Gamma Mu Chapter Dr. Keith Zullig and Dr. Elizabeth Claydon provide oversight for the WVU SPH 's Delta Omega Organization. Our Delta Omega group has broken the record for winning chapter of the year for seven consecutive years. Students are actively involved with Drs. Zullig and Claydon in a number of service activities including packing Naloxone Kits as part of needle exchange programs, food drives, clothing drives, food pantry volunteers, \"adapt a family\" through angel tree programs each holiday season, reading programs, community education programs, etc. Opportunities via SPH Formal Coursework In addition to the specific examples of how faculty integrate extramural service as a part of instruction, there are many additional opportunities that incur in the classroom situation that provide the opportunity for students to participate in service activities. Graduate and Undergraduate students have opportunities through their instructors for numerous service- related activities. Dr. Elizabeth Claydon introduced her undergraduate PUBH 205 class (Writing for Public Health Audiences) to an applied and relevant community experience with Pantry Plus More to bring recipes from a 6 th grade reading level to a 3rd grade reading level. Her graduate course, co- taught with Dr. Toni Morris SBHS 616 has a \"service designation\" and students work with a different community each semester the courses are taught. Audra Hamrick, Director of Practice Based Education and Service Learning is in an ideal position to distinguish students' community involvement in PBE's and IPE's. Her service with a few local boards and organizations allows students to be introduced to volunteer opportunities during regular structured courses. Students have volunteered with Girls on the Run, https://www.gotrncwv.org/ for several projects and activities and the West Virginia Armory as part of creating food packages for families during the holiday season. The volunteerism that occurs as a part of faculty's extramural service does not constitute nor take the place of PBE 's. 5) Select at least three of the indicators that are meaningful to the school and relate to service. Describe the school's approach and progress over the last three years for each of the chosen indicators. In addition to at least three from the list in the criteria, the school may add indicators that are significant to its own mission and context. Schools should focus data and descriptions on faculty associated with the school's public health degree programs. Percent of faculty (specify primary instruc tional or total faculty) participating in extramural service activities Number of faculty -student service collaborations Number of community -based service projects Total service funding Faculty promoted on the basis of service Faculty appointed on a profes sional practice track 233 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Public/private or cross -sector partnerships for engagement and service Service is a critical expectation for all faulty at WVU in part due to our mission as a land- grant institution and our role as the State's flagship institution. Faculty demonstrate overall contributions to research, teaching or service dependent upon their appointment \"track\" but those with Scientist Educator, Professional Programs, Clinical Tracks, and Specialty Tracks are required to make \" significant contributi ons to service.\" Performance indicators for Significant Contributions in Service are spelled out in the P& T documents provided to faculty upon their appointment to the school. Additionally, the offer letter developed by our Senior Associate Dean for Admi nistration prepared for those in the tracks, contains explicit language about expectations in service as part of the evaluation/promotion process. Examples of faculty offer letters are available to view in section E5 of the ERF. Public/private or cross -sector partnerships for engagement and service The school is also pleased that all the official \"Centers\" housed in the School of Public Health have a significant number of projects that facilitate both faculty -student service collaborations, and community -based service projects. Finally, we have a longstanding relationship with West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (WVDHHR) and through this connection in addition to faculty serving as project evaluators and grantees for special projects, sev eral the services provided by our faculty constitutes both engagement and service activity. The Office of Health Affairs was created to facilitate a continuation of activities that reflect a public/private partnership with SPH. The approach with the Office of Health Affairs is to facilitate continual engagement and service that is distinguished from grants and contracts that are primarily link to external funded research. To encourage ongoing and established academic/health department partnerships the school recently entered a formal memorandum of understanding with the Monongalia County Health Department. This move was facilitated in part by the involvement of Dr. Keith Zullig, Professor in Social and Behavioral Sciences and a member of the MON County Health Department Board. This move was initiated as part of a desire to provide students, faculty, and staff with a better infrastructure to provide community - engaged partnerships and service with an academic health department lens. Activities with the Health Department have been consistent over the last three years, and the MOU will help better distinguish research activities from community engagement with the express purpose of providing support that expressly involves populations served by the health depart ment. The Office of Health Affairs has hired a new Director, Dr. Summer DiBastiani, to help coordinate specific private/public partnerships involving the state's Medicaid office, insurers, the foster care system, among others. Percent of faculty particip ating in extramural service activities Over the last three years all faculty with a title series appointment other than clinical research are required to participate in extramural service. Faculty other than those with a research title series appointment are required to demonstrate \"significant' to \"satisfactory\" contributions in service and this information is reported in Digital Measures as part of the faculty member's productivity report. This participation constitutes 47 out of 50 faculty in 2017; 51 out of 54 faculty in 2018; and 50 out of 54 faculty in 2020. 234 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Faculty promoted based on service For the 2019- 2020 cycle the SPH promoted one faculty member based on contributions to both education and service. Dr. Travis Knuckles was evaluated by external r eviewers of the basis of these contributions which is a departure from the majority of our faculty with expectations related to teaching research and service. A copy of Dr. Knuckles' dossier file is included in section E5 of the ERF . Faculty appointed on a professional practice track (SBH total faculty) In 2017, Dr. Mike Brumage was appointed as an Assistant Dean for Public Health Practice. This appointment was specifically related to changes to 2016 CEPH Guidelines with the renewed clarification of the practice -based experience and expectations for extramural service. Dr. Brumage's commitment to the school's expectations for service leadership was hampered by changes to changes in his role as Executive Director of the Kanawha Charleston Health Department. N onetheless, the school continues to seek opportunities to appoint faculty in a practice track. In 2019, Dr. Garrett Moran was appointed in a Service Track as a Full Professor in the Department of Health, Policy, Management and Leadership (HPML). Although W est Virginia University does not have a professional practice track, Dr. Garrett Moran was appointed on the basis of service for his well -recognized service contributions in behavioral health. In making the hiring decision, it was determined that Dr. Mora n's appointment created the potential for a direct benefit to the community in matters related to the opioid crisis, infectious disease, and mental health and well -being. 6) Describe the role of service in decisions about faculty advancement. The process of faculty evaluation for the SPH generally follow the process outlined by the University including annual evaluation, evaluation for promotion in rank, and evaluation of tenure- track faculty for the award of tenure. Each department, division, and/or program Chairperson has responsibility for determining for each faculty member (with personal consultation) his/her instruction, research, and service assignments at the time of appointment and annually thereafter. Activ ities of SPH faculty are sufficiently diverse as to require several appointment tracks as well as some expansion, definition and clarification of requirements for promotion and tenure within each of these tracks. These multiple appointment tracks within the SPH should be recognized as parallel tracks without implied or intended hierarchy: Scientist and Scientist Collaborator Tracks (both tenure earning): o Scientist: 5%+ service; reasonable contribution in service o Scientist Collaborator: 5%+ service; reasonable contribution in service Scientist Educator Track (non- tenure) o Significant contribution in service Professional Program Tracks (both tenure and non- tenure): o Health Sciences Educator -Scientist (tenure earning): 10%+ service effort; reasonable contributi on in service o Clinical/Health Sciences Educator (non- tenure): significant contributions in education and service 235 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Clinical Tracks (both non- tenure and tenure): o Clinician (non- tenure): significant contribution in service o Clinical Educator (non- tenure): significant contribution in service o Clinical Scientist (non -tenure): significant contribution in service Specialty Tracks (non- tenure): at least 95% Service or 95% Research or 95% Teaching Clearly written guidelines with stated expectations for faculty perfor mance, and reliable and fair Promotion and Tenure processes promote SPH and individual department success and effective faculty development, evaluation, retention, and promotion. Specific criteria and guidelines for each track are provided in the WVU SPH G uidelines for Faculty Appointment, Promotion, and Tenure document. Appointment to Associate and Full Professor in the Tenure and Specialty Research Tracks require independent reviews of SPH faculty productivity and performance from recognized service/schol ars at peer -institutions who are at or above the rank for which promotion is sought. For promotion to Full Professor, both Tracks also require evidence of a national/international reputation. SPH Guidelines identify evidences of national/international reputation to include \"Leadership in national professional organizations, service on editorial boards or specialty boards, serving on national/international advisory committees, service on grant study sections, serving as a consultant to a national/internation al agencies, election to office in national/international professional academic organization.\" In the annual review, both the Promotion and Tenure Committee and the department chairs use a four-item scale, (Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory), to evaluate faculty performance and productivity in the areas of education, research, and service of each faculty member, as pertinent to the letter of agreement. In cases of faculty seeking promotion and/or tenure, the SPH Promotion and Tenure Committee and Department Chairs conduct independent cumulative reviews of faculty performance and productivity in the areas of education, research, and service, relative to the SPH guidelines as appropriate. To obtain promotion and/or tenure, the faculty must make \"significant contributions\" in their primary area(s) and \"reasonable contributions\" in others. Promotions will be based primarily on achievement since the previous promotion (or appointment). Transition to N ew Guidelines The SPH is completing the process of revising its current Promotion, Tenure and Evaluation Guidelines that were approved in May, 2012. These revisions reflect a deliberate departure from School of Medicine Guidelines for Clinical and Teaching Faculty from which the current SPH Guidelines were originally developed. Moreover, the revised guidelines are aligned carefully with expectations from CEPH, reflect the required focus on practice, and allow specific departmental input in terms of scholarly activities and evidence toward excellence in each respective criteria. SPH Administration will work with the SPH Promotion and Tenure Committee for final approval, roll out, and implementation for the 2020 evaluation review period. 236 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 7) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths : We have a formal expectation of service for our faculty, staff, and students which is demonstrated through promotion and tenure ev aluations, our mission, vision and values as a land grant, and as part of our social justice mission in public health. Weaknesses: None noted Plans: N/A 237 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH F1. Community Involvement in School Evaluation and Assessment The school engages constituents, including community stakeholders, alumni, employers and other relevant community partners. Stakeholders may include professionals in sectors other than health (e.g., attorneys, architects, parks and recreation personnel). Specifically, the school ensures that constituents provide regular feedback on its student outcomes, curriculum and overall planning processes, including the self -study process. 1) Describe any formal structures for constituent input ( e.g., community advisory board, alumni association, etc. ). List members and/or officers as applicable, with their credentials and professional affiliations. School of Public Health Leadership Council (SPHLC) Comprised of exceptional leaders from man y disciplines, including business, education, natural resources, government, and healthcare. Dr. Catherine Slemp, who currently serves as the State Health Officer and Commissioner of DHHR's Bureau for Public Health will assume the role of Committee Chair in academic year 2020- 21. The Leadership Council works to strengthen the School's impact by advising and assisting the Dean in developing and executing strategies related to admissions, development, and advocacy.

The School of Public Health holds biannual meetings with our Leadership Council . Meetings are held in the spring and fall of each year. When necessary, special committee meetings, ad hoc project meetings, or business sessions may be held prior to the begi nning of the regular meeting. In addition to the preceptor evaluations of the field experiences and MPH student practicums, the preceptors are also encouraged to attend the students' capstone presentations. Each semester, preceptors, alumni, and leaders hip council members are invited to attend the BSPH Capstone poster presentations and given the opportunity to evaluate the students' posters and engage the graduating BSPH students. 3) Describe how the school's external partners contribute to the ongoing operations of the school. At a minimum, this discussion should include community engagement in the following: a) Development of the vision, mission, values, goals and evaluation measures The school's current vision, mission, and values statements were created with extensive input from several external stakeholders to ensure strategic align ment between our academic programming and the need of a 21st century Public Health Workforce. (Please see the strategic compass in section F1 of the ERF .) The following list , by no means exhaustive, demonstrates the breadth in our reach for ongoing interactions: SPH Leadership Council SPH Alumni Council WV Public Health Impact Taskforce (Founding Dean Greg Hand was a member in 2015) West Virginia Department of Health and Humans Resource (DHHR) The West Virginia Bureau of Public Health WVU Cooperative Extension West Virginia State Medical Association National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health West Virginia Medical Systems Although some of the committees and entities listed above may have changed or dissolved, there is continued involvement by many former members of these groups, why may now have new roles in the state and new partners. Formal input is provided through interactions with the Leadership Council and Alumni Council. The School has formal MOU's with the Kanawha Charleston and Monongalia County Health Departments. The School work s collaboratively with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) through our Sch olar in Residence Program. 242 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Our funded centers have an affiliation with local, state, and federal partners that provide oversight for population health in all fifty -five counties in West Virginia . In 2019, the School worked collaboratively with the WVU Canc er Institute to create a joint appointment for a new hire responsible for community engagement for cancer prevention and education. Constituent members and groups highlighted above are involved in faculty meetings (those with teaching assignments), survey queries about programmatic and curricula changes, and when appropriate have participated as members of search committees. Stakeholders and alumni are encouraged to attend the Dean's All Hands meetings to provide feedback when the topics are about progres s and anticipated changes. In 2019, as part of our strategic visioning, an extensive feedback loop was created to solicit input on the development of strategic priorities and the realign ment of goals with the School's purpose. The strategic visioning pr ocess was completed within six months . Evidence for this process and ongoing communication with community partners can be found in section F1 of the ERF. b) Development of the self -study document The writing of the self -study was performed by a team with an external strategic planning expert . All of the data and narratives were informed by regular involvement of external and community partners who remain engaged at the same level even after the site visit . In fact, at the time of this writing, plans a re in place for more formal MOU's with constituent groups. The content in the self - study document represents three years of ongoing engagement with several formal practice partners and stakeholders that includes , but is not limited to, past and present mem bers of the Leadership Council, Alumni Council, Mon County Health Department and Kanawha Charleston Health Department Staff, WV Health Systems, WVDHHR staff, NIOSH, and community members. Feedback on various sections of the self -study has been gathered over the course of revising competencies for MPH curriculum, development of competencies for the BSPH, the development of the plan to create an MHA (Board of Governors approval in November 2019), the Patient Navigator Program, changes to the practice- based ex perience, and development of the formal IPE with the AHEC Scholars. An invitation to review a draft of the preliminary self -study was forwarded to several community partners and stakeholder groups. (Collective responses are located in section F1 of the ERF .) On Wednesday, December 17, 2019, we host ed our Bi -Annual Leadership Council meeting. During this meeting, we provided a formal presentation to highlight how we incorporated Council feedback in the self -study and provided other pertinent updates about the process. 243 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH c) Assessment of changing practice and research needs Through a myriad of collaborative efforts with external partners the School is regularly informed of research and practice needs. Both formal and informal feedback from alumni, practice partners, and the public health workforce have inspired the addition of programs, changes in course content, the development of student -faculty research collaborations, and practice priorities. For example, feedback from the Health Department in Charleston concerning the needs of students to be trained in health- related outcomes due to the Opioid crisis in our state, resulted in the 2017 appointment of Dr. Mike Brumage as the school's first Assistant Dean for Practice and Service. Dr. Brumage's appointment/ position description was also inspired by The Council on Linkages Between Academic and Public Health Practice (January 14, 2011) in addition to the CEPH practice requirements. A nother example of collaborative efforts with external partners would include a request from the Deputy Director of NIOSH in 2018, which resulted in the NIOSH Scholar in Residence appointment for one of our faculty in OEHS. Recently, through a long -term partnership funded by CISCO and the Silicon Valley Foundation it determined the WV Public Health workforce lacked some critical skills regarding the management of data and the utilization of common analytic and statistical software. This resulted in a collaborative effort between WVU's College of Business and Economics, and our Depart ment of Health Policy, Management and Leadership to form a Graduate Certificate in Health Data Analytics. d) Assessment of school graduates' ability to perform competencies in an employment setting For the MPH and BSPH Programs , our practicum preceptors and Practice- Based Learning Committee evaluate students ' ability to perform in an employment setting. Preceptors will evaluate the student based on the competencies that define the student's scope of work and cross -cutting skills. The final evaluation for m will include the preceptor's evaluation of target competencies, work activities, products/deliverables and overall work performance of the student. Preceptors may provide comments on the student's strengths or needs for professional development. The Practice- Based and Integrated Learning Committee will serve as the content experts in review of competency attainment and final products/deliverables. Both WVU SPH Preceptors and stakeholders who serve on our Practice Committee represent the employer b ase for the majority of our students. 4) Provide documentation ( e.g., minutes, notes, committee reports, etc.) of external contribution in at least two of the areas noted in documentation request 3. Appointment of Assistant Dean for Practice and Service Appointment of NIOSH Scholar in Residence Please see section F1 of the ERF. 244 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 5) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: WVU SPH has a longstanding and documentable history of the involvement of external partners as part of its overall mission, vision, and goals and a track record of community involvement in our programs' evaluation and assessment. Weaknesses: None noted Plans: N/A 245 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH F2. Student Involvement in Community and P rofessional Service Community and professional service opportunities, in addition to those used to satisfy Criterion D4, are available to all students. Experiences should help students to gain an understanding of the contexts in which public health work i s performed outside of an academic setting and the importance of learning and contributing to professional advancement in the field. 1) Describe how students are introduced to service, community engagement and professional development activities and how they are encouraged to participate. Community service and professional development are pillars of our programs. Beginning at new student orientation for each program, orientation leaders set the tone that engagement in each of these areas is encouraged and expected. For our BSPH students, there is a 50-hour minimum community service requirement. Those hours are logged/tracked in a system called iServe (https://iserve.wvu.edu/ ), which is maintained by the WVU Office of Service and Learning. In addition to being able t o track and log hours in iServe, the platform serves as a database for hundreds of current opportunities to engage in the community on any given date. Within the SPH , an Experiential Opportunities webpage was created (https://publichealth.hsc.wvu.edu/students/student - resources/experiential -opportunities/ ), and is maintained by, the Director of Public Health Practice & Service Learning. On Monday of each week, the WVU SPH Student ENEWS is distributed to all students via e- mail. The Student ENEWS serves as a digest of all things SPH. Included in that weekly newsletter is a section with the header \"EVENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES\". In that section, students are informed of opportunities to engage on campus and in the community. The S chool also maintains e-mail listservs for each program for more targeted communication with students. Staff from the Office of Academic and Student Affairs often visit classes to p romote upcoming events and many course instructors include slides in their class presentations to inform students of upcoming opportunities to engage. Two additional resources that help introduce the importance of community engagement and professional development for SPH students are the Student Association of Public Health (SAPH) and the Delta Omega Honorary Society. Each organization has language about service/professional development embedded in its respective constitution/by -laws. These organizat ions hold regular leadership/membership meetings to keep constituents abreast of upcoming service/professional development opportunities. They maintain their own membership listservs for additional communication and have active social media profiles for i nformation distribution. MPH students, through a required graduate seminar, are introduced though public health practice experience by attending at least one Monongalia (MON) County Board of Health meeting, which is held quarterly. The County Health Department is walking distance from the SPH and by requiring student attendance early on in their curriculum, they are introduced to policy realities of public health and, depending on the unpredictable agenda, are witness to the exchange b etween public health practitioners, board of health members, and community members on topics ranging from the routine delivery of immunization services to the often heated debate surrounding smoking ordinances. The close proximity of the county health depa rtment provides a working laboratory for the SPH. As of this writing we have secured a formal MOU with the Mon County Health Department (see section F2 of the ERF) . 246 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2) Provide examples of professional and community service opportunities in which public heal th students have participated in the last three years.

Weakness: None noted Plan s: N/A 248 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 249 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH F3. Assessment of the Community's Professional Development Needs The school periodically assesses the professional development needs of individuals currently serving public health functions in its self -defined priority community or communities. 1) Define the school's professional community or communities of interest and t he rationale for this choice. Our professional community is the public health workforce. This includes the current workforce and our graduates who are trained with skills related to the needs of West Virginia residents and other underserved and/or rural populations. Our professional community is accessed through a series of relationships with 5 primary partners: 1) The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources 2) The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 3) Local and Regional Health Departments (Monongalia County Health Department (local) Kanawha Charleston Health Department (regional) 4) The Mid -Atlantic Public Health Training Center 5) West Virginia Health Systems and WVU Medicine The rationales for these partnerships are related to the formal collaborations established to enhance seamless integration of goals, committed resources aligned to ensure long -term relationships, and practice and training needs of the public health workforce as well as the likelihood for employment oppor tunities for graduates. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services (WVDHHR) has an established office within the School of Public Health, The DHHR- WVU partnership focuses on three targeted DHHR areas of need including assistance with data analytics, program evaluation, and technical assistance/project management. Like other state -university partnerships, the DHHR -WVU partnership has a strong emphasis in supporting the state Medicaid program (Bureau for Medical Services). Additionally, the DHHR- WVU partnership includes programmatic initiatives within the DHHR Cabinet Secretary's Office, the Bureau for Behavioral Health, and the Bureau for Public Health. The reach of the activities of DHHR includes populations that are vulnerable, underserved, and burdened by socio economic status, limited resources and health inequities. The rationale for this choice as a priority partner is related to the establishment of resources dedicated to the mission of the school of public health to serve the populat ion of the state characterized primarily as Appalachian. These resources include the employment of SPH faculty and staff, training and practice opportunities for students, and revenue from grants and contracts to be utilized to further build academic progr ams. The goal of DHHR to retain employees in the state and the goal of WVU SPH to ensure employability of graduates at all three levels further support this entity as a priority population. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) shares the campus with WVU SPH. West Virginia University is the only main campus in the US that shares a \"backyard\" with CDC's NIOSH. It was designated as a professional community partner to enhance and establish our footprint in occupational safety and health, worker health, and to train NIOSH staff. In 2017, we establish a NIOSH Scholar in Residence position to facilitate seamless cooperation between our two institutions. The proximity was also a factor in the choice as a professional community partner i n addition to the number of employees who have been able to take advantage of a tuition benefit while earning a PhD from our program. 250 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH West Virginia University School of Public Health has a formal MOU with the Monongalia County Health Department that dictates activities related to professional development and training. This local health department is within a short walking distance to the School of Public Health and was instrumental in support for the establishment of the School to facilitate opportunities for employment and training for its staff. Our choice of the Kanawha Charleston Health Department as a regional partner is tied to its status as the state's only accredited health department and its position in the capital which is the epicenter for policy and legislative mandates. Students and faculty have ongoing opportunities to participate as practice partners, in the development of legislative briefs, and training relevant to appropriate units in the health department. The Mid- Atlantic Public Health Training Center (MAPHTC) was established in 2001 by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to assist in the national goal to \"improve the nation's current public health system by strengthening the technical, scientific, managerial and leadership competence of the current and future workforce.\" The MAPHTC became the MAR -PHTC in 2014. The MAR -PHTC is part of the HRSA Public Health Training Center Network and represents Region III. The Public Health Training Centers (PHTCs) develop and deliver competency -based training programs to meet public health workers' core training needs. These training programs range from basic skills in public health science to leadership and systems -thinking skills. PHTC trainings are readily available. The PHT Cs offer both in- person and online training opportunities. For the multiyear grant period of 2014- 2018 WVU was one of the five Local Performance Sites for the Mid- Atlantic Regional Public Health Training Center. The School of Public Health benefits tremendously from its position as one of f ive Health Sciences programs that includes the College of Medicine. WVU Medicine is part of the West Virginia Health Systems and has a long history of collaboration, including participation in the formation of the school . Resident and Physician training is integrated in the School through our residency programs, degree options, and teaching in the form of grand rounds and lectures. 2) Describe how the school periodically assesses the professional development needs of its priority community or communities, and provide summary results of these assessments. Describe how often assessment occurs . Historically as a Department of Community Medicine and currently as a School of Public Health we have supported our mission through collaborative and reciprocal relationships with constituency groups representing the public health workforce. Ongoing assessments occur formally or informally via meetings, focus groups, surveys and direct requests for support. Specific examples are outlined below: The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (WVDHHR) The School of Public Health has a formal relationship with the WVDHHR with Dr. Summer DeBastiani, who is housed within the School and Dr. Nathan Pauly housed in Charleston. T hese individuals direct, monitor, and provide daily oversight for contractual obligations with the WVDHHR. Through weekly, monthly, and annual meetings with staff members located in Charleston and Morgantown, the school determines the needs of the public health workforce. The needs are solicited through face- to-face contact with WVDHHR staff, surveys, focus groups, and direct requests for services and training. For the reporting period from 2017 to the present, activities as a result of a needs assessment w ith this organizational partner have resulted in 17 new contracts which include 1) a report on changes in Medicaid spending and enrollment over time, 2) a policy brief on the potential return- on-investment for 251 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH adult preventive dental coverage within Medicaid (Data Analytics area); 3) an evaluation of WV Medicaid Diabetes Health Home Program, and 4) an ongoing evaluation of Substance Use Disorder 1115 Waiver Program (Program Evaluation area). Additionally, the SPH, through health affairs, provides implementation support for the State Opioid Response grant provider education initiative, and strategic planning support for Bureau for Medical Services (Technical Assistance/Project Management area). Mid-Atlantic Public Health Training Center (MAPHTC) With new HRSA grant funding in August 2018, WVU is now listed as a Community -Based Training Partner. All WVU PHTC activities focus on work force development for community -partners (i.e., BPH, WVLHI, LHDs, etc.). Dr. Ranjita Misra, Director of the WVU PHTC, is considered a content area expert for MART -PHTC. Assessment activities are ongoing as part of the training grant deliverables. Dr. Misra submits an annual impact report for these activities. West Virginia Health Systems and WVU Medicine The Master of Health Administration was planned in response to feedback from the CEO of WVU Hospitals (Dr. Albert Wright) and WVU Health System Vice President of Strategic Initiatives (Mr. Dave McClure) WVU Medicine, and other health care administrators. The reques t was based on the need for physicians and other healthcare providers to be better trained in aspects of population health as a foundation for managing health care. The assessment took place as a function of exit interviews with residents/physicians, evaluation of best -practices, community needs surveys, and employer data. This program will be a hybrid model to accommodate the schedules of residents and other practicing health care providers. The Master of Health Administration will begin enrollment in Fall 2020. Monongalia County (local) and Kanawha Charleston (regional) Health Departments Assessment of needs are determined by direct communication with Health Department Directors (Dr. Lee Smith, Monongalia (M on) County and Dr. Sherri Young, Kanawha Charl eston and senior staff who communicate the needs of their employees and those in the public health workforce. Assessment of needs in the Mon County Health Department resulted in a Regional Epidemiologist position with a shared faculty appointment in the Department of Epidemiology. It was determined that this position could enhance the practice experience of graduate students to prepare them to be successful as part of the 21 st Century Workforce. Additionally, it was determined that the needs of the public health workforce as part of our local constituent group would be enhanced by the development of a formal MOU. The former Executive Director of the Kanawha Charleston Health department worked with WVU SPH to provide practice experiences and training for graduates focused on harm reduction, emergency and disaster preparedness, and the preparation of legislative briefs. There has also been an ongoing focus on training providers in the areas of maternal and child health, health disparities, and tobacco cessation. These activities were managed in collaboration with the West Virginia State Medical Association. Dr. Young has been in the position of Director for less than a year and com munication is ongoing regarding the needs of our regional health department. The WVU SPH Leadership Council is comprised of members from WVDHHR, West Virginia Health System and West Virginia Medicine, NIOSH, and others representing the needs of the publi c health workforce. (For a full-list list of titles and member positions see section F3 of the ERF) . The Leadership Council meets bi -annually. We assess needs of the public health workforce through face- to-face meeting activities, break -out sessions, focus groups, and direct communication with members. 252 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Leadership Council members specific discussions regarding career opportunities and retention of West Virginia graduates as part of the public health workforce led to the creation of the Public Health Caucus (see details in section F3 of the ERF) . The meeting that led to the establishment of the Public Health Caucus was held on December, 12, 2019. Dr. Cathy Slemp, Director for the Bureau of Public Health (a unit of WVDHHR) and a member of the SPH Leadership Council and Dean Jeff Coben hold weekly meetings as a function of the activities of the Public Health Caucus. The most recent assessment of needs from the Bureau of Public Health to enhance the lobbying influence of the Public Heath Caucus determined a need f or a database to address the complex burden created by Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACES). This database and the accompanying infrastructure will be utilized by the public health workforce comprised of staff from WVDHHR (article applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. The SPH enjoys a long and formal history of ongoing work and collaboration with the WVDHHR Divisions, Bureau for Public Health, Kanawha Charleston Health Department, Monongalia County Health Department, CDC NIOSH, WVU Hospital Systems, HSTA Program and others. This list is not exhaustive but captures the primary professional community that was involved in the development of the School of Public Health. There is a clear focus on train- the-trainer and service delivery for the populations with a rural designation. Our professional training programs are geared to positively influence the end user. End users are often dependent on the state for health care services and those who manage systems in response to federal or state mandates. The School has a positive track record for delivery of programs designed to serve populations with disparate health outcomes associated with substance use, addiction, and disability . Stakeholders and collaborators reflect groups highlighted throughout this document and have requested services from our faculty and professional staff for a variety of critical public health workforce education, training, and skill needs. Formally, the School has been responsive to these needs as part of service contract requests, employer requests, community needs assessments, strategic planning activities, workforce needs surveys, alumni surveys and project management requests. Strengths: Longstanding and ongoing partnerships with the workforce through many centers and programs. Weaknesses: None noted Plans: MHA program Additional certificate courses Opioid Conference in November organized by HPML Department 253 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH F4. Delivery of Professional Development Opportunities for the Workforce The school advances public health by addressing the professional development needs of the current public health workforce, broadly defined, based on assessment activities described in Criterion F3. Professional development offerings can be for -credit or not -for-credit and can be one- time or sustained offerings. 1) Describe the school's process for developing and implementing professional development activities for t he workforce and ensuring that these activities align with needs identified in Criterion F3. The needs of the workforce are aligned with our professional communities of interest. The School utilizes strategic planning opportunities for implementing and d eveloping professional activities for the workforce. In order to ensure an infrastructure to facilitate appropriate alignment between the needs of the public health workforce the School established a formal university partnership with WVDHHR. The delivery of professional development opportunities occurs through conferences, seminars, meetings, and for -credit certificate programs. Delivery of professional development is \"for -credit\" for our MS in BIOS and Health Analytics Certificate Programs. These programs are advertised on our website (the Health Analytics Certificate was recently approved by the Graduate Council). Certificate programs are/will be marketed as serving members of the public health workforce who will benefit from more training in \"big data\" or statistics to manage large state- supported data systems. Other professional development is delivered as needed or in response to an executed contract. The following activities are part of our professional delivery as a result of requests from the State- University Partnership with WVDHHR: o Data Analytics Report on changes in Medicaid spending Policy brief on return- on-investment for preventive dental coverage o Program Evaluation Evaluation of Medicaid Diabetes Health Home Program Evaluation of SUD 1115 Waiver o Technical Assistance/project management Implementation of State Opioid Response grant provider education initiative Strategic Planning support for West Virginia State Medical Association 2) Provide two to three examples of education/training activities offered by the school in the last three years in response to community -identified needs. For each activity, include the number of external participants served (i .e., individuals who are not faculty or students at the institution that houses the school). Longstanding partnership with WVDHHR and the S chools role in evaluation . Example 1: In 2017 - Public Health Training Center conducted two webinars pertaining to health department accreditation. 67 local health department representatives attended. 254 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Example 2: In 2019 - West Virginia State Medical Association - Smoking Cessation presentation. Dr. Linda Alexander delivered a presentation to physicians and other caregivers in the state entitled \"The Other Epidemic in West Virginia\" to help provider s include smoking cessation education as part of the patient -provider encounter. Approximately 300 in attendance. Please see section F4 of the ERF for documentation. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths: Through a variety of modes and mechanisms the School assesses , deliver s, and evaluates professional development needs. The School is able to respond in \"real -time\" and as part of strategic planning for our community partners. Weaknesses: We have not historically gathered data as a routine part of delivery of services. Plans: The School will develop a template to help better \"count\" the number of individuals served as part of our professional development opportunities for the workforce. 255 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH G1. Diversity and Cultural Competence Aspects of diversity may include age, country of birth, disab ility, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, language, national origin, race, historical under -representation, refugee status, religion, culture, sexual orientation, health status, community affiliation and socioeconomic status. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Cultural competence, in this criterion's context, refers to competencies for working with diverse individuals and communities in ways that are appropriate and responsive to relevant cultural factors. Requisite competencies include self -aware ness, open- minded inquiry and assessment and the ability to recognize and adapt to cultural differences, especially as these differences may vary from the school's dominant culture. Reflecting on the public health context, recognizing that cultural differences affect all aspects of health and health systems, cultural competence refers to the competencies for recognizing and adapting to cultural differences and being conscious of these differences in the school's scholarship and/or community engagement. 1) List the school's self -defined, priority under -represented populations; explain why these groups are of particular interest and importance to the school; and describe the process used to define the priority population(s). These populations must include both f aculty and students and may include staff, if appropriate. Populations may differ among these groups . Priority Underrepresented Populations representing Students, Faculty and Staff First Generation Students Appalachian Students Racial and Ethnic Minorities LGBTQ Veterans West Virginia University School of Public Health is the states only CEPH -accredited school, the first new school at WVU in 50 years, and tied to the University's status as a land- grant mission of service. Of the 13 states that make up the Appalachian Region, West Virginia is the only state where all 55 counties are classified as Appalachian. Additionally, according to the Office of Rural Health Policy, 34 of the 55 counties in West Virginia were considered rural in the 2010 census . Social determinants of health, unemployment rates, and overall health outcomes for the state, dictated our priority population focus on rural, first generation students https://carruth.wvu.edu/resources/self -help/first -generation- college- students , racial populations, and Veterans https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/west -virginia . Moreover, it is also important to note that the University has extensive systems in place to prioritize resources, support , and an infrastructure that caters to these groups. Geographic location is a primary factor in determining risk for morbidity and mortality, access to health care, and exposure to toxic environments. The School was formed in response to the well -documented needs of each of these populations and the varied ways in which culture, social status, education, limited resourc es, discrimination, bias in health care due to institutional racism and its impact on health equity and inclusion. 2) List the school's specific goals for increasing the representation and supporting the persistence (if applicable) and ongoing success of the specific populations defined in documentation request 1. 256 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Overarching Goals from WVU Strategic Plan 2020: Goal 1: Objective 1.2: Prepare students to confront the public health challenges of the 21st century Goal 1: Objective 1.3: Strengthen the public health workforce of West Virginia Goal 2: Objective 2.2: Expand our research portfolio to produce new knowledge about determinants of disease and injury, causes of health disparities, and effective interventions for prevention and treatment Goal 4: Objective 4.1: Recruit and retain a high quality and diverse workforce Goal 4 Objective 4.5: Maintain an open and inclusive governance structure that includes students, staff, and faculty Specific Diversity, Inclusion and Equity Goals Recruit and retain underrepresented minority faculty and students Create an inclusive environment for LG BTQ and/or minority students, faculty, and staff Create an infrastructure to support Zero Tolerance for Discrimination and Harassment Incorporate a social justice framework in curriculum and instruction 3) List the actions and strategies identified to advance the goals defined in documentation request 2, and describe the process used to define the actions and strategies. The process may include collection and/or analysis of sc hool-specific data; convening stakeholder discussions and documenting their results; and other appropriate tools and strategies.

This office has provided several useful resources employed by our school to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion among our faculty, staff, and students. The WVU Human Resources Progr am no longer supports a formal Social Justice Representative for department level participating in hiring and searches, however, the school has continued to provide a trained social justice representative on all our hiring and search committees. Additional ly this office conducts regular training to all with supervisory responsibility in the areas of culture, diversity and inclusion 257 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH https://talentandculture.wvu.edu/lod/supervisor -development . The Chief of Staff and Senior Associate Dean for Administration ensure that staff and faculty benefit from leader training in diversity and culture and university -wide resources found in the WVU Employee Handbook and the Faculty Handbook. The Director of Admissions, Director of Career Development and Student Success, Student Affairs Staff, Program Directors, and the Director of Assessment have access to a university -wide infrastructure that s upports all policies and procedures with diverse recruitment, retention, and student experience. These resources are in the Office of Graduate Life, the Office of Undergraduate Affairs, the Graduate Recruitment Office, and the Division of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (DEI). In addition, this year's focus on graduate recruitment is centered on diversity with specific goals to recruit more minority students. The Office of Graduate Recruitment has a memorandum of agreement with Florida A&M University to par ticipate in their Graduate Feeder Scholar's Program and representatives from WVU attend their Recruitment Fair each year in early September. WVU representatives attend SACNAS each year. This group focuses on the success of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native A mericans in attaining advanced degrees in STEM fields. Also, each year, WVU representatives that attend ABCRMS, which is the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students. All three of these recruitment events are focused on minority recrui tment. Additionally, each year, the Office of Graduate Admissions and Recruitment partners with the WVU Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to host our WVU Colloquium. This event is for under -represented minority students interested in doctoral stud y at WVU. It is a three- day event where we have guest speakers to share information on the doctoral education experience here, as well as have the attendees spend time with their individual programs of interest. Those who attend this event are considered for the Chancellor's Scholars program, which is housed in the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Lauren Devine, as our Director of Admissions, attends weekly meetings centered on the activities described above. One of our currently enrolled MPH st udents came to us via the WVU Colloquium Program. The Advising Coordinator (Leah Adkins) for the Masters and Doctoral Programs, Program Directors, Academic Dean, and faculty have consistent and regular information via targeted email messages, various onl ine news communication venues, and electronic communication stations conspicuously posted around faculty and student offices and the Office of Academic Affairs regarding diversity, inclusion and equity events. The Advising Coordinator attends regular meeti ngs with the Office of Veterans Affairs http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/veterans/#Center to both ensure compliance with educational requirements and that the program is meeting the needs of our active veteran students who have often been deployed during their schooled coursework. We also have a rich collaborative relationship with the Director, Center for Excellence in Disabilities http://w ww.cedwvu.org/ who also retains adjunct faculty status in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences. In the last three years, student interest in our program has been based on a desire to work with scholars in the area of rural and/or Appalachian health, health disparities, opioid, tobacco and other substance use, and groups typically underrepresented in and by the health care system. WVU has the nation's leading scholar in Veteran Suicide, a formal relationship with NIOSH for those who are interested in workplace injury, including those who are disparate populations, five (5) Centers with a rural health focus, each actively supporting student research since 2017, and a community -engaged and practice- based faculty. Decisions regarding our priority pop ulations have been made in response to the stated needs for the school to train the next generation of the public health workforce with the knowledge and skills that will benefit underrepresented groups. Although our student body represents populations from around the US and abroad, almost all our staff are from West Virginia. This is an indicator of the importance of having a priority focus that represents 258 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH the indigenous community and populations. There is a very strong and resilient Appalachian culture alive and well at WVU and many are proud to work for one of the state's largest employers. Many of the administrative staff hired prior to the creation of the SPH have remained apart from those who left the school to take advantage of retirement benefits. This may be indicative of the compensation and benefits that the School affords different from other employers in the state. Several faculty were part of a cluster -hire and have remained with the school over the last seven years. The University prioritized culture, climate, service and respect as part of its institutional vision and the school has likely benefitted from this in many ways that reflect an inclusive and welcoming environment. However, in the last three years we have actively recruited faculty an d staff by advertising in Diversity Job postings, including interview questions regarding experience with and responsibility for working with diverse populations, and asking a member of the DEI staff to participate during candidate interviews. 4) List the ac tions and strategies identified that create and maintain a culturally competent environment and describe the process used to develop them. The description addresses curricular requirements; assurance that students are exposed to faculty, staff, preceptors, guest lecturers and community agencies reflective of the diversity in their communities; and faculty and student scholarship and/or community engagement activities. WVU students are exposed to a variety of experiences centered on diverse populations, equity, inclusion, and social justice through the well -advertised schedule of events highlighting these topics, active encouragement to attend published events, and incen tivized participation in diversity activities through course credit or extra points. Guest lecturers are arranged through faculty's work with underrepresented groups or agencies that cater to such groups and are delivered via SKYPE for those with positions that limit travel and through organized venues such as the Dean's Colloquium Series** (For topics see section G1 of the ERF) . Students are actively involved in the WV Global Health Brigade, which sponsors a yearly mission trip abroad, work with Center Dir ectors with project topics that range from opioid use and abuse to brain injury among veterans. Students have participated in Learning Journeys, Practice- Based Experiences, Internships, and with alumni across the state to foster a keen awareness of the needs of the Appalachian region. Students have also participated in research focused on the Appalachian culture and health needs through ongoing work with faculty and exposed through coursework to the applied practice of intervention, evaluation, community ne eds assessment, and policy development for rural and underserved groups. The following list provides detailed information: Weekly advertised events tied to diversity, equity, inclusion, and cultural competence Required course content linked to culture, social justice, equity, and underrepresented populations in health care access and treatment (PUBH 620: Building and Sustaining Public Health Capacity) Standardized questions on yearly performance evaluations Expert on Appalachian Health at new student orientation 2016, 2017 Vice President of Diversion of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion delivers commencement speech to Public Health Graduates in 2018 Workshops on Implicit Bias Title IX Training Human Resource Training on Cultural Competence in the Workplace Partnerships with organizations that serve diverse constituent groups 259 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Director of Diversity and Community Engagement Speaker at mandatory new student orientation 2019 5) Provide quantitative and qualitative data that document the school's approaches, success es and/or challenges in increasing representation and supporting persistence and ongoing success of the priority population(s) defined in documentation request 1. The WVU Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion https://diversity.wvu.edu/ has an extremely well - articulated vision, outstanding resources, and is one of the most comprehensive centers of its kind housing both the Title IX Office and the Equal Opportunity Office. Due to the extensive nature of our relationship with former Vice President David Fryson, current Vice President Meesha Poore, and the newly hired Center Director, J. Spencer Darden, the school has benefitted from external resources that support our efforts to recruit, retain, and provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for our priority populations. Additionally , the community -engaged scholarship of our faculty coupled with the strategic placement of students in roles that ensure exposure to and skill development in working with priorit y populations has been successful. The School had an active Diversity Committee from 2015 to 2018. In 2017- 18, Dean Coben asked that the Diversity Committee spend time reexamining its role to better align its activities, purpose, and goal setting with the goals of the program and to develop a blueprint for sustainability and measurable goals (see corresponded in section G1 of the ERF) . Recommendations from the Diversity & Inclusion Report June 28, 2018 and actions undertaken to satisfy these recommendations are found (in section G1 of the ERF) . The delivery of the June 28, 2018 Diversity and Equity Report by Dr. Andress coincided with two significant events. Also, in June, the ASPPH's Diversity and Inclusion Section and Executive Committee Task Force on Di versity and Inclusion focused on developing policies that support zero tolerance for harassment and discrimination. Further, during a similar period, Vice President Clay Marsh launched efforts to enhance an institutional culture that better supports a diversity and inclusion infrastructure piloted through a targeted program at the Health Sciences Center. Dr. Linda Alexander was asked to lead efforts in response to the Diversity and Inclusion Report and to represent the Health Sciences Center efforts because of her nationally recognized expertise in this area and her ongoing role with ASPPH. In Fall 2018, Dr. Alexander formed a task force to investigate the contemporary responsiveness to diversity, inclusion, and equity activities. The Diversity and Inclusion Task Force was created to: Examine the recommendations from the 2018 Diversity and Inclusion Report and develop measure goals to support these recommendations where appropriate Align WVU SPH goals with those for all health professions programs in Health Sciences Evaluate all the WVU SPH systems that support learning, inclusive excellence, recruitment, retention, practice, and human resources to better understand gaps in teaching, service delivery, culture, climate, hiring practices, and scholarship. Develop a set of expectations and measurable goals around inclusive excellence and cultural competence for faculty, staff, and students. The WVU SPH Diversity and Inclusion Task Force has only rec ently begun to collect data external to what is gathered annually as a part of University -wide culture and climate survey's and measures on yearly performance evaluations. Data collection will be tied to the goals and objectives highlighted in this section and those described in more detail in the Diversity and Task Force charter document (see 260 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH section G1 in the ERF) . The following highlighted sections for Faculty, Staff and Students highlight qualitative and quantitative data that will be gathered to inform goals for diversity and cultural competence. Faculty The WVU School of Public Health continues to embrace the tenants associated with a diverse perspective as part of teaching and learning. However, prior to the creation of the Diversity & Equity Task F orce there was no formal infrastructure for examining factors associated with the retention of faculty of color, faculty representing the LGBTQ population, or those with Veteran status. In 2017 there were 47 full -time faculty, 52 full -time faculty in 2018, and 45 full -time faculty on our 2019 faculty roster. Excluded from these numbers are those faculty with 100% Research Title Series or those with secondary appointments in other Schools. During the 2017- 2019 reporting period we have transitioned from 5 Af rican American faculty to two African American faculty and one Faculty member who identified as LGBTQ who left the University in 2018. We have retained faculty who identity as Asian (N= 7). There are no current faculty that self - report as Hispanic or Nativ e American. Additionally, there are no current faculty that self -report as LGBTQ. The 2018 Diversity Report (Dr. Lauri Andress) that provides the infrastructure for the work of the WVU SPH Diversity and Inclusion Task Force highlights the need to recruit and retain diverse faculty. Based on the well -documented historical lack of representation of African American (AA) faculty in both leadership roles and in tenure tracks we have followed the lead of the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and ramped up efforts to recruit and retain faculty in this underrepresented class at Predominately White Institutions (PWI's). The Senior Associate Dean of Academic, Faculty, and Student Affairs conducted informal exit interviews with Dr. Haslyn Hunte (AA male faculty from 2013- 2018), Dr. Ashante Allar (AA female faculty from 2015- 2018) and Dr. Baqiyyah Conway (AA female faculty from 2012 -2016 ). Dr. Hunte's departure was based on medical reasons that made travel to his primary residence in a neighboring state progressively more taxing, and unmet family needs as a result of his weekly commuting. We were able to retain Dr. Hunte as an Adjunct Instructor, at his request, until he obtained a permanent research position with an NGO in 2018. Dr. Allar expressed dissatisfac tion and concern with the teaching load that was clearly articulated in her offer letter. Her wish to transition to online instruction only was not consistent with the needs of the SPH. A comprehensive overview of Chair and Dean performance reviews for Dr. Conway, revealed challenges in the areas of teaching and research. It is noteworthy that Dr. Conway consistently ranked \" excellent \" in Service. This is relevant due to published literature revealing that women faculty of color often spend disproportionate time in service activities when compared with their non- faculty of color peers. I did not have an opportunity to chat with the LGBTQ faculty member who departed the School of Public Health for a Senior Administrative Position in the WVU School of Nursing regarding his resignation. However, I did preside over his promotion and tenure process and found that he was treated equally and fairly. During the last 18 months, the SPH has participated in several activities geared toward the recruitment of African A merican faculty to reduce barriers that discourage a move to a rural setting and one that it not racially diverse. In addition to regular position postings, we have spent almost $1,000.00 to advertise faculty positions in circulars that cater to diverse audiences. Recent efforts to secure offers to two African American faculty were unsuccessful. In each case we provided tailored recruitment to include additional onsite visits and the inclusion of significant family members to accompany candidates on their visit to Morgantown, at a cost of over $3,000.00 and extraordinary planning. Post 261 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH offer interviews with the two respective candidates who elected not to come to WVU SPH yielded personal reasons in one case, and non- urban location as the other reason. The D iversity Task Force will continue to look for opportunities to recruit racial and ethnic minority faculty and utilize resources from both ASPPH and our own Division of Diversion, Equity, Inclusion that provide information and training on positive practices that yield successful recruitment of diverse faculty. Beginning with the Spring 2020 semester the Provost's Office announced a University -wide effort to interview and gather data from current African American faculty. The Senior Leadership of the school in collaboration with the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force will await the qualitative feedback from these interviews to inform both recruitment and retention activities to attract and retain faculty of color and others who identify as representing diver se individuals. However, there are some inconsistencies with policies. Recently, the University announced the availability of funds to recruit and retain faculty of color, but this program is currently unavailable to the Health Sciences Center. (Please see the Provost's memo in section G1 of the ERF.) We will continue to explore ways to benefit from formal programs and policies that will enhance diverse recruitment that can be applied University -wide. The Diversity & Inclusion Task Force members have attended four (4) trainings between 2018 and 2019 focused on Implicit Bias, Microaggressions, Discrimination, and Harassment. Content from this training and others hosted by the HSC -level Diversity and Inclusion Committee will provide the basis for the development of formal policies and procedures to recruit and retain faculty that represent racial and ethnic minorities and those who identify as LGBTQ. Although we have identified targeted recruitment of members of a protected class our school values diversity and continuously seeks to provide students with a faculty complement that can provide a breadth of experience to bear in an academic setting. Staff Our priority populations include a focus on those from Appalachia, those who identify as First Generation, and those with Veteran status. All members of our current administrative and professional staff (those with full -time benefits eligible positions and excludes student workers) are from Appalachia and/or identify as First Gen (N=34). Given the employment and socioeconomic demographics for the population of West Virginia, whenever appropriate, the educational requirements for staff positions allow for \"y ears of experience\" to substitute for educational background. This has been a deliberate move to ensure the likelihood of a diverse staff who together bring a rural perspective and contribute to our understanding of Appalachian culture. For the reporting period of 2017 to 2019 the SPH had 2 staff members who identified as African American (female), and 1 staff member who identifies as a member of the LGBTQ population. The University currently does not request sexual orientation as part of the demographic information on position applications. Of two AA staff members, one staff retired, one staff member left SPH for the School of Business for a higher salary. All position announcements are reviewed by the Chief of Staff, Senior Leadership, and the Diversity Task Force to ensure that language reflects a welcoming environment. The results from the last three years are encouraging in areas that are relevant to climate and culture. (Please see Culture Survey in section G1 of the ERF.) Acting as Chief of Staff, Ms. Shonnette Kingston and the Senior Associate Dean for Administration, Dr. Sarah Woodrum have attended 2 workshops that were specific to those in supervisory roles working with and providing performance evaluations of diverse staff. Information from thes e workshops will be used to conduct \"in- house\" trainings, workshops and \" lunch and learn sessions \" that 262 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH will both directly (staff) and indirectly (supervisors) enhance the culture and climate for staff. The Office of Talent and Culture provides resources f or staff and those who are in supervisory roles on their website. Details for those resources can be found in the Employee Handbook https://talentandculture.wvu.edu/lod/supervisor -development . In Fall 2019, the WVU SPH Diversity and Inclusion Task Force utilized information from the 2018 Diversity and Committee Report, contemporary literature on culture and climate, and information from our school -wide assessment Score Cards to det ermine that while there were several focused cultural competence and diversity efforts for faculty and students, little existed for staff. The Task Force attempted to rectify this omission by creating an opportunity for staff to benefit from a shared cultural experience. The Task Force created the WVU Read Between the Lines program and announced the activity via our Website: The School of Public Health Diversity and Inclusion Task Force invites you to participate in its inaugural common read program The W est Virginia University School of Public Health's Diversity and Inclusion Task Force (DITF) invites you to be a part of the school's first common reading experience. School of Public Health faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends are encouraged to sign- up to read one of the three books listed below. These selections were intentionally identified to represent diversity in thought and experiences relevant to West Vi rginia and beyond. A limited supply of books will be provided on a first come, first served basis at no cost to participants. You may pick up a book of your choice starting Wednesday, Jan. 15, through Monday, Feb. 3, while supplies last. A sign- up form wi ll be available upon pick -up; you'll simply need to provide your name, date of pick -up and the title of your book selection. In March, the DITF will host a brown bag series - led by \"book champions\" - devoted to the discussion of each book. For a quick hands -on review of the book selections, visit Ms. Katharine Belcher in the Dean's Office Suite in room 2267. You can also find details about the books and their respective authors online via the links below. The three book options for Spring 2020 are: Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance The Hate You Give by Angie Thomas Educated by Tara Westover This activity was designed as a common read ex perience for faculty, students, staff, alumni and external partners. However, it is noted in this section that WVU SPH staff had little to no activities related to diversity and inclusion to benefit this priority population for our School. We are looking forward to setting up a series of lunch time meetings to facilitate dialogue and shared experiences based on readings on race relations in the US and Appalachian culture. 263 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Students Demographic information for students at WVU is limited to race and gender. T he institution does not collect information on sexual orientation, gender identity, first generation status, or county. Our priority populations include a focus on rural populations, however, all counties in this state are considered rural. Diversity effor ts are focused on specific populations from 10 economically deprived areas in the state of West Virginia. The following table provides information on residency, immigration status, race, ethnicity, as well as county data: Table G1 -5.a: Student Enrollment by Race and Ethnicity American Indian/Alaskan Native Asian Black African American Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander White Hispanic 2017-18 9 (3%) 18 20 (7%) Table G1 -5.b: Student Enrollment by Residency and Gender WV Resident Non-Immigrant Females 2017 -18 141 (49%) -19 (48%) 20 (7%) 221 (78%) Table G1 -5.c: Student 10 Socio -Economic Counties in WV* 2017 -18 2018 -19 2019 -20 McDowell 0 0 0 Mingo 0 0 0 Clay 1 1 3 Calhoun 0 0 0 Logan 1 2 2 Wyoming 1 0 0 Webster 0 1 0 Roane 0 0 0 Summers 0 1 1 Boone 0 0 0 *https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/west -virginia/2019/rankings/factors/4 Diversity and Cultural Competence efforts are geared toward the recruitment and retention of rural residents of the state from counties with longstanding poverty, lack of access, and limited resources. Students from this area are almost exclusively First Generation. Low numbers for the school's priority groups refl ect a need for more targeted recruitment in West Virginia and from surrounding states. However, due to the lack of clear data from Institutional Research, low numbers could also be an artifact of limited opportunities to capture demographic information rel evant to our populations of greatest interest. 264 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 6) Provide student and faculty (and staff, if applicable) perceptions of the school's climate regarding diversity and cultural competence. Since 2016, West Virginia University has implemented a climate survey to all faculty and staff. In the 2018 survey, the SPH had a 52 % response rate. On average, the SPH ratings were higher than the overall University. Most notably in the areas of consci ousness of student services, respect for delivery, and a sense of pr ide. Please see an image of the results in section G1 of the ERF. 7) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Strengths : Include the University -wide and ongoing historical and contemporary significance of the value of diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice (see Darden PPT in section G1 of the ERF) . The WVU SPH Diversity Task Force is poised to action real -time soluti ons to undesirable outcomes in this area and design a blueprint for change. This blueprint is intended to supplant efforts to have diversity and inclusion become something \"one- off\" from the regular, day -to-day, and systematic function of a School of Publi c Health. Weaknesses: Like many of our peer institutions we are anticipating traction with a more \"universal\" culture and climate survey that aligns with strategic priorities for diversity and inclusion. This effort is being led by the ASPPH Diversity and Inclusion Section (chair, Dr. Linda A. Alexander), the Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee (chair, Dr. Diane Marie Saint George), and the Zer o Tolerance Task Force Executive Committee (chair, Dr. Perry Halkitis). Plans include the opportunity to work with Institutional Research to add specific questions to routine information collected university wide. Additionally, the Task Force will work wi th the newly created LGBTQ Center and the Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to better understand the number of students who self -report as being a member of this protected class, recruitment and retention challenges with LGBTQ students, and the campus culture and climate as an environment that supports good mental health and well -being for this group. 265 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH H1. Academic Advising The school provides an accessible and supportive academic advising system for students. Each student has access, from the time of enrollment, to advisors who are actively engaged and knowledgeable about the school's curricula and about specific courses and programs of study. Qualified faculty and/or staff serve as advisors in monitoring student progress and identifying and supporting those who may experience difficulty in progressing through courses or completing other degree requirements. Orientation, including written guidance, is provided to all entering students. 1) Describe the school's academic advising services. If servic es differ by degree and/or concentration, a description should be provided for each public health degree offering. UNDERGRADUATE West Virginia University has common requirements for advising of all undergraduate students across the University. These include plans of study, required advising every fall and spring semester with holds on registration for all students (new freshmen, University students, external transfers, and second degree) until students have met with their advisor to discuss course registration for the upcoming semesters. Academic Advising is a core value of the School of Public Health at West Virginia University. Students are required to meet with their assigned advisor at least once each semester. Advising services include both fall and spring semester advising for all Public Health majors, including those with dual degrees and other specific needs, including students with veteran's benefits, scholarships, honors students, student athletes, and students in academic or financial distress. Students have complete access to the advisor throughout the year, are encouraged to stop by during business hours or set up arranged appointments, and can contact the advisor through email 7 days a week. New freshmen have a proposed Plan of Study developed during their first semester in the program; they register for a set of recommended courses their first semester. Transfer (internal and external) students work with the advisor to develop a Plan of Study upon acceptance into the program and prior to registering for any courses. All Plans of Study are updated at semester advising appointments, and students are provided with a cop y. In addition, DegreeWorks lists all program requirements and documents the completion of these as students progress through the program. The advisor completes 90- hour degree checks for students when they reach their senior year. Advisors also performs the review of graduation applications and is the primary contact for reviews ensuring all degree requirements have been met. Throughout the academic year the advisor provides assistance at the academic session of WVU's Welcome Week, completes financial aid audits, attends academic advising council meetings and workshops, completes student -athlete audits, posts electronic special permission in the Banner system, assists with graduation ceremonies in the spring term, provides academic advice during new student orientation in the month of June and teaches Public Health 191 a freshman year seminar course in the fall. Graduate (MPH/MS) The MPH and MS Academic Program Advisor , Ms. Leah Adkins , in collaboration with the Program Director, Dr. Erik Carlton, provid es support, knowledge and guidance throughout the student's academic program. The Program Advisor helps with the development of individualized Plans of Study through WVU DegreeWorks, helps to address student problems or concerns related to the plan of 266 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH study, answers questions about related courses and electives, and serves as a liaison with the student - identified faculty mentor. MPH and MS students are required to meet with the Program Advisor to complete the individualized Plan of Study during their fir st semester and to identify their choice of faculty mentorship. The Plan of Study serves as a formal agreement between the student, School of Public Health and the HSC Office of Graduate Programs and consists of the conditions the student must meet in order to earn the desired degree. This plan is approved by the student, Program Advisor, MPH or MS Director, SPH Sr. Associate Dean, Academic Affairs, and the Assistant VP HSC Office of Graduate Programs. MPH and MS students are required to meet with the Prog ram Advisor each semester to review progress prior to enrollment for the next semester courses and to complete an annual student evaluation. The MPH and MS Program Advisor will guide each student through the process of applying for graduation and confirm the student's eligibility for the MPH or MS degree. Graduate (PhD) The PhD departmental advisors are the main point of contact for PhD students in their first and second year. The primary responsibility of the departmental advisors is to help students select courses appropriate for their chosen degree and to provide early mentorship until a research mentor (dissertation committee chair) is chosen. In the first semester, departmental advisors and students meet to complete the major -specific Plan of Study Worksheet, outlining the courses to be taken for the degree. This Plan of Study Worksheet will serve as the foundation for the actual Plan of Study that is due upon dissertation committee formation and approval. PhD students are recommended to meet with their departmental advisor each semester to ensure progress towards degree completion 2) Explain how advisors are selected and oriented to their roles and responsibilities. Undergraduate In 2018, t he School of Public Health advertised for the position of Developmental Advisor and once selected by the Search Committee, Scott Mahaney was hired as the SPH Developmental Advising Specialist to advise all undergraduate students. This choice was made due to his decades -long experience in advising at other institutions and his knowledge of the software and processes implemented for advising. Scott completed WVU Employee Orientation and then was trained by the Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Studies . Currently, Ms. Sarah Opatz is the School's Developmental Advisor . Ms. Opatz received one-on-one Degreeworks and Navigate training and shadowed the Developmental Advisor in the School of Nursing. S he continues to work closely with the current Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Studies on all advising issues and processes . The WVU Advising Council , https://academicadvising.wvu.edu/ , sponsors four development sessions or workshops per semester to enhance the skills of academic advisors. Training is also provided by other University officials on software systems and updates that advisors implement as part of the advising process. Thes e include: Banner, STAR Banner, Degreeworks, Schedule Builder, Navigate, Argos and Banner Workflow. Graduate (MPH/MS) The SPH Senior Program Coordinator has absorbed the role of MPH and MS Program Advisor. This position within the SPH is/has been respons ible for course scheduling (UG, GR), maintaining student records, counseling students on requirements and academic policies and procedures, providing plan 267 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH of study and DegreeWorks course audits, as well as graduation certifications. The Sr. Program Coordi nator/Advisor within the SPH was already oriented to the roles and responsibilities for advising and continues to work with each SPH Program Director (MPH, MS and PhD) in the development of student handbooks and associated curriculum. The WVU Office of the President, and the Associate Provost for Graduate Academic Affairs, Office of Graduate Education and Life, provide monthly and yearly advising workshops for all graduate program advisors and directors to educate and update on best-practice advising methods. Graduate (PhD) PhD Advisors are assigned in each department by the Faculty Chair. The Faculty Chairs from the Department of Occupational and Environmental Health and the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences have elected themselves as the departmental advisor. The Faculty Chair from the Department of Epidemiology has elected a senior faculty member as their departmental advisor. Advisor s from each of these department s are oriented to their curriculum per regularly scheduled departmental meet ings. Roles and responsibilities of the advisors are discussed each year with the PhD Director, and advisors are provided the SPH PhD Student Handbook that highlights program and major requirements, academic and administrative polices, student resources, and the various PhD forms needed. 3) Provide a sample of advising materials and resources, such as student handbooks and plans of study t hat provide additional guidance to students. Please see H1.3 in the electronic resource file to view advising materials and resources. 4) Provide data reflecting the level of student satisfaction with academic advising during each of the last three years. Include survey response rates, if applicable. Undergraduate Please see H1.4 in the electronic resource file for evaluation results. Graduate (MPH/MS/PhD) The SPH graduate students (MPH, MS, PhD) have participated in the WVU Health Sciences Center Graduate Student Satisfaction Survey since 2016. As a source outside of the School of Public Health, the intent was twofold: (1) students would feel part of the larger health sciences community at West Virginia University and (2) they would feel a sense of anonymity by reporting within the larger cohort of students. This method yielded low response rates, with 58% in 2018 and 73% in 2019. As part of the plan to i ncrease response rates across the School of Public Health (including undergraduate students) , during the 2019- 2020 academic year an initial student satisfaction survey was released in early spring of 2020 to elicit feedback regarding recent interactions wi th student support services. 79 students elected to participate in the survey. Moving forward, student services staff will be sending satisfaction surveys to students after each scheduled appointment they complete with students. Please see H1.4 (graduate) in the electronic resource file for evaluation results. 268 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 5) Describe the orientation processes. If these differ by degree and/or concentration, provide a brief overview of each. Undergraduate West Virginia University conducts three different types of New Student Orientation (https://orientation.wvu.edu/ ) for new students and their families: During the month of June and a make- up day in August for all First -time freshmen, During the month of August for all new international students, and During the month of August for all new external transfer students. All New Student Orientations are coordinated and implemented by the WVU Office of Undergraduate Admissions (https://admissions.wvu.edu/ ). After being welcomed to the University by President Dr. E. Gordon Gee, students and their parents are exposed to information about WVU, being a college student, and WVU resources. Students and parents attend an Academic Session wit h the School of Public Health team in the morning to learn about the Public Health degree program and its requirements. After lunch parents meet with the WVU Dean of Students and the students return to the SPH team for advising and scheduling their first semester of classes. During this advising session, the start of a Plan of Study is developed and students complete their registration using Schedule Builder. The new student orientation agenda can be viewed in section H1.5 of the ERF. The Public Health Information Session covers (see PowerPoint in Document file): Accreditation Degree programs offered by the School of Public Health Program requirements for the undergraduate degree. GPA policy AP credits General education foundation requirements Academic expectations The 3 concentrations or areas of emphasis Minors, and electives. The capstone course and poster presentation Advising tools SPH career services SPH school activities. We also meet with all new students in the major (FTF, exter nal transfers) during the Academic Session convened during Welcome Week (https://welcomeweek.wvu.edu/ ), the day before classes start. The Dean and Senior Associate Dean for Student and Academic Affairs welcome the students, critical program and WVU information is reviewed, and we conduct getting to know you and team building exercises. Graduate (MPH, MS, PhD) An important component of student advising occurs during f all orientation. All graduate students (MPH, MS, PhD) are oriented to the SPH Mission, Vision and Values from the SPH Dean and the Sr. Associate Dean for Academic , Faculty and Student Affairs. Students are introduced to the SPH Office of Students Services' Team and provided with student handbooks that outline the respective program curriculum and advising process . Also reviewed are WVU/SPH relevant policies and procedures, as 269 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH well as WVU/SPH student resources. Students are also introduced to various WVU entities that participate as scheduled: WVU Academic Integrity, Office of Student Conduct; WVU Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; WELLWVU; and WVU Financial Aid Office, to name a few. Faculty mentors play an important role in sharing their career experience and knowledge, providing student encouragement, are sources of information and opportunities, in addition to serving as academic role models. Students are provided a packet of information that includes a list of SPH Faculty with their resear ch interests. The MPH/MS student will identify a faculty mentor(s) from this list during their first advising session to help guide and direct the student throughout their program. The PhD student will identify their faculty mentor after year 2 of their P hD program and completion of coursework required. Information on WVU/HSC campus resources and Morgantown/Monongalia County resources are also included in the packet for students. 6) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Undergraduate Strengths : All new students are oriented to the University, the School of Public Health, and the Public Health major. Advising is a core value: students are advised and their Plan of Study updated every semester. Students have access to the Academic Advisor, thei r instructors and the Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Weaknesses: None This criterion is fully met. Graduate (MPH/MS) Strengths : The SPH MPH and MS Academic Advising services have strengthened due to the multiple levels of student advisement and mentoring. A central MPH/MS Academic Program Advisor has allowed for consistency and continuity within each program and the WVU/SPH processes are more aligned to follow. A central MPH/MS advisor has allowed the SPH faculty to serve more in mentorships roles that provide students the opportunity to learn first -hand from faculty experience and who can serve as employers to graduate student \"apprentices\". Consistent academic program advising, appropriate faculty mentorship, in addition to career counseling, will serve as influential factors with degree completion. Weakness: None This criterion is fully met. Graduate (PhD) Strengths : The advising experience by PhD students in the SPH has been under review and approval by the latest PhD Program Director. We have taken the following t hree steps to improve our program : 1. The Program Director regularly meets the students for an external overall mentoring and to facilitate a collaborative feel in the group of PhD students. The Director meets with each student individually once per year at minimum, and twice per year for first year PhD students. These meetings are meant to generate a sense of senior support to the students as well as to 270 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH work on more specific components such as the Individual Development Plan (IDP). Each semester the PhD Director also runs lunch meetings (luncheons) exclusive to PhD students that have been well attended. 2. The Departmental level advisor positions explained above have been formalized to a greater extent than before which has resulted in significant improvement in student advising experiences. Students are instructed to consult with the departmental advisors about Plans of Study, course selection, potential course waivers, and any other issues they m ay have, which has given them a direct link to their department. The PhD Program Director actively communicates wi th the advisors and serves to support them in their roles. 3. The revised PhD Program, discussed in section D18 will include an ad- hoc and school -wide advising committee. This committee will primarily serve to oversee the advising experience for all PhD students in the SPH, and support decisions regarding course waivers, the matching of individual students with dissertation advisors, and confront specific case issues. Weakness: None This Criterion is fully met. 271 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH H2. Career Advising The school provides accessible and supportive career advising services for students. Each student, including those who may be currently employed, has access to qualified faculty and/or staff who are actively engaged, knowledgeable about the workforce and s ensitive to his or her professional development needs and can provide appropriate career placement advice. Career advising services may take a variety of forms, including but not limited to individualized consultations, resume workshops, mock interviews, career fairs, professional panels, networking events, employer presentations and online job databases. The school provides such resources for both currently enrolled students and alumni. The school may accomplish this through a variety of formal or informal mechanisms including connecting graduates with professional associations, making faculty and other alumni available for networking and advice, etc. 1) Describe the school's career advising and services. If services differ by degree and/or concentrati on, a brief description should be provided for each. Include an explanation of efforts to tailor services to meet students' specific needs. In spring 2017, the School created a new Director of Career Development & Student Success position. The position w as filled in late June 2017. The new director was tasked with creating career development content for students across each of the School 's programs and the services were to be accessible by all WVU SPH students and alumni. Current general services available to all students and alumni include: one- on-one coaching, mock interviews, resume development/review, cover letter development/review, business card creation, and job search strategies. The director also created and maintains a public health specific c areer section on the School's website, http://publichealth.wvu.edu/students/student -resources/career -development/ (image below). 272 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Under that site are two main hubs for students and alumni. The first area is Career Preparation, http://publichealth.wvu.edu/students/student -resources/career -development/career -preparation/ (image below). On this webpage students can find fourteen files that focus on four key areas of career preparations (Preparing Your Job Application, Preparing for an Interview, Evaluating a Job Offer, and Networking/Career Fairs). The second area is the Public Health Job Board, http://publichealth.wvu.edu/students/student - resources/career -development/jobs/ (image below). The job board is open access and is filled with local, regional, state, and national jobs within public health. Alumni, community partners, and faculty are asked to share opportunities they receive with the Director of Career Development for broader distribution to the WV U SPH student/alumni network. To date, over 300 positions have been posted on the job board. (image below) 273 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Beginning with the fall 2017 entering class, all MPH students are required to meet with Director of Career Development & Student Success i n their first semester as part of their PUBH 610 course. During that initial one- hour meeting, the director discusses the student's background and interests to begin a conversation about where they may want to go post -graduation. Students also learn abou t the career services available to them and are encouraged to continue meeting with the director on a regular basis. In fall 2018, the Director of Career Development & Student Success became the instructor of record for the undergraduate program's PUBH 200 (Introduction to Public Health Careers & Information) class. Th is one credit course is required for all BSPH majors, and is offered each semester. The class meets once a week for fifty minutes during the entire semester (16 weeks). It familiarizes students with professional development and the practice of public health, introducing them to the various settings in which public health professional's work. This is accomplished through the use of alumni panels, guest lectures, experiential learning acti vities, the creation of a LinkedIn profile, and the completion of an informational interview with a public health practitioner. All WVU students and alumni also have access to campus -level career services through the WVU Career Services Center , https://careerservices.wvu.edu/ . The campus career center has a staff of 16 who specialize in a wide range of career and professional development services including self - assessments, one- on-one career counseling, and other specialized programs and events. They host several large career fairs during the academic year and maintain an up-to-date list of workshops on their portal each semester. They also maintain a general job board for all students that is hosted via their MountaineerTRAK portal. 2) Explain how individuals providing career advising are selected and oriented to their roles and responsibilities. The School's Director of Career Development & Student Success had three years of career development/coaching experience at another CEPH accredited School of Public Health prior to his arrival at WVU. In his previous role, he was tasked with building out a career development program for public health students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. His orientation to WVU SPH included meetings with returning students, administrators within the school (academic deans and program directors), the WVU Campus Career Center, and key alumni/stakeholders within the WVU SPH network. Outside the School, WVU SPH provides opportunities for the director to attend the annual APHA Conference and ASPPH Annual Meeting to participate in the Career Services Forum that is compris ed of other career services leaders from schools and programs of public health. 3) Provide three examples from the last three years of career advising services provided to students and one example of career advising provided to an alumnus/a. For each categor y, indicate the number of individuals participating. Example 1: LEARNING JOURNEY TO SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA In October 2018, the Director of Career Development & Student Success partnered with the Assistant Dean of Practice and Service for the inaugural SP H Learning Journey. The focus of the series is to expose SPH students to public health (and public health practitioners) at work in various communities around the state of West Virginia. For the first trip, a group made up of 3 SPH staff, 3 SPH faculty, and 16 SPH students made the trip to Southern West Virginia. 274 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH The first stop on the tour was the Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine in Beckley, WV. There students visited the West Virginia Coal Mining Museum and were taken on an underground tour of a former work ing mine to explore the conditions and occupational hazards that still exist for many workers in Appalachia today. The tour was led by a retired miner. The second stop on the trip was the WV Air National Guard Armory in Glen Jean, WV. Students receiv ed an in depth briefing about the role members of the Air National Guard play in one of the largest annual events in the state, Bridge Day. Each year, on the third Saturday in October, officials in Fayette County, WV close the New River Gorge Bridge (the largest arch bridge in the western hemisphere) to vehicle traffic and open it up exclusively to pedestrians. They host a large festival, have lots of food trucks, vendors, and musicians. Thousands of visitors flock to Bridge Day each year. The folks at the ANG spoke to us about their work in threat preparedness and emergency response for Bridge Day along with other small and large scale events in the region and state. Students were then introduced to the Director of the Fayette County Health Department who provided an overview of the services they provide for their county, their staff makeup, areas of need, and their role in collaborating with a number of stakeholders, including the ANG, for Bridge Day. Next, students were bused to Burnwood National Park , on site at the New River Gorge Bridge, to get a look at the mobile command center that was established by the Fayette County Emergency Director for Bridge Day. Students were broken up into small groups for tours of the Department of Homeland Security's Command Center. The final stop of the learning journey was the Hawk's Nest Memorial and Worker Gravesite in Mount Lookout, WV. Here, students heard about the history of Hawk's Nest and the occupational hazards associated with the construction of the Uni on Carbide Tunnel. This was the site of one of the worst industrial tragedies in U.S. history. Example 2: MEET THE WVU OFFICE OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH (OHSR) In October 2018, the Director of Career Development & Student Success collaborated with the directors of the SPH's four internal research centers to launch the Meet the SPH Research Centers Series. The center directors were approached about hosting individual sessions for their centers to showcase the work they do, their primary research foci, and the makeup of their teams for students. On Monday, October 8, 2018, the series kicked off with the Office of Health Services Research. Dr. Adam Baus, Center Director, and his full -time team of five spoke to a group of 15 SPH students. The session s tarted with a welcome from the center director. The core team members were then introduced. Each team member was asked to speak briefly about their role(s) within the center and provide information about their educational backgrounds and career trajector ies. There was then a fifteen minute discussion about several of the large research projects currently housed within the center. This led to a ten minute discussion about opportunities for students to engage/connect with the center on the work being done. Finally, the session concluded with a question and answer session with the students in attendance. Example 3: NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (NIOSH) TOURS On Wednesday, April 4, 2018, a group of seven students, and the Direc tor of Career Development and Student Success, were invited to the CDC -NIOSH branch campus in Morgantown for tours of several working laboratories. Per the request of the team at NIOSH, the group was limited to a small number of students to make it easier to navigate some of the smaller labs. During each individual 275 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH visit, the Director of Career Development & Student Success asked each presenter from the lab to provide a brief introduction of their educational background and provide a few quick tips for what a student might want to study/get experience with if they wanted to obtain a similar position in the future. After checking in, students started the tours in the Motor Vehicle Safety Lab with Mr. Richard Current. Students were able to get behind the wheel of a simulator that was being used to study the threat of large vehicle roll overs (semi -trucks, fire trucks, and other large vehicles driven by first responders). After rolling over a virtual fire truck, students got to hear about the technology being created to assist in the prevention of such incidents. The second tour was with the team at the Anthropometry Lab. Mr. Rich Whisler spoke about the 3D body imaging technology they have on site and the study being conducted to update federal regulati ons for safety harnesses being worn by construction workers. Students learned that those federal guidelines haven't been updated in over 40 years and that many of the safety harnesses used today were designed to work for workers who fit the same body types of the 1- 2 models who were used in the design process. For that reason, many occupational hazards, including death, can occur with the very equipment that is intended to save lives. The third tour was at the Flu lab with Dr. Bill Lindsley. Dr. Lindsley showed students the work being done to study first responders (EMS/Ambulance Drives) exposure to air borne diseases during patient transport. Students got to see the equipment used to collect samples from fellow students who present with flu like symptom s at the campus clinic. The final tour was of the NIOSH Coal Van/Mobile Clinic. The tour was led by Dr. Cara Halldin (WVU SPH Alumna). Dr. Halldin provided an overview of the NIOSH Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program which studies the causes and effects of respiratory dis eases related to coal mine dust exposure and provides information and free vital health screenings to coal miners throughout Appalachia. Example 4: WVU SPH ALUMNI VIRTUAL MEET & GREET On Thursday November 14, 2019. The Director of Career Development and Student Success hosted the inaugural Alumni Virtual Meet & Greet via the Skype platform. A broadcast e- mail invitation was distributed to all SPH alumni, via the WVU Alumni Association Master listserv on October 25 and interested alumni were asked to RSVP for the event to receive the link for the one hour meeting. The meeting was designed and marketed with four purposes: introduce the Director of Career Development and Student Success to alumni who graduated prior to his arrival and remind alumni that career services are available to them, regardless of their graduation date provide a platform for attendees to network/connect with other graduates provide updates on current/future career service offerings for students to identify areas for engaging alumni with current students seek feedback from alumni about how they can best be served by the School in the professional development/career services areas The initial meeting was attended by four alumni (3 MPH, 1 BSPH). The alumni in attendance expressed gratitude for the creation of the event and engaged in dialogue for one hour and twenty minutes, going beyond the originally allocated time by twenty minutes. All attendees provided an in depth overview of their current positions, challenges faced in their current roles, and provided helpful 276 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH advice for other attendees. A few topics that were discussed among the group included: tips for navigating federal application systems (USAJOBS), skills that hiring managers are looking for in their organizations, and statistical software( s) that help candidates standout in their fields. Attendees indicated they would love to see the series become a recurring lunchtime meeting with the intention of heari ng what other alumni are doing after graduation. Plans for the frequency of future meetings will be discussed with the Alumni Leadership Council. 4) Provide data reflecting the level of student satisfaction with career advising during each of the last three years. Include survey response rates, if applicable. In spring 2016 (January), 44 graduate students from SPH programs (MPH, MS, PhD) completed a student satisfaction survey that was centrally administered by the H SC. Students were asked to rate the quality of their professional/career development opportunities on a 5 point Likert scale (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, or Excellent). 38 students provided a response to the question with 47% (18/38) of the respondents indicating that their opportunities were either very good or excellent. For spring 2017 (January), 55 total graduate students from SPH programs completed the same survey. Of that total, 50 students provided a rating for their career/professional development opportunities utilizing the sam e scale as the previous year. 42% (21/50) of those students rated the quality of their professional/career development opportunities as very good or excellent. In spring 2018 (January), the HSC altered the survey slightly and added a few additional ques tions about careers. For that cycle, 31 graduate students responded. When asked about professional development/career opportunities, 40% of the 30 students responded to the question with very good or excellent. Additionally, 91% (13 respondents) indicat ed they would feel comfortable talking to their advisor about career opportunities while 77% (18 respondents) indicated they agree or strongly agree with the idea that they have sufficient interactions with faculty to guide their education and career goals . In spring 2019 (January), 15 graduate students responded to the survey. When asked to rate their professional/career development opportunities provided by the school, 60% of students who responded to the question rated the school as very good or excel lent. During that survey cycle, 75% of the responses to the question concerning comfort with talking to their advisor about career opportunities indicated they would agree or strongly agree that they feel comfortable speaking to their advisor or faculty about their career goals. Beginning with the graduating class of Fall 2020, every graduate of the School of Public Health will have either had a one- on-one meeting with or have taken a class taught by the Director of Career Development and Student Success. The relationships building that are a large part of those meetings/classes will lead to a level of comfort with responding to Career Development Exit/Follow - Up surveys. Additionally, the Director of Career Development will be partnering with Academic Advisors at the Graduate and Undergraduate level to have them include the Career Service Exit Survey as part of their final advising appointments and graduation checklists. 277 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 5) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans f or improvement in this area. Strengths: The School created a full -time Director of Career Development & Student success to meet the demands related to career services for students and alumni across all degree programs. Weaknesses: While getting programs and events up to speed in this area, career services program assessment has not been fully implemented. Plans: After an 18- month learning curve and opportunity to better understand university barriers to survey implementation and procedures and process regarding alumni , our plans are to provide a comprehensive survey to all graduates to better understand needs in terms of career development and advising. 278 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 279 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH H3. Student Complaint Procedures The school enforces a set of policies and procedures that govern formal student complaints/grievances. Such procedures are clearly articulated and communicated to students. Depending on the nature and level of each complaint, students are encouraged to voice their concerns to school officials or other appropriate personnel. Designated administrators are charged with reviewing and resolving formal complaints. All complaints are processed through appropriate channels. 1) Describe the procedures by which students may communicate any formal c omplaints and/or grievances to school officials, and about how these procedures are publicized. All WVU SPH students are introduced to the formal grievance/complaint process by familiarizing them with the policies during a morning New Student Orientation (NSO) Overview Session during the mandatory NSO (embed PPT) for 2019 & student -focused website https://provost.wvu.edu/governance/academic -standar ds-resources/faq- for-students/did- you-know and during afternoon break -out sessions conducted by the MS, MPH, and PhD Program Directors (see section H3 in the ERF to view the new student orientation agenda) . Students are also provided information and access to the formal complaint process for grade appeals, behavior and/or sexual misconduct, and all students rights and responsibilities via respective program handbooks (see section H3 in the ERF to view the student handbooks ), student websites https://studentconduct.wvu.edu/home and on all course syllabi. During the 2019 NSO , in an effort to encourage students to exercise and become familiar with their rights and responsibilities, we invited Dr. Hulbert and her staff to provide an overview of her office and resources for students. Syllabi, particularly the highlighted content related to Academic Integrity, are provided to each student with a mandatory University deadline. Syllabi audits are conducted at the department level to ensure that required language for academic policies is included. All program directors send notification regarding any training or education related to Academic Integrity via Mountaineer News and SPH Student ENEWS, and respective listservs. Over the last three years, grievances/complaints have been almost exclusively related to issues involving plagiarism and/or stemming from an action considered by the University to fall under the category of academic dishonesty. In 2018 West Virginia University hired a Director of Academic Integrity (Dr. Azalea Hulbert) https://studentconduct.wvu.edu/staff/director -of-academic -integrity and under her guidance the University has shifted the focus from a punitive stance for academic infractions to one of education. The Academic Dean invited Dr. Hulbert to an October 2018 and March 2019 Academic Affairs regularly scheduled meetings to ensure adeq uate training and knowledge of all formal complaint/grievance policies for Department Chairs, Program Director and Teaching Faculty. This training included a FAQ's session and specific instructions on the mechanisms for engaging that office during a complaint process. Exclusive to WVU SPH undergraduates, there is an appeal process for negative decisions for students requesting a transfer to the BSPH program. The first level of appeal is the Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Studies (ADUGS) and at her discretion for clear -cut decisions, (i.e. students do not meet criteria as published online via SPH webpage and University webpage describing undergraduate major options) . For those instances where a decision is not clear -cut, appeals go to the Academic and Prof essional Standards Committee. This step in the process s communicated directly to the student by the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Studies. The final decision of the APSC is communicated directly to the student by the ADUGS. Depending on the nature of the complaint, West Virginia University requires a specific course of action. Grade appeals and general complaints can initiate and end internal to the SPH. However, matters related to offenses/complaints that require review from the Office of Diversity, E quity and 280 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Inclusion (DEI) , students are protected from having their identity/complaint made public and communication will come directly from that office ( https://diversity.wvu.edu/ ). 2) Briefly summarize the steps for how a complaint or grievance filed through official university processes progresses. Include information on all levels of review/appeal. Grade Appeals The University has implemented a formal grade appeals process that is mandatory for all undergraduate and graduate programs at WVU. The process includes 3 levels of appeal if the issue cannot be addressed by the course instructor in a manner that is satisfactory to all parties. Each decision reached regarding a student grade appeal is reviewed at each level of appeal by the SPH Academic and Professional Standards Committee. Progression to the next level of appeal is at the discretion of the student. 1) A grade appeal by the student is submitted to the Department Chair of the respective course. The Chair's decision is communicated directly to the instructor, with the matter being closed if the student is satisfied with the outcome. If the issue is not addressed in a satisfactory manner, 2) A grade appeal is submitted by the student to the respectiv e Program Director. The Program Director's decision is communicated to the Department Chair with copies to the student and appropriate program director. If still not addressed in a manner that is satisfactory to the student, she/he has the prerogative to continue the process. 3) A grade appeal is submitted to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. The grade appeal is reviewed by the Academic and Professional Standards Committee. The Committee has access to all pertinent evidence, including information submitted in writing by the student. A decision is made based on University policies, and then is communicated to the Department Chair with copies to the student and appropriate program director. The Committee's decision can be appealed to the SPH Dean, who is the final adjudicator of the grade appeal. In addition to the process outlined above, a process specific to PhD comprehensive exam failure is administered by the Health Sciences Center (HSC) Office of Graduate Education and the Biomedical Sciences Program. With a failing score on a second comprehensive exam attempt, the student \"may\" be dismissed from the PhD program. General language and HSC policies that explain policies for program dismissal are explained to PhD students during a mandatory NSO, in group meetings with each incoming cohort, and i n individual advising sessions, all conducted by the PhD Program Director. Additionally, each doctoral advisor explains the policies and procedures for program dismissal at advising meetings during each semester and during mandatory meetings prior to sitti ng for the doctoral candidacy examination. For Epidemiology doctoral candidacy meetings are held with the Department Chair. For Occupational and Environmental Health (OEHS) and Social and Behavioral Sciences, doctoral candidacy meetings are hosted by the s tudents' doctoral dissertation chair. Title IX Violations The Title IX process is administered entirely at the institutional level. WVU's Office of Equity Assurance investigates any Title IX related incidents reported to the University. A report can be filed with WVU's Title IX Coordinator either through an online process or through mail. The griever has the right to file the report anonymously through the Title IX On- Call Line. Information regarding the process can be accessed online at https://titleix.wvu.edu/information- for/information- for-victims 281 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Academic Integrity Violation Violations of academic integrity are handled entirely by the Office of Academic Integrity (OIA) through a standardized system to address infractions. The OIA works to fulfill West Virginia University's commitment to academic honesty. The office engages the campus community in education and outreach and is available to assist both students and facult y in understanding WVU's academic integrity policy and resolving incidents that occur. Final decisions by the OIA regarding a reported infraction are reported to the student directly. More information can be accessed online at https://provost.wvu.edu/governance/academic -standards -resources/academic -integrity -policy . All appeals, the appeal process, final decisions, and communication of the results of an inquiry, are kept in an electronic file in the Academic Dean's Office, unless otherwise directed by University policies. 3) List any formal complaints and/or student grievances submitted in the last three years. Briefly describe the general nature or content of each complaint and the current status or progress toward resolution. 2019 Program Dismissal Appeal (PhD Student) . After two consecutive failures of the EPID Comprehensive Examination, a doctoral student received a letter with template language and handbook citation that described consequences for two consecutive failures of an examination. Student wrote an appeal based on clear language in dismissal letter of the right to do so. Letter addressed to the Academic Dean. Academic Dean sent examination results for \"blind\" review to determine fairness in grading. Review upheld the grade of failure. Academic Dean corresponded to student that appeal based on unfairness in grading, time to preparation, and availability to information regarding the exam not valid. Student was informed of the next level of appeal to the Dean. Student appealed the decision to Dean. Dean found in students favor based in further investigation finding that an oral examination was not given during the second exam as dictated in students' handbook. Student was permitted to take a third examination with committee appointed by the Dean in consultation with the PhD Program Director and the Academic Dean. Student was successful in third attempt in written and oral examination. Program dismissal reversed. PhD Program Director communicated with student results of examination and directed student to form dissertati on committee as part of the advance to candidacy. Grade Appeal (Occupational Medicine Resident) . Student appealed the award of a \"B\" in a class based on the course syllabus that communicated the class as a \"Pass/Fail\" in replace of a letter grade. Student wrote to Occupational Medicine Program Advisor to appeal this action. Program Advisor communicated with the Academic Dean who immediately contacted the Instructor of Record. Error was corrected. 282 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 2018 Plagiarism of Published Authors' Work (PhD student) . For end- of-year assignment in EPID class student turned in a meta- analysis report. Professor utilized TurnItIn Software and determined a 68% match with published work of another author. Student given an \"F\" for the assignment and an Academic Dishonesty for m was filled. Professor provided clear and in- depth communication with student about the plagiarism including the published manuscript, means by which plagiarism was detected and consequences. Academic Dean was consulted about process. Additionally, students' Academic Advisor and Department Chair were copied regarding offense and consequences. Student requested meeting with Academic Dean to \"tell their side of the story.\" Student did not actually appeal grade but rather wanted to provide an explanation for behavior and ask that this action not be held against him/her in future academic settings. Student was assured by Academic Dean that the process was complete and advised to report any perceived prejudice in the future as a result of this event. Failure t o allow student to make -up exam due to a court date (Occupational Medicine Resident) . Student appealed Course Instructor's decision to not allow a make- up exam due to scheduled absence. Academic Dean and Program Advisor reviewed the students' excuse and notified Instructor. Student had a scheduled court date for a child custody hearing, which could not be changed. Academic Dean communicated with Instructor. Make- Up examination allowed. Program Advisor communicated outcome to student. Frequent changes to c ourse syllabus (Occupational Medicine Residents) .

Strengths : The School provides several layers of advising to students to ensure that any changes in academic and/or appeal procedures and policies are communicated to students in a timely manner. Academic Policies and procedures are communicated to students during their respective mandatory orientations, UG, MPH, MS, and MPH Student handbooks, Student ENEWS, on course syllabi, by respective program advisors, and during individual student appointments. We have also taken advantage of several opportunities to remind senior leadership, program directors, and advisors of academic policies and students' rights and responsibilities during scheduled Academic Affairs, Dean's Council, and Program Advisors meetings. We have a very well-articulated and successful feedback loop that begins and ends with the Academic Dean so that closure is achieved. We are pleased that the number of appeals over the last three years are few and attribute this to our efforts focused on student -centric communication. Plans: With the changes in Academic policies and procedures in 2019 we have determined that it is best to appointment and Academic Integrity Officer who can help ensure that students are provided with the appropriate support during a grievance and appeal process commensurate with their catalogue year and in line with University requirements. 285 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH H4.

Strengths: The recruitment process and communication plan for both undergraduate and graduate programs are one of our strengths. Our communication plans laid out for undergraduate and graduate programs are detailed, and have targeted messaging relating to where in the recruitment season we are. They include all facets of communication; email, phone, mail, and social media aspects. They are desig ned to correspond with central communication marketing sent out University wide through WVU communications. Having a robust communication plan allows us to centralize our recruitment communications and actions, such as WVU Discovery Days, applications to o ur program, alumni stories about former SPH experiences with visits to campus. Feedback during the last three years has been overwhelmingly positive regarding recruitment and communications. In the 2018 recruitment cycle we added personal tours as part of our recruitment process. We have received unsolicited feedback regarding the outstanding nature of this personal touch. ( A copy of the parent letter is in section H4 of the ERF) The addition of Dean's Ambassador s ( https://publichealth.hsc.wvu.edu/students/student -resources/scholarships -awards/deans - ambassador -program/ ) to our recruitment process has been identified as a major strength of our recruitment efforts . Weaknesses: The University sets target ed goals and provides extensive formal planning for undergraduate recruitment. Our program would be strengthened by the addition of such resources for graduate recruitment. To date, we have not developed an internal plan for minority recruitment with targeted goals. Plan s: We are in the process of developing a pipeline program to better attract and facilitate the interest, recruitment and retention of West Virginia youth to our BS progr am. 296 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 297 WVU SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH H5.
