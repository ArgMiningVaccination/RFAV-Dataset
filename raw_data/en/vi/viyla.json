The NSU Student Handbook is available online at www.nova.edu/cwis/ studentaffairs /forms/ustudenthandbook.pdf. Changes in the content of the student handbook may be made at anytime, by the university, division, or college administration. Whenever possible, adequate notice of antici-pated changes will be given to the student. This student handbook supersedes all previous handbooks, documents, and directives where they may be in conflict. The student handbook is the governing docu- ment for all program-related information. Please become familiar with the policies and procedures listed within. Failure to read this handbook does not excuse students from the rules, policies, and procedures contained in it. Students are expected to be familiar and comply with all the policies and procedures contained within the student handbook, including any revisions or modifications. Nova Southeastern University reserves the right to amend, modify, add to, or delete its rules, policies, and procedures without notice, affecting its institutional relationship with students as deemed neces-sary by the administration. Any such amendment, modification, addition, or deletion shall not be considered a violation of the relationship between the university and the student. Such right includes modification to academic requirements, curriculum, tuition, and/or fees when in the judgment of the administration such changes are required in the exercise of its educational responsibility. Nondiscrimination Statement Consistent with all federal and state laws, rules, regulations, and/or local ordinances (e.g. Title VII, Title VI, Title III, Title II, Rehab Act, ADA, Title IX), it is the policy of Nova Southeastern University not to engage in discrimination or harassment against any persons because of race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, unfavorable discharge from the military, veteran status, political beliefs or affiliations, and to comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination, equal opportunity and affirmative action laws, orders, and regulations.

NSU admits students of any race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, unfavorable discharge from the military, veteran status, political beliefs or affiliations, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at NSU and does not discriminate in the adminis- tration of its educational policies, admission policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school administered programs. Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility Purpose: This code seeks to promote high standards of behavior and academic integrity by setting forth the responsibilities of students as members of the university community. Abiding by the code ensures a climate wherein all members of the university community can exercise their rights of membership.24 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 Code of Student Conduct Statement The university is a community of scholars in which the ideals of freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom of the individual are sustained. However, the exercise and preservation of these freedoms and rights require a respect for the rights of all in the community to enjoy them to the same extent. It is clear that in a community of learning, willful disruption of the educational process, destruction of property, and interference with the orderly process of the univer - sity as defined by the university administration or with the rights of other members of the university cannot be tolerated. Students enrolling in the university assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the university's function as an educational institution. To fulfill its func-tions of imparting and gaining knowledge, the university retains the power to maintain order within the university and to exclude those who are disruptive to the educational process. In support of the Code of Student Conduct, any violations of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and/or university policies and procedures may result in disciplinary action and/or criminal prosecution. Violations of academic and/or supplementary standards will be handled through the student's academic college, center, or school. Violations of conduct stan- dards, supplementary standards, university policies, and/or procedures will be handled by the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs or by the individual academic college, center, or school as deemed appropriate. Changes to the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will be posted on the Student Affairs Web site. Students are required to be familiar with the rules, policies, and Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility. Nova Southeastern University Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities Nova Southeastern University, as a community of women and men, is committed to furthering schol-arship, academic pursuits, and service to our society. As an institution, our purpose is to ensure all students an equal opportunity to fulfill their intellectual potential through pursuit of the highest standards of academic excellence. Certain rights and obligations flow from membership in any academic community committed to such goals: the rights of personal and intellectual freedom, which are fundamental to the idea of a university scrupulous respect for the equal rights and dignity of others dedication to the scholarly and educational purposes of the university and participation in promoting and ensuring the academic quality and credibility of the institution Students are responsible for obtaining, learning, and observing the established university and academic center policies as listed in all official publications. In addition, students must comply with the legal and ethical standards of the institution, as well as those of Broward County, the state of Florida, as well as any other laws, rules, and/or regulations of other jurisdictions. All members of the community should inform the appropriate official of any violation of conduct regulations. A. Academic Standards The university is an academic community and expects its students to manifest a commitment to academic integrity through rigid observance of standards for academic honesty. The university can function properly only when its members adhere to clearly established goals and values. Accordingly, the academic standards are designed to ensure that the principles of academic honesty are upheld. NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 25The following acts violate the academic honesty standards: 1. Cheating\u2014intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise 2. Fabrication\u2014intentional and unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or cita- tion in an academic exercise 3. Facilitating Academic Dishonesty\u2014intentionally or knowingly helping or attempting to help another to violate any provision of this code 4. Plagiarism\u2014the adoption or reproduction of ideas, words, or statements of another person as one's own without proper acknowledgment Students are expected to submit tests and assignments that they have completed without aid or assis-tance from other sources. Using sources to provide information without giving credit to the original source is dishonest. Students should avoid any impropriety or the appearance thereof in taking examinations or completing work in pursuance of their educational goals. Students are expected to comply with the following academic standards: 1. Original Work Assignments such as course preparations, exams, texts, projects, term papers, practicum, etc., must be the original work of the student. Original work may include the thoughts and words of another author. Entire thoughts or words of another author should be identified using quotation marks. At all times, students are expected to comply with the university and/or program center's recognized form and style manual and accepted citation practice and policy. Work is not original when it has been submitted previously by the author or by anyone else for academic credit. Work is not original when it has been copied or partially copied from any other source, including another student, unless such copying is acknowledged by the person submit-ting the work for the credit at the time the work is being submitted, or unless copying, sharing, or joint authorship is an express part of the assignment. Exams and tests are original work when no unauthorized aid is given, received, or used before or during the course of the examination, re-examination, and/or remediation. 2. Referencing the Works of Another Author All academic work submitted for credit or as partial fulfillment of course requirements must adhere to each program center's specific accepted reference manuals and rules of documentation. Standards of scholarship require that the writer give proper acknowledgment when the thoughts and words of another author are used. Students must acquire a style manual approved by their center and become familiar with accepted scholarly and editorial practice in their program. Students' work must comport with the adopted citation manual for their particular center. At Nova Southeastern University, it is plagiarism to represent another person's work, words, or ideas as one's own without use of a center-recognized method of citation. Deviating from center standards (see above) are considered plagiarism at Nova Southeastern University. 3. Tendering of Information All academic work must be the original work of the student. Knowingly giving or allowing one's work to be copied, giving out exam questions or answers, or releasing or selling term papers is prohibited.26 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 4. Acts Prohibited Students should avoid any impropriety or the appearance thereof, in taking examinations or completing work in pursuance of their educational goals. Violations of academic responsibility include, but are not limited to the following: plagiarism any form of cheating conspiracy to commit academic dishonesty misrepresentation bribery in an attempt to gain an academic advantage forging or altering documents or credentials knowingly furnishing false information to the institution Students in violation will be subjected to disciplinary action. 5. Additional Matters of Ethical Concern Where circumstances are such as to place students in positions of power over university personnel, inside or outside the institution, students should avoid any reasonable suspicion that they have used that power for personal benefit or in a capricious or arbitrary manner. B. Conduct Standards 1. Students should not interfere with the rights, safety, or health of members of the university community nor interfere with other students' right to learn. Students are expected to abide by all university, center, and program rules and regulations and all local, state, and federal laws.

Students should refer to their center and/or Student Affairs Web site for policy updates or changes.28 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 D. Violations Any violation(s) of any of the academic standards, conduct standards, or supplemental standards may result in a complaint being filed against a student to enforce the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility. Deans, associate deans, or directors may, in their discretion, immediately suspend students pending a hearing on charges of academic, conduct, or supplemental standards violations. Violations of academic, conduct, or supplemental standards are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including, expulsion from the university. Violations of academic standards will be handled through the student's academic college, school, or center. Violations of conduct or supple-mentary standards will be handled by the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs or by the individual academic college, school, or center as deemed appropriate. E. Sanctions If the student is found in violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and/or university policies and procedures, one or more of the following sanctions may be imposed. The following list is only illustrative. The university reserves the right to take additional disciplinary action as it deems appropriate. 1. Expulsion Permanent dismissal from the university with no right for future readmission under any circum- stances. A student who has been expelled is barred from campus and/or visiting privileges. 2. Suspension Mandatory separation from the university for a period of time specified in an order of suspension.

Another violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will at a minimum result in suspension. 5. Disciplinary Probation A disciplinary sanction serving notice to a student that his / her behavior is in serious violation of university standards. A time period is indicated during which another violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will automatically raise the question of a more severe sanction (suspension or expulsion) if the student is found in violation. NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 296. Disciplinary Warning A disciplinary sanction serving notice to a student that his / her behavior has not met university standards. This sanction remains in effect for a designated number of semesters of attendance after which it is expunged from the student's file. 7.

In general, students are provisionally admitted to a degree-seeking program based on a review of unofficial transcripts or other specific program admission requirements. However, this admission includes a condition that final and official documents and requirements must be received within 90 calendar days from the start of the term. If these final and official documents and/or requirements are not received by that time, the student will not be allowed to continue class attendance. Financial aid will not be disbursed to a provisional / conditional student until he or she has been fully admitted as a regular student (all admission requirements have been approved by the college / program admission office). Students who have an unpaid balance 30 days from the start of the term will be assessed a $50 fee. Alcohol Policy Nova Southeastern University, as an institution of higher education, is dedicated to the well being of all members of the university community\u2014students, faculty members, employees, and administrators. Concerned with the misuse of alcohol and other drugs (both licit and illicit), it is the policy of NSU to endeavor to prevent substance abuse through programs of education and prevention. NSU recognizes alcoholism and drug abuse as illnesses or treatable disorders, and it is NSU's policy to work with members of the NSU community to provide channels of education and assistance. However, it is the individual's responsibility to seek help. NSU also recognizes that the possession and/or use of certain substances are illegal. NSU is further obligated to comply with all local, state, and federal laws. The policy governing the use of alcohol by students at Nova Southeastern University is in compliance with the laws of the state of Florida prohibiting the consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons who are minors (under the age of 21). The policy is based on the use of alcohol in moderation and under appropriate circumstances. The university recognizes that students are adults and are expected to obey the law and take personal responsibility for their own conduct. The laws of the state of Florida prohibit the possession or consumption of alcohol by individuals less than 21 years of age. 1. The university will not authorize the use of student activity fees or other student funds collected and administered by the university to provide alcoholic beverages for any student event. 2. The sale, delivery, possession, and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages on any property owned and controlled by NSU is strictly prohibited, except as licensed by the state of Florida or otherwise permitted in these regulations. The use of alcoholic beverages on university premises shall be considered a privilege and may be allowed only if consistent with state laws and university regulations, and only when it will not interfere with the decorum and academic atmosphere of the campus. 3. Exception to this prohibition is made for university housing residents of legal drinking age. The possession and use of alcoholic beverages in university housing is governed by the Residential Living Guide.34 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 4. The president, or an appropriate designee, may approve other exceptions to this prohibition, to allow posses sion or consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons of legal drinking age at designated events and locations on campus. 5. The use of alcoholic beverages off campus by students of legal drinking age is permissible. However, incidents of intoxication and/or misconduct are subject to university disciplinary action. Students are expected to comply with municipal, state, and federal laws pertaining to the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Any violation of these laws may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, probation, suspension, or expulsion from the university. Guidelines for the Use of Alcohol at University Student Events 1. Nova Southeastern University functions, which are student oriented, may serve only beer and wine. All requests for such events must be coordinated through NSU's Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. 2. Entry fees may be charged, but this fee is only for admission to the event, not for the sale of beer or wine. 3. One-quarter hour before the approved ending time listed on the exemption, ticket sales will stop. 4. Any advertisements for the event (including leaflets, invitations, posters, letters, and all other forms of advertisements) cannot advertise alcohol. These advertisements must display the following information: Beverages will be available. Must have valid state-issued picture identification for verification of age. 5. An adequate amount of food and alternative beverages (such as water, juice, assorted sodas, coffee, and teas) must be available throughout the duration of the event. These will be provided at the cost of the organization holding the event. The amount of food and beverages appropriate for the size of the event will be determined by the director of the student union. 6. No organization or individual may purchase beer or wine for an event. All beer and wine must be purchased and served by the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. No other alcohol is permitted. 7. The director of the student union or designee will be present during an event at which beer and wine are served. If the director is not available, then a university employee will be designated by the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. The organizational contact of the event must be present during the entire event as a point of contact for the director of the student union or designee. 8. The sponsoring organization is responsible for ensuring that all university policies are strictly obeyed. These guidelines do not override existing university policies, but rather, these guidelines should be used in conjunction with any and all other university policies. 9. Appropriate precautionary measures must be in place to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not served to persons under the legal drinking age. These measures include having a designated individual, as deemed by the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, screening people entering the event and attaching a bracelet or stamp indicating those of legal drinking age. At any time during the event, the screening individual has the option to decline identification provided by an individual. The entire staff working the event has the right to refuse service to individuals deemed as having enough alcohol before or during the event. NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 3510. Under no circumstances should anyone be coerced to drink alcohol. All drinking games, contests, or events that encourage excessive drinking are prohibited. The sponsoring organization is responsible for ensuring that all NSU policies and procedures are strictly obeyed. 11. It shall be at the discretion of the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs whether to make arrangements and pay for any security needs necessary based on the specifics of the event and the number of estimated attendees. 12. Violations of these guidelines during the event may result in the closing of the event. All individual violations will be referred to the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs for review. The university can take disciplinary actions as a result of violations of these guidelines. Abuse / Physical Assault Nova Southeastern University has expectations of the student body to resolve differences in a mature and respectful manner. Physical abuse, verbal abuse, threats, intimidations, coercion, and/or other conduct that threatens or endangers the health, safety, and/or welfare of any other member of the university community on or off campus is prohibited. Acceptance of Professional Fees The activities of students in any other profession, position, or vocation are not to be construed as the practice of medicine, optometry, pharmacy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician assistance, dentistry, public health, law, psychology, counseling, nursing, audiology, and/or education. It is a violation of the law and contrary to the policy of this university for any unlicensed person to engage in the professional practice of health care, law, psychology, audiology, and/or education. Students who are appropriately licensed in a profession may engage in that professional work to the extent provided by the law. (Students of the College of Osteopathic Medicine are required to comply with the College of Osteopathic Medicine's policy and procedure regarding professional work while enrolled.) Arson No student shall commit or aid in the intentional commission of an act that results in a fire being ignited, which causes damage, or is intended to cause damage, to the property of the university or the personal property of any member of the university community. Bomb Threats The placement of a bomb threat is an intolerable violation of university policy, which will result in expulsion from the university. Breaking and Entering The entering, or attempt to enter, any room, building, motor vehicle, or other form of property without proper authorization or consent is prohibited.36 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 Campus Security Report Nova Southeastern University, through the Public Safety Department, annually publishes the Campus Safety and Traffic Handbook, which includes security policies, procedures, practices, and statistics for offenses. Information is also available on the NSU public safety Web site at www.nova .edu/cwis/pubsafety. Cellular Phone Policy The university recognizes the growing trend regarding student possession of cellular phones with video, camera, or voice recording capabilities. In support of each individual's reasonable expectation of privacy, the copyright and intellectual property laws, the use of these cellular phone features by NSU students must be in conjunction with express consent. Students are expressly forbidden to video, use camera or voice recordings without the express consent of the subject(s) being photographed or recorded. Any student whose use of their cellular phone violates another's reasonable expectation of privacy or produces any media as a result of the cellular phone capabilities without express consent may be found in violation of this policy. Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action that may result in confiscation of the cellular phone and referral to Student Affairs as a violation of the NSU Code of Student Conduct. Students are instructed to refer to their center's or college's individual program policies regarding cellular phone use and possession, because additional restrictions may apply. Closing Hours No student is permitted to enter or remain in any university building or facility, including the swimming pool, or in the academic areas of the university, after normal closing hours, unless written approval to do so has been obtained in advance from authorized university personnel. Complicity Students associated with, or present during, the commission of an act(s) by another, which constitutes a violation of university policy, may also be charged if the student's behavior constitutes permission, contributes to, or condones the violation. Computers The following five sections detail NSU policy related to the use of computers, email, and the Internet. Acceptable Use of Computing Resources The following policy is also available at www.nova.edu/common-lib/policies/aucr.policy.html. This policy provides guidelines for the appropriate and inappropriate use of the computing resources of Nova Southeastern University. It applies to all users of the university's computing resources including students, faculty and staff members, alumni, and guests of the university. Computing resources include all computers, related equipment, software, data, local area networks, and listservs for which the university is responsible as well as networks throughout the world to which the university provides computer access. NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 37The computing resources of Nova Southeastern University are intended to be used for its programs of instruction and research and to conduct the legitimate business of the university. All users must have proper authorization for the use of the university's computing resources. Users are responsible for seeing that these computing resources are used in an effective, ethical, and legal manner. Users must apply standards of normal academic and professional ethics and considerate conduct to their use of the university's computing resources.

Romantic or sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class (including supervised student activities for which academic credit is given) may appear to be coercive, and are prohibited. Even when no coercion is present, such relationships create an appearance of impropriety and favoritism, which can impair the academic experience of all students in that class. It is, therefore, improper conduct and prohibited for a faculty member to engage in a romantic or sexual relationship with a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class. Contracting on Behalf of the University Unless specifically authorized by the appropriate university authority, students may not contract on behalf of the university. Students who attempt to, or enter into, a contract on behalf of the university without proper authorization, are subject to disciplinary action that will result in a hold being placed on university records and transcripts until restitution is made, as well as such other sanctions as may be appropriate.

NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 41Disabilities Nova Southeastern University complies with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. No qualified individual with a disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in any activity, service, or program of the university solely by reason of his or her disability. Each qualified individual with a disability who meets the academic and technical standards required to enroll in and participate in Nova Southeastern University's programs shall be provided with equal access to educational programs in the most integrated setting appropriate to that person's needs through reasonable accommodation. At the postsecondary level, it is the student's responsibility to initiate the process for disability services. The process for obtaining a reasonable accommodation is an interactive one that begins with the student's disclosure of disability and a request for a reasonable accommodation. The student has the responsibility to provide Nova Southeastern University with proper documentation of disability from a qualified physician or clinician who diagnoses disabilities and sets forth the recommended accommodations. Student requests for accommodation will be considered on an individual basis. Each student with a disability should discuss his or her needs with the disability service representative in his or her academic center, college, or school before the commencement of classes. For the name and contact information of the disability support services representative at your academic center, college, or school, contact the university ADA coordinator, Arlene Giczkowski, director of student disability services, at (954) 262-7189. Academic Accommodation(s) Process Requests for accommodation must be made in writing to the disability service representative in the student's academic center, college, or school and must be supported by appropriate documentation of recent medical, psychological, or educational assessment data administered and evaluated by a qualified professional. If the student disagrees with the accommodation(s) proposed by the disability service representative in consultation with the appropriate program director and/or faculty member, he or she may appeal the decision through that center's, college's, or school's appellate process. If the issue cannot be satisfactorily resolved at the center, college, or school level, the student may appeal in writing no later than 10 days after the final decision to the university's Academic Accommodation Appellate Committee, which consists of the university's ADA coordinator and representatives from at least four different academic centers, colleges, and/or schools. The student will be given the opportunity to present his or her appeal in an appearance before the committee. The committee will also review all relevant documents submitted with the written appeal before rendering a decision. The student will be notified in writing of the committee's decision within a reasonable amount of time of the hearing. The decision of the university's Academic Accommodation Appellate Committee is final and binding upon the student without further appeal. Academic Accommodation Appellate Committee Guidelines 1. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the ADA coordinator shall schedule a meeting of the committee at a time and place convenient to the student and to the committee members. 2. The student shall have the opportunity to present relevant documents for review by the committee. 3.

Facility and Grounds Accommodation(s) Process Students requesting an accommodation involving modification to a facility or the grounds of the university must meet with the ADA coordinator\u2014the director of student disability services\u2014to discuss their specific needs. Requests for accommodation must be made in writing to the ADA coordinator and be supported by the appropriate documentation of recent medical, psychological, or educational assessment data administered and evaluated by a qualified professional. Requests for an accommodation involving modification to a facility or grounds of the university will be considered on an individual basis. When considering the request, the ADA coordinator will consult with the director of the specific facility (e.g., residential life and housing) involved in the request for accommodation and the director of facilities management. If the student disagrees with the facility or grounds accommodation proposed by the ADA coordinator, he or she may appeal in writing no later than 10 days after the decision to the Facility and Grounds Accommodation Appellate Committee, which consists of the university associate dean of student affairs, vice president of facilities management or his / her designee, and a disability service representative from at least three different academic centers, colleges, and/or schools.

NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 45Failure to Comply All students and guests of NSU are expected to comply with the directives or reasonable requests of university officials acting in the performance of their duties. This requirement includes reasonable requests for students to meet appointments in administrative offices; participation in administration and/or judicial proceedings; and the compliance by the stated deadline with all the terms and conditions of all disciplinary sanctions. Administrative discretion may be used to place a hold on a student's account (registration, grades, etc.) if the student fails to comply with the directions of a university official. False Information Providing false or misleading information to the university or a university official, or to a local, state, or national agency or official is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility subjecting a student to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion or rescission. Falsification of Records Falsification of university records is prohibited. University records include, but are not limited to, admission, enrollment, registration, financial aid, student disciplinary, academic, health records, parking decals / hang tags and student employment records.

Students found in violation of the prohibition against gambling may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.46 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 Grievance Procedures for Nonacademic Disputes This process should be followed for all nonacademic grievances of policies / procedures that are not governed by a specific academic center, program, college, or school. Academic grievances should be referred to the student's academic center. The purpose of these grievance procedures is to promote the orderly resolution of problems arising out of a student complaint concerning a policy, procedure, or administrative action of Nova Southeastern University. Grievances can often be adversarial, unpleasant, and unsatisfying, so we recommend that students discuss problems before resorting to the formal grievance steps. When formal grievance steps are perceived as necessary, students have a right to a fair process and hearing without retribution. 1. First, the student should attempt to resolve an issue in dispute at the level at which the dispute occurred. This attempt must be in writing (i.e., email, regular mail, or fax). The student may wish to use certified mail to verify receipt of the correspondence. In the correspondence, the student must present a rationale for his or her position based on factual information. 2. The student will receive a reply, in writing, which addresses the complaint. 3. If the reply is not acceptable, the student is encouraged to submit the complaint in writing to the associate dean of student affairs. The associate dean of student affairs will attempt to resolve the dispute. 4. If the associate dean is unable to resolve the dispute, he or she will notify the student and the dean of student affairs in writing. 5. The student may then appeal in writing to the dean of student affairs. 6. The dean will investigate and review the findings, and will notify the student in writing of his or her decision. 7. The dean's decision is final and binding and cannot be appealed. Guests Students are welcome to bring guests to the campus, but must assume responsibility for the conduct of their guests and must accompany them at all times. If a guest is asked to leave a specific area of campus, it is the responsibility of the student host to cooperate with the university official making the request. The university reserves the right to exclude all guests from any area on campus in times of impending or actual crises or emergencies, such as hurricanes, campus disruptions, or bomb threats, and to exclude any guest(s) from any area of the campus for any reason the university deems appropriate. Health Policies Communicable Diseases Guidelines It is the intent of the university to protect students from communicable diseases that pose reasonable risk of harm to members of the university community. It is also the intent of the university to protect the rights of those infected with a communicable disease. Students who do become infected with a communicable disease must report the contacting of the disease to their program dean and the associate dean of student affairs and are subject to the guidelines listed below. The university will be flexible in its response to incidents of communicable diseases, evaluating each occurrence in light of this policy and current available medical information. NSU will make available to the university community detailed information concerning the transmissibility of communicable diseases and precautions that can be taken to prevent the spread of various communicable diseases. NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 47 Infected students can continue to study and work as long as they are able to continue to perform regular responsibilities satisfactorily, and as long as the best available medical evidence indicates that their continual status does not present a health or safety threat to themselves or others. An infected student returning to school after a leave of absence for reasons related to a communicable disease must provide a statement from the treating physician indicating current medical status. Students should submit their statement to their program dean or appropriate designee based on the policies of their respective college, school, or center, and the associate dean of students. Within reason, the university will make accommodations to the infected person, whenever possible, to ensure continuity in the classroom. No infected student may be dismissed from the university solely on the basis of a diagnosis of an infection of a contagious disease. A decision to dismiss or discharge will only be made after reasonable accommodation has been attempted, and an examination of facts demonstrates that the infected person can no longer perform essential requirements of the position or program, or poses a reasonable threat to the health and safety of others. In the event that a student has a concern about the potential for the spread of a communicable disease within the university community, those concerns should be brought to the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs for review consistent with the current available information on the spread of the particular communicable disease. After review and evaluation of the concerns, if there appears to be a reasonable likelihood of the spread of the disease within the university community by an infected person, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs will, after notification of the issues presented to the university president, contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or Broward Health Department for recommendations of appropriate action consistent with state law.

Interference with University Investigations and Disciplinary Proceedings Interference with university investigations, administrative procedures, or disciplinary proceedings, or judicial proceedings such as those conducted by the Department of Public Safety, Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, Department of Residential Life, or any other university office authorized to conduct investigations or disciplinary proceedings is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of force, threat of force, coercion, or promise of reward to any person or property of persons involved in university investigations or disciplinary proceedings. No person may, without authorization, examine, take possession of, alter, or destroy university investigations or destroy university records or evidence. Interference with university investigations, disciplinary proceedings, or records may result in disciplinary action. In an effort to foster and provide an environment free from bias or prejudice for the parties involved, publication (verbal or written communication(s)) regarding any university investigatory, administrative, disciplinary, or judicial proceeding is prohibited, if the publication is deemed by the appropriate official overseeing the proceeding to compromise the impartiality and integrity of the proceeding. Communication related to the proceeding will be limited to identified individuals using administrative discretion on a need-to-know basis. Jurisdiction of University Policies and Procedures Students must adhere to NSU policies and procedures on the main campus; at any other NSU site; or while participating in any university-sponsored program, event, or activity. Lake Swimming Swimming in any lake, canal, and/or body of water on the Nova Southeastern University campus is strictly prohibited and any violators of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action. Life-Threatening Behavior Nova Southeastern University recognizes that certain life-threatening behavior (e.g., suicide threats, gestures, or attempts; eating disorders; substance abuse; threats, gestures, or attempts to harm others) is a sign of personal distress. The university is committed to helping students alleviate whatever stress factors are precipitating life-threatening behavior by providing support and/or referral through use of appropriate resources. However, since it is critically important to maintain civility and respect 52 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 for all members of the university community, it is recognized that action must be taken when such behavior is considered by the university to be disruptive to and unacceptable in the academic and social / living environment. Littering / Projecting Objects Students may not throw, discard, place, or deposit litter or project objects from university buildings or on university grounds except in receptacles provided for such purposes. Misuse of Telephones NSU students who misuse telephone lines or university accounts will be subject to disciplinary action and restitution. Noise The university noise policy is based on the belief that all students have a responsibility to respect the rights, health, security, and safety of other university and community members. Excessive noise that disturbs the campus environment, unless approved by the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs or designee for a special event, is not allowed. Students are held responsible for the actions of their guests. Off-Campus Violations The university reserves the right to take disciplinary action for violations of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and university policies and procedures, even when they occur off campus. Parent / Legal Guardian Notification University personnel may use administrative discretion in parental or legal guardian notification in writing and/or by phone of a student under 21 years of age when alcohol or drug violations of the university occur or when a student's welfare is at issue. Parking and Traffic Policies In order to park a motor vehicle on campus in any university parking area, the vehicle must be registered with the university, and a parking permit must be properly displayed. All administrators, faculty members, staff members, students, and visitors must register vehicles to be driven or parked on campus. All administrators, faculty members, staff members, students, and visitors are responsible for any violations of these regulations in which their vehicle is involved. Motorcycles, motor scooters, and mopeds are subject to the regulations governing automobiles. The Public Safety Department is authorized to designate any spaces as temporary reserved parking. Abandoned vehicles are subject to towing at the owner's expense, unless the owner notifies the Public Safety Department in writing at the time the vehicle becomes disabled. The executive director of public safety will determine whether a disabled vehicle is allowed to remain on campus. NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 53 Vehicle repairs that create a nuisance are not permitted on campus. Any property damage caused by the making of any repairs is the responsibility of the person making such repairs. Trailers or mobile campers are allowed to be parked on campus only with written permission from the executive director of public safety. The maximum speed on any NSU driveway or roadway excluding those owned and managed by the town of Davie, Broward County, or the state of Florida is 15 miles per hour or less. All vehicle operators must obey public safety and police direction and instructions regarding operating and parking motor vehicles. Nova Southeastern University assumes no liability for damages to any vehicle parked or driven on campus . For additional information, please visit the public safety Web site at www.nova.edu/cwis/pubsafety. Pets No pets or animals, other than fish, are permitted on campus, including all residence halls, with the exception of service animals. Privacy of Records (FERPA) Several laws provide significant safeguards for the protection of the privacy rights of students with respect to educational records and/or personally identifiable information. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) specifically protects the privacy of a student's educational record and limits the disclosure of personally identifiable information maintained by the university. Records or reports that include personally identifiable information about a student are to be maintained in a confidential manner that is consistent with university policy and procedure. FERPA clarifies the limits of access to educational records, including the right to access, the right to inspect, the right to obtain copies, the right to seek correction through formal and informal internal procedures, and the right to place a statement in the educational records explaining information the student believes to be inaccurate or misleading. NSU has adopted a policy consistent with the requirements of FERPA, with respect to student educational records. Please carefully review the NSU FERPA policy online at www.nova .edu/cwis/finaid/information/ferpa.html. The law limits access by, and disclosure of, educational records to a third party. All educational records, except directory information, are confidential and cannot be disclosed unless written consent is given by the student or in such circumstances that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom NSU has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); or a student serving on an official committee (such as a disciplinary or grievance committee); or a student assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the university may disclose educational records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. The following information may be released as directory information, but 54 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 can be withheld at the request of the student: student name, address, dates of attendance, degree, honors and awards received, telephone numbers, enrollment status, major field of study, year in school, participation in sports, anticipated graduation date, NSU email address, and place of birth. The university reserves the right to refuse to provide the above information, if the reason for the request is not considered valid or sufficient. Students may complete and submit a Request to Prevent Disclosure of Directory Information to the Office of the University Registrar before September 1 of the current academic year. However, students do not have the right to access educational records until they have been admitted to, and have begun attending classes at, NSU. NSU will not release educational records to the parent(s) of a dependent student unless proof of the student's dependency is provided by the parent(s) via a copy of the U.S. Federal Income Tax Return and the student has provided a written request allowing NSU to disclose information to the parent(s). The university will convene a hearing if a student and/or authorized parent(s) wish to challenge the contents of an educational record. Students and authorized parent(s) may add explanatory or rebuttal statements to the student's educational record, if the hearing yields unsatisfactory results. If a student or authorized parent(s) is denied access to a hearing, or if the educational records are alleged to have been illegally disclosed to a third party, the student may file a complaint with the federal Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO), charged with administering FERPA. The U.S. Department of Education's Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) is available online at www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa. Procedure to Inspect Educational Records Students may inspect and review their educational records upon request to the appropriate record custodian. Transcripts submitted to the university from prior schools become the property of NSU and can be reviewed, but copies cannot be released. Students should submit to the record custodian or an appropriate university staff member a written request that identifies as precisely as possible the record or records he or she wishes to inspect. The record custodian or an appropriate university staff member will make the needed arrangements for access as promptly as possible and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. Access must be given 45 days or fewer from the receipt of the request. When a record contains information about more than one student, the student may inspect and review only the record that relates to him or herself. Right of University to Refuse Access The university or division reserves the right to refuse inspection of the following records: financial records of the student's parents, or any information contained therein letters and statements of recommendations concerning admission or employment for which the student has waived his or her right of access records connected with an application to attend university or component unit of the university if that application was denied those records that are excluded from FERPA definition of educational records Refusal to Provide Copies The university reserves the right to deny requests for transcripts or copies of records that are not required to be made available by the FERPA in either of the following situations: the student has an unpaid financial obligation to the university there is an unresolved disciplinary action against the student NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 55Health Care Privacy (HIPAA) Statement The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires health care providers to abide by the regulations for privacy and confidentiality of protected health information (PHI). The HIPAA privacy rule covers all individually identifiable health information at Nova Southeastern University health care centers whether the information is electronic, paper, or spoken. Because NSU operates health care centers, it is responsible for enacting privacy policies and procedures. The various NSU colleges, schools, and educational programs have enacted policies for their health care centers. NSU health care center staff members, students, and faculty members are responsible for following the policies that have been implemented by the applicable NSU health care center. In addition, the HIPAA privacy rule also requires that NSU provides education for health care center staff members, students, and faculty members. As such, all applicable NSU colleges, schools, and educational programs shall train their students rotating at NSU health care centers and other health care facilities in compliance with the requirements of NSU's HIPAA privacy policies and procedures, patient privacy and confidentiality practices, privacy laws, and the federal HIPAA privacy regulations. NSU students and faculty members may also be subject to the HIPAA privacy policies and procedures enacted by the various health care facilities in which they train. It is the responsibility of the student and faculty member to familiarize himself or herself with these policies upon entering each facility. Any questions concerning the policies can be directed to the privacy contact of your NSU health care center or the NSU privacy officer. Public Laws Students are responsible for compliance with all public laws. Any act that could constitute a violation of public laws will establish cause for legal and/or disciplinary action by the university. Sexual Misconduct and Harassment The following three sections relate to NSU policy and definitions of sexual misconduct and sexual harassment. Sexual Misconduct Policy NSU, in compliance with the spirit of various federal and state laws (e.g., Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and other similar state and federal statutes or regulations), adopts the policy and fosters an environment where no individual may threaten the health, safety, and welfare of a member of the university community; or any person on university property; or at a university-sponsored or -supervised activity, through the commission of a sexual assault, engaging in sexual harassment, discrimination, battery, and/or misconduct, including acquaintance rape. Definition: NSU acknowledges acquaintance rape in its definition of sexual assault. Acquaintance rape is defined as forced, manipulated, or coerced sexual intercourse by a friend or acquaintance. It is an act of violence, aggression, and power, in which the victim, under protest or without consent, is forced to experience a sexual act through verbal coercion, threats, physical restraint, and/or physical violence. Consideration and rights to be afforded to all campus community members regarding the type of sexual assault: a. the right to have all sexual assaults against them treated with seriousness; and the right, as victims, to be treated with dignity56 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 b. the right to have sexual assaults committed against them investigated and adjudicated by the duly constituted criminal and civil authorities of the governmental entity in which the crimes occurred; and the right to the full and prompt cooperation and assistance of campus personnel in notifying the proper authorities c. the right to be free from pressure that would suggest that the victims: (i) not report crimes committed against them to civil and criminal authorities or to the campus public safety and disciplinary official; or (ii) report crimes as lesser offenses than the victims perceive them to be d. the right to be free from suggestions that sexual assault victims not report, or underreport, crimes because (i) victims are somehow responsible for the commission of crimes against them; (ii) victims were contributorially negligent or assumed the risk of being assaulted; or (iii) by reporting crimes, they would incur unwanted personal publicity e. the right to the full and prompt, reasonable cooperation from campus personnel in responding to the incident f. the right to have access to counseling services established by the university or other victim- service entities g. after campus sexual assaults have been reported, the victims of such crimes shall have the right to require that campus personnel take the necessary steps or actions reasonably feasible to prevent unwanted contact with, or proximity to, alleged assailants h. the right to be informed of disciplinary proceedings, as well as the outcome of such proceedings i. the same right to assistance, or ability to have others present, that is afforded to the accused during any campus disciplinary proceedings Disciplinary Action: In addition to any criminal or civil actions that may be pending or in process, the university reserves the right to pursue separate disciplinary action against any individual who violates any portion of this policy. Education and Information: The university, through the departments of the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, residential life, recreation and wellness, and public safety, provides educational and informational programs and materials regarding awareness of rape, acquaintance rape, and other sex offenses. This information is provided through scheduled and on-demand programs. Nova Southeastern University students are encouraged to report to the police (9-911 on campus and 911 off campus), public safety (extension 28999 on campus and (954) 262-8999 off campus), and a university administrator all occurrences of sexual assault, either violent assault or acquaintance (date) rape. Professional staff members in the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, residential life, student counseling, and public safety are among those who are trained and willing to assist students who are victims of sexual assault. If the victim then reports the crime to an administrator, the following procedure will prevail. Third-Party Reports: When there is a report of sexual assault, the person receiving the report whether a student , faculty member, or staff member is encouraged, in turn, to report the incident to a student life and/or residential life administrator. If the person reporting that assault is a third party (not the victim), the administrator will do the following: a. advise the reporter to counsel the victim to seek medical assistance b. advise the reporter to encourage the victim to talk with a counselor from the Rape Center in Broward County, a staff counselor at the University Counseling Center, a student affairs and/or residential life administrator, the director of public safety, or some other university official c. protect the confidentiality of the victim (if name is known) NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 57 Victim Reports: If a student who is a victim of sexual assault reports the matter to a university administrator or any other university employee, the administrator and/or employee will encourage the victim to seek immediate medical attention and assist the victim in appropriate methods and avenues to receive medical care. In reporting a sexual assault, the victim controls the process. The administrator and/or employee will encourage the victim to authorize notification of the university Public Safety Office (PSO) of the occurrence of the crime, and then to cooperate with PSO and student life and/or residential life and housing in reporting the matter to the rape victim advocate in the state attorney's office and to local police. The victim will be assured of university support including reasonable confidentiality, full cooperation with any police investigation, and counseling through the University Counseling Center and the Rape Crisis Center. If the victim authorizes the notification of PSO, the administrator and/or employee will inform the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, which will assist as liaison with PSO. Harassment Statement Harassment is defined as any conduct (words or acts), whether intentional or unintentional or a product of the disregard for the safety, rights, or welfare of others, which causes physical, verbal, or emotional harm; or conduct, which intimidates, degrades, demeans, threatens, hazes, or otherwise interferes with another person's rights to comfort and right to be free of a hostile environment. This includes, but is not limited to, loud or aggressive behavior; behavior that disrupts the orderly functioning of the university; disturbs the peace and/or comfort of person(s) on the campus of the university; creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. It also includes any conduct (words or acts) in which the university can determine a threat exists to the educational process or to the health or safety of a member of the NSU community. Sexual Harassment Policy It is the intent of Nova Southeastern University to protect all employees and students from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Sexual harassment undermines the integrity of the employment and academic environment, debilitates morale, and interferes with the effectiveness of employees and students. In accordance with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's promulgated guidelines, unwelcome sexual advances, unwanted requests for favors of a sexual nature, and any other unwanted verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature are considered sexual harassment if explicit or implicit submission to sexual overtones is made a term or condition of employment or academic program status employment or academic program status decisions are made on the basis of whether submission to or rejection of sexual overtones occurred a sexually intimidating, hostile, or offensive atmosphere unreasonably interferes with an individual's work or academic program status performance At Nova Southeastern University, sexual harassment of or by employees or students includes: 1. unwelcome or unwanted sexual advances. This includes unwelcome physical contact or sexual advances considered unacceptable by another individual. 2. requests or demands for sexual favors. This includes subtle or blatant pressures or requests for any type of sexual favor, accompanied by an implied or stated promise of preferential treatment or negative consequence concerning one's employment or academic program status.58 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 3. verbal abuse that is sex-oriented or considered unacceptable by another individual, as well as sexually derogatory comments. This includes commenting about an individual's body or appearance when such comments go beyond mere courtesy, telling jokes that are clearly unwanted and considered offensive by others, or other tasteless sexually oriented comments, innuendoes, or actions that offend others. 4. engaging in any type of sexually oriented conduct that would unreasonably interfere with another's work or academic program status performance. This includes extending unwanted sexual attention to someone that reduces personal productivity or time available to work at assigned tasks. 5. creating a work or academic program status environment that is intimidating, hostile, or offensive because of unwelcome or unwanted sexually-oriented conversations, suggestions, requests, demands, physical contacts, or attentions. Nova Southeastern University will not tolerate sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is an insidious practice. It demeans individuals being treated in such a manner, and creates unacceptable stress for the entire organization. Persons harassing others will be dealt with swiftly and vigorously. Normal, non-coercive interaction that is acceptable to both parties is not considered to be sexual harassment. All allegations of sexual harassment of or by an employee, client, or vendor will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the Office of Human Resources and should be reported promptly to the Director of Human Resources. At Nova Southeastern University, sexual harassment by employees of students is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when 1. submission to such conduct is made to appear to be a term or condition of enrollment, attendance, or participation in a class 2. submission to or rejection of such conduct affects academic decisions 3. such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with a student's academic performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive academic environment 4. unwelcome physical contact, including but not limited to patting, pinching, or touching 5. offensive or demeaning sexual remarks, jokes, or gestures Students aggrieved by a violation of this policy may file a grievance under their center's grievance procedure, or may report the conduct to the dean of the center, any other faculty member or the director of human resources. All reports of sexual harassment will be thoroughly investigated by the Office of Human Resources. Any individual who violates any portion of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. At Nova Southeastern University, romantic and sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student are subject to the prohibition against sexual harassment. Romantic or sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class (including supervised student activities for which academic credit is given) may appear to be coercive, and are prohibited. Even when no coercion is present, such relationships NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 59create an appearance of impropriety and favoritism, which can impair the academic experience of all students in that class. It is; therefore, improper conduct and prohibited for a faculty member to engage in a romantic or sexual relationship with a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class. Smoking Policy The university has adopted a \"no smoking\" policy in accordance with the Florida Clean Indoor Air Act, and evidence that indicates that passive smoking, i.e., involuntary inhalation of pollutants in the air produced by the smoking of others, is potentially harmful to nonsmokers in the closed environment of our buildings. Accordingly, it is determined that there is no smoking in any Nova Southeastern University classroom / administrative facility. Effective in July 2009, Nova Southeastern University has adopted a smoking restriction policy to promote healthy lifestyles and ensure clean air around campus buildings, while greatly reducing exposure to second-hand smoke. A \"Healthy Sharks\" initiative will prohibit smoking everywhere on campus except at designated smoking sites located at least 50 feet from buildings. Smoking will be prohibited in all other areas of NSU campuses and student educational centers throughout Florida. To locate the smoking sites on Nova Southeastern University campuses, log into the NSU Web site at www.nova.edu. Solicitation and Posting Policy All on-campus sales and solicitations must be operated or sponsored by a university-recognized student organization and must receive the proper authorization. The Office of Residential Life and Housing must approve sales and solicitations in the residence halls. The following flyers are acceptable looking for a roommate selling a car, book, furniture, etc. events or information associated with NSU clubs and organizations events or information associated with NSU administrative offices or academic programs academic services and programs associated with NSU The following flyers are not acceptable in any campus location publicity making any reference to drugs or alcohol, containing discriminatory language, or containing inappropriate photos, graphics, or language outside vendor or company promotions outside vendor health insurance information Academic centers, colleges, schools, residence halls, and campus buildings may have their own specific solicitation and posting policies. Visit www.nova.edu/studentleadership/forms/posting_policy.pdf for more information.60 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 Stalking Any individual who willfully, knowingly, maliciously, or repeatedly follows; harasses; attempts to contact or communicate (written, verbal or electronic); and makes a credible threat placing the individual in reasonable fear of death or bodily harm may be in violation of NSU's stalking policy. Such conduct is prohibited. Stalking causes substantial emotional distress in individuals and serves no legitimate purpose. Course of conduct means a pattern of conduct composed of a series of acts over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose. Student Publications Nova Southeastern University, as publisher, bears the legal responsibility for the contents of student publications. In the delegation of editorial responsibility to students, the university provides sufficient editorial freedom for the student publications to maintain their integrity of purpose as vehicles of free inquiry and free expression in the Nova Southeastern University academic community. The delegated editorial freedom of student editors and managers is subject to corollary responsibilities to be governed by the canons of responsible journalism, such as the avoidance of libel; indecent, undocumented allegations; attacks on personal integrity; and the techniques of harassment and innuendo. As safeguards for the delegated editorial freedom of student publications, the following provisions are made: the student press shall be free of censorship and advance approval of copy, and its editors and managers shall be free to develop their own editorial policies and news coverage editors and managers of student publications shall be protected from arbitrary suspension and removal because of student, faculty, administrative, or public disapproval of editorial policy or content. Only for proper and stated causes shall editors and managers be subject to removal, and then by orderly and prescribed procedures all university published and financed student publications shall explicitly state on the editorial page that the opinions therein expressed are not necessarily those of Nova Southeastern University or of the student body Theft or Unauthorized Possession Students involved in the taking, sale, or possession of property without the consent of its owner or without proper remuneration may be subject to university disciplinary action and a fine, as well as arrest and prosecution by legal authorities. Title IX Compliance Policy Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, 20 USC Sections 1681 et seq., prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in schools, whether in academics or athletics. In furtherance of Title IX, Nova Southeastern University has adopted a Title IX Compliance Policy. It is the university's policy that no student enrolled at NSU shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. The Title IX coordinator at NSU is Gay Holliday, associate dean of student affairs, who can be reached at (954) 262-7280. Students are entitled to file a grievance or complaint with the Office of the Title IX Coordinator if they perceive they have been a victim of discrimination on the basis of sex. NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 61Travel Students are responsible for adherence to the university code of conduct and all university policies and procedures while attending or participating in university-sponsored programs, activities, and/or events off of the main campus or at any NSU sites. The travel office provides basic travel services for students, faculty members, and staff members. Please visit the travel office Web site for a current listing of NSU discounts with airline, car rental companies, and hotels at www.nova.edu/cwis/bsv/travel. Trespass Policy Nova Southeastern University reserves the right to prohibit trespass onto its property. University employees whose duties include building or property supervision or the general safety and protection of persons or property may issue a trespass warning. A trespass warning may be issued to students or nonstudents and may apply to an individual's vehicle, as well. The revocation of a person's privilege to be on the lands, within the buildings, or on the premises of the university may be restricted to time and place by the agent of the university issuing the trespass warning. Unauthorized Entry Any student who enters, attempts to enter, or remains in any room, building, motor vehicle, trailer, or machinery without proper authorization may be subject to university disciplinary action, as well as arrest and prosecution by legal authorities. Unauthorized Possession of University Property Students in possession of property owned or controlled by Nova Southeastern University without authorization for such property will be subject to university disciplinary action and/or restitution. In addition, students may be referred to legal authorities for prosecution. Use of University Vehicles Nova Southeastern University policy mandates that all personnel , staff, and students who either are required to or wish to use an NSU van must first successfully complete the Van Driver Training course provided by NSU Public Safety. The Public Safety Department provides as its van driver training course the most current version available, Coaching the Van Driver II, which is offered by FLI Learning Systems, Inc. Prior to contacting Public Safety, a supervisor must first contact the director of risk management at (954) 262-5271 to determine a person's eligibility to drive an NSU van. After receiving approval, an appointment can then be made with Jim Ewing, Public Safety-Safety Compliance, at (954) 262-8082, or at jewing@nsu.nova.edu. The van training program is available most weekdays, during daytime hours, instead of just once a month during the evening. Upon satisfactorily passing the Van Driver II training, the person will receive a certificate of completion as well as an identification card, which is used to sign out an NSU van from the Physical Plant.62 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 Vandalism or Destruction of University Property Defacing, littering, or damaging property of the university is prohibited. Weapons Weapons are prohibited on campus.

Enrollment and Student Services Enrollment and Student Services (ESS) is composed of the Office of Student Financial Assistance, the University Registrar's Office, the University Bursar's Office, the One-Stop Shop, the University Call Center, Enrollment Processing Services, and Transfer Evaluation Services. Collectively, the ultimate goal of ESS is to efficiently meet the information and service needs of all NSU students. The following is important information regarding financial aid, NSU billing and payment policies, and general financial tips. The Office of Student Financial Assistance The Office of Student Financial Assistance is dedicated to helping student's make smart financial choices while in college. There are four types of financial aid available to assist in meeting the cost of attending college: grants, scholarships, student employment, and loans. Grants and scholarships are considered \"gift\" aid, as they do not need to be repaid. Loans are considered \"self-help\" aid, as they need to be repaid. Student employment requires the student to work in exchange for a pay check. Please remember that students interested in federal grants must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and meet general eligibility criteria. Means of Communication with Students The official means of communicating financial aid information to students is via WebSTAR and NSU email. Students will receive requests for information and award notices through their NSU email accounts. They will then be directed to the WebSTAR secure site to use their NSU PIN for access to pertinent financial aid information. Students are encouraged to use NSU's WebSTAR system at www.webstar.nova.edu to register for classes, display their class schedule, view any holds, display their grades and transcripts, make payments, and review financial aid requirements and awards. The University Bursar's Office The Office of the University Bursar is responsible for billing students, collecting and depositing student payments, issuing refunds from excess financial aid funds, and verifying students' eligibility for a student loan. Bursar's Office policies Registration will be processed unless there is a hold on the student's account. Electronic bills are sent during the middle of each month via email to the student's NSU email address. No paper bills are sent. Students can authorize additional users to receive an NSU eBill notification by signing the person on as an authorized user.70 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 If a student owes a balance 30 days after the start of the term, a hold and a $50 late fee will be placed on the account. This hold prevents future registrations, the viewing of grades, and access to the RecPlex at the Don Taft University Center. If a balance exists after 90 days, the account will be placed in collections. Methods of Payment NSU accepts VISA, MasterCard, and American Express. Check payments include traveler's checks, cashier's checks, and personal checks, as well as money orders. International checks must be in U.S. funds only and drawn on a U.S. bank. Wire transfers are accepted. More information regarding wire transfers is available at www.nova.edu/cwis/bursar/registration.html.

Electronic check and credit card payments can also be made through NSU eBill. Credit card authorization forms can be downloaded from the Bursar's Web site at www.nova.edu/cwis/bursar/forms/ccauthform.pdf and faxed to (954) 262-2473. Payment Plans Some graduate program offices offer payment plan options. Please check the program's Web site for details.

Florida Prepay PlanStudents will be invoiced based on their term credit hours and the current Florida state tuition rate. If a student is on the unrestricted plan, the student must designate a dollar amount for up to the cost of tuition and fees. Transfer students must contact Florida Prepay to transfer the account to NSU. A copy of the front and back of the ID card is required each term. NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 71Student Employment There are three main student employment programs: Federal Work-Study (FWS), Nova Student Employment, and Job Location and Development (JLD). Federal Work Study Program The FWS Program is a need-based program that provides students with part-time employment to help meet their financial need. FWS is awarded to U.S. citizens and resident aliens. Students must be awarded FWS in order to apply and obtain a position. Interested students must file a FAFSA, and indicate on the FAFSA that they are interested in a work-study program. Students may work up to 25 hours per week, depending on eligibility. The rate varies according to the position. When calculating the balance owed to NSU, do not deduct FWS, as you would other aid. The Bursar's Office does not calculate the award as expected payment towards tuition. Students will receive a paycheck every other week. Under the umbrella of FWS are the America Reads and America Counts programs. Students serve as reading or math tutors to elementary school children throughout Broward County. Students must have their own dependable transportation. The minimum number of hours students can work is 10 hours per week. The pay rate is $13 an hour. Tutors must complete a training session and pass a background check. Students can't participate in both programs. Students who have been awarded FWS for the fall term will be sent a student employment packet in the mail at the end of July. The packet will include the student employment application as well as information regarding the orientation process. Nova Student Employment Nova Student Employment provides part-time, on-campus jobs for in-school students, regardless of financial need. Students do not need to apply for financial aid to be considered for these positions. International students may qualify for on-campus student employment under this program. Students can work a maximum of 20 hours per week. Job Location and Development The JLD Program develops and locates off-campus jobs for students. Positions are open to all currently enrolled students of NSU, regardless of financial need.

Standards of Progress for Veterans A student receiving veterans benefits must maintain satisfactory progress. Students will be considered to be making satisfactory progress as long as they meet the academic standards set by their school for retention in their degree programs. 72 NSU Student Handbook 2009-2010 A student who, at the end of any evaluation period, has not attained and maintained satisfactory progress will be certified, in a probationary status, for only one additional evaluation period. Should this student not attain, and maintain, satisfactory progress by the end of the probationary period (one evaluation period), the student's Veterans Affairs (VA) educational benefits will be terminated for unsatisfactory progress. A student whose VA educational benefits have been terminated for unsatisfactory progress may petition the school to be recertified after one evaluation period has elapsed. To initiate the petition process, students should contact the Office of Student Financial Assistance VA benefits representative at 800-541-6682, ext. 27236. The school may recertify the student for VA educational benefits only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the student will be able to attain and maintain satisfactory progress for the remainder of the program. For VA payment of benefits purposes, an I (Incomplete) designation for a course must be converted to a credit grade counting toward graduation, or a failing grade, by the end of one calendar year, unless permission for a delay is granted by the academic dean for that program. Grade/Progress Reports for Students Receiving Veterans Benefits Each VA student will be provided a grade/progress report at the end of every evaluation period (e.g., term, semester). A copy of each report will be placed in the student's permanent file maintained by the school. The university periodically furnishes each student with a working transcript that shows current status of grades and earned semester hours for all courses completed and/or attempted, plus grades for courses in which the student is currently enrolled. Conduct Policy for Students Receiving Veterans Benefits All VA students are expected to comply with the legal and ethical standards of Nova Southeastern University. Academic dishonesty and/or nonacademic misconduct will result in disciplinary action. Specific instances of misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, knowingly furnishing false information to the institution, and forging or altering institution documents and/or academic credentials.
