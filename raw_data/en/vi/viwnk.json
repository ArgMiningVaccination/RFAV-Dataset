Rooks, MS, Thanh-Tam Thi Le, MD, Inocente O. Santiago III, MD, Jeffrey Diamond, BS, Nicholas L. Dorsey, MD, andArch G. Mainous III, PhD Introduction: To date, there are no effective treatments for decreasing hospitalizations in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. It has been suggested that the influenza vaccine might attenuate the severity of COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective single-centered cohort review of a de-identied database of 2005 patients over the age of 18 within the University of Florida health care system who tested positive forCOVID-19. Comorbidities and influenza vaccination status were examined. The primary outcome was severity of disease as reflected by hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Logisticregression was performed to examine the relationship between influenza status and hospitalization. Results: COVID-19-positive patients who had not received the influenza vaccination within the last year had a 2.44 (95% CI, 1.68, 3.61) greater odds of hospitalization and a 3.29 (95% CI, 1.18, 13.77)greater odds of ICU admission when compared with those who were vaccinated. These results were controlled to account for age, race, gender, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis- ease, obesity, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. Discussion: Our analysis suggests that the influenza vaccination is potentially protective of moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 infection. This protective effect holds regardless of comorbidity. The lit-erature points to a potential mechanism via natural killer cell activation. Though our data potentiallyis limited by its generalizability and our vaccination rate is low, it holds signicant relevance given the upcoming influenza season. Not only could simply encouraging influenza vaccination decrease morbid- ity and mortality from the flu, but it might help flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic as well. Weencourage further studies into this nding. ( J Am Board Fam Med 2021;34:S179-S182.)

Downloaded from authors have suggested that in fluenza vaccination may create a virus interference where vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respira- tory viruses because they do not receive the nonspe- cic immunity associated with natural infection.6-8 The data on in fluenza vaccination interference is mixed.8The objective of this project was to investi- gate if being up to date on in fluenza vaccinations is associated with a less severe response to COVID-19infection as indicated by hospitalizations. Methods Data for this project was obtained from a research databank containing de-identi ed information from the electronic health records (EHR) of patients testedfor COVID-19 in the University of Florida (UF) Health system. Usage of the databank for research isnot considered human subjects research and Institutional Review Board review was not required to conduct this study. The cohort for this study con- sisted of all adult patients (18 years and older) with a conrmed diagnosis of COVID-19, between the dates of March and August, who established care at UF Health at least 1 year before their earliest con- rmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The presence of a positive laboratory test for COVID-19 in the EHRwas used to con rm COVID-19 diagnoses. Each patient' si nfluenza vaccination status was determined using billing codes located in the EHR. Patients wereconsidered up-to-date on their in fluenza vaccination if their EHR indicated administration of the vaccinewithin 1 year of their earliest con rmed diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, hospital encounters and in- tensive care unit (ICU) stays associated with a con- rmed diagnosis of COVID-19-were recorded for all patients in the cohort. Comorbidities that were foundto be prevalent among hospitalized COVID-19patients were recorded as well. 2In total, 2005 COVID-19 patients were included in our cohort. Unadjusted logistic regression models were used to compare the odds of COVID-19-related hospitaliza-tion or ICU admission between patients with up-to- date in fluenza vaccination and those without. Logistic regression analyses were subsequently adjusted for the potential confounders of gender, race/ethnicity, age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), obesity, coronary artery disease, and heart failure in a forced inclusion model. 2All analyses were conducted in R 3.6.3.Results Table 1 includes the baseline characteristics of the cohort. Of the 2005 patients included in our cohort, 214 (10.7%) patients were considered up-to-date on the in fluenza vaccine. This subpopulation of our cohort was found to have fewer males but had no difference in ethnic breakdown. The vaccinated group overall also had fewer comorbidities. Hospitalization and ICU admission were used as surrogate markers for moderate and severe COVID-19 disease. Our analysis indicates that individuals,who had not received the in fluenza vaccination in the last year, who tested positive for COVID-19 had 2.84 (95% con dence interval [CI], 2.03-4.07) higher odds of being hospitalized when compared with patients who were vaccinated (Table 2). Similarly, the unadjusted odds of ICU admission in unvacci- nated, COVID-19 positive individuals were 5.64(95% CI, 2.11-23.01) when compared with Table 1.

Protected by http://www.jabfm.org/ J Am Board Fam Med: first published as 10.3122/jabfm.2021.S1.200528 on 23 February 2021. Downloaded from vaccinated COVID-19 patients. This treatment effect was maintained for both hospital admission and ICU admission when adjusted for age, ethnicity, and medical comorbidities (Table 2). Discussion Our data strongly suggests that COVID-19 positivepatients who are not up-to-date on the in fluenza vacci- nation have higher odds of hospitalization. A review ofboth peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed literatureon the association between in fluenza vaccination and influenza-associated COVID-19 morbidity and mor- tality found no evidence that would suggest clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients with in fluenza coinfection differ from those without coinfection. 9 Thus, our results, which are not focused on in fluenza coinfection, are the rst to point to a potential protec- tive effect of in fluenza vaccination for hospitalization in individuals with COVID-19. The implications of these ndings are substan- tial, particularly for family medicine. With limited strategies available to effectively decrease the sever- ity of outcomes among COVID-19 patients, in flu- enza vaccination has several attractive qualities. Influenza vaccination is inexpensive, noninvasive, and well accepted in the population. Further, themechanisms for distribution in the population are well established. The role of the family physician in the prevention of COVID-19 outcomes with thisstrategy is particularly important. It is possible to speculate that the individuals who getflu shots are healthier because of a healthier life- style. Everyone in the study was COVID-19 positiveso a healthier lifestyle and fewer comorbidities may correlate with in fluenza vaccines and less severe out- comes. However, the adjusted analyses controlled forthe relevant comorbidities related to COVID sever- ity, and the effect was still quite strong. That said, wecontrolled only for comorbidities previously shown to be related to COVID-19 infection severity. There may be other variables that we are unaware of that may play a role in obtaining infl uenza vaccines and COVID-19 infection severity that could be worthyof future investigations. There are several limitations to our study. This study is a single-centered study, which makes its generalizability to the national population unclear. In addition, though in fluenza vaccination status was recorded in the EHR, this is not the standard for assessing vaccination coverage. 10There may be some misclassi cation of vaccinated individuals into the unvaccinated group. However, since that would likely dilute our treatment effect, the strength of the association is then particularly striking. As stated previously, there is no clear mechanism by which the in fluenza vaccination might be protect- ing against COVID-19 infection severity. As dis-cussed above, there is some evidence of cross- reactivity of antibodies from low-pathogenic corona- virus with COVID-19, 5but there is no evidence of cross-reactivity of in fluenza induced antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2. A literature search provides 2 the-ories that might explain our results. The rst is that an adjuvant within the flu vaccine is triggering a heightened immune response which may provide protective effects against COVID-19. We know that certain in fluenza vaccinations contain MF59, an immunogenicity of the in fluenza vaccine. MF59 has been studied in SARS-CoV vac- cines and shown to help stimulate an immune response. 11Another intriguing theory is that the influenza vaccine could be affecting NK (natural killer cell) cytotoxicity levels. Though the exact role of NK cells in ghting a viral infection is still unclear, there have been increasing studies showing some roleof NK cells in ghting virally infected cells. SARS- CoV-2 has been shown to dramatically lower NK cell activity in moderate to severe diseased patients. 12 Influenza vaccination and infection have been shown to increase NK cell activity.13Patients who have been vaccinated may have a more \"primed \"pool of NK cells and thus be able to suppress a COVID-19 infection more ef ciently. We believe that these preliminary ndings are signicant but require further study. When consid- ering its widespread availability and safety pro le, itTable 2.
