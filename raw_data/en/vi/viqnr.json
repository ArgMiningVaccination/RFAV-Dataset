It combines the fellow's own educational goals with those required during the Sports Medicine Fellowship . The ILP serves as a blueprint for the fellow's focus of study and to be used as a referen ce for evaluation by the fellow, faculty members and the Program Director . All learning goals will be listed; however, time restrictions will not allow the attainment of all goals listed on the ILP. A well thought out ILP will contain: 1. Statement of the fe llow's personal learning goals . Specific goals must be articulated, although not all goals may be met. 2. Plan for achieving several learning goals, which will include specific information on how the fellow will achieve each goal. 3. Measure of success in achiev ing each goal and will be documented in New Innovations under procedures as well as in the fellow self -assessment. The fellow must create his/her ILP at the beginning of the Sports Medicine Fellow ship (by the end of August) . The fellow needs to negotiate his/her ILP with: The Program Director at the beginning of the Sports Medicine Fellowship (before the end of August). The fellow will present the ILP during the bi -annual meeting with the director to assess progress, address weaknesses identified during the evaluation session, and make new or revise old goals for the last six months of the fellowship . The fellow will be required to submit copies of his/her ILPs with other required documentation in order to graduate. Please note - the ILP is simply a suggestion for documenting the attainment of the ACGME Competencies. If there is another method by which the Fellow would like to document his/her experience, then that method should be used . However, it must be in hard copy or electronic form so that it may be placed into the Fellow's permanent record.

UNM Family & Community Medicine Sports Medicine Fellowship Handbook Revised July 2013 Page 31 of 40 Duty Hours Duty hours are defined as all clinical and academic activities related to the program; i.e., patient care (both inpatient and outpatient), administrative dut ies relative to patient care, the provision for transfer of patient care; time spent in -house during call activities, and scheduled activities, such as conferences. Duty hours do not include reading and preparation time spent away from the duty site. Duty hours must be limited to 80 hours per week, averaged over a four -week period, no resident works more than 30 hours at one time , inclusive of all in -house call activities. Personal Responsibility for Patient Safety and Quality Assurance The program ensures a culture of professionalism that supports patient safety improvement protocols and quality assurance through personal responsibility. Fellows must demonstrate an understanding and acceptance of their personal role in the follo wing: assurance of the safet y and welfare of patients entrusted to their care; provision of patient - and family -centered care; assurance of their fitness for duty; management of their time before, during, and after clinical assignments; recognition of impairment, including illness an d fatigue, in themselves and in their peers; attention to lifelong learning; the monitoring of their patient care performance improvement indicators; and, honest and accurate reporting of duty hours, patient outcomes, and clinical experience data. All fellows must demonstrate responsiveness to patient needs that supersedes self -interest. Physicians must recognize that under certain circumstances, the best interests of the patient may be served by transitioning that patient's care to another qualif ied and rested provider. All faculty members are educated to recognize the signs of fatigue and sleep deprivation and in alertness management and fati gue mitigation processes. The University recognizes the potential impact of sleep deprivation and fatigue upon House Officers. Materials on sleep deprivation will be made available to House Officers during orientation and on the GME web site. Event Coverage Hours 1. Event coverage is defined as: A. Primary responsibility for team or event B. Attending event with appropriate medical supplies (i.e. Game bag) when indicated (high school football, UNM men's basketball road games ) If the fellow chooses to attend, a public sporting event on his/her day off, he/she will be considered a spectator/observer and not a fellow or team do ctor. They must not possess A & B (above) or they will be asked to leave the area. 2.

Leave Policies and Procedures The leave policy is jointly coordinated and administered through the Family Medicine Residency Program and the Graduate Medical Education Office, in compliance with the requirements of the American Boar d of Family Medicine. All requests and questions should be directed to the Program Director for the Sports Medicine F ellowship . General Policy For all anticipated absences, prior approval must be obtained from the Sports Medicine Program Director . There m ust be enough advance notice for the fellow's expected duties to be covered . The fellow's continuity clinic site must also be given the appropriate advanced notice of the planned absence. These arrangements are formalized through the Sports Medicine F ellow ship and must be presented in writing to the Program Director. The use of any leave may require make -up time for the purpose of Board eligibility, which is determined by the specific policy for each Board specialty and should be discussed with each indi vidual Program Director. House Officer s remain responsible for meeting the applicable time and other requirement of his/her program. UNM Family & Community Medicine Sports Medicine Fellowship Handbook Revised July 2013 Page 33 of 40 Annual Leave Annual leave provides the House Officer with time for rest and restoration for an extended period in order t o return to Residency with renewed vitality. This is beneficial for patient safety and House Officer's well-being. All House Officer s will receive 21 days of annual leave, which will be based on a five -day workweek consisting of 15- week days and 6 weekend days during the academic year. Annual leave, which is unused, will not be carried forward to the new training year. No lump sum payment will be made for unused leave upon termination. Annual leave must be requested in writing through the home Department o n approved leave request forms in accordance with the home program's established procedure . No annual leave will be scheduled and paid during the week at the beginning of the contract. Blocks of seven days are encouraged for House Officer s to have a period of adequate rest. No rotations will be off limits to vacation and Programs need to be aware they must provide appropriate coverage to allow this. House Officer s who have difficulties scheduling annual leave on a rotation should contact his/her Program Director for assistance. The GME Office can be an additional resource. House Officer s have the responsibility to schedule leave in a timely manner. The later the request the more difficult it may be for it to be granted. Normal requests should receive notific ation of confirmation or denial within 10 days of initial request from the Sports Medicine Program Coordinator . Annual leave for contract periods of less than a full academic year will be calculated on a pro rata basis. Program Directors Policy on Annual Leave for House Officer s Program Directors should grant House Officer s vacation in proportion to the number of House Officer s that are received on that service. For example, if you have one House Officer per month for one year, you would have to grant 21 days of annual leave on your service. No rotation is off limits to vacation. Requests for vacation on services other than the House Officer 's home service should be received a minimum of sixty days in advance of the requested annual leave. Requests without the sixty- day notice will be at the discretion of the service on which vacation is requested. Each program may have its own policies on the timetable for requesting vacation. Program Coordinators should communicate these timetables to off service coordinat ors whose House Officer s may rotate on his/her service. The request for vacation would be initiated with the Program Coordinator in the home service. The home Program Coordinator would verify the amount of annual leave remaining for that House Officer and obtain the proper signature and permission of the Program Director. The Sports Medicine Program Coordinator would communicate the vacation request by e -mail to the off service Program Coordinator. The communication cycle, discussion, and definitive approv al or denial of the request should be concluded within ten days of the initial e -mail communication of the request. Approval or denial of the request should be communicated by e - mail to the initiating Sports Medicine Program Coordinator . Steps for R equesti ng Annual Leave from Off -Service Rotations 1. The House Officer initiates the vacation request to the Sports Medicine Program Coordinator . 2. Sports Medicine Program Coordinator verifies remaining annual leave and obtains any required signatures or permissions for the home service. 3. At least 60 days prior to the date of the requested annual leave, the House Officer s Sports Medicine Program Coordinator will e -mail the annual leave request to the off service Program Coordinator, including name of House Officer , rotation dates, and requested leave. 4. The off service Program Coordinator will e -mail the Sports Medicine Program Coordinator a definitive approval or denial of the request within 10 days of the initial e -mail request. 5. The Sports Medicine Program Coordinator will notify the House Officer of his/her approved leave. Bereavement Leave House Officer s are granted three paid days per contract year for bereavement leave for immediate family members. House Officer s do not have the option of carrying unused leave fr om one contract year to another. Due to extenuating circumstances such as distance to be traveled, settling of the estate, the House Officer , upon request to the House Officer 's Program Director, shall be able to use annual leave, if available, to extend b ereavement leave beyond three (3) days or may be granted a leave of absence without pay. Catastrophic Leave A catastrophic illness and/or injury is defined as a medical or psychological event experienced by an employee, or an employee's dependent (spouse, domestic partner, or child), which is likely to require the House Officer to be absent from training for a prolonged period of time. Catastrophic leave is to support those unusual or catastrophic illnesses or injuries that leave the House Officer without salary between the duration of his/her paid sick and annual leave and the qualifying period of the long -term disability coverage (90 days). House Officer s do not have the option of carrying unused sick and annual leave from one contract year to another. Catastrophic leave must be requested in writing, through the House Officer 's Program Director to the Associate UNM Family & Community Medicine Sports Medicine Fellowship Handbook Revised July 2013 Page 34 of 40 Dean for Graduate Medical Education. The Associate Dean for GME approves such leave. A request for catastrophic leave may require an attending phys ician statement. It is to be used only after the House Officer has exhausted all available sick leave and a minimum of 15 days of annual leave. Catastrophic leave cannot exceed sixty (60) days. Catastro phic leave is available as a one- time event per durat ion of training. Any additional leave falls into the category of unpaid leave of absence. Make up time for purposes of board eligibility is determined by the specific policy of each specialty board and should be negotiated with the Program Director. Educat ional Leave Educational activities such as presenting papers, taking state and national examinations, or attending educational seminars may be allowed, with pay, with the advance approval of the Department Chairman, Program Director and the Chief of Service. GME recommends five days of Educational Leave per year. House Officer s do not have the option of carrying unused leave from one contract year to another. Holidays House Officer s shall be entitled to seven holidays off per year with pay. The following ho lidays are considered holidays with pay: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve. Holidays falling on a Saturday shall be observed on the preceding Friday. Holidays falling on a Sunday s hall be observed on the following Monday. House Officer s who are required to perform duty, or to be on -call, on a holiday shall be granted either alternate time off commensurate with the amount of time worked up to a maximum of eight (8) hours, or time -and-a-half pay up to a maximum of eight (8) hours for the time worked. The House Officer 's Program Director shall approve all requests for alternate time off or additional pay, and determine which option is granted. The Program Director shall not unreasonabl y deny the House Officer's preferred option. In the event the House Officer is granted time off, the time off must be taken within the House Officer 's training period and need not be granted in the same academic year in which the holiday falls. The altern ative leave arrangement may not be compounded. For example, a House Officer whose shift requires them to work on both Thanksgiving and the day after Thanksgiving will receive eight (8) hours of alternative leave or additional pay, not sixteen (16) hours. Since House Officer s may participate in training at multiple institutions, The Office of Graduate Medical Education strongly encourages alternative leave arrangements to be granted by Program Directors in the same rotation in which it occurs. It is permiss ible for alternative holiday leave to occur prior to the holiday if it is within the same rotation period. Leave of Absence - Without Pay The Program Director and the Chief of Service may grant leaves of absence, at his/her discretion, for periods of short duration. Time for such activities as locum tenens, paid consultation, personal courtroom appearances or personal business must be taken as leave without pay or annual leave. In such instances, House Officer s would be responsible for paying the full cost of his/her health, vision, and dental premiums. Insurance premiums are charged at full institutional cost to those working fewer than fifteen calendar days per month. Leave of absence without pay may, at the discretion of the Program Director, be extended up to a maximum of three months. Make up time for purposes of board eligibility is determined by the specific policy of each specialty board. Contact your Program Director for specific requirements for your specialty. House Officer s whose leave of absence extends beyond twelve months will be required to reapply for admission to his/her UNM residency or t he fellowship program should they wish to resume his/her GME training at UNM. Maternity/Paternity/Family Leave UNM Graduate Medical Education programs recognize the legitimacy of integrating childbearing and adoption into the years of graduate medical training. Return to work after pregnancy and pregnancy- related conditions is to be determined by the House Officer 's personal physician. Paid time off will no t exceed the total of 21 days of sick leave plus available annual leave. Leave of absence without pay may be extended to bring time off (the sum of paid and unpaid leave) up to a maximum of four months. The Office of Graduate Medical Education pays a port ion of the health insurance premium as a benefit during this approved Family Leave. Make up time for purposes of board eligibility is determined by the specific policy of each specialty board and should be negotiated with the Program Director. Military Lea ve Paid military leave shall be granted upon presentation of official orders at a rate of three (3) weeks per academic year, con sisting of fifteen (15) week days and six (6) weekend days per . Military leave is defined as leave for service into the United S tates Army, UNM Family & Community Medicine Sports Medicine Fellowship Handbook Revised July 2013 Page 35 of 40 Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Guard, Air National Guard, or reserve component thereof . In the event a House Officer is called to active duty by the military as defined above, the House Officer 's position within his or her training program shall be held until the House Officer can return to work duty at UNM HSC. Professional Leave Professional leave is available to House Officer s for the purpose of interviewing for employment, residency, or t he fellowship . House Officer s are allowed up to five days of such leave during the course of a residency or t he fellowship program. Leave for such purposes beyond the five days must be taken as annual leave or leave without compensation. No payment will be made for unused time. Sick Leav e All House Officer s receive twenty one days of paid sick leave (which will be based on a five day work week consisting of 15 week days and 6 weekend days) may be used during the contract term for the purpose intended. Sick leave must be documented in writing through the Department on approved leave request forms. The sick leave policy is established in order to protect the House Officer from threats to his/her own health, for bona -fide medical conditions, and to prevent patient exposure. Absence from work to care for an ill or injured member of one's immediate family (spouse, domestic partner, children, parents, and grandparents ) may be charged to sick leave and should be done in advance of the leave if possible. A Doctor's note may be required at the discr etion of the Program Director. Unused sick leave may not be carried forward to the next training year nor will any payment be made for unused time. Sick leave for contract periods of less than a full academic year will be calculated on a pro rata basis. U se of sick leave may require make up time for purposes of Board eligibility, which is determined by the specific policy of each Board specialty and should be discuss with the Program Director. House Officer s diagnosed with or suspected of having the follo wing infectious diseases should return to work through Employee Occupational Health Services about the need for medical clearance before returning to work: acute viral conjunctivitis, acute diarrheal disease and Salmonella infection, acute hepatitis A, vaccine -preventable viral dise ases, pertussis, scabies, Group herpetic whitlow, varicella and shingles. Note: This list is not comprehensive. Certain diagnoses may preclude working with immune -compromised patients. H ouse Officer s should contact Infection Control at 272- 0131 or pager 951- 1067 with any questions. Special provisions may apply to House Officer s with acute or chronic Hepatitis B and HIV (see page HIV/Hepatitis C/Hepatitis B). The University reserves the right to request a physician statement of fitness to return to work. Discipline , Dismissal & Due Process If the performance of a House Officer (otherwise referred to as Sports Medicine Fellow) is believed to be unsatisfactory in domains that include, but no t limited to, clinical skill, medical knowledge, ethics, professionalism, attendance, or compliance with institutional policies or the law, the Program Director must notify the House Officer in writing of the specific areas of unsatisfactory performance. E xamples of ethical misconduct include, but are not limited to harassment, patient abandonment, abuse of prescribing privileges, and unlawful discrimination. If the performance of the House Officer is unsatisfactory, the House Officer may be placed on remed iation. Remediation is not an adverse action, and is not appealable or grievable. If the seriousness of the problem dictates immediate action, the Program Director may summarily suspend the House Officer s, pending notification of the Associate Dean for Graduate Medical Education, and full investigation of the issue. The House Officer will be placed on probation for a specified period of time. The Program Director will designate a period of probation during which the House Officer must correct the deficienci es or be dismissed. The probationary period together should not be less than 30 days in length nor should normally exceed six months. The Program Director will meet with the House Officer regularly (at least every three months) during this period to formal ly review progress. At the end of the probation period, the Program Director will review the House Officer 's progress and determine whether satisfactory improvement has been made. Feedback may be solicited from faculty and the House Officer 's peers. If imp rovement has been satisfactory, the House Officer may be continued on probation for a specific period of time not to exceed six months. If the House Officer 's performance again becomes unsatisfactory during this period, the House Officer may be dismissed w ithout an additional probation period even if the probation extended beyond a contract year. The Office of Graduate Medical Education m ust be notified by the Program Director before the dismissal process can begin.
