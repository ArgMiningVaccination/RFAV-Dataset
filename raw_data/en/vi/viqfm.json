Acupuncture is an effective treatment for acute or chronic pain. Pain can be very frustrating and debilitating for your body. Pain in the lower back, neck, and knee are particularly common. It is also used for a wide variety of conditions such as arthritis, post-operative pain, addiction, menopausal symptoms, and neurological as well as musculoskeletal disorders. Acupuncture is a great way to relieve pain from migraines and headaches. The intensity and duration of pain can be reduced significantly with regular acupuncture sessions. The World Health Organization (WHO) and National Institutes of Health (NHI) recognize acupuncture as an effective treatment for various health conditions including pain management. Acupuncture stimulates the body to reduce inflammation and calm unwanted immune responses. It allows your immune system to function properly. Your body is protected by the support of a strong and healthy immune system. This allows for faster recovery time from illness by utilizing the bodies natural defenses. Consistent acupuncture session can strengthen your immune system to prevent illness and promote an all around healthy lifestyle. If you have trouble sleeping, or are suffering from insomnia, acupuncture can increase sleep quality. Sleep is the time when your body is recovering and repairing itself. This is especially important when considering acupuncture in Las Vegas, a city where things are happening at all hours. Lack of sleep can stop your body from properly functioning. Ultimately, losing too much sleep can lead to pain, stress, and additional disorders. Lack of motivation or feelings of fatigue can be helped with acupuncture, which can restore your energy levels. The demands of everyday life can make you feel rundown and overwhelmed, acupuncture can provide your body with a boost of energy and stamina. This is achieved by stimulating the bodies energy pathways. We live in a fast-paced society and our modern lives create increased levels of stress and anxiety. With acupuncture treatments, patients report feeling calmer and happier with less symptoms related to stress. In addition to stress and anxiety, many Americans also suffer from mental disabilities including depression. Acupuncture may offer relief for depression by lifting your mood and sense of well-being. Mental and emotional stability is an important factor in the process of restoring health and balance in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Acupuncture has been successful at treating people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) along with other emotional disorders. Treatment offers an overall calming effect without the need for pharmaceutical drugs. Las Vegas Integrative Medicine proudly offers acupuncture.

Here are some more great reasons to give acupuncture a try: There are no side effects. Acupuncture treatments do not trigger other issues that have to be addressed at a later stage with more medications. Acupuncture is safe, gentle, and chemical-free. I encourage everyone to try it for themselves alongside conventional medical care. It's a personalized care treatment. Each session is designed just for you by a specialist to naturally correct imbalances in the body. Your personalized plan is based on your symptoms, gender, lifestyle, age, work life, nutritional choices, and other aspects of your life. It is highly individualized, patient-centered medicine. Acupuncture addresses the root cause of disease, not only the symptoms. By focusing on the cause of disease, we are able to restore balance to the body. It can reduce reliance on medications. You can take charge of your health by reducing sick days and endless cycle of doctors visits. Acupuncture can help in cancer care. It may help to decrease adverse effects of chemotherapy or radiation therapy such as pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, dry mouth, and fatigue. It can address Infertility and pregnancy issues. In conjunction with the guidance of OG/GYN, acupuncture is used to increase the chances of successful IVF. It is also used to provide support during pregnancy and to prepare the body for labor. If you suffer from digestive issues such as IBS, acupuncture can help to improve digestion. Also, it can help to restore appetite and regulate bowl movements. Respiratory problems such allergies, asthma, and common cold can be treated with acupuncture. With symptoms of seasonal allergy, acupuncture can stop the interference of runny nose and itchy eyes with daily life. If you have been suffering from pain or have been curious about this medicine, it is definitely worth your time to give acupuncture a try. I recommend starting with one or two treatments a week. Incorporate acupuncture to complement other medical treatments that you are currently undergoing. When you are ready to try acupuncture, be sure to choose a licensed practitioner.
