Boosters are also offered at 3 months to 5 months after the original series using the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine. If a person has had a Covid-19 infection they should wait for 3 months before accepting a booster vaccination. Moderna Bi-Valent Vaccination The Moderna Bi-Valent vaccine is now available and being made available by Alberta Health. This mRNA vaccine offers protection against the legacy Covid-19 virus as well as the current variant, Omicron BA.1. The Omicron variant is the most prevalent in North America at this time and although may produce less severe symptoms, is considered to be more easily transmitted from person to person. This new vaccine offers for the first time, protection that targets the Omicron variant as well as the original Covid-19 virus. This vaccine is only being offered as a booster for those who have completed the initial vaccination series (with either the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccine) as well as those who have received similar booster vaccinations. To be eligible for the Moderna Bi-Valent vaccination, a person must be 18 years and older, received their last Covid-19 vaccination no earlier than 5 months prior or if immune compromised, 3 months prior to receiving the Moderna Bi-Valent vaccination. If you've had a breakthrough Covid-19 infection you should wait 5 months before receiving the Moderna Bi-Valent vaccination.
