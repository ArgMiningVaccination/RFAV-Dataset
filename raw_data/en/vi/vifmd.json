Our team is very busy reviewing the comments and suggestions looking for good ideas that will help build a more effective program. By the way, as we review the comments that we've received, we're not really interested in the sheer number of comments by category. Rather, we're examining the quality and content of the suggestions with an eye to finding comments that will help to build a more effective, efficient, and practical medical marijuana program (as opposed to a recreational marijuana program). We're also looking at whether the comments fit within the statutory authority as outlined in the Initiative. Our next draft rule package is due January 31, which will kick off our next comment period. "}
