ELIANT has the support of 1 million citizens. Part I ELIANT calls for an EU legislative framework to provide the conditions for safeguarding and promoting activities based on Anthroposophy. The activities of applied Anthroposophy are focused on the individual citizen in Europe, strengthening his personal ability to act as an individual responsible for his cultural, social, and natural environment, as a conscious consumer and as person who takes care for his well-being: Biodynamic food and agricul-ture, Anthroposophic medical treatment and Waldorf-Steiner education all contribute to an active and healthy person and ultimately to the health of European society as such. ELIANT members consider their initiatives as making a valuable contribution to the cultural and economic diversity of Europe. They consider that European integration should not lead to a levelling down but rather promote differences in accordance with the motto \"United in diversity\" to the advantage of everybody in Europe. ELIANT's requests fit well with some of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy such as those related to \"Innovation Union\" ELIANT members are concerned about the fact that some of their activities in agriculture, nutrition and health care suffer from the fact that mainstream EU legislation does not sufficiently take into account the specific requirements of their approach. ELIANT regrets in particular that some of the achievements of applied Anthroposophy, for instance in medicine and health care, are only available in some Member States while they are not admitted in others. European citizens should have the advantage to enjoy their freedom of choice everywhere in the internal market. Other activities of ELIANT members, especially in education, propose strengthening cer - tain ongoing actions of the Union. ELIANT's main concerns and requests with regard to EU legislation and policies are:Agriculture and nutrition No artificial vitamin fortification for biodynamic and other organic baby food Assure the continued legal manufacture and use of biodynamic preparations Legal protection of biodynamic agriculture and organic farming against GMO contamination Hygiene legislation in the food chain must not lead to the abolition of SMEs in rural areas; introduction of the concept of salutogenesis in hygiene measures Secure voluntary (not mandatory) electronic identification (EID) in animal keeping and production Medicine and Health develop adequate legislative and regulatory frameworks to secure access to all Anth - roposophic Medicinal Products for human use (AMP) equally for citizens in all European Member statesELIANT - Memorandum 20115 implement fully the right of establishment and the free movement of services for Anth- roposophic Medicine (AM) professionals, integrate the appropriate patients' rights into measures relating to consumers' interests, especially in view of patients using AM, appropriately integrate the AM into measures related to the improvement of public health Education and lifelong learning improve educational outcomes by reassessing how certain childhood competences such as the development of imagination in free play are prerequisite to the develop - ment of competences later on in life, engage the motivation, thinking skills and creative action of young people through, for instance, the increased use of portfolio work and greater freedom of curricula, involve more actively independent educational stakeholders in the clusters devoted to educational themes Disabilities pay special attention to the situation of people with special needs, such as learning disabili-ties and complex dependency needs, within the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 Research Future R & D Programmes of the EU, in particular FP 8 should more substantially take into account the need for holistic research approaches to living processes Establish a technology platform \"Complementary and holistic research in life sciences\" Part II Part II of the Memorandum describes the \"Action ELIANT\" collecting 1 million signatures supporting the aims of its Charter. In particular the report shows that Action ELIANT comes close to the requirements of article 11.4 TEU and the new regulation on the citizens' initiative.1 This relates in particular to the minimum number of Member States and the minimum number of signatures per State. ELIANT has also paid particular attention to the verification of signatures. The one million ELIANT signatures of European citizens are an indication that, on the matters mentioned in Part I, legal acts of the Union are required for the purpose of imple - menting the Treaties adequately. All the subjects fall within the powers of the Commission under the Treaties either by submitting legislative proposals or encouraging cooperation between Member States. In this light ELIANT considers its initiative if not formally falling under Article 11\u00a74, at least as a step of great political value in the context of Article 11\u00a72 TEU. ELIANT therefore expects the Commission to reply adequately to the concerns expressed in this Memorandum.ELIANT - Memorandum 20116Table of contents Summary ................................................................................. 4 Part I: ELIANT's position and concerns with regard to EU policies and legislation 1.

General Context The NGO ELIANT is the alliance of ten European umbrella organisations for applied Anthroposophy, active in the fields of agriculture and nutrition, medi-cine and public health, Waldorf-Steiner education as well as curative education and social therapy. ELIANT advocates hu-manitarian and cultural aims and calls for European policies allowing each citizen to make choices for his or her individu-al way of life, mode of education and healthcare. These objectives have been supported by one million European citizens, de - monstrating broad agreement with the aims and goals laid down in the ELIANT Charter (see annex 3). 1.1 AnthroposophyThe considerations and requests of this Memorandum have a common deno - minator: they all concern EU legislative framework conditions safeguarding acti-vities based on applied Anthroposophy. Rudolf Steiner used the term Anthropo - sophy for his philosophical and spiritual teaching. Derived from the Greek the Part I ELIANT - Memorandum 20118term means literally: knowledge of the human being. The Anthroposophic view provides added value in the realms of scientific, cultural and economic life. The unfolding of individual capacities through committed involvement can be met with innovating ideas in civil society. One central feature of applied Anthropo - sophy is interdisciplinary exchange and complementarity. This is reflected in the fields of action covered by the ELIANT core members. The aim of this interactive reflection is to open up and to combine various sources of health and health care to the advantage of the individual and finally of society as a whole. Healthy nutrition and education as well as empowering individuals in order to activate self-healing processes are ne - cessary answers to the socio-economic questions of our times. In their multi-disci-plinary Europe-wide cooperation, the core members of ELIANT show that innovative exchange between the different fields of their activities has an amplifying effect. 1.2 Fundamental rights The ELIANT core members feel encou-raged and strengthened in their ende - avours by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFR), now part of the EU legal framework. This Charter clarifies that European policies must be based on human values and guarantee a perspective for individu-al development and choices. ELIANT's Charter corresponds to these European values. ELIANT points in particular to ar - ticles 1 and 3 (Dignity) 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 (Freedoms) 21, 22, 25 and 26 (Equality) as well as 32, 35, 37 and 38 (Solidarity) which are, in its view, of eminent impor - tance in this respect. In a pluralistic soci-ety, citizens have a right to an individual approach to life and individual choices. The CFR articles mentioned above, in particular in their systematic combination, provides a fundamental framework for these needs and rights. For instance, all of the following articles of CFR will contribute to securing the availabi-lity of medical treatment for a citizen wan-ting to make use of the Anthroposophic health system: Article 3 CFR (integrity of a person) and Art. 10 (freedom of thought and conscience) for the patient, Article 13 (freedom of sciences) for the professor who teaches the doctor, Articles 14 (right to education) and 15 (freedom to choose an occupation) for the doctor and Article 16 (freedom to conduct a business) for the pharmacist who produces the medicine. All partners in this cooperation could also rely on Articles 21 (non-discrimination) and 22 (cultural diversity). Guided by these articles, a more adequate legal framework must be developed in form of a new EU regulation for Anthroposophic Medicine. ELIANT acknowledges the task of pub - lic authorities to guarantee the safety General ContextELIANT - Memorandum 20119 of medicinal products and health care services. However, ELIANT considers that this task should be carried out in con-sistence with the principles laid down in Article 52 CFR (scope of guaranteed rights). This implies in particular that any limitation to those rights must genui-nely meet objectives of general interest, observe the principle of proportionality and must always respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. ELIANT states in this Memorandum that the principle of proportionality has insuffici-ently been taken into account in European legislation in matters impacting on the working field of applied Anthroposophy. ELIANT therefore sees a need for either mo - difying the relevant existing regulations or considering new legislation. ELIANT would like to discuss further with the EU Commis-sion and the other European Institutions whether a \"public hearing\" on some of these issues would be advisable. European politics in all its complexity follows a democratic procedure and therefore has the potential to provide choices. However, in reality the European agenda reveals a general concentration at growth-oriented economics, over-re - gulation and overprotection. Mainstream policies do not give sufficient space to holistic and complementary approaches, and by not taking into account their experiences and best practices on the different EU policy-fields. 1.3 Participatory democracyWith this Memorandum the NGO ELI-ANT wishes to contribute to a successful accomplishment of the EU's Europe 2020 strategy. ELIANT's engagement is a contribution formulated by the civil society sector in this policy formation process. The often cited term \"United in diversity\" needs to be taken seriously. The core members of ELIANT consider their initiatives as valuable contributions to the cultural pluralism in Europe in its widest sense. In this context, ELIANT cooperates with many other NGOs, struggling for a Euro - pean policy which puts the citizens at its centre. \"Re-thinking\" of policy approa-ches from several aspects is necessary in order to focus on a humanised world with competent and free citizens and on a sustainable development of European society and environment. In the collection of one million signatures of European citizens within the Action ELIANT (see www.eliant.eu), the ELIANT Alliance has anticipated the new level of involvement of European citizens and civil society in EU politics as now estab - lished in Article 11 TEU. With one million signatures, ELIANT can demonstrate the EU-wide concern of citizens for the issues of applied Anthroposophy. Because of pressing demands, ELIANT members de - cided not to delay their collection cam-paign until implementing regulations for ELIANT - Memorandum 201110a European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) accor - ding to Article 11\u00a74 were in force. Howe - ver, as Part II of this Memorandum shows, Action ELIANT comes very close to a real citizens' initiative as now defined in Article 11 \u00a7 4 and the implementing regulation. The initiative of ELIANT covering a num- ber of citizens\u00b4 demands for legal acts of the Union can be considered an unusual approach. However, several legal acts have to be changed or newly introduced in order to safeguard the possibility of choice as defined above. ELIANT believes that the EU Commission will accept its considerations, suggestions and demands in the context of the new relationship between EU institutions and the civil society. ELIANT urges the Commis-sion to facilitate an open and transparent dialogue with the ELIANT core members about their concerns and demands. As ELIANT\u00b4s approach is widely politically sup - ported, ELIANT believes that its concerns will be examined carefully by the Commis-sion and its various services and expects to receive a substantial response. 2. Agriculture and Nutrition 2.1 Overview: Biodynamic agriculture and Demeter food Demeter International is a registered as-sociation representing 4.400 farms with about 145.000 hectares of agricultural area in 43 countries worldwide. Demeter is the oldest trademark related to organic farming products and was founded in 1928. Demeter stands for biodynamical produced foods. Biodynamic cultivation of the soil was founded by Rudolf Steiner in 1924. Biodynamic agriculture exceeds the demands of EC-regulation 834/2007 on organic farming in several aspects. For example the conversion of farms from conventional to biodynamic farming prescribes the conversion of the comple - te farm (not only parts of it). Bought-in feedstuffs from conventional production are not permitted. Biodynamic agricul-ture already puts into practice the future-oriented concept of a cyclical production and economic system. That means that the farm is developed into a so-called \"farm individuality\" , a process entailing a continuous maturing, diversifying and differentiating. In addition the farmer is obliged to raise livestock. Dehorning cattle is prohibited, however. The inclu-sion of cosmic rhythms and the use of biodynamic preparations play an impor - tant role in biodynamic farming. Biody - namic preparations are plant and mineral substances which are produced with the aid of certain animal organ sheets. These special preparations are added in very low homoeopathic concentrations to the compost and sprayed on soil and plants. Biodynamic preparations improve soil fertility, stimulating plant growth and enhance ripening processes of the culti-vated crops. see www.demeter.netAgriculture and Nutrition ELIANT - Memorandum 2011112.2 Common Agricultural Policy [CAP ] and EU legislation versus biodynamic food and farming?CAP: The mainstream policy of the CAP has neglected the promotion of sustai-nable and environmental friendly agri-culture on a larger scale. Support was mainly given to agro-industrial farming. In November 2010 Demeter Internatio - nal has joined the Agricultural and Rural Convention (ARC), a broad alliance of European civil society organisations and networks. The ARC submitted a proposal to the Commission and other EU ins-titutions for a reform of the CAP on 16 November 2010. 2 Demeter International fully supports the proposed reforms of the ARC and is asking the Commission to take the necessary steps leading towards a \"greener\" CAP and European agricul-ture. EU legislation in the field of agriculture, food production and consumer protection:The biodynamic approach to enhance soil fertility, raise animals in the most na-tural way and produce and process food, while enhancing living processes, can lead to conflicts with current EU legisla-tion, for instance in the fields of nutrition and hygiene (see 2.2.1 and 2.2.2). It is necessary that EU legislation takes full and sufficient account of the unique na-ture of biodynamic cultivation and that it recognises Demeter products as the most outstanding outcome of organic farming. In some cases, current EU legislation is at odds with the principles of biodynamic farming. Thus ELIANT considers that a legal act of the Union is required in particular on the following matters: No artificial vitamin fortification for biodynamic/organic baby food Assure the continued legal manufac - ture and use of biodynamic prepara-tions Legal protection of biodynamic agri-culture and organic farming against GMO contamination Hygiene legislation in the food chain must not lead to the abolition of SME in rural areas; introduce the concept of salutogenesis in hygiene measures Voluntary (not mandatory) electronic identification (EID) in animal keeping and production 2.2.1 No artificial vitamin fortification for biodynamic and other organic baby food The Commission Directive 2006/125/EC on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children forces producers of organic and biodynamic baby food to add ar - tificial vitamin. This is due to an unne - cessary high limit value of 25 \u00b5g/100 kJ vitamin B1.Artificial vitamin fortification of pro - ducts originating from organic farming is unnecessary for the following reasons: Infants and young children in Europe do not show vitamin B1 deficiency ELIANT - Memorandum 201112 The Codex Alimentarius of the WHO requires only a vitamin B1 minimum content of 12.5 \u00b5g /100 kJ A fundamental civil right is violated: freedom of choice Consumers of organic food expect that bio-products are natural and without additives We urge the Commission to revise Directive 2006/125/EC and suggest the following amendments: 1. The present vitamin B1 limit value of 25 g/100 kJ of the directive is replaced by the lower, but completely sufficient value of 12.5 g/100 kJ that is required in the Codex Alimentarius.2. The directive is supplemented by a paragraph that bio-products (organic farming products according to EC- regulation 834/2007) are not subject to artificial vitamin fortification. 2.2.2 Assure the legal manufacture and use of biodynamic preparationsRegulation (EC) 1069/2009 establishes the use of animal by-products not in- tended for human consumption. It also covers the handling of animal organ material for manufacturing biodynamic preparations. 4 This is a first and impor - tant step to reach a legitimate regula-tion for the manufacture of biodynamic preparations. On the part of the Com-mission, the production for the manu-facture of biodynamic preparations is given as an option which has to be ap - proved by the authorities of the Member States. The national Demeter associations are currently in the process of obtaining the approval of the national authorities in the respective Member States for the legal manufacture and use of the biody - namic preparations. However, according to the TSE-Regulation 5 (EC) 999/2001, animal material of risk category 1 (for instance cattle intestine and the mesen-tery) is still banned for the manufacture of biodynamic preparations. If necessary, the Commission should support the application of national Demeter associations which have difficulties in obtaining approval for the legal manufacture of biodynamic preparations to be issued by their nati-onal authority.As a medium-term goal the Commissi-on should find a legal solution to allow biodynamic farms to use TSE risk ma-terial category 1 from their own cattle, if these animals are proven to be TSE-free (The veterinary authorities of Switzerland and Demeter Suisse have already developed such a concept and are practising it successfully.) 2.2.3 Legal protection of biodynamic agriculture and organic farming against GMO contaminationThe deliberate release of GMO into the environment, including through cultivation, is regulated by Directive Agriculture and Nutrition ELIANT - Memorandum 2011132001/18/EC. Use as or in food and feed is regulated by Regulation (EC) 1829/2003. The GMO legislation also includes Regulation (EC) 1830/2003 for traceability and labelling of GMO.Demeter International and all the other organic farming associations are deeply concerned that GMO cultivation in the EU will irreversibly contaminate organic fields and harm the environ-ment. The intended coexistence of GMO and non GMO cultivation is not working in practice. 1. GMO cultivation in the EU takes place against the will of the majority of European citizens and consumers. The Commission should establish a legisla-tion which strictly applies the polluter pays principle and guarantees zero GMO-contamination in organic and non-GMO fields. 2. If food of animal origin such as meat, milk and eggs was produced by feeding the animals with GMO feed, it must be declared as GMO food in EU legislation. Otherwise there is no transparency and freedom of choice for the consumer. 2.2.4 Hygiene legislation in the food chain must not lead to the abolition of SMEs in rural areasThe European food hygiene regulation (EC) 852/2004 that came into effect in 2006 allows for some flexibility in order to take into account different and diverse local processing structures. Furthermo - re the law is based on a risk-oriented approach, which means, that the primary responsibility for food safety rests with the participants in the food chain. How - ever a conflict exists between, on the one hand, the self-regulation of the food producers and, on the other, govern-mental control. Demeter International is concerned, that in some countries, the interpretations of the new regulations inadvertently favour government control, leading to undesirable structural chan-ges in the food processing sector in rural areas. 6 The Commission should verify that the Member States apply EU legislation sufficiently flexibly to ensure that SMEs in rural areas can continue to exist. 2.2.5 Introduce the concept of Saluto - genesis in hygiene measures Contrary to the model of pathogenesis health is not defined as a momentary state, but as an ongoing process. This ongoing process can be strengthened by precautionary measures. Concerning hygiene measures on farms and in food today we face the following problems:Whereas on farms the contamination could be significantly lowered, the food has still the same contamination level as before.ELIANT - Memorandum 201114The big, rather than the small farms have the biggest microbiological problems and, worse, the more centralised the pro - duction, the bigger the problem. There is for instance no \"zero\" solution (e g. for Salmonellae) possible, as other bacteria take its place.On the farms, it is not simply a choice of hygienic measurements or vaccination: vaccination is not without its problems.Organic farming leads to less contamina-tion than \"modern\" farming, particularly with regard to bacteria, which are less resistant.Resistance of bacteria is increasing: there are many more deaths from bacteria than through hygienic risks. Isolation does not provide a solution: if the farm gates are closed, no active immune stimulation is possible.In conclusion, hygiene problems cannot be solved with this strategy.Instead, a paradigm shift towards saluto - genetic principles is required. stop discrimination of smallholders (exclude them from costly HACCP) lift zero tolerance threshold for sal-monellae in the environment train official controllers in small-scale production include consumers into the risk strategy 2.2.6 Voluntary (not mandatory) elec - tronic identification (EID) in animal keeping and productionRegulation (EC) 21/2004 makes the indi-vidual electronic identification (EID) of sheep mandatory and is already in force. It means that an electronic chip is inser - ted into the stomach of the sheep. This is against the will and ethical belief of many organic animal keepers. At present the Commission is preparing a legislative proposal for the introduction of EID for bovines (cattle etc.) by modifying Regula-tion (EC) 1760/2000. The legal introduction of EID in all animal keeping should be on a voluntary basis only. No farmer should be forced to use EID for his animals against his will. 3. Medicine and Health 3.1 Overview: Anthroposophic Medicine, an integrative approachAnthroposophic Physicians combine both conventional and anthroposophic interventions to provide an individua-lized and personalized treatment re - gimen. In particular, Anthroposophic Medicine stimulates the patient\u00b4s capa-city for self-healing (\"salutogenesis\") and prevention.Anthroposophic physicians work in general practice as well as in all medical specialties including internal medicine, intensive care and accident & emergency Medicine and Health ELIANT - Memorandum 201115medicine, surgery, cardiology, practised in many multi-disciplinary settings such as thera-peutic centres or clinics where physicians and other health professionals with spe - cial training in Anthroposophic Medicine work together. Anthroposophic Medi-cine is also integrated into primary care settings, in hospitals (including university teaching hospitals) or in anthroposophic medical departments in conventional hospitals and in psychiatric hospitals. The rationale of Anthroposophic Medi-cine is based on a scientific system that integrates the anthroposophic view of the human being and nature with main-stream medical science. In this respect, Anthroposophic Medicine is not compa-rable to traditional medical systems such as homeopathy, TCM, Ayurveda. Supplementary to, or - if appropriate - instead of conventional pharmaco - therapy, therapeutic interventions may combine the use of anthroposophic medicinal products with anthroposophic therapies including art therapy, euryth-my therapy (a special movement thera-py), therapeutic speech, anthroposophic physiotherapy and rhythmical massage. These therapists practise within the sys-tem of Anthroposophic Medicine - usually in close collaboration with an anthroposophic physician. Please see www.medsektion-goetheanum.org. As an integrative medical system, Anthro - posophic Medicine is related to comple - mentary/alternative medicine (CAM). Anthroposophic medicinal products are based on substance preparations of mineral, botanical, or animal origins, as well as on chemically defined substances. They are either processed by homeopa-thic technologies (see European Phar - macopeia, German Pharmacopeia, Swiss Pharmacopeia) or by specific Anthropo - sophic technologies (see Swiss Pharma-copeia, Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex APC). During the 90 years of Anthroposophic Medicine's existence, more than 3000 different Anthroposophic medicinal pro - ducts have been used in clinical practice by several thousand physicians in Europe and worldwide. For further details please see www.ivaa.info. Patients who use Anthroposophic Medi- cine can join one of the 15 national pa-tients' organisations for Anthroposophic Medicine. These associations have joined forces on a European level in the Euro - pean Federation of Patients' Associations for Anthroposophic Medicine (EFPAM). The Federation (www.efpam.eu) is also a member of ELIANT. Pluralism in medicine should be a gui- ELIANT - Memorandum 201116ding principle of EU health policies. EU regulations should take account of the specific concerns of patients and indivi-duals, respecting both their autonomy and their free choice of treatments. Anthroposophic Medicine should be integrated into EU provisions for promo - ting public health and for enhancing the free circulation of medicinal products, health professionals and health services within the EU's internal market. To advance integration of the added value to European public policies that Anthroposophic Medicine can provide, and to reflect this in an adequate EU legal framework for medicinal pro - ducts, ELIANT considers that the Union should undertake actions in the fol-lowing areas: Development of an adapted proce - dure specifically facilitating mar - keting authorizations for all Anth-roposophic medicinal products in the context of the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use (Directive 2001/83/EC and Directive 2004/4/EC); this adap - ted procedure might also be subject of a separate legal framework for products of the traditional medical system 'Anthroposophic Medicine' This adopted procedure might also be subject of a separate legal frame - work for products of the traditional medical system 'Anthroposophic Medicine' , 7 Full implementation for Anthroposo - phic medical health professionals of the right of establishment (article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)), and the free circulation of services (article 56 TEFU), Appropriate integration of patients' rights, particularly as regards patients who use Anthroposophic Medicine, into measures based on Article 169 TFEU relating to consumers' interests, Appropriate integration of Anthro - posophic Medicine into measures, based on Article 168, relating to the improvement of public health. These considerations are explained in more detail below. 3.2 Availability of Anthroposophic Medi-cinal ProductsAnthroposophic medicinal products (AMP) have been on the market in EU member states under registration proce - dures that predate EU framework legislati-on for medicinal products for human use. Anthroposophic medicinal products are conceived, developed and produced in a so-called process-oriented way that reflects the interrelationship between the human being and the levels of minerals, plants and animals in nature. They are produced in accordance with modern standards of Good Manufac - turing Practice (GMP). Their quality is Medicine and Health ELIANT - Memorandum 201117controlled by the criteria and parameters of official pharmacopoeias (e.g. European Pharmacopoeia, German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia, French British Homeopathic - eia, Pharmacopoeia Helvetica and the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex). The complete spectrum of Anthroposo - phic medicinal products is registered in Germany and Switzerland, while only a limited range of the spectrum of Anthro - posophic medicinal products is currently legally on the market (registered, notified or other) in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden and the UK. The EU Community Code relating to medicinal products for human use (Direc - tive 2001/83/EC and Directive 2004/24/EC) does not recognize Anthroposophic medicinal products in the same way as, for example, it recognizes homeopa-thic medicinal products and traditional herbal medicinal products under specially adapted registration procedures. This has far-reaching consequences for marketing authorization and registration of Anthropo - sophic medicinal products within the EU. Only those anthroposophic medicinal products manufactured according to homoeopathic technology are covered by the existing EU legislation. Until now, the implementation of the regulation for medicinal products produced according to the homeopathic technologies is still not satisfactory. All other Anthroposo -phic medicinal products are considered as ordinary medicines in application procedures for marketing authorisation. The procedures foreseen in the EU Community Code relating to medici-nal products for human use (Directive 2001/83/EC and Directive 2004/24/EC) are not appropriate for medicinal pro - ducts issued from - used for the indivi-dual centred practice within - a specific medical system such as Anthroposophic Medicine, and are therefore not adequa-tely applicable. The situation for marketing of Anthropo - sophic medicinal products inside the EU is, as for every pharmaceutical product in the EU, complicated by the fact that the principle of the EU Single Market is still not extended to the markets for all medicinal products such as homoeopa-thic medicinal products (mutual recog-nition shown not to be feasible; specific national regulation only as an option for other homoeopathic medicines), or to Anthroposophic medicinal products. Therefore, each pharmaceutical product has to be registered one at a time in each of the 27 Member States in order to be available inside the EU. This is a dispro - portionate high burden and will prevent free circulation and free choice for the EU patients. Furthermore, the fact that there is no Sin- gle Market for pharmaceutical products ELIANT - Memorandum 201118in the EU creates a difficult situation for a highly individualized medical system such as Anthroposophic Medicine, which requires small quantities of a single product, but a large spectrum of different substances and combinations thereof to be available in each Member State. The registration and authorisation procedu-res are disproportionate to the specific characteristics and the positive overall sa-fety profile of the products; The required manpower and resources for documen-tation and registration under the current EU legal framework outweighs the actual economic turnover from these medicinal products. Both problems - the lack of adequate re - gistration procedures for Anthroposophic medicinal products in the Community Code relating to medicinal products for human use (Directive 2001/83/EC and Directive 2004/24/EC) and the obstacles the lack of a Single Market causes for pharmaceutical products in the EU - need to be addressed and resolved by EU pharmaceutical policy. ELIANT appreciates that the EU Com- mission has noted these problems to some extent, as expressed in its report COM(2008) 584, 8 and elsewhere (Phar - maceutical Committee 2009, PHARM 572). However, ELIANT considers it necessary for the EU Commission to present a Communication concerning the problems of Anthroposophic Me -dicine and other \"traditional therapies\" in the next two years in order to start a political discussion in the EU institutions for an adequate legal regulation of these therapies. Together with the other Anth-roposophic medical stakeholders, ELIANT offers its input to explore the suitability of an alternative, adequate and indepen-dent legal framework for Anthroposophic Medicine on the bases of a scientifically based \"system approach\" for the medical system of Anthroposophic Medicine that has a long tradition in Europe. 1. ELIANT calls for EU policies under the EU Community Code relating to medi-cinal products for human use (Directive 2001/83/EC and Directive 2004/24/EC) to develop adequate regulation for Anthroposophic medicinal products, taking account of the fact that anthro - posophic medicinal products belong to a therapeutic system by: recognizing Anthroposophic medi-cinal products as a distinct entity, with adequate regard to their specific definition (www.escamp.org/anthroposophic-medicinal-products.html) stipulating procedures for their adequate authorization and/or registration as part of the medical system of Anthroposophic Medici-ne, taking into account their high level of safety during long establis-hed use, and the features of Anth-roposophic medicinal products as Medicine and Health ELIANT - Memorandum 201119low-profit products (small single- product turnover with a large spec-trum of different constituents) presenting a Communication about the problems of Anthropos-phic Medicine and other \"traditi-onal therapies\" to start a political discussion in the EU institutions for an adequate legal regulation of these therapies 2. Together with the other Anthropo - sophic medical stakeholders concer-ned ELIANT offers the EU Commission and EU institutions its close coopera-tion in developing an adequate legal and regulatory framework for Anthro - posophic Medicine and Anthroposo - phic medicinal products. In due course the Anthroposophic medical stakehol-ders will provide a scientifically based \"system approach\" model for Anthro - posophic Medicine. 3.3 Right of establishment and freedom to provide services for Anthroposophic doctors and other health professionals practising within the system of Anthro - posophic Medicine.Due to national responsibility for health systems, recognition of Anthroposophic Medicine is subject to great variations in EU Member States. The level of recogni-tion extends from statutory integration of the therapeutic system into national health systems (Germany and Switzer - land) to special exemption allowing Anthroposophic Medicine to be practised only in the context of a particular clinic - as in Sweden. 9 In Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UK, Anthroposophic medicinal products are mentioned to varying degrees in natio - nal pharmaceutical laws, in particular in connection with simplified registration procedures for homeopathic medicinal products. Variations in degrees of official recogniti- on impact on the right of qualified doc - tors to practise Anthroposophic Medicine in different EU Member States. The conditions for practising Anthropo - sophic Medicine are: a conventional aca-demic medical training with university degree, and national licence to practise as physician. After satisfactory fulfilment of the criteria for training and qualifying in Anthroposophic Medicine, a \"specially trained anthroposophic doctor\" diploma is issued by national anthroposophic medical associations, or by the Medical Section at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland. In Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Spain and Switzerland these diplomas are recognized by national professional bodies (medical associations, chambers or councils) since governments have delegated the tasks of authorization, registration and supervision of physicians ELIANT - Memorandum 201120to national medical associations. In Italy, Anthroposophic Medicine is recognized through statutory regulation by local medical bodies (associations/ chambers/ councils) in Bologna, Terni and Palermo. In Belgium, Finland, France, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Sweden and the UK, \"specially trained anthropo - sophic doctor\" diplomas are not recog-nized by national medical bodies. The professional medical codex in some of these countries may regard the practice of Anthroposophic Medicine by spe - cially trained anthroposophic doctors as unethical or even illegal (as in Sweden), or there may be legal obstacles to its practice. These divergences between national health systems as regards access to specially trained anthroposophic doctors and other health professionals practi-sing within the Anthroposophic medical system cause difficulties for such health professionals who, if they wish to work in a Member State of their choice, seek to assert their right of establishment (Artic - le 49 TFEU), or their freedom to provide services (Article 56 TFEU). In ELIANT's view, the existing seconda- ry law to implement these two basic provisions for free circulation within the internal market, does not sufficiently take account of the distinctive features of anthroposophic health professionals. To some extent Directive 2005/36/EC (re - cognition of professional qualifications) tackles this issue, since Anthroposophic doctors and other health professionals fulfil the general requirements mentioned in the Directive for these professions (see its Annexes II and V). However, this directive does not encompass the speci-fic qualifications and diplomas available through Anthroposophic Medicine. ELIANT therefore suggests that EU insti-tutions make use of their powers under Article 53 TFEU to achieve a more subs-tantial harmonization of national legis-lation in each country as regards access to health professions, in accordance with the principle of plurality that should gua-rantee access to anthroposophic medical health professionals. Article 15 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights (Freedom to choose an occupati-on and right to engage in work) requires the EU to engage in implementing the objectives of the treaties in relation to those areas which have not yet been adequately covered. New EU activity on this issue is therefore called for. ELIANT highlights the fact that estab - lishment of the right of an academically trained and licensed physician with spe - cial training in Anthroposophic Medicine to practise Anthroposophic Medicine provides added value to healthcare in Europe, with no additional impact on Medicine and Health ELIANT - Memorandum 201121safety for the patients or health systems concerned. ELIANT expects EU policies to enga-ge in a new attempt to establish the freedom of any academically trained and licensed physician with special training in Anthroposophic Medicine, and of any Anthroposophic therapist providing services within the medical system of Anthroposophic Medicine, to provide services in line with best practice requirements. The professional organizations that are members of ELIANT, in particular IVAA and ECCE, will approach the Commission in relation to this matter. They will consider using the provision of Directive 2005/36/EC to make a re - asoned request for specific provisions for the recognition of qualifications based on harmonization of minimum training conditions. 3.4 Patients' rights European diversity in lifestyles and nutritional habits is also reflected in the different approaches of European citizens to promoting their health and combating illnesses. Alongside conventional medi-cine, European citizens seek and use a wide variety of complementary and alter - native medicines and therapy methods, in line with the traditions of their national health systems. Patients insist increasin-gly on their right to actively participate in choosing a therapy. Moreover, pati-ents\u00b4 satisfaction and the quality of their processes of recovery are increasingly regarded as essential factors for health-care providers, sometimes as important as improvement in clinical health measu-res. An ever more elderly population with high incidence of chronic disease means that questions relating to quality of life and managing illness will grow even more important. The European Union's Charter of Funda- mental Rights opens a new chapter for patients' rights. Article 35 of this Charter accords to every human being the right of access to medical treatment, and aims to ensure a \"high level of human health protection\" . The European Charter of Patients' Rights, formulated by the Active Citizenship Network, has identified fourteen patients' rights necessary for providing a high level of human health protection and assuring a high quality of provision available in Europe in each National Health Service. These include: the right of access, the right to informa-tion, the right to consent, the right to freely choose from different therapies and health providers, the right to privacy and confidentiality, the right to the ob - servance of quality standards, the right to safety, and the right to a second opinion. Some European institutions have ex - pressly recognized these patients' rights. The European Economic and Social ELIANT - Memorandum 201122Committee's Opinion on Patients' Rights (2008/C 10/18) of September 2007, ack - nowledged that patients' rights are based on and closely related to human rights, and have the aim of making patients independent. In the resolution on non-conventional medicine of May 1997, the European Parliament stated that it is im-portant to ensure that patients have the broadest possible choice of treatment, which includes the choice of non-con-ventional medicine (CAM). Rulings by the European Court of Justice have proven on a number of occasions that patients have the right to enforce their access to CAM or CAM-related medicinal products. Most EU Member States have issued statements about the importance of pati-ents' healthcare views and needs. But the reality in the Union looks different where patients' rights to inclusion of CAM are concerned. The right of patients to seek complementary and alternative health-care is not guaranteed, and even the decisions of the European Court of Justice have not motivated Member States to consider access to CAM to be a patient's right. Anthroposophic Medicine suffers from this situation as well, since about 10 percent of the large number of patients using CAM therapies complementary to, or instead of conventional medicine, use this therapy's services and products. This is not and cannot remain the way forward in dealing with matters of health and well-being in the Union. Throughout Europe, patients require a responsive health service which offers appropria-te treatment and therapy options that meet their needs and explicit demands. ELIANT considers that the EU should examine the situation of patients taking account of its powers under Article 169 TFEU. The objectives are clear: to promo - te the interests of consumers and to en- sure a high level of consumer protection, the Union shall, inter alia, help protect consumers' health interests. This is not just a question of safety and protection against potentially dange - rous side effects of medicaments, as has mainly been the case so far. It is much more, and in particular, a question of patients having free choice of therapies they trust in. This consideration is in line with the Consumer Policy Strategy 2007-2013 which the Commission adopted in 2007. This strategy aims in particular to incre - ase consumer confidence in the internal market and to ensure that consumers' concerns are taken into account. ELIANT urges the Commission to inclu- de in its Consumer Policy Strategy 2007 -2013 the interests of patients as consu- mers, in particular as regards promoting plurality and free choice of medical treatment.Medicine and Health ELIANT - Memorandum 2011233.5 Anthroposophic Medicine and public healthAll those involved in the field of Anthro - posophic Medicine - doctors, therapists, pharmacists and manufacturers of Anth-roposophic medical products, together with patients - will have to act together in order to utilize the added value of Anthroposophic Medicine within the EU. To ensure this happens across internal borders between EU Member States, a better and more coherent approach to public health policies by the Union and by each Member State is essential. In order to coordinate and to comple - ment the measures referred to in part 4.2 to 4.4, actions taken under Article 168 TFEU are necessary. As \u00a7 1 of this Article states, \"A high level of human health pro - tection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. \" ELIANT advocates an ongoing and gra- dually increasing commitment by all EU institutions to a strong European public health policy that is open to a variety of medical approaches including Anthropo - sophic Medicine in particular. In complementing, supporting and coordinating harmonization of health po - licies at the European level and between Member States, EU public health policy strategy has to include the different, health-promotion oriented medical the - rapies and approaches which are offered by CAM in general, and Anthroposophic Medicine in particular. The rich diversity of medical culture in Europe is an asset and an added value to the health systems in the Union. These considerations follow the key objectives of the EC Health Strategy 2008 - 2013 as laid down in the Commission's 2007 White Paper \"Together for Health\" . ELIANT urges the Commission to found its considerations on the principle of plurality, and to take actions aimed at further implementation of this strategy. ELIANT also strongly advocates that respect for patient autonomy should be at the heart of all measures and efforts to improve EU public health policies, prevent physical or mental illness and safeguard a high level of human health protection in the Union. ELIANT demands, as a complement to consumer policy, that the individual patient's freedom to choose the form of medicine he believes may offer the best chance of curing his ailments and diseases be included as an objective in the further strategy of European Public Health Policy.ELIANT demands that acceptance and acknowledgement of the variety of me - dical approaches, including Anthroposo - phic Medicine in particular, be incorpo - rated into the guiding principle whereby EU institutions coordinate public health. ELIANT - Memorandum 201124In promoting this principle in healthcare systems and offering unbiased informa-tion about alternative medical approa-ches, the EU will provide added value for health in Europe, promoting health equality by facilitating equal access to high-quality healthcare services in all EU Member States. ELIANT stresses the importance of a patient-centred public health system.Strengthening patients' rights should be one of the priorities for optimizing European and national health systems. 4. Education and lifelong learning 4.1 OverviewThe European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education is one of the 10 European associations in ELIANT, re - presenting 700 schools in 23 European countries and many more kindergartens all over Europe, based on an educational ethos that seeks to provide children and youth with an unhurried environment in which they can mature to responsible citizens who are confident and capable of productively engaging with an ever-changing modern world in a creative and ethical manner. ECSWE has worked in the environment of the European educational space for the last fifteen years to raise the profile of childhood as a time when all children have a right to respect, care and nurturing that is in accord with an understanding of their developmental pathways and individual needs. ECSWE has formed alliances with other such groupings and pioneered pan-national cooperative practices. In the field of life long learning, ELIANT's ECI is concerned with improving educational outcomes by reassessing how certain childhood competences such as the develop - ment of imagination in free play are prerequisite to the development of competences later on in life (as re - vealed by the new learning sciences) engaging the motivation, thinking skills and creative action of young people through, for instance, the in-creased use of portfolio work and by developing new qualifications with a greater freedom of curricula for both teacher and learner more actively involving independent educational stakeholders in the clus-ters devoted to educational themes The specific measures mentioned above are elaborated as follows: 4. 2 Childhood Employers are increasingly seeking workers with the competence to adapt and to react with flexibility to changing situations. Beyond that, the spirit of ent - repreneurship and the ability to work in a team are increasingly sought after.Education and lifelong learning ELIANT - Memorandum 201125A major threat to the development of such qualities is an attack on the quality of childhood that is occurring in many areas within Europe today. At the pre-school le - vel, the capacity of free play and provision for its sustainability is disappearing. Free play is, however, the main competence of early childhood out of which the ability to adapt flexibly to changing situations and the capacity to work in a team evolves later on in life. Free fantasy play, which historically was naturally enacted by groups of children who played together, is being usurped by devices that enter - tain children with overabundant worlds of finished forms, leaving little to the active imagination of children. Children need protection. Children need ample time to progress through school and should not be unduly hurried and should not be expected to deal with stress for which they are not equipped. Children need environments sensitive to their na-tural joy of learning so they can naturally mature to adults who are confident and capable of productively engaging with an ever-changing modern world. Regarding school entry, empirical research finds \"robust and significant positive effects on educational attainment for pupils who enter school at seven instead of six years of age\" (Darmstadt University of Technology 2005 10) and that \"younger children in a school year are at a slightly greater psychiatric risk than older child-ren\" (British Medical Journal 2003 11). Educational outcomes are unlikely to improve until the key competences of childhood are properly understood and action is taken to ensure that these key competences are given a chance to unfold. Each segment of education (pre-school, primary, secondary, vocational and tertiary) needs to be reassessed with regard to how key competences develop and how certain childhood competences are prerequisite to the development of competences later on in life. An under - standing of favourable as well as adverse factors influencing key competences need to be deepened in order to take concerted action, requiring research, also on high-lighting the social and emotional contexts of learning, and a sharing of experience between the different educational sectors. We call upon the Commission to take action geared toward the protection of childhood in those areas where the Commission has such competence and to recommend to Member States to take appropriate actions on their own accord and to coordinate such actions in the Council of Ministers. 4.3 YouthIn the flagship initiative \"Youth on the move\" , the Europe 2020 Strategy inter alia calls upon Member States to \"enhance the openness and relevance of education systems by building national qualification ELIANT - Memorandum 201126frameworks and better gearing learning outcomes towards labour market needs\" . Beyond an obviously necessary periodic reassessment of vocational training pro - grammes against the needs of society, fun-damental aspects of a strategy for \"better gearing of learning outcomes\" have already been pointed to under \"Childhood\" above. Beyond building national qualification frameworks and relating the experience of schooling more closely to the workplace, the openness and relevance of education systems need to increase by building new and relevant qualifications as such. Decreasing the proportion of early school leavers to 10% by 2010 failed (and has now been reset for 2020) also because qualifi-cation systems continue to rely too heavily on centralised testing built on prescriptive curricula, generating much fear, failure and \"teaching to the test\" . New qualifications should develop an openness of curricula for both teacher and learner, largely repla-cing prescriptive rote learning by a diversity of teaching and learning pathways. Portfolio work is a practical methodology for engaging the motivation, thinking skills and creative action of young people. It helps to better document specific achie - vements and a wider range of learning outcomes, is best suited for the recognition of non-formal and informal learning and helps young people keep their appetite for and to take more ownership of their learning. When properly implemented, working with portfolio as a teaching and assessment technique can significantly contribute to decreasing the number of early school leavers. For portfolio to be - come a normal feature of national quali-fications, however, a change of culture is necessary. Working with portfolio needs to be made more accessible in educatio - nal systems, including clear and practical guidelines for teachers.The European Portfolio Certificate (EPC) folder and its standards and guidelines for teachers were recently developed in a Comenius project by Steiner Waldorf schools. It is open, however, to all who want to professionally work with portfolio as a teaching and assessment technique, independent of any particular pedagogical approach. We call upon the Commission to support a wide implementation and spread of the European Portfolio Certificate Folder and the standards upon which it rests (cf. www.epc-group.org ), as well as to support developing it further, creating wide-spread ownership wherever possi-ble (for example for students at the end of primary school as well as for adults engaged in the process of life long lear - ning). 4.4 Stakeholders participationWe call upon the Commission and Member States to more actively involve educational stakeholders, who have an independent status and are not part of Education and lifelong learning ELIANT - Memorandum 201127the state operated sector, in EU policy for - mation and dissemination of good practi- ce. Clusters established in the context of the Education and Training 2010 work programme have recently continued their work in more or less previously establis-hed configurations. Member States may nominate members from outside their ministries to participate but, in fact, rarely do. No stakeholders from independent schools have ever been nominated to par - ticipate in the work of the clusters thereby excluding a vast body of experience that could provide innovative, creative and sustainable methodologies. European organisations like the European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education would be pleased and willing to contribu-te to developing future educational policy in all relevant European cluster working groups. Independent schools that are run as non-profit making entities and as learning communities could take the lead in developing, testing and implementing educational innovation, as they tend to be more flexible and diverse than schools run by national governments. Furthermore, a stronger representation of minority group stakeholders is supported by citizens all over Europe and can serve as a key educational factor in promoting tolerance, equity and social cohesion. We call upon the Commission to more actively involve independent educatio - nal stakeholders in the clusters devoted to educational themes5. Disabilities The situation of people with special needs, such as learning disabilities and complex dependency needs, requires special atten-tion. ELIANT (and in particular one of its members, the \"European Co-operation in Anthroposophical Curative Education and Social Therapy\" - ECCE) represents many of these people, supported and guided by almost 500 professional organisations, their parents, family members, professio - nal staff members, teachers, trainers and therapists in all European countries. They ask urgently for appropriate measures to guarantee the professional support and guidance they need. The adoption on 15 November 2010 of the Commission's Communication on a European Disability Strategy 2010 - 2020 (COM (2010) 636 final), taking account of the UN Convention on the rights of People with Disabilities, is a very hopeful signal for these people. ELIANT urges the Commission to enhance in the frame - work of this strategy in particular the fol-lowing possibilities for disabled people: to move and live freely in the Euro - pean Union, to have a freedom of choice for an personal living environment, to eat food without artificial nutrients, to choose freely Anthroposophical medicines and therapies, prescribed by university educated and registered medical doctors, DisabilitiesELIANT - Memorandum 201128 for an education that is tailored to their needs according to the educatio - nal convictions of their parents and to contribute to society by handicraft and artistic activities. Those choices would make a strong con-tribution to sustainable inclusion in socie - ty for people with learning disabilities and complex dependency needs.The Commis-sion should take their position seriously, particularly regarding Articles 21 and 26 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and Articles 10 and 19 TFEU. Anthroposophical curative education and social therapy has proven its value for those people for almost 90 years, all over Europe. Every opportunity should be available to people with learning disa-bilities and complex dependency needs. They should be supported by action in the eight main areas of the new strat - egy, so that they may take advantage of appropriate professional guidance whenever needed. This would contribute to their experience of dignified behavi-our towards them and be compatible with their own human dignity, individual development and freedom of choice in a pluralist and cultural diverse society. Pay special attention to the situation of people with special needs, such as learning disabilities and complex de - pendency needs within the European disability Strategy 2010 - 20206. Research 6.1 OverviewThe latest Green Paper of the European Commission on research and innovati-on emphasises that the EU should use its natural resources more wisely. 12 The paper asked \"how EU-funding should best take account of the broad nature of innovation, including non-technological innovation, eco-innovation and social innovation?\" It also questioned \"how and what types of medium and small enterprises (SME) should be supported at the EU level? What kind of measures should be taken to decisively facilitate the participation of SMEs in new research and innovation programmes?\" 13 Finally, the Commission comes to the conclusion that \"in the long term, world-class excel-lence can only thrive in a system in which all researchers across the EU are provided with the means to develop into excel-lence and eventually compete for the top spots\" . 14 Up to now anthroposophic research has developed and financed its innovation and the resulting applied technology in the fields of biodynamic agriculture, An-throposophic Medicine, anthroposophic curative therapy and Steiner / Waldorf education almost exclusively by itself (i.e. without the support of EU funding). As applied anthroposophic research and its results can contribute highly to the abo - ve mentioned aims of the EU research and innovation programme, it seems mandatory that the Commission should DisabilitiesELIANT - Memorandum 201129Research integrate applied anthroposophic scienti- fic methods into its research areas.Applied anthroposophic research in the field of agriculture, medicine and (cura-tive) education is based on holistic and complementary research approaches. Applied Anthroposophy has developed a scientific method to study organisms in context providing knowledge about their properties and inner nature wit - hout destruction and isolation from their natural environments. Organisms can be explored beyond the molecular level 15 and the results can be applied both in organic agriculture and complementary medicine.Demeter International (as a member organisation of ELIANT) has organised a science policy conference in the Eu-ropean Parliament in 2009 with partici-pation of some representatives of the European Commission. Speakers pre - sented research visions for society and agriculture, for the need of a new science of the organisms, methodology in com-plementary medical research and in the area of food quality as well as participato - ry research in organic farming. These new scientific approaches should be included in the European research programmes for the benefit of nature and environ-ment, living organisms, public health and society. 16 We call upon the Commission to integrate the anthroposophic scienti-fic approach and its modern applied research methods into the 8th and fol-lowing research framework program- mes of the EU. A promising perspective for its realisation would be to establish a technology platform \"Complementa-ry and holistic research in life sciences\" . 6.2 Agriculture, food quality and nutritionThe relevance of holistic research approa-ches and methods in organic food and farming Holistic research would be the appropri-ate approach in organic and biodynamic food and farming research, because it corresponds with the theoretical, ethical and practical origin of these farming sys-tems, food production and nutrition. 17 What would happen, if ecological research was not holistic? In this case the resear - cher applies analytical methods in a redu-ced experimental design in order to solve single or isolated problems. This approach is only useful with the aim to achieve process and performance optimization, but not for improve the system as whole. 18 As organic farming tries to work in practi-ce with holistic methods, which take into account the complexity of the agrarian system, also ecological research must include holistic approaches. For instance, biodynamic plant breeders have already started decades ago to develop crop and vegetable varieties and seeds, which are bred following holistic and complementa-ry research aspects. These varieties match the special needs of organic and especially ELIANT - Memorandum 201130biodynamic agriculture and horticulture better than conventional varieties. Biodynamic plant breeding research does not study plants under lab or greenhouse conditions or in controlled field experi-ments, since these designs alienate the plant material from its original context (i.e. nature and environment). In cont - rast, plants are examined in their natural environment by using phenomenological methods. Modern phenomenological research (based on the scientific approach of J. W. von Goethe) 19 is not an outdated old-fashioned methodology, but can contribute significantly to the develop - ment of modern crop varieties as well as the development of complementary and anthroposophic medicinal products.Modern conventional research methods, which transform the natural environ-ment of living organisms into an artificial analytical environment, are reductionist and in many cases not appropriate to sti-mulate sustainable agricultural system in accordance with the natural ecosystems. It cannot be assumed a priori that the scientific results obtained in an analytical environment (lab) are still connected in reality with the original natural context of the research object. 20 By subjecting a living organism to an analytical environ-ment, it is not only alienated from its ori-gin, but also prone to reconstruction (i.e. GMO plants). As performance depends on standardized conditions, one also has to standardize the nature and envi-ronment in which these reconstructed organisms will grow. Chemical plant pro - tection and hermetically closed animal production facilities are result from the projection of research results gained in the analytical environment into agricultu-ral practice. Reductionist research implies industrial agriculture! 21 Organic and biodynamic research is trying to broaden the scientific base and methods in order to develop an agricul-tural practice, which does not abolish the natural environment by replacing it by only industrial farming. Biodynamic food is produced in accordance with na-ture and not by alienating, suppressing or violating it.The Goethean scientific approach (on which the anthroposophic scientific methods are based) and its potential are largely unknown and still underesti-mated today. Not only biodynamic plant breeders are using this holistic approach successfully in their research. 22 The Goe - thean methodology is also a valuable tool in risk assessment research concerning GMO plants, as it has allowed the identifi-cation of non-target effects with respect to growth dynamics and morphology of GM potato, tomato and spring wheat. 23 Another complementary scientific ap - proach, which must be acknowledged, is the field of experience-based knowledge. Especially in sociology scientists are inte - rested in this qualitative research method. It has been successfully implemented in the field of agriculture by including farmers in the research process, since ResearchELIANT - Memorandum 2011311985.24 Experience-based science leads to knowledge which is gained by the action of peers. An organic farmer has to develop his practice in this way in order to manage weeds or to prevent animal diseases in the following years. To achieve this goal, holistic or integrative thinking and acting are mandatory.What is the difference compared with na-tural scientific processes? Natural science is the epistemology of thinking whereas experience-based science orients itself towards practical experience, or is mainly based on action.\"On-farm-research\" , \"farmer-participatory-research\" and \"life long learning by doing\" are important instruments in the tool-kit of experience-based science. Whereas natural science relates its research results only to standardized conditions, experi-ence-based science must link its results to different natural and ecosystemic prere - quisites, because every farm or agricultu-ral system has its own holistic context. In sum, it can be stated that natural science should acknowledge the importance of experience-based scientific methods in agricultural research.In biodynamic research, the so called \"picture-forming methods\" are under continuous development. They help to complement and to extend existing scientific criteria of food quality. 25 The approach encompasses the analysis and the understanding of the global effect of food in human nutrition, as well as the process under which food was produced and processed, beyond the study of its physical composition. For the time being, research into food quality and nutritional effects is still too much limited to conven-tional, analytical parameters. Nutrition and food quality assessment as well as their impact on animal and human health must be studied under a broadened scientific approach. 26 Complementary and holistic research approaches like the \"picture-for - ming methods\" can contribute substanti-ally to improve food quality, nutrition and health and should therefore be integrated in future European research programmes. We call upon the Commission to integrate biodynamic research into the 8th and following research framework programmes of the EU. This could be realised by integra-ting the existing technology plat-form \"TP Organics\" into the frame - work programmes or into a new platform \"Holistic research\" (see request 6.1) 6.3 Research in Anthroposophic MedicineAs outlined before, Anthroposophic Medicine combines conventional and complementary medicine in an integra-tive system. Anthroposophic Medicine research takes the multidimensionality of the human being into consideration, together with developmental potenti-al on its physical, vital, emotional and spiritual level. This integrative approach uses conventional scientific methodolo -ELIANT - Memorandum 201132gies as well as methodologies developed specifically for the requirements of Anth-roposophic Medicines. Frontier research by Anthroposophic Medicine includes the adequate evaluation of living systems in both health and illness. Prerequisites for this research are: the autonomy of science; epistemological pluralism; appli-cation possibilities for individual teams; and transparent and efficient support, even for small research units. This issue is of special importance to the growing, but still small research units of Anthroposo - phic Medicine. ELIANT welcomes the objective of current EU health research under FP7 to improve the health of European citizens and boost the competitiveness of health-related industries and businesses, as well as to address global health issues. ELI-ANT supports the focus of the EU health research policy primarily on enhancing health promotion, encouraging primary prevention concepts and disease pre - vention, developing and validating new therapies, concentrating on healthy ageing, sustainable health systems and promotion of sustainable life quality. ELIANT regards the intention to provide specific funding for both SME-specific projects and topics which are attractive to SMEs or organizations that are 'newco - mers' to FP7 as a step forward, including the attention given to research-career support in the framework of the Marie Curie Actions.ELIANT welcomes in particular the recent inclusion of aspects of complementary medicine in the EU research policy within the 'CAMbrella' project and the project 'Good Practice in Traditional Chinese Medicine Research' under FP7. This widening of the scope and the inclu- sion of integrative and complementary medicine issues in EU-funded research was overdue. Anthroposophic Medicine research has been a pioneer in several specific medical fields, such as chronic diseases, focusing on the self-healing forces in a human being, on prevention, and on healthy ageing in the broadest sense. Research in Anthroposophic Medicine has contribu- ted to the development of new systems for adequately evaluating medicinal products - in particular complementary medicinal products - as well as to phar - maco-vigilance projects for the improve - ment in the wider health systems. Some examples of how Anthroposophic medicinal research has contributed to medical progress are the following: One of the biggest pharmaco-vigilance networks in Europe monitored about one million systematically-documented prescriptions and evaluated the safety of Anthroposophic medicinal products. In these studies the low rate of adverse drug reactions to Anthroposophic reme - dies was confirmed. 27, 28, 29ResearchELIANT - Memorandum 201133For basic research in Anthroposophic Me - dicine, a specific epistemology30 for syste - mic therapy evaluation has been develo - ped and successfully tested and applied, as well as a single case evaluation by the new research tool of \"Cognition-Based Medicine\" . 31 Anthroposophic research proved the value of the best-known Anthroposophic Medicine products, which are Viscum album extracts (VAE, mistletoe). VAE are the most used remedies in oncology in German-speaking countries. Around 50-70% of all oncology patients in these countries use mistletoe. Viscum album is the most thoroughly researched plant-extract worldwide: more than 3500 related scientific publications are availab - le (overall view in 32). Systematic reviews con- firm the effectiveness of Viscum album extracts on quality of life 33, 34 and on other relevant outcome parameters.35 A \"Good Clinical Praxis\" (GCP) outcome study under routine daily conditions con-firmed the results of a Swiss Health Tech-nology Assessment and demonstrated the effectiveness and positive cost-bene - fit ratio of the different Anthroposophic medical therapy modalities. 36 Systematic reviews of eurythmy therapy37 and art therapy confirmed their effectiveness. The first chair of integrative medicine at a university in Germany was in the field of Epistemology and Anthroposophic Medicine at the University of Witten / Her- decke. In the last years additional scien-tific Anthroposophic Medicine institutes were created (www.medsektion-goethe - anum.org/forschung/forschungsinstitute). Scientific education and skill training for students in Anthroposophic Medicine has been established in several countries, as well as at the University of Witten-Her - decke, as an integrated part of medical studies. The evaluation of Anthroposophic Me - dicine in 2006 in Switzerland by a Health Technology Assessment 38, 39, (HTA) provi- ded a good overview of the dimension of Anthrosophic medicinal engagement. This HTA was based on a systematic review of 189 clinical studies and concluded that the system of Anthroposophic Medicine is ef-fective, economical and safe. Out of these 189 clinical studies, 180 studies demonst - rated a positive result (better or equal) for the Anthroposophic Medicines compared to conventional medicine in term of effec - tiveness, cost-benefit and safety. Building on this expertise and experi- ence, ELIANT expects that in the next EU Research Programme (FP 8) the medical as well as the socio-economic determi-nants of health will continue to have a role in EU research policy - in spite of the different overall priorities as outlined in the strategy of EU 2020. ELIANT regards continuing research into ELIANT - Memorandum 201134the contribution and added value of inte - grative and complementary medicine for public health in Europe as indispensable. ELIANT expects that the CAMbrella pro - ject will provide convincing evidence of the urgent need to include such research in the EU Research Programme. Such projects must be included in the current FP7 and in the outline of the FP8. ELIANT considers the realization of the objectives laid down in the Green Pa-per on future EU research policy 40 as an opportunity and a leap forward for research on integrative medical systems and hopes that these considerations will come into full use. ELIANT insists on the necessity of revising several aspects of the research manage - ment systems of the Framework Pro - grammes. This applies on the one hand to the need to design projects with the objective of enabling even smaller and more innovative research units to partici-pate in respective tenders. It includes, on the other hand, the build-up of adequate project-evaluation procedures that will provide the necessary expertise and in-novative capacities to assess applications even from the integrative and comple - mentary medicinal sector. The lack of this capacity has been a major set-back for projects of the integrative and comple - mentary sector so far. In regard to the contribution of research in Anthroposophic Medicine to improve the health of citizens - as part of integrative and complementary medicine. ELIANT urges the EU Commission to include in the Framework tenders projects and financial support for research into the life-science approaches of Anthroposophic Medicine, for research into the further develop - ment of adequate modern and scientific methods to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of their medicinal products, for re - search into the new paradigm of patient-doctor relationships, and for research into the EU's chaotic regulatory systems for integrative and complementary medici-nes. These regulatory systems run contra-ry to the common market principle of the Union and create an unacceptable barrier for patients and citizens to have access to this medicine. 41 ELIANT demands: ELIANT asks for additions to the research manage - ment systems of the Framework Programmes including provision for smaller and more innovati-ve research units and adequate project-evaluation procedures to evaluate tender submission from the integrative and complementary medicinal sector. To make use of the expertise and experience of Anthroposophic Medicine, ELIANT urges the EU Commission to suggest research projects for research into the life-ResearchELIANT - Memorandum 201135science approaches of Anthroposo - phic Medicine, for research into the further development of adequate modern and scientific methods to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of their medicinal products, for research into the new paradigm of patient-doctor relationships, and for research into the EU's chaotic regulatory systems for integrative and complementary medicines. 6.4 Disabilities: Research in Anthropo - sophical curative education and social therapy The position of anthroposophical cura- tive education and social therapy in the European Union The almost 500 institutions of Anthro - posophy-based curative education and social therapy are in most countries of the European Union part of the official social structure and are as a rule supported by the organs of state. The methods of Anthropo - sophy-based curative education and social therapy can be learned at about 40 training locations, generally professional schools of the service sector, most of which are accredited by the state, lead to a national professional license and are supported in the context of national programs. Academic presence Anthroposophical curative education and social therapy is represented at the following academic institutions with chairs and/or academic training pro - grams (bachelor's/master's): University of Aberdeen, Scotland: BA Hons.-Program in cooperation with the Camphill institutions Aberdeen (Norma Hart) University of Plymouth, England: BA Social Care in cooperation with the Ita Wegman College, Wuppertal, Germany University of Leiden, Netherlands: BA in Curative Education (Prof. Dr. Eric Baars) Free University (VU), Amsterdam: Bernard-Lievegoed Chair \"Ethical aspects of care and support from perspective\" (Prof. Dr. Hans Reinders) Ge - sellschaft, Bonn, Germany: BA Social Care, MA management, education and research in the areas of cura- tive education and social therapy; admission to Ph.D. or Ed.D. degree (Campus Alfter) (Prof. Dr. Maximilian Buchka, Prof. Dr. R\u00fcdiger Grimm, Prof. Dr. Bernhard Schmalenbach). Research and collaborationStaff members in the areas of anthropo - sophical curative education and social therapy, who are actively involved in the field of research, work together on a re - gular basis in the international \"Academic Section of the Council for Curative Edu- cation and Social Therapy\" . The individual universities and scientists are networked in their respective research communities and ELIANT - Memorandum 201136associations and hold regular meetings. The \"International Training Section of the Council for Curative Education and Social Therapy\" is the organ of cooperation in the field of vocational training, study and learning. It provides a common platform of practical and academic training programs. Research areas The area of foundational research includes epistemological questions in curative education and social therapy, ethical prob - lems and issues, as well as the development of psychological, educational and medical procedures and treatment options. Current examples: \"Compendium of anthroposophical curative education\" (Grimm, Kaschu-bowski); education\" (Frielingsdorf, In the area of practical research, the appli-cation and development of methods and approaches for the various areas (early childhood, kindergarten, school, work, living areas, etc.) stand at the centre. The core aim also consists in developing ap - propriate ways of social participation in the community for persons with disabilities. Current research projects: \"Formation of relationship in curative education and social therapy - the professional ethics of care\" (Pim Blomaard); \"Paths to quality\" \"Anthroposophical communities as places to live\" (Christoph Stamm). In the educational research, the central concern is the development of a progres-sive improvement in the integration of practical application and theoretical re - search. An important aspect is the under - standing of social and therapeutic action as standing close to the artistic process, and thus arriving at innovative forms of training. For this purpose the \"Internatio - nal Training Section\" established two edu-cational research projects in the context of the Leonardo da Vinci Programme of the European Union toward the development of an \"International Handbook on Educa-tion in Curative Education and Social The - rapy\" as well as an international research project on \"Training of Trainers\" . Anthroposophical curative education and social therapy could, because of its close-knitted European network and decades-long cooperation among the national associations and institutions within the European Union, achieve valuable develop - mental work toward promoting the quality of inclusion of people with disabilities at all levels - school, therapy, work, and living. They could also do this on the basis of their ResearchELIANT - Memorandum 201137manifold social experiences and processes in the formation of communities with and without disabilities. As a methodologically oriented movement it can, above and beyond this, also provide important initia-tives toward ethically necessary but oft-neglected questions concerning the image of man. It sees itself in this respect as a joint actor with other methodological cognitive academic approaches. It would be impor - tant that holistic approaches (among them anthroposophical curative education and social therapy) be required of the European Union in order to counterbalance one-sided expressions of working with people with disabilities. Include current and future research projects and methods of anthropo - sophic curative education and social therapy into European R&D frame - work programmes. 7. Conclusion of Part I ELIANT recognises that the collection of signatures it has successfully orga-nised and its invitation to examine a great number of matters where ELIANT considers that a legal act of the Union is required puts a substantial burden on the Commission and its services. This is, however, understandable since, for many years, ELIANT's members have often tried in vain to convince the Euro - pean institutions of the need to produce legal rules which appropriately respect the particularities of initiatives of ap - plied Anthroposophy. Now it is proven that these requests have a large support in society and this should duly be taken into account. The examination by the Commission of the various matters covered by this Memorandum will take some time and might need some more information to be given to its services. ELIANT and its core members are at the disposal of the Commission any time both for meetings and written comments. ELIANT and its members also expect that when in future the Commission prepares new legislation in areas where initiatives of applied Anthroposophy or any similar initiative are active it will carefully study their specific concerns of a sensitive mode of life. ELIANT and its members would like to be heard by the Commission before a decision is taken on the submitted requests and remains at the disposal to the Commission for any further informa-tion needed.Conclusion Part IELIANT - Memorandum 201138--------------------------------------------------- Footnotes 1 Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on the citizens' initiative, OJ L 65 / 1 of 13.3.2011 2 ARC Agricultural and Rural Convention \"A Communica - tion from Civil society to the European Union Institutions on the future Agricultural and Rural Policy\" .

Objectives of ELIANT's ECI campaign Since its establishment in 2006, ELIANT has believed strongly in the coming into force of the new instrument. The wording in article 11\u00a7 4 of the Treaty on the EU has its origin in the draft Treaty on a European Constitution. Noting that the requests to recognize their specific needs had failed on numerous occasi-ons during the European law-making process, the members of ELIANT joined forces and engaged themselves in the collection of one million signatures. They did so in order to gain the necessa-ry quantitative backing for their de - mands and to demonstrate that applied Anthroposophy is a relevant part of society in Europe and worldwide. ELIANT is aware that its campaign is a pioneer exercise undertaken at a time when neither the Lisbon Treaty nor the regulation on the citizens' initiative were yet in force. However, ELIANT shaped its campaign as closely as possible to the requirements of the article 11\u00a7 4 TEU This Part II of ELIANT's Memorandum will show that this objective has been ELIANT - Memorandum 201142achieved to such an extent that many of the specific requirements of the regu-lation are satisfied. In section 2.2 below reference will be made to the articles of the Regulation (EU) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 Feb - ruary 2011 on the citizens' initiative (OJ of EU L 65/1 of11.3.2011). As our statis-tics in the annex show, a number of the supporters of ELIANT come from non-EU European countries and from elsewhere (Annex 1). We know that these signa-tures do not legally count inside the EU but we felt it was important for the EU institutions to understand that the general humane character of the anth-roposophic movement is valued beyond EU Member States themselves. 2. Realisation of thecampaign 2.1. The method of collecting signatures and the final results of the signature campaignAfter a pilot phase starting in November 2006, the ELIANT campaign began on 1 February 2007 and terminated at the end of December 2010 after getting one milli-on EU signatures. The instruments for collecting signatures were established at the very beginning of the activities. Read further brief details in Annex 2 Signatures were collected: a) On ELIANT signature sheetsb) On ELIANT advertisement pages in magazines, on ELIANT postcards and on ELIANT brochures We asked for registration of First Name and Surname, address, signature and optional Email address. See attached the English signature list with charter on reverse (Annex 3). c) By Online Voting with confirmation by email Since March 2007 we have been using an online voting system in 11 languages at our website www.eliant.eu. We ask for First name, Surname, City, Country and email. We use email confirmation and reply plus verification and registration of email address to avoid more than one vote per person. Thus we achieved the following results: The final results of the signature campaign December 13, 2010 EU/total Non-EU/total 1.001.671 118.630 Signature 336.355 31.069Realisation - Memorandum 2011432.2 Conformity of the ELIANT cam- paign with the requirements of article 11\u00a74 of the Treaty on the EU 2.2.1 Citizens' Committee (Regulation article 3) The ELIANT Alliance is composed of 10 core member organisations, most of them operating Europe wide. The chairpersons of these ten organisations form the assembly of ELIANT, which is its governing body. The following nationalities are represented among the chairpersons: FR, NL, DE, GB and CH. The headquarters of the ELIANT member or - ganisations are in these countries, with one additional headquarters in FI. The requirement of seven nationals from seven countries is thus not complete - ly fulfilled but ELIANT's composition comes close to it. 2.2.2 Minimum number of Member States from which citizens must come (Reg. art. 7 \u00a71)To make sure that signatures came from a \"significant number of Member States\" we counted the signatures and did the distribution by countries. For the paper responses, we did this during the process of counting (see also: Requirements for the verification and authentication of si-gnatures (2.2.6)). For online voting, it was done through the country chosen by the person who signed. The numbers were counted and show that we gathered signatures from all 27 EU countries. 2.2.3 Minimum number of signatures per Member State (Reg. art. 7 \u00a72 and annex I)The level of mobilization of 0.21 % of the EU population of about 493 million by ELIANT's campaign differs from country to country between 1.3% (Poland) and 455% (Netherlands): see statistical Annex 1. A comparison of ELIANT's figures with the requirements of Article 7 and Annex I of the regulation concerning the minimum number of signatures per Member state shows that ELIANT easily meets these requirements in 10 Member States: that is many more than the required one quarter see table in Annex 1a 2.2.4 Minimum age (Reg. art. 3 \u00a74) We suggested in our response to the Commission's Green Paper on ECI to link the minimum age for supporting an ECI to the voting age of Member states for the EP elections. This corresponds to Article 3 \u00a7 4 of the regulation. We did not require citi-zens to indicate their age while signing our ECI sheet. But we assume that in general all citizens who have signed are older than 18 years since the nature of our campaign addresses itself to adults. We deleted signa-tures when it was obvious a child's writing. 2.2.5 Form and wording of a citizen's initia-tive (Reg. art. 2 no 1, art. 4 and annex II)The signatures support the ELIANT char - ter as adopted by the 10 core members in 2006. The charter's section \"Aims of the Alliance\" states the subject matters and objectives of the proposals which the Com-ELIANT - Memorandum 201144mission is invited to submit. The Alliance requests that legal safeguards are secured for initiatives for applied Anthroposophy in the fields of agriculture, education, special needs education and medicine in the con-text of European law making. Thus ELIANT states the subject matter and the objecti-ves of the proposal(s) the Commission is invited to take.This corresponds to Article 4 and Annex II of the regulation. The common denomina-tor of ELIANT's invitation to bring forward a variety of legislative proposals is that the Commission is invited to acknowledge in its proposals the high value of the huma-ne approach underlying the various fields of applied Anthroposophy. It is true that this umbrella initiative contains a number of matters where the citizens supporting it consider that a legal act of the Union is required. This is in our view perfectly compatible with article 11\u00a7 4. The text does not require an approach which limits each ECI to only one single legislative proposal by the Commission. Part I of this memorandum shows in detail that all matters considered by ELIANT to require a legal act of the Union satisfy the admissibility conditions of Article 4 \u00a72 b, c and d of the regulation. 2.2.6 Collection and verification of signa- tures (Reg. art. 5, 6 and 8)The regulation admits the collection of statements of support in paper form and electronically. ELIANT used the two possibi-lities but could not respect all the require - ments for the format of those statements. ELIANT had to invent procedures for the verification of the signatures. ELIANT feels that she has found a common, simple but efficient way forward which could serve as an example for further considerations on this question. ELIANT submitted her experiences during the discussions on the Commission's proposal for the regulation but to her regret without much success. The experiences might still find some interest now during the time of the imple - mentation of the regulation. a) collection and storage As a first step, we counted the signatu- res and did the distribution by coun- tries within our campaign office under supervision of the project manager. The distribution was done during the pro - cess of counting. The results are saved monthly together with the online votes in an excel sheet. Following this, the signature sheets are stored by country and sent to the professional company (PRODATA / DE) for verification and authentication of all paper signatures. The scanned and analyzed signature sheets are saved at the company carrying out this work in Germany. It is not possible to access this data online but it is possible to put it on a data storage medium to view the saved Realisation of the campaignELIANT - Memorandum 201145data in Brussels if required. All online votes are saved at a server by the Netherlands database company \"ef-ficiency online\" . It is possible to access the results online with a special code. Confidentiality: data privacy was recog-nized at all steps of collecting and hand-ling. Personal data will be used solely for ELIANT purposes and will under no cir - cumstances be passed on to third parties. b) Verification: ELIANT commissioned on its own ac - count two private firms with experience in data processing to check the reliabi-lity of the counting and the validity and completeness of the signatures. ELIANT has asked the two companies to report on the reliability of the signatures and on their findings.In some parts, 80% of the EU paper signa-tures and some of the Non-EU signature sheets were scanned and analyzed by the above-mentioned specialised company in Germany. In this process we eliminated the paper duplicates in our database. We attach the report from PRODATA (DE) concerning this process and the results (Annex 4). All online votes are collected on a ser - ver hosted by the professional database company in the Netherlands mentioned above. The list by \"efficiency online\" (NL) of all confirmed signatures is attached (Annex 5). It is possible to display a record of all the online information given. All confirmed online votes are verified as a single name, email combination. About 87% of all signatures collected in the EU are verified. The main finding is that about 8% of the signatures collected were duplicates and were therefore not counted. The Duplicates on paper are much lower (3.6%) than the Duplicates by online voting (13%). Our actual figures are without duplicates as far as verified signatures are concerned (80% of paper signatures and all online signatures). It should be noted that ELIANT collected about 72.000 EU signatu-res more than indicated above. The number of EU online-signatures without confirmation in the database is 72.138 (as at 13.12.2010). From our expe - rience we consider several main reasons why people did not confirm their vote: People forget that they have to confirm separately to complete the voting process The email address has a spelling mistake and the Response Email did not arrive The response email is treated as spam A technical problem means that the email is not delivered to the person The Confirmation Link does not work because of protection on the compu-ter (in many cases) The Person does not understand how to confirm and that he/she has to push the button in the e-mail A person has used an Email address ELIANT - Memorandum 201146from another person (in many cases: married couple). Even if we assume an error rate of 50% for all these reasons there are still about 36.000 ELIANT online petition votes more than we now counted. The surplus compensates well beyond the assumed non-valid Duplicates on paper (3.6%) from non-scanned signature lists (20%). We believe that we present to the Commis-sion a very high level of verification for this kind of initiative and that we have experi-enced a method of verification which might serve as an example for future ECI cam-paigns, possibly under a later somewhat simplified regulation having the advantage that organisers need not communicate with 27 different national authorities. 2.2.7 Time limit for the collection of signatu- res (Reg. Art.5 \u00a75)We started the signature collection with a pilot phase in November 2006 and de - cided in February 2007 to launch the ECI campaign. Within the time frame of three years we collected 925.012 signatures inside EU. We finally reached the goal of 1 Million inside EU by the end of November 2010. Our example shows that the collec - tion period of 12 month as stated in the implementing regulation is very short. 2.2.8 Transparency and funding (Reg. art. 4 \u00a71) The costs of the campaign are being met by the financial support provided by foundation and individual donors as well as from the group of the alliance suppor -ters. Contacts were continuously sought to potential partners from the social envi-ronment. One core member (Foundation for Anthroposophic Medicine) took over the responsibility for all financial tasks for this campaign. The campaign ELIANT was published as a project within the foun-dation. All costs and donations for this project were accounted separately and checked by a certified public accountant. An overview on all income and expen-diture is attached as Annex 6. From this it can be deduced that ELIANT spent 0.77 Euro per signature. 3. Conclusion andexperiences As mentioned above this ELIANT ECI campaign is one of the pioneers for a European collection of signatures. Until now only very few and well established organizations have attempted this new venture. The partners of this campaign were, at the beginning, unknown to most citizens. In this regard, the \"Action ELIANT\" was a real grass roots campaign. The result indicates that in a motivated and professional network, it is possible even for a small organization to convince many people to support a common goal. The challenge of conducting a signature campaign all across the whole EU lies in sustaining this level of conviction and motivation with the umbrella organisa-tions and their members involved over a certain period of time. But in fact it is Conclusion and experiencesELIANT - Memorandum 201147a very complex process to spread out the campaign over all EU countries. For a newcomer it takes time to build up a network and mobilise people to get in-volved actively. It took also time to raise awareness of other organisations with similar aims and to cooperate with them with the view of getting their assistance in presenting our campaign with their own means of communication. But, in the end, there are many citizens who really hope that their voice counts and will be heard. If the new ECI Instrument gives real power to the citizens, the European motto \"United in diversity\" is being kept alive and is ignited in our hearts.It might be reminded that ELIANT, on the basis of her experiences gained, participated actively in the debate on the shaping of the regulation on the citizens' initiative from start to end. ELI-ANT submitted contributions since the publication of the Commissions Green Paper till the debate in Parliament and Council. Some suggestions were taken up, others not.

A full-time po sition was created in Febr uary 2007 for the campaign management in order to coordinate, execut e and develop the operative measures. In summer 2007 a journalist joined to give support for all PR activities. Additional support was provided by student assist ants and voluntary workers. In order to popularise the promotion, th e logo \"Action ELIANT\" was drafted and the signature list and associated charter were tr anslated in all EU languages.

The charter and further information can be found at: www.eliant.eu Help us to achieve this goal by the end of 2009 ELIANT - Memorandum 201155 Aims of the Alliance Human dignity and individual development are core values of European culture, to whose evolution Rudolf Steiner's ini-tiatives of applied anthroposophy have contributed for over 80 years. Especially in the fields of agriculture, education, special needs education and medicine, humane approaches of the highest quality have been developed, and found world-wide acknowledgement and esteem. The Alliance's task is to secure legal safeguards for such initiatives and to develop them further as a contribution towards the further shaping of Europe. In the reality of the European context, the right to individual development for every citizen requires not only freedom of choice but also the availability of choices. Parents must be able to choose schools which accord with their educational convictions. Each person should be able to access the medi-cal care and type of diet that corresponds to his way of life. In Europe, basic and human rights should not be restricted in such a way as to disadvantage these cultural initiatives. The Alliance is setting the course for pursuing this aim. This necessitates basic social and legal policies to underpin institutions and developments which safeguard and sup-port the diversity of different lifestyles. Pluralism of scien-tific methods, and freedom of research and teaching must be guaranteed. Freedom to choose one's profession and course of training also depend on a context of social pluralism. The Alliance's work and mode of operation We, the core members of this Alliance, agree to collaborate on the basis of a solidarity of initiatives. The Alliance will offer us mutual support in our respective, Europe-focused plans and campaigns. Our aim is to practise collaboration and mu- tual aid, with integrity and transparency. We thereby hope to realise necessary initiatives in different fields with the widest possible democratic support, low administrative costs, and keen awareness of dialogue and communication. We will continue to exert influence on the development of Eu- ropean policies and legislature, and to develop and maintain existing contacts with European institutions. We are an integral part of civil society at the European level, aiming to create as comprehensive a network as possible with organisations that pursue similar goals. We participate actively in public relations activities and - as far as this is feasible - collaborate in conferences, courses and workshops that correspond with the aims of the Alliance. In order to further our aims we are seeking partners in the fields of culture, economics and politics. We hope to collabo- rate with institutions, associations and individuals in public life who share our commitment to lasting protection of each person's freedoms, quality of life and individual development potential. Together with these partners we intend to support positions and initiatives which will contribute to shaping Eu-rope's future according to the aims and principles described above. The resolutions and decisions which affect the Alliance as a whole will be taken by mutual agreement of its members. Until the transfer to Brussels, the secretariat is located at the Foundation for Anthroposophic Medicine at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland.Alliance membership encompasses core members of the Alliance that join together in solidarity with the stated aims, and also associate mem - bers.
