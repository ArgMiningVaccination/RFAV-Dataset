May 2023 Friends Rahelio was amazing! We had a shamanic healing session that did not disappoint. Felt very clear-headed afterward and have not felt that way in a very long time. He is also a great conversationalist. I feel like I can talk to him for hours about many different topics and never get bored. He's super knowledgable, kind-hearted and friendly. He also gave us tips to take home with us! We really enjoyed our visit with Rahelio. It was the highlight of our trip to Sedona! Thank you.

Feb 2023 Rahelio is a kind, gifted, and magical being.. There was a certain familiarity to him. I found his approach to balancing and cleansing, which is a culmination of different religious and spiritual practices, to be quite effective. I highly recommend a visit with him the next time in Sedona! Written March 4, 2023 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Jun 2022 Family As beautiful and healing this trip as it was fifteen years ago when I first went. Absolutely unforgettable. It doesn't matter what you believe in, you will heal -- you will also meet new people and learn new things. The tour is entirely authentic and culturally rich. Most tours here are seriously colonized and only care about money and picture spots with no respect to the native land. Sedona has been colonized HARD in the past few decades-- golf courses everywhere, corporations popping up, resorts making their home on sacred ground-- but despite all that, we were able to access and learn about the more hidden wonders of the land. I personally hate feeling like a tourist (I don't speak for anyone else of course). On this trip Rahilio worked tirelessly to connect us with the land. I'm not quick to friendliness either-- I'm sort of cynical-- but the energy of the group was so instantly like family that we talked like we knew each other for years. Everything was beautiful and I genuinely felt grateful to be there for those few hours. Do NOT miss this tour.

Jun 2022 Our second time with Rahelio. It's truly like nothing else. We did a spiritual cleansing and a vortex tour with meditation on the mountain. If you can open yourself to this experience you will not be disappointed. He is a courteous and knowledgeable guide. He is friendly and respectful. He will answer any question you ask and is eager to help you understand your experience. We took our teens in Nov to tour the vortexes and ages 12-15 all 4 meditated and felt moved by it. Just the two of us this time and it was an even deeper connection with the experience. We will certainly come again.

May 2022 Friends Absolutely love Rahelio! The sites he led us to were breath taking, and the drumming sessions were transformative. Loved the medicine wheel readings. Spot on! Can't wait to do another tour with him when I am back in Sedona. Can't wait to do another tour with him when I am back in Sedona.

May 2022 I met Rahelio as part of a spiritual retreat I was attending. My experience with him was nothing short of magical, soulful and grounding. He led us on adventures that encompassed opportunities to truly connect with Mother Nature and Father Sky. He led several ceremonies that included the flute and drumming which was unlike anything I had experienced before. He was able to connect with each of us in a unique way and share his wisdom of the land and of connecting with the Earth. I am blessed to have had spent time with Rahelio and look forward to meeting with him again soon.

May 2022 Rahelio's knowledge and guidance was truly magical. The drum meditation by mother earth and father sky was so profound, I didn't want it to stop. He has a kind and gentle soul that when he spoke you leaned in to listen. I highly recommend him! Thank you again Rahelio!!
