According to CMS, a QCDR is a CMS-ap proved entity that collects medical and/or clinical data for the purpose of patient and disease trackin g to foster improvement in the quality of care prov ided to patients. The AAAAI Allergy Asthma and Immunology Q uality Clinical Data Registry was developed in collaboration with CECity, a leading provider of cl oud-based registry platforms, in 2014 and has been updated to include additional measures for the 2016 reporti ng year. In order to be considered as a QCDR, the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology ( AAAAI) submitted a self-nomination to CMS and successfully completed the qualification process. Requirements As finalized in the 2016 Medicare Physician Fee Sch edule (MPFS), successful reporting through a QCDR i n 2016 for the purposes of avoiding the 2018 payment adjustment of 2% requires the following: Report on at least nine (9) measures covering at l east three (3) of the National Quality Strategy (NQS) domains Of these measures, report at least two (2) outcome s measures Report each measure for 50% of the eligible profes sional's patients that apply to the measure across all payers (ie: not limited to Medicare patients) In addition, as of 2016 and subsequent years, CMS w ill allow both individual EPs and group practices participating in the GPRO to report quality measure s via a QCDR . Please note that, a group practice is required to register with CMS to participate in the PQRS GPRO. Please refer to page 3 for a listing of each measur e by its NQS domain The six NQS domains include: Communication and Care Coordination Community Population Health Effective Clinical Care Efficiency and Cost Reduction Patient Safety Person and Caregiver-Centered Experience and Outco mes Measures A qualified clinical data registry differs from a q ualified registry in reporting requirements and is the only PQRS reporting method that hosts non-PQRS measures appro ved by CMS for the purposes of PQRS reporting. Non-PQRS measures are measures that are not contain ed in the PQRS measures set released by CMS for the applicable reporting period. These can be \"home grown\" measures developed by entities such as the J oint Task Force on Quality and Performance Measurement ( a joint task force of the AAAAI and the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology) or PQRS m easures that have substantive differences in the manner reported by the QCDR. PQRS measure #398: Optimal Asthma Control is used i n the AAAAI QCDR without the upper age limit of 50 with the permission of the measure steward, Minneso ta Community Measurement, and is therefore considered a non-PQRS measure. Other non-PQRS measu res in the AAAAI QCDR include measures from the Bridges to Excellence \u00ae Asthma Care Recognition Program, owned and develop ed by Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute, Inc and former PQ RS measure #64: Asthma: Assessment of Asthma Control. The measure is used without the upper age limit of 64 with permission of the measure steward, the American Medical Association-convened Physician's C onsortium on Practice Improvement. Additionally, th e AAAAI QCDR hosts 9 PQRS measures. Registration In order to register for the AAAAI QCDR, go Thera py for Persistent Asthma - Ambulatory Care Setting - National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinical Care 2016 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: REGISTRY ONLY DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients aged 5 years and older with a diagnosis of persistent asthma who were prescribe d long-term control medication INSTRUCTIONS: This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for all patients with a diagnosis of persistent asthma seen during the reporting peri od. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measur e based on the services provided and the measure- specific denominator coding. This measure will be calculated with 3 performance rates: 1) Patients prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (ICS ) as their long-term control medication 2) Patients prescribed alternative long-term contro l medications (non-ICS) 3) Total patients prescribed long-term control medi cation Measure Reporting via Registry: ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, QDC code and patient demographics are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denomina tor. The listed numerator options are used to repor t the numerator of the measure. The quality-data codes listed do not need to be sub mitted for registry-based submissions; however, the se codes may be submitted for those registries that ut ilize claims data. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 5 years and older with a diagnosi s of persistent asthma Denominator Instructions: Documentation of persistent asthma must be present. One method of identifying persistent asthma is, at a minimum, daily use of short-acting bronchodilators Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 5 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis for Asthma (mild, moderate or severe) (1038F) NUMERATOR: Patients who were prescribed long-term control medi cation Definition: Long-Term Control Medication Includes: Patients prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (the pr eferred long-term control medication at any step of asthma pharmacological therapy) OR 8 Patients prescribed alternative long-term control m edications (inhaled steroid combinations, anti- asthmatic combinations, antibody inhibitor, leukotr iene modifiers, mast cell stabilizers, methylxanthines) OR an acceptable alternative long- term control medication at one or more visits in the 12-month period OR patient already taking in haled corticosteroid OR an acceptable alternative long-term control medication as documen ted in current medication list Numerator Options: Performance Met: Inhaled corticosteroids prescribed (4140F) OR Performance Met: Alternative long-term control medication prescribed (4144F) OR Patient Performance Exclusion: Documentation of patient reason(s) for not prescrib ing inhaled corticosteroids or alternative long-term co ntrol medication (eg, patient declined, other patient rea son) (4140F with 2P) OR Performance Not Met: Inhaled corticosteroids or alternative long-term co ntrol medication not prescribed, reason not otherwise specified (4140F with 8P) RATIONALE: The following statement is quoted verbatim from the NHLBI/NAEPP guideline (NHLBI, 2007): \"The broad action of ICS on the inflammatory proces s may account for their efficacy as preventive therapy. Their clinical effects include reduction i n severity of symptoms; improvement in asthma contr ol and quality of life; improvement in PEF and spirome try; diminished airway hyper-responsiveness; prevention of exacerbations; reduction in systemic corticosteroid courses; emergency department (ED) care; hospitalizations, and deaths due to asthma; a nd possibly the attenuation of loss of lung n RA 2003; Barnes PJ October 1992) CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbat im from the referenced clinical guidelines: The Expert Panel recommends that long-term control medications be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. The most effective long-term control medications ar e those that attenuate the underlying inflammation ch aracteristic of asthma. (Evidence A) (NHLBI, 2007) The Expert Panel concludes that ICS is the most pot ent and clinically effective long-term control medication for asthma. (Evidence A) (NHLBI, 2007) The Expert Panel concludes that ICS is the most eff ective long-term therapy available for patients who have persistent asthma, and, in general, ICS is wel l tolerated and safe at the recommended dosages.

Asthma is a chronic disease associated with familial, infectious, aller genic, socioeconomic, psychosocial and environmenta l factors. It is not curable but is treatable. Despit e improvements in diagnosis and management, and an increased understanding of the epidemiology, immuno logy, and biology of the disease, asthma prevalence has progressively increased over the pas t 15 years. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: From the National Quality Forum's 2013 report, Pati ent Reported Outcomes (PROs) in Performance Measurement: Patient and family engagement is increasingly ackno wledged as a key component of a comprehensive strategy, (along with performance improvement and a ccountability), to achieve a high quality, affordab le health system. Emerging evidence affirms that patie nts who are engaged in their care tend to experienc e better outcomes and choose less costly but effectiv e interventions. Historically, with the exception of collecting feed back on satisfaction or experience with care, patie nts remain an untapped resource in assessing the qualit y of healthcare and of long-term support services. Patients are a valuable and, arguably, the authorit ative source of information on outcomes beyond experience with care. These include health-related quality of life, functional status, symptom and symptom burden, and health behaviors. Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are stand ardized instruments that capture patients' self- assessment of their health and can provide timely i nformation on patient health status, function and symptoms over time that can be used to improve pati ent-centered care and inform clinical decision- making. The Asthma Control Test TM (ACT) is a validated self-administered survey utili zing 5 questions to assess asthma control on a scale from 0 (poor control) to 5 (total control) in individuals 12 years and older . \u00a9 2002 by QualityMetric Incorporated. Asthma Control Test is a trademark of QualityMetric Incorporated. The Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) is a care giver-assisted, child-completed tool that can be used with or without lung function assessment to as sess pediatric asthma control at home or in clinica l practice for children ages 4-11 years. It consists of 7 questions of which 4 are child-reported and 3 are caregiver-reported questions. \u00a92011 The GlaxoSmithK line Group of Companies. 13 The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) is a validat ed, self-administered survey available in various formats from the developer, Elizabeth F.

Measure Type: Outcome 14 Asthma: Assessment of Asthma Control - Ambulatory C are Setting - National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinica l Care DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients aged 5 years and older with a diagnosis of asthma who were evaluated at least once during the measurement period for asthma contr ol (comprising asthma impairment and asthma risk) INSTRUCTIONS: This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients with asthma seen during the reporting period. This measure may be re ported by clinicians who perform the quality action s described in the measure based on the services prov ided and the measure-specific denominator coding. Data Source: Measure Reporting via Registry: ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, and patient d emographics are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. The listed n umerator options are used to report the numerator o f the measure The quality-data codes listed do not need to be sub mitted for registry-based submissions; however, the se codes may be submitted for those registries that ut ilize claims data. There are no allowable performan ce exclusions for this measure. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 5 years and older with a diagnosi s of asthma Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 5 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis for asthma Patients who were evaluated at least once during th e measurement period for asthma control Numerator Instructions: Completion of a validated questionnaire will also m eet the numerator requirement for this component of the measure. Vali dated questionnaires for asthma assessment include, but are not limited to, the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire [ATAQ], the Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ], or the Asthma C ontrol Test [ACT]. The specifications of this numerator enable documen tation for the impairment and risk components separately to facilitate quality improve ment. Evaluation of asthma impairment and asthma risk must occur during the same medical enco unter. Definition: Evaluation of Asthma Control - Documentation of an evaluation of asthma impairment which must include: daytime symptoms AND nighttime awakenings AND interference with normal activity AND short- acting beta2-agonist use for symptom control AND documentation of asthma risk which must include the number of asthma exacerbations requiring oral syste mic corticosteroids in the prior 12 months. 15 Numerator Quality-Data Coding Options for Reporting Satisfactorily: Performance Met: Asthma impairment assessed (CPT II 2015F) AND Performance Met: Asthma risk assessed (CPT II 2016F) OR Performance Not Met: Asthma impairment not assessed, reason not otherwise specified (2015F with 8P) OR Performance Not Met: Asthma risk not assessed, reason not otherwise specified (2016F with 8P) RATIONALE: The goal of asthma therapy is to achieve asthma con trol. The level of asthma control serves as a basis for treatment modification (ie, whether or not a pa tient needs a step up or step down in therapy). Pat ients with poorly controlled asthma can experience signif icant asthma burden (Fuhlbrigge AL, 2002), decreased quality of life (Schatz M, 2005), and inc reased health utilization. (Vollmer WM, 2002; Schat z M, 2005) A large international study found that gui deline-defined asthma control can be achieved. In t heir trial, 30% of the patients achieved total control ( defined as absence of asthma symptoms) and 60% achieve well-controlled asthma (defined as low-leve l of symptoms or rescue medication use. (Bateman ED, 2004) A follow-up to this study found that this control can be maintained, which can lead to a decrease in the use of unscheduled health care visi ts. (Bateman ED, 2008) CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbat im from the referenced clinical guidelines. The Expert Panel recommends that asthma control be defined as follows: (Evidence A) (NHLBI, 2007) Reduce Impairment Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms (eg, coug hing or breathlessness in the daytime, night, or after exertion) Require infrequent use ( 2 days a week) of SABA for quick relief of symptom s Maintain (near) \"normal\" pulmonary function Maintain normal activity levels (including exercis e and other physical activity and attendance at work or school) Meet patients' and families' expectations of satis faction with asthma care Reduce risk Prevent recurrent exacerbations of asthma and mini mize the need for ED visits or hospitalizations Prevent progressive loss of lung function; for chi ldren, prevent reduced lung growth Provide optimal pharmacotherapy with minimal or no adverse effects The Expert Panel recommends that ongoing monitoring of asthma control be performed to determine whether all the goals of therapy are met\u2014that is re ducing both impairment and risk. (Evidence B) (NHLB I, 2007) The Expert Panel recommends that the frequency of v isits to a clinician for a review of asthma control is a matter of clinical judgment; in general, patients w ho have intermittent or mild persistent asthma that has been under control for at least 3 months should be seen by a physician about every 6 months, and patients who have uncontrolled and/or severe persis tent asthma and those who need additional supervision to help them follow their treatment pla n need to be seen more often. (NHLBI, 2007) The Expert Panel recommends that symptoms and clini cal signs of asthma should be assessed at each health care visit through physical examination and appropriate questions. (EPR-2, 1997) (NHLBI/NAEPP, 2007 ) 16 The AMA-convened Physician Consortium for Performan ce Improvement (PCPI) owned and developed Asthma: Assessment of Asthma Control - Ambulatory C are Setting measure is used with modification to the age range of 5-64 years to 5 years and older wi th permission from the measure owner.

Measure Type: Process 17 Asthma Control: Minimal Important Difference Improv ement - National Quality Strategy Domain: Person and Caregiver-Centered Experience an d Outcomes DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients aged 12 years and older whos e asthma is not well-controlled as indicated by the Asthma Control Test, Asthma Control Questionnaire, or Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire and who demonstrated a minimal important difference imp rovement upon a subsequent office visit during the 12-month reporting period. INSTRUCTIONS: This outcomes measure e is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for all patients with a diagnosis of asthma who demonstrate a score 19 on the Asthma Control Test (ACT), 1.5 on the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or 1 on the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (A TAQ) and who had at least one follow-up ACT, ACQ, or ATA Q within the 12-month reporting period. In order to meet this measure, the patient must demonstrate a m inimal importance difference (MID) improvement between their asthma control score from the initial visit and a subsequent score taken during the 12- month reporting period using the same patient-compl eted questionnaire. An increase in score by greater than or equal to 3 points on the ACT, decrease in s core by greater than or equal to .5 points on the A CQ or a decrease in score by greater than or equal to 1 point on the ATAQ will indicate a minimal importa nce difference improvement and a higher measure perform ance. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the me asure based on the services provided and the measure-specific coding. Data Source: ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, patient demog raphics and medical record data are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. Medical record data and the listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the measure. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 12 years or older whose asthma is not well-controlled and who had at least one follo w- up ACT, ACQ, or ATAQ within the 12-month reporting period. Definition: For the purposes of this measure, asthma that is no t well-controlled will be defined by a score of 19 on the ACT, 1.5 on the ACQ or 1 on the ATAQ. Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 12 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis for asthma not well-controlled based on score of 19 on the ACT or 1.5 on the ACQ or 1 on the ATAQ at one visit AND At least one subsequent patient encounter during th e reporting period with completion of the same asthma assessment patient-completed questionna ire (ACT, ACQ or who demonstrate a minimal important differ ence (MID) improvement using one of the following three asthma assessment patient-completed questionn aires: Change in the Asthma Control Test (ACT) by 3 points Change in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) by 0.5 points Change in Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ) by 1 point Numerator Options: Performance Met: MID improvement demonstrated, increase in score by 3 points on the ACT OR Performance Met: MID improvement demonstrated, decrease in score by 0.5 points on the ACQ OR Performance Met: MID improvement demonstrated, decrease in score by 1 point on the ATAQ OR Medical Performance Exclusion: Medical reason(s) for patient not demonstrating MID improvement (eg, respiratory infection within 4 weeks of follow-up visit) OR Patient Performance Exclusion: Patient reasons for not demonstrating MID improvement (eg, patients with poor adherence to controller therapy as determined by self-report or pharmacy records (per cent of days covered < 50 %)) OR Performance Not Met: MID improvement NOT demonstrated, reason not otherwise specified RATIONALE: Current asthma guidelines recommend assessing an as thma patient's level of control and emphasize that the goal of asthma therapy is to achieve control. S everal validated asthma questionnaires can be used to assess control. In order to assess clinical improve ment or worsening of asthma control in an individua l or population overtime, the minimal important differen ce (MID) [also referred to as the minimal clinicall y important difference or MCID] can be used. The MID is defined as the smallest difference in score on t he instrument that represents a clinically significant change (Schatz 2009). Lack of asthma control impairs quality of life and is a risk factor for subsequent exacerbations. When control is not achieved, escalation of therapy is w arranted to attain and maintain control.

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The evidence statements are quoted verbat im from the referenced clinical guidelines: Once treatment is started, the results of the measu res of impairment and risk are used to monitor asth ma control rather than severity. Monitoring the level of asthma control is used to adjust medication as needed. 19 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Gu idelines Implementation Panel Report for: Expert Panel Report 3\u2014Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Man agement of Asthma, 2008. Bethesda, MD: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, US Dept of Health and Human Services; 2008. Four instruments have established cutoff values for uncontrolled versus controlled asthma: ACQ score o f 1.5 or greater, ACT score of 19 or less, ATAQ score of 1 or greater, and Childhood Asthma Control Test [cACT] score of 19 or less (US study). Two asthma control composite score instruments (AC Q and ACT) have been designated as core measures for the NIH-initiated clinical research in adults because of (1) the importance of asthma con trol as a goal of therapy; (2) extensive validation data for these instruments, using the widest range of criterion and construct measures and including demo nstration of responsiveness to therapy and an MCID; and (3) low patient burden and risk.

Measure Type: Process 38 Penicillin Allergy: Appropriate Removal or Confirma tion - National Quality Strategy Domain: Communication and Care Coordination DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients, regardless of age, with a p rimary diagnosis of penicillin or ampicillin/amoxic illin allergy, who underwent elective skin testing or ant ibiotic challenge that resulted in the removal of t he penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin allergy label from the medical record if negative or confirmation of the penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin allergy label if positive . INSTRUCTIONS: This outcomes measure is to be reported once per reporting period for all patients with a penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin allergy label in the medical record who are seen during the reporting period. P atients with a history of penicillin allergy without preced ing skin testing, in vitro testing or antibiotic ch allenge will qualify for the measure denominator. For the purpos es of this measure, a \"penicillin allergy\" will onl include natural ampicillin and amoxicillin. A discussion regardin g the risks and benefits of elective skin testing or penicillin challenge should take place with the patient or th eir caregiver/guardian. If the patient has previously d eclined skin testing or antibiotic challenge, they can be exempt from the measure numerator. In order to meet the numerator of this measure, skin testing or antibiotic challenge results should be reviewed and documented in the medical record. Further, the penicillin allergy label should be removed if resul ts are negative or confirmed if positive. This meas ure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quali ty actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific coding. Measure Reporting via Registry: ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, patient demog raphics, and medical record data are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. Medical record data and the listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the measure. DENOMINATOR: All patients, regardless of age, with a diagnosis o f primary penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin alle rgy seen during the reporting period Definition: Penicillin Allergy - For the purposes of this measure, a \"penicillin all ergy\" will only include a history of allergy to natural penicillins (penicill in G and penicillin V) OR aminopenicillins (ampicillin and amoxicillin). Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): All patients regardless of age AND Adverse effect of penicillins (ICD-10-CM): T36.0X5A, T36.0X5D, T36.0X5S Allergy status to penicillin who underwent elective skin testing or pen icillin challenge AND who had the penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin allergy label removed from t he medical record if results were negative or confi rmed in the medical record if results were positive. 39 NUMERATOR NOTE: A positive result consists of either a positive ski n test or positive challenge after a negative skin test. Numerator Options Performance Met: Patient underwent elective skin testing or penicill in challenge AND had the penicillin or ampicillin/amox icillin allergy label removed from the medical record if re sults were negative or confirmed in the medical record if results were positive OR Medical Performance Exclusion: Medical reason(s) for not documenting and reviewi ng (eg, previous positive penicillin skin test, patien ts with severe anaphylaxis to penicillin within the past 5 years, patients with penicillin reaction histories consist ent with severe non-IgE-mediated reactions, significant como rbid disease and patients unable to discontinue medicati ons with antihistaminic effects or beta-blockers) OR Patient Performance Exclusion: Patient reason(s) for not documenting and reviewi ng results (eg, patients who decline or are non-adhere nt with skin testing/challenge recommendations) OR Performance Not Met: Patient did NOT undergo elective skin testing/penicillin challenge and did not have the penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin allergy label removed or con firmed on the medical record, reason not otherwise specifi ed RATIONALE: Most patients with a diagnosis of penicillin allerg y are not allergic to penicillin. The avoidance of penicillin and related beta-lactam antibiotics may result in u se of antibiotics that are less effective, more cos tly or more toxic. Additionally, rapid penicillin desensit ization may be pursued unnecessarily, which also re sults in higher costs. In regards to exclusions, testing for penicillin re quires the ability to test without concomitant use of a medicine with antihistaminic effects. Severe non-Ig E-mediated penicillin reactions cannot be diagnosed via penicillin skin testing. Patients with significant comorbid diseases may be at higher risk of reaction due to skin testing and challenge. Also, should the pat ient be on a beta-blocker and unable to withhold be fore challenge this could be exclusion. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbat im from the referenced clinical guidelines: Summary Statement 54: The most useful test for dete cting IgE-mediated drug reactions caused by penicillin and many large-molecular-weight biologic als is immediate hypersensitivity skin testing. (B) Summary Statement 71: Approximately 10% of patients report a history of penicillin allergy, but after complete evaluation, up to 90% of these individuals are able to tolerate penicillins. (B) Summary Statement 72: Treatment of patients assumed to be penicillin allergic with alternate broad- spectrum antibiotics may compromise optimal medical care by leading to multiple drug-resistant organisms, higher costs, and increased toxic effect s. (C) Summary Statement 73: Evaluation of patients with p enicillin allergy by skin testing leads to reductio n in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and may decre ase costs.

Measure Type: Outcome 41 Adult Sinusitis: Antibiotic Prescribed for Acute Si nusitis (Appropriate Use) - National Quality Strategy Domain: Efficiency and Cost Reduction 2016 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: REGISTRY ONLY DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients, aged 18 years and older, wi th a diagnosis of acute sinusitis who were prescrib ed an antibiotic within 10 days after onset of symptom s INSTRUCTIONS: This measure is to be reported once for each occurrence for patients with acute sinusitis during the reporting period. This measure may be reported by c linicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. Measure Reporting via Registry: ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes and patient de mographics are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. The listed n umerator options are used to report the numerator o f the measure. The quality-data codes listed do not need to be sub mitted for registry-based submissions; however, the se codes may be submitted for those registries that ut ilize claims data. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnos is of acute sinusitis Definitions: Acute Sinusitis/Rhinosinusitis- Up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage (anterior, posterior, or both) accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain -pressure-fullness, or both: Purulent nasal discharge is cloudy or colored, in c ontrast to the clear secretions that typically accompany viral upper respiratory infection, and ma y be reported by the patient or observed on physical examination. Nasal obstruction may be repo rted by the patient as nasal obstruction, congestion, blockage, or stuffiness, or may be diag nosed by physical examination Facial pain-pressure-fullness may involve the anter ior face, periorbital region, or manifest with headache that is localized or diffuse Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 18 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis for antibiotic within 10 days a fter onset of symptoms Numerator Instructions: INVERSE MEASURE - A lower calculated performance rate for this measu re indicates better clinical care or control. The \"Performance Not Met\" numerator option for this measure is the representation of the better clinical quality or co ntrol. Reporting that numerator option will produce a performance rate that trends closer to 0%, as qua lity increases. For inverse measures a rate of 42 100% means all of the denominator eligible patients did not receive the appropriate care or were not in proper control, and therefore an inverse mea sure at 100% does not qualify for reporting purposes, however any reporting rate less than 100% does qualify. Numerator Options: Performance Met: Antibiotic regimen prescribed within 10 days after onset of symptoms (G9286) OR Other Performance Exclusion : Antibiotic regimen prescribed within 10 days aft er onset of symptoms for documented medical reason (G9505) OR Performance Not Met: Antibiotic regimen not prescribed within 10 after onset of symptoms (G9287) RATIONALE: Antibiotic treatment for sinusitis is indicated for some patients, but overtreatment of acute sinusiti s with antibiotics is common and often not indicated. Furt her, treatment with antibiotics may increase patien t harm and can lead to antibiotic resistance. A 2012 Cochrane systematic review was undertaken to assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings. Acute rhinosinusitis is a common conditi on that involves blockage of the nose passage and mucus in the sinuses. It is often caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection of which only 0.5% to 2 % of cases are estimated to be complicated by a bacterial rhinosinusitis. Nevertheless, antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections) are often pre scribed. Unnecessary prescribing contributes to antimicrobia l resistance in the community. The authors conclude d that given the lack of clear benefit in terms of ra pid recovery and the increase in side effects in participants treated with antibiotics, antibiotics are not recommended as first line treatment in adul ts with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbat im from the referenced clinical guidelines: AAO-HNS Sinusitis Guideline (2015) Clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacter ial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and no n-infectious conditions. A clinician should diagnos e ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinus itis (purulent nasal drainage accompanies by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both ) persist without evidence of improvement for at le ast 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms , or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). Strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies w ith minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm . The purpose of this statement is to emphasize the i mportance of differentiating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis (AR S) caused by viral upper respiratory infections to prevent unnecessary treatment with antibiotics. Dis tinguishing presumed bacterial vs. viral infection is important because antibiotic therapy is inappropria te for the latter. A quality improvement opportunity addressed by this guideline key action statement is the avoidance of inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections. More than one in five antibiotics pres cribed in adults are for sinusitis, making it the fifth mo st common diagnosis responsible for antibiotic ther apy.

DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnos is of acute bacterial sinusitis who are prescribed an antibiotic. Definitions: Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS) - Acute rhinosinusitis that is caused by, or is presu med to be caused by, bacterial infection. A clinician s hould diagnose ABRS when: (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days o r more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosi nusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening) Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 18 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis for to be caused by, b acterial infection: G9364 AND Antibiotic regimen prescribed: G9498 NUMERATOR: were prescribed amoxicillin, with or w ithout clavulanate, as a first line antibiotic at t he time of diagnosis 45 Numerator Options: Performance Met: Amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, prescribe d as a first line antibiotic at the time of diagnosis (G9315) OR Other Performance Exclusion: Amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, not presc ribed as first line antibiotic at the time of diagnosis f or documented reason (eg, cystic fibrosis, immotile ci lia disorders, ciliary dyskinesia, immune deficiency, p rior history of sinus surgery within the past 12 months, and anatomic abnormalities, such as deviated nasal sept um, resistant organisms, allergy to medication, recurre nt sinusitis, chronic sinusitis, or other reasons) (G9313) OR Performance Not Met: Amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, not prescribed as first line antibiotic at the time of diagnosis, reason not given (G9314) RATIONALE: The rationale for antibiotic therapy of ABRS is to eradicate bacterial infection from the sinuses, has ten resolution of symptoms, and enhance disease-specifi c quality of life. Antibiotic therapy should be efficacious, cost-effective, and result in minimal side effects. The justification for amoxicillin as first-line the rapy for most patients with ABRS relates to its saf ety, efficacy, low cost, and narrow microbiologic spectr um. Consideration to prescribing amoxicillin- clavulanate for adults with ABRS is given to those at a high risk of being infected by an organism res istant to amoxicillin. Factors that would prompt clinician s to consider prescribing amoxicillin-clavulanate i nstead of amoxicillin include: Situations in which bacterial resistance is likely (e.g. antibiotic use in the past month; close contact with treated individuals, health care provi ders, or a health care environment; failure of prior antibiotic therapy; breakthrough infection de spite prophylaxis; close contact with a child in a daycare facility; smoker or smoker in the family; h igh prevalence of resistant bacteria in community) Presence of moderate to severe infection (e.g. mod erate to severe symptoms of ABRS; protracted symptoms of ABRS; frontal or sphenoidal sinusitis, history of recurrent ABRS) Presence of comorbidity or extremes of life (e.g. comorbid conditions including diabetes; chronic cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease; immunocompromis ed patient; age greater than 65 years) The use of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate i s recommended for adults with ABRS who are at a hig h risk of being infected with an amoxicillin-resistan t organism. High-dose amoxicillin is preferred over standard-dose amoxicillin to cover penici llin non susceptible (PNS) S. pneumoniae. This risk exists in those from geographic regions with high e ndemic rates (>10%) of invasive PNS S. pneumoniae, those with severe infection (e.g., evidence of syst emic toxicity with fever of 39C (102F) or higher, a nd threat of supportive complications), age >65 years, recent hospitalization, antibiotic use within the past month, or those who are immunocompromised. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbat im from the referenced clinical guidelines: AAO-HNS Sinusitis Guideline (2015) If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibio tic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicill in with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for mo st adults. Recommendation based on randomized controlled trial s with heterogeneity and non-inferiority design wit h a preponderance of benefit over harm. 46 The purpose of this statement is to promote prescri bing of antibiotics with known efficacy and safety for ABRS and to reduce prescribing of antibiotics with potentially inferior efficacy because of more limit ed coverage of the usual pathogens that cause ABRS in adults. A secondary goal is to promote cost- effective antibiotic therapy for ABRS. A quality im provement opportunity addressed by this guideline k ey action statement is discouraging initial prescribin g of antibiotics other than amoxicillin, with or wi thout clavulanate, that may have low efficacy or have com parable efficacy but more adverse events. IDSA Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Bacteria l Rhinosinusitis in Children and Adults (2012) Amoxicillin-clavulanate rather than amoxicillin alo ne is recommended as empiric antimicrobial therapy for ABRS in adults (weak, low). Evidence for at least 1 critical outcome from obser vational studies, from RCTs with serious flaws or indirect evidence.

Numerator Options: Performance Met: CT scan of the paranasal sinuses ordered at the tim e of diagnosis or received within 28 days after date of diagnosis (G9349) OR Other Performance Exclusion: CT scan of the paranasal sinuses ordered at the tim e of diagnosis for documented reasons (eg, persons with sinusitis symptoms lasting at least 7 to 10 days, antibiotic resistance, immunocompromised, recurrent sinusitis, acute frontal sinusitis, acute sphenoid sinusitis, medical) Met: CT scan of the paranasal sinuses not ordered at the time of diagnosis or received within 28 days after date of diagnosis (G9350) RATIONALE: Most cases of uncomplicated acute and subacute sinu sitis are diagnosed clinically and should not requi re any imaging procedure. Sinus CT scanning is of limi ted value in the routine evaluation of sinusitis du e to the high prevalence of abnormal imaging findings. F orty percent of asymptomatic patients and 87 percen t of patients with community-acquired colds have sinu s abnormalities on sinus CT. Additionally, sinus CT imaging has a high sensitivity but a low specificit y for demonstrating acute sinusitis. Furthermore, C T imaging is not recommended for the diagnosis of unc omplicated sinusitis because it is not cost-effecti ve and exposes patients to unnecessary radiation. Sinusitis cannot be diagnosed on the basis of imagi ng findings alone. Findings on CT scans should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and endosc opic findings. Up to 40% of asymptomatic adults hav e abnormalities on sinus CT scans, as do more than 80 % of those with minor upper respiratory tract infections. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbat im from the referenced clinical guidelines: AAO-HNS Sinusitis Guideline (2015) Clinicians should not obtain radiographic imaging f or patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternativ e diagnosis is suspected. Recommendation (against imaging) based on diagnosti c studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm for not obtainin g imaging. The purpose of this statement is to emphasize that clinicians should not obtain radiographic imaging f or patients presenting with uncomplicated acute rhinos inusitis (ARS) to distinguish ABRS from VRS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspecte d. Radiographic imaging of the paranasal sinuses is un necessary for diagnosis in patients who already mee t clinical diagnostic criteria (Table 4) for ABRS. Si nus involvement is common in documented viral URIs, making it impossible to distinguish ABRS from VRS b ased solely on imaging studies. Moreover, clinical criteria may have a comparable diagnostic accuracy to sinus radiography, and radiography is not cost- effective regardless of baseline sinusitis prevalen ce. When a complication of ABRS or an alternative diagn osis is suspected, imaging studies may be obtained. Complications of ABRS include orbital, intracranial , or soft tissue involvement. Alternative diagnoses include malignancy and other non-infectious causes of facial pain. Radiographic imaging may also be 49 obtained when the patient has modifying factors or comorbidities that predispose to complications, including diabetes, immune compromised state, or a past history of facial trauma or surgery. A quality improvement opportunity addressed by this guideline key action statement is avoiding costly diagnostic tests that do not improve diagnostic acc uracy yet expose the patient to unnecessary radiati on.

Numerator Options: Performance Met: More than one CT scan of the paranasal sinuses ordered or received within 90 days after the date o f diagnosis, reason not given (G9352) OR Other Performance Exclusion: More than one CT scan of the paranasal sinuses ordered or received within 90 days after the date o f diagnosis for documented reasons (eg, patients with complications, second CT obtained prior to surgery, other medical reasons) (G9353) OR Performance Not Met: One CT scan or no CT scan of the paranasal sinuses ordered within 90 days after the date of diagnosis (G9354) RATIONALE: Computerized tomography scanning is expensive, expo ses the patient to ionizing radiation and offers no additional information that would improve initial m anagement. Multiple CT scans within 90 days may be appropriate in patients with complicated sinusitis or where an alternative diagnosis is suspected. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbat im from the referenced clinical guidelines: AAO-HNS Sinusitis Guideline (2015) The clinician should confirm a clinical diagnosis o f CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anter ior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. Strong recommendation based on cross-sectional stud ies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The purpose of this statement is to strongly emphas ize that a diagnosis of CRS cannot be based on sign s and symptoms alone, but also requires objective evi dence of sinonasal inflammation. Objective confirmation of sinonasal inflammation may be made by direct visualization or by computed tomography (CT) scanning. Nasal endoscopy and CT scanning both have a much higher diagnostic accuracy, but CT scanning includes the small associated risk of radi ation exposure, while nasal endoscopy includes an added cost. CT scanning can help quantify the extent of inflamm atory disease based upon opacification of the paranasal sinuses, and improves diagnostic accuracy because CT imaging findings correlate with the presence or absence of CRS in patients with suggest ive clinical symptoms.

Performance Not Met: 4040F with 8P: Pneumococcal vaccine was not administered or previously received, reason not otherwise specified RATIONALE: Pneumonia is a common cause of illness and death in the elderly and persons with certain underlying conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, asthma, sickle cell anemia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (NHLBI, 2011). In 199 8, an estimated 3,400 adults aged > 65 years died as a result of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (CDC, 2003). Among the 91.5 million US adults aged > 50 years, 2 9,500 cases of IPD, 502,600 cases of nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 25,400 pne umococcal-related deaths are estimated to occur yearly; annual direct and indirect costs are estimated to total $3.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Pneumococcal disease remains a substa ntial burden among older US adults, despite increased coverage with 23-valent pneumococcal poly saccharide vaccine, (PPV23) and indirect benefits afforded by PCV7 vaccination of young children (Wey cker, et al., 2011). Vaccination has been found to be effective against bacteremic cases (OR: 0.34; -0.86). Vaccine effectiveness vaccine types (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.09-0.66) (Vila-Corcoles, et al., 2009). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' ( ACIP) released recommendations in September, 2014, describing the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among adults aged 65 Years. According to the ACIP, both the PCV13 and PPSV23 should be administered ro utinely in series to all adults aged 65 years. Adults aged 65 years with no previous history or an unknown his tory of pneumococcal vaccination should receive PCV13 before PPSV23. Adults aged 65 years with a history of PPSV23 should receive PCV13, after which a second dose of PPSV23 may be a dministered for those adults with an indication for two doses of PPSV23.

However, interruptions in the continuity of care an d information gaps in patient health records are common and significantly affect patient outcomes. C onsequently, clinical judgments may be based on incomplete, inaccurate, poorly documented or unavai lable information about the patient and his or her medication. As identified by The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in the National Healthcare Disparities report (2013), \"different providers may prescribe m edications for the same patient. Patients are responsible for keeping track of all their medicati ons, but medication information can be confusing, especially for patients on multiple medications. Wh en care is not well coordinated and some providers do not know about all of a patient's medications, pati ents are at greater risk for adverse events related to drug interactions, overdosing, or underdosing.\" 62 In addition, providers need to periodically review all of a patient's medications to ensure that they are taking what is needed and only what is needed. Medi cation reconciliation has been shown to reduce both medication errors and adverse drug events (Whitting ton & Cohen, 2004). Medication safety efforts have primarily focused on hospitals; however, the majority of health care services are provided in the outpatient setting whe re two-thirds of physician visits result in writing at least one prescription (Stock et al., 2009). Chronically ill patients are increasingly being treated as outp atients, many of whom take multiple medications requiring cl ose monitoring (Nassaralla et al., 2007). Adverse drug events (ADEs) prove to be more fatal i n outpatient settings (1 of 131 outpatient deaths) than in hospitals (1 of 854 inpatient deaths) (Nass aralla et al., 2007). According to the first study to utilize nationally-representative data to examine annual ra tes of ADEs in the ambulatory care setting \"Adverse Drug events in U.S. Adult Ambulatory Medical Care,\" ADE rates increase with age, adults 25-44 years ol d had a rate of 1.3 per 10,000 person per year, those 45-64 had a rate of 2.2 per 10,000 per year, and those 65 years and older had the highest rate, at 3 .8 ADEs per 10,000 persons per year. This study estimates that 13.5 million ADE related visits occu rred between 2005-2007, estimating that approximate ly 4.5 million ambulatory ADE visits occur each year. These 4.5 million visits are associated with approximately 400,000 hospitalizations annually. Ac cording to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), in the US, as many as 98,000 deaths per year are attributable to preventable adverse events that occur in the hospitals setting with annual costs of between $17 billion and $29 billion. (Sarkar et al., 2011) Additionally, findings of The Commonwealth Fund (20 10) studies identified 11% to 28% of the 4.3 millio n visit related ADEs (VADE) in 2001 might have been p revented with improved systems of care and better patient education, yielding an estimate of 473,000 to 1.2 million potentially preventable VADEs annual ly and potential cost-savings of $946 million to $2.4 billion. According to the AMA's published report, The Physic ian's Role in Medication Reconciliation, the rate o f medication errors during hospitalization was estima ted to be 52 per 100 admissions, or 70 per 1,000 patient days in 2005. Emerging research suggests th e scope of medication-related errors in ambulatory settings is as extensive as or more extensive than during hospitalization. Ambulatory visits result in a prescription for medication 50 to 70% of the time. One study estimated the rate of ADEs in the ambulat ory setting to be 27 per 100 patients. It is estimated that between 2004 and 2005, in the United States 701,547 patients were treated for ADEs in emergency departments and 117,318 patients were hospitalized for injuries caused by an ADE. Individ uals aged 65 years and older are more likely than a ny other population group to require treatment in the emergency department for ADEs. (AMA, 2007). A Systematic Review on Prevalence of Adverse Drug Events in Ambulatory Car e finds that \"In the ambulatory care setting, adverse drug events (ADEs) have been reported to occur at a rate of 25%. Approximately 39% of these ADEs were preventable. S ince many ADEs are associated with medication errors, and thus potentially preventable, understan ding the nature of medication errors in ambulatory care settings can direct attention toward improvement of medication safety in ambulatory care.\" Data extrac ted and synthesized across studies indicated the median preventable ADE rates in ambulatory care-based studies were 16.5%. (Tache et al., 2011). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (A HRQ) The National Healthcare Disparities Report (2011) identified the rate of adverse drug events ( ADE) among Medicare beneficiaries in ambulatory settings as 50 per 1,000 person-years. In 2005, AHR Q reported data on adults age 65 and over who received potentially inappropriate prescription med icines in the calendar year, by race, ethnicity, in come, education, insurance status, and gender. The dispar ities were identified as follows: older Asians were more likely than older whites to have inappropriate drug use (20.3% compared with 17.3%); older Hispanics were less likely than older non-Hispanic Whites to have inappropriate drug use (13.5% compared with 17.6%); older women were more likely than older men to have inappropriate drug use (20.2% compared with 14.3%); there were no statisti cally significant differences by income or educatio n. Weeks et al. (2010) noted that fragmented medicatio n records across the health care continuum, inaccurate reporting of medication regimens by pati ents, and provider failure to acquire all of the necessary elements of medication information from t he patient or record, present significant obstacles to obtaining an accurate medication list in the ambula tory care setting. Because these obstacles require 63 solutions demonstrating improvements in access to i nformation and communication, the Institute of Medicine and others have encouraged the incorporati on of IT solutions in the medication reconciliation process. In a survey administered to office-based p hysicians with high rates of EMR use, Weeks, et al found there is an opportunity for universal medicat ion lists utilizing health IT. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The Joint Commission's 2015 Ambulatory Care Nationa l Patient Safety Goals guide providers to maintain and communicate accurate patient medication informa tion. Specifically, the section \"Use Medicines Safely NPSG.03.06.01\" states the following: \"Mainta in and communicate accurate patient medication information. The types of information that clinicia ns use to reconcile medications include (among othe rs) medication name, dose, frequency, route, and purpos e. Organizations should identify the information th at needs to be collected to reconcile current and newl y ordered medications and to safely prescribe medications in the future.\" (Joint Commission, 2015 , retrieved at: National Patient Safety Goals Effec tive January 1, 2015). The National Quality Forum's 2010 update of the Saf e Practices for Better Healthcare, states healthcar e organizations must develop, reconcile, and communic ate an accurate patient medication list throughout the continuum of care. Improving the safety of heal thcare delivery saves lives, helps avoid unnecessar y complications, and increases the confidence that re ceiving medical care actually makes patients better , not worse. Every healthcare stakeholder group shoul d insist that provider organizations demonstrate th eir commitment to reducing healthcare error and improvi ng safety by putting into place evidence-based safe practices. The AMA's published report, The Physician's Role in Medication Reconciliation , identified the best practice medication reconciliation team as one that is multidisciplinary and\u2014in all settings of care\u2014w ill include physicians, pharmacists, nurses, ancillary health care professionals and clerical staff. The t eam's variable requisite knowledge, skills, experiences, and perspectives are needed to make medication reconciliation work as safely and smoothly as possi ble. Team members may have access to vital information or data needed to optimize medication s afety. Because physicians are ultimately responsibl e for the medication reconciliation process and subse quently accountable for medication management, physician leadership and involvement in all phases of developing and initiating a medication reconcili ation process or model is important to its success.

Performance Met for G8417 & G8418 o If the provider documents a BMI and a follow-up pl an at the current visit OR o If the patient has a documented BMI within the pre vious six months of the current encounter, the provider documents a follow-up plan at the current visit OR o If the patient has a documented BMI within the pre vious six months of the current encounter AND the patient has a documented follow-up plan for a BMI outside normal parameters within the previous six months of the current visit Definitions: BMI - Body mass index (BMI), is a number calculated us ing the Quetelet index: weight divided by height squared (W/H2) and is commonly us ed to classify weight categories. BMI can be calculated using: Metric Units: BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m) x He ight (m)) OR English Units: BMI = Weight (lbs) / (Height (in) x Height (in)) x 703 Follow-Up Plan - Proposed outline of treatment to be conducted as a result of a BMI out of normal parameters. A follow-up plan may inclu de, but is not limited to: Documentation of education Referral (for example a registered dietitian, nutr itionist, occupational therapist, physical therapist, primary care provider, exercise physiolo gist, mental health professional, or surgeon) Pharmacological interventions Dietary supplements Exercise counseling Nutrition counseling Not Eligible for BMI Calculation or Follow-Up Plan - A patient is not eligible if one or more of the following reasons are documented: Patient is receiving palliative care Patient is pregnant Patient refuses BMI measurement (refuses height an d/or weight) Any other reason documented in the medical record by the provider why BMI measurement was not appropriate 66 Patient is in an urgent or emergent medical situat ion where time is of the essence, and to delay treatment would jeopardize the patient's heal th status Numerator Quality-Data Coding Options for Reporting Satisfactorily: BMI Documented as Normal, No Follow-Up Plan Require d (One quality-data code [G8417, G8418 or G8420] is required on the claim form to submit this numerator option) Performance Met: G8420: BMI is documented within normal parameters and no follow-up plan is required OR BMI Documented as Above Normal Parameters, AND Fo llow-Up Documented Performance Met: G8417: BMI is documented above normal parameters and a follow-up plan is documented OR BMI Documented as Below Normal Parameters, AND Fo llow-Up Documented Performance Met: G8418: BMI is documented below normal parameters and a follow-up plan is documented OR BMI not Documented, Patient not Eligible (One quality-data code [G8422 or G8938] is required on the claim form to submit this numerator option) Other Performance Exclusion: G8422: BMI not documented, documentation the patient is not eligible for BMI calculation OR BMI Documented Outside of Normal Limits, Follow-up Plan not Documented, Patient not Eligible Other Performance Exclusion: G8938: BMI is documented as being outside of normal limits, follow-up plan is not documented, documentation the patient is not eligible OR BMI not Documented, Reason not Given (One quality-data code [G8419 or G8421] is requir ed on the claim form to submit this numerator option) Performance Not Met: G8421: BMI not documented and no reason is given OR BMI Documented Outside of Normal Parameters, Follow -Up Plan not Documented, Reason not Given Performance Not Met: G8419: BMI documented outside normal parameters, no follow-up plan documented, no reason given RATIONALE: Normal Parameters for Age 65 Years and Older Winter et al. (2014) performed a meta-analysis look ing at the relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality among adults 65 and older. They identifie d a higher risk of mortality among those with a BMI <23 kg/m2 and recommended monitoring weight status in this group to address any modifiable causes of weight loss promptly with due consideration of indi vidual comorbidities. Dahl et al. (2013) reported t hat old persons (70-79) who were overweight had a lower mortality risk than old persons who were of normal weight, even after controlling for weight change an d multimorbidity. The study also shows that persons who increased or decreased in BMI had a greater mor tality risk than those who had a stable BMI, particularly those aged 70 to 79. Their results pro vide support to the belief that the World Health Organization guidelines for BMI are overly restrict ive in old age. BMI Above Upper Parameters Obesity continues to be a costly public health conc ern in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2010) reported in 2009 , no state met the Healthy People 2010 obesity target of 15 percent and the self-reported overall prevalence of obesity among adults had increased 1. 1 67 percentage points in 2007 to 26.7 percent (2010).Og den, Carroll, Kit and Flegal (2013) reported the prevalence of BMI-defined obesity in adults is high and continues to exceed 30% in most sex-age groups (34.9% overall). They also stated the overall preva lence of obesity did not differ between men and wom en in 2011-2012; however, among non-Hispanic black adu lts, 56.6% of women were obese compared with 37.1% of men. In addition to the continued high pre valence rate for adults in general, Flegal, Carroll & Kit (2012) report a significant increase for men and fo r non-Hispanic black and Mexican American women over the 12-year period from 1999 through 2010 (201 2). Moyer (2012) reported: Obesity is associated with such health problems as an increased risk for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, various t ypes of cancer, gallstones and disability. These comorbi d medical conditions are associated with higher use of health care services and costs among obese patients (p. 373). Obesity is also associated with an increased risk o f death, particularly in adults younger than age 65 years and has been shown to reduce life expectancy by 6 to 20 years depending on age and race (LeBlanc et al., 2011). Masters, et al. (2013) also showed mortality due to obesity varied by race and gender. They estimated adult deaths between 1986 an d 2006 associated with overweight and obesity was 5.0% and 15.6% for Black and White men, and 26. 8% and 21.7% for Black and White women, respectively. They also found a stronger associatio n than previous research demonstrated between obesity and mortality risk at older ages. Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen and Dietz (2009) found that in 2006, across all payers, per capita medical spending for the obese is $1,429 higher per year, ( 42 percent) than for someone of normal weight. Usin g 2008 dollars, this was estimated to be equivalent t o $147 billion dollars in medical care costs relate d to obesity. Padula, Allen and Nair (2014) examined data from a commercial claims and encounters database to estimate the cost for obesity and associated comorb idities among working-age adults who had a claim with a primary or secondary diagnosis of obesity in 2006-2007. The mean net expenditure for inpatient and outpatient claims was $1,907 per patient per vi sit. The increases in cost for comorbidities ranged from $527 for obesity with CHF to $15,733 for the c ombination of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertens ion and depression. In addition to a high prevalence rate of obesity, l ess than 50% of obese adults in 2010 received advic e to exercise or perform physical activity (Barnes & Sch oenborn, 2012). BMI Below Normal Parameters In the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Health E-Stat, Fryer and Ogden (2012) reported tha t poor nutrition or underlying health conditions can result in underweight. Results from the 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N HANES), using measured heights and weights, indicate an estimated 1.7% of U.S. adults are under weight with women more likely to be underweight than men (2012). In a cohort study conducted by Borrell and Lalitha (2014), data from NHANES III (1988-1994) was linked to the National Death Index mortality file with fol low-up to 2006, and showed that when compared to th eir normal weight counterparts (BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2), und erweight (BMI (Hazard Ratio= 2.27; 95% confidence int erval (CI) = 1.78, 2.90). Ranhoff, Gjoen and Mowe (2005) recommended using BM I < 23 kg/m2 for the elderly to identify positive results with malnutrition screens and poor nutritio nal status. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Although multiple clinical recommendations addressi ng obesity have been developed by professional organizations, societies and associations, two reco mmendations have been identified which exemplify th e intent of the measure and address the numerator and denominator. 68 The US Preventive Health Services Task Force (USPST F) recommends screening all adults (aged 18 years and older) for obesity. Clinicians should off er or refer patients with a BMI of 30 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions. This is a B recommendation (Moyer, 2012). As cited in Wilkinson et al. (2013), Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) Preventive Serv ices for Adults, Obesity Screening (Level II) Recommenda tion provides the following guidance: Record height, weight and calculate body mass inde x at least annually o Clinicians should consider waist circumference mea surement to estimate disease risk for patients who have BMI scores indicative of overweig ht or obesity class I. For adult patients with a BMI of 25 to 34.9 kg/m2, sex-specif ic waist circumference cutoffs should be used in conjunction with BMI to identify increas ed disease risk. o A BMI greater or equal to 30 is defined as obese o A BMI of 25-29 is defined as overweight o Intensive intervention for obese individuals, base d on BMI, is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services to help control weight. Similarly, the 2013 joint report/guideline from the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology and The Obesity Society also recommend m easuring height and weight and calculating BMI at annual visits or more frequently, using the curr ent cutpoints for overweight (BMI>25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI 30 kg/m2) to identify adults who may be at elevated risk of CVD and the current cutpoints for obesity to identify adults who may be at elevat ed risk of mortality from all causes. They also recommend counseling overweight and obese individua ls on their increased risk for CVD, type 2 diabetes, all-cause mortality and need for lifestyl e changes.

Measure Type: Process 69 Measure #110 (NQF 0041, e-CQM CMS 147v5): Influenza Immunization - National Quality Strategy Domain: Community/Population Health 2016 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: CLAIMS, REGISTRY DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients aged 6 months and older seen for a visit between October 1 and March 31 who received an influenza immunization OR who reported previous receipt of an influenza immunization INSTRUCTIONS: This measure is to be reported a minimum of once fo r visits for patients seen between January and March for the 2015-2016 influenza season AND a mini mum of once for visits for patients seen between October and December for the 2016-2017 influenza se ason. This measure is intended to determine whether or not all patients aged 6 months and older received (either from the reporting physician or f rom an alternate care provider) the influenza immunizat ion during the flu season. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may be r eported by clinicians who perform the quality actio ns described in the measure based on the services prov ided and the measure-specific denominator coding. If reporting this measure between January 1, 2016 a nd March 31, 2016, quality-data code G8482 should be reported when the influenza immunization is admi nistered to the patient during the months of August , September, October, November, and December of 2015 or January, February, and March of 2016 for the flu season ending March 31, 2016. If reporting this measure between October 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016, quality-data code G8482 should be reported when the influenza immunization is administered to the patient during the months of August, September, October, November, and December of 2016 for the flu season ending March 31, 2017. Influenza immunizations administered during the mo nth of August or September of a given flu season (either 2015-2016 flu season OR 2016-2017 fl u season) can be reported when a visit occurs during the flu season (October 1 - March 31) . In these cases, G8482 should be reported. Measure Reporting via Claims: CPT or HCPCS codes and patient demographics are use d to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. Quality-data codes are used to report the numerator of the measure. When reporting the measure via claims, submit the l isted CPT or HCPCS codes, and the appropriate numerator quality-data code. All measure-specific c oding should be reported on the claim(s) representi ng the eligible encounter. Measure Reporting via Registry: CPT or HCPCS codes and patient demographics are use d to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the measure. The quality-data codes listed do not need to be sub mitted for registry-based submissions; however, the se codes may be submitted for those registries that ut ilize claims data. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 6 months and older seen for a vis it between October 1 and March 31 Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 6 months seen for a visit between October 1 and Ma rch 31 AND Patient encounter during the reporting period who received an influenza immunization OR who reported previous receipt of an influenza immunization Numerator Instructions: The numerator for this measure can be met by repor ting either administration of an influenza vaccination or that the patient reported previous receipt of the current season's influenza immunization. If the performance of the numerator is not met, a clinician can report a valid performance exclusion for having not administered an influenza vaccination. For clinicians reporting a performance exclusion for this measure , there should be a clear rationale and documented reason for not administering an influen za immunization if the patient did not indicate previous receipt, which could include a medical re ason (e.g., patient allergy), patient reason (e.g., patient declined), or system reason (e.g., vaccina tion not available). The system reason should be indicated only for cases of disruption or short age of influenza vaccination supply. Definition: Previous Receipt - Receipt of the current season's influenza immuni zation from another provider OR from same provider prior to the visit to which the measure is applied (typically, prior vaccination would include influenza vaccine given since August 1st). Numerator Quality-Data Coding Options for Reporting Satisfactorily: Influenza Immunization Administered Performance Met: G8482: Influenza immunization administered or previously received OR Influenza Immunization not Administered for Documen ted Reasons Other Performance Exclusion: G8483: Influenza immunization was not administered for reasons documented by clinician (e.g., patie nt allergy or other medical reasons, patient declined or other patient reasons, vaccine n ot available or other system reasons) OR Influenza Immunization not Administered, Reason not Given Performance Not Met: G8484: Influenza immunization as not administered, reason not given RATIONALE: Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective method for preventing influenza virus infection and its complications. Influenza vaccine is recommended for all persons aged 6 months who do not have contraindications to vaccination. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbat im from the referenced clinical guidelines. Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged >=6 months who do not have contraindications. Vaccination optimally should occ ur before onset of influenza activity in the commun ity. Health care providers should offer vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available (by October, if possible). Vaccination should be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating.

Measure Type: Process 72 Measure #65 (NQF 0069, e-CQM CMS 154v4): Appropriat e Treatment for Children with Upper Respiratory Infection (URI) - National Quality Stra tegy Domain: Efficiency and Cost Reduction 2016 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: REGISTRY ONLY DESCRIPTION: Percentage of children 3 months through 18 years of age who were diagnosed with upper respiratory infection (URI) and were not dispensed an antibioti c prescription on or three days after the episode INSTRUCTIONS : This measure is to be reported once for each occurr ence of upper respiratory infection during the reporting period. Claims data will be analyzed to determine unique oc currences. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions describe d in the measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. Measure Reporting via Registry: ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT or HCPCS codes, and patient demographics are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denomina tor. The listed numerator options are used to repor t the numerator of the measure. The quality-data codes listed do not need to be sub mitted for registry-based submissions; however, the se codes may be submitted for those registries that ut ilize claims data. DENOMINATOR : Children 3 months through 18 years of age who had a n outpatient or emergency department (ED) visit with only a diagnosis of upper respiratory infectio n (URI) during the measurement period Denominator Instructions: To determine eligibility, look for any of the list ed antibiotic drugs below in the 30 days prior to the visit with the URI diagnosis. As long as there are no prescriptions for the listed antibiotics during th is time period, the patient is eligible for denominator inclusion. Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 3 months through 18 years on date of encounter AND Diagnosis for URI (ICD-10-CM): J00, J06.0, J06.9 AND Patient encounter not prescribed or dispensed a pre scription for antibiotic medication on or within 3 days after the URI Episode date Numerator Instructions: For performance, the measure will be calculated as the number of patient's encounter(s) where antibiotics were neit her prescribed nor dispensed on or within three days of the episode for URI over the total number of encounters in the denominator (patients aged 3 months through 18 years with an outpatient or ED visit for URI. A higher score indicates appropriate treatment of patients with URI (e.g., the proportion for whom antibiotics were not prescribed or dispensed following the episode). Table 1 - Antibiotic Medications Description Prescr iption 73 Numerator Options: Performance Met: Patient not prescribed or dispensed antibiotic (G8708) OR Medical Performance Exclusion : Patient prescribed or dispensed antibiotic for documented medical reason(s) (e.g., intestina l infection, pertussis, bacterial infection, Lyme disease, otitis media, acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, ac ute infection of ydia, inflammatory diseases [female reproductive or gans]), infections of the kidney, cystitis or UTI, an d acne (G8709) OR 74 Performance Not Met: Patient prescribed or dispensed antibiotic (G8710) RATIONALE: In 1998, 25 million patients (adults and children) sought care for non-specific upper respiratory infe ctions (URI, also known as the common cold) and 30 percent received antibiotics (Gonzales 2001). Inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for URI, pha ryngitis and bronchitis are estimated to amount to 55 percent (22.6 million) of all antibiotics prescribe d for acute respiratory infections, costing $726 mi llion in 1998 (Gonzales 2001). Using antibiotics inappropriately can lead to antib iotic resistance, which can result in increased mor bidity and mortality (Feikin 2000). The resulting increase d effort to treat drug-resistant pathogens can also lead to more repeated health care visits, greater risk o f disease complications and increased health care c osts (Feikin 2000; Dagan 2000; Watanabe 2000). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: American Family Physician (Wong, Blumberg, and Lowe 2006) A diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis shou ld be considered in patients with symptoms of a viral upper respiratory infection that have not imp roved after 10 days or that worsen after five to seven days. (C) Treatment of sinus infection with antibiotics in t he first week of symptoms is not recommended. (C) Telling patients not to fill an antibiotic prescri ption unless symptoms worsen or fail to improve after several days can reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics.

Measure Type: Process 75 Measure #374 (e-CQM CMS 50v4) Closing the Referral Loop: Receipt of Specialist Re port - National Quality Strategy Domain: Communication and Care Coordination 2016 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: EHR ONLY DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients with referrals, regardless o f age, for which the referring provider receives a report from the provider to whom the patient was referred. DENOMINATOR: Number of patients, regardless of age, who were ref erred by one provider to another provider, and who had a visit during the measurement period. NUMERATOR: Number of patients with a referral, for which the r eferring provider received a report from the provid er to whom the patient was referred. RATIONALE: Problems in the outpatient referral and consultatio n process have been documented, including lack of timeliness of information and inadequate provision of information between the specialist and the requesting physician (Gandhi, 2000; Forrest, 2000; Stille, 2005). In a study of physician satisfaction with the outpatient referral process, Gandhi et al. (200 0) found that 68% of specialists reported receiving no information from the primary care provider prior to referral visits, and 25% of primary care providers had still not received any information from specialists 4 weeks after referral visits. In another study of 963 referrals (Forrest, 2000), pediatricians scheduled appointments with specialists for only 39% and sent patient information to the specialists in only 51% of the time. In a 2006 report to Congress, MedPAC found that car e coordination programs improved quality of care for patients, reduced hospitalizations, and improve d adherence to evidence-based care guidelines, especially among patients with diabetes and CHD. As sociations with cost-savings were less clear; this was attributed to how well the intervention group w as chosen and defined, as well as the intervention put in place. Additionally, cost-savings were usually c alculated in the short-term, while some argue that the greatest cost-savings accrue over time (MedPAC, 200 6). Improved mechanisms for information exchange could facilitate communication between providers, whether for time-limited referrals or consultations , on-going co-management, or during care transition s. For example, a study by Branger et al. (1999) found that an electronic communication network that link ed the computer-based patient records of physicians wh o had shared care of patients with diabetes significantly increased frequency of communications between physicians and availability of important clinical data. There was a 3-fold increase in the l ikelihood that the specialist provided written communication of results if the primary care physic ian scheduled appointments and sent patient information to the specialist (Forrest, 2000). Care coordination is a focal point in the current h ealth care reform and our nation's ambulatory healt h information technology (HIT) framework. The Nationa l Priorities Partnership recently highlighted care coordination as one of the most critical areas for development of quality measurement and improvement (NPP, 2008).

Measure Type: Process 77 Measure #317 (e -CQM CMS 22v4) Preventive Care and Screening: Screening for High B lood Pressure and Follow-Up Documented - National Qualit y Strategy Domain: Community / Population Health 2016 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: CLAIMS, REGISTRY DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older seen during the reporting period who were screened for high blood pressure AND a recommended follow-up pla n is documented based on the current blood pressure (BP) reading as indicated INSTRUCTIONS: This measure is to be reported a minimum of once pe r reporting period for patients seen during the reporting period. Eligible professionals who report the measure must perform the blood pressure screening at the time of a qualifying visit and may not obtain measurements from external sources. This measure may be reported by eligible profession als who perform the quality actions described in th e measure based on the services provided and the meas ure-specific denominator coding. The intent of this measure is to screen patients for high blood pressu re and provide recommended follow-up as indicated. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure meas urements are required for inclusion. If there are multiple blood pressures on the same date of servic e, use the most recent as the representative blood pressure. The documented follow-up plan must be rel ated to the current BP reading as indicated, example: \"Patient referred to primary care provider for BP management\". Measure Reporting via Claims : CPT or HCPCS codes and patient demographics are use d to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. Quality-data codes are used to report the numerator of the measure. When reporting the measure via claims, submit the l isted CPT or HCPCS codes, and the appropriate quality-data code. All measure-specific coding shou ld be reported on the claim(s) representing the eli gible encounter. Measure Reporting via Registry: CPT or HCPCS codes and patient demographics are use d to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the measure. The quality-data codes listed do not need to be sub mitted for registry-based submissions; however, the se codes may be submitted for those registries that ut ilize claims data. DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 18 years and older Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 18 years AND Patient encounter during the reporting period (CPT who were screened for high blood pressure AND have a recommended follow-up plan documented, as indicated, if the blood pressure is pre-hypertensive or hypertensive NUMERATOR NOTE: Although the recommended screening interval for a normal BP reading is every 2 years, to meet the intent of this measure, BP screening and follow-up must be performed once per measurement period. For patients with Nor mal blood pressure a follow-up plan is not required. Definitions: Blood Pressure (BP) Classification - BP is defined by four (4) BP reading classificat ions: Normal, Pre-Hypertensive, First Hypertensive, and Second Hypertensive Readings. Recommended BP Follow-Up - The Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure ( JNC 7) recommends BP screening intervals, lifestyle modifications and interventions based on the current BP reading as listed in the \"Recommended Blood Pressure Follow-Up Intervention s\" listed below. Recommended Lifestyle Modifications - The JNC 7 report outlines lifestyle modification s which must include one or more of the following as indic ated: Weight Reduction Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Eat ing Plan Dietary Sodium Restriction Increased Physical Activity Moderation in alcohol (ETOH) Consumption Second Hypertensive Reading - Requires a BP reading of Systolic BP 140 mmHg OR Diastolic BP 90 mmHg during the current encounter AND a most re cent BP reading within the last 12 months Systolic BP 140 mmHg OR Diastolic BP 90 mmHg Second Hypertensive BP Reading Interventions - The JNC 7 report outlines BP follow-up interventions for a second hypertensive BP reading and must include one or more of the following as indicated: Anti-Hypertensive Pharmacologic Therapy Laboratory Tests Electrocardiogram (ECG) Recommended Blood Pressure Follow-up Interventions- Normal BP: No follow-up required for Systolic BP < 80 Pre-Hypertensive BP: Follow-up with rescreen every year with systolic BP of 120 - 139 mmHg OR diastolic BP of 80 - 89 mmHg AND recommende d lifestyle modifications OR referral to Alternate/Primary Care Provider First Hypertensive BP Reading: Patients with one e levated reading of systolic BP >= 140 mmHg >= 90 mmHg: o Follow-up with rescreen > 1 day and < 4 weeks AND recommend lifestyle modifications OR referral to Alternative/Primary Ca re Provider Second Hypertensive BP Reading: Patients with seco nd elevated reading diastolic BP >= 90 mmHg: o Follow-up with Recommended lifestyle modifications AND one or more of the Second Hypertensive Reading Interventions OR referr al to Alternative/Primary Care Provider 79 Recommended Blood Pressure Follow-Up Table Not Eligible - A patient is not eligible if one or more of the following reason(s) are documented: Patient has an active diagnosis of hypertension Patient refuses to participate (either BP measurem ent or follow-up) Patient is in an urgent or emergent situation wher e time is of the essence and to delay treatment would jeopardize the patient's health sta tus. This may include but is not limited to severely elevated BP when immediate medical trea tment is indicated Numerator Quality-Data Coding Options for Reportin g Satisfactorily: Normal Blood Pressure Reading Documented, Follow-Up not Required Performance Met: G8783 : Normal blood pressure reading documented, follo w-up not required OR 80 Pre-Hypertensive or Hypertensive Blood Pressure Rea ding Documented, AND Indicated Follow- Up Documented Performance Met: G8950: Pre-Hypertensive or Hypertensive blood pressure reading documented, AND the indicated follow- up is documented OR Patient not Eligible for measure Other Performance Exclusion: G8784: Patient not eligible (e.g., documentation the pati ent is not eligible due to active diagnosis of hyper tension, patient refuses, urgent or emergent situation , documentation the patient is not eligible) OR Blood Pressure Reading not Documented, Reason not G iven Performance Not Met: G8785: Blood pressure reading not documented, reason no t given OR Pre-Hypertensive or Hypertensive Blood Pressure Re ading Documented, Indicated Follow- Up not Documented, Reason not Given Performance Not Met: G8952: Pre-Hypertensive or Hypertensive blood pressure reading documented, indicated follow- follow-up not documented, reason not given RATIONALE: Hypertension is a prevalent condition that affects approximately 66.9 million people in the United Sta tes. It is estimated that about 20-40% of the adult popu lation has hypertension; the majority of people ove r age 65 have a hypertension diagnosis (Appleton SL, et. al., 2012 and Luehr D, et. al., 2012). Winter (2013) noted that 1 in 3 American adults have hyper tension and the lifetime risk of developing hypertension is 90% (Winter KH, et. al., 2013). The African American population or non-Hispanic Blacks , the elderly, diabetics and those with chronic kidne y disease are at increased risk of stroke, myocardi al infarction and renal disease. Non-Hispanic Blacks h ave the highest prevalence at 38.6% (Winter KH, et. al., 2013). Hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrop hy, renal failure, stroke and dementia (Luehr D, et. al ., 2012). Hypertension is the most common reason for adult of fice visits other than pregnancy. Garrison (2013) stated that in 2007, 42 million ambulatory visits w ere attributed to hypertension (Garrison GM and Oberhelman S, 2013). It also has the highest utiliz ation of prescription drugs. Numerous resources and treatment options are available, yet only about 40- 50% of the hypertensive patients have their blood pressure under control (<140/90) (Appleton SL, et. al., 2012, Luehr D, et. al., 2012). In addition to medication non-compliance, poor outcomes are also a ttributed to poor adherence to lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased e xercise and limiting alcohol intake. Many adults fi nd it difficult to continue medications and lifestyle cha nges when they are asymptomatic. Symptoms of elevated blood pressure usually do not occur until secondary problems arise such as with vascular diseases (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart fail ure and renal insufficiency) (Luehr D, et. al., 201 2). Appropriate follow-up after blood pressure measurem ent is a pivotal component in preventing the progression of hypertension and the development of heart disease. Detection of marginally or fully elevated blood pressure by a specialty clinician wa rrants referral to a provider familiar with the management of hypertension and prehypertension. The 2010 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk in Asymptomatic Adults conti nues to support using a global risk score such as t he Framingham Risk Score, to assess risk of coronary h eart disease (CHD) in all asymptomatic adults (Greenland P, et. al., 2010). Lifestyle modificatio ns have demonstrated effectiveness in lowering bloo d pressure (JNC 7, 2003). The synergistic effect of s everal lifestyle modifications results in greater b enefits than a single modification alone. Baseline diagnost ic/laboratory testing establishes if a co-existing underlying condition is the etiology of hypertensio n and evaluates if end organ damage from hypertensi on has already occurred. Landmark trials such as ALLHA T have repeatedly proven the efficacy of 81 pharmacologic therapy to control blood pressure and reduce the complications of hypertension. Follow-u p intervals based on blood pressure control have been established by the JNC 7 and the USPSTF. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) re commends screening for high blood pressure in adults age 18 years and older. This is a grade A re commendation.

Measure Type: Process 82 Measure #66 (NQF 0002, e-CQM CMS 146v4) Appropriate Testing Pharyngitis - National Quality Strate gy Domain: Efficiency and Cost Reduction 2016 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: REGISTRY ONLY DESCRIPTION: Percentage of children 3-18 years of age who were d iagnosed with pharyngitis, ordered an antibiotic an d received a group A streptococcus (strep) test for t he episode INSTRUCTIONS: This measure is to be reported once for each occurr ence of pharyngitis during the reporting period. Claims data will be analyzed to determine unique oc currences. This measure is intended to reflect the quality of services provided for the primary manage ment of patients with pharyngitis who were dispense d an antibiotic. This measure may be reported by clin icians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the meas ure-specific denominator coding. Measure Reporting via Registry : ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, CPT or HCPCS codes, qual ity-data codes and patient demographics are used to identify patients who are included in the m easure's denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the measure. The quality-data codes listed do not need to be sub mitted for registry-based submissions; however, the se codes may be submitted for those registries that ut ilize claims data. There are no allowable performan ce exclusions for this measure. DENOMINATOR: Children 3 through 18 years of age who had an outpa tient or emergency department (ED) visit with a diagnosis of pharyngitis during the measurement per iod and an antibiotic ordered on or three days afte r the visit Denominator Instructions: To determine eligibility, look for any of the list ed antibiotic drugs below in the 30 days prior to the visit with the p haryngitis diagnosis. As long as there are no prescriptions for the listed antibiotics during th is time period, the patient is eligible for denomin ator inclusion. Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases): Patients aged 3 through 18 years on date of encoun ter AND G8711 83 Table 1 - Antibiotic Medications NUMERATOR: Children with a group A streptococcus test in the 7 -day period from 3 days prior through 3 days after the pharyngitis episode date Numerator Instructions: For performance, the measure will be calculated as the number of patient encounters where diagnosed with pharyngiti s, dispensed an antibiotic and received a group A streptococcus (strep) test for the episode over the total number of encounters in the denominator (patients aged 3 through 18 years with an outpatient or ED visit and an antibiotic ordered on or three days after the visit). A highe r score indicates appropriate treatment of children with pharyngitis (e.g., the proportion for whom an tibiotics were prescribed with an accompanying step test). Numerator Options: Performance Met: Group A Strep Test Performed (3210F) OR 84 Performance Not Met: Group A Strep Test not Performed, reason not ot herwise specified (3210F with 8P) RATIONALE: Group A streptococcal bacterial infections and othe r infections that cause pharyngitis (which are most often viral) often produce the same signs and sympt oms (IDSA 2002). The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Pre vention, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America all recommend a diagnostic test for Strep A to improve diagnostic accuracy and avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment (Linder et al. 200 5). A study on antibiotic treatment of children wit h sore throat found that although only 15 to 36 percent of children with sore throat have Strep A pharyngitis , physicians prescribed antibiotics to 53 percent of children with a chief complaint of sore throat betw een 1995 and 2003 (Linder et al., 2005). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) ( 2007) Reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics. Antibiotic t reatment should be reserved for a bacterial illness . Diagnosis of group A beta streptococcal Pharyngitis should be made by laboratory testing rather than clinically. Infectious Disease Society of America (Bisno et al. 2002) The signs and symptoms of group A streptococcal and other (most frequently viral) pharyngitides overla p broadly. Therefore, unless the physician is able wi th confidence to exclude the diagnosis of streptoco ccal pharyngitis on epidemiological and clinical grounds alone, a laboratory test should be done to determi ne whether group A streptococci are present in the pha rynx. With the exception of very rare infections by certa in other pharyngeal gonorrhoe ae), antimicrobial therapy is of no proven benefit as treatment for acute pharyngitis due to bacteria oth er than group A streptococci. Therefore, it is extr emely important that physicians exclude the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis to prevent inappropriate administration of antimicrobials. Michigan Quality Improvement Consortium (2007) Probability of group A beta hemolytic streptococci (GABHS): Low; Testing: None; of GABHS: Intermediate or High; Testing: Throat Culture (TC) OR Rapid Screen; Treatment: If TC is positive, use antibiotics. If TC is negative, use symptomatic treatment only. Avoid antibiotics. If t reatment is started and culture result is negative, stop antibiotics. If Rapid Screen is positive, use antib iotics. If Rapid Screen is negative, culture (Cultu re is optional for age 16 and over) and only use antibiot ics if throat culture is positive.

Measure Type: Process 86 Measure #238 (NQF 0022, e-CQM CMS 156v4) Appropriate Testing Pharyngitis - National Quality Strate gy Domain: Patient Safety 2016 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: REGISTRY ONLY DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients 66 years of age and older wh o were ordered high-risk medications. Two rates are reported. 1. Percentage of patients who were ordered at least one high-risk medication. 2. Percentage of patients who were ordered at least two different high-risk medications INSTRUCTIONS: This measure is to be reported a minimum of once pe r reporting period for patients seen during the reporting period. There is no diagnosis associated with this measure. This measure may be reported by eligible professionals who perform the quality acti ons described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator codin g. This measure will be calculated with 2 performance rates: 1. Percentage of patients who were ordered at least one high-risk medication 2. Percentage of patients who were ordered at least two different high-risk medications Eligible professionals should continue to report th e measure as specified, with no additional steps ne eded to account for multiple performance rates. Measure Reporting via Registry: CPT or HCPCS codes and patient demographics are use d to identify visits that are included in the measure's denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the measure. The quality-data codes listed do not need to be sub mitted for registry-based submissions; however, the se codes may be submitted for those registries that ut ilize claims data. There are no allowable performan ce exclusions for this measure. THERE ARE TWO REPORTING CRITERIA FOR THIS MEASURE: 1) Percentage of patients who were ordered at least one high-risk medication OR 2) Percentage of patients who were ordered at least two different high-risk medications REPORTING CRITERIA 1: PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WHO WE RE ORDERED AT LEAST ONE HIGH-RISK MEDICATION DENOMINATOR (REPORTING CRITERIA 1): Patients 66 years and older who had a visit during the measurement period Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases) 1: Patients aged 66 years on date of encounter AND Patient encounter during reporting (REPORTING CRITERIA 1): Percentage of patients who were ordered at least on e high-risk medication during the measurement period Numerator Instructions: INVERSE MEASURE - A lower calculated performance rate for this mea sure indicates better clinical care or control. The \"Performance Not Met\" numerator opt ion for this measure is the representation of the better clinical quality or control. Reporting that numerator option will produce a performance rate th at trends closer to 0%, as quality increases. For inve rse measures a rate of 100% means all of the denominator eligible patients did not receive the a ppropriate care or were not in proper control, and therefore an inverse measure at 100% does not quali fy for reporting purposes, however any reporting rate less than 100% does qualify. A high-risk medication is identified by either of the following: A prescription for medications classified as high risk at any dose and for any dur ation listed in Table 1 Prescriptions for medications classified as high r isk at any dose with greater than a 90 day cumulative medication duration listed in Table 2 Definitions: Cumulative Medication Duration - an individual's total number of medication days over a specific period; the period counts multiple prescr iptions with gaps in between, but does not count the gaps during which a medication was not dispens ed. To determine the cumulative medication duration, d etermine first the number of the Medication Days for each prescription in the period: the numb er of doses divided by the dose frequency per day. Then add the Medication Days for each prescri ption without counting any days between the prescriptions. Table 1 - High-Risk Medications at any dose or dura tion 88 Table 2 - High-Risk Medications With Days Supply Cr iteria 89 NUMERATOR NOTE: Some high-risk medications are not included in thi s specific measure but should be avoided above a specified average daily dose. These medications are listed in table DAE-C. To calculat e an average daily dose multiply the quantity of pill s ordered by the dose of each pill and divide by th e days' supply. For example, a prescription for a 30-day su pply of digoxin containing 15 pills, 0.250 mg each pill, has an average daily dose of 0.125 mg. Table DAE-C: High-Risk Medications With Average Dai ly Dose Criteria Numerator Options: Performance Met: One high-risk medication ordered (G9365) OR Performance Not Met: One high-risk medication not ordered (G9366) OR REPORTING CRITERIA 2: PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WHO WE RE ORDERED AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT HIGH-RISK MEDICATIONS DENOMINATOR (REPORTING CRITERIA 2): Patients 66 years and older who had a visit during the measurement period Denominator Criteria (Eligible Cases) 2: Patients aged 66 years on date of encounter AND Patient encounter during reporting CRITERIA 2): Percentage of patients who were ordered at least tw o different high-risk medications during the measurement period Numerator Instructions: INVERSE MEASURE - A lower calculated performance rate for this mea sure indicates better clinical care or control.

These medications are listed in table DAE-C. To calculate an average daily dose multiply the quantity of pills ordered by the dose of each pill and divide by the days' supply. For exam ple, a prescription for a 30-day supply of digoxin containing 15 pills, 0.250 mg each pill, h as an average daily dose of 0.125 mg. Table DAE-C: High-Risk Medications With Average Dai ly Dose Criteria Numerator Options: Performance Met: At least two different high-risk medications ordere d (G9367) OR Performance Not Met: At least two different high-risk medications not or dered (G9368) RATIONALE: Seniors receiving inappropriate medications are mor e likely to report poorer health status at follow-u p, compared to seniors who receive appropriate medicat ions (Fu, Liu, and Christensen 2004). In 2005, rate s of potentially inappropriate medication use in the elderly were as large as or larger than in a 1996 n ational 92 sample, highlighting the need for progress in this area (Simon et al. 2005). While some adverse drug events are not preventable, studies estimate that b etween 30 and 80 percent of adverse drug events in the elderly are preventable (MacKinnon and Hepler 2 003). Reducing the number of inappropriate prescriptions can lead to improved patient safety and significant cost savings. Conservative estimates of extra costs due to potentially inappropriate medications in th e elderly average $7.2 billion a year (Fu, Liu, and C hristensen 2004). Medication use by older adults wi ll likely increase further as the U.S. population ages , new drugs are developed, and new therapeutic and preventive uses for medications are discovered (Rot hberg et al. 2008). By the year 2030, nearly one in five U.S. residents is expected to be aged 65 years or older; this age group is projected to more than double in number from 38.7 million in 2008 to more than 88.5 million in 2050. Likewise, the population aged 85 years or older is expected to increase almo st four-fold, from 5.4 million to 19 million betwee n 2008 and 2050. As the elderly population continues to grow, the number of older adults who present wit h multiple medical conditions for which several medic ations are prescribed continues to increase, result ing in polypharmacy (Gray and Gardner 2009). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS : The measure is based on the literature and key clin ical expert consensus processes by Beers in 1997, Zahn in 2001 and an updated process by Fick in 2003 , which identified drugs of concern in the elderly based on various high-risk criteria. NCQA's Medicat ion Management expert panel selected a subset of drugs that should be used with caution in the elder ly for inclusion in the proposed measure based upon these two lists. NCQA analyzed the prevalence of dr ugs prescribed according to the Beers and Zhan classifications and determined that drugs identifie d by Zhan that are classified as never or rarely appropriate would form the basis for the list (Fick 2003). Certain medications (MacKinnon 2003) are associated with increased risk of harms from drug side-effect s and drug toxicity and pose a concern for patient sa fety. There is clinical consensus that these drugs pose increased risks in the elderly (Kaufman 2005). Stud ies link prescription drug use by the elderly with adverse drug events that contribute to hospitalizat ion, increased length of hospital stay, increased duration of illness, nursing home placement and fal ls and fractures that are further associated with physical, functional and social decline in the elde rly (AHRQ 2009).

Measure Type: Process 94 Measure #240 (NQF 0038, e-CQM CMS 117v4) Childhood Immunization Status - National Quality Strategy Domain: Community / Population Hea lth 2016 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: REGISTRY ONLY DESCRIPTION: Percentage of children 2 years of age who had four diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP); three polio (IPV), one measles, mumps three (HiB); three hepatit is B (Hep B); one chicken conjugate A (Hep A); or three rotavirus (RV); and two influenza (flu) vacci nes by their second birthday. DENOMINATOR: Children who turn 2 years of age during the measure ment period and who have a visit during the measurement period NUMERATOR: Children who have evidence showing they received re commended vaccines, had documented history of the illness, had a seropositive test result, or had an allergic reaction to the vaccine by their secon d birthday RATIONALE: Infants and toddlers are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases because their immune systems have not built up the necessary defenses to fight i nfection (Centers for Disease Control and Preventio n 2011). Most childhood vaccines are between 90 and 9 9 percent effective in preventing diseases (HealthyChildren 2011). Immunization is a critical aspect of preventive care for children. Lack of pro per immunization leads to an increase in illness, docto r visits and hospitalizations, all of which transla te into higher costs. (Tatzlandrew, Brown, and Halpern). Va ccination of each U.S. birth cohort with the curren t childhood immunization schedule prevents approximat ely 42,000 deaths and 20 million cases of disease, and saves nearly $14 billion in direct costs and $6 9 billion in societal costs each year (Zhou 2011; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011b). Immunizing a child not only protects that child's h ealth but also the health of the community, especia lly for those who are not immunized or are unable to be imm unized due to other health complications (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009). When the majority of the community is immunized against a disease, other members of the community are also pr otected because herd immunity shields them. (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disea ses 2010). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT: Summary of Recommendations for Child/Teen Immunizat ion (Ages birth through 18 years) (Immunization Action Coalition) based on recommendations of the A dvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP, 2012) Hepatitis B (HepB) - Vaccinate all children age 0 through 18 years - Vaccinate all newborns with monovalent vaccine pr ior to hospital discharge. Give dose #2 at age 1-2 months and the final dose at age 6-18 months (the l ast dose in the infant series should not be given earlier than age 24 weeks). After the birth dose, t he series may be completed using 2 doses of single- antigen vaccine or up to 3 doses of Comvax(r) (ages 2 months, 4 months 12-15 months) or Pediatrix(r) (ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months), which may resu lt in giving a total of 4 doses of hepatitis B vacc ine. - If mother is HBsAg-positive: give the newborn HBI G + dose #1 within 12 hours of birth; complete seri es at age 6 months or, if using Comvax(r), at age 12-1 5 months. - If mother is HBsAg status is unknown: given the n ewborn dose #1 within 12 hours of birth. If low bir th weight (less than 2000 grams), also give HBIG withi n 12 hours. For infants weighing 2000 grams or more 95 whose mother is subsequently found to be HBsAg posi tive, give the infant HBIG ASAP (no later than 7 days of birth) and follow HepB immunization schedul e for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. DTaP, DT vaccinations (4 Diptheria, tetanus, acellu lar pertussis) - Give to children at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 mo nths, 15-18 months, 4-6 years.- May give dose #1 as early as age 6 weeks. - May give #4 as early as age 12 months if 6 months have elapsed since #3. - Do not give DTaP/DT to children age 7 years and o lder. - If possible, use the same DTaP product for all do ses. Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) - ActHib(r) (PRP-T): give at age 2 months, 4 months , 6 months, 12-15 months (booster dose). - PedvaxHIB(r) or Comvax(r) (containing PRP-OMP): g ive at age 2 months, 4 months, 12-15 months (booster dose). - Dose #1 of Hib vaccine should not be given earlie r than age 6 weeks. - Give final dose (booster dose) no earlier than ag e 12 months and a minimum of 8 weeks after the previous dose. - Hib vaccines are interchangeable; however, if dif ferent brands of Hib vaccines are administered for dose #1 and dose #2, a total of 3 doses is necessary to complete the primary series in infants. - Any Hib vaccine may be used for the booster dose. - Hib is not routinely given to children age 5 year s and older. - Hiberix(r) is approved ONLY for the booster dose at age 12 months through 4 years. Polio (IPV) - Give to children at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, 4-6 years. - May give dose #1 as early as age 6 weeks. - Not routinely recommended for U.S. residents age 18 years and older (except certain travelers). MMR (Measles, mumps, rubella) - Give dose #1 at age 12-15 months. - Give MMR at age 6 through 11 months if traveling internationally; then revaccinate at age 12 months (and at least 4 weeks from previous dose). The dose given at younger than 12 months does not count toward the 2-dose series. - Give dose #2 at age 4-6 years. Dose #2 may be giv en earlier if at least 4 weeks since dose #1. For MMRV: dose #2 may be given earlier if at least 3 mo nths since dose #1. - Give a 2nd dose to all older children and teens w ith history of only 1 dose. MMRV may be used in children age 12 months through 12 years. For the first dose of MMR and varicella given at age 12-47 months, either MMR and Varicella (Var) or MMRV may be used. Unless the parent or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV, CDC reco mmends that MMR and Var should be given for the first dose in this age group.

Measure Type: Process 98 Measure #311 (NQF 0036, e-CQM CMS 126v4) Use of Appropriate Medications for Asthma - National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinica l Care 2016 PQRS OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES: REGISTRY ONLY DESCRIPTION: Percentage of patients 5-64 years of age who were i dentified as having persistent asthma and were appropriately prescribed medication during the meas urement period. DENOMINATOR: Patients 5-64 years of age with persistent asthma a nd a visit during the measurement period Exclusions : Patients with emphysema, COPD, cystic fibrosis or acute respiratory failure during or prior to the measurement period NUMERATOR: Patients who were dispensed at least one prescripti on for a preferred therapy during the measurement period RATIONALE: Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic disease s, becoming increasingly more commonplace over the past twenty years. Approximately 24.6 million A mericans have asthma, and it is responsible for ove r 3,000 deaths in the U.S. annually (American Lung As sociation 2010). In 2006, 13.3 million clinical vis its (hospital, outpatient, emergency department, and ph ysician offices) were attributed to asthma (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009). The incid ence rate, and subsequently the number of asthma- related health visits, is expected to increase by a n additional 100 million globally by 2025 (World He alth Organization 2007). Asthma accounts for over $20 billion spent on healt h care in the United States. Direct costs, includin g prescriptions, make up $15.6 billion of that total. Indirect costs, such as lost productivity, add an additional $5.1 billion (Centers for Disease Control and Preve ntion 2009). Inpatient hospitalization accounts for over 50 percent of overall asthma-related costs (Bahador i et al. 2009). In addition to the direct financial burden, asthma is also a leading cause of absenteei sm and productivity, accounting for an estimated 14 .2 million missed workdays for adults and over 14 mill ion missed school days for children (Akinbami et al . 2009). Studies have shown that the indirect costs o f asthma are becoming a growing financial burden on patients, and resulting in significant additional c osts (Bahadori et al. 2009). Appropriate medication management could potentially prevent a significant proportion of asthma-related costs (hospitalizations, emergency room visits and missed work and school days) (Akinbami et al. 2009) . The Asthma Regional Council supported this inferenc e, stating that proper management could potentially save at least 25 percent of total asthma costs, or $5 billion, nationally by reducing health care cost s (American Lung Association 2009). Another initiative, the Children's Health Fund's Ch ildhood Asthma Initiative, examined patients enroll ed in an asthma intervention program. Results illustrated that treatment that aligned with clinical guidelin es reduced the severity of symptoms experienced, as we ll as asthma-related events (e.g., hospitalizations , emergency room visits, etc.) (Columbia University 2 010). Additionally, subsequent savings attributed t o improved clinical outcomes totaled to nearly $4.2 m illion or $4,525 per patient. This translated to a significant reduction in federally subsidized and p rivate insurance-based costs for this population (Columbia University 2010). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT: National Heart Lung and Blood Institute/National As thma and Education Prevention Program (2007) 99 * Long-term control medications (include inhaled co rticosteroids (ICSs), immunomodulators) are used daily t o achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. The most effective are those that attenuate the underlying inflammation characteristic of asthma. T he Expert Panel defines anti-inflammatory medicatio ns as those that cause a reduction in the markers of a irway inflammation in airway tissue or airway secretions (e.g., eosinophils, mast cells, activate d lymphocytes, macrophages, and or Eosinophil cationic extravascular leakage of albumin, fibrinogen, or ot her vascular protein). * Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatme nt option for mild persistent asthma in adults and children. Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists (LTRAs) are an alternative, although not preferred, treatme nt. * Long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABAs) should only b e used in combination with ICSs for long-term contr ol and prevention of symptoms in moderate or severe pe rsistent asthma (step 3 care or higher in children =5 years of age and adults). There is a strong recomme ndation against the use of LABAs as monotherapy. Of the adjunctive therapies available, long-acting beta-2 agonists is the preferred therapy to combine with ICS in youths =12 years of age and adults. * The beneficial effects of long-acting beta-2 agon ists in combination therapy for the great majority of patients who require more therapy than low-dose ICS alone to control asthma (i.e., require step 3 care or higher) should be weighed against the increased ris k of severe exacerbations, although uncommon, associated with the daily use of long-acting beta-2 agonists (see discussion in text). * The NHLBI/NAEPP guideline strongly recommends aga inst the use of long-acting beta-2 agonists for the treatment of acute symptoms or exacerbations.
