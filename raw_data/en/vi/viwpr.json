Previously, they only allowed up to 1,000. Item Surgery Codes For cases diagnosed January 1, 2003 - December 31, 2022, use RX Summ --Surg Prim Site 03-2022 [1290]. Refer to historical WCRS Data Dictionaries and Reference Materials for coding instructions. For cases diagnosed January 1, 2023, and forward use RX Summ --Surg Prim Site 2023 [1291]. The Site- Specific Surgery Codes for Skin C44 are updated to align with the Synoptic Operative Report and revised to a four -digit, alphanumeric code for cases diagnosed January 1, 2023, and forward. These surgery codes are in Appendix A of the STORE Manual and Appendix C of the SEER Manual . Summary Stage 2018 Refer to the SEER S ummary Stage 2018 Manual for the most complete information and change log. N ew Summary Stage 2018 chapter for Medulloblastoma added which applies to cases diagnosed from January 1, 2023, and forward.

Registrars are not required to update previously coded information. 1 ABSTRACTED BY Item # Length 570 3 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: abstractedBy PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description An alphanumeric code assigned by the reporting facility that identifies the individual abstracting the case. Additional Information First, middle and last name initials of the abstractor. If the abstractor does not have a middle name, just enter the two initials. If there is more than one abstractor with the same three initials in the facility, use the first and last name initials followed by a numeric sequence (JD1, JD2, etc.). Instructions Source: STORE Manual Code the initials of the abstractor. 2 ACCESSION NUMBER-- HOSP Item # Length 550 Name: (CoC) XML NAACCR ID: accessionNumberHosp PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Provides a unique identifier for the patient consisting of the year in which the patient was first seen at the reporting facility and the consecutive order in which the patient was abstracted. The first four numbers specify the year, and the last five numbers are the numeric order in which the patient was entered into the registry database. Within a registry, all primaries for an individual must have the same accession number. The first four digits must be greater than or equal to 1944. Example: The 31st patient abstracted at facility X in calendar year 2022 will have a hospital accession number of 2022 00031. If this same patient is seen in later in 20 22 with a new primary cancer, the accession number will still stay the same as the original, first time seen in that facility (202200031). The sequence number field will change to indicate the new primary cancer. Rationale This data item protects the identity of the patient and allows cases to be identified on a local, state, and national level. If the central registry preserves this number, they can refer to it when communicating with the reporting facilities. It also provides a way to link computerized follow -up reports from reporting facilities into the central database. Coding Instructions Source: STORE Manual When a patient is deleted from the database, do not reuse the accession number for another patient. The first four numbers specify the year, and the last five numbers are the numeric order in which the patient was entered into the registry database. Numeric gaps are allowed in accession numbers. A patient's accession number is never reassigned. 3 ADDR AT DX--CITY Item # Length 70 50 Alternate Name: City or Town (pre- 96 CoC) City/Town at Diagnosis (CoC) XML NAACCR ID: addrAtDxCity PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Name of the city in which the patient resides at the time the reportable tumor was diagnosed. If the patient resides in a rural area, record the name of the city used in the mailing address. If the patient has multiple primaries, the city of residence may be different for each primary. Codes (in addition to valid City) UNKNOWN City at diagnosis unknown 4 ADDR AT DX--NO & STREET Item # Length 2330 60 Alternate Name: Patient Address (Number and Street) at Diagnosis (CoC) Street CoC) XML PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description The number and street address or rural mailing address of the patient's residence at the time the reportable tumor was diagnosed. Residential street address should not include PO Boxes. IMPORTANT: PO Box mailing address should only be recorded when no other address information is available in the medical record and no other information sources are available. Rationale The address is part of the patient's demographic data and has multiple uses. It can be used to evaluate referral patterns, allows for the analysis of cancer cluster concerns, and supports epidemiological studies that use area- based social measures. Codes (in addition to valid street address) UNKNOWN Patient's address is unknown Coding Instructions and Summary of USPS Guidelines. The address should be fully spelled out with standardized use of abbreviations and punctuation per USPS postal addressing standards. Upper case is required. This field is intended to store street address information for the patient's physical, residential address. All efforts should be made to find the patient's true street address and postal code, including reviewing relevant sources outside the medical record if available. If the patient has multiple tumors, address at diagnosis may be different for each tumor. Do not update this item if the patient's residential address changes. Store updated address information in the affiliated current address data items. Only update based on improved information on the residential address at time of diagnos is. Additional address information such as facility, nursing home, name of apartment complex, or a PO Box used for mailing purposes, should be entered in Addr At Dx --Supplementl [2335]. U.S. addresses should conform to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Postal Addressing Standards. These standards are referenced in USPS Publication 28, Postal Addressing Standards. The current USPS Pub. 28 may be found and downloaded here . 5 The address should be fully spelled out with standardized use of abbreviations and punctuation per USPS postal addressing standards (USPS Pub. 28, available at link above). Mixed case allowed. Canadian addresses should conform to the Canada Postal Guide. The current Canadian Postal Address Standards may be found here . Punctuation marks should be avoided, except when punctuation is necessary to convey the meaning. Punctuation normally is limited to periods when the period carries meaning (e.g., 39.2 RD), slashes for fractional addresses (e.g., 101 1/2 Main St), and hyphens when the hyphen carries meaning (e.g., 289- 01 Montgomery Ave). Use of the pound sign (#) to designate address units should be avoided whenever possible. The preferred notation is as follows: 102 Main St Apt 101. If a pound sign is used, there must be a space between the pound sign and the secondary number (e.g., 425 Flower Blvd # 72). Abbreviations should be limited to those recognized by USPS standard abbreviations, these include, but are not limited, to the list below: (A complete list of recognized street abbreviations are provided in Appendix C of USPS Pub. 28 available at link above): APT apartment N north BLDG building NE northeast FL floor NW northwest STE suite S south UNIT unit SE Southeast RM room SW southwest DEPT department E east W west 6 ADDR AT DX --POSTAL CODE Item # Length 100 9 Alternate Name: Zip Code (pre- CoC) Postal Code (CCCR) Postal Code at Diagnosis (CoC) XML NAACCR ID: addrAtDxPostalCode PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Identifies the postal code of the patient's address at diagnosis . Rationale The postal code is part of the patient's demographic data and has multiple uses. It can be used to evaluate referral patterns, allows for the analysis of cancer cluster concerns, and supports epidemiological studies that use area- based social measures. Codes (in addition to known US and Canadian or other postal codes) 888888888 Resident of country other than the United States, U.S. possessions or territories, or Canada and the postal code is unknown 999999999 Resident of the United States (including its possessions, etc.) and the postal code is unknown 999999 Resident of Canada and postal code is unknown Coding Instructions This field is intended to store ZIP Code or other postal code for the patient's physical, residential address. The postal code for PO Box mailing address should not be entered into this data item except in the infrequent case when no other address information is available. If the patient has multiple tumors, the postal code at diagnosis may be different for each tumor. Do not update this item if the patient's residential address changes. Store address update information in the affiliated current address data items. Only update based on improved information on the residential address at time of diagnosis. For U.S. residents, use either the 5- digit or the extended 9- digit ZIP code. Blanks follow the 5- digit code if the 4- digit extension is not collected. For Canadian residents, use the 6- character alphanumeric postal code. When available, enter the postal code for other countries for out -of-country addresses. 7 ADDR AT DX --STATE Item # Length 80 2 Alternate Name: State at Diagnosis (CoC) State (pre-96 CoC) XML NAACCR addrAtDxState PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Identifies the patient's state or province of residence at the time of diagnosis . Rationale The state of residence is part of the patient's demographic data and has multiple uses. It can be used to evaluate referral patterns, allows for the analysis of cancer cluster concerns, and support s epidemiological studies that use area- based social measures. Codes (in addition to USPS abbreviations) CD Resident of Canada, NOS (province/territory unknown) US Resident of United States, NOS (state/commonwealth/territory/possession unknown) XX Resident of country other than the United States (including its territories, commonwealths, or possessions) or Canada, and country is known YY Resident of country other than the United States (including its territories, commonwealths, or possessions) or Canada, and country is unknown ZZ Residence unknown Coding Instructions This field is intended to store residential state for the patient's physical, residential address. The state for PO Box mailing address should not be entered into this data item except in the infrequent case when no other address information is available. If the patient has multiple tumors, state at diagnosis may be different for each tumor. Do not update this item if the patient's residential address changes. Store address update information in the affiliated current address data items. Only update based on improved information on the residential address at time of diagnosis. Use the U. S. Postal Service abbreviation or Canada Post abbreviation in which the patient resides at the time the reportable tumor is diagnosed. If the patient is a foreign resident, then code either XX or YY depending on the circumstance. 8 ADDR AT DX --SUPPLEMENTL Item # Length 2335 60 Alternate Name: Patient Address (Number and Street) at --Supplemental (CoC) XML NAACCR ID: addrAtDxSupplementl PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Provides the ability to store additional address information such as the name of a place or facility (for example a nursing home, apartment complex, jail or PO Box residential or other mailing address) at the time of diagnosis. Rationale Sometimes the registry receives the name of a facility instead of a proper street address containing the stree t number, name, direction, and other elements necessary to locate an address on a street file for the purpose of geocoding. By having a second street address field to hold address information, the registry can look up, store the street address, and not los e the facility name. The presence of a second street address field to hold additional address information also aids in follow- up. For instance, Addr At DX --No & Street [2330] should contain a street address only. However, it is important to retain any PO Box information for linkage and patient contact studies. Retaining facility name can also help correct errors in Addr At DX --No & Street [2330] or assist with geocoding or consolidation. Additionally, researchers can use this field to verify if geographic areas of high risk are driven by location of facilities, such as jails, nursing homes, or homeless shelters. Coding Instructions Record the full name of the place or facility (Sunnyside Nursing Home, for example) of the patient's residence when the tumor was diagnosed. Numbers, alpha characters and spaces are allowed. Do not use this item for information stored in other address items such as Addr At DX --NO & Street. Record a full residential PO Box here (including city & zip code) or other non-physical, residential mailing address here. Record HOMELESS here when the street address used is a shelter or diagnosing facility for persons with no usual residence. If the patient has multiple tumors, address at diagnosis supplemental may be different for each tumor. Do not update this item if the patient's residential address changes. Store updated address information in the affiliated current address data items. Only update based on improved information on the residential address at time of diagnosis. 9 AGE AT DIAGNOSIS Item # Length 230 3 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: ageAtDiagnosis PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Age of the patient at diagnosis in complete years. Different tumors for the same patient may have different values. IMPORTANT: Remember to include the patient's age in the PE Text field. Codes 000 Less than 1 year old; diagnosed in utero 001 1 year old, but less than 2 years 002 2 years old ... 120 120 years old 999 Unknown age Additional Information Many software programs calculate this field automatically upon entry of the date of birth and date of diagnosis. 10 AJCC CANCER SURVEILLANCE DLL VERSION CURRENT Item # Length 2158 13 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: ajccCancerSurvApiVersionCurrent PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description This item indicates the most recently accessed version of the Cancer Surveillance .dll incorporated into the cancer registry software that created the record with stage data diagnosed 2018 and later. It will be assigned based on the version in use in the registry software system. It must be updated every time a new version is incorporated into your system and all relevant cases should be updated to reflect the same value. For cases diagnosed prior to 2018, this field should remain blank. For cases diagnosed in 2018- 2020, this field should be set to the version in use at the time of implementation. For cases diagnosed in 2018 and later abstracted after implementation, use the version in use at the time the case is being abstracted. Rationale Over time, the definitions and other content contained in the .dll may change. This item identifies the current API content used to code the items. Codes This data item will be generated by registry software. The va lue is obtained from the .dll. The AJCC Cancer Surveillance API contains contents to support collection of AJCC's TNM, EOD, SSDI's, and directly entered Summary Stage 2018. The underlying contents are loaded from AJCC's API and SEER's web service. The API is versioned independently from the imported contents. The value indicates the version of the Cancer Surveillance API used most recently to code the items listed below and is obtained from the API. It should be recorded the first time the AJCC ID (incl uding a value of XX) and/or Schema ID is determined and should be updated each time an updated AJCC Cancer Surveillance API is implemented. 11 AJCC CANCER SURVEILLANCE DLL VERSION ORIGINAL Item # Length 2159 13 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: ajccCancerSurvApiVersionOriginal PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description This item indicates the version of the AJCC Cancer Surveillance .dll incorporated into the cancer registry software that created the record with stage data diagnosed 2018 and later. It should be recorded the first time the AJCC ID (including a value of XX) and/or Schema ID are determined using the .dll. The value is obtained from the .dll. Rationale Over time, the definitions and other content contained in the .dll may change. This item identifies the original content used to code the items. Codes This data item will be generated by registry software. The AJCC Cancer Surveillance API contains contents to support collection of AJCC's TNM, EOD, and directly entered Summary Stage 2018. The underlying contents are loaded from AJCC's API and SEER's web service. The API is versioned independently from the imported contents. The value indicates the version of the AJCC Cancer Surveillance API originally used to code the items listed below and is obtained from the API. It should be recorded the first time the AJCC ID (including a value of XX) and/or Schema ID is determined and should not be updated each time the related input fields are modified. However, if changes made to the diagnosis and/or date of diagnosis result in a different AJCC ID and/or Schema ID, the value for Cancer Surveillance API Version Original should be reset. 12 AJCC ID Item # Length 995 4 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: ajccId PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description The values for this data item are based on the chapters of the AJCC manual and will be derived primarily from the site/histology fields and other data items as required. IDs are assigned to cases for which AJCC staging is applicable. When staging is not applicable, code 'XX' is used. Rationale This data item will be used to create an efficient process for running TNM Edits. Each Site -Specific Data Item (SSDI) applies only to selected primary sites, histologies, a nd years of diagnosis. Depending on applicability and standard- setter requirements, SSDIs may be left blank. 13 BEHAVIOR CODE ICD-O-3 Item # Length 523 1 Alternate Name: Behavior Code (CoC) ICD-O-3 Behaviour (CCCR) XML NAACCR ID: behaviorCodeIcdO3 PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Code for the behavior of the tumor being reported using ICD -O-3. NAACCR adopted ICD-O- 3 as the standard coding system for tumors diagnosed beginning January 1, 2001, and later recommended that prior cases be converted from ICD -O-2. See Behavior (92- as borderline in ICD -O-3; North American registries report as 9421/3. Codes 0 Benign (Reportable for intracranial and CNS sites onl y) 1 Uncertain whether benign or malignant, borderline malignancy, low malignant potential, and uncertain malignant potential (Reportable for intracranial and CNS sites only) 2 Carcinoma in situ; intraepithelial; noninfiltrating; non- invasive (carcinoma) 3 Malignant, primary site (invasive) Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual General Code behavior prior to neo adjuvant therapy when given. Intracranial and CNS tumors 1. Intracranial and CNS tumors with behavior codes 0 (benign) and 1 (borderline malignancy) are reportable beginning with January 1, 2004 diagnoses. 2. Code the behavior from CT scan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) report when there is no tissue diagnosis (pathology or cytology report). Code the behavior listed on the scan. Do not use the WHO grade to code behavior. Metastatic or Non -primary Sites 1. Cases reported to WCRS cannot have a metastatic (/6) behavior code. If the only pathologic specimen is from a metastatic site, code the appropriate histology code and the malignant behavior code (/3). The primary site and its metastatic site(s) have the same histology. 14 2. Code the behavior as malignant (/3) when malignant metastasis is present. Metastasis could be regional, nodal, or distant. a. Example: Adenocarcinoma in situ with lymph nodes positive for malignancy. Code the behavior as malignant (/3). When the invasive component c annot be found and there are positive lymph nodes, assign behavior /3 based on the positive lymph nodes. b. Exception: For in situ breast cancer, code as non- invasive (/2) in the presence of isolated tumor cells or if cells are artifactually displaced from a previous procedure. In Situ 1. Clinical evidence alone cannot identify the behavior as in situ; a behavior code of /2 (in situ) must be based on pathologic examination. In Situ and Invasive 1. Code the behavior as malignant (/3) if any portion of the primary tumor is invasive no matter how limited, i.e., microinvasion. a. Example: Pathology from mastectomy: large mass composed of intraductal carcinoma with a single focus of invasion. Code the behavior as malignant (/3). 2. Re-code the behavior as malignant (/3) when metastases are attributed to a tumor originally thought to be in situ. a. Example: Right colon biopsy reveals tubulovillous adenoma with microfocal carcinoma in situ; right hemicolectomy is negative for residual disease. Later core liver biopsy consisten t with metastatic adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal origin. Oncologist states most likely colon primary. Change the behavior code for the colon primary from /2 to /3. There were no other colon primaries in this case. ICD-O-3.2 Histology/Behavior Code Lis ting Source: SEER Manual Note: The 2023 ICD -O-3.2 Histology Code and Behavior Update includes comprehensive tables listing all changes made after the 2022 update and is effective for cases diagnosed 1/1/2023 forward. Behavior is the fifth digit of the morphology code after the slash (/). The standard reference for coding behavior is the ICD-O- 3.2. Pages 27 through 30 in ICD -O-3 discuss behavior. The following general rules are found on pages 29- 30 in ICD-O- 3. 1. Usually , a histologic term carries a clear indication of the likely behavior of the tumor, whether malignant or benign, and this is reflected in the behavior code assigned to it in the ICD -O. 2. Although only a few histologic types of in situ neoplasms are actually listed in the ICD -O, the behavior code /2 could be attached to any histology code if an in situ form of the neoplasm is diagnosed . 3. If the pathologist disagrees with the ICD -O behavior assignment in a particular case, code the behavior according to the pathologist's description of the behavior even if that histology/behavior combination is not listed in the ICD -O. 4. The pathologist has the final say on the behavior of the tumor. ICD -O-3 may have only one behavior code, in situ (/2) or malignant (/3), listed for a specific histology. If the pathology report describes the histology as in situ and the ICD -O-3 histology code is listed only with a malignant behavior code (/3), assign the in situ behavior code (/2). If the pathology report describes histology as malignant and the ICD -O-3 histology code is listed only with an in situ 15 behavior code (/2), assign the malignant behavior code (/3). See the Morphology and Behavior Code Matrix discussion on page 29 in ICD -O-3. a. Example: The pathology report says large cell carcinoma in situ. The ICD -O-3 lists large cell carcinoma only with a malignant behavior (8012/3). Code the histology and behavior as 8012/2 as specified by the pathologist.

If the patient has multiple tumors, all records should contain the same code. Rationale Place of Birth is helpful for patient matching and can be used when reviewing race and ethnicity. It is an important item in algorithms for imputing race and ethnicity. In addition, adding birthplace data to race and ethnicity allows for a more specific definition of the population being reported. Careful descriptions of ancestry, birthplace, and immigration history of populations studied are needed to make the basis for classification into ethnic groups clear. Birthplace has been associated with variation in genetic, socioeconomic, cultural, and nutritional characteristics that affect patterns of disease. A better understanding of the differences within racial and ethnic categories also can help states develop effective, culturally sensitive public health prevention programs to decrease the prevalence of high- risk behaviors and increase the use of preventive services.

This data item captures clinically important brain cancer subtypes identified by molecular markers that are not distinguishable by ICD -O-3 codes . Rationale Collection of these clinically important brain cancer subtypes has been recommended by Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States . Codes Each Site -Specific Data Item (SSDI) applies only to selected primary sites, histologies, and years of diagnosis. Depending on applicability and standard- setter requirements, SSDIs may be left blank. 01 Diffuse astrocytoma, IDH oligodendroglioma, Benign or borderline tumor 87 Test ordered, results not in chart 88 Not applicable: Information not collected for this case 99 Not documented in patient record No microscopic confirmation Brain molecular markers not assessed or unknown if assessed Coding Instructions Refer to the SSDI Manual for applicable schemas and coding instructions. 19 BRESLOW TUMOR THICKNESS Item # Length 3817 4 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: breslowTumorThickness PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Breslow Tumor Thickness, the measurement of the thickness of a melanoma as defined by Dr. Alexander Breslow, is a prognostic factor for Melanoma of the Skin. The tumor thickness (depth) is usually measured from the top of the tumor to the deepest tumor cells. If the tumor is ulcerated (skin is broken), it is measured from the base of the ulcer to the deepest tumor cells. Breslow thickness is used to help determine stage and is linked to surv ival rates. Rationale Breslow Tumor Thickness is a Registry Data Collection Variable in AJCC. It was previously collected as Melanoma Skin, CS SSF# 1. Codes Each Site -Specific Data Item (SSDI) applies only to selected primary sites, histologies, and years of diagnosis. Depending on applicability and standard- setter requirements, SSDIs may be left blank. 0.0 No mass/tumor found 0.1 Greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 0.1 0.2-99.9 0.2 - 99.9 millimeters XX.1 100 millimeters or larger A0.1-A9.9 Stated as \"at least\" some measured value of 0.1 to 9.9 AX.0 Stated as greater than 9.9 mm XX.8 Not applicable: Information not collected for this schema (If required by your standard setter, use of code XX.8 will result in an edit error) XX.9 Not documented in medical record Microinvasion; microscopic focus or foci only and no depth given Cannot be determined by pathologist In situ melanoma Breslow Tumor Thickness not assessed or unknown if assessed Coding Guidelines Refer to the SSDI Manual for applicable schemas and coding instructions. 20 CASEFINDING SOURCE Item # Length 501 2 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: casefindingSource PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description This variable codes the earliest source of identifying information. For cases identified by a source other than reporting facilities (such as through death clearance or as a result of an audit), this variable codes the type of source through which the tumor was first identified. This data item cannot be used by itself as a data quality indicator. The timing of the casefinding processes (e.g., death linkage) varies from registry to registry, and the coded value of this variable is a function of t hat timing. Rationale This data item will help reporting facilities as well as regional and central registries in prioritizing their casefinding activities. It will identify reportable tumors that were first found through death clearance or sources other t han traditional reporting facilities. It provides more detail than \"Type of Reporting Source.\" Codes 10 Reporting Hospital, NOS 20 Pathology Department Review (surgical pathology reports, autopsies, or cytology reports) 21 Daily Discharge Review (daily screening of charts of discharged patients in the medical records department) 22 Disease Index Review (review of disease index in the medical records department) 23 Radiation Therapy Department/Center 24 Laboratory Reports (other than pathology reports, code 20) 25 Outpatient Chemotherapy 26 Diagnostic Imaging/Radiology (other than radiation therapy, codes 23; includes nuclear medicine) 27 Tumor Board 21 28 Hospital Rehabilitation Service or Clinic 29 Other Hospital Source (including clinic, NOS or outpatient department, NOS) 30 Physician -Initiated Case 40 Consultation- only or Pathology -only Report (not abstracted by reporting hospital) 50 Independent (non- hospital) Pathology -Laboratory Report 60 Nursing Home -Initiated Case 70 Coroner's Office Records Review 75 Managed Care Organization (MCO) or Insurance Records 80 Death Certificate (case identified through death clearance) 85 Out-of-State Case Sharing 90 Other Non -Reporting Hospital Source 95 Quality Control Review (case initially identified through quality control activities such as casefinding audit of a regional or central registry) 99 Unknown Coding Instructions This variable is intended to code the source that first identified the tumor. Determine where the case was first identified and enter the appropriate code. At the regional or central level, if a hospital and a non- hospital source identified the case independently of each other, enter the code for the non- hospital source (i.e., codes 30- 95 have priority over codes 10- 29). If the case was first identified at a reporting facility (codes 10- 29), code the earliest source (based on patient or specimen contact at the facility) of identifying information. If a death certificate, independent pathology laboratory report, consultation- only report from a hospital, or other report was used to identify a case that was then abstracted from a different source, enter the code for the source that first identified the case, not the source from which i t was subsequently abstracted. If a regional or central registry identifies a case and asks a reporting facility to abstract it, enter the code that corresponds to the initial source, not the code that corresponds to the eventual reporting facility. 22 CAUSE OF DEATH Item # Length 1910 4 Alternate Name: Underlying Cause of Death (SEER) Underlying Cause of Death (ICD Code) (pre- 96 CoC) XML NAACCR ID: causeOfDeath PARENT XML ELEMENT: Patient Description Official cause of death as coded from the death certificate in valid ICD -7, ICD -8, ICD -9, and ICD -10 codes. Rationale Cause of death is used for calculation of adjusted survival rates by the life table method. The adjustment corrects for deaths other than from the diagnosed cancer. Codes (in addition to ICD-7, ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10 ) Refer to SEER Manual for additional inst ructions. 0000 Patient alive at last contact 7777 State death certificate not available 7797 State death certificate available but underlying cause of death is not coded 23 CLASS OF CASE Item # Length 610 2 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: classOfCase PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Class of Case divides cases into two groups. Analytic cases (codes 00- 22) are those that are required by CoC to be abstracted because of the program's primary responsibility in managing the cancer. Analytic cases are grouped according to the location of diagnosis and treatment. Treatment and outcome reports may be limited to analytic cases. Nonanalytic cases (codes 30- 49 and 99) may be abstracted by the facility to meet central registry requirements or because of a request by the facility's cancer program. Nonanalytic cases are grouped according to the reason a patient who received care at the facility is nonanalytic, or the reason a patient who never received care at the facility may have been abstracted. Class of Case can be used in conjunction with Type of Reporting Source [500]. Type of Reporting Source is designed to document the source of documents used to abstract the cancer being reported. Rationale Class of Case reflects the facility's role in managing the cancer, whether the cancer is required to be reported by CoC, and whether the case was diagnosed after the program's Reference Date. Codes Analytic Classes of Case Initial diagnosis at reporting facility or in a staff physician's office 00 Initial diagnosis at the reporting facility AND all treatment or a decision not to treat was done elsewhere 10 Initial diagnosis at the reporting facility or in an office of a physician with admitting privileges AND part or all of first course treatment or a decision not to treat was at the reporting facility, NOS 11 Initial diagnosis in an office of a physician with admitting privileges AND part of first course treatment was done at the reporting facility 12 Initial diagnosis in an office of a physician with admitting privileges AND all first course treatment or a decision not to treat was done at the reporti ng facility 24 13 Initial diagnosis at the reporting facility AND part of first course treatment was done at the reporting facility; part of first course treatment was done elsewhere 14 Initial diagnosis at the reporting facility AND all first course treatment or a decision not to treat was done at the reporting facility Initial diagnosis elsewhere 20 Initial diagnosis elsewhere AND all or part of first course treatment was done at the reporting facility, NOS 21 Initial diagnosis elsewhere AND part of first course treatment was done at the reporting facility; part of first course treatment was done elsewhere. 22 Initial diagnosis elsewhere AND all first course treatment or a decision not to treat was done at the reporting facility Non-Analytic Classes of Case Patient appears in person at reporting facility 30 Initial diagnosis and all first course treatment elsewhere AND reporting facility participated in diagnostic workup (for example, consult only, treatment plan only, staging workup after initial diagnosis elsewhere) 31 Initial diagnosis and all first course treatment elsewhere AND reporting facility provided in- transit care; or hospital provided care that facilitated treatment elsewhere (for example, stent placement) 32 Diagnosis AND all first course treatment provided elsewhere AND patient presents at reporting facility with disease recurrence or persistence (active disease) 33 Diagnosis AND all first course treatment provided elsewhere AND patient presents at reporting facility with disease history only (disease not active) 34 Type of case not required by CoC to be accessioned (for example, a benign colon tumor) AND initial d iagnosis AND part or all of first course treatment by reporting facility 35 Case diagnosed before program's Reference Date AND initial diagnosis AND all or part of first course treatment by reporting facility 36 Type of case not required by CoC to be accessioned (for example, a benign colon tumor) AND initial diagnosis elsewhere AND all or part of first course treatment by reporting facility 37 Case diagnosed before program's Reference Date AND initial diagnosis elsewhere AND all or part of first course treatment by facility 38 Initial diagnosis established by autopsy at the reporting facility, cancer not suspected prior to death 25 Patient does not appear in person at reporting facility 40 Diagnosis AND all first course treatment given at the same staff physician's office 41 Diagnosis and all first course treatment given in two or more different offices of physicians with admitting privileges 42 Nonstaff physician or non- CoC accredited clinic or other facility, not part of reporting facility, accessioned by reporting facility for diagnosis and/or treatment by that entity (for example, hospital abstracts cases from an independent radiation facility) 43 Pathology or other lab specimens only 49 Death certificate only 99 Nonanalytic case of unknown relationship to facility (not for use by CoC accredited cancer programs for analytic cases). Examples Code Reason 00 Leukemia was diagnosed at the facility, and all care was given in an office of a physician with practice privileges. The treatment may be abstracted if the cancer committee desires, but the case is Class of Case 00. 13 Breast cancer was diagnosed at the reporting hospital and surgery performed there. Radiation was given at the hospital across the street with which the reporting hospital has an agreement. 10 Reporting hospital found cancer in a biopsy but was unable to discover whether the homeless patient actually received any treatment elsewhere. 32 After treatment failure, the patient was admitted to the facility for supportive care. 11 Patient was diagnosed by a physician with practice privileges, received neoadjuvant radiation at another facility, and then underwent surgical resection at the reporting facility. 42 Patients from an unaffiliated, free- standing clinic across the street that hospital voluntarily abstracts with its cases because many physicians work at both the clinic and the hospital. 31 Patient received chemotherapy while attending daughter's wedding in the reporting hospital's city, then returned to the originating hospital for subsequent treatments. Coding Instructions Source: STORE Manual Code the Class of Case that most precisely describes the patient's relationship to the facility. Code 00 applies only when it is known the patient went elsewhere for treatment. If it is not 26 known that the patient actually w ent somewhere else, code Class of Case 10. It is possible that information for coding Class of Case will change during the patient's first course of care. If that occurs, change the code accordingly. Document NPI -Institution Referred To [2425] or the ap plicable physician NPI (NAACCR #s 2585, 2495, 2505) for patients coded 00 to establish that the patient went elsewhere for treatment Code 34 or 36 if the diagnosis benign or borderline (Behavior 0 or 1) for any site is diagnosed before 2004 or for any sit e other than meninges (C70._), brain (C71._), spinal cord, cranial nerves, and other was diagnosed in 2004 or later. Code 34 or 36 for carcinoma in situ of the cervix (CIS) and intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (8077/2 or 8148/2) of the cervix (CIN III), prostate (PIN III), vulva (VIN III), vagina (VAIN III), and anus (AIN III). Physicians who are not employed by the hospital but are under contract with it or have routine admitting privileges there are described in codes 10- 12 and 41 as physicians with admitting privileges. Treatment provided in the office of a physician with admitting privileges is provided \"elsewhere\". That is b ecause care given in the physician's office is not within the hospital's realm of responsibility. If the hospital purchases a physician practice, it will be necessary to determine whether the practice is now legally considered part of the hospital (their activity is coded as the hospital's) or not. If the practice is not legally part of the hospital, it will be necessary to determine whether the physicians involved have routine admitting privileges or not, as with any other physician. \"In-transit\" care is care given to a patient who is temporarily away from the patient's usual practitioner for continuity of care. If these cases are abstracted, they are Class of Case 31. Monitoring of oral medication started elsewhere is coded Class of Case 31. If a patient begins first course radiation or chemotherapy infusion elsewhere and continues at the reporting facility, and the care is not in- transit, then the case is analytic (Class of Case 21). First course maintenance treatment provided at the reporting facility prior to disease progression or recurrence is reportable IF the maintenance treatment is part of first course treatment plan and is provided by reported facility with documentation of prescription/administration. For example, if a patient is diagnosed and t reated at another facility per the treatment plan was started on hormone therapy at the other facility then presents to your facility for continuation of hormone therapy the continuation of hormone therapy by your facility must be documented in medical rec ord to assign class of case 21 (part of first course treatment elsewhere, part of first course of treatment at the reporting facility). This applies even if there is no longer active disease. 27 COC ACCREDITED FLAG Item # Length 2152 1 XML NAACCR ID: cocAccreditedFlag PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description CoC Accredited Flag is assigned at the point and time of data abstraction to label an abstract being prepared for an analytic cancer case at a facility accredited by the Commission on Cancer (CoC). The flag may be assigned manually or can be defaulted by the registry's software. Rationale It is burdensome for central registries to maintain a list of accredited facilities, and the list changes frequently. The flag is a means of incorporating the accredited status into abstracts at the time of abstraction by someone who has knowledge of the status. The flag thus simplifies validating that required items have been abstracted by CoC -accredited facilities. The flag also allows cases to be stratified during analyses to identify those never seen at a CoC -accredited facility . NPCR will use this flag for facility status stratification. Codes 0 Abstract prepared at a facility WITHOUT CoC accreditation of its cancer program 1 ANALYTIC abstract prepared at facility WITH CoC accreditation of its cancer program (Class of Case codes 10- 22) 2 NON- ANALYTIC abstract prepared at facility WITH CoC accreditation of its cancer program (Class of Case codes 30- 43 and 99, plus code 00) Blank Not applicable; DCO Coding Instructions 1. Assign at the time of data abstraction. 2. Assign manually or automatically assign using registry software. 3. Set the flag to 1 when any of the facilities who contributed to the consolidated data for a cancer record set the CoC Accredited Flag to 1. 4. Set the flag to 2 when all incoming records for the consolidated case have the CoC Accredited Flag set to 2. 5. Set the flag to 0 when all incoming records for the consolidated case have the CoC Accredited Flag set to 0. 6. Set the flag to 2 when incoming records for the consolidated case have the CoC Accredited flag set to 0 and 2. 7. Flag remains blank for DCO cases 28 COUNTY AT DX REPORTED Item # Length 90 3 Alternate Name: County (pre- 96 SEER/CoC) County at Diagnosis (CoC) County at DX XML NAACCR ID: countyAtDx PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Code for the county of the patient's residence at the time of diagnosis as identified by the Reporting Source. For U.S. residents, standard codes are those of the FIPS publication Counties and Equivalent Entities of the United States, Its Possessions, and Associated Areas or their equivalent INCITS codes. Rationale This data item may be used for epidemiological purposes. For example, to measure cancer incidence in a particular geographic area. Codes (in addition to valid FIPS codes) 998 Known town, city, state, or country of residence but county code not known AND a resident outside of the state of reporting institution (must meet all criteria). Use this code for Canadian residents. 999 County unknown. The county of the patient is unknown, or the patient is not a United States resident. County is not documented in the patient's medical record. FIPS Codes See the NAACCR Data Dictionar y for a list of county FIPS codes for all states . Wisconsin County FIPS CODES Adams 001 Iowa 049 Polk 095 Ashland 003 Iron 051 Portage 097 Barron 005 Jackson 053 Price 099 Bayfield 007 Jefferson 055 Racine 101 Brown 009 Juneau 057 Richland 103 Buffalo 011 Kenosha 059 Rock 105 Burnett 013 Kewaunee 061 Rusk 107 29 Calumet 015 La Crosse 063 St. Croix 109 Chippewa 017 Lafayette 065 Sauk 111 Clark 019 Langlade 067 Sawyer 113 Columbia 021 Lincoln 069 Shawano 115 Crawford 023 Manitowoc 071 Sheboygan 117 Dane 025 Marathon 073 Taylor 119 Dodge 027 Marinette 075 Trempealeau 121 Door 029 Marquette 077 Vernon 123 Douglas 031 Menominee 078 Vilas 125 Dunn 033 Milwaukee 079 Walworth 127 Eau Claire 035 Monroe 081 Washburn 129 Florence 037 Oconto 083 Washington 131 Fond du Lac 039 Oneida 085 Waukesha 133 Forest 041 Outagamie 087 Waupaca 135 091 Winnebago 139 Green Lake 047 Pierce 093 Wood 141 Coding Instructions 1. This field is intended to store address information for the patient's physical, residential address. All efforts should be made to find the patient's true street address and postal code, including reviewing relevant sources outside the medical record if available. The county for a PO Box mailing address should only be recorded when no other address information is available in the medical record and no other information sources are available. 2. If the patient has multiple tumors, county at diagnosis may be different for each tumor. 3. If the patient is a non -U.S. resident, use code 999. 4. Do not update this data item if the patient's county of residence changes. 30 DATE CASE COMPLETED Item # Length 2090 8 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: dateCaseCompleted PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description The date that: (1) the abstractor decided that the tumor report was complete and (2) the case passed all edits that were applied. Definitions may vary among registries and software providers. This field is locally used by central registries. Standard edits check that no dates are later than the current date. These specifications will not necessarily be the same as those used for Date Case Completed--CoC [2092]. 31 DATE INITIAL RX SEER Item # Length 1260 8 Alternate Name: Date Therapy Initiated (SEER) Date Started (SEER) Date of Initial RX--SEER XML NAACCR ID: dateInitialRxSeer PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Record the start date of the first course of therapy. This is the start date of any type of treatment for this tumor; surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other types of therapy. Treatment may be given in a hospital or non -hospital setting. Must be transmitted in the YYYYMMDD format. Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Code the start date of the first therapy. The first therapy may be recorded in the following data items: a. Surgery of Primary Site b. Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery (excluding code 1) c. Surgical Procedure of Other Site d. Radiation Treatment Modality --Phase I, II, III e. Chemotherapy f. Hormone Therapy g. Immunotherapy h. Hematologic Transplant and Endocrine Procedures i. Other Therapy 2. Code the date of excisional biopsy when it is the first treatment. Code the date of a biopsy documented as incisional when further surgery reveals no residual or only microscopic residual. a. Example: Breast biopsy with diagnosis of infiltrating duct carcinoma; subsequent re- excision with no residual tumor noted. Code the date of the biopsy . 3. Record the actual date of treatment when treatment is performed prior to birth. Record the type of treatme nt in the appropriate data item, for example, Surgery of Primary Site. a. Example: On 01/03/2022 , fetus is diagnosed with malignant teratoma. The teratoma is resected in utero on 01/10/202 2. Live birth on 04/18/2022 . Code the date as January 10, 202 2 (20220110). 4. Code the date unproven therapy was initiated as the date therapy initiated. 5. Code the date of admission to the hospital for inpatient or outpatient treatment when the exact 32 date of the first treatment is unknown. 6. Leave blank a. When no treatment is giv en during the first course. i. Note : This includes when a patient dies before treatment is recommended or given. b. Treatment Status is coded 2, Active surveillance/watchful waiting. c. It is known the patient had first course therapy, but it is impossible to estimate the date. d. It is unknown whether the patient had treatment . e. It is a death certificate only (DCO) case where the date is unknown and cannot be estimated . f. It is an autopsy only case. Estimating Dates Estimating the month 1. Code \"spring of\" to April . 2. Code \"summer\" or \"middle of the year\" to July . 3. Code \"fall\" or \"autumn\" as October . 4. For \"winter of,\" try to determine whether the physician means the first of the year or the end of the year and code January or December as appropriate. If no determination can be made, use whatever information is available to calculate the month. 5. Code \"early in year\" to January . 6. Code \"late in year\" to December . 7. Use whatever information is available to calculate the month. 8. Code the month of admission when there is no basis for estimation . 9. Leave month blank if there is no basis for approximation. Estimating the year 1. Code \"a couple of years\" to two years earlier . 2. Code \"a few years\" to three years earlier . 3. Use whatever information is available to calculate the year. 4. Code the year of admission when there is no basis for estimation .33 DATE OF 1ST CONTACT Item # Length 580 8 Alternate Name: Date of Adm/First Contact XML NAACCR ID: dateOf1stContact PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Date of first patient contact, as inpatient or outpatient, with the reporting facility for the diagnosis and/or treatment of the tumor. The date may represent the date of an outpatient visit for a biopsy, x - ray, scan, or laboratory test. When pathology -specimen- only tumors are collected (Class of Case 43, Type of Reporting Source 3), the date of specimen collection from the pathology report should be used as the Date of 1st Contact. If a pathology -specimen- only case is followed by patient contact with a facility for diagnosis and/or treatment of the respective tumor, ACoS coding rules require the hospital registry to change the Date of 1st Contact to reflect the date the patient first registered at that facility. Central registries, however, should retain the earlier date in their consolidated files, as that shows the patient's first recorded contact with the healthcare system for this disease. When death certificate only (Class of Case 49, Type of Reporting Source 7) tumors are collected, the date of death should be used as the Date of 1st Contact. When Autopsy Only (Class of Case 38, Type of Reporting Source 6) tumors are collected, the date of death should be used as the Date of 1st Contact. Rationale Timeliness of abstracting (and reporting) i s a concern for all standard- setting organizations. Date of 1st Contact is one of several data items that can be used to measure timeliness of reporting to central cancer registries by individual facilities. For tumors that are not diagnosed at the reporti ng facility following its Reference Date (Class of Case 20- 22, 30- 37), the Date of 1st Contact [580] can be used in conjunction with the Date Case Report Received [2111] to measure timeliness of reporting by individual facilities. To accurately measure the timeliness of data collection and submission of abstracts that are first diagnosed at autopsy (Class of Case 38, Type of Reporting Source 6) the date of death should be used as the Date of 1st Contact since the diagnosis was not determined until the autopsy was performed. Death Certificate Only cases (Class of Case 49, Type of Reporting Source 7) are created only by the central registry. For these cases, Date of 1st Contact should be filled with the date of death, and timeliness for DCO cases should be measured by different criteria. 34 Coding Instructions 1. Record the date the patient first had contact with the facility as either an inpatient or outpatient for diagnosis and/or first course treatment of a reportable tumor. The date may be the date of an outpatient visit for a biopsy, x -ray, or laboratory test, or the date a pathology specimen was collected at the hospital. 2. For analytic cases (Class of Case 00- 22), the Date of First Contact is the date the patient became analytic. For non -analytic cases, it is the date the patient first qualified for the Class of Case that causes the case to be abstracted. 3. If this is an autopsy -only or death certificate- only case, then use the date of death. 4. When a patient is diagnosed in a staff physician's office, the date of first contact is the date the patient was physically first seen at the reporting facility. Examples Code Label Definition 20090914 September 14, 2009 Patient undergoes a biopsy in a staff physician 's office on September 8, 2009. The pathology specimen was sent to the reporting facility and was read as malignant melanoma. The patient enters that same reporting facility on September 14, 2009 for wide re -excision. 20101207 December 7, 2010 Patient has an MRI of the brain on December 7, 2010, for symptoms including severe headache and disorientation. The MRI findings are suspicious for astrocytoma. Surgery on December 19 removes all gross tumor. 201104 April 2011 Informat ion is limited to the description \"Spring,\" 2011. 201107 July 2011 Information is limited to the description \"The middle of the year,\" 2011. 201110 October 2011 Information is limited to the description \"Fall,\" 2011. 35 DATE OF BIRTH Item # Length 240 8 Alternate Name: Birth Date(SEER/CoC/CCCR) XML NAACCR ID: dateOfBirth PARENT XML ELEMENT: Patient Description Date of birth of the patient. If age at diagnosis and year of diagnosis are known, but year of birth is unknown, then year of birth should be calculated and so coded. Only the year should be entered, left - justified. Estimate date of birth when information is not available. It is better to estimate than to leave birth date unknown. Coding Instructions 1. Record the patient's date of birth as indicated in the patient record. For single- digit day or month, record with a lead 0 (for example, September is 09). Use the full four -digit year for year. 2. For in utero diagnosis and treatment, record the actual date of birth. It will follow one or both dates for those events. 3. If only the patient age is available, calculate the year of birth from age and the year of diagnosi s and leave day and month of birth blank (for example, a 60 year old patient diagnosed in 2010 is calculated to have been born in 1950). 36 DATE OF DIAGNOSIS Item # Length 390 8 Alternate Name: Date of Initial Diagnosis (CoC) XML NAACCR ID: dateOfDiagnosis PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Date of initial diagnosis by a recognized medical practitioner for the tumor being reported whether clinically or microscopically confirmed. Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Code the month, day and year the tumor was first diagnosed, clinically or microscopically, by a recognized medical practitioner . a. When the first diagnosis includes reportable ambiguous terminology, record the date of that diagnosis . i. Example: Area of microcalcifications in breast suspicious for malignancy on 02/13/2022 . Biopsy positive for ductal carcinoma on 02/28/202 2. The date of diagnosis 02/13/2022 . 2. When the only information available is a positive pathology or cytology report, code the date the biopsy was done, not the date the report was dictated or transcribed. 3. Code the date the procedure was done, not the date the specimen was received or read as positive by t he pathologist when the date of diagnosis is coded from a pathology report a. Example: Biopsy was performed on 05/06/2023. The specimen from the biopsy was received and read by the pathologist as positive for cancer on 05/09/2023. The date of diagnosis is 05/06/2023. 4. The first diagnosis of cancer may be clinical (i.e., based on clinical findings or physician's documentation) . a. Note: Do not change the date of diagnosis when a clinical diagnosis is subsequently confirmed by positive histology or cytology. b. Example 1: On May 15, 2022 , physician states that patient has lung cancer based on clinical findings. The patient has a positive biopsy of the lung on June 3, 202 2. The date of diagnosis remains May 15, 2022 . c. Example 2: Radiologist reports Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI -RADS) Category 5 on imaging. Later biopsy confirms hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Record date of diag nosis as date of LI -RADS imaging. i. Note: Appendix E in the SEER Manual lists which PI -RADS, BI -RADS, and LI -37 RAD are reportable versus non- reportable. If reportable, use the date of the imaging procedure as the date of diagnosis when this is the earliest date and there is no information to dispute the imaging findings. 5. Posit ive tumor markers alone are not diagnostic of cancer. Use the date of clinical, histologic, or positive cytologic confirmation as the date of diagnosis. a. Example 1: The patient has an elevated PSA, and the physical examination is negative. The physician documents only that the patient is referred for a needle biopsy of the prostate. The biopsy is positive for adenocarcinoma. The date of diagnosis is the date of the biopsy (do not code the date of PSA or date procedure was dictated or transcribed). b. Example 2: The patient has an elevated PSA, and the physical examination is negative. The physician documents that he/she suspects that the patient has prostatic cancer and is referring the patient for a needle biopsy. The needle biopsy is positive, confirming the physician's suspicion of cancer. The date of diagnosis is the date the physician documented that he/she suspects that the patient has prostatic cancer. c. Note: Positive tumor markers alone are never used for case ascertainment. 6. Use the date of suspicious cytology when the diagnosis is proven by subsequent biopsy, excision, or other means. a. Example: Cytology suspicious for malignancy 01/12/2022. Diagnosis of carcinoma per biopsy on 02/06/2022. Record 01/12/2022 as the date of diagnosis. b. Note 1 : \"Suspicious\" cytology means that the diagnosis is preceded by an ambiguous term such as apparently, appears, compatible with, etc. c. Note 2 : Do not use ambiguous cytology alone for case ascertainment . 7. Code the earlier date as the date of diagnosis when: a. A medical pract itioner says that, in retrospect, patient had cancer at an earlier date or b. The original slides are reviewed and the pathologist documents that cancer was present. Code the date of the original procedure as the diagnosis date. i. Example: The patient had an excision of a benign fibrous histiocytoma in January 2022 . Six months later, a wide re- excision was positive for malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The physician documents in the chart that the previous tumor must have been malignant. Code the diagnosis date as January 2022 . ii. Note: Do not back -date the dia gnosis when: 1. The information on the previous tumor is unclear AND/OR 2. There is no r eview of previous slides AND/OR 3. There is no physician's statement that, in retrospect, the previous tumor was malignant . iii. Example: The patient had a total hysterectomy and a bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy (BSO) in June 2022 with pathology diagnosis of papillary cystadenoma of the ovaries. In December 2022 , the patient is diagnosed with widespread metastatic papillary cystadenocarcinoma. The slides from June 202 2 are not reviewed and there is no physician statement saying the previous tumor was malignant. The date of diagnosis is December 2022 . 8. Code the date of death as the date of diagnosis for autopsy -only cases. 38 9. Death certificate only (DCO) Cases . a. Use information on the death certificate to estimate the date of diagnosis . b. Record the date of death as the date of diagnosis when there is not enough information available to estimate the date of diagnosis; for example, the time from onset to the date of death is described as ' years . c. If no information is available, record the date of death as the date of diagnosis . 10. Estimate the date of diagnosis if an exact date is not available. Use all informat ion available to calculate the month and year of diagnosis. a. Estimating the month i. Code \"spring\" to April . ii. Code \"summer\" or \"middle of the year\" to July . iii. Code \"fall\" or \"autumn\" as October . iv. For \"winter\" try to determine whether the physician means the first of the year or the end of the year and code January or December as appropriate. If no determination can be made, use whatever information is available to calculate the month of diagnosis. v. Code \"early in year\" to January . vi. Code \"late in year\" to December . vii. Use whatever information is available to calculate the month of diagnosis . 1. Example 1: Admitted October 202 2. History states that the patient was diagnosed 7 months ago. Subtract 7 from th e month of admission and code date of diagnosis to March 2022 . 2. Example 2: Outpatient bone scan done January 202 2 that states history of prostate cancer. The physician says the patient was diagnosed in 2022 . Assume bone scan was part of initial work -up and code date of diagnosis to January 202 2 viii. Code the month of admission when there is no basis for estimation . ix. Leave month blank (or convert 99 to blank) if there is no basis for approximation. b. Estimating the year. i. Code \"a couple of years\" to two years earli er. ii. Code \"a few years\" to three years earlier . iii. Use whatever information is available to calculate the year of diagnosis . iv. Code the year of admission when there is no basis for estimation . Nursing Home and Hospice Residents (Not hospitalized for their cancer; no information other than nursing home or hospice records and/or death certificate) . 1. Use the best approximation for the date of diagnosis when the only information available is that the patient had cancer while in the nursing home and it is unknown whether the patient had cancer when admitted. 39 2. Code the date of admission to the nursing home as the date of diagnosis when: a. The only information available is that the patient had cancer when admitted to the nursing home. b. The only information avai lable is that the patient had cancer while in the nursing home, it is unknown whether the patient had cancer when admitted, and there is no basis for approximation. Cases Diagnosed Before Birth 1. Record the actual date of diagnosis for diagnoses made in ut ero even though this date will precede the date of birth. a. Example: Fetal intrahepatic mass consistent with hepatoblastoma diagnosed via ultrasound at 39 weeks gestation (01/30/202 2). Live birth by C -section 02/04/2022 . Code the date of diagnosis as 01/30/ 2022. b. Note: Prenatal diagnoses are reportable when there is a live birth.40 DATE OF LAST CONTACT Item # Length 1750 8 Alternate Name: Date of Last Contact or Death (CoC) Date of Last Follow- Up or of Death (SEER) XML NAACCR ID: dateOfLastContact PARENT XML ELEMENT: Patient Description Date of last contact with the patient, or date of death. If the patient has multiple tumors, Date of Last Contact should be the same for all tumors. Rationale Used for recording Date of Last Contact from active or passive follow -up. Used to record date of death and to calculate survival. Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Code the date the patient was actually seen by the physician or contacted by the hospital registry as the follow -up date. Do not code the date the follow -up report was received. 2. Do not change the follow -up date unless new information is available 3. The data item is associated with the patient, not the cancer, so all records (primary sites) for the same patient will have the same follow -up date 4. Record the date of death for deceased patients a. Death certificate only (DCO) cases b. Autopsy only cases Estimating Dates Source: SEER Manual Estimating the month 1. Code \"spring of\" to April . 2. Code \"summer\" or \"middle of the year\" to July . 3. Code \"fall\" or \"autumn\" as October . 4. For \"winter of,\" try to determine whether the physician means the first of the year or the end of the year and code January or December as appropriate. If no determination can be made, use whatever information is available to calculate the month. 41 5. Code \"early in year\" to January . 6. Code \"late in year\" to December . 7. Use whatever information is available to calculate the month. 8. Code the month of admission when there is no basis for estimation . 9. Leave month blank if there is no basis for approximation. Estimating the year 1. Code \"a couple of years\" to two years earlier . 2. Code \"a few years\" to three years earlier . 3. Use whatever information is available to calculate the year . 42 DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION Item # Length 490 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: diagnosticConfirmation PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Code for the best method of diagnostic confirmation of the cancer being reported at any time throughout the entire course of the disease. Rationale Diagnostic confirmation is useful to calculate rates based on microscopically confirmed cancers. Full incidence calculations must also include tumors that are only confirmed clinically. The percentage of tumors that not micro scopically confirmed is an indication of whether case finding is including sources outside of pathology reports. Codes for Solid Tumors Microscopically Confirmed Code Description 1 Positive histology 2 Positive cytology 4 Positive microscopic confirmation, method not specified Not Microscopically Confirmed Code Description 5 Positive laboratory test/marker study 6 Direct visualization without microscopic confirmation 7 Radiography or other imaging techniques without microscopic confirmation 8 Clinical diagnosis only (other than 5, 6, or 7) Confirmation Unknown Code Description 9 Unknown whether or not microscopically confirmed; death certificate only 43 Coding Instructions for Solid Tumors Source: SEER Manual 1. The codes are in priority order ; code 1 has the highest priority. Always code the procedure with the lower numeric value when presence of cancer is confirmed with multiple diagnostic methods. 2. Change to a higher -priority code, if at ANY TIME during the course of disease the patient has a diagnostic confirmation with a higher priority . Change to the higher -priority code even when diagnostic confirmation is based on the result of subsequent treatm ent. a. Example: Benign brain tumor diagnosed on MRI. Assign diagnostic confirmation code 7. Patient later becomes symptomatic, and the tumor is surgically removed. Change diagnostic confirmation code to 1. 3. Assign code 1 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on: a. Tissue specimens from fine needle aspirate, biopsy, surgery, autopsy, or D&C . b. Bone marrow specimens (aspiration and biopsy). 4. Assign code 2 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on: a. Examination of cells (rather than tissue) including but not limited to peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, urinary sediment, cervical smears, or vaginal smears . b. Paraffin block specimens from concentrated spinal, pleural, or peritoneal fluid. 5. Assign code 4 when there is information that the diagnosis of cancer was mi croscopically confirmed, but the type of confirmation is unknown. 6. Assign code 5 when the diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests or tumor marker studies that are clinically diagnostic for that specific cancer and there is no other diagnostic work up (e.g., imaging) . a. Example: If the workup for a prostate cancer patient is limited to a highly elevated PSA (no DRE and no imaging) and the physician diagnoses and/or treats the patient based only on that PSA, code the diagnostic confirmation to 5. b. Note: For tests and tumor markers that may be used to help diagnose cancer, see http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/tumor -markers 7. Assign code 6 when the diagnosis is based only on: a. The surgeon's operative report from a surgical exploration or endoscopy such as colonoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or peritoneoscopy and no tissue was examined. b. Gross autopsy findings (no tissue or cytologic confirmation) . 8. Assign code 7 when the only confirmation of malignancy was diagnostic imaging such as computerized axial tomography (CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scans), or ultrasounds/sonography . 9. Assign code 8 when the case was diagnosed by any clinical method not mentioned in preceding codes. The diagnostic confirmation is coded 8 when the only confirmation of disease is a physician's clinical diagnosis. 44 a. Example: CT diagnosis is possible lung cancer. Patient returns to the nursing home with a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order. Physician enters a diagnosis of lung cancer in the medical record. Code the diagnostic confirmation to 8: there is a physician's clinical diagnosis - clinical diagnosis made by the physician using the information available for the case. 10. Assign code 9. a. When it is unknown if the diagnosis was confirmed microscopically . b. For death certificate only case. Codes for Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms (9590/3 -9993/3) Microscopically Confirmed Code Positive histology 2 Positive cytology 3 Positive histology PLUS - positive immunophenotyping AND/OR positive genetic studies (Used only for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms M -9590/3- 9992/3) 4 Positive microscopic confirmation, method not specified Not Microscopically Confirmed Code Description 5 Positive laboratory test/marker study 6 Direct visualization without microscopic confirmation 7 Radiography and/or other imaging techniques without microscopic confirmation 8 Clinical diagnosis only (other than 5, 6, or 7) Confirmation Unknown Code Description 9 Unknown whether or not microscopically confirmed; death certificate only Coding Instructions for Hematopoietic (9590/3 -9993/3) See the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database for coding instructions. 45 ESOPHAGUS AND EGJ TUMOR EPICENTER Item # Length 3829 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: esophagusAndEgjTumorEpicenter Junction (EGJ), Squamous Cell (including adenosquamous), Tumor Location refers to the position of the epicenter of the tumor in the esophagus.

For cases diagnosed January 1, 2018, and later, this data item, along with Grade Pathological and Grade Post -Neoadjuvant, replaces NAACCR Data Item Grade [440] as well as SSF's for cancer sites with alternative grading systems (e.g., breast [Bloom -Richardson], prostate [Gleason]). Rationale Grade is a measure of the aggressiveness of the tumor. Grade and cell type are important prognostic indicators for many cancers. For some sites, grade is required to assign the clinical stage group. For those cases that are eligible AJCC staging, the recommended grading system is specified in the AJCC Chapter. The AJCC Chapter -specific grading systems (codes 1 -5) take priority over the generic grade definitions (codes A -E, L, H, 9). For those cases that are not eligible for AJCC staging, if the recommended grading system is not documented, the generic grade definitions would apply. Codes Refer to the Grade Manual for site -specific tables, instruction, and additional notes. Coding Guidelines Source: Grade Manual Note 1 : Grade Clinical must not be blank. Note 2 : Assign the highest grade from the primary tumor assessed during the clinical time frame. Note 3 : If there are multiple tumors with different grades abstracted as one primary, code the highest grade. Note 4 : Code 9 (unknown) when: o Grade from primary site is not documented . o Clinical workup is not done (for example, cancer is an incidental finding during surgery for another condition) . 58 o Grade checked \"not applicable\" on CAP Protocol (if available) and no other grade information is available .

If AJCC staging is being assigned, the tumor must have met the surgical resection requirements in the AJCC manual. This may include the grade from the clinical workup. Record the highest grade documented from any microscopic specimen of the primary site whether from the clinical workup or the surgical resection. For cases diagnosed January 1, 2018, and later, this data item, along with Grade Clinical and Grade Post- Neoadjuvant, replaces NAACCR Data Item Grade [440] as well as SSF's for cancer sites with alternative grading systems (e.g., breast [Bloom -Richardson], prostate [Gleason]). Rationale Grade is a measure of the aggressiveness of the tumor. Grade and cell type are important prognostic indicators for many cancers. For some sites, grade is required to assign the pathological stage group. For those cases that are eligible AJCC staging, the recommended grading system is specified in the AJCC Chapter. The AJCC Chapter -specific grading systems (codes 1 -5) take priority over the generic grade definitions (codes A -E, L, H, 9). For those cases that are not eligible for AJCC staging, if the recommended grading system is not documented, the generic grade definitions would apply. Codes Refer to the Grade Manual for site -specific tables, instruction, and additional notes. Coding Guidelines Source: Grade Manual Note 1 : Pathological grade is recorded for cases where a surgical resection has been done. Note 2 : Pathological grade must not be blank. Note 3 : Assign the highest grade from the primary tumor. If the clinical grade is the highest grade identified, use the grade that was identified during the clinical time frame for both the clinical grade and the pathological grade. (This follows the AJCC rule that pathological time frame includes all of the clinical time frame information plus information from the resected specimen.) o If a resection is done of a primary tumor and there is no grade documented from the 60 surgical resection, use the grade from the clinical workup. o If a resection is done of a primary tumor and there is no residual cancer, use the grade from the clinical workup . Note 4 : Code 9 (unknown) when: o Grade not documented . o No resection of the primary site . o Neoadjuvant therapy followed by a resection (see post therapy grade. ) o Clinical case only (see clinical grade) . o There is only one grade available, and it cannot be determined if it is clinical or pathological. o Grade checked \"not applicable\" on CAP Protocol (if available) and no other grade information is available . 61 GRADE POST THERAPY CLIN (YC) Item # Length 1068 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: gradePostTherapyClin PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description This data item records the grade of a solid primary tumor that has been microscopically sampled following neoadjuvant therapy or primary systemic/radiation therapy. If AJCC staging is being assigned, the tumor must have met the neoadjuvant therapy or primary systemic/radiation therapy requirements in the AJCC manual or according to national treatment guidelines. Record the highest grade documented from the microscopically sampled specimen of the primary site following neoadjuvant therapy or primary systemic/radiation therapy. For cases diagnosed January 1, 2020, and later, this data item, along with Grade Clinical, Grade Pathological, and Grade Post Therapy Path (yp), replaces NAACCR Data Item Grade [440] as well as SSF's for cancer sites with alternative grading systems (e.g., breast [Bloom -Richardson], prostate [Gleason]). Rationale Grade is a measure of the aggressiveness of the tumor. Grade and cell type are important prognostic indicators for many cancers. For some sites, grade is required to assign the post therapy stage group. For those cases that are eligible for AJCC staging, the recommended grading system is specified in the AJCC Cha pter. The AJCC Chapter -specific grading systems (codes 1 -5, L, H, M, S) take priority over the generic grade definitions (codes A -E, 9). For those cases that are not eligible for AJCC staging, if the recommended grading system is not documented, the generic grade definitions would apply. Codes Refer to the Grade Manual for site -specific tables, instruction, and additional notes. Coding Guidelines Source: Grade Manual Note 1 : Leave Grade Post Therapy Clin (yc) blank when: o No neoadjuvant therapy . o or pathological case only . o Neoadjuvant therapy completed; no microscopic exam is done prior to surgery/resection of primary tumor . 62 o There is only one grade available, and it cannot be determined if it is clinical, pathological, post therapy clin or post therapy path. Note 2 : Assign the highest grade from the microscopically sampled specimen of the primary site following neoadjuvant therapy or primary systemic/radiatio n therapy. Note 3 : If there are multiple tumors with different grades abstracted as one primary, code the highest grade. Note 4 : Code 9 (unknown) when: o Microscopic exam is done after neoadjuvant therapy and grade from the primary site is not documented. o Microscopic exam is done after neoadjuvant therapy and there is no residual cancer . o Grade checked \"not applicable\" on CAP Protocol (if available) and no other grade information is available . 63 GRADE POST THERAPY PATH (YP) Item # Length 3845 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: gradePostTherapy PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description This data item records the grade of a solid primary tumor that has been resected following neoadjuvant therapy. If AJCC staging is being assigned, the tumor must have met the surgical resection requirements in the AJCC manual. Record the highest grade documented from the surgical treatment resection specimen of the primary site following neoadjuvant therapy. For cases diagnosed January 1, 2018, and later, this data item, along with Grade Clinical and Grade Pathological, replaces NAACCR Data Item Grade [440] as well as SSF's for cancer sites with alternative grading systems (e.g., breast [Bloom -Richardson], prostate [Gleason]). Rationale Grade is a measure of the aggressiveness of the tumor. Grade and cell type are important prognostic indicators for many cancers. For some sites, grade is required to assign the post -neoadjuvant stage group. For those cases that are eligible AJCC staging, the recommended grading system is specified in the AJCC Chapter. The AJCC Chapter -specific grading systems (codes 1 -5) take priority over the generic grade definitions (codes A -E, L, H, 9). For those cases that are not eligible for AJCC staging, if the recommended grading system is not documented, the generic grade definitions would apply. Codes Refer to the Grade Manual for site -specific tables, instruction, and additional notes. Coding Guidelines Source: Grade Manual Note 1 : Leave Grade Post Therapy Path (yp) blank when: o No neoadjuvant therapy . o Clinical or pathological case only. o Neoadjuvant therapy completed; surgical resection not done. o There is only one grade available, and it cannot be determined if it is clinical, pathological, post therapy clin or post therapy path. Note 2 : There is a preferred grading system for this schema. If the post therapy clinical grade given uses the preferre d grading system and the post therapy pathological grade does not use 64 the preferred grading system, do not record the Grade Post Therapy Clin (yc) in the Grade Post Therapy Path (yp) field. o Example: Neoadjuvant therapy completed. Biopsy of primary site sh ows a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The surgical resection states a high grade adenocarcinoma. Grade Clinical Post Therapy (yc) would be coded as G2 (code 2) since Moderately Differentiated is the preferred grading system . Grade Path Post Therapy (yp) would be coded as 9 since the preferred grading system was not used and the Generic Grade Categories do not apply to this grade table. Note 3 : Assign the highest grade from the resected primary tumor assessed after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Note 4 : If there are multiple tumors with different grades abstracted as one primary, code the highest grade. Note 5 : Use the grade from the post therapy clinical work up from the primary tumor in different scenarios based on behavior or surgical resection . o Behavior Tumor behavior for the post therapy clinical and the post therapy pathological diagnoses are the same AND the post therapy clinical grade is the highest grade. Tumor behavior for post therapy clinical diagnosis is invasive, and the tumor behavior for the post therapy pathological diagnosis is in situ. o Surgical Resection Surgical resection is done of the primary tumor after neoadjuvant therapy is completed and there is no grade documented from the surgical resection. Surgical resection is done of the primary tumor after neoadjuvant therapy is completed and there is no residual cancer . Surgical resection of the primary tumor after neoadjuvant therapy is completed is not done, but there is positive microscopic confirmation of distant metastases during the post therapy clinical time frame. Note 6 : Code 9 (unknown) when: o Surgical resection is done after neoadjuvant therapy and grade from the primary site is not documented. o Surgical resection is done after neoadjuvant therapy and there is no residual cancer . o Grade checked \"not applicable\" on CAP Protocol (if available) and no other grade information is available . 65 HER2 OVERALL SUMMARY Item # Length 3855 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: her2OverallSummary PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description HER2 Overall Summary is a summary of results from HER2 testing. Rationale This data item is required for prognostic stage grouping in AJCC 8th edition, Chapter 48, Breast. It was previously collected as Breast, CS SSF # 15. Experts recommend that every invasive breast cancer be tested for the presence of HER2 because anti -HER2 t reatments are highly effective for these tumors. HER2 overall summary It will be collected for Esophagus and Esophagogastric Junction and Stomach for cases diagnosed 1/1/21+ because NCCN guidelines recommend HER2 testing at time of diagnosis if patients are documented or suspected of having metastatic disease. HER2 monoclonal antibodies may be added to chemotherapy for patients with HER2 positive disease. Codes Each Site -Specific Data Item (SSDI) applies only to selected primary sites, histologies, and year s of diagnosis. Depending on applicability and standard- setter requirements, SSDIs may be left blank. 0 HER2 negative; equivocal 1 HER2 positive 7 Test ordered, results not in chart 8 Not applicable: Information not collected for this case 9 Not documented in medical record Cannot be determined (indeterminate) HER2 Overall Summary status not assessed or unknown if assessed Blank NA - Diagnosis year prior to 2021 Coding Instructions Refer to the SSDI Manual for applicable schemas and coding instructions. 66 HISTOLOGIC SUBTYPE Item # Length 3960 1 Alternate Name: ID: histologicSubtype PARENT Tumor Description appendiceal tumors (8480) is defined as \"Mucinous Adenocarcinoma (in situ or invasive).\" In the AJCC 8th chapter for Appendix -Carcinoma, there are also low high- grade appendiceal diagnoses that are assigned the same histology. Due to the different natures of these histologies, there is interest in tracking these different types of tumors. With the current histology codes, a distinction cannot be made. A histology subtype data item is needed. for 8480 7 Histology is NOT 8480 Coding Instructions Refer to the SSDI Manual for applicable schemas and coding instructions. 67 HISTOLOGIC TYPE ICD-O-3 Item # Length 522 XML NAACCR ID: Tumor Description Codes for the histologic type of the tumor being reported using ICD -O-3.

Apply the site- specific histology coding rules in the current Solid Tumor Rules. Refer to the most current Solid Tumor Rules for histology code changes. 1. Beginning with cases diagnosed 01/01/2022, p16 test results can be used to code squamous cell carcinoma, HPV positive (8085) and squamous cell carcinoma, HPV negative (8086). 2. Beginning with cases diagnosed 01/ 01/2022, non- keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, HPV positive is coded 8085 for sites listed in Head and Neck Solid Tumor Rules Table 5 only. A diagnosis of non- keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, NOS is coded 8072. 3. Beginning with cases diagnosed 0 1/01/2022, keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, HPV negative is coded 8086 for sites listed in Head and Neck Solid Tumor Rules Table 5 only. A diagnosis of keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, NOS is coded 8071. 4. Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma is coded 8323/3. The 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Urinary System and Male Genital Organs, 4th Edition, reclassified this histology as a /1 because it is low nuclear grade and is now thought to be a neoplasia. 68 This change has not yet been implemented and it remains reportable as behavior /3.

Assign code 3 if the laterality is not known but the tumor is confined to a single side of the paired organ. i. Example: Pathology report: Patient has a 2 cm carcinoma in the upper pole of the kidney. Code laterality as 3 because there is documentation that the disease exists in only one kidney, but it is unknown if the disease originated in the right or left kidney. 4. Code 4 is seldom used EXCEPT for the following : a. Both ovaries involved simultaneously with a single histology , or epithelial histologies (8000- 8799) retinoblastomas . d. Bilateral Wilms tumors . 5. Assign code 5 when the tumor originates in the midline of a site listed Do code 5 to sites not listed in 5.a . 1.

When cells (normal or tumor) are damaged or destroyed, an enzyme called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is released into the bloodstream. LDH is an indirect indication of possible tumor burden or damage to an organ, which may be caused by metastatic involvement of liver or lung, or a myocardial infarction. The total LDH should be the test value that is coded, but there are five fractions of LDH that measure tissue specific cellular damage: LD1 and LD2: heart, red blood cells and kidneys; LD3: lung; LD4 and LD5: liver, skin and skeletal muscles. LDH is elevated in 60% of patients with non-seminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis. LDH is not screening test, nor is it diagnostic of melanoma, ocular adnexal lymphoma, or testicular cancer. Rationale LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) Lab Value is a Registry Data Collection Variable in AJCC. It was previously collected as LDH Pretreatment Lab Value and Melanoma Skin, CS SSF# 5. Codes Each Site -Specific Data Item (SSDI) applies only to selected primary sites, histologies, and years of diagnosis.

LVI includes lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, and lymphovascular invasion. Rationale Presence or absence of cancer cells in the lymphatic ducts or blood vessels is useful for prognosis. CAP Protocols for some disease sites will be expanded to distinguish between lymphatic and small vessel invasion only, venous (large vessel) invasion only, and BOTH lymphatic and small vessel AND venous (large vessel) invasion. Codes 0 Lymphovascular Invasion stated as Not Present 1 Lymphovascular Invasion Present/Identified (NOT used for thyroid and adrenal) 2 Lymphatic and small vessel invasion only (L) OR Lymphatic invasion only (thyroid and adrenal only) 3 Venous (large vessel) invasion only (V) OR Angioinvasion (thyroid and adrenal only) 4 BOTH lymphatic and small vessel AND venous (large vessel) invasion OR BOTH lymphatic and angioinvasion (thyroid and adrenal only) 8 Not applicable 9 Unknown/Indeterminate/not mentioned in path report 79 Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Code from pathology report(s). I f not available, code the absence or presence of lymphovascular invasion as described in the medical record. a. The primary source of information about lymphovascular invasion is the pathology check list (synoptic report) developed by the College of American Pathologists. If the case does not have a checklist or synoptic report, code from other sections of the pathology report or a physician's statement, in that order. 2. Code lymphovascular invasion to 0, 2, 3, 4, or 9 for the following Schema IDs a. Thyroid 0073 0 b. Thyroid Medullary 00740 c. Adrenal Gland 00760 3. Do not code perineural invasion in this data item . 4. Use the pathology report for any specimen from the primary site to code this data item (biopsy or resection) . 5. Code as present/identified when lymphovascular invasion is identified in any primary tumor specimen. 6. Use the table below for cases treated with neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy. Code lymphovascular invasion based on the documentation in the medical record when documentation in the medical record conf licts with this table. LVI on pathology report PRIOR to neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy LVI on pathology report AFTER neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy Code LVI to 0 - Not present/Not identified 0 - Not present/Not identified 0 - Not present/Not identified 0 - Not present/Not identified 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 0 - Not present/Not identified 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 1 - Present/Identified 0 - Not present/Not identified 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 1 - Present/Identified 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 0 - Not present/Not identified 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 1 - Present/Identified 1 - Present/Identified 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 9 - Unknown/Indeterminate 7.

When there is no residual tumor found after neoadjuvant treatment and there is no LVI on biopsy 8. Use code 1 when the pathology report or a physician's statement indicates that lymphovascular invasion (or one of its synonyms) is present in the specimen. a. Synonyms include, but are not limited to: i. Angiolymphatic invasion ii. Blood vessel invasion iii. Lymph vascular emboli iv. Lymphatic invasion v. Lymphvascular invasion vi. Vascular invasion vii. Lymphovascular space invasion 9. Use code 8: a. For the following Schemas/Schema IDs : i. GIST Cell Myeloma 00821 ix. Primary Cutaneous Lymphoma (excluding MF and SS) 00812 x. For more information about schemas and schema IDs, see the SSDI Manual b. For non- malignant brain (intracranial) and CNS tumors c. When standard- setter does not require this item and state/central registry is not collecting it. 10. Use code 9 when : a. There is no microscopic examination of a primary tissue specimen. b. The primary site specimen is cytology only or a fine needle aspiration. c. The biopsy is only a very small tissue sample . d. It is not possible to determine whether lymphovascular invasion is present . e. The pathologist indicates the specimen is insufficient to determine lymphovascular invasion. f. Lymphovascular invasion is not mentioned in the pathology report . 81 g. There is no information/documentation from the pathology report or other sources . h. Primary site is unknown. i. Ambiguous terminology is used i. Example: Assign code 9 for \"suspicious LVI\" 82 MARITAL STATUS AT DX Item # Length 150 1 Alternate Name: Marital Status at Diagnosis (SEER/CoC) Marital Status at Initial Diagnosis (pre-96 CoC) XML NAACCR ID: maritalStatusAtDx PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Code for the patient's marital status at the time of diagnosis for the reportable tumor.

The MBI will be a randomly generated identifier that will not include an SSN or any personal identifiable information. Rationale The MBI is a step to minimize the risk of identity theft for Medicare beneficiaries and reduce opportunities for fraud. In early 2018, CMB plans to issue new Medicare cards with an MBI. A Health Insurance Claim Number will still be assigned to each Medicare beneficiary and will still be used for internal data exchanges between CMS and the states, but the new MBI must be used in all interactions with the beneficiary, the provider community and all external partners. The collection of the MBI should not change how registries currently collect SSN. Codes (in addition to MBI) Blank Not Available, Non -Medicare Patient, Not Applicable, or Unknown Note: The Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) is randomly generated and has 11 characters, consisting of numbers and letters, entered without dashes.

High MSI, found in about 15% of colorectal carcinomas, is an adverse prognostic factor for colorectal carcinomas and predicts poor response to 5- FU chemotherapy (although the addition of oxaliplatin in FOLFOX regimens negates the adverse effects [page 266 AJCC manual]). High MSI is a hallmark of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma, also known as Lynch syndrome. Microsatellite instability is found most often in colorectal cancer, other types of gastrointestinal cancer, and endometrial cancer. It may also be found in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, and thyroid. Knowing whether cancer is microsatellite instability high may help plan the best treatment. Rationale Microsatellite Instability (MSI) is a Registry Data Collection Variable in AJCC. It was previously collected as Colon and Rectum, CS SSF# 7. Codes Each Site -Specific Data Item (SSDI) applies only to selected primary sites, histologies, and years of diagnosis. Depending on applicability and standard- setter requirements, SSDIs may be left blank. 0 Microsatellite instability (MSI) stable; microsatellite stable (MSS); negative, NOS AND/OR Mismatch repair (MMR) intact, no loss of nuclear expression of MMR proteins MMR proficient (pMMR or MMR -P) 1 MSI unstable low (MSI -L) 2 MSI unstable high (MSI -H) AND/OR MMR -D (dMMR or MMR -D), loss of nuclear expression of one or more MMR proteins, MMR protein deficient 8 Not applicable: Information not collected for this case (If this information is required by your standard setter, use of code 8 may result in an edit error ) 99 9 Not documented in medical record MSI-indeterminate MSI-equivocal Microsatellite instability not assessed or unknown if assessed Coding Instructions Refer to the SSDI Manual for applicable schemas and coding instructions. 100 MORPH CODING SYS-- CURRENT Item # Length 470 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: morphCodingSysCurrent PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Code that best describes how morphology is currently coded.

The p16 biomarker is overexpressed (produced) in response to HPV. It is therefore a surrogate marker for HPV disease. Rationale Patients with HPV have a different survival or outcome, so it is important to be able to distinguish this by documenting the p16 results. Testing is performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) which is inexpensive and has near universal availability. It has an easily standardized interpretation. HPV testing is usually performed through DNA testing which is more expensive and less widely available. HPV testing also has technically more variability with the interpretation. P16 is a tumor suppressor protein also known as cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor 2A. The p16 biomarker is over -expressed (produced) in response to HPV. It is therefore a surrogate marker for HPV disease. Codes 0 p16 Negative; Nonreactive 1 p16 Positive; Diffuse, Strong reactivity 8 Not applicable: Information not collected for this case 9 Not tested for p16; Unknown Blank N/A - Diagnosis year prior to 2021 Coding Instructions Refer to the SSDI Manual for applicable schemas and coding instructions. 126 PHASE I RADIATION TREATMENT MODALITY Item # Length 1506 2 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: phase1RadiationTreatmentModality PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Identifies the radiation modality administered during the first phase of radiation treatment delivered as part of the first course of treatment. IMPORTANT: Make sure to justify the code you enter in this field by completing the associated radiation text f ield. Rationale Radiation modality reflects whether a treatment was external beam, brachytherapy, a radioisotope as well as their major subtypes, or a combination of modalities. This data item should be used to indicate the radiation modality administered during the first phase of radiation. Historically, the previously named Regional Treatment Modality data item [1570] utilized codes that were not mutually exclusive. Rather, it included codes describing a mix of modalities, treatment planning techniques, and delivery techniques that are commonly utilized by radiation oncologists. However, every phase of radiation treatment will include a specific modality, planning technique, and delivery technique. The goal of the 2018 implementation of separate phase- spec ific data items for the recording of radiation modality and radiation treatment planning techniques is to clarify this information and implement mutually exclusive categories. A separate data item for delivery technique has not been implemented because this information is not consistently reported in end treatment summaries. Codes 00 No radiation treatment 01 External beam, NOS 02 External beam, photons 03 External beam, protons 04 External beam, electrons 05 External beam, neutrons 06 External beam, carbon ions Radiation therapy administered but treatment modality is not specified or unknown 99 Unknown if radiation treatment administered Coding Instructions Source: STORE Manual 1. Radiation treatment modality will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's treatment summary for the firs t course of treatment. Segregation of treatment components into Phases and determination of the respective treatment modality may require assistance from the radiation oncologist to ensure consistent coding. 2. For purposes of this data item, photons, x -rays and gamma- rays are equivalent. 3. Use code 13 - Radioisotopes, NOS for radioembolization procedures, e.g., intravascular Yttrium -90 for cases diagnosed January 1, 2018, or later. For cases diagnosed prior January 1, 2018, use code 07- Brachytherapy, NOS. 4. This data item intentionally does not include reference to various MV energies because this is not a clinically important aspect of technique. A change in MV energy (e.g., 6MV to 12MV) is not clinically relevant and does not represent a change in treatment technique. It is rare for change in MV energy to occur during any phase of radiation therapy. 5. If this data item is coded to any of the External beam codes (01- 06 or 12), the planning technique must be recorded in the data item Phase I -II-III External Beam Radiation Planning Technique [1502, 1512 , 1522]. 6. If Radiation Treatment Modality is coded to any of the Brachytherapy or Radioisotopes codes (07-16) the code of 88 must be recorded in the data item Phase I -II-III External Beam Radiation Planning Technique [1502, 1512, 1522]. a. Note: Do not confuse a radioiodine scan with treatment. Only treatment is recorded in this item. 7. Phase I must be coded , however blanks allowed for Phase II -III if no treatment administered. 128 PHYSICIAN --FOLLOW -UP Item # Length 2470 8 Alternate Name: Follow- ID: physicianFollowUp PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Code for the physician currently responsible for the patient's medical care. WCRS requires use of Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services ( DSPS) a ssigned codes. You can search and verify Wisconsin DSPS -assigned codes on the DSPS site . Rationale Used to monitor post -treatment patient care. Codes in addition DSPS Physician Number 99999999 OR Blank Non-physician, physician unknown, or no DSPS Wisconsin license number 129 PLACE OF DEATH--COUNTRY Item # Length 1944 3 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: placeOfDeathCountry PARENT XML ELEMENT: Patient Description Code for the country in which the patient died and where certificate of death is filed. If the patient has multiple tumors, all records should contain the same code. This data item became part of the NAACCR transmission record effective with Volume II, Version 13 in order to include country and state for each geographic item and to use interoperable codes. It supplements the item Place of Death--State [1942]. It replaces the use of Place of Death [1940]. Rationale Place of death is helpful for carrying out death clearance. When a reporting facility reports a place of death that is outside of the registry's country, the information can signal a death for which the death certificate will not be available from another state or through the NDI linkage. Codes (In addition to valid County Codes) Use the International Standards Organization (ISO) 3166- 1 Country Three Character Codes, whenever possible, augmented by custom codes. See SEER Manual , Append ix B for complete list of country names and corresponding three character alpha codes. ZZN North America NOS ZZC Central America NOS ZZS South America NOS ZZP Pacific NOS ZZE Europe NOS ZZF Africa NOS ZZA Asia NOS ZZX Non-US NOS ZZU Unknown 130 PLACE OF DEATH--STATE Item # Length 1942 2 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: placeOfDeathState PARENT XML ELEMENT: Patient Description State or Province where the patient died and where certificate of death is filed. This data item became part of the NAACCR transmission record effective with Volume II, Version 13 in order to include country and state for each geographic item and to use interoperable codes. It supplements the item PLACE OF DEATH --COUNTRY [1944]. It replaces the use of PLACE OF DEATH [1940]. Rationale This field also helps carry out death clearance. When a reporting facility reports a place of death, the information can help in death certificate matching. It can also signal an out -of-state death for which the death cert ificate is to be requested. Codes (in addition to Valid State Code) Blank Not applicable, patient alive See Appendix B of the SEER Manual for numeric and alphabetic lists of places and codes. 131 PRIMARY PAYER AT DX Item # Length 630 2 Alternate Name: Primary Payer at Diagnosis (CoC) XML NAACCR ID: primaryPayerAtDx PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Primary payer/insurance carrier at the time of initial diagnosis and/or treatment at the reporting facility.

Assign code 99 for death certificate only (DCO) cases when the primary payer at diagnosis is unknown. 134 PRIMARY SITE Item # Length 400 4 Alternate Name: IDC-O- 2/3 Topography (CCCR) XML NAACCR ID: primarySite PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Code for the primary site of the tumor being reported using either ICD -O-2 or ICD -O-3. NAACCR adopted ICD -O-2 as the standard coding system for tumors diagnosed beginning January 1, 1992. In addition, NAACCR recommended that tumors diagnosed prior to 1992 be converted to ICD -O-2. The topography (primary site) codes did not change between ICD -O-2 and ICD -O-3. Codes Valid ICD-O- 3 Codes. Resources for coding Primary Site for Solid Tumors The following is in priority order. 1. ICD-O o SEER Program Manual , including Coding Guidelines in Appendix C 2. Solid T umor Rules Coding Instructions for Solid Tumors Source: SEER Manual See the Coding Guidelines for Topography and Morphology in the introduction of the ICD -O-3 for additional details. Refer also to the current Solid Tumor Rules for selected primary site coding instructions. 1. Unless otherwise instructed, use all available information in the medical record to code the site. 2. Code the site in which the primary tumor originated, even if it extends onto/into an adjacent subsite. a. Primary site should always be coded to reflect the site of origin according to the medical opinion on the case. Look for information about where the neoplasm originated. Always code the primary site based on where the tumor arose / site of origin. b. Site of origin may be indicated by terms such as \"tumor arose from...,\" \"tumor originated in...,\" or similar statements . c. Site of origin is not necessarily the site of a biopsy . 135 d. Tumors may involve many sites. The primary site code should reflect the site where the tumor arose rather than all of the sites of involvement. i. Example 1: Final diagnosis is adenocarcinoma of the upper lobe of the right lung. Code the topography to lung, upper lobe (C341). ii. Example 2: The patient has a 4 cm tumor in the right breast. The tum or originated in the upper inner quadrant and extends into the lower inner quadrant. Code the primary site to upper inner quadrant of breast (C502). iii. Example 3: Patient has a right branchial cleft cyst; the pathology report identifies an adenocarcinoma ari sing in an ectopic focus of thyroid tissue within the branchial cleft cyst. Thyroidectomy pathology is negative. Code the primary site to branchial cleft (C104). iv. Example 4: The patient had a total hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy ten years ago for non- cancer reasons. She now has widespread cystadenocarcinoma in the peritoneum. Code the primary site to peritoneum, NOS (C482). (The chart may or may not state that the patient has extra- ovarian carcinoma.) v. Example 5: Pathology report shows adenocarcinoma arising in a patch of endometriosis on the sigmoid colon. Code the primary site to sigmoid colon (C187), the site in which the cancer originated. vi. Example 6: The patient has a left lower lip wedge excision showing invasive squamous cell carc inoma at the mucocutaneous junction. There is no further information in operative report or pathology report regarding the location of this tumor that would indicate this is a skin primary. Assign C001, external lower lip. C001 includes vermilion border of lower lip. Vermilion border is synonymous with mucocutaneous junction. 3. Do not adjust the primary site code to fit staging or any other data items 4. Code the last digit of the primary site code to '8' when a single tumor overlaps an adjacent subsite(s) of an organ, and the point of origin cannot be determined. a. Example: The patient has a primary tumor of the cervicothoracic esophagus, and the point of origin is unknown. Code the primary site to C158. b. Note: Skin cancers overlapping sites in the head and neck ONLY. Assign the primary site code for the site where the bulk of the tumor is or where the epicenter is; do not use code C448. 5. Code the site of the invasive tumor when there is an invasive tumor and also an in situ tumor in different subsites of the sam e anatomic site. a. Example 1: Patient has an invasive breast tumor in the upper -outer quadrant of the left breast and in situ tumor in multiple quadrants of the left breast. Code the primary site to C504 (u pper outer quadrant of breast). b. Example 2: Patient has in situ Paget disease of the right nipple and invasive duct carcinoma of the lower inner quadrant of the right breast. Code the primary site to C503 (lower inner quadrant). 6. Code the last digit of the primary site code to '9' for single primaries , when multiple tumors arise in different subsites of the same anatomic site and the point of origin cannot be determined . 136 a. Example 1: During a transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), the physician describes multiple papillary tumors in the bladder neck (C675) and the lateral wall of the bladder (C672). Code the primary site as bladder, NOS (C679). b. Example 2: Patient has an infiltrating duct tumor in the upper outer quadrant (C504) of the right breast and another infiltrating duct carcinoma in the lower inner (C503) quadrant of the right breast. Code the primary site as breast, NOS (C509). 7. Some histology/behavior terms in ICD -O-3.2 have a related site code in parentheses; for example, hepatoma (C220) . a. Code the site as documented in the medical record and ignore the suggested ICD -O-3.2 code when a primary site is specified in the medical record . i. Example: The path report says, \"infiltrating duct carcinoma of the head of pancreas.\" The listing in ICD -O-3.2 is infiltrating duct carcinoma 8500/3 (C50_). Code the primary site to head of pancreas (C250), NOT to breast (C50_) as suggested by the ICD -O-3.2. b. Use the site code suggested by ICD -O-3.2 when the primary site is the same as the site code suggested or the primary site is unknown. i. Example 1: The biopsy is positive for hepatoma, and no information is available about the primary site. Code the primary site to liver (C220) as suggested by ICD-O- 3.2. ii. Example 2: Excision of the right axillary nodes reveals metastatic infiltrating duct carcinoma. The right breast is negative. ICD -O-3.2 shows infiltrating duct carcinoma (8500) with a suggested site of breast (C50_). Code the primary site as breast, NOS (C509). c. Use the site code suggested by ICD -O-3.2 when there is no information available indicating a different primary site. i. Example: Biopsy of lymph node diagnosed as metastatic non- small cell carcinoma. Patient expired and there is no information available about the primary site. Assign C349 based on the site code suggested in ICD -O-3.2. 8. Code the primary site, not the metastatic site. If a tumor is metastatic and the primary site is unknown, code the primary site as unknown (C809). a. Code primary site using results of the molecular test CancerTYPE ID only when there is no other information about the primary site. Document in the text that the site is solely based on results from CancerTYPE ID molecular testing. Note : CancerTYPE ID tests are a standardized molecular method of determining primary site in tumors initially identified in a metastatic site. The use of CancerTYPE ID to determine primary site is not yet a standard practice and has not received FDA clearance. 9. See the site-specific Coding Guidelines in the SEER Manual , Appendix C for primary site Coding Guidelines for the following sites : a. Brain/CNS, Benign and Borderline b. Brain/CNS, malignant c. Intracranial Glands d. Pancreas 137 e. Bladder f. Breast g. Colon h. Esophagus i. Kaposi Sarcoma of All Sites j. Lung k. Rectosigmoid Junction 10. See section below for primary site Coding Guidelines for sarcoma 11. Angiosarcoma a. Code C422 (spleen) as the primary site for angiosarcoma of spleen . b. Code C50_ (breast) for angiosarcoma of breast. Although angiosarcoma actually originates in the lining of the blood vessels, an angiosarcoma originating in the breast has a poorer prognosis than many other breast tumors. 12. Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST): Code the primary site to the location where the GIST originated. 13. Transplants a. Code the primary site to the location of the transplanted organ when a malignancy arises in a transplanted organ, i.e., code the primary site to where the malignancy resides or lies . i. Example: There is a diagnosis of malignancy in transplanted section of colon serving as esophagus. Code the primary site as esophagus. Document the situation in a text field. b. For information about organ or tissue transplants, see the section Determining Multiple Primaries in the SEER Manual . c. For additional information about hematopoietic -related transplants, refer to the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database . 14. Assign primary site code C449, skin NOS, for a Merkel cell carcinoma presenting in a nodal or distant metastatic site and site of origin is unknown. 15. In the absence of any additional information about the primary site, assign the codes listed for these primary sites/histologies : Primary stomach C162 Angular incisura of stomach C163 Back of tongue Book -leaf lesion (mouth) C068 Clavicular skin C445 Prostatic sinus (urethra) C680 16. When the medical record does not contain enough information to assign a primary . a. Consult a physician advisor to assign the site code. b. Use the NOS category for the organ system or the Ill -Defined Sites (C760- C768) if the physician advisor cannot identify a primary site. i. Occult Tumors of the Head and Neck 1. Assign primary site C119 (nasopharynx) for occult head and neck tumors with cervical lymph node metastasis in Levels I -VII, and other group lymph nodes positive for Epstein- Barr virus (EBV+) (regardless of p16 status) encoded small RNAs (EBER) identified by in situ hybridization. 2. Assign primary site C109 (oropharynx) for occult head and neck tumors with cervical lymph node metastasis in Levels I -VII, and other group lymph nodes, p16 positive with histology consistent with HPV (OPC). 3. Assign C760 for Occult Head and Neck primaries with positive cervical lymph nodes. Schema Discriminator 1: Occult Head and Neck Lymph Nodes is used to discriminate between these cases and other uses of C760. 4. For more information about schemas and schema IDs, go to the SSDI Manual , Appendix A. c. Assign the NOS code for the body system when there are two or more possible primary sites documented and all are within the same system . i. Example: Two possible sites are documented in the GI system such as colon and small intestine; code to the GI tract, NOS (C269). Document the possible primary sites in a text field. d. Code unknown primary site when there is a physician statement of unknown primary site ONL Y when none of the above instructions can be applied. e. Code Unknown Primary Site (C809) if there is not enough information to assign an NOS or Ill-Defined Site category . Sarcoma Source: SEER Manual The majority of sarcomas arise in mesenchymal or connective tissues that are located in the musculoskeletal system, which includes the fat, muscles, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, nerves, bones, and cartilage. The default code for sarcomas of unknown primary site is C499 rather than C809. Sarcomas may also arise in the walls of hollow organs and in the viscera covering an organ. Code the primary site to the organ of origin. Example 1: The pathology identifies a carcinosarcoma of the uterine corpus. Code the primary site to corpus uteri (C549). 140 Example 2: Rhabdomyosarcoma of ethmoid si nus. Code primary site to C311. Code the organ of origin as the primary site when leiomyosarcoma arises in an organ. Do not code soft tissue as the primary site in this situation. Example 1: Leiomyosarcoma arises in kidney. Code the primary site to kidney (C649). Example 2: Leiomyosarcoma arises in prostate. Code primary site to prostate (C619).

Rationale This data item is required for prognostic stage grouping in AJCC 8th edition, Chapter 48, Breast. It was previously collected as Breast CS SSF # 2. Codes 0 PR negative (0.0% or less than 1%) 1 PR positive 7 Test ordered, results not in chart 9 Not documented in medical record Cannot be determined (indeterminate) PR (Progesterone Receptor) Summary status not assessed or unknown if assessed Coding Instructions Refer to the SSDI Manual for applicable schemas and coding instructions. 142 PSA (PROSTATIC SPECIFIC ANTIGEN) LAB VALUE Item # Length 3920 5 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: psaLabValue PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description PSA (Prostatic Specific Antigen) is a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland and is elevated in patients with prostate cancer. This data item pertains to PSA lab value. Serum PSA is the most sensitive tumor marker for monitoring individuals with prostate cancer, including progression of disease and response to therapy. Although originally not intended to be a screening test, this relatively simple blood test has become a very common method of detecting new prostate cancer in its earliest stages. PSA can be totally negative when prostate cancer is found on digital rectal exam. In such cases, PSA will not be helpful in monitoring for recurrence. Note: Serum PSA is not the s ame as free PSA or precursor PSA \u2014do not record values from either of these tests in this field. Rationale This data item is required for prognostic stage grouping in AJCC 8th edition, Chapter 58, Prostate. It was previously collected as Prostate, CS SSF# 1. Codes Each Site -Specific Data Item (SSDI) applies only to selected primary sites, histologies, and years of diagnosis. Depending on applicability and standard- setter requirements, SSDIs may be left blank. 0.1 0.1 or less nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml) (Exact value to nearest tenth of ng/ml) 0.2-999.9 0.2-999.9 ng/ml (Exact value to nearest tenth of ng/ml) XXX.1 1,000 ng/ml or greater XXX.2 Lab value not available, physician states PSA is negative/normal XXX.3 Lab value not available, physician states PSA is positive/elevated/high XXX.7 Test ordered, results not in chart XXX.9 Not documented in medical record PSA lab value not assessed or unknown if assessed Coding Instructions Refer to the SSDI Manual for applicable schemas and coding instructions. 143 RACE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Item # Length 160, 161, 162, 163, 164 2 Alternate Name: Race 1...Race5 XML NAACCR ID: race1...race5 PARENT XML ELEMENT: Patient Description Race and ethnicity are defined by specific physical, hereditary and cultural traditions or origins, not necessarily by birthplace, place of residence, or citizenship. 'Origin' is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or in some cases, the country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. The five race data items make it possible to code multiple races for one person, cons istent with the 2000 Census. All resources in the facility, including the medical record, face sheet, physician and nursing notes, photographs, and any other sources, must be used to determine race. If a facility does not print race in the medical record but does maintain it in electronic form, the electronic data must also be reviewed. Recommendation: Document how the race code(s) was (were) determined in a text field. Codes 01 White 02 Black or African American 03 American Indian or Alaska Native 04 Chinese 05 Japanese 06 Filipino 07 Native Hawaiian 08 Korean 10 Vietnamese 11 Laotian 12 Hmong 13 Cambodian 14 Thai 144 15 Asian Indian, NOS or Pakistani, NOS 16 Asian Indian (Effective with 01/01/2010 dx) 17 Pakistani (Effective with 01/01/2010 dx) 20 Micronesian, NOS 21 Chamorro 22 Guamanian, NOS 25 Polynesian, NOS 26 Tahitian 27 Samoan 28 Tongan 30 Melanesian, NOS 31 Fiji Islander 32 Papua New Guinean 88 No additional races (Race 2 - Race 5) 96 Other Asian, including Asian, NOS 97 Pacific Islander, NOS 98 Some other race 99 Unknown by patient Priorities for Coding Multiple Races Source: SEER Manual 1. Code 07 takes priority over all other codes . a. Example: Patient is described as Japanese and Hawaiian. Code Race 1 as 07 ( Native Hawaiian), Race 2 as 05 (Japanese). 2. Codes 02-32, 96 -98 take priority over code 01 . 3. Code only the specific race when both a specific race code and a non- specific race code apply . 4. Codes 04- 17 take priority over code 96. 5. Codes 16- 17 take priority over code 15. 6. Codes 20- 32 take priority over code 97. 7. Codes 02- 32 and 96 -97 take priority over code 98 . 8. Code 98 takes priority over code 99. 145 Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Do not use patient name as the basis for coding race a. See Coding Instruction 15, Exception, for the only situation in which name is taken into account when coding race 2. Code race using the highest priority source available according to the list below (a is the highest and c is the lowest) when race is reported differently by two or more sources. Use self - reported information as first priority. a. Self-reported race information takes precedence over genetic testing and over information obtained through linkages. Generally, race information is used from linkages when race data are missing or unknown, or to enhance data. Self -reported information is the highest priority for coding race because the race information for the U.S. population comes from census data and that information is self -reported. For national cancer statistics, in order for the numerator (cancer cases) and the denominator (population) to be comparable, use self -reported race information whenever it is available. Sources in Priority Order a. The patient' s self -declared identification b. Documentation in the medical record c. Death certificate 3. Assign the same race code(s) for all tumors for one patient 4. Code the race(s) of the patient in data items Race 1, Race 2, Race 3, Race 4, and Race 5 a. Code 88 for the remaining race data items ( Race 2 - Race 5) when at least one race, but fewer than five races, are reported 5. Use the associated text field to document a. Why a particular race code was chosen when there are discrepancies in race information i. Example: The pati ent is identified as Black in nursing notes and White in a dictated physical exam. Use a text field to document why one race was coded rather than the other. b. That no race information is available 6. Code White (01) when a. The race is described as White or Caucasian regardless of place of birth b. There is a statement that the patient is Hispanic or Latino(a) and no further information is available i. A person of Spanish origin may be any race; however, for coding race when there is no further information other than \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino(a),\" assign race as White as a last resort instead of coding unknown. c. Example: Sabrina Fitzsimmons is a Latina. No further information is available. Code race as 01 (White). 146 i. Note 1 : Do not code 98 (Other) in this situation. ii. Note 2 : Persons of Spanish or Hispanic origin may be of any race, although persons of Mexican, Central American, South American, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin are usually White. 7. Code race as 02 (Black or African American) when the stated race is African- American, Black, or Negro 8. Assign code 03 for any person stated to be a. Native Alaskan (western hemisphere) OR b. American Indian, whether from North, Central, South, or Latin America 9. Assign a specific code when a specific Asian race is stated. Do not use code 96 when a specific race is known. a. Example: Patient is described as Asian in a consult note and as second generation Korean- American in the history. Code Race 1 as 08 (Korean) and Race 2 through Race 5 as 88. b. Note: Do not code 96 (Other Asian including Asian, NOS) in a subsequent race data item when a specific Asian race has been coded. 10. Code the race based on birthplace information when the race is recorded as Oriental, Mongolian, or Asian and the place of birth is recorded as China, Japan, the Philippines, or another Asian nation a. Example 1: Race is recorded as Asian and the place of birth is recorded as Japan. Code race as 05 (Japanese) because it is more specific than 96. b. Example 2: The person describes himself as an Asian- American born in Laos. Code race as 11 (Laotian) because it is more specific than 96. 11. Use the appropriate non- specific code 96 (Other Asian including Asian, NOS), 97 (Pacific Islander, NOS), or 98 (Some other race) when there is no race code for a specific race a. Note : Document the specified race in a text field. 12. Do not use code 96, 97, or 98 for \"multi -racial.\" See Coding Examples below. 13. All race data items must be coded 99 (Unknown by patient) when Race 1 is code d 99 (Unknown by patient) a. Note : Assign code 99 in Race 2 -Race 5 only when Race 1 is coded 99. 14. Assign code 99 for death certificate only (DCO) cases when race is unknown 15. Refer to Appendix D \"Race and Nationality Descriptions\" in the SEER Manual when race is unknown or not stated in the medical record and birthplace is recorded a. In some cases, race may be inferred from the nationality. Use Appendix D to identify nationalities from which race codes may be inferred. b. Example 1: Record states: \"this native of Portugal...\" Code race as 01 (White) per the Appendix. c. Example 2: Record states: \"this patient was Nigerian...\" Code race as 02 (Black or African American) per the Appendix. 147 d. Exception: Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 (Unknown by patient) when patient's name is incongruous with the race inferred on the basis of nationality. Do not code the inferred race when the patient's name is incongruent with the race inferred on the basis of nationality. i. Example 1: Patient's name is Siddhartha Rao and birthplace is listed as England. Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 (Unknown). ii. Example 2: Patient's name is Ping Chen and birthplace is Ethiopia. Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 (Unknown). 16. When the patient face- sheet indicates \"Race Other,\" look for other descriptions of the patient's race. When no further race information is available , code race as 99 (Unknown by patient) and document that patient face- sheet indicates \"Race Other,\" and no further race information is available. 17. Patient photographs may be used with caution to determine race in the absence of any other information a. Use caution when interpreting a patient photograph to assist in determining race. Review the patient record for a statement to verify race. The use of photographs alone to determine race may lead to misclassification of race. 18. Code the race data items in the order stated when no other priority applies 19. The race of parents, when known, may be used with caution to determine patient's race in the absence of other more specific information (see coding examples 5 and 7) Coding Examples Example 1: Patient is stated to be Ja panese. Code as 05 (Japanese). Example 2: Patient is stated to be German- Irish. Code as 01 (White). Example 3: Patient is described as Arabian. Code as 01 (White). Example 4: Patient described as a black female. Code as 02 (Black or African American). Example 5: Patient states she has a Polynesian mother and Tahitian father. Code Race 1 as 25 (Polynesian), Race 2 as 26 (Tahitian) and Race 3 through Race 5 as 88. Example 6: Patient describes herself as multi -racial (nothing more specific) and nursing no tes say \"African -American.\" Code Race 1 as 02 (Black or African American) and Race 2 through Race 5 as 88. Example 7: The patient is described as Asian- American with Korean parents. Code race as 08 (Korean) because it is more specific than 96 (Asian) [ -American]. Example 8: Race 1 through Race 5 in the cancer record are coded as 99 (Unknown by patient). The death certificate states race as black. Change cancer record for Race 1 to 02 (Black or African American) and Race 2 through Race 5 to 88. Example 9: Race 1 is coded in the cancer record as 96 (Asian). Death certificate gives birthplace as China. Change Race 1 in the cancer record to 04 (Chinese) and code Race 2 through Race 5 as 88. Example 10: Patient is stated to be Chinese and black. Code Race 1 as 04 (Chinese), code Race 2 as 02 (Black or African American). Code in the order stated when no other priority applies. Example 11: Patient described as Middle Eastern. Code as 01 (White). Example 12: Patient described as Greek. Code as 01 (White). 148 Example 13: Race 1 is coded by one facility as 02 (Black or African American) and Race 1 is coded by a different facility as 03 (American Indian or Alaska Native); no further documentation is provided. When consolidating records at the central cancer registry, code Race 1 as 98 (Some other race). If the patient is identified as Native American via the IHS linkage, follow usual procedures. Example 14: Patient is from Guyana. Patient's race is coded differently in multiple source records using codes such as 02 (Black or African American) for Race 1 or 98 (Some other race) or 15 (Asian Indian, NOS or Pakistani, NOS) for example; no further documentation is provided. When consolidating records at the central ca ncer registry, code Race 1 as 98 (Some other race). 149 REASON FOR NO RADIATION Item # Length 1430 1 Alternate Name: Reason for No Regional Radiation Therapy XML NAACCR ID: reasonForNoRadiation PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Code the reason the patient did not receive radiation treatment as part of first course of therapy. IMPORTANT: Make sure to justify the code you enter in this field by completing the associated RADIATION text field Codes 0 Radiation therapy was administered. 1 Radiation therapy was not administered because it was not part of the planned first - course treatment. Diagnosed at autopsy. 2 Radiation therapy was not administered because it was contraindicated due to patient risk factors (comorbid conditions, advanced age, etc.). 5 Radiation therapy was not administered because the patient died prior to planned or recommended treatment. 6 Radiation therapy was not administered; it was recommended by the patient's physician but was not administered as part of the first -course therapy. No reason was noted in the patient's record. 7 Radiation therapy was not administered; it was recommended by the patient's physician, but this treatment was refused by the patient, the patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 8 Radiation therapy was recommended, but it is unknown if it was administered. 9 It is unknown if radiation therapy was recommended or administered. DCO Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Assign code 0 if the patient received regional radiation as part of first course of therapy . 2. Assign code 1 if the treatment plan offered multiple alternative treatment options but the patient selected treatment that did not include radiation therapy . 3. Assign code 7 if the patient refused recommended radiation therapy, made a blanket refusal of 150 all recommended treatment, or refused all treatment before any was recommended. 4. Assign code 8: a. If it is known that a physician recommended radiation treatment, but no further documentation is available to confirm it was given. b. To indicate referral to a radiation oncologist was made and the registry should follow to determine whether radiation was administered . c. If follow -up to the specialist or facility determines the patient was never there and no other documentation can be found, assign Code 1. d. Note: Cases coded 8 should be followed and updated to a more definitive code as appropriate. 5. Assign code 9: a. If the treatment plan offered multiple alternative treatment options, but it is unknown which treatment, if any, was provided. b. If a DC O case . 151 REASON FOR NO SURGERY Item # Length 1340 1 Alternate Name: Reason for No Cancer -Directed Surgery (SEER) Reason for No CA Dir Surgery (CoC) Reason for No Surgery to Primary Site XML NAACCR ID: reasonForNoSurgery PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Records the reason that no surgery was performed on the primary site. IMPORTANT: Justify the code you enter in this field by completing the associated text field: RX TEXT SURGERY Rationale This data item provides information related to the quality of care and describes why primary site surgery was not performed. Codes 0 Surgery of the primary site was performed. 1 Surgery of the primary site was not performed because it was not part of the planned first-course treatment. 2 Surgery of the primary site was not recommended/performed because it was contraindicated due to patient risk factors (comorbid conditions, advanced age, etc.). 5 Surgery of the primary site was not performed because the patient died prior to planned or recommended surgery. 6 Surgery of the primary site was not performed; it was recommended by the patient's phys ician but was not performed as part of the first -course therapy. No reason was noted in the patient's record. 7 Surgery of the primary site was not performed; it was recommended by the patient's physician, but this treatment was refused by the patient, the patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 8 Surgery of the primary site was recommended, but it is unknown if it was performed. Further follow -up is recommended. 9 It is unknown if surgery of the primary site was recommended or performed. Death certificate -only cases and autopsy -only cases. 152 Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Assign code 0 when Surgery of Primary Site is coded in the range of A100- A900 or B100- B900 (surgery of the primary site was performed) . 2. Assign code 1 when Surgery of Primary Site is coded A980 or B000 (not applicable) . For autopsy only cases, see instruction 4. 3. Assign a code in the range of 1 -8 when Surgery of Primary Site is coded A000 or B000. Note: Referral to a surgeon is equivalent to a recommendation for surgery. a. Assign code 1 when : i. Primary site is C420, C421, C423, C424, C760- C768, or C809 Note: Surgery is not standard treatment for these cases. ii. There is no information in the patient's medical record about surgery, AND It is known that surgery is not usually performed for this type and/or stage of cancer OR There is no reason to suspect that the patient would have had surgery of primary site . a. Example: The patient would not be a surgical candidate because of advanced stage. iii. The treatment plan offered multiple treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include surgery of the primary site. Example: Prostate cancer patient is offered three treatment options: a. Radical prostatectomy, b. Radiation therapy, or c. Hormone therapy. The patient chose to have radiation therapy. Assign code 1. Surgery of the primary site was not performed because it was not part of the planned first course of treatment. The treatment plan was for the patient to receive ONE of three treatment modality options: surgery, OR radiation, OR hormone therapy. At no time did the physician recommend that the patient have surgery AND radiation therapy AND hormone therapy. The patient chose radiation. This does not mean he refused surgery because at no time did the treatment plan include both radiation AND surgery. Recording that a patient refused the treatment modality means that the patient refused recommended therapy. This is a quality control check explaining why the patient did not receive the expected treatment for their cancer (patient's choice versus physician's choice, or facility's lack of providing quality care). iv. Surgery was part of the first course of treatment but was cancelled due to complete response to radiation and/or systemic therapy . v. Patient elected to pursue no treatment followi ng the discussion of surgery. Discussion does not equal a recommendation. Patient's decision not to pursue surgery is not a refusal of surgery in this situation. vi. Active surveillance/watchful waiting is the first course (e.g., prostate) . b. Assign code 6 when 153 i. It is KNOWN that surgery was recommended AND ii. It is KNOWN that surgery was not performed AND iii. There is no documentation explaining why surgery was not done. Example: The medical record has a recommendation that the patient have surgery. No further admissions or documentation of surgery found; the primary care physician replies that the patient did NOT have surgery. No further information is given; it is unknown if the patient refused surgery or if there were co -morbid conditions that prevented the surgical procedure. c. Assign code 7 when the patient i. Refuses recommended surgery OR ii. Makes a blanket statement that he/she refused all treatment when surgery is a customary option according to NCCN guidelines and/or the NCI PDQ for the primary site/histology Assign code 1 when surgery is not normally performed for the site/histology iii. Note : Coding Reason for No Surgery of Primary Site as \"refused\" does not affect the coding of the other treatment data items (e.g., Radiation, Chemotherapy, Hormone Therapy, etc.). Code 7 means surgery is exactly what was recommended by the physician and the patient refused. If two treatment alternatives were offered and surgery was not chosen, code Reason no surgery of primary site as 1 [Surgery of the primary site was not performed because it was not part of the planned first -course treatment]. d. Assign code 8 when surgery is recommended, but it is unknown if the patient actually had the surgery . Example: There is documentation in the medical record that the primary care physician referred the patient to a surgical oncologist. Follow -back to the surgical oncolo gist and primary care physician yields no further information. Assign code 8, it is known that surgery was recommended but there is no information on whether or not the patient actually had the surgical procedure. Note: Review cases coded 8 periodically f or later confirmation of surgery. 4. Assign code 9: a. When there is no documentation that surgery was recommended or performed. b. For death certificate only (DCO) cases . c. Autopsy only cases . 154 RECORD TYPE Item # Length 10 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: recordType PARENT XML ELEMENT: NaaccrData Description Generated field that identifies which of the six NAACCR data exchange record types is being used in a file of data exchange records.

IMPORTANT: Include text justification for the code entered in this field in at least one of the appropriate text fields: TEXT - STAGING, TEXT - DX PROC - X-RAY/SCAN and/or TEXT - DX PROC -- PATHOLOGY Rationale This data item serves as a quality measure of the pathologic and surgical evaluation and treatment of the patient. Codes 00 No nodes were examined 01-89 1-89 nodes were examined (code the exact number of regional lymph nodes examined) 90 90 or more nodes were examined 95 No regional nodes were removed, but aspiration of regional nodes was performed 96 Regional lymph node removal was documented as a sampling, and the number of nodes is unknown/ not stated 97 Regional lymph node removal was documented as a dissection, and the number of nodes is unknown/not stated 98 Regional lymph nodes were surgically removed, but the number of lymph nodes is unknown/not stated and not documented as a sampling or dissection; nodes were examined, but the number is unknown 99 It is unknown whether nodes were examined; not stated in patient record 156 Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Regional lymph nodes only . Record information only about regional lymph nodes in this data item. a. Include lymph nodes that are regional in the current AJCC Staging Manual . 2. This data item is based on pathologic information only, including autopsy. This data item is to be recorded regardless of whether the patient received neoadjuvant (preoperative) treatment. Information from the autopsy may be used to code Regional Nodes Examined. Use text fields to explain the situation. 3. Use code 00 when: a. The assessment of lymph nodes is clinical . b. No lymph nodes are removed and examined. c. A \"dissection\" of a lymph node drainage area is found to contain no lymph nodes at the time of pathologic examinat ion. d. Note: When Regional Nodes Examined is coded 00, Regional Nodes Positive is coded 98. 4. Nodes removed and examined is cumulative. Record the total number of regional lymph nodes removed and examined by the pathologist. Record lymph nodes removed during an autopsy for autopsy -only cases. a. The number of regional lymph nodes examined is cumulative from all procedures that removed lymph nodes through the completion of surgeries in the first course of treatment . b. Do not count an aspiration or core biopsy of a lymph node in the same lymph node chain removed at surgery as an additional node in Regional Nodes Examined . i. Example: Lung cancer patient has a mediastinoscopy and positive core biopsy of a hilar lymph node. Patient then undergoes right upper lobectomy that yields 3 hilar and 2 mediastinal nodes positive out of 11 nodes dissected. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 05 and Regional Nodes Examined as 11 because the core biopsy was of a lymph node in the same chain as the nodes dissected. c. Include the node in the count of Regional Nodes Examined when the aspiration or core biopsy is from a node in a different node region. i. Example: Breast cancer patient has a positive core biopsy of a supraclavicular node and an axillary dissection showing 3 of 8 nodes positive. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 04 and Regional Nodes Examined as 09 because the supraclavicular lymph node is in a different, but still regional, lymph node chain. d. Assume the lymph node that is aspirated or core- biopsied is part of the lymph node chain surgically removed and do not include it in the count of Regional Nodes Examined when its location is not known. i. Example: Patient record states that lymph node core biopsy was performed at another facility and 7/14 regional lymph nodes were positive at t he time of resection. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 07 and Regional Nodes Examined as 14. 157 5. Priority of lymph node counts. Use information in the following priority when there is a discrepancy regarding the number of lymph nodes examined: a. Final diagnosis . b. Synoptic report (also known as CAP protocol or pathology report checklist; the consolidated findings on the CAP protocol) . c. Microscopic description . d. Gross description . 6. Code 95. Use code 95 when the only procedure for regional lymph nodes is a needle aspiration (cytology) or core biopsy (tissue). a. Example: Patient with esophageal cancer. Enlarged mid- esophageal node found on CT scan, which is aspirated and found to be positive. Patient undergoes radiation therapy and no surgery. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 95 and Regional Nodes Examined as 95. 7. Lymph no de excision biopsy. If a lymph node excision biopsy was performed, code the number of nodes removed, if known. 8. Definition of \"sampling\" (code 96). A lymph node \"sampling\" is removal of a limited number of lymph nodes. Other terms for removal of a limited number of nodes include lymph node biopsy, berry picking, sentinel lymph node procedure, sentinel node biopsy and selective dissection. Use code 96 when a limited number of nodes are removed but the number is unknown. 9. Definition of \"dissection\" (code 97). A lymph node \"dissection\" is removal of most or all of the nodes in the lymph node chain(s) that drain the area around the primary tumor. Other terms include lymphadenectomy, radical node dissection, and lymph node stripping. Removal of lymph nodes during autopsy is a dissection. Use code 97 when more than a limited number of lymph nodes are removed, and the number is unknown. 10. Multiple lymph node procedures. Use code 97 when both a lymph node sampling and a lymph node dissection are performed, and the tot al number of lymph nodes examined is unknown. 11. Use code 98 when neither the type of lymph node removal procedure nor the number of lymph nodes examined is known 12. Use code 99 for : a. Any case coded to primary HemeRetic 00830 f. Ill-defined/Other 99999 g. Cases with no information about the examination of regional lymph nodes For more information about schemas and schema IDs, go to the SSDI Manual , Appendix A. 158 REGIONAL NODES POSITIVE Item # Length 820 2 Alternate Name: Pathologic Review of Regional Lymph Nodes (SEER) Regional Lymph Nodes Positive Number of Positive Regional Lymph Nodes (SEER) XML NAACCR ID: regionalNodesPositive PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Records the exact number of regional nodes examined by the pathologist and found to contain metastases. Beginning with tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2004, this item is a component of the Collaborative Stage system. For tumors diagnosed from 1988 through 2003, this item was part of the 10 -digit EOD [779], detailed site -specific codes for anatomic EOD. IMPORTANT: Include text justification for the code entered in this field in at least one of the appropriate text fields: TEXT - STAGING, TEXT - DX PROC - X-RAY/SCAN and/or TEXT - DX PROC -- PATHOLOGY Rationale This data item is necessary for pathologic staging, and it serves as a quality measure for pathology reports and the extent of the surgical evaluation and treatment of the patient. Codes 00 All nodes examined are negative 01-89 1-89 nodes are positive (code exact number of nodes positive) 90 90 or more nodes are positive 95 Positive aspiration of lymph node(s) was performed 97 Positive nodes are documented, but the number is unspecified 98 No nodes were examined 99 It is unknown whether nodes are positive; not applicable; not stated in patient record 00 All nodes examined are negative Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Regional lymph nodes only. Record information only about regional lymph nodes in this data item. 159 a. Include lymph nodes that are regional in the current AJCC Staging Manual 2. This data item is based on pathological information only , including autopsy . This data item is to be recorded regardless of whether the patient received neoadjuvant (preoperative) treatment. Information from the autopsy may be used to code Regional Nodes Positive. Use text fields to explain the situation. 3. True in situ cases cannot have positive lymph nodes, so the only allowable codes are 00 (negative) or 98 (not examined). Codes 01- 97 and 99 are not allowed. 4. Nodes positive is cumulative. Record the total number of regional lymph nodes removed and found to be positive by pathologic examination. Record lymph nodes re moved and found to be positive during an autopsy for autopsy -only cases. a. The number of regional nodes positive is cumulative from all procedures that remove lymph nodes through the completion of surgeries in the first course of treatment . b. Do not count a positive aspiration or core biopsy of a lymph node in the same lymph node chain removed at surgery as an additional node in Regional Nodes Positive when there are positive nodes in the resection. In other words, when there are positive regional lym ph nodes in a lymph node dissection, do not count the core needle biopsy or the fine needle aspiration if it is in the same chain. See also Use of Code 95 below. i. Example 1: Lung cancer patient has a mediastinoscopy and positive core biopsy of a hilar lymp h node. Patient then undergoes right upper lobectomy that yields 3 hilar and 2 mediastinal nodes positive out of 11 nodes dissected. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 05 and Regional Nodes Examined as 11 because the core biopsy was of a lymph node in the sam e chain as the nodes dissected. ii. Example 2: Positive right cervical lymph node aspiration followed by right cervical lymph node dissection showing 1 of 6 nodes positive. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 01 and Regional Nodes Examined as 06. c. Include the node in the count of Regional Nodes Positive when the positive aspiration or core biopsy is from a node in a different node region. i. Example: Breast cancer patient has a positive core biopsy of a supraclavicular node and an axillary dissection showing 3 of 8 nodes positive. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 04 and Regional Nodes Examined as 09 because the supraclavicular lymph node is in a different, but still regional, lymph node chain. d. Assume the lymph node that is core- biopsied or aspirated is part of the ly mph node chain surgically removed and do not include it in the count of Regional Nodes Positive when its location is not known. i. Example: Patient record states that lymph node core biopsy was performed at another facility and 7/14 regional lymph nodes were positive at the time of resection. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 07 and Regional Nodes Examined as 14. 5. Priority of lymph node counts. Use information in the following priority when there is a discrepancy regarding the number of positive lymph nodes . a. Final diagnosis . b. Synoptic report (also known as CAP protocol or pathology report checklist; the consolidated findings on the CAP protocol) . 160 c. Microscopic description . d. Gross description . 6. Positive nodes in multiple primaries in same organ. a. Determine the hi stology of the metastases in the nodes and code the nodes as positive for the primary with that histology when there are multiple primary cancers with different histologic types in the same organ and the pathology report just states the number of nodes pos itive. b. Code the nodes as positive for all primaries when no further information is available. c. Example: A breast case is two separate primaries as determined by the SEER multiple primary rules. The pathology report states \"3 of 11 lymph nodes positive for metastasis\" with no further information available. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 03 and Regional Nodes Examined as 11 for both primaries. 7. Isolated Tumor Cells (ITCs) in lymph nodes . a. For all cases except cutaneous melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma of skin : i. Count only lymph nodes that contain micrometastases or larger (metastases greater than 0.2 millimeters in size) ii. Assume the metastases are larger than 0.2 mm and count the lymph node(s) as positive when the path report indicates that no des are positive, but the size of metastasis is not stated iii. Do not include in the count of lymph nodes positive any nodes that are identified as containing ITCs b. For cutaneous melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma of skin: i. Count nodes with ITCs as positive l ymph nodes 8. Use code 95 when : a. The only procedure for regional lymph nodes is a needle aspiration (cytology) or core biopsy (tissue) . b. A positive lymph node is aspirated and there are no surgically resected lymph nodes . i. Example: Patient with esophageal ca ncer. Enlarged mid- esophageal node found on CT scan, which is aspirated and found to be positive. Patient undergoes radiation therapy and no surgery. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 95 and Regional Nodes Examined as 95. c. A positive lymph node is aspirated, and surgically resected lymph nodes are negative. i. Example: Lung cancer patient has aspiration of suspicious hilar mass that shows metastatic squamous carcinoma in lymph node tissue. Patient undergoes neoadjuvant (preoperative) radiation therapy followed by lobectomy showing 6 negative hilar lymph nodes. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 95 and Regional Nodes Examined as the 06 nodes surgically resected. 9. Code 97. Use code 97 for any combination of positive aspirated, biops ied, sampled, or dissected lymph nodes when the number of involved nodes cannot be determined on the basis of cytology or histology. Code 97 includes positive lymph nodes diagnosed by either cytology or histology. 161 a. Example: Patient with carcinoma of the py riform sinus has a mass in the mid neck. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of one node is positive. The patient has neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy, then resection of the primary tumor and a radical neck dissection. In the radical neck dissection, \"several\" of 10 nodes are positive; the remainder of the nodes show chemotherapy effect. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 97 because the total number of positive nodes biopsied and removed is unknown, and code Regional Nodes Examined as 10. b. Note: If the aspirated node is the only one that is microscopically positive, use code 95. 10. Use code 98 when : a. The assessment of lymph nodes is clinical only . b. No lymph nodes are removed and examined. c. A \"dissection\" of a lymph node drainage area is found to contain no lymph nodes at the time of pathologic examination. d. Regional Nodes Positive is coded 98, Regional Nodes Examined is usually coded 00 . 11. Use code 99 for: a. Any case coded HemeRetic 00830 f. Ill-defined/Other 99999 g.

Immunotherapy consists of biological or chemical agents that alter the immune system or change the host's response to tumor cells. Records immunotherapeutic (biological therapy, biotherapy, or biological response modifier (BRM)) agents administered as first course of therapy. See SEER*Rx for immunoth erapy drug codes. Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system, either directly or indirectly, to fight cancer or to reduce the side effects that may be caused by some cancer treatments. Record only those treatments that are administered to affect the canc er cells . IMPORTANT: Justify the code you enter in this field by completing the associated text field: RX TEXT -- BRM Rationale Systemic therap y may involve the administration of one or a combination of agents. This data item allows for the evaluation of the administration of immunotherapeutic agents as part of the first course of therapy. Note: Prior to 2013, targeted therapies that invoke an immune response, such as Herceptin, had been coded as chemotherapy. Effective with cases diagnosed January 1, 2013, and forward these therapies are classified as biological response modifiers. Coding instructions for these changes have been added to the remarks field for the applicable drugs in the SEER*Rx Interactive Drug Database. Codes Refer to the most recent version of the STORE Manual and SEER Manual for additional instructions. 00 None, immunotherapy was not part of the planned first course of therapy 01 Immunotherapy was administered as first course therapy 82 Immunotherapy was not recommended/administered because it was contraindicated due to patient risk factors (comorbid conditions, advanced age, etc.) 85 Immunotherapy was not administered because the patient died prior to planned or recommended therapy 172 86 Immunotherapy was not administered; it was recommended by the patient's physician but was not administered as part of the first -course of therapy. No reason was noted in the patient's record. 87 Immunotherapy was not administered. It was recommended by the patient's physician, but this treatment was refused by the patient, a patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 88 Immunotherapy was recommended, but it is unknown if it was administered 99 It is unknown if immunotherapy was recommended or administered because it is not stated in patient record Definitions Immunotherapy is designed to : 1. Make cancer cells more recognizable and therefore more susceptible to destruction by the immune system . 2. Boost the killing power of immune system cells, such as T -cells, NK -cells, and macrophages . 3. Alter the growth patterns of cancer cells to promote behavior like that of healthy cells . 4. Block or reverse the process that changes a normal cell or a pre- cancerous cell into a cancerous cell . 5. Enhance the body's ability to repair or replace normal cells damaged or destroyed by other forms of cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation . 6. Prevent cancer cells from spreading to other parts of the body . Types of Immunotherapy Cancer Treatment Vaccines: Also called therapeutic vaccines, are a type of immunotherapy. The vaccines work to boost the body's natural defenses to fight a cancer. Doctors give treatment vaccines to people already diagnosed with cancer. The vaccines may: Prevent cancer from returning Destroy any cancer cells still in the body after other treatment Stop a tumor from growing or spreading Please refer to SEER*Rx to determine how to code non-FDA approved vaccines. Interferons: Interferons belong to a group of proteins called cytokines. They are produced naturally by the white blood cells in the body. Interferon- alpha is able to slow tumor growth directly as well as activate the immune system. It is used for a number of cancers including multiple myeloma, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hairy cell leukemia, and malignant melanoma. Interleukins (IL-2) are often used to treat kidney cancer and melanoma. Monoclonal Antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies (Mab) are produced in a laboratory. The artificial antibodies are used in a variety of ways in systemic therapy and can be chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or ancillary drugs. Some are injected into the patient to seek out and disrupt cancer cell activities. When the monoclonal antibody disrupts tumor growth, it is coded as chemotherapy. Other Mabs are linked to radioisotopes (conjugated monoclonal antibodies). The Mab finds and attaches to the target tumor cells and brings with it the radioisotope that actually kills the tumor cell. The monoclonal antibody itself does nothing to enhance the immune system. Conjugated monoclonal 173 antibodies such as tositumomab (Bexxar) or ibritumomab (Zevalin) are coded to the part of the drug that actually kills the cells, usually radioisotopes. A third function of Mab is to enhance the immune response against the cancer, either by identifying tumor cells that are mimicking normal cells, or by boosting the body's natural defenses that destroy foreign cells. Consult SEER*Rx for the treatment category in which each monoclonal antibody should be coded. Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Assign code 00 when : a. The medical record states that immunotherapy was not given, not recommended, or not indicated. b. There is no information in the patient's medical record about immunot herapy AND i.

It was recommended by the patient 's physician, but the treatment was refused by the patient, a patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 88 Chemotherapy was recommended, but it is unknown if it was administered 99 It is unknown whether a chemotherapeutic agent(s) was recommended or administered because it is not stated in the patient record Definitions Chemotherapy recommended: A consult recommended chemotherapy, or the attending physician documented that chemotherapy was recommended. A referral to a clinical oncologist is equivalent to a recommendation. Multiple agent chemotherapy: Planned first course of therapy included two or more chemotherapeutic agents and those agents were administered. The planned first course of therapy may or may not have included other agents such as hormone therapy, immunotherapy, or other treatment in addition to the chemotherapeutic agents. Single agent chemotherapy: Only one chemotherapeutic agent was administered to destroy cancer tissue during the first course of therapy. The chemotherapeutic agent may or may not have been administered with other drugs classified as immunotherapy, hormone therapy , ancillary, or other treatment. Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Code the chemotherapeutic agents whose actions are chemotherapeutic only; do not code the method of administration. 2. When chemotherapeutic agents are used as radiosensitizers or radioprotectants, they are given at a much lower dosage and do not affect the cancer. Radiosensitizers and radioprotectants are classified as ancillary drugs. See SEER*Rx . Do not code as chemotherapy. Review the radiation- oncology progress notes for information about radiosensitizing chemotherapy. a. Note: Do not assume that a chemo agent given with radiation therapy is a radiosensitizer. Seek additional information. Compare the dose given to the dose normally given for treatment. b. For additional information, see: i. The National Cancer Institute Physician Data Query (PDQ), Health Professional Version AND/OR ii. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology 3. The physician may change a drug during the first course of therapy because the patient cannot tolerate the original agent . a. This is a continuation of the first course of therapy when the chemotherapeutic agent that is substituted belongs to the same grou p (alkylating, antimetabolites, natural products, targeted therapy, or other miscellaneous) . 176 b. Do not code the new agent as first course therapy when the original chemotherapeutic agent is changed to one that is NOT in the same group. Code only the original agent as first course. When the new agent is in a different group, it is second course therapy. c. Use SEER*Rx and compare the subcategory of each chemotherapy agent to determine whether or not they belong to the same group (subcategory). See \"Chemotherapeutic Agents\" below for the groups and their definitions. 4. Code as treatment for both primaries when the patient receives chemotherapy for invasive carcinoma in one breast and also has an invasive or in situ carcinoma in the other breast. Chemotherapy would likely affect both primaries. a. Example: Patient is diagnosed with infiltrating duct carcinoma, stage III, in the right breast and infiltrating duct carcinoma, stage I, in the left breast. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered for the stage III neoplasm in the right breast per the breast surgeon consult, but not for the left breast. Code the chemotherapy on bot h abstracts for both primaries in this case (simultaneous bilateral breast primaries). 5. Assign code 00 when : a. The medical record documents chemotherapy was not given, was not recommended, or was not indicated. b. There is no information in the patient's medical record about chemotherapy, AND i. It is known that chemotherapy is not usually performed for this type and/or stage of cancer OR ii. There is no reason to suspect that the patient would have had chemotherapy . c. The treatment plan offered multiple treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include chemotherapy . d. Patient elects to pursue no treatment following the discussion of chemotherapy. Discussion does not equal a recommendation. Patient's decision not to pursue chemotherapy is not a refusal of chemotherapy in this situation. e. Active surveillance/watchful waiting is the first course of treatment (e.g., CLL) . f. Patient diagnosed at autopsy . g. Example: Patient is diagnosed with plasma cell myeloma. There is no mention of treatment or treatment plans in the medical record. Follow -back finds that the patient died three months after diagnosis. There are no additional medical records or other pertinent information available. Assign code 00 since there is no reason to suspect that the patient had been treated. 6. Do not code combination of ancillary drugs administered with single agent chemotherapeutic agents as multiple chemotherapy. For example, the administration of 5- FU (antimetabolite) and Leucovorin (ancillary drug) is coded to single agent (Code 02). 7. Assign code 82 when chemotherapy is a customary option for the primary site/ histology, but it was not administered due to patient risk factors, such as : a. Advanced age. b. Comorbid condition(s) (heart disease, kidney failure, other cancer, etc.) . 8. Assign code 87 when : a. The patient refused recommended chemotherapy . 177 b. The patient made a blanket refusal of all recommended treatment and chemotherapy is a customary option for the primary site/histology . c. The patient refused all treatment before any was recommended and chemotherapy is a customary option for the primary site/histology . 9. Assign code 88 when the only information available is : a.

Assign code 99 when there is no documentation that chemotherapy was recommended or administered . a. For death certificate only (DCO) cases . Chemotherapeutic Agents Chemotherapeutic agents are chemicals that affect cancer tissue by means other than hormonal manipulation. Chemotherapeutic agents can be divided into five groups. Alkylating agents Antimetabolites Natural products Targeted therapy Miscellaneous Alkylating Agents Alkylating agents are not cell -cycle -specific. Although they are toxic to all cells, they are most active in the resting phase of the cell. Alkylating agents directly damage DNA to prevent the cancer cell from reproducing. Alkylating agents are used to treat many different cancers including acut e and chronic leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and cancers of the lung, breast, and ovary. Because th e drugs damage DNA they can cause long- term damage to the bone marrow and can, in rare cases, lead to acute leukemia. The ri sk of leukemia from alkylating agents is \"dose- dependent.\" unique because they can cross the blood- brain barrier and can be used in treating brain tumors Metal salts: carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin Antimetabolites Antimetabolites are cell -cycle specific. Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within 178 the cell. When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they are unable to divide. Antimetabolites are classified according to the substances with which they interfere. Folic acid antagonist: methotrexate Plant Alkaloids are cell -cycle specific which means they attack the c ells during various phases of division. They block cell division by preventing microtubule function. Microtubules are vital for cell division. Without them, division cannot occur. Plant alkaloids, as the name implies, are derived from certain types of plants. Vinca antibiotics are also cell -cycle specific and act during multiple phases of the cell cycle. They are made from natural products and were first produced by the soil fungus Streptomyces. Antitumor antibiotics form free radicals that break DNA strands, stopping the multiplication of cancer interfere with the action of topoisomerase enzymes (topoisomerase I and II). They control the manipulation of the structure of DNA necessary for replication. Topoisomerase Targeted Therapy Targeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules (\"molecular targets\") that are involved in the growth, progression, and spread of cancer. Targeted cancer therapies are sometimes called \"molecularly targeted drugs,\" \"molecularly targeted therapies,\" \"precision medicines,\" or similar for Tumor Embolization The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), and the SEER Program hav e collaborated to clarify and r efine coding directives for tumor embolization and are jointly issuing the following instructions. Definitions Chemoembolization: A procedure in which the blood supply to the tumor is blocked surgically or mechanically and anticancer drugs are administered directly into the tumor. This permits a higher concentration of drug to be in contact with the tumor for a longer period of time. Radioembolization: Tumor embolization combined with the injection of small radioactive beads or coils into an organ or tum or. Tumor embolization: The intentional blockage of an artery or vein to stop the flow of blood through the desired vessel. Coding Instructions Code as Chemotherapy when the embolizing agent(s) is a chemotherapeutic drug(s). Use SEER*Rx to determine whether the drugs used are classified as chemotherapeutic agents. Use codes 01, 02, 03 as specific information regarding the agent(s) is documented. Example: The patient has hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer). From a procedure report: Under x -ray guidance, a small catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin. The catheter's tip is threaded into the artery in the liver that suppl ies blood flow to the tumor. Chemotherapy is injected through the catheter into the tumor and mixed with particles that embolize or block the flow of blood to the tumor. Do not code pre- surgical (pre- operative) embolization of hypervascular tumors with agents such as particles, coils, or alcohol as a treatment. Pre -surgical embolization is typically performed to prevent excess bleeding during the resection of the primary tumor. Examples where pre- surgical embolization is used include meningiomas, hemangioblastomas, paragangliomas, and renal cell metastases in the brain. 180 RX SUMM-- HORMONE Item # Length 1400 2 Alternate Name: Hormone Therapy (SEER/CoC) Endocrine (Hormone/Steroid) ID: rxSummHormone PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Records whether systemic hormonal agents were administered as first -course treatment at any facility, or the reason they were not given.

Even if the progesterone is given for menopausal symptoms, it has an effect on the growth or recurrence of endometrial cancer. Example 2: Follicular and papillary cancers of the thyroid are often treated with thyroid hormone to suppress serum thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH). If a patient with papillary and/or follicular cancer of the thyroid is given a thyroid hormone, code the treatment in this data item. Example 3: Bromocriptine suppresses the production of prolactin, which causes growth in pituitary adenoma. Code bromocriptine as hormone treatment for pituitary adenoma. Example 4: Lupron is a hormonal treatment for prostate cancer. Code as hormonal treatment when Lupron is given for prostate cancer. Example 5: Lupron is hormone therapy that has been approved as an ovarian suppressor for pre-menopausal breast cancer.

Assign code 0 when: a. There is no information in the patient's medical record about other therapy AND i. It is known that other therapy is not usually performed for this type and/or stage of cancer OR ii. There is no reason to suspect that the patient would have had other therapy . b. The treatment plan offered multiple treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include other therapy . c. Patient elects to pursue no treatment following the discussion of other therapy. Discussion does not equal a recommendation. Patient's decision not to pursue other therapy is not a refusal of other therapy in this situation. d. First course of treatment was active surveillance/watchful waiting. e. Patient diagnosed at autopsy . 2. Assign code 1 for : a. Hematopoietic treatments such as: phlebotomy or aspirin (See SEER*Rx and Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database for specific guidance on coding) i. Note: Do not code blood transfusion as treatment. 1. Rationale: Blood transfusions may be used for any medical condition that causes anemia. It would be virtually impossible for the registrar to differentiate between blood transfusions used for a co- morbidity (i.e., anemia) from those given as prophylactic t reatment of a hematopoietic neoplasm. b. PUVA (Psoralen (P) and long- wave ultraviolet radiation (UVA)) in the RARE event that it is used as treatment for extremely thin melanomas or cutaneous T -cell fungoides as photodynamic therapy under Surgery of Primary Site for skin. Assign code 11 [Photodynamic therapy (PDT)] if there is no pathology specimen. Assign code 21 [Photodynamic therapy (PDT)] if there is a pathology specimen. c. Photophoresis. This treatment is used ONLY for thin melanoma or T (PRRT) . e. Cancer treatment that could not be assigned to the previous treatment data items (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or systemic therapy) . 3. Assign code 2 for any experimental or newly developed treatment, such as a clinical trial, that differs greatly from proven types of cancer therapy . a. Note: Hyperbaric oxygen has been used to treat cancer in clinical trials, but it is also used to promote tissue healing following head and neck surgeries. Do not code the administration of hyperbaric oxygen to promote healing as an experimental treatment. 185 4. Assign code 3 when the patient is enrolled in a double blind clinical trial. When the trial is complete and the code is broken, review and recode the therapy. 5. Assign code 6 for : a. Cancer treatment administered by nonmedical personnel . i. Example: Cannabis oi l or medical marijuana that is used for treatment. b. Unconventional methods whether they are the only therapy or are given in combination with conventional therapy . i. Example: DC vax given for brain cancer. Assign code 6. DC vax is not an approved treatment for brain cancer and should not be coded in the immunotherapy or any of the other treatment data items. c. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) as any medical system, practice, or product that is not thought of as \"western medicine\" or standard medical care. CAM treatments may include dietary supplements, megadose vitamins, herbal preparations, acupuncture, massage therapy, magnet therapy, spiritual healing, and meditation. i. Alternative medicine is treatment that is used instead of standard medical treatments. Alternative therapy is when the patient receives no other type of standard treatment. ii. Complementary medicine. Treatments that are used along with standard medical treatments but are not standard treatments; also called conventional medicine. One example is using acupuncture to help lessen some side effects of cancer treatment in conjunction with standard treatment. d. Integrative medicine. A total approach to medical care that combines standard medicine with the CAM practices that have shown to be safe and effective. They treat the patient's mind, body, and spirit. i.

Assign code 8 when other therapy was recommended by the physician but there is no information that the treatment was given. 7. Assign code 9 when there is no documentation that other therapy was recommended or performed. a. For death certificate only (DCO) cases . Coding for Tumor Embolization The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), and the SEER Program have collaborated to clarify and refine coding directives for tumor embolization and are jointly issuing t he following instructions. Definitions Chemoembolization: A procedure in which the blood supply to the tumor is blocked surgically or 186 mechanically and anticancer drugs are administered directly into the tumor. This permits a higher concentration of drug to be in contact with the tumor for a longer period of time. Radioembolization: Tumor embolization combined with injecting small radioactive beads or coils into an organ or tumor. Tumor embolization: The intentional blockage of an artery or vein to stop the flow of blood through the desired vessel. Coding Instructions Code as \"Other Therapy\" when tumor embolization is performed using alcohol as the embolizing agent. Use code 1. Example: For head and neck primaries: Ideally, an embolic agent is chosen that will block the very small vessels within the tumor but spare the adjacent normal tissue. Liquid embolic agents, such as ethanol or acrylic, and powdered particulate materials can penetra te into the smallest blood vessels of the tumor. Use code 1 for embolization of a tumor in a site other than the liver when the embolizing agent is unknown. Do not code pre- surgical (pre- operative) embolization of hypervascular tumors wit h agents such as particles, coils, or alcohol as a treatment. Pre -surgical embolization is typically performed to prevent excess bleeding during the resection of the primary tumor. Examples where pre- surgical embolization is used include meningiomas, hemangioblastomas, paragangliomas, and in the SUMM--SCOPE REG LN SUR Item # Length 1292 1 Alternate Name: Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery (SEER/CoC) XML NAACCR ID: rxSummScopeRegLnSur PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Describes the removal, biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event at all facilities. Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery describes the procedure of removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional lymph nodes performed during the initial work -up or first course of therapy. Coding Instructions sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBx) have been clarified for 2012 and later, diagnoses. Additional instructions for breast primaries (C500- C509) are described below, following the general coding instructions. Rationale In evaluating quality -of-care and treatment practices, it is important to identify the removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event. Codes Refer to the most recent version of the STORE Manual and SEER Manual for additional instructions. The treatment of breast and skin cancers are where the distinction between sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBx) and more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes is most frequently encountered. For all other sites, non- sentinel regional node dissections are typic al, and codes 2, 6 and 7 are infrequently used. 0 No regional lymph nodes removed or aspirated; diagnosed at autopsy 1 Biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node, NOS 2 Sentinel lymph node biopsy [only] 3 Number of regional lymph nodes removed unknown, not stated; regional lymph nodes removed, NOS 4 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes removed 5 4 or more regional lymph nodes removed 188 6 Sentinel node biopsy and code 3, 4, or 5 at same time or timing not noted 7 Sentinel node biopsy and code 3, 4, or 5 at different times 9 Unknown or not applicable Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Use the entire operative report as the primary source document to determine whether the operative procedure was a SLNBx, or a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes, or a combination of both SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection. The body of the operative report will designate the surgeon's planned procedure as well as a description of the procedure that was actually performed. The pathology report may be used to complement the information appearing in the operative report, but the operative report takes precedence when attempting to distinguish between SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection or a combination of these two procedures. Do not use the number of lymph nodes removed and pathologically examined as the sole means of distinguishing between a SLNBx and a regional lymph node dissection. 2. Code r egiona l lymph node procedures in this data item. Record distant lymph node removal in Surgical Procedure of Other Site. a. Include lymph nodes that are regional in the current AJCC Staging Manual . 3. Record all surgical procedures that remove, biopsy, or aspirate regional lymph node(s) whether or not there were any surgical procedures of the primary site. The regional lymph node surgical procedure(s) may be done to diagnose cancer, stage the disease, or as a part of the initial treatment . b. Example: Patient has a sentinel node biopsy of a single lymph node. Assign code 2 (Sentinel lymph node biopsy [only]). 4. Include lymph nodes obtained or biopsied during any procedure within the first course of treatment. A separate lymph node surgery is not required. a. Code the removal of intra-organ lymph nodes in Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery . b. Example: Local excision of breast cancer. Specimen includes an intra-mammary lymph node. Assign code 4 (1 to 3 regional lymph nodes removed). 5. Add the number of all of the lymph nodes removed during each surgical procedure performed as part of the first course of treatment. The Scope of Regional Lymph Node data item is cumulative . a. Example: Patient has excision of a positive cervical node. The pathology report from a subsequent node dissection identifies three cervical nodes. Assign code 5 (4 or more regional lymph nodes removed). b. L ymph node aspirations : i. Do not double- count when a regional lymph node is aspirated, and that node is in the resection field. Do not add the aspirated node to the total number. ii. Count as an additional node when a regional lymph node is aspirated, and that node is NOT in the resection field. Add it to the total number. 189 iii. Assume the lymph node that is aspirated is part of the lymph node chain surgically removed and do not include it in the count when its location is not known. 6. Code the removal of regional nodes for both primaries when the patient has two primaries with common regional lymph nodes . a. Example: Patient has a cystoprostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for bladder cancer. Pathology identifies prostate cancer as well as the bladder cancer and 4/21 nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. Code Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery to 5 (4 or more regional lymph nodes removed) for both primaries. 7. Assign the appropriate code for occult head and neck primaries with positive cervical lymph nodes (schema 00060). Do not default to code 9 for this schema. 8. Assign code 0 when : a. Regional lymph node removal procedure was not performed OR i. Note: Excludes all sites and histologies that would be coded 9. (See Coding Instruction #13 below.) ii. First course of treatment was active surveillance/watchful waiting OR iii. The operative report lists a lymph node dissection, but no nodes were found by the pathologist . 9. Assign code 2 when : a. The operative report states that a SLNBx was performed OR b. The operative report describes a procedure using injection of a dye, radio label, or combination to identify a lymph node (possibly more than one) for removal/examination c. Note: When a SLNBx is performed, additional non- sentinel nodes can be taken during the same operative procedure. These additional non-sentinel nodes may be discovered by the pathologist or selectively removed (or harvested) as part of the SLNBx procedure by the surgeon. Code this as a SLNBx (code 2). If review of the operative report confirms that a regional lymph node dissection followed the SLNBx, code these cases as 6. 10. Codes 3, 4, and 5: The operative report states that a regional lymph node dissection was performed (a SLNBx was not done during this procedure or in a prior procedure) . a. Code 3: Check the operative report to ensure this procedure is not a SLNBx only (code 2), or a SLNBx with a regional lymph node dissection (code 6 or 7). b. Code 4 should be used infrequently. Review the operative report to ensure the procedure was not a SLNBx only. c. Code 5: If a relatively small number of nodes was examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm the procedure was not a SLNBx only (code 2). If a relatively large number of nodes was examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm that there was not a SLNBx in addition to a more extensive regional lymph node dissection during the same, or separate, procedure (code 6 or 7). d. Note: Infrequently, a SLNBx is attempted, and the patient fails to map (i.e., no sentinel lymph nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio label injection). When mapping fails, surgeons usually perform a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes. Code these cases as 2 if no further dissection of regional lymph nodes was undertaken, or 6 190 when regional lymph nodes were dissected during the same operative event. 11. Code 6: SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection (code 3, 4, or 5) during the same surgical event, or timing not known . a. Generally, SLNBx followed by a regional lymph node completion will yield a relatively large number of nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest only a few nodes. b. If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx only. c. Infrequently, a SLNBx is attempted, and the patient fails to map (i.e., no sentinel lymph nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio label injection). When mapping fails, the surgeon usually performs a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes. Code these cases as 6. 12. Code 7: SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection (code 3, 4, or 5) in separate surgical events . a. Generally, SLNBx followed by regional lymph node completion will yield a relatively large number of nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest only a few nodes. b. If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx only. 13. Code 9: The status of regional lymph node evaluation should be known for surgically treated cases (i.e., cases coded A190 -A900 or B190- B900 in the data item Surgery of Primary Site 2023 (NAACCR Item #1291). Review surgically treated cases coded as 9 in Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery to confirm the code. a. Assign code 9 for i. Any case coded to Breast ( C500 -C509 ) Source: SEER Manual 1. Use the entire operative report as the primary source document to determine whether the operative procedure was a SLNBx, an axillary node dissection (ALND), or a combination of both SLNBx and ALND. The body of the operative report will designate the surgeon's planned procedure as well as a description of the procedure that was actually performed. The pathology report may be used to complement the information appearing in the operative report, but the operative report takes precedence when attempting to distinguish between SLNBx and ALND, or a combination of these two procedures. Do not use the number of lymph nodes removed and pathologically examined as the sole means of distinguishing between a SLNBx and an ALND. 2. Code 1: a. Excisional biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph nodes for breast cancer is uncommon. Review the operative report to confirm whether an excisional biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph nodes was actually performed; it is highly possible that the procedure is a SLNBx (code 2) instead. If additional procedures were performed on the lymph nodes, such as axillary lymph node dissection, use the appropriate code 2- 7. 191 3. Code 2 a. If a relatively large number of lymph nodes, more than 5, are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm the procedure was limited to a SLNBx and did not include an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) . b. Infrequently, a SLNBx is attempted, and the patient fails to map (i.e., no sentinel lymph nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio label injection) and no sentinel nodes are removed. Review the operative report to confirm that an axillary incision was made, and a node exploration was conducted. Patients undergoing SLNBx who fail to map will often undergo ALND. Use code 2 if no ALND was performed, or 6 when ALND was performed during the same operative event. Enter the appropriate number of nodes examined and positive in the data items Regional Lymph Nodes Examined (NAACCR Item #830) and Regional Lymph Nodes Positive (NAACCR Item #820). 4. Codes 3, 4, and 5: Generally, ALND removes at least 7-9 nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to remove or harvest fewer nodes. Review the operative report to confirm that there was not a SLNBx in addition to a more extensive regional lymph node dissection during the same procedure (code 6 or 7). 5. Code 6: a. Generally, SLNBx followed by ALND will yield a minimum of 7-9 nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest fewer (or more) nodes. b. If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx, or whether a SLNBx plus an ALND was performed . 6. Code 7 a. Generally, SLNBx followed by ALND will yield a minimum of 7-9 nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest fewer (or more) nodes. b. If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx only, or whether a SLNBx plus an ALND was performed. 192 RX SUMM-- SURG OTH REG/DIS Item # Length 1294 1 Alternate Name: Surgery of Other Regional Site(s), Distant Site(s) or Distant Lymph Nodes (SEER/CoC) Surgical Procedure/Other Site XML NAACCR ID: rxSummSurgOthRegDis PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Records the surgical removal of distant lymph nodes or other tissue(s)/organ(s) beyond the primary site.

Do not code tissue or organs such as an appendix that were removed incidentally, and the organ was not involved with cancer a. Note: Incidental removal of organs means that tissue was removed for reasons other 193 than removing cancer or preventing the spread of cancer. Examples of incidental removal of organ(s) would be removal of appendix, gallbladder, etc., during abdominal surgery. 2. Do not code removal of uninvolved contralateral breast in this data item. See Surgery Codes for Breast in t he STORE Manual 3. For this data item, do not include organs beyond the primary site that are included in the Surgery of Primary Site 2023 codes . a. Example: A hemicolectomy including removal of the small bowel. Surgery of Primary Site 2023 code A410 for colon includes resection of contiguous organ such as small bowel or bladder. Do not code removal of small bowel or bladder performed with a subtotal colectomy/hemicolectomy in Surgical Procedure of Other Site. 4. Assign code 0 when: a. No surgical procedures were performed that removed distant lymph node(s) or other tissue(s) or organ(s) beyond the primary site, or b.

Note for melanoma skin surgical codes ONLY: The priority order for sources used to assign surgery codes: Operative report, statement from a physician, description of the surgical procedure on a pathology report, results of the pathology report. Code based on the description of the procedure. Do not code base on margin status documented in the pathology report. Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Code A000 or B000 when: a. No surgery was performed on the primary site, OR b. First course of treatment was active surveillance/watchful waiting, OR c. Case was diagnosed at autopsy . d. Note: Code A000 and B000 excludes all sites and histologies that would be coded as A980. (See Instruction 10 below.) 2. Use the site -specific coding scheme corresponding to the primary site or histology . 3. Code the most invasive, extensive, or definitive surgery if the patient has multiple surgical procedures of the primary site even if there is no residual tumor found in the pathologic specimen from the more extensive surgery . a. Example: Patient has a needle biopsy of prostate that is positive for adenocarcinoma. The patient chooses to have a radical prostatectomy. The pathologic examination of the prostatectomy specimen shows no residual tumor. Code the radical prostatectomy. 4. Code an excisional biopsy, even when documented as incisional, when: a. All disease is removed (margins free), OR b. All gross disease is removed and there is only microscopic residual at the margin . c. Note 1 : Do not code an incisional biopsy as an excisional biopsy when there is macroscopic residual disease. d. Note 2 : Shave or punch biopsies are most often diagnostic. Code as a surgical procedure only when the entire tumor is removed, and margins meet the criteria in either 4.a or 4.b above. i. Example: Shave biopsy performed for a suspicious lesion on the skin of the right arm that has been changing in size and color. The shave biopsy pathology report showed malignant melanoma with only microscopically positive margins. Code the shave biopsy as an excisional biopsy. 5. Code total removal of the primary site when a previous procedure resected a portion of the site, and the current surgery removed the rest of the organ. The previous procedure may have been cancer directed or non- cancer directed surger y. a. Example: Left thyroidectomy for suspicious nodules. Path showed papillary carcinoma. Completion thyroidectomy was performed. Code surgery of primary site as total thyroidectomy ( A500). 196 6. Assign the code that reflects the cumulative effect of all surgeri es to the primary site. a. When a previous surgical procedure to remove a portion of the primary site is followed by surgery to remove the remainder of the primary site, code the total or final results. Do not rely on registry software to perform this task. i. Example: The patient underwent a partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by an axillary lymph node dissection for the first right breast primary in 2011. The separate 2020 right breast primary was treated with a total mastectomy and rem oval of one involved axillary lymph node. The operative report only refers to this as a non- sentinel lymph node, with no mention of other axillary findings. Cumulatively, this patient has undergone a modified radical mastectomy since there were likely no r emaining axillary lymph nodes. For the 2020 primary, code the cumulative effect of the surgery done in 2011 plus the surgery performed in 2020. Use text fields on both abstracts to record the details. 7. Code the removal of regional or distant tissue/organs w hen they are resected in continuity with the primary site (en bloc) and that regional organ/tissue is listed in the Surgery of Primary Site 2023 codes. Specimens from an en bloc resection may be submitted to pathology separately. a. Example: Code an en bloc removal when the patient has a hysterectomy and an omentectomy. 8. Code surgery for extra -lymphatic lymphoma using the site- specific surgery coding scheme for the primary site. Do not use the lymph node scheme. 9. Assign the surgery code(s) that best represents the extent of the surgical procedure that was actually carried out when surgery is aborted. If the procedure was aborted before anything took place, assign code A000. See 1.a. above. 10. Code A800 , B800 or A900 only when there is no specific information . 11.

If none of these procedures were administered, then this item records the reason they were not performed. These include bone marrow transplants, st em cell harvests, surgical and/or radiation endocrine therapy. IMPORTANT: Justify code you enter in this field by completing the associated text field: TEXT - REMARKS Rationale This data item allows the evaluation of patterns of treatment, which involve the alteration of the immune system or change the patient's response to tumor cells but do not involve the administration of antineoplastic agents. Codes Refer to the most recent version of the STORE Manual and SEER Manual for additional instructions. 00 None, transplant procedure or endocrine therapy was not a part of the first course of therapy; not customary therapy for this cancer; diagnosed at autopsy only 10 Bone marrow transplant, NOS. A bone marrow transplant procedure was administered as first course of therapy, but the type was not specified 11 Bone marrow transplant autologous 12 Bone marrow transplant allogeneic 20 Stem cell harvest and infusion (stem cell transplant) 30 Endocrine surgery and/or endocrine radiation therapy as first course therapy 40 Combination of transplant procedure with endocrine surgery and/or endocrine radiation (Code 30 in combination with 10, 11, 12, or 20) as first course of therapy 82 Transplant procedure and/or endocrine therapy was not recommended/administered because it was contradicted due to patient risk factors (comorbid conditions/adv. age/etc.) 85 Transplant procedure and/or endocrine therapy was not administered because the 202 patient died prior to planned or recommended therapy 86 Transplant procedure and/or endocrine therapy was not administered; it was recommended by the patient's physician but was not administered as part of first course therapy. No reason was noted in the planned or recommended therapy. 87 Transplant procedure and/or endocrine therapy were not administered; this treatment was recommended by the patient's physician but was refused by the patient, a patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 88 Transplant procedure and/or endocrine therapy was recommended, but it is unknown if it was administered 99 It is unknown if a transplant procedure or endocrine therapy was recommended or administered because it is not stated in patient record Definitions Source: SEER Manual Bone marrow transplant (BMT): Procedure where bone marrow is used to restore stem cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy and/or radiation. Replacing the stem cells allows the patient to undergo higher doses of chemotherapy. BMT Allogeneic: Receives bone marrow from a donor. This includes haploidentical transplants. BMT Autolo gous: Uses the patient's own bone marrow. The tumor cells are filtered out and the purified blood and stem cells are returned to the patient. BMT Syngeneic: Bone marrow received from an identical twin. Conditioning: High- dose chemotherapy with or without radiation administered prior to transplant such as BMT and stem cells to kill cancer cells. This conditioning also destroys normal bone marrow cells, so the normal cells need to be replaced (rescue). The high dose chemotherapy is coded in the Chemotherapy field and the radiation is coded in the Rad. Treatment Modality --Phase I, II, III fields . Hematopoietic growth factors: A group of substances that support hematopoietic (blood cell) colony formation. The group includes erythropoietin, interleukin- 3, and colony -stimulating factors (CSFs). The growth- stimulating substances are ancillary drugs and not coded. Non-myeloablative therapy: Uses immunosuppressive drugs pre- and post -transplant to ablate (destroy) the bone marrow. These are not recorded as therapeutic agents. Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation (PBSCT): Rescue that uses peripheral blood stem cells to replace stem cells after conditioning. Rescue: Rescue is the actual BMT or PBSCT done after conditioning. Stem cells: Immature cells found in bone marrow, blood stream, placenta, and umbilical cords. The stem cells mature into blood cells. Stem cell transplant: Procedure to replenish supply of healthy blood -forming cells. Also known as bone marrow transplant, PBSCT, or umbilical cord blood transplant, depending on the source of the stem cells. When stem cells are collected from bone marrow and transplanted into a patient, the procedure is known as a b one marrow transplant . If the transplanted stem cells came from the bloodstream, the procedure is called a peripheral blood stem cell transplant , sometimes shortened to stem cell transplant. Umbilical cord stem cell transplant: Treatment with stem cells harvested from umbilical cord blood. 203 Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Assign code 00 when : a. The medical record states that there was no hematologic transplant or endocrine therapy, or these were not recommended, or not indicated. b. There is no information in the patient's medical record about transplant procedure or endocrine therapy AND i. It is known that transplant procedure or endocrine therapy is not usually performed for this type and/or stage of cancer OR ii.

Rationale A schema discriminator is used to assign AJCC ID [995] when site and histology alone are insufficient to identify the applicable AJCC staging method and to assign Schema ID [3800], which links each case to the appropriate SSDIs, Summary Stage and EOD data collection system. Codes (The information recorded in Schema Discriminator differs for each anatomic site. See the SSDI manual f or most current version of the site-specific codes and coding structures.)

The values for this data item are derived based on primary site, histology, and schema discriminator fields (when required). The derived values link Site- Specific Data Items with the appropriate site/histology grouping. For example, the Schema ID for an adenocarcinoma of the lung is 00360. This value links the Site - Specific Data Items associated with adenocarcinoma of the lung: Separate Tumor The Schema ID would also link to the appropriate grade data items an adenocarcinoma of the lung. The AJCC ID [995] code for Lung is 36. The AJCC ID [995] would link to the AJCC TNM Data items (Clin T, Clin N, Etc.) specific to Lung. AJCC ID [995] will not be assigned when a site/histology combination is not eligible for TNM staging. Rationale The purpose of the derived Schema ID is to link the appropriate Site -Specific Data Items with the patient's primary site/histology. This data item is similar to AJCC ID [995] but includes additional site/histologies that may not be eligible for TNM staging using the current AJCC Staging Manual. AJCC ID [995] is left blank if a case is not eligible for TNM Staging using the current AJCC Staging Manual. Separating AJCC ID [995] and the Schema ID allows coding of Site- Specific Data Items for site/histology combinations that are not eligible for an AJCC Stage but are eligible for Summary Stage. This data item will also be used to develop edits and could potentially be used for analysis. Codes See the SSDI Manual for codes. Each Site -Specific Data Item (SSDI) applies only to selected primary sites, histologies, and years of diagnosis.

No coding instruct ions are required. 226 SEQUENCE NUMBER --HOSPITAL Item # Length 560 2 Alternate Name: (CoC) XML NAACCR ID: sequenceNumberHospital PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Item indicates the sequence of all malignant and non- malignant neoplasms over the lifetime of the patient. The code may differ from the Sequence Number --Central [380] because the definitions of reportable neoplasms often vary between a hospital and a central registry. The two items also handle some types of tumors differently. Each neoplasm is assigned a different number. Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has only one malignant neoplasm in his lifetime (regardless of hospital registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more malignant neoplasms, while 02 indicates the second of two or more malignant neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person's lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the hospital registry are also allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm occurred before the hospital registry's reference date. Similarly, Sequence Number 60 indicates the patient has only one non- malignant neoplasm, and Sequence Number 61 represents the first of multiple non- malignant neoplasms. Sequence numbers should be reassigned if the facility subsequently learns of an unaccessioned tumor that affects sequencing. Sequence Number -Central [380] does not affect Sequence Number - Hospital. The two notational systems are independent. Rationale This data item is used to distinguish among cases having the same accession numbers, to select patients with only one malignant primary tumor for certain follow -up studies, and to analyze factors involved in the development of multiple tumors. Timing Rule If two or more m alignant tumors are diagnosed at the same time, the lowest sequence number will be assigned to the diagnosis with the worst prognosis. Likewise, if two or more non- malignant tumors are diagnosed at the same time, the lowest sequence number is assigned to the diagnosis with the worse prognosis. If no difference in prognosis is evident, the decision is arbitrary. 227 Codes Malignant or In Situ Primaries 00 One malignant or in situ primary only in the patient's lifetime 01 First of two or more independent malignant or in situ primaries 02 Second of two or more independent or in situ primaries ... (Actual sequence of this malignant or in situ primary) 59 Fifty-ninth of 59 or more independent malignant or in situ primaries Non-Malignant Primaries 60 One nonmalignant primary only in the patient's lifetime 61 First of two or more independent nonmalignant primaries 62 Second of two or more independent nonmalignant primaries ... (Actual sequence of this nonmalignant primary) 87 Twenty -seventh of 27 or more independent nonmalignant primaries 88 Unspecified number of independent nonmalignant primaries Coding Instructions Source: STORE Manual Codes 00- 59 and 99 indicate neoplasms of malignant (in situ or invasive) behavior (Behavior equals 2 or 3). Codes 60- 88 indicate neoplasms of non- malignant behavior (Behavior equals 0 or 1). Code 00 only if the patient has a single malignant primary. If the patient develops a subsequent invasive or in situ primary tumor, change the code for the first tumor from 00 to 01, and number subsequent tumors sequentially. Code 60 only if the patient has a single non- malignant primary. If the patient develops a subsequent non- malignant primary, change the code for the first tumor from 60 to 61, and assign codes to subsequent non- malignant primaries sequentially. If two or more invasive or in situ neoplasms are diagnosed at the same time, assign the lowest sequence number to the diagnosis with the worst prognosis. If no difference in prognosis is evident, the decision is arbitrary. Any tumor in the patient's past which is reportable or reportable- by-agreement at the time the current tumor is diagnosed must be taken into account when sequencing subsequently accessioned tumors. However, do not reassign sequence numbers if one of those tumors becomes non-reportable later. Sequence numbers should be reassigned if the facility learns later of an unaccession ed tumor that affects the sequence. 228 Examples Code Reason 00 Patient with no previous history of cancer diagnosed with in situ br east carcinoma on June 13, 2003 01 The sequence number is changed when the patient with an in situ breast carcinoma diagnosed June 13, 2003, is diagnosed with a subseque nt melanoma on August 30, 2003 02 Sequence number assigned to the melanoma diagnosed on August 30, 2003, following a breast cancer in situ diagnosis on June 13, 2003 04 A nursing home patient is admitted to the hospital for first course surgery for a colon adenocarcinoma. The patient has a prior history of three malignant cancers of the type the registry is required to accession, though the patient was not seen for these cancers at the hospital. No sequence numbers 01, 02 or 03 ar e accessioned for this patient. 60 The sequence number assigned to a benign brain tumor diagnosed on November 1, 2005, following a breast carcinoma diagnosed on June 13, 2003, an d a melanoma on August 30, 2003 63 Myeloproliferative disease (9975/1) is diagnosed by the facility in 2003 and accessioned as Sequence 60. A benign brain tumor was diagnosed and treated elsewhere in 2002; the patient comes to the facility with a second independent benign brain tumor in 2004. Unaccessioned earlier brain tumor is counted as Sequence 61, myeloproliferative disease is resequenced to 62, and second be nign brain tumor is Sequence 63 229 SEX Item # Length 220 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: sex PARENT XML ELEMENT: Patient Description Code for the sex of the patient. IMPORTANT: Remember to include the patient's sex in the PE text field. Rationale This data item is used to compare cancer rates and outcomes by site. The same sex code should appear in each medical record for a patient with multiple tumors . Codes 1 Male 2 Female 3 Other (intersex, disorders of sexual development/DSD). 4 Transsexual, NOS 5 Transsexual, natal male 6 Transsexual, natal female 9 Not stated/Unknown Definitions Intersex: A person born with ambiguous reproductive or sexual anatomy; chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XX -female. An 45,X/46,XY mosaicism, also known as X0/XY mosaicism. Transsexual: A person who was assigned one gender at birth based on physical characteristics but who self -identifies psychologically and emotionally as the other gender. Coding Instructions 1. Assign code 3 for : a. Intersexed (persons with sex chromosome abnormalities .) 230 b. Hermaphrodite. c. Note: Hermaphrodite is an outdated term. 2. Codes 5 and 6 may be used for cases diagnosed prior to 2015 . 3. Codes 5 and 6 have priority over codes 1 and 2. 4. Assign code 5 for transsexuals who are natally male or transsexuals with primary site of C600- C639. 5. Assign code 6 for transsexuals who are natally female or transsexuals with primary site of C510- C589 . 6. Assign code 4 for transsexuals with unknown natal sex and primary site is not C510- C589 or C600- C639 . 7. When gender is not known: a. Assign code 1 when the primary site is C6 00-C639. b. Assign code 2 when the primary site is C510- C589. c. Assign code 9 for primary sites not included above. 231 SITE CODING SYS--CURRENT Item # Length 450 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: siteCodingSysCurrent PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Code that best describes how the primary site currently is coded. If converted, this field shows the system to which it is converted.

The number is entered without dashes and without any letter suffix. This is not always identical to the Medicare claim number. IMPORTANT: This is a REQUIRED field; it is extremely important for accurate merging of cases submitted on different tumors or from different facilities for the same person. Many new Electronic Health Record systems are not making the SSN available to personnel in the facility system outside the billing staff. If you are unable to access the SSN in your medical chart or through your EHR for WCRS required reporting, you MUST contact your HIM and IT management immediately to make them aware of the reporting requirement so the software can be updated to allow access for reporting. Codes (in addition to social security number) 999999999 Unknown Coding Instructions 1. Code the patient's Social Security number . 2. Do not automatically enter a patient's Medicare claim number; it may not always be identical to the person's Social Security number . 3. See https://www.ssa.gov for more information. 233 SPANISH/HISPANIC ORIGIN Item # Length 190 1 Alternate Name: Spanish Origin --All Sources (96 CoC) Spanish Surname or Origin (SEER) XML NAACCR ID: spanishHispanicOrigin PARENT XML ELEMENT: Patient Description Code identifying persons of Spanish or Hispanic origin. This code is used by hospital and central registries to show the \"best guess\" as to whether or not the person should be classified as Hispanic for purposes of calculating cancer rates. If the patient has multiple tumors, all records should have the same code. IMPORTANT: Justify the code you enter in this field by including Hispanic information in the PE text field. All information resources should be used to determine the correct code, including: Stated ethnicity in the medical record Stated Hispanic origin on the death certificate Birthplace Information about life history and/or language spoken found during the abstracting process Patient's last name [2230] or Name \u2014Birth Surname [2232] found on a list of Hispanic names Some registries code the information from the medical record, others code ethnicity based on Spanish names, and others use a combination of methods. Persons of Spanish or Hispanic origin may be of any race, but these categories generally are not used for Native Americans, Filipinos, etc., who may have Spanish names. If a patient has a Hispanic name, but there is reason to believe they are not Hispanic (e.g., the patient is Filipino, or the patient is a woman known to be non- Hispanic who has a Hispanic married name), the code in this field should be 0 (non- Spanish, non- Hispanic). The code in item Computed Ethnicity [200], however, would reflect the Hispanic name. Assign code 7 if Hispanic ethnicity is based strictly on a computer list or algorithm (unless contrary evidence is available) and also code in Computed Ethnicity [200]. Note: NAACCR recognizes that available definitions and instructions for Name-- Last [2230] and Name\u2014Birth Surname [2232] may be inadequate for describing names used in some cultures, including Hispanic cultures. Explicit instructions have not been provided for entering compound names, with or without hyphens or \"De.\" Order of names, use of maternal and paternal names, and use of hyphens can vary across cultures. It is likely that abstracting and coding practice for these items varies across regist ries. Limitations inherent in these definitions should be kept in mind when using the data. 234 Codes 0 Non-Spanish/Non- Hispanic 1 Mexican (includes Chicano) 2 Puerto Rican 3 Cuban 4 South or Central American (except Brazil) 5 Other specified Spanish/Hispanic origin (includes European; excludes Dominican Republic) 6 Spanish, NOS; Hispanic, NOS; Latino, NOS There is evidence, other than surname or birth sur name, that the person is Hispanic, but he/she cannot be assigned to any of the categories 1- 5 7 For central registry use only. Spanish surname only (effective with diagnosis on or after 01/01/1994) The only evidence of the person's Hispanic origin is the surname or maiden name (birth surname) and there is no evidence that he/she is not H ispanic 8 Dominican Republic (effective with diagnosis on or after 01/01/2005) 9 Unknown whether Spanish/Hispanic or not Coding Instructions 1. Coding Spanish Surname or Origin is not dependent on race. A person of Spanish descent may be white, black, or any other race. 2. Use all information to determine the Spanish/Hispanic Origin incl uding: a. The ethnicity stated in the medical record . i. Self-reported information takes priority over other sources of information. b. Hispanic origin stated on the death certificate . c. Birthplace . d. Information about life history and/or language spoken found in the abstracting process . 3. Assign code 6 when there is more than one ethnicity/origin (multiple codes), such as Mexican (code 1) and Dominican Republic (code 8). There is n o hierarchy among the codes 1- 5 or 8. 4. Assign code 9 a. For death certificate only (DCO) cases when Spanish/Hispanic origin is unknown b. When there is no written or verbal indication of Spanish origin, the patient declined to answer their Spanish origin, or the patient does not know their Spanish origin i. Example: The patient's race is white or black, they were born in the United States, and there is no mention of Spanish origin in the patient record. 235 Coding Examples Example 1: Married female, no married name, Race 99, born in Mexico, Code as 1 (Mexican) using coding instruction 2.c. Example 2: Married female, no maiden name (birth surname), Race 01, born in Philippines, and medical record states \"Hispanic.\" Code as 6 (Hispanic, NOS) using coding instruction 2.a. Example 3: Married female, no maiden name (birth surname), Race 99, born in Peru, no statement regarding ethnicity available. Code as 4 (South or Central America) using coding instruction 2.c. 236 SUMMARY STAGE 2018 Item # Length 764 1 Alternate Name: Directly Assigned SS2018 XML NAACCR ID: summaryStage2018 PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description This item stores the directly assigned Summary Stage 2018 for cases diagnosed 1/1/2018+. Summary stage should include all information available through completion of surgery(ies) as part of the first course of treatment or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer. Rationale The SEER program ha s collected staging information on cases since its inception in 1973. Summary Stage groups cases into broad categories of in situ, local, regional, and distant. Summary Stage can be used to evaluate disease spread at diagnosis, treatment patterns and outco mes over time. Codes 0 In situ 1 Localized only 2 Regional by direct extension only 3 Regional lymph nodes only 4 Regional by BOTH direct extension AND regional lymph nodes 7 Distant site(s)/node(s) involved 8 Benign, borderline* 9 Unknown if extension or metastasis (unstaged, unknown, or unspecified) Death certificate only (DCO) case *Applicable for the following SS2018 5 for \"Regional, NOS\" can no longer be coded.

Rationale Used to identify new work -related health hazards; serves as an additional measure of socioeconomic status; identifies industrial groups or worksite- related groups in which cancer screening or prevention activities may be beneficial. The data item \"usual industry\" is defined identically as on death certificates and conforms to the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death.25 See related materials in reference list, Chapter VII. Abstracting Instructions All caps (capitalizing every letter) are recommended and is the current standard. Mixed case is accepted but not preferred. Record the primary type of activity carried on by the business/industry at the location where the patient was employed for the most number of years before diagnosis of this tumor. Be sure to distinguish among \"manufacturing,\" \"wholesale,\" \"retail,\" and \"service\" components of an i ndustry that performs more than one of these components. If the primary activity carried on at the location where the patient worked is unknown, it may be sufficient for facility registrars to record the name of the company (with city or town) in which the patient performed his/her usual industry. In these situations, if resources permit, a central or regional registry may be able to use the employer name and city/town to determine the type of activity conducted at that location. As noted in the Text --Usual Occupation [310] section, in those situations where the usual occupation is not available or is unknown, the patient's current or most recent occupation is recorded, if available. The information for industry should be based upon the information in occupation. Therefore, if current or most recent occupation rather than usual occupation was recorded, record the patient's current or most recent business/industry. If later documentation in the patient's record provides an industry that is more likely to be the usual industry than what was originally recorded, facility registrars are encouraged to update the abstract with the new information. However, it is not the responsibility of the facility registrars to update 263 abstracts with industry information provided on death certificates. Comparison with death certificate information should be the function of a central or regional registry. There should be an entry for Text --Usual Industry if any occupation is recorded. If no information is available regarding the industry in which the reported occupation was carried out, record \"unknown.\" If the patient was not a student or homemaker and had never worked, record \"never worked\" as the usual industry. This data item usually is collected only for patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis. 264 TEXT --USUAL OCCUPATION Item # Length 310 100 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: textUsualOccupation PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Text area for information about the patient's usual occupation, also known as usual type of job or work. Rationale Used to identify new work -related health hazards; serves as an additional measure of socioeconomic status; identifies occupational groups in which cancer screening or prevention activities may be beneficial. Abstracting Instructions Capitalizing every letter (i.e., caps lock, all letters uppercase) is recommended and the current standard. Mixed case is accepted but not preferred. Record the patient's usual occupation (i.e., the kind of work performed during most of the patient's working life before diagnosis of this tumor). Do not record \"retired.\" If usual occupation is not available or is unknown, record the patient's current or most recent occupation, or any available occupation. If later documentation in the patient's record provides an occupation that is more likely to be the usual occupation than what was originally recorded, facility registrars are encouraged to update the abstract with the new information. However, it is not the responsibility of the facility registrars to update abstracts with occupation information provided on death certificates. Comparison with death certificate information should be the function of a central or regional registry. If the patient was a homemaker and also worked outside the home during most of his/her adult life, record the usual occupation outside the home; if the patient was a homemaker and did not work outside the home for most of his/her adult life, record \"homemaker.\" If the patient was not a student or homemaker and had never worked, record \"never worked\" as the usual occupation. If no information is available, record \"unknown.\" This data item usually is collected only for patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis. 265 TOBA CCO USE SMOKING STATUS Item # Length 344 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: tobaccoUseSmokingStatus PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description Tobacco Use Smoking Status, effective 01/01/2022, captures the patient's past or current use of tobacco (cigarette, cigar and/or pipe). Record the patient 's past or current use of tobacco (cigarette, cigar and/or pipe). Tobaccos smoking history can be obtained from sections such as the Nursing Interview Guide, Flow Chart, Vital Stats or Nursing Assessment section, or other available source from the patient 's hospital medical record or physician office record. Rationale Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in t he US and a major risk factor for cancer. Reducing tobacco use is a focus of CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Reliable registry -based tobacco use data will help public health planners and clinicians target populations of cancer survivors for tobacco cessation. In addition, individual states have reported smoking data on patients are a useful covariate risk factor for cancer cluster investigations. Some state central cancer registries collect tobacco use data, but th ese variables are not standardized among registries. In addition to describing tobacco use patterns and trends in patients diagnosed with cancer, the collection of cigarette smoking history can enable researchers to better understand the association of cigarette smoking to cancer outcomes. Cigarette use data at diagnosis may help health professionals better understand how tobacco use impacts cancer prognosis, including how smoking is related to effectiveness of treatment and survival. In addition, this info rmation is important to target and assess tobacco control efforts to cancer survivors and their families. Codes 0 Never Smoker 1 Current Smoker 2 Former Smoker 3 Smoker, current status unknown 9 Unknown if ever smoked Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual 1. Record the past or current use of tobacco 266 a. Tobacco use includes cigarette, cigar, and/or pipe 2. Do not record the patient's past or current use of e- cigarette vaping devices 3. Assign code 1 when a. The patient currently smokes OR b. It is known that the patient stopped smoking within 30 days prior to diagnosis. The risks associated with smoking decrease as the time from cessation increases which means a person who stopped smoking within the last 30 days has the same risks as a current smoker. 4. Assign code 2 when the medical record indicates a. \"Former smoker\" b. Patient has smoked tobacco in the past but does not smoke now i. Note : If there is evidence in the medical record that the patient quit recently (within 30 days prior to diagnosis), assign code 1, current smoker. The 30 days prior information, if available, is intended to differentiate patients who may have quit recently due to symptoms that lead to a cancer diagnosis . 5. Assign cod e 3 when a. The patient is noted to have smoked, but the current smoking status is not known b. It is known that the patient \"recently\" stopped smoking, but it is not known how long ago the patient stopped smoking 6. Assign code 9 when a. The medical record only indicates \"No\" b. The record has no information about smoking status or history (e.g., pathology report only) c. It is documented that the patient uses or used smokeless or chewing tobacco or e-cigarettes or vapes, but tobacco use is not mentioned 267 TUM OR SIZE SUMMARY Item # Length 756 3 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: tumorSizeSummary PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description This data item records the most accurate measurement of a solid primary tumor, usually measured on the surgical resection specimen. Rationale Tumor size is one indication of the extent of disease. As such, it is used by both clinicians and researchers. Tumor size that is independent of stage is also useful for quality assurance efforts. Codes See the most recent version of the STORE Manual for additional instructions. 000 No mass/tumor found 001 1 mm or described as less than 1 mm 002-988 Exact size in millimeters (2 mm to 988 mm) 989 989 millimeters or larger 990 Microscopic focus or foci only and no size of focus is given 998 SITE -SPECIFIC CODES Alternate descriptions of tumor size for specific -C16.9) Diffuse, entire size not stated Not documented in patient record Size of tumor cannot be assessed Not applicable 268 Coding Instructions Source: STORE Manual Note: all measurements should be in millimeters (mm) Record size in specified order: 1. Size measured on the surgical resection specimen, when surgery is administered as the first definitive treatment, i.e., no pre- surgical treatment admini stered. a. If there is a discrepancy among tumor size measurements in the various sections of the pathology report, code the size from the synoptic report (also known as CAP protocol or pathology report checklist). If only a text report is available, use: final diagnosis, microscopic, or gross examination, in that order. Example: Chest x -ray shows 3.5 cm mass; the pathology report from the surgery states that the same mass is malignant and measures 2.8 cm. Record tumor size as 028 (28 mm) . Example: Pathology report states lung carcinoma is 2.1 cm x 3.2 cm x 1.4 cm. Record tumor size as 032 (32 mm). 2. If neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, do not record the size from the pathologic specimen. Code the largest size of tumor prior to neoadjuvant treatment; if unknown code size as 999. a. Example: Patient has a 2.2 cm mass in the oropharynx; find needle aspiration of mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. Patient receives a course of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy. Pathologic size after total resection is 2.8 cm. Record tumor size as 022 (22mm). 3. If no surgical resection, then largest measurement of the tumor from the imaging, physical exam, or other diagnostic procedures in this order of priority prior to any other form of treatment (See Coding Rules below). 4. If 1, 2, and 3 do not apply, the largest size from all information available within four months of the date of diagnosis, in the absence of disease progression. Coding Rules Source: STORE Manual 1. Tumor size is the diameter of the tumor, not the depth or thickness of the tumor. 2. Recording less than/greater than Tumor Size: a. If tumor size is reported as less than x mm or less than x cm, the reported tumor size should be 1 mm less; for example, if size is <10 mm, code size as 009. Often these are given in cm such as < 1 cm which is coded as 009, < 2 cm is coded as 019, < 3 cm i s coded as 029, < 4 cm is coded as 039, < 5 cm is coded as 049. If stated as less than 1 mm, use code 001. b. If tumor size is reported as more than x mm or more than x cm, code size as 1 mm more; for example, if size is >10 mm, size should be coded as 011. O ften these are given in cm such as > 1 cm, which is coded as 011, > 2 cm is coded as 021, > 3 cm is coded as 031, > 4 cm is coded as 041, > 5 cm is coded as 051. If described as anything greater than 989 mm (98.9 cm) code as 989. c. If tumor size is reported to be between two sizes, record tumor size as the midpoint 269 between the two: i.e., add the two sizes together and then divide by two (\"between 2 and 3 cm\" is coded as 025). 3. Rounding: Round the tumor size only if it is described in fractions of millimeters. If the largest dimension of a tumor is less than 1 millimeter (between 0.1 and 0.9 mm), record size as 001 (do not round down to 000). If tumor size is greater than 1millimeter, round tenths of millimeters in the 1 -4 range down to the nearest whole millimeter, and round tenths of millimeters in the 5 -9 range up to the nearest whole millimeter. Do not round tumor size expressed in centimeters to the nearest whole centimeter (rather, move the decimal point one space to the right, converting the measur ement to millimeters). For breast cancer, follow the AJCC 8 th Edition, Breast Chapter. a. Examples Breast cancer described as 6.5 millimeters in size. Round up Tumor Size as 007. Cancer in polyp described as 2.3 millimeters in size. Round down Tumor Size as 002. Focus of cancer described as 1.4 mm in size. Round down as 001. 5.2 mm breast cancer. Round down to 5 mm and code as 005 . 4. Priority of imaging/radiographic techniques : Information on size from imaging/radiographic techniques can be used to code the tumor size when there is no more specific size information from pathology or operative report. It should be taken as a lower priority, but over a physical exam. 5. Tumor size discrepancies among imaging and radiographic reports : If there is a difference in reported tumor size among imaging and radiographic techniques, unless the physician specifies which imaging is most accurate, record the largest size in the record, regardles s of which imaging technique reports it. 6. Always code the size of the primary tumor, not the size of the polyp, ulcer, cyst, or distant metastasis . However, if the tumor is described as a \"cystic mass,\" and only the size of the entire mass is given, code th e size of the entire mass, since the cysts are part of the tumor itself. 7. Record the size of the invasive component, if given. a. If both an in situ and an invasive component are present and the invasive component is measured, record the size of the invasive c omponent even if it is smaller. Example: Tumor is mixed in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma, total 3.7 cm in size, of which 1.4 cm is invasive. Record tumor size as 014 (14 mm) . b. If the size of the invasive component is not given, record the size of the entire tumor from the surgical report, pat hology report, radiology report or clinical examination. Example: A breast tumor with infiltrating duct carcinoma with extensive in situ component; total size 2.3 cm. Record tumor size as 023 (23 mm). Example: Duct carcinoma in situ measuring 1.9 cm with an area of invasive ductal carcinoma. Record tumor size as 019 (19 mm). 8. Record the largest dimension or diameter of tumor, whether it is from an excisional biopsy specimen or the complete resection of the primary tumor. 270 a. Example: Tumor is described as 2.4 x 5.1 x 1.8 cm in size. Record tumor size as 051 (51 mm). 9. Record the size as stated for purely in situ lesions. 10. Disregard microscopic residual or positive surgical margins when coding tumor size . Microscopic residual tumor does not affect overall tumor size. The status of primary tumor margins may be recorded in a separate data item. 11. Do not add the size of pieces or chips together to create a whole; they may not be from the same location, or they may represent only a very small portion of a large tumor. How ever, if the pathologist states an aggregate or composite size (determined by fitting the tumor pieces together and measuring the total size), record that size. If the only measurement describes pieces or chips, record tumor size as 999. 12. Multifocal/multice ntric tumors : If the tumor is multi -focal or if multiple tumors are reported as a single primary, code the size of the largest invasive tumor or if all of the tumors are in situ, code the size of the largest in situ tumor. 13. Tumor size code 999 is used when size is unknown or not applicable . Sites/morphologies where tumor size is not applicable are listed a. Primary Body f. Melanoma Iris 14. Tumor size code 000 is used for the following schema: a. Schema is Cervical Lymph Nodes and Unknown Primary 00060. b. Occult Cervical Lymph Node - See STORE Manual 15. Document the information to support coded tumor size in the appropriate text data item of the abstract. 16. Tumor size is also important for staging for some sites/schemas and schema ID s. See the STORE Manual for a full list. 271 TYPE OF REPORTING SOURCE Item # Length 500 1 Alternate Name: XML NAACCR ID: typeOfReportingSource PARENT XML ELEMENT: Tumor Description This variable codes the source documents used to abstract the majority of information on the tumor being reported. This may not be the source of original case finding (for example, if a case is identified through a pathology laboratory report review and all source documents used to abstract the case are from the physician's office, code this item 4). Rationale The code in this field can be used to explain why information may be incomplete on a tumor. For example, death certificate only cases have unknown values for many data items, so one may want to exclude them from some analyses. The field also is used to monitor the success of non- hospital case reporting and follow -back m echanisms. All population- based registries should have some death certificate -only cases where no hospital admission was involved, but too high a percentage can imply both shortcomings in case- finding and that follow -back to uncover missed hospital report s was not complete. Codes 1 Hospital inpatient; Managed health plans with comprehensive, unified medical records 2 Radiation Treatment Centers or Medical Oncology Centers (hospital affiliated or independent) 3 Laboratory Only (hospital affiliated or independent) 4 Physician's Office/Private Medical Practitioner (LMD) 5 Nursing/Convalescent Home/Hospice 6 Autopsy Only 7 Death Certificate Only 8 Other hospital outpatient units/surgery centers Definitions Source: SEER Manual Compre hensive, unified medical record 272 A hospital or managed health care system that maintains a single record for each patient. That record includes all encounters in affiliated locations. Stand -alone medical record An independent facility; a facility that is not a part of a hospital or managed care system . An independent medical record containing only information from encounters with that specific facility or practice . Managed health plan Any practice and/or facility where all of the diagnostic and treatment information is maintained in one unit record. The abstractor is able to use the unit record when abstracting the case. Examples of such facilities: HMOs or other health plan such as Kaiser, Veterans Administration, or military facilities . Physician office A physician office performs examinations and tests. Physician offices may perform limited surgical procedures . Note: The category \"physician's office\" also includes facilities that are called surgery centers when surgical procedures under general anesthesia cannot be performed in t hese facilities. Unit record All records for the patient from all departments, clinics, offices, etc. in a single file with the same medical record number . Coding Instructions Source: SEER Manual Code in the following priority order: 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7. This is a change to reflect the addition of codes 2 and 8 and to prioritize laboratory reports over nursing home reports. The source facilities included in the previous code 1 (hospital inpatient and outpatient) are split between codes 1, 2, and 8. This data item is intended to indicate the completeness of information available to the abstractor. Reports from health plans (e.g., Kaiser, Veterans Administration, military facilities) in which all diagnostic and treatment information is maintained centrally and is available to the abstractor are expected to be at least as complete as reports for hospital inpatients, which is why these sources are grouped with inpatients and given the code with the highest priority. Sources coded with '2' usually have complete information on the cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Sources coded with '8' would include, but would not be limited to, outpatient surgery and nuclear medicine services. A physician's office that calls itself a surgery center should be coded as a physician's office. Surgery centers are equipped and staffed to perform surgical procedures under general anesthesi a. If a physician's office calls itself a surgery center, but cannot perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia, code as a physician office. Priority Order for Assigning Type of Reporting Source 273 Source: SEER Manual 1. Code the source that provided the best information used to abstract the case. a. Example: The only patient record available for a physician office biopsy is the pathology report identified from a freestanding laboratory. Assign code 3 [Laboratory Only (hospital -affiliated or independent)]. Reporting source should reflect the lab where this case was identified. The MD office added nothing to the case, not even a confirmation of malignancy. 2. When multiple source documents are used to abstract a case, use the following priority order to assign a code for Type of Reporting Source: Codes: 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7. a. Note: Beginning with cases diagnosed 01/01/2006, the definitions for this data item have been expanded. Codes 2 and 8 were added to identify outpatient sources that were previously grouped under code 1. Laboratory reports now have priority over nursing home reports. The source facilities included in the previous code 1 (hospital inpatient and outpatient) are split between codes 1, 2, and 8. 3. SEER recommends that you do not make changes to this data item for historic cases in the central cancer registry database, i.e., cases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2006. Conversion of the old codes would be problematic and would require ex tensive and time- consuming review of original source documents. Code Label Source Documents Priority 1 Hospital inpatient; Managed health plans with comprehensive, unified medical records Hospital inpatient Offices/facilities with a comprehensive, unified record HMO physician office or group HMO -affiliated freestanding laboratory, surgery, radiation or oncology clinic Includes outpatient services of HMOs and large multi - specialty physician group practices with unified records. 1 2 Radiation Treatment Centers or Medical Oncology Centers (hospital -affiliated or independent) Facilities with a stand -alone medical record Radiation treatment centers Medical oncology centers (hospital affiliated or independent) There were no source documents from code 1. 2 3 Laboratory Only (hospital -affiliated or independent) Laboratory with a stand- alone medical record There were no source documents from codes 1, 2, 8, or 4. 5 4 Physician's Office Private Medical Practitioner (LMD ) Physician's o ffice that is NOT an HMO or large multi - specialty physician group practice There were no source documents from codes 1, 2, or 8. 4 5 Nursing/Convalescent Home/Hospice Nursing or convalescent home or a hospice There were no source documents from codes 1, 2, 8, 4, or 3. 6 274 6 Autopsy Only Autopsy The cancer was first diagnosed on autopsy.
