Lancet Digit Health ; 5(4): e206-e216, 2023 04. Artigo rapid [vaccination]in the paediatric [population]. However, there are few studies of adverse events associated with [vaccination]in [children]. The aim of this study was to systematically assess the adverse events of two- [dose] [BNT162b2] [vaccination]in [dose]series of the [BNT162b2] [vaccine]between Jan 5, 2021, and Aug 2022, at Mayo Clinic [Health System](MN, FL, AZ, IA, WI), USA. Using [natural processing], we automatically curated adverse events reported by [physicians]in EHR clinical notes before and after [vaccination]. To determine significant adverse events after [BNT162b2] [vaccination], we calculated [risk]differences, which was defined as the percentage difference between the rate of [children]with an [adverse event]after a [vaccine] [adverse event]before [vaccination]. 95% CIs and p values calculated the Miettinen and Nurminen score [method]. with EHRs in the Mayo Clinic [Health Systems]were included in the study. Overall, the [reporting]of adverse events remained low in passive [surveillance]. Serious adverse events were rare after the first and second doses of [BNT162b2], with rates of [anaphylaxis](six [0\u00b701%] of 56\u00e2436), [myocarditis](five [0\u00b701%]), the 20\u00e2227 5-11-year-olds, there were increased [risks]of [fatigue](58 12-17-year-olds, there were increased [risks]of to after the second [dose]. Although the overall [incidence]was low, there was an increased [risk]of [myocarditis]in [males] [aged]12-17 years after the second first [dose]; RDdose2 0\u00b703% [0\u00b701 to 0\u00b707], p=0\u00b7013), with median age being 15 years (IQR 14 to 16). INTERPRETATION:Overall, this data suggests that [vaccination]with [BNT162b2]in the paediatric [population]is generally safe and well-tolerated. Further [research]is warranted to investigate the basis for the increased [risk]of [myocarditis]in [adolescent] [males]. Additionally, further studies are needed to confirm whether the findings in our study [population]apply to the whole vaccinated "}
