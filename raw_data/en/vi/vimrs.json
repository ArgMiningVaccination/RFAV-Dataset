Investigating \"Nature-Deficit Disorders\" as a Medical Matter [Sara L. Warber, M.D.](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/family-medicine/sara-l-warber-md), Principal Investigator Funded by The Fulbright Scholar Program This is to open dialogue among medical clinicians about nature-deficit disorder and its remedies. I will define 'nature-deficit disorder,' identify vulnerable populations, evaluate nature interventions, propose a model of influences, covariates, and outcomes relevant to the effects of nature on human health, and describe gaps in the research and outcome measures to inform future studies.
