Among influenza viruses typed since week 40, virtually all have been influenza A and, among those subtyped at the BCCDC PHL , more than 90 % have been A(H1N1)pdm09. Children under 10 years of age and non -elderly adults comprise 80 % of all A (H1N1)pdm09 detections to date in BC, with children in particular disproportionately affected . Conversely, elderly adults comprise 62% of A(H3N2) detections thus far in BC . In week 6, one laboratory -confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak in a long term care facility (LTCF) has been reported. The cumulative tally of LTCF influenza outbreaks during this predominant A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic in 2018 -19 remains far below that of prior A(H3N2) -dominant seasons in 2017 -18 and 2016 -17 (20, 122, and 161 outbreaks, respectively). Interim estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) were published today from the United States (US) for the 2018 - 19 influenza season . US estimates indicate substantial protection against medically -attended influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 illness , albeit lower than reported earlier from Canada, Hong Kong, and Australia ( the latter for their 2018 southern hemisphere season). Multiple factors may explain variation in VE estimates. Please see within (page 14) for details .

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 3 BC Children's Hospital Emergency Room The proportion of visits to BC Children's Hospita l Emergency Room (ER) attribut ed to ILI has remain ed stable since week 3, with rates fluctuating between 18% and 19% . Although slightly higher than the historical average, this rate continues to remain within expected levels for this time of the year (Figure 2 ).

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 4 Medical Services Plan In week 6, BC Medical Services Plan (MSP) general practitioner claims for influenza illness (II), as a proporti on of all submit ted MSP claims , remained stable in the province overall (Figure 3). Notably, II claims in the Northern Health Authority have fallen below the 10 -year minimum (Figure 4).

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 5 Figure 4 Interior Fraser Vancouver Coastal Vancouver Island Northern BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 6 British Col umbia Laboratory Reports In recognition of expanded influenza testing by additional laboratories across British Columbia (BC), this section of the bulletin now include s respiratory specimens tested at sites beyond the BCCDC Public Health Laboratory (PHL) in deriving the test -positivity indicator . This change was implemented in the bulletin issued week 4 8 and represents a change from earlier bulletins of this and previous seasons . Influenza A s ubtype distribution will continue to be derived from the BCCDC PHL. Cumulatively, during the 2018 -19 season (since week 40, starting October 1, 2018), 3693 (22%) specimens tested positive for influenza at participating laboratories across BC (as submitted to FluWatch) , of which 99.4% were influenza A and 0.6% were influenza B . In week 6, 169 (18%) specimens tested positive for i nfluenza at these laboratories, which represents a continued decrease in the proportionate pos itivity since week 4 (27%) (Figure 5 ). Cumulatively, during the 2018 -19 season (since week 40, starting October 1, 2018), 2524 patients tested positive for influenza at the BCCDC PHL, of which 2508 (99.4%) were typed as influenza (80%) A(H1N1)pdm09, 312 (13%) subtype unknown] and (0.6%) as B. Among influenza A viruses subtyped, 2016 /2196 (92%) were A(H1N1)pdm09. Of 91 typed influen za viruses in week 6, 89 (98%) were typed as influenza A and 2 (2%) w ere typed as influenza B. Among the influenza A viruses, 9 (10%) were identified as A(H3N2), 28 (31%) as A(H1N1)pdm09, and for 52 (58%) subtype unknow n. In week 6, therefore , 28/37 (76%) influenza A viruses subtyped were A(H1N1)pdm09 (Figure 6). Since week 40, approximately half (5 2%) of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections were among adults 20 -64 year s of age (Figure 8 ). Twenty -four percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections were observed among children 9 years who comprise about 10% of the BC population, suggesting they have been disproportionately affected. Children aged 10-19 years comprised a smaller proportion of cases (5%). Twenty percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections have been among elderly adults 65 years of age. Conversely , the majority ( 62%) of A(H3N2) detections have been among elderly adults 65 years of age, despite comprising about 18% of the population in BC1. Respiratory syncytial viruses (n=49) were the most commonly detected other respiratory virus (excluding influenza) at the BCCDC in week 6 (Figure 6 ).

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 9 BC Children's and Women's Health Centre Laboratory In week 6, 126 tests for influenza and 121 tests for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were conducted at the BC Children's and Women's Health Centre laboratory. Of these, 14 (11%) were positive for influenza A (not subtyped), 1 (1%) was positive for influenza B, and 29 (24%) were positive for RSV. Influenza A positivity has steadily decreased since week 4 , while RSV test positivity has increased slightly from week 5 to week 6 (18% versus 24% , respectively ). Influenza B positivity remains stable at very low levels (Figure 9). Figure 9: Influenza and other virus detections among respiratory specimens submitted to BC Children's and Women's Health Centre Laboratory, 2018 -19 * Positive rates were calculated using aggregate data. The denominators for each rate represent the total number of tests; multiple tests may be performed for a single specimen and/or patient. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 10 Influenza -like Illness (ILI) Outbreaks One laboratory -confirmed long-term care facility (LTCF) outbreak of influenza A (subtype unknown) and one ILI school outbreak were reported in week 6. Since week 40, a total of 20 LTCF outbreaks (3 A(H3N2) , 10 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 7 subtype unknown) , 5 acute care facility outbreaks, 31 school outbreaks , and 1 correctional facility outbreak have been reported (Figures 10 and 1 1). By way of comparison, between weeks 40 and 6 of the A(H3N2) dominant 2017 -18 and 201 6-17 seasons, 122 and 161 lab-confirmed LTCF outbreaks, respectively, were reported. Figure 10: Number of influenza -like illness (ILI) outbreaks reported, British Columbia 2018 -19 * School -based ILI outbreak defined as >10% absenteeism on any day, most likely due to ILI. Onset Facility -based influenza outbreaks defined as 2 or more ILI cases within 7 -day period, with at least one laboratory -confirmed case of in fluenza.

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 11 Emerging Respiratory Viruses Cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) - possibly associated with enterovirus D68 (EV -D68) - continue to rise in the US and elsewhere Since September, the US CDC has reported an increa se in paediatric cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a subset of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) (often referred to as \"polio -like illness\" in the media). As of February 1st 2019, the CDC has confirmed 210 cases of AFM across 40 states in 2018 - predominantly affecting children under 5 years of age. A further 164 reports are currently under investigation , 7 of which have been reported in 2019 . Patients have presented with neurological features, specifically single or multi -limb weakness, with mo st requiring hospitalization. More than 90% of AFM cases reported a mild respiratory or febrile illness - consistent with a viral infection - in the weeks preceding symptom onset. AFM has a variety of possible causes, including non -polio enterovirus infect ion. Among 71 confirmed cases tested in 2018 , just over half (54%) tested positive for enterovirus or rhinovirus at the US, the number of confirmed cases ha s surpassed that of their previous high in 2016 (when 149 confirmed cases were detected), and continues to increase. These reports indicate that 2018 represents another biennial peak, similar to that observed during EV -D68 epidemics in 2014 and 2016. The l atter EV -D68 epidemics were noteworthy for including cases with severe respiratory manifestations (less prominently noted in 2018); however, neurological complications were also identified. Accordingly, the US CDC has escalated its response by establishing an AFM task force to aid investigation efforts. An increase in reported cases of AFP has also been detected outside of North America. Public Health England is currently investigating an apparent increase in reports of AFP in England ( 40 cases in 2018 as of January 21st 2019 , compared to an annual expected number of less than 10). The majority of these cases have been children and have arisen since September 2018. Over half of these AFP cases reported acute respiratory tract illness prior to onset of neuro logical symptoms. Non -polio enteroviruses were detected in 15 (38%) cases, with EV-D68 implicated in 9/15 (60%) of these cases. In Canada, a possible uptick in reports of AFP was also noted in 2018; as of January 31st 2019 , 49 confirmed cases have been documented since January 1st 2018, with a further 2 7 cases under investigation. The annual expected number of cases reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada ranges between 27 -51 cases . While EV -D68 has been detected at low levels in BC this 2018 -19 autumn -winter period, we are aware of a single report of laboratory -confirmed EV -D68 infection associated with neurological features. This AFM report (a young child) presented in December 2018 with acute flaccid paralysis of an upper limb following a mild respiratory illness. General information related to AFP/AFM and EV -D68 is available from - flaccid -myelitis.html A summary of the 2014 experience in BC was published in Euro Surveillance, available from: https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560 -7917.ES.2015.20.43.30047 BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 12 National FluWatch (week 5, January 27 to February 2, 2019 ) At the national level, i nfluenza activity has peaked with most indicators showing downward or stable trends in week 5. However, influenza continues to circulate across Canada , with e astern region s reporting higher levels of activity compared to western regions . In week 5 , 20% of laboratory tests were positive for influenza. To date, influenza A is the most common influenza virus detected in Canada (99%); the vast majority of these viruses are A(H1N1)pdm09 (92% of subtyped influenza A viruses) . The majority (86%) of lab -confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 detections have been reported among individuals under the age of 65. Conversely , the majority (62%) of influenza A(H3N2) detections have been reported among adults 65 years of age and older. Detail s are available at: https://www.canada.ca/en/public -health/services/diseases/flu (NML): Strain Characterization From September 1, 2018 , to February 14, 2019 , the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) has characterized 1103 influenza viruses [ 87 A(H3N2), 992 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 24 B (17 Yamagata lineage and 7 Victoria lineage )] received from Canadian laboratories. Influenza A(H3N2): 33 influenza A(H3N2) virus es were considered antigenically similar to A/Singapore/INFIMH - 16-0019/2016, the WHO -recommended A(H3N2) component of the 2018 -19 northern he misphere influenza vaccine . However, 9 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against egg -propagated A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016. 22 influenza A (H3N2) viruses belonged to genetic group 3C.2a1, 7 belonged to genetic group 3C.2a , and 7 belonged to 3C.3a. Sequencing is pending for the remaining isolate. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09: 966 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were found to be similar to the A/Michigan/45/2015 virus : the WHO -recommended influenza A(H1N1) component of the 2018 -19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. However, 26 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against cell culture -propagated A/Michigan/45/2015. Influenza B: 17 influenza B virus es antigenically characterized were considered similar to the B/Phuket/3073/ 2013 virus , which belongs to the B Ya magata lineage : the WHO -recommended influenza B component of the 2018 -19 northern hemisphere quadrivalent influenza vaccine. The WHO -recommended influenza B component of the trivalent vaccine is a B/Colorado/06/2017 -like virus of the B Victoria lineage. Seven influenza B viruses characterized were antigenically similar to B/Colorado/06/2017. National Microbiology Laboratory (NML): Antiviral Resistance From September 1, 2018 , to February 14 , 2019 , the NML received influenza viruses from Canadian laboratories for drug susceptibility testing. Amantadine: Of the 325 influenza A viruses [ 47 A(H3N2) , 278 A(H1N1)pdm09 ] tested against amantadine, all were resistant. Oseltamivir: Of the 730 influenza vir uses [ 61 A(H3N2) , 647 A(H1N1)pdm09 , and 22 B] tested against oseltamivir, 729 were sensitive, and 1 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with a H275Y mutation was resistant. Zanamivir: Of the 729 influenza viruses [ 61 A(H3N2), 646 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 22 B] tested against zanamivir, all were sensitive. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 13 International USA (week 5, January 27 to February 2, 2019 ) Influenza activity increased in the United States (US) in week 5 , with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses continu ing to co -circulate . Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have predominated in most areas of the country ; however , influenza A(H3 N2) viruses have prevailed in the southeastern US. The majority of influenza viruses characterized antigenically and genetically are considered similar to the cell -grown reference viruses of the 2018 -19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. All tested viruses showed susceptibility to zanamivir and greater than 99% of the viruses tested showed susceptibility to oseltamivir and peramivi r. In week 5, the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza was below the system -specific epidemic threshold. Four influenza -associated pediatric deaths were reported. The proportion of outpatient vis its for ILI increased from 3.8% (in wee k 4) to 4 .3% in week 5 , and remains above the national baseline of 2.2 %.The US CDC has posted a summary of influenza activity in the United States and elsewhere, available at: https://www.cdc.gov/flu /weekly/index.htm WHO ( February 4, 2019, based on data up to January 20, 2019 ) In the temperate zone s of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity continued to increase overall . While influenza activity in North America has appeared to decrease slightly, detections in Europe , some countries in Western Asia, East Asia, and Iran have increase d. Influenza levels remained high in Southern Asia. In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels . Worldwide, influenza A has accounted for the majority of detections, with A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pmd09 viruses co- circulating in Europe, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating in North Africa, East Asia, and North America, and influenza A(H3N2) predominating in parts of Southern Asia. From January 7 2019 to Janu ary 20 2019, the WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 232,136 specimens. Of these, 59,457 were positive fo r influenza viruses, of which 58,436 (98.3 %) w ere typed as influenza A and 1021 (1.7%) as influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A viruses, 24,559 (77.7 %) w ere influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 7,058 (22.3%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 85 (34.6%) belonged to the B - Yamagata lineage and 161 (65.4%) to the B -Victoria lin eage.

The Canadian SPSN reported substantial VE of 72% (95% confidence interval (CI): 60 -81%) against medically - attended outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness . Substantial vaccine protection was observed across all age groups, notably young children, who also app eared to be disproportionately affected by this year's A(H1N1)pdm09 - dominant epidemic. The Canadian interim estimate for 2018 -19 is comparable to preliminary estimates of VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 using the same vaccine component reported from Australia (78%; 95%CI: 51 -91%) for their 2018 season. It is substantially higher than reported for Canada during last year's A(H3N2) -dominant epidemic (for which vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2) viruses was less than 20%). Consistent with global trends, sequencing analysis of viruses collected by the Canadian SPSN showed considerable genetic diversity among circulating clade 6B.1 viruses of A(H1N1)pdm09; however, a dominant drift (immunologic escape) variant was not identified. The full report is available as an open -access publication in the online journal Eurosurveillance : https://www.eurosurveillanc e.org/content/10.2807/1560 -7917.ES.2019.24.4.1900055 Hong Kong Early Season Estimate s - 2018/19 Vaccine Effectiveness Against Pediatric Hospitalization On January 31st, 2019, interim VE estimates for the 2018 -19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine were reported from Hong Kong for prevention of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalization in children. Authors report substantial VE of 92% (95% CI: 82-96%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 -attributed hospitalisation in children (aged 6 months -17 years). This estimate is comparable to the VE estimate reported earlier by the Canadian SPSN for the prevention of medically attended outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness in children 1 -8 years of age (91%; 95%CI: 67 -98%). The full report is availab le as an open -access publication in the online journal Eurosurveillance : https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560 -7917.ES.2019.24.5.1900056 United States (U S) Interim Estimates of 2018 -19 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness On February 14th, 2019, mid -season VE estimates for the prevent ion of laboratory -confirmed influenza associated with medically -attended acute respiratory illness (ARI) were reported from the US CDC. Authors report an overall VE of 46% (95%CI: 30 -58%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 which is lower than the recently reported interim VE estimates against A(H1N1)pdm09 of 72% in Canada during the 2018 -19 season and 78% in Australia during the 2018 southern hemisphere influenza season (see above) . A higher VE of 62% (95%CI: 40 -75%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 among those aged 6 months to 17 years was reported in this study . Discrepancies in VE estimates across studies may be attributed to multiple factors including differences in the stage of the influenza epidemic relative to the initiation of the immunization campaign , variation in circulating viruses , as well as methodological differences including contri buting sample size s (and statistical power) , participant profiles and clinical outcomes assessed . In general to date, however, networks are reporting substantial vaccine protection in mid -season analyses that will be re -assessed end -of-season.
