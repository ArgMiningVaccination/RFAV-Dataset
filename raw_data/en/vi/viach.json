The pharmaceutical sector is highly fragmented, with over 5000 domestic manufacturers in operation. Decision making is also highly fragmented, wi th provinces assuming regulatory and funding authority under a broader na tional framework. Significant variation in out-of-pocket payments and access to medicines is seen both across provinces and between urban and rural areas within China. Current challen ges within the Chinese pharmaceutical sector include poor drug quality, w eak protection of intellectual property, high levels of inappropriate prescribing, delayed access to innovative medicines and high out -of-pocket payments. Over the past ten years, the re have been a number of significant reforms within the Chinese pharmaceu tical sector. Among other policy reforms, China has extended healthcare coverage to over 99% of the population, established an essential medicines list, implemented a zero mark - up pol icy in all primary care facilities and public hospitals, and has deregula ted the pricing of off - patent medicines in order to bridge the gap between originator and generic products. Recently, China announced their 13th Five Year plan which outlines six major tasks for the Chinese pharmaceutical sector: 1) Building a scientific an d rational tiered medical service system 2) Implementing a scientific and effective modern hospital management system 3) Improving the efficiency of th e universal basic medical insurance system 4) Streamlining the drug supply security system, that ensures full inve ntory and prioritizes use of essential medicines. 5) Establishing a stringent and streamlined regulatory system. 6) Carrying out reforms relevant to hu man resource capacity building and training, medical provision funding, and public health service infrastructur e building. As China continues to face fiscal challenges from an aging population and increases in non - communicable diseases, promoting efficie ncy within the pharmaceutical sector will become increasingly important. With the overall aim of establishing a n overarching national pharmaceutical framework to help guide policy reform this report has 3 -key objectives: 1) To undertake a mapping of the key t rends and policy directions in China's health and pharmaceutical policy and benchmark these with similar trends from an international perspective; 2) To identify and propose several validated policy areas in China's health and pharmaceutical policy environme nt that merit in -depth research and analysis; and 3) To combine the above two objectives by highlighting the key i nternational policy trends from which China could benefit In order to map the key trends and policy directions in China's pharmaceutical system, an analytical framework was developed outlining the relationship between system - and micro -level policies and t heir role in promoting pharmaceutical policy objectives. Collectively, national pharmaceutical policy aims to promote several key objectives: acc ess to medicines, quality of medicines, efficiency in resource allocation, and rational use of medicines, while maintaining a Pharmaceutical Policy in China 6 budgetary constraint (macroeconomic efficiency). At the system level, key functions include: 1) gatekeeping through regulatory age ncies and 2) budget setting through control of overall pharmaceutical expenditure. System level policies are cr itical for ensuring safety and efficacy of medicines entering the pharmaceutical system and for controlling macroeconomic efficiency to ensure th e health system as a whole is sustainable. Micro -level policies can be broadly divided into supply -side policie s, including pricing, reimbursement and procurement and demand -side policies that target either prescribers or patients including formularies, cl inical guidelines, and cost sharing. Mapping of pharmaceutical policy and trends requires consideration of not only the direct impact of a policy on pharmaceutical policy objectives, but also on the relationship between system and micro -level policies in p romoting those objectives. This report relies on both secondary and primary data. An extensive literature revi ew was performed via PubMed, Web of Science, and EconLit to identify peer -review literature assessing the impact of demand and supply side polici es on one of the following research endpoints: access to medicines, quality of medicines , rational use of medic ines, macroeconomic efficiency, or microeconomic efficiency. Peer review literature was supplemented with grey literature was retrieved from national and state level sources, social health insurance and private health insurance reports, and primary health care and hospital care reports. Primary data was collected through semi -structured interviews with experts and key opinion leaders in health pharmaceutical policy in China. Interviews were performed with the aim of corroborating and updating evidence from secondary data sources, to reveal major gaps in pharmaceutical policy, to offer ins ights on possible ways to address these gaps and to establish a list of policy initiatives moving forward. A total of 151 articles/reports were included in the comprehensiv e literature review, fifty -two English sources and ninety -eight Chinese sources. A total of 13 semi-structured interviews were performed, included 8 leading academics in Chinese health and pharmaceutical policy, 1 person in a health policy -making position at a municipal government, 1 person in a pharmacy director position from a major ho spital, 1 person in a marketing director position from a major pharmaceutical company, 1 person in a manager position at a hospital -based research centre, and 1 person in a regional director position at a health -promotion foundation. In addition, insights were also drawn upon through short and informal exchanges with 10 participants at a high-profile conference hosted by a top university in China . On the supply -side, trends and policy reforms were discussed relating to drug innovation, drug approval, drug pricing, drug procurement, and health technolo gy assessment. On the demand - side, trends and policy reforms were discussed relating to formularies, drug distribution, prospec tive payment models, generic subs titution, clinical guidelines, disease specific initiatives, cost-sharing, and patient education. Despite being the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world, China lags behind other countries in terms of drug innov ation. Weak intellectual property protection and slow drug approval are key barriers to promotion of research and development. Relative to other regulatory agencies globally, China employs low number of technical reviews and has high median time for approv al. Within the 13th FYP, China ha s indicated a priority will be to accelerate innovation and access to new drugs in the areas of oncology, major infectious diseases, nervous system and mental diseases, chronic disease, and orphan diseases. Monoclonal Antib odies (mAb) , protein and peptide based biotech drugs, therapeutic vaccines, and biotherapeutics based on RNA, SELEX and CAR -T technologies are likely to be prioritised for accelerated access . Further, the State Council hopes to encourage local research and development by offering accelera ted regulatory approval for domestically produced products. The national medical products administration (formally the CFDA) is the regulatory agency for drug safety. Historically, NMPA standard for drug approval and regula tion have been weak, leading to m istrust over domestically produced medicines. In 2016, China overhauled its equivalence testing process for generic medicines, by making regulations more closely aligned Pharmaceutical Policy in China 7 with international standards. This reform requires al l products approved prior to Octo ber 2007 to renew their license with a comparative study prior to 2018. A secondary aim of the reform was to clear all drug application backlogs. Despite stringent deadlines, the process was slower than intended. By April 2 019 only 239 drugs out of the 685 listed on the Essential Medicines List had passed bio -equivalence tests. Beyond reforming generic drug approval, the NMPA has also introduced a priority review process to streamline approval innovative drugs for HIV/AIDS, cancer, major chronic diseases, o rphan disease and for products with high potential economic impact . Further a new conditional approval process will provide early approval for products indicated for serious, life threatening conditions or for serious unmet medical needs on the basis of early or mid -stage clinical data. All products on reimbursed drug lists within China, including generic products, off -patent originator products and in -patent medicines, are subject to pricing regulation at national and provincial level. The primary mechan ism for pricing off -patent and generic medicines on the national reimbursed drugs list is provincial tendering. Provinces issue tenders for to manufacturers for the right supply a drug to healthcare facilities. The winning bid represents the reimbursement price for a product within that province. Historically, many provinces employed separate tenders for off -patent originator products and generic products, under the assumption that generic products were of lower products. Or iginator products were granted pr eferential pricing and maintained a price monopoly over generic products. Recently the State council reformed the provincial tendering process requiring that tenders are issued by molecule name, eliminating the possibility for preferential pricing. In -patent products are priced through direct negotiation at either national or provincial level although this process has not been formalized. Historically, new products had to wait upwards of 3 to 4 years for revisions to the NRD L before being eligible for reimb ursement. A recent negotiations pilot at national level reached agreement on price for 36 out 44 products and these were subsequently added to the NRDL. However the process remains opaque and requires formalization. While p rogress has been made, China stil l requires a systematic approach to pricing and reimbursement of expensive and innovative medicines. Provincial tendering sets the reimbursement price of medicines but is currently not directly linked to procurement. Hospit als procure products directly fro m manufacturers and wholesalers and often engage in secondary negotiation to obtain additional rebates. Meanwhile, provinces procure products directly from manufacturers for primary care facilities. While secondary negotiat ion lowers the effective cost of a medicine and provides hospitals with more revenue, concerns emerge that this creates distorted incentives overprescribe medicines with higher rebates. However the extent to which secondary negotiation contributes to inapp ropriate prescribing remains uncl ear. Recent pilots have explored joint procurement of medicines through cross-province/cross -municipality group purchasing organizations in order to achieve lower prices. One possible way forward is to issue tenders with a fixed commitment of procurement quantities in order to eliminate the possibility of secondary negotiations. In October 2018, China established the National Pharmaceutical and Health Technology Assessment center. Currently, HTA is not formally utilized for decision making on the pricing a nd reimbursement of pharmaceutical products in China. Uses of HTA have been predominantly academic. The negotiation pilot in 2016 represented the first instance of dossier submission for the pricing and reimbursement of med icines, however no formal guideli nes were available on evidence requirements, assessment criteria, and assessment timelines. Nevertheless, the establishment of national pharmaceutical and HTA center represent the first steps towards integrating HTA with de cision making in China. The key c hallenge is to establish clear and specific pathways to include HTA as part of the policy -making process. Following marketing authorization, products can be listed on two national formularies, the national reimbursed drug l ist (NRDL) or the Emergency Medic ines List (EML). Provinces are able to modify the NRDL by up to 15% in order to establish their own provincial reimbursed drug lists (PRDL). Until recently, the NRDL was only updated every 3 to 4 years, and new drugs often had Pharmaceutical Policy in China 8 to wait until a revision peri od to be added. Following the negotiation pilot, future adjustments to the list are likely to be more frequent and dynamic, although cost -containment will remain a long-term focal point for pharmaceutical policy. Advancemen ts in gene -based therapies and ce ll technologies will pose significant challenges from a financing perspective. The essential medicines list (EML) was established as part of the 2009 health system reforms in an effort to achieve universal coverage in China . Drugs on the EML are fully reim bursed for all patients in China, and a zero mark -up policy is present to prevent hospital mark -ups. Historically, hospitals in China received significant parts of their revenue from drug sales and applied mark -ups of up to 15% on all pharmaceuticals. This contributed to China's high levels of inappropriate prescribing as hospitals overprescribed medicines in order to maximize revenue. The Essential Medicines List and zero mark -up policy resulted in significant reductions in inappropriate prescribing, and i mproved availability of essential medicines in primary health facilities. However, hospitals began to rely more heavily on other healthcare services to compensate for lost revenue and drug shortages of emergency medicines r emains an issue. Historically, the drug distribution and supply chain in China was extremely fragmented, with several layers of wholesalers applying mark -ups along the supply chain. This contributed to the relatively high price of medicines within China. In 2016, a \"dual -invoice\" policy was launched, limiting the number of distributors in the supply chain between manufacturer and hospital to one. Further, both the manufacturer and distributor are required to provide invoices reporting sale-prices. However , expert interviews suggest that this policy may do little to lower drug prices on its own. It does not address the fundamental issue that hospitals have an economic incentive to profit from drug sales, thus many demand under -the-table rebates for allowing drugs to enter the hospital . Currently, health care facilities across China are reimbursed retrospectively for the services they provide, in what is typically referred to as a fee -for-service payment model. Insufficient government funding, has led medical departments to set specific r evenue targets, thereby incentivizing doctors to overprovide health services . China has explored the use of prospective payment models such as capitation, global budget, or salary models in a number of pilot studies. By decoup ling physician income from the services they provide, prospective payment systems discourage overprescribing. In general PPS systems successfully reduced expensive and unnecessary prescriptions. However, some evidence emerges of cost -shifting from low to h igh level services, suggesting that some physicians may be passing on expensive patients to higher level services. As part of the 2017 healthcare reform policy, the state council announced intentions to reform the basic medical insurance payment model to a prospective system however th e timeline to implementation remains unclear. Differences in the way health care providers code diagnoses and in the electronic health record systems implemented across healthcare facilities pose a barrier to the introduction of a universal prospective pay ment system. China has had generic substitution policy in place since 2007, however there has been very little enforcement of the policy, likely due to issues in trust over the quality of generic medicines. While physicians ar e required to prescribe by Int ernational Nonproprietary Name (INN) they typically indicate the desired brand name as well. Studies show that generic utilization is as low as 20 -34% in some disease areas, resulting in a substantial loss of potential savings . While improvements in bioequ ivalence testing will help to improve the quality of domestically produced products, more targeted efforts will likely be needed to overcome public mistrust of generics. Historically, the use of clinical guidelines in China ha s been highly variable. China is unique in its use of both Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicines. Guidelines must be able to help provider employ evidence based decision making across both types of medicines. The quality of Chinese guidelines is typically lower than those from other developed countries, with significantly fewer overall citations and fewer Cochrane review citations. Feedback from interviewees suggest many of these guidelines are based on consensus and lack scientific rigour. Adh erence to guidelines generally is much lower among low -tier healthcare providers due to lack of awareness . Improvements in the quality and implementation of clinical guidelines in China will require a Pharmaceutical Policy in China 9 coordinated and systematic approach. National standards should be established for gui deline methodology, quality, and implementation in order to promote effective dissemination and adherence. China has been successful in employing targeted disease specific initiatives to reducing inappropriate prescribing. Pri or to 2010, percentage of pres criptions with antibiotic prescribed and levels of antibiotic polypharmacy were well above WHO recommended levels. In 2011, The Chinese government implemented a National Action Plan for Antibiotic Stewardship. Under the action plan, antibiotics were catego rized and usage of controlled antibiotics was restricted to higher level hospitals. Chief administrators of hospitals were made accountable for patient outcomes and efficiency surrounding antibiotic use with penalties employed in cases of inappropriate pre scribing. The plan was associated with significant reductions in total costs and volume of antibiotic use. Other targeted initiatives have taken poverty alleviation into consideration in an attempt to remove barriers in access to care and promote better di sease management in patients with chronic conditions. In the year 2000, only 15% of the population in China was covered under health insurance, and for most, utilisation of health services was often associated with catastroph ic expenditure . As part of the 2009 healthcare reforms, the Chinese government committed an additional USD 124 billion in public spending over three years in order to expand population coverage, through one of the three main health insurance schemes, with the aim of covering 90% of pre miums for poor families and 70% of premiums in wealthier coastal regions. Further, complimentary medical assistance programmes were established to cover the remaining out -of-pocket fees for particularly poor families . Expansio ns in coverage resulted in sig nificant increases in the use of healthcare, particularly in in poor families. Despite increases in utilization, out -of-pocket payments remain high, as patients in the NCMS or URBMI still paid upwards of 50% of their costs for outpatient and inpatient ser vices due to reimbursement ceilings. One of the key contributing factors to irrational use of medicines in China is patient health literacy, particularly surrounding the use of antibiotics, injectable, and generic products Prevailing attitudes around these products are that antibiotics are a cure -all, that injectable have improved efficacy over orally administered drugs, and that generic products, particularly low -priced generic products, are inferior to branded medicines. While physicians are often in a pos ition to prescribe appropriately, patient demand often i nfluences prescribing behavior. Targeted health literacy programmes and patient education programmes are needed to overcome issues in inappropriate antibiotic use and the inefficiencies caused by poor generic utilization. Beyond improving appropriate prescribing, patient education can also play a critical role in management of chronic diseases by improving patient self -care and reducing acute exacerbations of disease. Overall, China has made substanti al progress in improving its health system in a short period of time; most notably, it has achieved near -universal coverage of health insurance, it has established the EML and it has lowered prices for these drugs . Nonetheless , many challenges still exist in the Chinese pharmaceutical sector, from R&D, to manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of drugs on the supply side, and irrational prescription and use on the demand side. Based on the present review, current priority areas for reform include HTA a nd negotiations, pharmaceutical pricing, generic policy, healthcare provider payment models and healthcare financing and primary care. First, as China faces growing fiscal pressure from an aging population and increases in n on- communicable diseases, the use of health technology assessment is likely to play a critical role in the promotion of rational use of medicines. To this end, the piloted negotiation process requires formalization through legislation with clarity on submi ssion processes and requiremen ts, product eligibility, types of evidence considered, and evaluation processes and timelines . Second, W hile the goal may ultimately be to move towards an evidence -based system with HTA Pharmaceutical Policy in China 10 and pricing negotiations for innovative and expensive products, extern al reference pricing can provide a reasonable stop -gap until capacity in this area is built. Improvements are also needed in the pricing system for originator and generic products which are largely undermined by poor utilizati on of generic products. Switch ing from a fixed percentage reimbursement rate model to a tiered -co-payment model with full reimbursement for generics (set based on internal reference pricing), will likely help to alleviate some of these issues . Third, despi te recent reforms in regulatory approval of generic medicines, the process has been time -intensive and opaque. More resources are required to strengthen the review team, and improved coordination with regulatory authorities is needed . Improvi ng local gener ic quality will not only improve utilization domestically, but will also provide greater opportunities in international markets. Fourth, despite implementation of the zero mark -up policy, rates of over -prescribing and inappropriate prescribin g, particularl y in the context of antibiotics and injections, remain high relative to WHO recommendations for low and middle income countries. Distorted financial incentives from a retrospective payment model plays a key role in inappropriate prescribing. Greater implem entation of prospective payment systems throughout China may help to further reduce irrational prescribing , however careful monitoring is needed to ensure quality of services does not decline. Finally, problems persist in funding healthcare f ollowing the 2 009 health reforms. Removal of income from mark -ups has not been adequately replaced through government subsidies. Increases in government subsidies and financing and strengthening of the weak rural healthcare system will also be required to address shorta ges in physician income structure. Boosting the primary care quality, particularly through training workforce and attracting talent to primary care institutions, will gradually change patients' perception of poor care quality associated with these healthca re facilities and encourage them to utilize community healthcare resources more efficiently.

Introduction This report provides an assessment of the current challenges and opportunities facing the Chinese pharmaceutical sector . The Chinese pharmaceutical market is the second largest in the world, beh ind only the United States. China routinely spends nearly 40% of their health expenditure on pharmaceuticals, which is substantially higher than the OECD average of 19%. The Chinese pharmaceutical sector is highly fragmented with over 5000 domestic manufac turers in operation. The top 5 pha rmaceutical manufacturers within China account for less than 15% of the market, a value far below what is typically seen in developed countries (Mossialos et al. 2016) . Pharmaceutical regulatory authority is also highly fr agmented within China, as province s are given authority to establish their own provincial reimbursed drugs list according to the national formulary and are responsible for drug pricing through provincial tenders. As result, significant variation is seen ac ross provinces in terms of out -of-pocket payments and patient access to medicines (Huang et al. 2018). There have been a number of significant pharmaceutical sector reforms in the past ten years following the pivotal 2009 heath care reforms. Over the past decade, and among other policy reforms, China has extended healthcare coverage to over 99% of the population, established an essential medicines list, implemented a zero mark -up policy in all primary care facilities and public hospitals, and has deregulate d the pricing of off -patent medici nes in order to bridge the gap between originator and generic products. Further, China has also reformed their regulatory system, by bringing bioequivalence requirements c lose to international standards and through introduction of an expedited approval pat hway (Sun et al. 2018) . Currently, China is midway through their 13th Five Year Plan for Healthcare reform (2016 -2020). The 13th Five Year Plan aims to promote fair access to basic medical services, to imp rove primary healthcare infrastructure, and to coo rdinate healthcare form of medical services, health insurance and the pharmaceutical sector (Multiple Ministries 2016 ). In pursuit of these goals, the plan outlines six major tasks: 1) Building a scientific an d rational tiered medical service system 2) Implement ing a scientific and effective modern hospital management system 3) Improving the efficiency of the universal basic medical insurance system 4) Streamlining the drug supply security system, that ensures full inve ntory and prioritizes use of essential medicines. 5) Establishing a stringent and streamlined regulatory system. 6) Carrying out reforms relevant to human resource capacity building and training, medical provision funding, and public health service infrastructure building. Despite recent reforms, a number of outstanding issues remain within the Chinese pharmaceutical sector including poor drug quality, high levels of inappropriate prescribing, and high out -of-pocket payments for medicines. Further, n ew medicines have often face d substantial delays in re gulator y approval due to application backlog and must often wait ye ars for inclusion on the national reimbursed drug list, which historically has only been reviewed every 4 to 5 years (Mossialos et al. 2016, Sun et al. 2018) . Pharmaceutical Policy in China 13 Moving forward, an aging population and increase in the incidence of non -communicable disease will put increasing fiscal pressure on the Chinese healthcare system. Promoting efficiency within the pharmaceutical sector will undoubtedly become increasingly important as China continues to striv e for equal access to effective medicines. Effective pharmac eutical reform will require concerted action across all stakeholders, including government, providers, patients and industry. An overarching national pharmaceutical framework could be very helpful in achieving coordinated reform. With an overall aim of establishing an overarching national pharmaceutical framework, from both a supply - and demand -side, this report has 3 key objectives: 1) To undertake a mapping of the key trends and policy directions i n China's health and pharmaceutica l policy and benchmark these with similar trends from an international perspective; 2) To identify and propose several validated policy areas in China's health and pharmaceutical policy environment that merit in -depth resear ch and analysis; and 3) To combine th e above two objectives by highlighting the key international policy trends from which China could benefit. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 14 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Analytical Framework In order to map the key trends and policy directions in C hina's pharmaceutical system, an analytical framework was developed outlining the relationship between system - and micro -level policies. Collectively, national pharmaceutical policy aims at promoting several key objecti ves: access to medicines, quality of medicines, improving efficiency in resource allocation and rational use of medicines, whilst observing a budgetary constraint (macroeconomic efficiency). Access to medicines refers to the promotion of equitable access t o a wide -range of essential medicines . Access is typically considered in terms of both affordability (e.g. levels of co -payments) and in terms of availability (e.g. inclusion on formularies). Beyond access, national pharmaceutical policy aims to ensure tha t medicines are safe, efficacious and produced with high quality. Finally, rational use of medicines aims to ensure efficient use of pharmaceutical resources and appropriate use of medicines (e.g. avoiding unnecessary and potentially harmful prescriptions) . Improving efficiency in resource al location is also an important policy goal and relates to the issue of value assessment for new medicines (and their use) as well as the likely trade-offs between using branded and generic medicines, where the latter exist. At the system level, regulatory a gencies serve as a gatekeeper to the pharmaceutical market, with important implications for both access to and quality of medicines. Through regulatory review and bioequivalence testing, standards are placed to ensure the efficacy and safety of medicines, prior to routine use within the pharmaceutical system. As a gatekeeper, regulatory agencies also dictate the timeliness of access to new medicines. Sever al regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) , employ Early Access to Medicines Schemes (EAMS) to accelerate the review time or development time for medicines that address an unmet medical nee d. Effective regulatory policy must balance the need to ensure quality of medicines with timely access. System level pharmaceutical policy may also determine the total levels of pharmaceutical expenditure. While cost -containment is not a key pharmaceutica l policy objective in its own right, it can play a key role in the macroeconomic efficiency of the heal th system as a whole. Unsustainable growth in pharmaceutical expenditure may divert resources away from other health system inputs, such as hospitals and doctors, to the detriment of patients who rely on these services. Many health systems apply budget cap s to ensure that pharmaceutical expenditure is both sustainable and predictable. Pharmaceutical expenditure can be further controlled through micro -level policies that target either the price or volume of pharmaceuticals prescribed, including tendering, re ference pricing, price cuts, financial incentives, generic substitution and use of co -payments. Broadly -speaking these policies can be divided into suppl y- and demand -side policies. Supply -side policies relate to the pricing, reimbursement and procurement of pharmaceuticals. Demand -side policies are further divided into (a) proxy - demand policies, which target prescribers through promoti ng appropriate presc ribing, and the distribution chain, relating to the dispensing of medicines and the incentives that sha pe behaviour; and (b) demand policies, which target patients with the aim of encouraging appropriate use, including cost -sharing as a tool to shape behav iour. Overall, mapping of pharmaceutical policy and trends requires careful consideration of the relationship between macro - and micro -level policies and of their role in promoting key pharmaceutical policy ob jectives. Assessment of both macro - and micro -level pharmaceutical policies aims to identify outstanding gaps and areas for future reform. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 15 Figure 1.

Primary data collection The second stage of data collection involved obtaining primary data based on fieldwork in China. A series of semi-structured intervi ews were performed with stakeholders, experts and key opinion leaders (KOLs) in health and pharmaceutical policy in China, i ncluding leading academics on health and pharmaceutical policy, policy advisors in government think tanks , and stakeholders in leadi ng hospitals and pharmaceutical companies . The purpose of the primary data collection was four fold. First, to corroborate and update existing evidence from the secondary data sources . Second, to reveal the major gaps in pharmaceutical policy and challenge s for further reforms , as perceived by various stakeholders at different levels. To this end, interv iewees were asked to provide evidence on key trends and priorities in Chinese health and pharmaceutical policy, including how international trends vs. carvi ng its own pathway are likely to shape and impact future directions in Chinese pharmaceutical policy . Third to offer insights on ways to address these priorities in a sustainable manner. F inally , to establish a validated list of research activities and pol icy initiative s capable of address ing gaps in health and pharmaceutical policy in China. The interv iews were conducted in a semi -structured fashion. The questions broadly fall into five areas of pharmaceutical policy: drug approval, drug pricing and reimb ursement, hospital management, primary health care, and health insurance. A questionnaire was constr ucted addressing recent policy initiatives, trends, gaps and challenges for future reform in these five domains. The questionnaire is found in Appendix A. Various combinations of questions were used according to the stakeholder's area of expertise . For ins tance, drug approval stakeholders were asked in -depth questions related to recent development in drug approval and major gaps in current standards, and rela ted questions on drug pricing and reimbursement and health insurance, but not issues related to hosp ital management or primary health care. 2.5. Summary of Interviews Performed Primary data collection involved in -depth face -to-face formal interviews with 13 sta keholders from different backgrounds, each lasting 1 -2 hours. Interviewees included 8 leading academics in Chinese health and pharmaceutical policy, 1 person in a health policy -making position at a municipal government, 1 person in a pharmacy director posi tion from a major hospital, 1 person in a marketing director position from a major pharmaceuti cal company, 1 person in a manager position at a hospital -based research centre, and 1 person in a regional director position at a health -promotion foundation. In addition, insights were also drawn upon through short and informal exchanges with 10 particip ants at a high -profile conference hosted by a top university in China. These 10 conference participants included 5 people formerly or currently in government heal th policy positions at central, provincial, and peprfectual levels, and 5 academic experts in health and pharmaceutical policy. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 19 3. Health System Governance and Pharmaceutical Regulatory Structure Governance of the health system is led by the State Council , China's chief administrative authority, and responsibilities are delegated to several government ministries (IMS 2015; Mossialos et al. 2016; J. hwan Wang, Chen, and Tsai 2012; Z ou et al. 2016) . Figure 3 outlines the key government bodies within the healthcare sector and their respective functions. Figure 3 Governance in the Chinese Healthcare System On a horizontal dimension at the national level, the key government bodies inv olved in pharmaceutical policy are: National Health Commission (NHC): The NHC is China's main executive agency for its health system. It was established in March 2018, replacing the dismantled National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC). Its mai n functions include formulating nati onal health policies, coordinating and advancing healthcare reforms, overseeing disease prevention and treatment, ensuring the accessibility of health services, and monitoring the quality of health services. Its responsi bilities directly related to pharmac eutical policies involve establishing national pharmaceutical policies and maintaining the national essential medicine list (EML). National Medical Products Administration (NMPA): NMPA is the regulatory agency for drug safety. It replaced the predecessor o rganisation - China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) - in April 2018 , as part of a national government restructure. CFDA was a stand - alone ministry -level agency directly led by the State Council, but now NMPA has become a sub -ministerial level subsidiary of a newly formed State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) which subsumes the responsibilities previously held by several bod ies and oversees all manner of market controls. NMPA is responsible for overseeing d rug State Council National Health Commission (NHC) National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) State Medical Insurance Administration (SMIA) Ministry of Finance China National Intellectual Property Administration Ministry of Commerce Formulates national health policy and reform Regulates drug registration, oversees drug safety and established drug quality standards Determines benefit package for public health insurance Registers patents for intellectual property Sets overall healthcare budget Provides anti - monopoly and anti- protectionism functions Regulatory agency Main executive agency for health Health insurance agency Ministry of Industry and Inform ation Technology Regulates industrial policy Patent Office Pharmaceutical Policy in China 20 safety, ranging from formulating standards for medicine management, regulating drug registration, establishing quality standards, to drug quality supervision and inspec tions. State Medical Insurance Administration (SMIA): SMIA is responsible for formul ating policies, plans, and standards on medical insurance, maternity insurance, and medical assistance, and ensuring their implementation. It was set up in 2018, taking ove r the health insurance responsibilities from the Ministry of Human Resources and Soc ial Security (MHRSS) which oversaw the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) and Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI), and NHFPC which oversaw the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS). In relevance to pharmaceutical policy, it is responsible for pharmaceutical pricing regulation, which prior to 2018 fell under the jurisdiction of National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). It regulates the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), health insurance payout standards, and tende ring policies. Several other government bodies provide support functions to the health system, including the Ministry of Finance , which drafts overall budgets and manages n ational government subsidies, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (M IIT), which makes industry policies, the Ministry of Commerce (MoC) , which provides anti -monopoly and anti -protectionism functions , and the China National Intellectual Prop erty Administration (CNIPA), which is the patent office in China . On a vertical dime nsion of the governance structure, provincial agents also exert considerable influence on the making and implementation of pharmaceutical policies (Mossialos e t al. 2016) . Table 2 briefly summarizes the regulatory responsibilities at national and provincial levels for various pharmaceutical activities, from registration, to pri cing, reimbursement, prescribing, distribution, and cost -sharing. For instance, whil e the SMIA maintains the NRDL, provinces have significant discretion in supplementing the list and deciding on the co -payments based on their needs and resources, leading t o vast differences across provinces. Similarly, while SMIA provides national guidanc e for tendering and procurement, implementation is drastically different across provinces. Local protectionism is a major issue in a fragmented market where each province does its own tendering individually (Zou et al. 2016) .

Recent t rends and Reforms in Supply -side Policies 4.1. Intellectual Property and Drug Innovation China is the world's second largest pharmaceutical market, after the US. Its total sales amounted to $115 billion in 2015 (IMS 2015) . This market is dominate d by generic drugs with 95% of the approved biochemical drugs in China being generics. Investment in R&D is much lower compared to international standards, at less than 5% of total revenues (J. hwan Wang, Chen, and Tsai 2012) . Between 2010 and 2016, the R&D intensity (R&D spending as proportion of revenue) of large- and medium -size pharmaceutical manufacturers has increased from 1.79% to 1.91% (Table 3). Despite being the 2nd largest pharmaceutical market globally, China lags behind other countries in terms of drug innovat ion. Weak intellectual property (IP) protection is a major barrier to new drug development. China is st ill developing its intellectual property laws. China's patent law, enacted in 1985, specifically excluded pharmaceuticals at the beginning in an attempt to prevent monopolies in the pharmaceutical market. Patenting of compositions of matter was not allowed until 1993. Even where patent laws are in place, enforcement of patent protection can be difficult. Pfizer's Viagra was met with an 11 -year legal battle over patent and trademark infringement with Chinese generic manufacturers. Weak IP protection has led pharmaceutical manufacturers to seek competitive advantage from administrative protection or market entry barriers instead of innovation. On the other hand, unlike India, to date China has not exercised compulsory licensing of patented drugs. Table 3. Pharmaceutical industry revenue and R&D spending (2010 -2016) Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Gross Industrial Revenue in billion RMB (in billion 63.65 66.11 % 66.85 % Revenue by LMM in billion RMB (in billion * LMM: Large - and mediu m-size manufacturers. Historically, l ow levels of drug innovation are also caused by the weak regulatory system of pharmaceutical products and the redundant application of generic drugs without technical innovation. The pharmaceutical industry in China is considered highly fragmented with weak research and development and low pr oduct heterogeneity (Ni et al. 2017) . For instance, drug approval often occurs after a change in name or a slight modification in formulatio n to avoid price ceilings or cuts. There is also a current backlog in new dru g approvals as well as a three to Pharmaceutical Policy in China 23 four-year time lag between drug registration in Europe and in China, due to the requirement of clinical trials by foreign pharmaceutical countrie s prior to their product launches (Ni et al. 2017) .. At its peak there was a backlog of 22,000 applications in 2015, which had been gradually lowered since, but there still was a significant number of 4,000 in 2017 (CFDA 2018) . A number of historical reasons led to the backlogs, including a large number of duplicate generic applications (Mossialos et al. 2016) , inaction of the auth ority, an opaque approval process, lack of well - defined guidelines, and an ineffective signaling channel. Relative to other regulator y agencies globally, China has long standard review timelines and median times for approval (Table 4) . Relatively low level s of funding and low number of technical reviewers are likely to be contributing factors (Jain et al. 2017) . NMPA in recent years had taken several measures to address the backlog issues, by increasing inspection resources, relaxing rules requiring perform ing clinical trials within China, clarifying and streamlining the approval process and bringing it in line with international standar ds and guidelines . Table 4 - Budgets, product approvals, timelines, and fees of various regulatory authorities for new phar maceutical products. (Source: Jain et al. 2017) Fundamentally, the pharmaceutical industry within China will likely need to beco me less fragmented in order to meet new regulatory standards. With over 5,000 different drug manufacturers and the top 5 hol ding less than 15% of market share, many companies are unlikely to abide to Good Manufacturing Practices essential for drug quality and safety (Mossialos et al. 2016) . Within the 13th FYP the state council has declared it will support mergers and Pharmaceutical Policy in China 24 acquisitions (M&A) of domestic manufactures with the aim of consolidating and concentrating the pharmaceutical industry (Multiple Ministries 2016) . The 13th FYP outlined several priorities for innovation and industrialisation of new drugs. Specifically, the plan proposes accelerated innovation and access to new drugs in areas of oncology, major infectious disease s, nervous system and mental disease s, chronic disease s, and orphan disease s. Specifically, monoclonal Antibodies (mAb) , protein and peptide based biotech drugs, therapeutic vaccines, a nd biotherapeutics based on RNA, SELEX and CAR -T technologies should be prioritised for accelerated access. The 13th FYP also aims to improve the quality of traditional Chinese medicines ( TCMs ), through strengthened quality tracking from herbal origins and through new development of TCMs that address high clinical need. Further, the 13th FYP aims to further advance generi c equivalence testing and to promote the development and use of biosimilar in China. Finally, the 13th FYP aims to improve the use of pers onalized medicine based on genomic data. Overall, the plan stipulates that between 2016 and 2020, economic growth will be driven by increased use of TCM, healthcare services, wearable health devices and genetic screening (Multiple Ministries 2016) . In terms of drug approval, the State Council hopes to incentivize greater use of domestically produced generics and innovative drugs and to reduce reliance on imported products. In order to achieve these goals, the 13th FYP proposes strategic measures including the introduction of Good Clinical Practice international standards, the implementation of explicit clinical ev aluation platforms stratified by type of new drug, an increase in the capacity of drug review teams, and the optimisation of prioritisation and fast track schemes for new drug approval. In alignment with the State Council , the CFDA (now NMPA) introduced a number of reforms in the past three years, such as expediting approval for innovative drugs, introducing Bolar exception into law, and accepting overseas clinical trial data. Given the short period of time since the reforms, the impact of these policies o n encouraging innovation remains to be seen . Key messages and remaining gaps Weak intellectual property protection and slow drug approval processes in China have contributed to low levels of local research and development. Relative to oth er regulatory authorities, the NMPA has a low number of technical reviewers and long median review times for new drugs. As part of the 13th FYP, China lists several priorities for improvements in the innovation and industrialisation of new drugs. Specific focus is pla ce on incentivizing greater use of domestically produced drugs. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 25 4.2. Drug Approval In 2016, the Chinese government issued the Pharmaceutical Industry Development Planning Guidelines, which outlined China's strategy for strengthening the pharmaceutical system between 2016 and 2020. One of the core development tasks in the planning guideli nes was to improve product quality and safety (Multiple Ministries 2016) . Historically, NMPA standards regarding drug approval and regulation have been weak, leading to mistrust over quality of domestically produced medicines. For instance, recent repor ts found that over 80% of clinical trial data submitted for drug registration were either fabricated, flawed or contained inadequate data (Woodhead 2016) . Over the p ast decade, a number of reforms have been introduced with the aim of raising the standards for drug approval and improving drug quality. Table 5 outlines the current drug approval process es within China. Table 5 - NMPA Drug Approval Processes Source: ( Adapted from Wang and Davidson 2017) NMPA Approv al processes Type of Product Evidence Requirements Additional notes New Drug New product without overseas authorisation Local Phase I, II, and III trials Monitoring period of 5 years Modified innovative product without overseas authorisation (e.g. new formulation/new indication) Local Phase I, II, and III trials Monitoring period of 3 -4 years Imported Drug New product approved and manufactured outside China Local pharmacokinetic and phase III trial N/A Generic product approved and manufactured outside China Local Bioequivalence study N/A Generic Drug Locally manufactured generic product with approval only outside China Pharmacokinetics and Phase III trial N/A Locally manufactured generic product already approved in China Bioequivalence study N/A Priority Review Innovative products not approved overseas, innovative products with plans for local manufacturing or global clinical trials in China, innovative drugs for HIV/AIDs, viral hepatitis, rare diseases, malignant tumours or paediatric indications Local Phase I, II, and III trials Additional consultation with Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE). Targeted review time of six months Newly launched generic products Bioequivalence study Additional consultation with Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE). Targete d review time of six months Conditional Approval Products indicated for serious life - threatening conditions or for significant unmet medical needs Early or mid -stage clinical data Defined risk management plan required and completion of clinical trials Orphan drugs Trials with fewer trial subject numbers Completion of clinical trials Pharmaceutical Policy in China 26 4.2.1. Issues in Drug Quality China is the second largest producer of counterfeit or substandard drugs worldwide (Pan et al. 2016) . A series of scandals involving unsafe or impotent vaccines in recen t years have prompted serious concerns about drug safety. The mos t recent incidence of impotent vaccines broke out in 2018, affecting over 200,000 children (The Lancet 2018; Yuan 2018) . Drug safety surveillance is an area that needs major reform (Liu 2016; K. Zhang 2017) . Weak equivalence testing is another reason for low quality of drugs. Hi storically , there was no mandatory equivalence tes ting against the innovator drug as part of the generic drug approval system; only conformity with a weak standard was required. Feedback from expert interviews suggested that the first generic drugs would a chieve about 80% efficacy of the originator, then and then the second generic drugs would achieve about 80% efficacy of the first generic drugs. Lack of stringent requirements had led to varying quality of generic drugs. China started to overhaul the equi valence testing process in 2016 , making the procedures for regulation more closely aligned with international standards (Zhen, Sun, and Dong 2018) . Deadlines were set for already approved drugs to retroactively pass equivalence testing against the innovator drugs; drugs approved before October 2007 would have to pass the test by the end of 2018, with some exceptions to pass by the end of 2021. Failure to meet the deadline would risk revocation of registration licenses . Moreover, it was announced that for each drug, only the first three manufacturers that passed bioequivalence tests wo uld be allowed in the procurement process; manufacturers that passed the tests later would in principle lose their market in centralized procurement. Prior to 2016, generic products were eligible for registration on the basis of a single in vitro comparati ve bioavailability study to demon strate equivalence. A lack of clear equivalence assessment likely contributes to the poor perceptions of generic drugs, present in both doctors and patients. The 2016 reform requires that companies undertake comparative stu dies to maintain or renew their l icenses. Originator drugs should be used as the comparator. Where comparators are not available, full scale clinical efficacy and safety trials should be conducted. Following submission of study results, development and pro duction sites will be inspected, and three consecutive batches will be tested to control the quality of drug products. Generic products previously registered in Europe, U.S., or Japan, can apply to renew registration for the generic drug in China without conducting additional comparative studies. In 2017, the State council issued a major reform policy document which provided further clarification for strengthening approval of generic products. This document stated that filing management for equivalence st udies will be introduced. Separat e regulations will allow qualifying medical institutions, academic institutions and private facilities to conduct equivalence tests. Substitution lists will be established for all originators. Under the new system central procurement of off -patent medicine s will be restricted to products which have received equivalence certification. Exceptions are in place for molecules with less than three generic versions certified, in order to ensure supply remains sufficient. In these c ases, priority for procurement sh ould still be given to certified products, before non -certified versions are procured. Unfortunately, recent reports suggest that re -registration of generic products has been a slow \"Historically drug approval was quite a mess. Many substandard drugs were approved. Some more advanced drugs, like cancer targeting agents, requires a lot of technological know -how so many small manufacturers were not able to make them. But more common medicines such as antibiotics, basically flooded the market, with dozens of m anufacturers\" producing the same drug of varying quality.\" - Leading academic expert Pharmaceutical Policy in China 27 and opaque process lacking proper integra tion with regulatory authorities. Further reform is likely needed to continue improving the quality and perception of domestically produced products in China (J. Sun et al. 2018) . One of the key aims of the 2016 reform was to clear all drug backlogs and to ensure that all new applications from 2018 onwards are rev iewed within a specified timeframe. Despite the stringent deadlines and strong incentives, progress was slower than intended. By the end of November 2018, only 90 out of 289 EML drugs have completed bioequivalence testing. On 28th December 2018, NMPA annou nced to abolish the 2018 deadlines and allowed drug manufacturers to apply for an extension of less than 5 years if it could be demonstrated that the drugs meet urgent clinical and market demand, although drugs passing tests earlier would be prioritized to be included in EML. As o f April 2019, the NHC announced that 239 drugs out of 685 listed in the EML had passed bio -equivalence tests. Another issue in the process of drug approval is the quality and authenticity of data submitted by drug manufacturers. In 2015, CFDA required pharmaceutical companies to self -assess clinical trial data submitted in drug approval applications. By 2016, 1184 (over 80%) drug applications were withdrawn, for reasons ranging from incomplete data, data not subject to quality contr ol, to fraud ulent data. Historically, China has also failed to properly distinguish between chemical products, produced synthetically, and biologics, which are derived from microorganisms, parasites, or animals. Only in 2015, has China implemented regula tory stand ards for the registration of biosimilars. These guidelines outlined the application process, classification and dossier requirements, referencing WHO and international guidelines. 4.2.2. International trade of Drugs Weak regulatory approval systems hav e not only had negative consequences for industrialisation of medicines within China, but also at an international level where concerns over quality have limited China's ability to compete in generic exports. Given China's manufacturing capacity, closer al ignment wi th international standards may improve international perception of Chinese products. The 13th FYP, has set a target for at least 100 pharmaceutical formulation manufacturers to gain international accreditation in developed countries (e.g. USA, EU ) by 2020 (B. Huang et al. 2017; Multiple Ministries 2016 ). Given drug approval lag, many patients have turned to illegal importation of drugs in order to obtain treatment. Doctors are placed in an ethical dilemma when p atients ask about treatment options that are not currently available in China. This is particularly significant in the case of \"CFDA asked pharmaceutical companies to assess the quality and authenticity their own submitted clinical trial data. 80% of applications were withdrawn by pharmaceutical companies and CROs (contract research organizations). \" - Marketing exp ert at a pharmaceutical company \"The self -assessment requirement was basically an implicit warning, withdraw fake data without further implications, or go ahead and risking being pun ished. And we saw 80% withdrew.\" - Leading academic expert in pharmaceuti cal policy Pharmaceutical Policy in China 28 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) , which has seen the development of substantial innovation in recent years through the development of dire ct-acting a ntiretroviral agents (DAAs). Until recently, China, despite having the highest number of HCV cases worldwide, did not have DAAs available to patients whose only reimbursed option is the far less effective interferon -alpha. As a result, many pati ents electe d to purchase DAAs in generic form from other countries or areas. Unfortunately, the quality of these products is not always ensured, and this process creates additional legal and ethical issues. Further drug -drug interactions are also another p otential is sue as patients often take interferon -alpha or other drugs concurrently (Han and Liu 2016) . 4.2.3. Expedited app roval of in novative drugs Other attempts to reduce the drug approval backlog beyond the 2016 reform include the implementation of the 'Special Review and Approval scheme' in 2009, which allowed for fast - tracking of new chemical entities for serious conditi ons such as HIV, AIDS, and cancer. The NMPA has recently promised to reform the priority review process to further streamline approval of innovative drugs for HIV/AIDS, cancer, major chronic diseases, orphan disease and for products with high potential eco nomic impac t. While it remains unclear how this will be operationalised and how this may impact approval of non -eligible products, these initiatives signal a clear priority to promote access to medicines for serious diseases (Mossialos et al. 2016) . Within the Chinese 13th Five Year Plan (FYP) for Biotech Sector development (NDRC 2016b) , which was recently issued by the NDRC, the State Council reiterated these objectives, outlining additional plans to accelerate evaluation and approval of urgently needed drugs and medical devices. Under the new conditional approval process, products indicated for serious, life threatening conditions or for serious unmet medical needs can be approved on the basis of early or mid -stage clinical data predicti ve of a clinical benefit with conditions for additional evidence development (Wang and Davidson 2017). 4.2.4. Reforms in Drug Monitoring Beyond reforms in drug approval, China is ac tively building capacity in drug monitoring and review. In October 2018, NHC anno unced timelines to establish a comprehensive clinical assessment system. By 2020, China plans to set up 100 assessment centres, to provide evidence on clinical effectiveness o f key medicines. The assessments are also envisaged to provide support for adjus tments to the EML and for establishing clinical guidelines. A key challenge in this area is to establish clear and specific pathways for this evidence to be included in policy decisions. Another challenge is to build a standardized framework for assessment methods, to ensure comparativeness of evidence. The latter point is a particularly challenging task for TCMs. \"CDE (Center for Drug Evaluation) has enlarged its team from 120 evaluation staff to about 600. This is a major boost in capacity, although better training is needed fo r personne l. Building a well -trained professional team, with great capacity to deal with increasing demand of drug approval and evaluation, is still one of the major challenges facing NEMA. \" - Government policy advisor Pharmaceutical Policy in China 29 Key messages and remaining gaps China has taken an important step to improve the quality of domestically produced generic products through amendments of the Drug Registration Regulation, which moved them closer to international standards. However, the review process for re - registration of new generics has been inefficient and opaque. Drug registration is still subject to significant backlog, and China still lags behind other countries in terms of approval of new medicines. Systematic monitoring and reviewing of drugs post -approval needs to become an integral part of pharmaceutical policy. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 30 4.3. Drug Pricing All products on reimbursed drug lists within China, including generic products, off -patent originator products and in -patent medicines, are subject to pricing regulation at national and provincial level. Following marketing authorisation, drugs can be made available for reimbursement through o ne of two national drug lists, the Essential Medicines List (EML) or the National Reimb ursed Drugs List (NRDL) (Figure 4) . Additionally, each province has a Provincial Reimbursed Drug List (PRDL), which is based on the NRDL. Provinces can modify the NRDL by up to 15% with the addition or subtraction of authorised products, provided they are not on the essential medicines lis t (For more information on the use of formularies in China see section 5.1). Figure 4 - Patient Access Pathway for Medicines in China National level Provincial level PMDA - Marketing Authorisation Listing for Reimbursement (NRDL) New products Recently, 36 innovative products were added to the NRDL following negotiations at national Patient Access Off-patent originators/generic products/TCMs Listing for Reimbursement (NRDL, E ML) Local level Modification of NRDL: Provin ces can modify NRDL by up to 15% (PRDL) Pricing: Provinces determine reimbursement price through negotiation s NRDL and E ML reviewed and modified every 3 to 4 years Modification of NRDL: Provinces can modify NRDL by up to 15% (PRDL) Pricing: Provincia l tendering determines reimbursement price. Tenders issued by INN Procurement : Hospitals procure directly from manufacturers or wholesalers. Provinces procure drugs for primary care facilities Procurement: Hospitals proc ure directly from manufacturers or wholesalers. Provinces procure drugs for primary care facilities Other in - patent products are subject to provincial negotiation Two-invoice system limits distribution chain to one distributor between manufacturer and hospitals Hospitals often use secon dary negotiation to obtain a lower price than the winning tender price Price-cuts are often applied between rounds of tendering Pharmaceutical Policy in China 31 Historically, China's drug pricing policy has been criticized for producing a large gap in price levels between off -patent originators and generics, and for lacking a clear and transparent mechanism for pricing in -patent products. Recent pricing reforms wi thin China have attempted to create a more unified system for pricing generic and off -patent originator products, in addition to establishing guidelines for state -regulated pricing of in -patent products . The following sections provide an overview pricing p olicies for generic, off -patent originator and in -patent products respectively. Table 6 at the end of the section provides a summary of the various pharmaceutical pricing policies used within the Chinese h ealthcare system. 4.3.1. Tendering - Generic and off -patent originator products Prior to 2015, the price o f generic products on either the national reimbursed drug list or provincial reimbursed drug lists within China were regulated through price ceilings based on cost-plus pricing, provincial tendering, and price cutting (Table 5) . At national level, t he NDRC set a maximum retail price based on a cost -plus pricing methodology for both locally produced products and for imported products on the National Reimbursed Drug List. For locally manufactured products, the maximum retail price was calculated based on an a ddition of production costs, a capped level of promotional expenses, a VAT of 17%, a profit margin ranging from 15 -50%, and hospital mark -up. For imported products, maximum retail price was calculated based on the cost insurance and freight ( CIF) price, a duty of 4 -6%, a VAT of 17%, landing costs of up to 2%, a profit margin ranging from 15 -50%, and hospital mark -up. At provincial level, all products on the EML and many of the products on the PRDL were subject to a tendering process to determine ac tual re tail price, whereby various manufacturers submit bids for the right to supply healthcare facilities within the province (Table 5) . The government mandates that hospitals purchase a minimum of 80% of their drugs from winning tender lists. In this con text th e maximum retail price set by the NRDC would serve as the starting bid. For PRDC specific products Provincial Development and Reform Committees would set the starting price (Hsiao, Li, and Zhang 2015) (Yip and Hsiao 2015) . The method of tendering varies across provinces, with differences seen in the qualification criteria and number of possible winners (Zou et al. 2016; Man et al. 2016) . Most provinces employ some variation of the Anhui Province 's \"two-envelope\" system, with separate envelopes for drug quality and drug pr icing. Further, some provinces have separate tenders for generic and originator products for the same molecule, under the assumption that the products vary based on quality (McTiernan 2014) . Several criticisms to the tendering process have emerged . While tendering has successfully lowered prices of EML medicines (Z. Wang et al. 2015) , many provinces place priority on price over quality, leading to generic firms lowering quality in order to undercut prices and win bids (Development Research Center of the State Council 2015). Further, awarding tenders to single companies has the potential to create monopolies and drug shortages if winning companies face supply issues (Barber et al. 2013; X. Li 2016) . \"Because some generic drugs ar e low in quality, the medical insurances cover both originators and generics of the same mole cule. This wouldn't happen if generics are of the same quality as originators. Many patients don't trust the quality of generics; they would choose originators as long as they can afford it. At hospitals, particularly at higher -tier hospitals, the majority of doctors would recommend originators to patients.\" - Leading academic expert Pharmaceutical Policy in China 32 The maximum retail price of generic products was also subject to periodic price cuts. These price cuts were determined predominantly by the bidding price through provincial tendering, although the NRDC conducted cost surveys every two years which also fact ored in. In principle, the price cuts would not lower the maximum retail price beyond the average bid prices plus hospital mark - up. Despite years of utilising price ceilings and pri ce cuts, a substantial body of evidence emerged suggesting these policies were ineffective at reducing drug costs. In May 2014, the N DRC issued a notice which abolished the use of drug price ceilings for generic products, in an attempt to help close the ga p between generic and off -patent originator products. However, price cutt ing in subsequent rounds of tendering is still a common practice across many provinces. In order to ensure companies did not engage in price fixing under this new system, the NRDC als o issued a notice on enhancing the supervision of drug market pricing act ivities, with a focus on monitoring for excessive price jumps and anti -competitive behaviour. Manufacturers found to be engaged in price fixing could be banned from the public tenderi ng process for up to two years. Surprisingly, following the abolition of price cutting in 2015 the utilisation of generic products rose slightly, although it is unclear if this is a result of higher generic prices or if other targeted policies played a role. Despite a slight increase in the use of generics, there is still a cle ar preference for higher priced branded products (J. Sun et al. 2018) . Given removal of price cutting policies, the state council also issued a notice on improving centralized bidding and procurement of drugs in 2015. Here, the state council o utlined that provincial tendering would become the primary mechanism for pricing off -patent products on the NRDL. This notice addresses several issues of tendering by drug quality with the aim of creating a more transparent and unified system (Mossialos et al. 2016) . Further reform took place in 2018, through a State Council notice which requires tendering to take place by generic name, thereby assuming equival ence between generic and off-patent originator products (State Council 2018) . Like generic products, off -patent originators within China were subject to cost -plus pricing at national level, provincial tendering, and price cuts prior to 2015 (Table 5) . While the N DRC would set a maximum retail price, local governments were able to adjust this price for originato r products considered to be of greater quality than the generic versions. This product would receive a pricing privilege. Further, the two -envelope system of tendering and provincial practices of creating different tiers within tenders for generic product s and off -patent originators led to pricing monopolies for off -patent originator products. Originator products would be procured at a higher winning bid price , while generic products faced stiffer competition and therefore lower prices. (Mossialos et al. 2016) . The NDRC attempted to reduce this gap, through \"Now a unified information system is in place. All provincial prices must be reported to central government health administrations or health insurance authorities. So there is a trend of a common market within the whole China. Provincial prices are converging. But there is also a side effect, in that there is too much emphasis on getting the l owest price. This is not healthy. One consequence is shortage of drugs. The government 's countermeasure is to establish a list of essential drugs and designate the supply to a small number of manufacturers. Manufacturers are willing to accept low prices be cause the volumes in the national market are huge, which makes low prices sustainable. \" - Leading academic expert - Pharmaceutical Policy in China 33 price c uts based on the price gap over generic products, manufacturer costs, expense levels and average b idding prices. In theory, drugs with larger gaps between originator and generic versions would receive larger price cuts. In practice, these price cuts were largely ineffective at reducing the gap between originator and generic products (Mossialos et al. 2016) . As a result, the use of price ceiling and preferenti al pricing was abolished in 2015. As a replacement for nationally set price ceilings, the NDRC imp lemented an internal reference pricing system for generic and off -patent originators with high levels of competition. This system places a cap on the level of reimbursement for these products. At the time of announcement in 2015, no details were provided o n the methodology for determining the reimbursement level. In principle , regulations for setting reimbursement caps will be set at national level, while provi ncial level governments will set the levels. In theory, implementing a reimbursement cap allows ho spitals to negotiate below the cap with manufacturers in order to lower costs. Through revisions of reimbursement caps based hospital procurement prices, this process will gradually put price pressure on pharmaceutical companies. Caps will be set according to generic names, eliminating the possibility for a preferential pricing of off-patent originators. Finally, reforms in the provincial tendering process and in equivalence testing will likely help t o bridge the gap between the quality and price of gene ric and off -patent originator products. Under the most recent state council guidance, provinces are now required to issue tenders according to molecule name and cannot differentiate between originator a nd generic products (State Council 2018) . In principle, this should promote gre ater use and procurement of gen eric products. 4.3.2. Negotiations - In-patent products In-patent products are priced based on negotiation by the State Administration for Medical Insurance (SAMI - formerly this was the NDRC 's responsibility ), although this proc ess is not formalised. Recently, the Chinese government implemented a negotiation pilot in an attempt to reach a n acceptable agreement on the price of 44 high priced, but innovative medicines. Agreement was successfully reached for 36 of 44 medicines. Prior to the pilot, pricing negotiations took place between NHFPC, local governments and manufacture rs, but the negotiations were small in scope and most of the process was closed from pharmaceutical suppliers. Guidance issued by the NHFPC indicates that a sel ection of in -patent products will be \"Current pric ing mechanism for innovative drugs are mainly done through pricing negotiations. We have seen three batches of such negotiations. The first attempt was led by NHFPC, where they succeeded in negotiating prices for three drugs out of an intended five. But th ere was an issue at the regional levels. Health administrative authorities were not the payers. Health insurance funds were the payers. Now after three bat ches of pricing negotiations, it is increasingly clear that heal th insurance funds should lead the ne gotiations. Once prices are negotiated, the drugs can be immediately included in the health insurance reimbursement lists.\" - Government policy advisor \"You would expect prices to drop shortly after patents expire. But you don't see that. Off - patent drug still command high prices, and they are not short of demand .\" - Academic expert in pharmaceutical policy Pharmaceutical Policy in China 34 eligible for national negotiations, while others will proceed through provi ncial negotiation, although it remains unclear how these products will be differentiated in the future (Figure 4) . The role of negotiation s in the pricing and reimbursement of medicines was fu rther discussed in the 13th FYP (Multiple Ministries 2016) . Specifically, the plan states that selected patented and exclusively -produced drug products will be subject to negotiations at national lev el, with the number of products increasing gradually o ver time. Priority review status, patent life and pharmaco -economics should be key considerations in the negotiation process. Other patented medicines, or off -patent medicines with low levels of competi tion, are priced through provincial negotiation, altho ugh the details of the process are unclear (Multiple Ministries 2016) . The process remains opaque and requires formalisation. Clarity must be given on the assessment of medicines in terms of the subm ission process, types of evidence considered, evaluati on criteria and assessment timelines. 4.3.3. Reference Pricing In 2012 , the NDRC conducted a pricing survey in order to explore potential applications of external reference pricing within the Chinese system. The survey applied to both in -patent and off-patent products. A basket of 9 countries was included: the USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the manufacturer's country (Table 5) . Data was collected on both the retail and reimbursed price. As a rule, the price of the identical strength/pack size was submitted, unless unavailable whereby alternative prices would be provided. In 2015 , the NDRC issued guidance for the implemen tation of external reference pricing. Multinational corporations were required to provide information on drug prices in their home country as well as prices in the European countries, the USA, and additional markets in Asia and Africa. In theory , reference pricing would be used to inform the starting bid f or provincial tenders for off -patent products and would be used as a starting point in negotiations for in -patent products (Mossialos et al. 2016) . Within the 13th FYP, the State Council reiterated \"For innovative drugs reference pricing is used, although it's not specified which countries form the reference basis. The main countries that drug m anufacturers include in their dossier include US, UK, Germany, France, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan. Taiwan and Hong Kong are sometimes included as well. So, although we don't have an official country basket, drug manufacturers have to re port their prices in a number of countries mentioned b efore. On average, price negotiations reduced the prices by 44% for the second batch, and 54% for the third batch.\" - Leading academic expert - \"I was recently at a WHO conference. One notion they tried to promote was fairness pricing, not low p ricing. Fairness pricing is about su stainable development of the industry, not going bankrupt. I think this notion is now gradually accepted by the Chinese government. It should be about a reasonable price, not necessarily the lowest price. This is one of the positive developments recently.\" - Leading academic expert \"The two main criteria for deciding what drugs should be included in the negation list, are high price and high volume . Those are the main concerns for the general public. These two factors le ad to affordability issues on a large scale so we try to work on that. \" - Government policy stakeholder Pharmaceutical Policy in China 35 these objectives, outlining plans to accelerate evaluation and approval of urgently needed drugs and medical devices (NDRC 2016b) . Evidence from expert interviews suggests that while external reference pricing is in use, there is currently no systematic standards for cross -country referencing. On the other hand, at the region al level, prices across provinces are increasingly more transparent, which leads to procurers often demanding the lowest available price in other provinces. Wh ile this may help form converging prices across provinces, it cannot be ignored that in the prese nce of market fragmentation, each province has a market of its own size. Larger markets can absorb high volumes which could lead to production efficiency and l ower costs and in consequence lower prices; smaller markets may need to take into account higher unit-costs during price negotiation due to low volumes of demand. Table 6 - Summary of Pharmaceutical Pricing Policies in China Pricing Policy Scope Descripti on Effect Price ceilings (cost-plus pricing) Used to set maximum retail prices of products on National Reimbursed Drug List (Abolished in 2014) Price ceiling set based on production costs + capped promotional expenses + 17% VAT + 15-50% profit margin +hospital mark-up. Imported products calculated based on CIF price, duty, VAT, landing costs, profit margins, and hospital mark -up. Failed to adequately control overall drug spending. Physicians evaded price ceilings by switching to more expensive p roducts or by increasing volume of prescriptions. Price-cuts Applied to maximum retail prices periodically as cost - containment measure Fixed reduction in maximum retail price of a product, based on cost - surveys of average retail price. Applied between rounds of tendering. Lowered prices of targeted drugs by 15 - 20% on average, but failed to control overall drug spending. Tendering Primary pricing mechanism for generic and off - patent medicines. Applied provincially Tenders issued provincially for the supply of a molecule. Tenders are issued by International Non - proprietary Names (INN). Manufacturers submit bid s based on maximum retail price. Hospitals are required to procure 80% of products from winning tender lists. Successful at lowering drug prices by 25 -50%. Historically emphasized price over quality and contributed to both low quality of generic medicines and off -patent originator price monopolies. Negotiations Primary pricing mechanism for in - patent products. Applied nationally and provincially. Conducted by State Administration for Medical Insurance (SAMI - at national level) or by Provincial Developmen t Reform Committees (PDRC - at provincial level). Agreements reached for 36 out of 44 p roducts in negotiations pilot . Products added to NRDL. Secondary Negotiations Between hospitals and manufacturers/wh olesalers. Informal negotiations during drug procur ement between hospitals and manufacturers/ wholesalers. Actual drug volume is specified and hospitals often obtain a lower price than the listed tender winning price. Provides additional profits to hospitals and lowers the effective price of products. May create incentives to overprescribe drugs with high profit margins. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 36 External Reference Pricing Informally used for innovative products International price data is included in submission dossier for innovative products. No formal guidelines are in place and there is currently no systematic standard for cross -country referencing. Most manufacturers include data from US, UK, Germany, France, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan. N/A (Source: the Authors) Key messages and remaining gaps Pricing for generics and off-patent originators takes place primarily through provincial tendering, following abolishment of national price ceiling and price cutting policies. While no formal system has been established for pricing in -patent products, a select number of products have proceeded through negotiations at state level. In practice, other products are priced through negotiations at provincial level. Implementation of tendering varies considerably across regions. In some regions, price is valued over drug quality, incen tivizing companies to lower quality in order to undercut prices. Separate tenders are frequently issued for generic and originator products which perpetuates pricing monopolies. The negotiation process remains opaque and requires formalisation. Clarity m ust be given on the assessment of medicines in terms of the submission process, types of evidence considered, evaluation criteria and assessment timelines. Clarity is required on how managed entry agreements can be used wit hin the negotiation process to he lp facilitate agreements. External reference pricing has only been implemented recently and the impact thus far remains unclear. More clarity is needed on how external reference pricing has been operationalised. It is uncl ear how the starting bid price is set for products which are ineligible for external reference pricing. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 37 4.4. Drug Procurement The drug tendering pro cess within China is not directly linked to the procurement of medicines. Procurement of pharmaceuticals occurs in separate processes for hospitals and primary care facilities. While pharmaceuticals for primary health facilities are p rocured at provincial level, hospitals procure their products directly from manufacturers. Following a provincial tender, hospitals are required to deal directly with manufacturers or wholesalers in order to procure drugs. Prior to 2015, this process often involved secondary ne gotiation, whereby a hospital would agree on drug volume s and negotiate and procure products at a lower price than the winning tender price. This practice occurred only in some provinces, while others required procurement at the winni ng bid price. Opinions on the use of secondary negotiation were mixed. Some thought that added competition at the local level would help drive down prices and produce a more efficient system. However, secondary negotiation has the potential to undermine th e zero mark - up policy, as hospitals are able to produce a profit margin between the tender price and secondary price. This may create incentives to overprescribe products with the largest margin to maximize hospital revenue. In response to concerns regardi ng secondary negotiati on, the NHFPC issued a notice on implementing and improving centralized bidding and procurement of drugs. This notice requires hospitals to acquire 80% of their medications from the list of products that underwent provincial tendering and requires that dru g sales do not exceed 25 -30% of total hospital revenue (NHFPC 2015) . Recently, as part of the 13th FYP, the State Council outlined plans to continue to enhance the nationwide pharmaceutical distribution network in order to cover both urban and rural areas. As part of this process a national drug information public service p latform will be estab lished to publicize information on price and quality (Multiple Ministries 2016) . In 2017, the State Council issued a major reform policy with implications on drug procurement. Specifically, the polic y aims to improve the procuremen t of high quality generic products. Under the 2017 reforms, provinces are unable to procure products that have yet to pass equivalence review if three or more generic products for an originator have done so. In cases where l ess than three generic products have passed equivalence studies, the products having passed review should still be preferred (State Council 2017) . Increasingly, China will also aim to promote inter -regional pr ocurement of medicines. The 2017 health care reforms encourage both medical institutions and regions to collaborate in the procurement of medicines. Public hospitals will be able to purchase products directly from provincial centralized drug purchase platf orms. Joint procurement of medicines will likely play a key role in strengthening China's capacity and ability to engage in pri ce negotiations at both central and provincial level (State Council 2017) . \"A principle in existing drug procurement is to establish a \"procurement platform under the sun\", in the sense that pricing information is transparent and shared online. From the persp ective of the procurement body, If I see a drug listed for a certain price at another province, I'll ask for the same price if not lower. But the volume is never specified. This puts a lot of pressure on drug manufacturers. In practice, some manufacturers are not even considering lowering prices for large provincial markets, as they fear other smaller markets see the low price at this province and demand the same.\" - Expert from health -promotion foundation Pharmaceutical Policy in China 38 There have alread y been some pilots of cross -municipality or cross -province group purchasing organizations (GPOs). One prominent example , the 4+7 procurement group overseen by the SMIA, organizes pharmaceutical procurement for the four directly -controlled municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing) plus seven other large cities (Shenyang, Dalian, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu, and Xi'an) (See Figure 5) The commitment of procurement quantities is an improvement of the pricing process. Under most current mechanisms, the tendering process sets a ceiling price, but does not specify the quantity of procurement. Th is essentially leads to a secondary market, where pharmaceutical manufacturers end up in second round of negotiations with hospitals for their medi cines to enter the hospital pharmacies, resulting in either lowering the prices or giving rebates to hospitals. This means the tender bid prices are not binding, and actual prices are set in the secondary market. With the committed quantity, manufacturers do not have to spend extra resources to make sure they get orders from hospitals after the tendering process. I nterviews with KOLs posit that quantity commitment will be a direction of future reforms to the pricing mechanism. Figure 5. Group Purchasing Or ganization Case Study Case Study - Cross Province Group Purchasing Organizations (GPO) Pilot Description Pilot study for joint procurement of medicines across 11 municipalities in the Chinese pharmaceutical market. The GPO is overseen by the National Medi cal Insurance Administration (SMIA). Municipalities involved: 4+7 Procurement group: fo ur directly -controlled municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing) plus seven other large cities (Shenyang, Dalian, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu , and Xi'an). Collectively these 11 cities constitute 25% of the Chinese pharmaceutical mark et. Drugs involved 31 drugs listed in tendering process, with fixed intended quantities. Quantities represented 30 -50% of procurement volumes in included hospitals . Results Sharp drop in listed drug prices. Over two thirds of products had a drop of over 30%, with the large st drop exceeding 90%. Another critical issue from the tendering process is that procurers focus heavily on prices, and less on quality. Due to the lack of quality standards historically, different versions of the same generic drug vary substantially in quality. In reality, the emphasis on low price means usua lly the lowest bid wins, which is inevitably associated with lower quality. Tiered ten dering by quality addresse d this issue to some extent, by issuing a separate tender for higher quality products, but this system lacks a scientific approach , leads to gre ater market fragmentation and leads to more fierce secondary negotiations. As discusse d above, i ncorporating a requirement to pass bioequivalence tests as a prerequisite into the tendering process is a promising development for addressing quality issues. Under the new development, only manufacturers that have passed the bioequivalence tests are allowed to submit bids; further, f or each medicine there is a limit on the number of bidders to be allowed, which means manufacturers passing bioequivalence later will be driven out of the market. While manufacturers race to pass the bioequivalence te sts before the deadline in December 201 8, there is no empirical evidence yet as to whether the drugs that have passed these tests are indeed of good quality standards. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 39 Key messages and remaining gaps Health faciliti es frequently engage in secondary negotiation. This process remains opaque and it is unclear how large the difference is between the tender price and the secondary price. This could create distorted incentives for hospitals to overprescribe products with t he largest profit margi n and undermine the aim of the zero mark -up policy. While the NHFPC has issued notices aiming to address issues in secondary negotiation, it remains unclear what steps have been taken and how this issue varies across provinces. Qua ntity commitment is a p romising avenue for avoiding secondary negotiations, but it remains to be seen whether this can be implemented on a large scale. Emphasis on lowering prices without stringent regulatory requirements has contributed to drug quality i ssues. The pricing process needs to strike the right balance between price and quality. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 40 4.5. HTA Despite the 2009 health reforms, there are still significan t challenges in China regarding pharmaceutical policy from a supply -side policy perspective. Since 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) has issued policies to guide and strengthen the implementation and use of HTA in China (Y. Chen et al. 2018) . However, the use of HTA has not yet been formalised and current uses have been predominantly academic. W hilst policy makers are aware of HTA, it is not mandatory to utilise or implement it on a national scale. Therefore it is not fully embedded in the policy making process (Y. Chen et al. 2018) . When HTA is conducted, there are large gaps between the understanding and integration between HTA i tself, knowledge translation and policy -making (Wei et al. 2017) . For instanc e, in a qualitative study interviewing both HTA researchers and policy makers, HTA researchers believed that their research was high - quality and rele vant for policy -making, but policy -makers do not use evidence -based approaches when making health decisions (Wei et al. 2017) . In contrast, policy -makers believed their decisions are largely evidence -based, but the HTA researc h is of low quality. This research indicates that the alignment between research and decision making needs to be improved in order to provide higher quality research as well as more informed decisions. Thus, insufficient communication between stakeholders is a key barrier in the HTA process in addition to inadequate policy support and funding. Beyond stakeholde r engagement, the institutionalisation of HTA is a second conducive factor for strengthening HTA systems (MacQuilkan et al. 2018) . The establishment of the National Pharmaceutical and Health Technology Assessment Center in October 2018 was one of the first steps towards integrating HTA into policy. Recently, a pricing negotiations pi lot within China represented the first instance of evaluating evidence dossiers submitted by manufacturers. While the pilot was associated with some success through the listing of products on the NRDL (see section 4.4), criticism emerged surrounding the evaluation process which lacked clear guidelines on evidence requirements , assessment criteria, and assessment timelines (Hong Li et al. 2018) . Interviews with KOLs also confirm these assessments. Beyond utilizi ng HTA for the purposes of informing price negotiations, China has also indicated interest in using HTA to help guide reimbursement decisions. The 13th FYP outlined plans for consolidating and improving the essential drug system. In this context, China int ends to explore how clinical and economic evidence can be used in the s election of essential drugs. The key challenge in this area is to find clear and specific pathways to include HTA as part of the policy -making process. While this will be a long -term process, policy makers could start with \"HTA has had some positive effects. But I don't think a large country like China can build an HTA system like NICE. It's just some individual cases at the moment. For instance, pharmaceutical economists are involved in some pricing negotiations. They ca n make suggestions; drug manufacturers also present some evidence based on HTA. But it's impossible to exclude certain drugs based on HTA evidence. Maybe one or two, but that's the size of it. But I do have to say HTA as a concept is more and more widely a ccepted by pharmaceutical companies and government. This is for sure...Overall, HTA may serve in an advisory role; health administrations and health insurance authorities make the final call. \" - Leading academic expert - Pharmaceutical Policy in China 41 clarifying the requirements of evidence they would like to see as the basis of policy decisions. An open and transparent process would help form correct expectations and guide pharmaceutical manufacturers towards uti lizing HTA to their own benefit. Key messages and remaining gaps While the establishment of guidelines intending to strengthen the use of HTA in China is a positive step, HTA is still rarely used in decision making for the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. Without a formalised and integrated HTA system, China lacks a clear value framework for the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. As a result, it remains unclear if national health system priorities translate to decision makin g in the pharmaceutical sector. The key challenge is to establish clear and specific pathways to include HTA as part of the policy -making process. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 42 5. Recent Trends and Reforms in D emand -side Policies Over the past two decades demand -side policy reforms have been implemented both at state level and at regional/county level, with the aim of reducing inappropriate prescribing, improving microeconomic efficiency and improving quality of care (Mao et al. 2015) . Demand -side policies can be subdivided into proxy -demand side policies which target health care providers, and demand -side pol icies which target p atients. 5.1. Proxy -demand side policies 5.1.1. Formularies A. National Reimbursement Drug List (NDRL) The Chinese national reimbursed drug list (NRDL) was formally established in 2000. There have been 3 updates to the formulary: one in 2004, one in 2 009, and another between the end of 2016 and February 2017. Following the most recent update, there are 2,53 5 medicines in the NRDL (1297 western, and 1238 are TCMs). The 2017 update added 339 new medicines to the formulary. A specific focus was placed on areas of serious disease, paediatric medications, medications for work -related accidents, and TCMs. Despite the update, several expensive but innovative products are excluded from the formulary. Historically, many in -patent products have been subject to fr ee pricing and excluded from the NRDL, which is only updated every three or four years. Newly approved produ cts that have missed the update window often had to wait years before their product was eligible for reimbursement. Non -reimbursed drugs are typical ly priced freel y by manufacturers. Patients were required to bear the full cost of these products. Recently, the Chinese government implemented a negotiation pilot in an attempt to reach an acceptable agreement on the price of 44 high priced, but innovativ e medicines. Prior to the pilot, pricing negotiations took place between NHFPC, local governments and manufa cturers, but the negotiations were small in scope and most of the process was closed from pharmaceutical suppliers. The pilot introduced the concept of submitting evidence dossiers for the first time. Overall, an agreement was reached for 36 out of 44 medi cines that entered the pilot. The negotiated products were added to the NRDL without provincial modification (Li et al. 2018). The inclusion of high -priced innovative drugs indicates a recognition of value -based healthcare concept. There is a gentle shift from solely focusing on driving down healthcare costs towards address ing unmet needs. Meanwhile, this also reflects that political and public advoca cy is a key factor that shapes pharmaceutical policy decisions. The addition of these drugs is partly incide nt- driven, e.g. the blockbuster movie Dying to Survive has had an impact in pushing some cancer drugs into the NRDL list. Future adjustment s to the list are likely more frequent and dynamic, to reflect changing disease burdens and public health focus. Tha t said, cost containment would remain a long -term focal point for pharmaceutical and health insurance policies. Listed medicines would face pressure from health insurance authorities to lower prices, as a tradeoff for gaining access to a large market. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 43 As the pipeline of e merging technologies such as personalized medicines continues to grow, it is likely to present a number of challenges from a financ ing perspective . China is moving very fast in this direction for a number of areas. For instance, there has been advancement in gene -based precision medicine in China. But this area is mainly funded by pharma companies, and there is no clear indication of including these new technologies in the reimbursement list because of their high costs, as cost containment remains a priority policy focus in future. Recent incidents such as the gene -edited babies probably also means government will be more cautious with sponsoring such technologies. On the other hand, China's vast market size is an important driving factor of these technologies. There are now examples where drugs are first marketed in China before they marketed in neighboring countries such as South Kore a. Overall, while emerging technologies are growing fast in China, inclusion of these technologies into the public health insurance system has a long way to go. High costs and questions surrounding the extent to which these technologies address pressing un met needs are the major obstacles for these technologies to enter the health insurance system. B. Provincial R eimbursement Drug List (PRDL) Each province has a Provincial Reimbursed Drug List (PRDL), which is based on the NRDL. Provinces can modify the NRDL by up to 15% with the addition or subtraction of authorised products, provided they are not on the essential medicines list . The NRDL is divided into class A drugs, considered to be effective, essential, and relatively cheap and class B drugs, considered to be less effective . Class A drugs must be fully reimbursed, while class B drugs have varying level of co -payments. PRDLs must include all class A drugs, but can adjust up to 15% of class B drugs to suit local needs. While important recognize variations in need across provinces, concerns have been raised that PRDLs contribute to variations in drug coverage acros s China. Until recently, this was also caused in part by variations in urban and rural health insurance schemes. Introduction of a merged health ins urance scheme is likely to alleviate these issues. (Mossialos et al. 2016) C. Emergency Medicines List (EML) One of the most fundamental reforms in proxy -demand side policy was the establishment of the National Essential Medicines Programme (NEMP), as part o f the 2009 health system reforms. The NEMP regulates drug production, pricing, procurement, and prescribing. One of the first reforms as part of the NEMP was the establishment of an essential drug list for primary care providers (including community health centres, village clinics and township hospitals). The list initially contained 307 drugs, but provinces are able to modify the list based on local disease burden and socioeconomic status. The list is eligible for updates every 3 years. Procurement of drugs on the essential medicines list occurs through tendering at provincial level, based on bid prices capped c entrally (Yun Gon g 2016) . As part of the NEMP, drugs on the EML are subject to a zero mark -up policy, which prevents health care providers and dispensers from increasing the price beyond the winning bid in the procurement process. In theory, preventing mark-ups on essential medicines would remove distorted financial incentives to over -prescribing pharmaceuticals as a source of funding in health care facilities. By then end of 2011, 98.8% of primary care institu tions were implementing the NEMP (Hsiao, Li, and Zhang 2015) . Increasingly since 2009, the zero mark -up policy has also been implemented in public secondary and tertiary Pharmaceutical Policy in China 44 hospi tals for both drugs on the essential medicin es list and for the drugs on the national reimbursed drugs list (NRDL) (Tian et al. 2016; Zesheng Sun, Wang, and Barnes 2016; W. Y. Zhang et al. 2015; T. Zhang, Graham, and White 2018) . Initially, elimination of margins on drug sales in hospitals took place in 100 trial site citie s. In 2016, the state council announced plans to expand hospital reform to 200 cities by the end of the year, with the aim of eventually completely eliminating hospital drug sales margins (State Council 2016) . In 2017, the NHFPC announced that all public hospitals have abandoned drug sale margins (People's Daily 2017) . Evidence on the ability of the National Essential Medicines List and Zero Mark -up Policy to reduce irrational prescribi ng, improve access to medicines and improve efficiency is mixed (Figure 6) . Appropriateness of prescribing is assessed based on 5 indicators: average number of drugs prescribed per prescription, percentage of prescrip tions with antibiotics prescribed, perc entage of prescriptions with injections prescribed, percentage of prescriptions with two or more antibiotics prescribed and average expenditure per prescription (WHO 1993) . Early assessments found that the NEMP resulted in statistically significant reductions in each indicator except for the percentage of prescriptions wi th injection (Honglin Li et al. 2016 ) However, absolute values remained high for all indicators and well above WHO r ecommended levels (Yun Gong 2016; Q. Yao et al. 2015) . A review of irrational prescribing in China r eports that, as of 2015, the original goals of the 2009 reforms have not been achieved. Differences in inappropriate prescribing are seen across rural and urban areas and among different levels of hospitals, with higher levels seen in rural areas. Further, the overuse of injections remains a key challenge in terms of irrational prescribing (Mao et al. 2015) . Figure 6 - Effects of Essential Medicines Lis t and Zero Mark -up policy Hospitals request rebates to recoup losses in drug sales Hospitals began to rely more heavily on healthcar e services for revenue 83% of drug stock-out instances are for essential medicines The challenge of access to expensive life - saving drugs has not been systematically addresses 48.2% increase in availability of essential medicines in Hangzhou and Baoji Significant improvements seen in 4 out 5 indicators of appropriate prescribing Reduction in inappropriate prescribing Encourages secondary negotiation Essential Medicines List and Zero Mark - up Policy Promotes overuse of other health services (e.g. examinations) Improved availability of essential medicines in primary health facilities Drug shortages and stock -outs remain an issue Excludes several expensive, but life-saving medicines Pharmaceutical Policy in China 45 Beyond irrational prescribing, other unintended consequences of these policies saw hospitals resort to demanding rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers in secondary price negotiations and raising revenues from un necessary examinations, to compensate for the loss of revenue from drug sales. As government subsidies only contribute about 10% of public hospital revenues, and generally government compensation for loss of drug sales revenue is inadequate, hospitals have an economic incentive to seek revenues from other avenues. A positive e ffect of these policies on the healthcare workforce, is that healthcare services (e.g. consultations) are compensated better, an improvement from the historically low payment standards for the workforce. On the negative side, unnecessary examinations lead to waste of healthcare resources. The key challenge for policy makers is to provide correct incentives for healthcare providers with the right compensation, to guide their behaviors to wards more efficient use of healthcare resources. In terms of access to medicines, the NEMP appears to have made some progress in terms of expanding coverage; however, patients still face significant barriers in access due to high levels of out -of-pocket expenditure. In a study of primary health facilities in Hangzhou and Bao ji, the EML resulted in a 48.2% increase in the availability of essential medicines, and patients generally reported that their medicines needs were met. However, out of pocket payment s were still substantial for medicines outside of the list and medicines costs still accounted for a major part of patient's annual health expenditure (over 40% of THE in 2010) (Y. Huan g et al. 2018) . Drug shortages and stock -outs also remain an issue. An investigation in 2010 reports that, of 284 medicines found to be out -of-stock in at least one facility through out various levels of health care, 83% were on the EML. A later report i n 2015, found that out of the 780 medicines on the NRDL, 357 medicines were out -of-stock. In particular, these reports suggested a poor buffering and alert capacity of inventory contro l systems currently used through health facilities in China (J. Sun et al. 2018) . Finally, several expensive but potentially life -saving drugs remain outside of the EML. Although recent negotiation pilot programmes successfully added 36 of 44 medicines evaluated into the NRDL, the problem of access to innovative an d expensive life -saving drugs has not been systematically addressed with in China (Hong Li et al. 2018) . While the NEMP has placed some control on public expenditure of medicines, total pharmaceutical expenditure and total health expenditure within China have continued to exceed GDP growth since 2009. At the macroeconomic level, the NEMP has not achieved the desired reductions in pharmaceutical expenditure as the distorted consumer and provider incentives have not fundamentally changed, despite some marginal improvements in rational p rescribing. At the microeconomic level, preferences for injectables and for higher priced branded medicines remain an issue, limiting potential efficiency gains from cheaper oral produ cts or generic products. The latter likely stems from the perceived poor quality of domestically produced generic products (J. Sun et al. 2018; W. Zeng et al. 2015; J. Zeng et al. 2015) . Further, while drug revenue has decreased as a result of the ZMU, use of inpatient care has increased \"Drug sale was a major source of hospital revenues. After zero mark up policy, hospitals had to rely on more healthcare services. Services like consultations are seeing their prices increase, but it's not enough yet. So now a lot of revenues are coming from examinations. An overuse of examinations. If you want to have a CT scan at a developed country, there is usually a long waiting list; in China, it's available everywhere. It's very convenient, yes, you can get the results even within the same day; but oft en it's also a waste of resources. - Expert at a h ospital -based research centre Pharmaceutical Policy in China 46 substantially, indic ating that health care providers have sought new forms of revenue (Yu and Xu 20 15; Zheng et al. 2015; Yun Gong 2016; J. Huang et al. 2015; Wu, He, and Mao 2016; Dai et al. 2015; H. Yi et al. 2015; Xi. Yi et al. 2018; Zhuolin Sun, Ding, and Li 2017; H. Tan et al. 2016) Studies reflecting on the NEMP also highlighted a correlation b etween levels of medical training and rational prescribing, suggesting enhanced training of health care professionals as a priority for future reform (Yun Gong 20 16). Further, years of over -prescribing have distorted physician and patient expectations around prescribing leading to widespread perceptions that antibiotics are 'cure all' and that injections have increased efficacy compared to orally administered drug s. (Yun Gong 2016) . Overall, there are nine influential factors that c ontribute towards irrational prescribing: 1) provider's lack of knowledge, 2) patient's lack of knowledge, 3) poor quality of health services, 4) human resources issues at health facilities, 5) pressure f rom heavy patient load, 6) pressure from patients de mand, 7) economic incentive and profits from prescribing medicines, 8) insurance status of patients, and 9) lack of effective control and regulatory mechanisms on medicines use (Mao et al. 2015) .Finally, the implementation of the NEMS and zero mark -up policy has fundamentally changed village doctor roles. In order to compensate loss of income, the Chine se government began to pay doctors to implement publ ic health activities and to provide other services covered by social insurance. Despite these changes, village doctors have reported inconsistency in payments, a substantial decrease in income and an over all decrease in satisfaction resulting from the NEMS and the zero mark -up policy (S. Zhang et al. 2015) . In the most r ecent round of reforms, the State Council issued further guidance on the essential drugs list, stipulating that the NHFPS conducts an e valuation of clinical drug consumption of essential medicines within public hospitals. By 2020, the essential medicines l ist should be expanded to provide greater coverage of clinical pathways and should be implemented in all level II or greater hospitals.1 However, the specific criteria guiding this assessment remain unclear (State Council 2017) . 1 Within China, hospitals care classified within a three tiered system, based on the institutions ability to provid e medical care and conduct medical research. Scoring is based on a number of factors including human and physical resources, type and number o f departments, and teaching and research capabilities. The highest tier is reserved for tertiary hospitals conside red to be domestic leaders in medical care with international influence (Mossialos et al. 2016). Key messages and remaining gaps Until recently, new products had to wait up to 3 or 4 years for addition to the NRDL. The process of adding new products to the NRDL requires formalization Emerging technologies , such as pers onalised medicine, are growing fast in China, but high costs and needs -based concerns are the major obstacles for them to enter the public health insurance system. The zero -mark-up policy has removed a substantial portion of health facility reven ues, and government subsidies have not adequately compensated for this loss. Consequently, utilisation of other fee -for-service health services and unnecessary examinations have increased. The key challenge is for policy to provide the right incentives to guide he althcare providers and practitioners towards rational and efficient use of healthcare resources. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 47 5.1.2. Drug Distribution and Supply Chain Historically, t he supply side of th e pharmaceutical market featured a large number of small manufacturers and many layers of the wholesale distributors, both of which inevitably lead to low economies of scale and higher distributio n costs . Pharmaceutical products go through several middle -man distributors from the manufacturer to reach hospitals and pharmacies. Fragmentation in manufacturing and distribution has led to insufficient regulatory oversight, low drug quality, and high dr ug pric es (J. Hu and Mossialos 2016) . In principle, patients had several potential access routes to pharmaceutical products. Manufacturers cou ld sell directly to patients, through a pharmacy to patients, through a wholesaler to patients, through a wholesaler to hospitals to patients, or through a wholesaler to pharmacy to patients (Figure 7 ). Along the way, distributors would add mark -ups to pro ducts, contributing to the high price of medicines within China. Recently, the Development Research Center of the State Council reported that patients pay upwards of 10 times the ex -factory price of medicines due to mark -ups throughout the distribution cha in, while IMS estimates the increase in price to be 52% (IMS 2015) . Figure 7 - Drug Distribution Chains in the Chinese Pharmaceutical Sector In 2016, the 'two -invoice' policy was launched with the aim of reducing the number of middle - men and mark -ups within the drug distribution chain. Under the 'two -invoice' policy, the number of distributors between manufacturers and hospitals is limited to o ne. Further, both manufacturers and distributors are required to provide invoices reporting the sale price, thereby improving transparency within the distribution system. Exceptions are granted for exclusive Manufacturer Patient Patient Patient Patient Patient Manufacturer Manufacturer Manufacturer Manufacturer Wholesaler Wholesaler Pharmacy Wholesa ler Hospital Hospital Patient Manufacturer Pharmacy Two Invoice Policy Limits number of distributors between manufacturers and hospitals to one. Both Manufacturer and Distributor required to provide invoices In China, 70 -80% of drug sales are thro ugh hospitals vs an average of 20% in developed countries (Mossialos et al. 2 016) 1 2 3 4 5 6 Pharmaceutical Policy in China 48 distributors of imported drugs, for emergency ci rcumstances, distribu tion of specially administered drugs (e.g. anaesthetics) and for distribution to hospitals in remote or rural areas. Hospitals are required to obtain invoices from both the drug manufacturer and the distributor making both the ex -factory price and profit m argins fully transparent to hospitals. Manufacturers found to be non -compliant may be banned from future provincial bidding events and blacklisted from procurement practices. The system was initially launched as a pilot, with the aim o f implementing it in all public hospitals by the end of 2018 (Multiple M inistries 2018) . More recently, and as part of the 2017 major health reform, the State Council identified further reform of the drug distribution system as a key priority. A focus was placed on improving urban and rural distribution networks through con solidation of pharmac eutical distributors. M&As of pharmaceutical distributors will help to integrate warehouse and transportation resources. Further, the state council reiterated the aim of fully implementing the \"two invoice\" policy by 2018 (State Counci l 2017). While there is little empirical evidence on the consequences of the dual -invoice system from peer-review literature, expert interviews suggest that this policy may do little to lower drug prices on its own. It does not address the fundamental issu e that hospitals have an economic incentive to profit from drug sales, thus many demand under -the-table rebates for allowing drugs to enter the hospital. Against this background, many distributors are in fact sales agents for pharmaceutical manufacturers, who are seeking econo mic rents for their connections with hospitals. The dual -invoice policy is a reform on nominal factors. While it could drive many small - scale middle -man distributors out of business, the economic interest links between pharmaceutical m anufacturers and hosp itals remain. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are likely to raise the ex -factory prices to absorb the profits previously earned by distributors through markups , instead of outsourcing this process to distributors. That said, the dual -invoice system is likely to push the pharmaceutical market towards a more concentrated structure, as well as having some positive effects on alleviating local protection issues. It will help develop regional and national distribution centres that are more spec ialised in distributi on rather than promoting pharmaceutical products. Under these circumstances, the distribution process would be more transparent, and regulation of the distribution would be made easier. Key messages and remaining gaps Historically, China's drug distribution chain was fragmented and characterised by high mark -ups. In 2016, China launched a 'dual-invoice' system pilot to reduce the number of distributors between manufacturers and hospitals and to provide greater transpare ncy to the drug distribution chain. The system is expected to be implemented across all public hospitals by the end of 2018 and will need to be monitored closely to assess its impact. While the dual -invoice policy could change the existing distribution str ucture and help develop large -scale regional and national distributors, it would do little to reduce prices . The remaining gap would be to address the issue that hospitals have the economic incentive to profit from drug sales. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 49 5.1.3. Prospective payment systems (PPS) A number of studies attribute Chi na's history of overprescribing to the payment models and financial incentives that dictate health care providers income at all levels of health care facilities (S. Zhang et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2016; Mao et al. 2015; Y. Gong et al. 2016) . Prior to 2009, healthcare providers were able to mark -up the price of pharmaceuticals and as a result derive a significant por tion of their income from pharmaceutica l sales. The 2009 reform attempted to decouple physician income from drug sales by eliminating drug mark -ups and in return providing additional government funding and higher payments for other health services. Despite additional government funding, many he alth facilities reported a substantial decrease in revenue following the 2009 healthcare reforms. Further, given the insufficient government subsidy to account for lost revenue, health care providers have looked for o ther means of compensating for their lo ss of income, resulting in a doubling of inpatient services use (H. Yi et al. 2015) . Currently, health care facilities across China are reimbursed retrospectively for the services they provide, in what is typically referred to as a fee -for-service payment model. Insufficient government funding has led medical departme nts to set specific revenue targets, th ereby incentivizing doctors to overprovide health services (Yang 2016) . Alternatively, gove rnments may wish to structure healthcare payments based on a prospective system, whereby all revenue is fixed prior to the provision of services. This may be done on a per -patient basis through capitation models where healthcare providers are payed a fixed amount for each patient they see, through global budgets where the total budget for a healthcare facility is fixed, or through salaries where physicians are paid a fixed amount either monthly or annually, independent of services provided. In theory , these three payment models decouple physician income from the services they provide. However, if structured incorrectly, prospective payment systems can incentivize cost -shifting or cream skimming, whereby physicians only choose to treat less expensive patients and shift expensive patients to other health facilities, in an attempt to lower costs. Many prospective payment models therefore include performance bonuses to further incentivize rational provider behaviour (S. Y. Tan and Melendez -Torres 2018) . While a comprehensive pay for performance model has not been implemented across China yet, several prospective payment system (PPS) pilots have taken place over the past few decades. Table 7 summarises th e results of these initiatives. Table 7.

Decrease in length of stay Source: (S. Y. Tan and Melendez -Torres 2018) . While the results of PPS pilots were mixed, some general trends emerge. PPS implementation in China successfully reduced total costs per admission and specifically dr ug cost per admission. However, some of these costs are being shifted from lower levels of health facilities to higher levels. While it is unclear what impact this cost shifting has on patient outcomes, quality assurance mechanism and clinical guidance are likely needed alongside these payment models to ensure that patients with poor prognosis are still receiving adequate care (S. Y. Tan and Melendez -Torres 2018) . Beyond capitation, salary, and gl obal budget PPS, hospitals can also bundle payment by disease area through Diagnosis -Related Group systems (DRG). DRG sys tems classify hospital cases in to specific diagnosis -related groups with fixed levels of reimbursement. The fee reimbursed for each ca se is fixed regardless of costs incurred. Interviewees suggest that wisespread implementation of a DRG -based system is li mited by poor linkage and sharing of patient data across healthcare facilities. Hospitals typically have independent electronic health record systems. Often hospitals may not recognize test results brought by patients that were provided by another hospital . Further, provider code diagnoses in different ways, creating a barrier to implementation of a universal DRG -system. \"There are a mix of different payment methods at present. Some are paid for by day, for instance, nursing homes. Dialysis is paid for by person -times. Others are paid for by cases. But overall, it is the simplest to have global budget control, from the perspective of health insurance funds. The budget is set based on some historical numbers; anything over the budget is not p aid by insurance or shared by the hospital and insurance. D RG pilots have been going on for three years. The pilots varied a lot across regions. It is still a trial at this stage. Wide implementation nationwide is going to take some time, or nearly impossi ble. Government is still advoc ating a mix of different payment methods.\" - Leading academic expert Pharmaceutical Policy in China 52 As part of the 2 017 healthcare reform policy, the State Council once again highlighted the de - linkage of hospital funding from drug sales as a priority. The 2017 reforms reiterate that prescriptions must be made by generic name, and have s tipulated that local health and f amily planning departments set healthcare expenditure growth targets. In this context, medical institutions will be provided with targets linked to government subsidies and performance evaluation in order to help control ir rational growth. Further, the Sta te Council intends to reform the basic medical insurance payment model to a prospective system, with funding fixed at disease level and supplemented with capitation schemes, thereby delinking hospital revenue from drug and diagnostic use. However, the spec ific details and timeline for implementation of this reform remain unclear (State C ouncil 2017) . 5.1.4. Generic Substitution In 2007, the prescription management ordinance was introduced which indicated that all prescriptions must be made by International Nonproprietary Name (INN). However, it appears there has been very little enforcement of this regulation as physicians typically prescribe by INN and simultaneously indicate the desired manufacturer or brand name. Further a disconnect is present between the prescription management ordinance and hospital IT syst ems which tend to list products a ccording to brand name (Wenjie Zeng et al. 2015) . Prescribing by bran d name, when equivalent generics are available, represents a substantial source of inefficiency. One study, which investigated the use of branded vs generic versions of proton pump inhibitors, reported that total expenditure could have been reduced by 84% \"A lot of this is down to habit. It's difficult to change physicians' prescribing habits ---they've been using brand names for years. And often the hospital IT system doesn't facilitate prescribing by generic names in its supposed sense. There would be two or three brand names listed under eac h generic name, and then the system would require the physician to select one. They would have to let the pharmacy know in this way which brand name was prescribed . \" - Pharmacy Director at a hospital Key messages and remaining gaps The current fee -for-service model of reimbursement in China likely incentivises over - prescribing and ov er-utilisation of health services. Targeted poli cies such as the zero-mark-up have led to cost -shifting from pharmaceuticals to other health services and overall health expenditure in China continues to rise. The use of prospective payment models has been explored in several contexts with mixed results . Applying a prospective payment model such as global budgeting or capitation, generally reduces total cost per admission and drug cost per admission. However, some evidence reports that PPS incentivises cost-shifting which raises concerns about the qualit y of care. Differences in electronic health record systems represent a significant barrier to implementation of a universal DRG -payment model. Providing the right incentives is key to the design of payment systems. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 53 between 2004 and 2012 with improved generic substitution (Wenjie Zeng et al. 2015) . Substantial loss of potential savings are also noted for prescriptions of statins, angiotensin inhibitors and TCMs, where generic utilisation levels range between 20 and 34% of total utilisation (W. Zeng et al. 2015) . Fundamentally, the difficulty of enforcement of prescribing by brand name comes from a number of sources: 1) different brand name drugs under the same generic name are, at least perceptually, of different quality; 2) physicians may receive f inancial incentives from drug manufacturers to disproportionately prescribe certain brand names; 3) pharmacies do not have the autonomy of choosing from substitute generics. In addition to poor enforcement of the prescription management ordinance, poor pe rceptions of the quality of generic medicines also presents a barrier to im proved utilisation of generics. While reforms in equivalence regulation will help to address this issue, a long history of poor generic quality and misconceptions that higher priced products are associated with greater efficacy remain (J. Sun et al. 2018) . Strengthening the use of generic medicines in China, partic ularly for essential medicines, is a key goal of the 13th FYP (NDRC 2016b) . Recently, the NDRC issued a Departmental Work Plan of the Opinions for Promotion of Healthy Development of the Pharmaceutical Industry. This notice reiterates that healthcare professionals are requ ired to write prescriptions using only generic drug names (NDRC 2016a) . 5.1.5. Clinical guidelines In 20 15, the NHFPC established the National Center for Medical Service Administration. Once of the key functions of this agency is to promote quality of care and to greater use of clinical guidelines. The agency is currently working in collaboration with t he WH O Collaborating Centre for Guideline Implementation and Knowledge Translation. Historically, the use of clinical guidelines in China has been highly variable. China is unique in its use of both Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicines. Guide lines must be able to help provider employ evidence based decision making across both types of medicines . With appropriate implementation and uptake, clinical guidelines can help reduce variability of care across settings (Chen 2018) . Key messages and remaining gaps Health care providers have largely circumvented the prescription management ordinance implemented in 2007, which requires prescribing by INN. Poor perceptions about the quality of generic products remain across both healthcare providers and patients. As a result, overall util isation of generic products remains low. It is too early to determine what the impact of the 2016 amendments to the Drug Registration Regulation will be, as the review process for re -registration is on -going. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 54 The publication of clinica l guidelines has increased annually in China, from less than 50 in 2010 to over 120 in 2016. However, the quality of Chinese guidelines is typically lower than those from other developed countries, with significantly fewer overall cit ations and fewer Cochr ane review citations. (Yu and Xu 2015; Zheng et al. 2015; Y un Gong 2016; J. Huang et al. 2015; Wu, He, and Mao 2016; Dai et al. 2015; Xi. Yi et al. 2018; Zhuolin Su n, Ding, and Li 2017; H. Tan et al. 2016) . Evidence on dissemination, implementation and adherence to guidelines in China is extremely limited. One st udy showed adherence rates to guidelines on TCMs was approximately 50%, while another showed adherence rates of 20 -40% for the treatment of gout (Liu et al. 2017, Sheng et al. 2014). Feedback from interviewees suggest many of these guidelin es are based on consensus and lack scientific rigour. Adherence to guidelines generally is much lower among low -tier healthcare providers due to lack of awareness. Access is another major issue among these practitioners. Improvements in the quality and im plementation of clinical guidelines in China will require a coordinated and systematic approach. Existing guidelines should be comprehensively reviewed before developing new guidelines. Guidelines should be tailored to local needs, recognising that diagnos tic criteria and treatments used in Western countries may not apply perfectly within China. National standards should be established for guideline methodology, quality, and implementation in order to promote effective dissemination and adherence. Finally, enhanced interna tional communication and collaboration will play a key role in sharing best -practices and promoting the development and use of high quality guidelines (Chen 2018). 5.1.6. Disease Specific Initiatives While the zero mark -up policy has only had marginal impacts o n levels of inappropriate prescribing, more targeted initiatives may have been more successful. In 2011, the Chinese government implemented a National Action Plan for Antibiotic Stewardship providing both administrative and professional strategies for guid ing antibiotic prescriptions (Figure 8). Under the ac tion plan, antibiotics are categorized under three groups: 1) non -restricted, 2) restricted, and 3) controlled. Health workers in village clinics are only permitted to provide non -restricted antibiotics, and must obtain approval from county health bureaux for intravenous infusions. Restricted antibiotics, and controlled antibiotics are limited to secondary and tertiary hospitals. Clinical guidelines were issued on the clinical conditions and evidence requ ired to justify antibiotic use. Prescriptions are aud ited on a regular basis according to these guidelines. Institutions violating rules may be downgraded or may be required to dismiss managers, or medical practitioners may lose permission to prescribe ant ibiotics (Tang et al. 2018; Bao et al. 2015) . Key messages and remaining gaps Both the avai lability and adherence clini cal guidelines is highly variable within China. Guidelines often lack scientific rigour, which limits their implementation. A formalised national guideline system is needed to improve the use of clinical guidelines in China. Th e establishment of the Natio nal Center for Medical Service Administration is a positive step, but it's impact thus far is unclear. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 55 Figure 8 - Case Study - National Action Plan for Antibiotic Stewardship (Source: The authors, adapted from Tang et al. 2018 & Bao et al. 2015) The national action plan for antibiotic stewardship was associated with a statistically significant reduction in total costs for non -restricted oral antibiotics and f or injectable antibiotics, as well as a decline in the total volume of antibiotic injectables between 2011 and 2013 (Tang et al . 2018; Bao et al. 2015) . However, some challenges remain as many health facilities lack the laboratory equipment to properly follow guidelines, forcing physicians to prescribe according to experience. Further, lack of inpatient beds and overcrowding al so contributes to inappropriate prescribing. Enforcement issues are noted at all levels of care (T. Zhang, Graham, and White 2018) . Some pharmaceutical policies in this area are conditioned by higher -level policies. For instance, poverty alleviation has been a policy focus in a broad context. Reflected in pharmaceutical policy, this results in some disease -specific initiatives that tar get socio -economically disadvantaged individuals. For instance, in 2017, NHC set up a hypertension management office at the National Results Substantial r eduction in total costs for non -restricted antibiotics, injectable antibiotics, and decline in total vo lume of antibiotic injectables National Action Plan for Antibiotic Stewardship (2011) Objectives 1.Reduce percentage of prescriptions with antibiotics to under 60% for hospitalized patients and 20% for outpatients. 2.Reduce intensity of antibiotic consumpti on to below 40 DDD/100 bed -days. 3.Reduce proportion of patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis for clean surgeries to below 30% 4.Establish guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis administration (30 -120 minutes prior t o surgical incision, with the duration o f prophylaxis limited to 24 hours) New Antibiotic Categorization Non-restricted : First -line antibiotics with proven efficacy, low price and little effect on antibiotic resistance Restricted : second -line antibiotics with higher price and higher risk of contributing to antibiotic resistance Controlled : antibiotics with known adverse events and high tendency to cause antibiotic resistance Drug Management Committees Establishment of a functional infectious disease dep artment, working in collaboration with cli nical pharmacists and other providers involved in infection control Provider training National education programs launched for healthcare providers and managers Enforcement Chief administrators of hospitals are responsible for patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness of antibiotic utilisation. Institutions violating rules downgraded or may lose permission to prescribe antibiotics Pharmaceutical Policy in China 56 Center for Cardiovascular Diseases. The objectives are to establish hypertension clinical guidelines for primary care insti tutions, building capacity for hypertension management at primary care l evels, and monitor prescribing at these institutions. One specific task of this office is to estimate the cost of free hypertensive drugs dispensed to poor individuals in rural areas, coupled with prescription audits, regular monitoring and tracking of the se patients. Strengthening China's weak primary care system is a long -term task, and would require a system of such policies to build capacity and improve its professional abilities. Key messages and remaining gaps The Chinese government has made appropriate prescribing and use of antibiotics a key national h ealth priority. Historically, levels of antibiotic prescribing in China were well above WHO recommended levels, and China has faced significant global criticism for their contribution towards antibiotic resistance. The National action plan for antibiotic stewardship provided several key administrative and professional strategies for guiding the prescription and use of antibiotics. The plan was associated with a significant improvement in antibiotic prescribing. However, some primary health facilities lacke d equipment to properly follow guidelines, and enforcement was inconsistent across all levels of care. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 57 5.2. Demand -side policies 5.2.1. Cost-sharing Demand -side policies aim to infl uence patient behaviour and encourage rational use of health services. In the year 2000, only 15% of the population in China was covered under health insurance, and for most, utilisation of health services was often associated with catastrophic expenditure (Hsiao, Li, and Zhang 2015) . Until recently, there have been three key health insurance plans which have operated to provide universal coverage to the Chinese population. The UEBMI insurance plan was first established in 1998 for urban formally employed residents, the NCMS was subsequently established in 2003 to provide rudimentary coverage for rural populations, and, in 2007, the URBMI was established for urban residents with out formal education (Chai et al. 2018, 201) . Since their inception, all three schemes have gone through significant changes in terms of their size, number of serv ices covered, and percentage of costs covered (Kaplan et al. 2017) . In particular, as part of the 2009 healthcare reforms, the Chinese govern ment committed an additional USD 124 billion in public spending over three years in order to expand population coverage, through one of the three schemes, to over 90%. Target subsidies were set for both urban and rural residents not currently covered, with the aim of close 90% of premiums for poorer areas in Western China, and up 70% in wealthier coastal regions. Between 2009 and 2011, the premium paid by governments rose from 80 RMB to 200 RMB. Further, complimentary medical assistance programmes were esta blished to cover the remaining out -of- pocket fees for particularly poor families. In order to encourage enrolment, targets were set for village and community leaders as part of their pe rformance measurement for future promotion (Hsiao, Li, and Zhang 2015) . Prior to 2009, the NCMS and URBMI only covered inpatient services. In an effort to strengthen the prima ry care system, coverage for outpatient services through the NCMS and U RBMI were gradually expanded. By the end of 2011, over 95% of the population in China was covered through one of the three insurance schemes. However, patients in the NCMS or URBMI sti ll paid upwards of 50% of their costs for outpatient and inpatient serv ices as reimbursement ceilings are present across all patients. Further, significant disparities existed in the amount of funding and coverage between the urban UEBMI scheme and the URB MI and NCMS schemes. In an attempt to provide a unified coverage and to improve risk and fund pooling, the Chinese government has recently announced it intends to merge the three insurance programmes (Kaplan et al. 2017) . \"The health reforms paid a lot of attention to prices, but not on volumes. In practice, there is a lot of unrea sonable use, a waste of health resources. This is a major reason why drug expenditures in China remain so high.\" - Leading academic expert Pharmaceutical Policy in China 58 While patient co -payments remain high, expansion of coverage as part of the 2009 healthcare reforms ha ve resulted in a significant increase in the u se of health care, particularly amongst poor populations. However, health utilisation has also increased in urban areas, and OOP spending has also been reported to have increased in these regions (Hsiao, Li, and Zhang 2015) . 5.2.2. Patient education One of the key contributing factors to irrational use of medicines in China is patient health literacy, particularly surrounding the use of a ntibiotics, injectable, and generic products (Mao et al. 2015; J. Sun et al. 2018; Dyar et al. 2018; H. Chen et al. 2018) . Prevailing attitudes around these products are tha t antibiotics are a cure -all, that injectable have improved efficacy over orally administered drugs, and that generic products, particularly low -priced generic products, are inferior to branded medicines. While physicians are often in a position to prescri be appropriately, patient demand often influen ces prescribing behaviour. In particular, primary care doctors are more likely to acquiesce to patient demands, given competition across primary care facilities and the risk of losing patients to other practice s (J. Sun et al. 2018) . Overall, these perceptions contribut e to a substantial source of inefficiency in t he Chinese pharmaceutical sector (W. Zeng et al. 2015; J. Zeng et al. 2015) . No studies were identified that evaluated the impact of a targeted patient education programme for improving rational use of antibiotic, gene ric, or injectable medicines. As such, the abi lity of patient education programmes to change perceptions and improve the rational use of medicines in the Chinese context remains unclear. Key messages and remaining gaps China has taken significant strides towards universal health coverage following the 2009 reforms, and the utilisation of heal th services has increased substantially, particularly in rural areas. Cost-sharing remains high and the package of services reimbursed is limited. The ability of health insurance to promote access to medicines is limited by the implementation of reimburs ement ceilings. Disparities remain across provinces, and across urban and rural residents. It is too early to determine what impact merging the three health insurance plans will have on reducing these disparities. Additional work is needed to determine h ow levels of cost-sharing vary across regions and the extent to which cu rrent levels of cost - sharing discourage the use of health services, particularly in vulnerable populations. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 59 Beyond irrational use of medicines, patient education also plays a k ey role in the management of chronic diseases. In this context, patient education programmes often aim to limit acute exacerbations of t he diseases. From an efficiency standpoint, this plays a critical role as avoidable acute exacerbations often result in extended hospital stays or use of outpatient services. In a pilot of a digital health coaching programme, patients reported statisticall y significant improvement in quality of life through participation in health coaching and a reduction in health services use. Some variability was noted across disease areas, with Rheumatoid Arthritis patients reporting the highest improvements (Burton et al. 2018) . Key messages and remaining gaps Poor patient health literacy has been a key contributor towards issues of inappr opriate use of medicines in China. Based on the evidence collected, it is unclear how the issue of patient health literacy is being addressed within China. Patient education can play a key role in managing chronic diseases, improving patient outcomes and reducing avoidable costs from acute exacerbations. Pharmaceutical Policy in China 60 Because of the 2009 reforms, China has made substantial progress in improving its health system in a short peri od of time; most notably, it has achieved near -universal coverage of health insurance, it has established the EML and it has lowered prices for these drugs. Nonetheless, many challenges still exist in the Chinese pharmaceutical sector, from R&D, to manufac turing, distribution, and dispensing of drugs on the supply side, and irrational prescription and use on the demand side. 5.3. HTA and negotiations Currently, HTA application is fragmented, sporadic and not fully embedded in the policy making process in China. While decision makers are aware of HTA, it is not mandatory. Recent reforms and changes to the national reimbursed drug list (NRDL) in 2016/2017 suggest that China is eager to move towards a more evidence -based pricing and reimbursement system. In 2016/201 7, as part of the most recent update of the NRDL, The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS) employed an ev idence -based, value -driven approach (previously the approach was passive without scientific input). Specifically, focus was placed on areas of serious disease, paediatric medications, medications for work -related accidents, and TCMs. Despite the update, se veral expensive but innovative and potentially life -saving products are excluded from the formulary, thereby restricting access for patients able to pay out -of-pocket. As a result, the central government initiated a pilot project in 2017, whereby pharmaceu tical companies were invited to submit evidence dossiers in order to inform a subsequent price negotiation. Agreements were reached for 36 out of 44 high -priced innovative medicines, and these were subsequently added to the NRDL. In order to continue to pr omote rational use of medicines, this process will need to be formalized through legislation, with clarity on submission processes and requirements, product eligibility, types of evidence considered, and evaluation processes and timelines. In October 2018, China established National Pharmaceutical and Health Technology Assessment Center , however it remains unclear how HTA will be inte grated in the decision making process. Interviews with key opinion leaders suggest the HTA will likely play more of an advisory role to begin with and will be taken into consideration as part of the price negotiation process. This role will need to be expl icitly defined, along with clear guidelines for the HTA scope and evaluation criteria. 5.4. Pharmaceutical prici ng Despite recent successes with the negotiation pilot, improvements are still needed in pharmaceutical pricing for both originator and generic pro ducts. Medicine expenditure in public hospitals has been controlled since 2009, with price cutting, zero mark -up policies and dual invoicing featuring as key cost -containment initiatives. While implementation of these initiatives has continued to grow, the se efforts are largely undermined by poor utilisation of generic products. Prior to 2015, generic products we re subject to extensive price ceilings and cuts, while at the same time suffering from quality issues, resulting in originator products maintaining price monopolies after loss of market exclusivity. Abolishment of price ceilings in 2015 has helped alleviat e this somewhat, but under -utilisation of generics remains an issue. While tendering helps to drive down prices, the current model of reimbursement fails to adequately promote generic use. Switching from a fixed percentage reimbursement rate model to a tie red-co-payment model with full reimbursement for generics (set based on internal reference pricing), will likely help to Pharmaceutical Policy in China 61 alleviate some of these is sues. Specific drug approval and pricing p olicy measures also need to be in place to ensure generic drugs are of good quality. In terms of in-patent products, while the goal may ultimately be to move towards an evidence -based system with HTA and pricing negotiations for innovative and expensive products, external reference pricing can provide a reasonable stop -gap until capacity in this area is built. 5.5. Generic policy Poor utilisation of generic products is a significant source of inefficiency in the Chinese health system. Reforms to the Drug Registration Regulation in 2016, require all generic fi rms to re - ensure the interchangeability of their products, moving closer towards international standards. This is intended not only to improve the perception of gene ric drugs in health care providers and patients within China, but also internationally give n the large number of domestic generic manufacturers. Evidence from literature suggests that this process has been time -intensive and opaque. More resources are requ ired to strengthen the review team , and improved coordination with regulatory authorities i s needed. Overcoming widespread perceptions that generic products are inferior to branded products will require additional initiatives targeting both healthcare professionals and patients through training workshops, public awareness campaigns and other patient education initiatives. Once the quality of generics is confirmed, INN prescribing or mandatory generic substitution should be considered. 5.6. Healthcare provider p ayment models (PPS) PPS are the most direct ways to providing incentives to guide provider behaviors. Currently, China still operates predominantly on a retrospective fee -for-service payment model. While implementation of the zero mark -up policy has helped to reduce the incentive to overprescribe medicines, rates of over -prescribing and inappropriate presc ribing, particularly in the context of antibiotics and injections, remain high relative to WHO recommendations for low and middle income countries . In par ticular, levels of inappropriate prescribing tend to be higher in primary care where patients have gre ater choice and ability to move practices, resulting in a tendency for physicians to be more compliant with patient demands. Further, rates of inappropria te prescribing are lower in healthcare professionals with higher levels of training. Evidence from literature suggests that prospective payment models, such as salary, capitation, and global budgets , can help to reduce over -prescribing and improve rational use of medicines. Several pilots have been carried out within China involving the implementation of p rospective payment models in both in -patient and out -patient settings. Recent policy reforms point to a case -based payment system, but the system may be oversimplified, and new problems emerge as to \"gaming the system\", such as reducing the length of patie nt stays, increasing readmissions, and admitting outpatients who do not need to be hospitalized. While the results have been variable, in general PPS redu ced health expenditures on both the supply and demand side, as well as length of stay and readmission rates. By providing the correct incentives, PPS generally improved service quality outcomes by r educing the likelihood or percentage of physicians prescr ibing unnecessary drugs or diagnostic procedures. Greater implementation of PPS throughout China may help to further reduce irrational prescribing , however careful monitoring is needed to ensure qual ity of services does not decline. Future effort in this a rea should focus Pharmaceutical Policy in China 62 on refining the specifics of payment methods with better data. In addition , initiatives that aim to improve health literacy in both health care professionals and patients are also re quired. 5.7. Healthcare financing and primary care One of th e key priorities of the 2009 health reforms was to improve equitable access to medicines. This priority has been reiterated in the 13th FYP. While near universal coverage has been achieved, the extent of coverage varied considerably from urban to rural set tings. Of the three health insurance programmes (UEBMI, URBMI, and NCMS), levels of coverage were considerably lower for NCMS. In order to p rovide a more unified coverage, China announced plans to merge the three programmes, however it still too early to d etermine if this will help to alleviate access issues in rural settings. The enactment of the EML policy since 2009 has in general improved access to essential medicines. It requires all primary healthcare facilities to stock and sell essential drugs. But implementation is faced with great challenges, and marked inefficiencies still exist in distributing essential drugs to patients. Many prima ry care institutions still do not have an adequate stock of essential drugs: a national -scale survey in 2016 found that 8% of primary care facilities do not stock any anti -hypertensive drugs, especially in poor rural areas (Su et al. 2017) . Moreover, only 33% stock low -cost high -value anti -hypertensive drugs. There is much to be done on extending the coverage of essential drugs, improving drug procurement and distrib ution, and low ering financial burdens on patients, to ensure equitable access to essential medicines (Q. Yao et al. 2014; Guan et al. 2015) . In addition, problems persist i n funding healthcare following the 2009 health reforms. Removal of income from mark - ups has not been adequately replaced through government subsidies. In part icular, village doctors have reported loss of income and increased dissatisfaction with work. Repo rts have emerged that doctors are secretly implementing mark -ups to supplement their income. While unification of health insurance programmes may help improve access to medicines in rural settings, increases in government subsidies and financing and streng thening of the weak rural healthcare system will also be required to address shortages in physician income structure. Boosting the primary care quality, parti cularly through training workforce and attracting talent to primary care institutions, will gradua lly change patients' perception of poor care quality associated with these healthcare facilities and encourage them to utilize community healthcare resources more efficiently.

The CFDA recently promised to create a system for rapid evaluation of innovative drugs for HIV/AIDS, cancer, m ajor chronic diseases, orphan diseases, and drugs with high potential budget impact. How would this compare to the existing fast -track approval? What changes have been made? 3. What is the mechanism for fast -tracking priority medicines? Do these products jump the queue for review, face a shorter review time, or do they receive conditional authorisation on the basis of premature clinical evidence? 4. How has verification review been used in the context of drug approvals in China? Which overseas agencies are refere nced in this process? By how much is drug approval accelerated through verification review? 5. The 2015 reforms in bioequivalence aimed to clear the backlog by the end of 2016 and to have approvals follow set timelines by 2018. Has this goal been achieved? Wh at barriers and challenges remain for this target to be achieved? 6. What regulations are in place governing the u se of medicines that have yet to be authorised by the CDA? Evidence suggests patients are illegally importing generic versions of innovative prod ucts that are pending approval in China. How has this problem been perceived within China? Has the problem wors ened/remained the same, or improved in recent years? What steps have been taken to address this issue? 7. The NRDL is only updated every 3 years. H ow is drug approval integrated with pricing and reimbursement in China? 8. What changes do you anticipate in the next 5 years in drug approval within China? Pricing and reimbursement stakeholder 1. Have the goals of the national essential medicines programme b een achieved? Is the zero mark -up policy applied universally or do some health care facilities still mark -up medicines? Reports suggest the zero mark -up policy was being extended beyond essential medicines to other products on the NRDL. To what extent has the ZMU been applied throughout various levels of health care? 2. Have there been any unintended consequences of t he zero mark -up policy? Are there any issues present in terms health facilities closing or downsizing staff due to loss of revenue?

How has the zer o mark -up policy been integrated with general health policy to address these issues? 3. How much does drug pricing vary from province to province? A re some provinces able to achieve significantly lower prices than others? In 2015, the state council issued a notice that aimed to create a more transparent and unified tendering process. Has this been achieved or are there still significant differences ac ross provinces in the tendering process? 4. Prior to 2015, the tendering process was criticised for prioritising p rice over quality. Have any quality assurance mechanisms been implemented in order to ensure that companies are not incentivised to lower quality in order to undercut prices? Pharmaceutical Policy in China 72 5. Another criticism of the tendering process related to the issuance of separate te nders for off -patent originators and generic versions of a product. Does this still occur in practice? If so, is this a priority area for reform? 6. The recent negotiations pilot successfully achieved agreements for 36 of 44 products, which entered into the N RDL.

Will all in -products proceed through negotiatio n to determine price, or will only a subset of products be eligible? If only a subset of products are eligible, what are t he eligibility criteria? 7. Tendering is the primary pricing mechanism for NRDL off -patent drugs and negotiations are the primary mechan ism for in -patent products. What proportion of products are priced through tendering? How are other products priced? Does this occur centrally, provincially, locally? 8. Health technology assessment is integrated within the negotiations pilot. Are there plans to formalise the use of HTA to help inform pricing and reimbursement decisions? What are the key barriers towards achiev ing this? Without a formal HTA system, how are drugs currently selected for inclusion on the NRDL? How do provinces inform their decisions to modify the NRDL? How do local hospitals inform their decisions on which products within the NRDL to procure? If pl ans are in place, can you provide information regarding evidence requirements, assessment timeline, and assessment criteria? 9. In 2015, the NDRC issued guidance for the implementation of external reference pricing? Has this been operationalized? Can you pro vide any details on this process? 10. What changes do you anticipate within the next 5 years for the pricing and reimbursement of medicine s within China? Hospital management stakeholder 1.

Do you conduct negotiations directly with manufacturers for the procurement of d rugs? If so is this for all products or a subset of products? 3. Does your facilities ever face issues with stocking essenti al drugs? Has the supply of drugs and funding been adequate? 4. What impact has the zero mark -up policy and essential medicines programme had at hospital level? Have revenues levels been adequately compensated through increases in government subsidies? If not , what were the consequences of decreased revenue? 5. To what extent does clinical guidance play a role in the prescribing of medicines? Is clinical guidance routinely disseminated from provincial or state level? Is it mandatory to follow clinical guidance? H ow do you monitor the extent to which clinical guidance is followed? 6. What is your view on the quality of generic products? Are they co nsidered to be bio - equivalent and interchangeable with originator products? Do you have any policies in place to promote g reater use of generic medicines? 7. In 2011, the Chinese government launched the National Action Plan for Antibiotic Stewardship. Has thi s initiative significantly impacted the way in which health care professionals prescribe antibiotics in your hospital? How frequently is your facility monitored to ensure they are complying with regulations on antibiotic use? Have doctors been able to mana ge patient expectations regarding antibiotics? Does your hospital have adequate equipment and facilities to follow guideli nes? Pharmaceutical Policy in China 73 8.
