Dr. Azzam, an obstetrician/gynecologist, has practiced medicine for nearly two decades in Canada and overseas and held senior administrative positions in health care, most recently in Manitoba. The 17 other new physicians - a combination of family physicians and specialists - take over existing practices or fill vacant positions within the provincial complement. \"I am incredibly excited for the opportunity to be part of the health care system on Prince Edward Island and part of the team at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital,\" Dr. Azzam said. \"I look forward to building on important work carried out by those who have previously held this role, ensuring that Islanders and their loved ones receive the best care and support when they come to us.\" Dr. Azzam, who started in his new role as QEH medical director earlier this week, will also remain clinically active with the obstetrics/gynecology service in Charlottetown. Among the other new physicians joining the province are neurologist Dr. Heather Williams and emergency medicine physicians Drs. Spencer Brown and Matt Twiddy, who fill new physician resources announced as part of government's balanced 2017-18 operating budget released in April. The province's Recruitment and Retention Secretariat works closely with Health PEI to identify and prioritize physician resource needs for the province. There are currently 246 physicians practicing across Prince Edward Island, 50 more than in 2006 and the most ever for the province.

Family medicine can also be difficult to recruit; however, programs such as the PEI Family Medicine Residency Training Program can help up-and-coming physicians start their medical careers within the province. The Recruitment and Retention Secretariat and Health PEI are currently recruiting to several physician opportunities within family medicine and other specialty areas. One family physician and a specialist have already committed to begin practicing in 2018 with several other physicians engaged in negotiations.
