Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is uncommon. It affects mostly infants < 18 months but can occur at any age. It involves a defect in targeted killing and the inhibitory controls of natural killer and cytotoxic T cells, resulting in excessive cytokine production and accumulation of activated T cells and macrophages in various organs. Cells in the bone marrow and/or spleen may attack red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets.

In both familial and acquired forms, clinical manifestations are similar. Symptoms and Signs of HLH Common manifestations of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis include fever, hepatomegaly, (eg, seizures, retinal hemorrhages, ataxia, altered consciousness or coma). Diagnosis of HLH Clinical and testing criteria Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can be diagnosed if there is a mutation in a known causative gene or if at least 5 of 8 diagnostic criteria based on HLH-2004 protocol ( [1](/en-pt/professional/hematology-and-oncology/histiocytic-syndromes/hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis-hlh#v60527520) [ Diagnosis reference Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon disorder causing immune dysfunction in infants and young children.

Genetic testing is recommended to look for primary HLH mutations as well as mutations that characterize immune dysregulation. Familial and acquired forms are differentiated only by family history.

Patients are usually treated by a pediatric hematologist and in a referral center experienced in treating patients with HLH. Treatment depends on the presence of factors such as a family history of HLH, coexisting infections, and demonstrated immune system defects. Treatment for HLH may include cytokine inhibitors, immune therapy, chemotherapy, some combination of these, and possibly [stem cell transplantation](/en-pt/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/transplantation/hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation) [ Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a rapidly evolving technique that offers a potential cure for hematologic cancers ( leukemias, lymphomas, myeloma) and other hematologic disorders... read more A response to early initiation of anakinra (IL1 antagonist) in patients with secondary HLH has been reported and may allow for avoidance of intensive chemotherapy but requires further investigation ( [1](/en-pt/professional/hematology-and-oncology/histiocytic-syndromes/hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis-hlh#v60527528) [ Treatment reference Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon disorder causing immune dysfunction in infants and young children.

Ruxolitinib (a JAK-STAT pathway inhibitor) for upfront treatment of HLH is being explored in a clinical trial sponsored by the North American Consortium for Histiocytosis (NACHO). Emapalumab, an interferon gamma-blocking monoclonal antibody, is available for patients with refractory, recurrent, or progressive HLH or with an intolerance to conventional therapy.

Pediatr Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon rare disorder and usually affects infants < 18 months. HLH can be familial (inherited) or acquired. Diagnose HLH if the patient has at least 5 of 8 published diagnostic criteria or if the patient has a known mutation associated with HLH. Treat with chemotherapy, cytokine inhibitors, immune suppression, and sometimes hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
