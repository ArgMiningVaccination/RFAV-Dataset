It contains inactivated virus of a strain which was originally derived by further serial passage of a proven [attenuated](https://www.rxlist.com/attenuated/definition.htm) strain. The virus is grown, harvested, purified by a combination of physical and high performance liquid chromatographic techniques developed at the Merck Research Laboratories, [formalin](https://www.rxlist.com/formalin/definition.htm) inactivated, and then adsorbed onto amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate. VAQTA is a sterile suspension for [intramuscular](https://www.rxlist.com/intramuscular_im/definition.htm) injection. One milliliter of the vaccine contains approximately 50U of [hepatitis](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis/definition.htm) A virus [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm), which is purified and formulated without a preservative. Within the limits of current assay variability, the 50U dose of VAQTA contains less than 0.1 mcg of non-viral protein, less than 4 x 10-6 mcg of DNA, less than 10-4 mcg of [bovine](https://www.rxlist.com/bovine/definition.htm) [albumin](https://www.rxlist.com/albumin/definition.htm), and less than 0.8 mcg of [formaldehyde](https://www.rxlist.com/formaldehyde/definition.htm). Other process chemical residuals are less than 10 parts per billion (ppb), including neomycin. Each 0.5-mL pediatric dose contains 25U of hepatitis A virus antigen and adsorbed onto approximately 0.225 mg of aluminum provided as amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate, and 35 mcg of sodium borate as a pH stabilizer, in 0.9% sodium chloride. Each 1-mL adult dose contains 50U of hepatitis A virus antigen and adsorbed onto approximately 0.45 mg of aluminum provided as amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate, and 70 mcg of sodium borate as a pH stabilizer, in 0.9% sodium chloride. INDICATIONS VAQTA\u00ae [Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated] is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by hepatitis A virus ( [HAV](https://www.rxlist.com/hav/definition.htm)) in persons 12 months of age and older. The primary dose should be given at least 2 weeks prior to expected exposure to HAV. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION FOR INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION ONLY. Dosage And Schedule Children/Adolescents (12 Months Through 18 Years Of Age) The [vaccination](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccination/definition.htm) schedule consists of a primary 0.5-mL dose administered intramuscularly, and a 0.5-mL booster dose administered intramuscularly 6 to 18 months later. Adults ( 19 Years Of Age) The vaccination schedule consists of a primary 1-mL dose administered intramuscularly, and a 1-mL booster dose administered intramuscularly 6 to 18 months later. Booster Immunization Following Another Manufacturer's Hepatitis A Vaccine A booster dose of VAQTA may be given at 6 to 12 months following a primary dose of [HAVRIX](https://www.rxlist.com/havrix/definition.htm) [see [Clinical Studies](/vaqta-drug.htm#CS)]. Preparation And Administration Shake the single-dose vial or single-dose prefilled syringe well to obtain a slightly opaque, white suspension before withdrawal and use. [Parenteral](https://www.rxlist.com/parenteral/definition.htm) drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Discard if the suspension does not appear homogenous or if extraneous particulate matter remains or discoloration is observed. For single-dose vials, withdraw and administer entire dose of VAQTA intramuscularly using a sterile needle and syringe. For single-dose prefilled syringes, securely attach a needle by twisting in a clockwise direction and administer dose of VAQTA intramuscularly. For adults, adolescents, and children older than 2 years of age, the [deltoid](https://www.rxlist.com/deltoid/definition.htm) muscle is the preferred site for intramuscular injection. For children 12 through 23 months of age, the anterolateral area of the thigh is the preferred site for intramuscular injection.

Manuf. and Dist. by : Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of MERCK & CO., INC., Whitehouse Station, NJ 08889, USA SIDE EFFECTS Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of VAQTA has been evaluated in over 10,000 subjects 1 year to 85 years of age. Subjects were given one or two doses of the vaccine. The second (booster dose) was given 6 months or more after the first dose. The most common local adverse reactions and systemic adverse events ( 15%) reported in different clinical trials across different age groups when VAQTA was administered alone or concomitantly were: - Children \u2014 12 through 23 months of age: injection-site pain/tenderness (37.0%), injection-site [erythema](https://www.rxlist.com/erythema/definition.htm)(21.2%), fever (16.4% and 27.0% when administered concomitantly). - Children/Adolescents \u2014 2 through 18 years of age: injection-site pain (18.7%) - Adults \u2014 19 years of age and older: injection-site pain, tenderness, or soreness (67.0%), injection-site warmth (18.2%) and headache (16.1%) Allergic Reactions Local and/or systemic allergic reactions that occurred in < 1% of over 10,000 children/adolescents or adults in clinical trials regardless of WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/vaqta-drug.htm#P)]. Children \u2014 12 through 23 Months of Age Across five clinical trials, 4374 children 12 to 23 months of age received one or two 25U doses of VAQTA, including 3885 children who received 2 doses of VAQTA and 1250 children who received VAQTA concomitantly with one or more other [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm), including [Measles](https://www.rxlist.com/measles/definition.htm), [Mumps](https://www.rxlist.com/mumps/definition.htm), and Rubella (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate, PedvaxHIB). Overall, the race distribution The distribution of subjects by gender was 51.8% male and 48.2% female. In an open-label clinical trial, 653 children 12 to 23 months of age were randomized to receive a first dose of VAQTA with ProQuad and Prevnar concomitantly (N=330) or a first dose of ProQuad and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine concomitantly, followed by a first dose of VAQTA 6 weeks later (N=323). Approximately 6 months later, subjects received either the second doses of ProQuad and VAQTA concomitantly or the second doses of ProQuad and VAQTA separately. The race distribution of the study The distribution of subjects by gender was 50.7% male and 49.3% female. Table 1 presents rates of solicited local reactions at the VAQTA injection site and rates of elevated temperatures ( 100.4\u00b0F and 102.2\u00b0F) that occurred within 5 days following each dose of VAQTA and elevated temperatures > 98.6\u00b0F for a total of 14 days after vaccination; occurrences of these events were recorded daily on diary cards.

All groups received the second dose of VAQTA alone at least 6 months following the first dose. The race distribution of Stage I study of subjects by gender was 54.0% male and 46.0% female. In Stage II of this study, an additional 654 children 12-17 months of age received the first dose of VAQTA alone followed by the second dose of VAQTA 6 months later. The race distribution of Stage II of the study of subjects by gender was 51.2% male and 48.8% female. Table 3 presents rates of solicited local reactions at the VAQTA injection-site and rates of elevated temperatures ( 100.4\u00b0F and 102.2\u00b0F) that occurred within 5 days following each dose of VAQTA and elevated temperatures > 98.6\u00b0F for a total of 14 days following each dose of VAQTA. Occurrences of these events were recorded daily on diary cards. Table 4 presents rates of unsolicited systemic adverse events that occurred within 14 days at 5% following each dose of VAQTA.

Across the five studies conducted in children 12-23 months of age, 39.9% of subjects experienced local adverse reactions and 55.7% of subjects experienced systemic adverse events. The majority of local and systemic adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. The following additional unsolicited local adverse reactions and systemic adverse events were observed at a common frequency of 1% to < 10% in any individual clinical study. This listing includes only the adverse reactions not reported elsewhere in the label. These local adverse reactions and systemic adverse events occurred among recipients of VAQTA alone or VAQTA given concomitantly within 14 days following any dose of VAQTA across four clinical studies. Eye disorders: [Conjunctivitis](https://www.rxlist.com/conjunctivitis/definition.htm) Gastrointestinal disorders: rash; varicella-like rash; rash morbilliform Serious Adverse Events (Children 12 through 23 Months of Age): Across the five studies conducted in subjects 12-23 months of age, 0.7% (32/4374) of subjects reported a serious adverse event following any dose of VAQTA, and 0.1% (5/4374) of subjects reported a serious adverse event judged to be vaccine related by the study investigator. The serious adverse events were collected over the period defined in each protocol (14, 28, or 42 days). Vaccine-related serious adverse events which occurred following any dose of VAQTA with or without concomitant vaccines (0.02%), and celluitis (0.02%). Children/Adolescents \u2014 2 Years through 18 Years of Age In 11 clinical trials, 2615 healthy children 2 years through 18 years of age received at least one dose of VAQTA. These studies included administration of VAQTA in varying doses and regimens (1377 children received one or more 25U doses).The race distribution of the study subjects who received at least one dose of VAQTA in these studies was subjects by gender was 51.2% male and 48.8% female. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial (i.e. The Monroe Efficacy Study), 1037 healthy children and adolescents 2 through 16 years of age.were randomized to receive a primary dose of 25U of VAQTA and a booster dose of VAQTA 6, 12, or 18 months later, or placebo (alum diluent). All study subjects were Caucasian: 51.5% were male and 48.5% were female Subjects were followed days 1 to 5 postvaccination for fever and local adverse reactions and days 1 to 14 for systemic adverse events. The most common adverse events/reactions were injection-site reactions, reported by 6.4% of subjects. Table 5 summarizes local adverse reactions and systemic adverse events reported in 1% of subjects. There were no significant differences in the rates of any adverse events or adverse reactions between vaccine and placebo recipients after Dose 1.

Adults \u2014 19 Years of Age and Older In an open-label clinical trial, 240 healthy adults 18 to 54 years of age were randomized to receive either VAQTA (50U/1-mL) with Typhim Vi3 (Typhoid fever vaccine) concomitantly (N=80), typhoid Vi polysaccharide and yellow fever vaccines concomitantly (N=80), or VAQTA alone (N=80). Approximately 6 months later, subjects who received VAQTA were administered a second dose of VAQTA. The race distribution of the study subjects who received VAQTA with or without typhoid Vi polysaccharide and yellow by gender was 40.8% male and 59.2% female. Subjects were monitored for local adverse reactions and fever for 5 days and systemic adverse events for 14 days after each vaccination. In the 14 days after the first dose of VAQTA, the proportion of subjects with adverse events was similar between recipients of VAQTA given concomitantly with typhoid Vi polysaccharide and yellow fever vaccines compared to recipients of typhoid Vi polysaccharide and yellow fever vaccines without VAQTA. Table 6 summarizes solicited local adverse reactions and Table 7 summarizes unsolicited systemic adverse events reported in 5% in adults who received one or two doses of VAQTA alone and for subjects who received VAQTA concomitantly with typhoid Vi polysaccharide and yellow fever vaccines. There were no solicited systemic complaints reported at a rate 5%. Fever 101\u00b0F occurred in 1.3% of subjects in each group.

In four clinical trials involving 1645 healthy adults 19 years of age and older who received one or more 50U doses of hepatitis A vaccine, subjects were followed for fever and local adverse reactions 1 to 5 days postvaccination and for systemic adverse events 1 to 14 days postvaccination. One single-blind study evaluated doses of VAQTA with varying amounts of viral antigen and/or alum content in healthy adults 170 pounds and 30 years of age (N=210 adults administered 50U/1-mL dose). One open-label study evaluated VAQTA given with immune globulin or alone (N=164 adults who received VAQTA alone). A third study was single-blind and evaluated 3 different lots of VAQTA (N=1112). The fourth study that was also single-blind evaluated doses of VAQTA with varying amounts of viral antigen in healthy adults 170 pounds and 30 years of age (N=159 adults administered the 50U/1-mL dose). Overall, the race distribution of the study subjects who received at least one dose of VAQTA subjects were male and 52.4% were female. The most common adverse event/reaction was injection-site pain/soreness/tenderness reported by 67.0% of subjects. Of all reported injection-site reactions 99.8% were mild (i.e., easily tolerated with no medical intervention) or moderate (i.e., minimally interfered with usual activity possibly requiring little medical intervention). Listed below in Table 8 are the local adverse reactions and systemic adverse events reported by 5% of subjects, in decreasing order of frequency within each body system.

Percent=percentage of subjects for whom data are available with adverse event. *Systemic Adverse Events reported Days 1 to 14 after vaccination, regardless of causality. Adverse Reactions at the injection site (VAQTA) and measured fever Days 1 to 5 after vaccination. The following additional unsolicited systemic adverse events were observed among recipients of VAQTA that occurred within 14 days at a common frequency of 1% to < 10% following any dose not reported elsewhere in the label. These adverse reactions have been reported across 4 clinical studies. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Back pain; stiffness Reproductive system and breast disorders: Menstruation disorders Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported with use of the marketed vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to a vaccine exposure. Blood and lymphatic a post-marketing, 60-day safety surveillance study, conducted at a large health maintenance organization in the United States, a total of 42,110 individuals 2 years of age received 1 or 2 doses of VAQTA (13,735 children/adolescents and 28,375 adult subjects). Safety was passively monitored by electronic search of the automated medical records database for emergency room and outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Medical charts were reviewed when an event was considered to be possibly vaccine-related by the investigator. None of the serious adverse events identified were assessed as being related to vaccine by the investigator. Diarrhea/gastroenteritis, resulting in outpatient visits, was determined by the investigator to be the only vaccine-related nonserious adverse reaction in the study. There was no vaccine-related adverse reaction identified that had not been reported in earlier clinical trials with VAQTA. DRUG INTERACTIONS Use With Other Vaccines Do not mix VAQTA with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial. Use separate injection sites and syringes for each vaccine. Please refer to package inserts of coadministered vaccines. In clinical trials in children, VAQTA was concomitantly administered with one or more of the following US licensed vaccines: Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine, (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate). Safety and immunogenicity were similar for concomitantly administered vaccines compared to separately administered vaccines. In clinical trials in adults, VAQTA was concomitantly administered with typhoid Vi polysaccharide and yellow fever vaccines [see ADVERSE REACTIONS and [Clinical Studies](/vaqta-drug.htm#CS)]. Safety and immunogenicity were similar for concomitantly administered vaccines compared to separately administered vaccines. Use With Immune Globulin VAQTA may be administered concomitantly with Immune Globulin, human, using separate sites and syringes. The recommended vaccination regimen for VAQTA should be followed. Consult the manufacturer's product circular for the appropriate dosage of Immune Globulin. A booster dose of VAQTA should be administered at the appropriate time as outlined in the recommended regimen for VAQTA [see [Clinical Studies](/vaqta-drug.htm#CS)]. Immunosuppressive Therapy If VAQTA is administered to a person receiving immunosuppressive therapy, an adequate immunologic response may not be obtained. WARNINGS Included as part of the PRECAUTIONS section. PRECAUTIONS Prevention And Management Of Allergic Vaccine Reactions Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of the vaccine [see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/vaqta-drug.htm#CI)]. Hypersensitivity To Latex The vial stopper and the syringe plunger stopper and tip cap contain dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions in latex-sensitive individuals [see [HOW SUPPLIED](/vaqta-drug.htm#HS)/Storage and Handling]. Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a diminished immune response to VAQTA and may not be protected against HAV infection after vaccination [see Use in Specific Populations]. Limitations Of Vaccine Effectiveness Hepatitis A virus has a relatively long incubation period (approximately 20 to 50 days). VAQTA may not prevent hepatitis A infection in individuals who have an unrecognized hepatitis A infection at the time of vaccination. Vaccination with VAQTA may not result in a protective response in all susceptible vaccinees. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility VAQTA has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or its potential to impair fertility. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with VAQTA. It is also not known whether VAQTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. VAQTA should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether VAQTA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when VAQTA is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety of VAQTA has been evaluated in 4374 children 12 through 23 months of age, and 2615 children/adolescents 2 through 18 years of age who received at least one 25U dose of VAQTA [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/vaqta-drug.htm#AR) and [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/vaqta-drug.htm#D)]. Safety and effectiveness in infants below 12 months of age have not been established. Geriatric Use In the post-marketing observational safety study which included 42,110 persons who received VAQTA [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/vaqta-drug.htm#AR)], 4769 persons were 65 years of age or older and 1073 persons were 75 years of age or older. There were no adverse events judged by the investigator to be vaccine-related in the geriatric study population. In other clinical studies, 68 subjects 65 years of age or older were vaccinated with VAQTA, 10 of whom were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety and immunogenicity were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; however, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. Immunocompromised Individuals Immunocompromised persons may have a diminished immune response to VAQTA and may not be protected against HAV infection. OVERDOSE No information provided. CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer VAQTA to individuals with a history of immediate and/or severe allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis A vaccine, or to individuals who have had an anaphylactic reaction to any component of VAQTA, including neomycin [see [DESCRIPTION](/vaqta-drug.htm#D)]. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action VAQTA has been shown to elicit antibodies to hepatitis A as measured by ELISA. Protection from hepatitis A disease has been shown to be related to the presence of antibody. However, the lowest titer needed to confer protection has not been determined. Clinical Studies Efficacy Of VAQTA: The Monroe Clinical Study The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of VAQTA were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 1037 susceptible healthy children and adolescents 2 through 16 years of age in a U.S. community with recurrent outbreaks of hepatitis A (The Monroe Efficacy Study). All of these children were Caucasian, and there were 51.5% male and 48.5% female. Each child received an intramuscular of VAQTA (25U) (N=519) or placebo (alum diluent) (N=518). Among those individuals who were initially seronegative (measured by a modification of the HAVAB radioimmunoassay [RIA]), seroconversion was achieved in > 99% of vaccine recipients within 4 weeks after vaccination. The onset of seroconversion following a single dose of VAQTA was shown to parallel the onset of protection against clinical hepatitis A disease. Because of the long incubation period of the disease (approximately 20 to 50 days, or longer in children), clinical efficacy was based on confirmed cases6 of hepatitis A occurring 50 days after vaccination in order to exclude any children incubating the infection before vaccination. In subjects who were initially seronegative, the protective efficacy of a single dose of VAQTA was observed to be 100% with 21 cases of clinically confirmed hepatitis A occurring in the placebo group and none in the vaccine group (p < 0.001). The number of clinically confirmed cases of hepatitis A 30 days after vaccination were also compared. In this analysis, 28 cases of clinically confirmed hepatitis A occurred in the placebo group while none occurred in the vaccine group 30 days after vaccination. In addition, it was observed in this trial that no cases of clinically confirmed hepatitis A occurred in the vaccine group after day 16.7 Following demonstration of protection with a single dose and termination of the study, a booster dose was administered to a subset of vaccinees 6, 12, or 18 months after the primary dose. No cases of clinically confirmed hepatitis A disease 50 days after vaccination have occurred in those vaccinees from The Monroe Efficacy Study monitored for up to 9 years. Other Clinical Studies The efficacy of VAQTA in other age groups was based upon immunogenicity measured 4 to 6 weeks following vaccination. VAQTA was found to be immunogenic in all age groups. Children \u2014 12 through 23 Months of Age In a clinical trial, children 12 through 23 months of age were randomized to receive the first dose of VAQTA with or without M-M-R II and VARIVAX (N=617) and the second dose of VAQTA with or without Tripedia and optionally either oral poliovirus vaccine (no longer licensed in the US) or IPOL(N=555). The race distribution of study subjects who received at least one dose of VAQTA of subjects by gender was 53.6% male and 46.4% female. In the analysis population, there were 471 initially seronegative children 12 through 23 months of age, who received the first dose of VAQTA with (N=237) or without (N=234) mIU/mL) post dose 1 with an anti-HAV GMT of 48 mIU/mL (95% CI: 44.7, 51.6). There were 343 children in the analysis population who received the second dose of VAQTA with (N=168) or without (N=175) Tripedia and optional (95% at both visits, 100% (n=97) seroconverted after the second dose of VAQTA. In a clinical trial involving 653 healthy children 12 to 15 months of age, 330 were randomized to receive VAQTA, ProQuad, and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine to receive ProQuad and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine concomitantly followed by VAQTA 6 weeks later. The race distribution of the study subjects was The distribution of subjects by gender was 50.7% male and 49.3% female. In the analysis population, the seropositivity rate for hepatitis A antibody (defined as the percent of subjects with an anti-HAV These seropositivity rates were similar whether VAQTA was administered with or without ProQuad and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine. In an open, multicenter, randomized study involving 617 children 15 months of age, 306 were randomized to receive VAQTA with or without PedvaxHIB and INFANRIX, and 311 were randomized to receive VAQTA with or without PedvaxHIB. The race distribution of the study subjects of subjects by gender was 54.0% male and 46.0% female. The seropositivity rate for hepatitis A antibody (defined as the percent of subjects with an anti-HAV titer 10 mIU/mL) 4 weeks 95% CI: 98.2%, 100.0%) with PedvaxHIB and INFANRIX or concomitantly with PedvaxHIB. In those subjects who received VAQTA alone, the seropositivity rate for hepatitis A antibody was 100% (n=183, 95% CI: 98.0%, 100.0%), serostatus. Overall, the anti-HAV GMT in 3996.8, 5556.8). Comparable were observed in both the initially seronegative and seropositive subjects. In three combined clinical studies 1022 initially seronegative subjects received 2 doses of VAQTA alone or concomitantly with other vaccines. Of the seronegative subjects, 99.9% dose 2 of VAQTA. Children/Adolescents \u2014 2 Years through 18 Years of Age Immunogenicity data were combined from eleven randomized clinical studies in children and adolescents 2 through 18 years of age who received VAQTA (25U/0.5 mL). These included administration of VAQTA in varying doses and regimens (N=404 received 25U/0.5 mL), the Monroe Efficacy Study (N=973), and comparison studies for process and formulation changes (N=1238). The race distribution of the study subjects who received at least one dose of VAQTA in these studies was subjects by gender was 51.2% male and 48.8% female. The proportions of subjects who seroconverted 4 weeks after the first and second doses administered 6 months apart were 10,810), respectively. Adults \u2014 19 Years of Age and Older Immunogenicity data were combined from five randomized clinical studies in adults 19 years of age and older who received VAQTA (50U/1-mL). One single-blind study evaluated doses of VAQTA with varying amounts of viral antigen and/or alum content in healthy adults 170 pounds and 30 years of age (N=208 adults administered 50U/1-mL dose). One open-label study evaluated VAQTA given with immune globulin or alone (N=164 adults who received VAQTA alone). A third study was single-blind and evaluated 3 different lots of VAQTA (N=1112). The fourth study was single-blind and evaluated doses of VAQTA with varying amounts of viral antigen in healthy adults 170 pounds and 30 years of age (N=159 adults administered the 50U/1-mL dose). The fifth study was an open-label study to evaluate various regimens for time of administration of the booster dose of VAQTA (6, 12, and 18 months post dose 1, N=354). The race distribution of the study subjects who received at least one dose of VAQTA in these studies of subjects by gender was 44.8% male and 55.2% female. The proportion of subjects who seroconverted 4 weeks after the first and second doses administered 6 months apart was of 16 mIU/mL after a single dose of VAQTA. Timing Of Booster Dose Administration Children/Adolescents \u2014 2 through 18 Years of Age In the Monroe Efficacy Study, children were administered a second dose of VAQTA (25U/0.5 mL) 6, 12, or 18 months following the initial dose. For subjects who received both doses of VAQTA, the GMTs and proportions of subjects who seroconverted 4 weeks after the booster dose administered 6, 12, and 18 months after the first dose are presented in Table 9. Table 9 : Children/Adolescents from the Monroe Efficacy Study Seroconversion Rates (%) and Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) for Cohorts of Initially Seronegative Vaccinees at the Time of the Booster (25U) and 4 Weeks Later |Months Following Initial 25U Dose||Cohort* | (n=960) 0 and 6 Months |Cohort* | (n=35) 0 and 12 Months |Cohort* | (n=39) Months prebooster and postbooster time points.| Adults \u2014 19 years of age and older Among the 5 randomized clinical studies in adults 19 years of age and older described in Section 14.2, there were additional data in which a booster dose of VAQTA (50U/1-mL) was administered 12 or 18 months after the first dose. For subjects in these studies who received both doses of VAQTA, the proportions who seroconverted 4 weeks after the booster dose administered 6, 12, and 18 months after the first dose were 100% of 1201 subjects, 98% of 91 subjects, and 100% of 84 subjects, respectively. GMTs in mIU/mL one month after the subjects received the booster dose at 6, 12, or 18 months after the primary dose Of Immune Response In follow-up of subjects in The Monroe Efficacy Study, in children ( 2 years of age) and adolescents who received two doses (25U) of VAQTA, detectable levels of anti-HAV antibodies ( 10 mIU/mL) were present in 100% of subjects for at least 10 years postvaccination. In subjects who received VAQTA at 0 and 6 months, the GMT was 819 mIU/mL (n=175) at 2.5 to 3.5 years and 505 mIU/mL (n=174) at 5 to 6 years, and 574 mIU/mL (n=114) at 10 years postvaccination. In subjects who received VAQTA at 0 and 12 months, the GMT was 2224 mIU/mL (n=49) at 2.5 to 3.5 years, 1191 mIU/mL (n=47) at 5 to 6 years, and 1005 mIU/mL (n=36) at 10 years postvaccination. In subjects who received VAQTA at 0 and 18 months, the GMT was 2501 mIU/mL (n=53) at 2.5 to 3.5 years, 1614 mIU/mL (n=56) at 5 to 6 years, and 1507 mIU/mL (n=41) at 10 years postvaccination. In adults that were administered VAQTA at 0 and 6 months, the hepatitis A antibody response to date has been shown to persist at least 6 years. Detectable levels of anti-HAV antibodies ( 10 mIU/mL) were present in 100% (378/378) of subjects with a GMT of 1734 mIU/mL at 1 year, 99.2% (252/254) of subjects with a GMT of 687 mIU/mL at 2 to 3 years, 99.1% (219/221) of subjects with a GMT of 605 mIU/mL at 4 years, and 99.4% (170/171) of subjects with a GMT of 684 mIU/mL at 6 years postvaccination. The total duration of the protective effect of VAQTA in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present. Concomitant Administration Of VAQTA and Immune Globulin The concurrent use of VAQTA (50U) and immune globulin (IG, 0.06 mL/kg) was evaluated in an open-label, randomized clinical study involving 294 healthy adults 18 to 39 years of age. Adults were randomized to receive 2 doses of VAQTA 24 weeks apart (N=129), the first dose of VAQTA concomitant with a dose of IG followed by the second dose of VAQTA alone 24 weeks later (N=135), or IG alone (N=30). The race distribution of the study subjects who received at least one dose of VAQTA or IG in this study subjects by gender was 28.7% male and 71.3% female. Table 10 provides seroconversion rates and geometric mean titers (GMTs) at 4 and 24 weeks after the first dose in each treatment group and at one month after a booster dose of VAQTA (administered at 24 weeks) [see [DRUG INTERACTIONS](/vaqta-drug.htm#DI)]. Table 10 : Seroconversion Rates (%) and Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) After Vaccination with VAQTA Plus IG, VAQTA Alone, in the group receiving VAQTA alone were significantly higher than in the group receiving VAQTA plus IG (p=0.05, p < 0.001, respectively). | Undetectable is defined as < 10mIU/mL. N/A = Not Applicable. Interchangeability Of The Booster Dose A randomized, double-blind clinical study in 537 healthy adults, 18 to 83 years of age, evaluated the [immune response](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_response/definition.htm) to a booster dose of VAQTA and HAVRIX given at 6 or 12 months following an initial dose of HAVRIX. Subjects were randomized to receive VAQTA (50U) as a booster dose 6 months (N=232) or 12 months (N=124) following an initial dose of HAVRIX or HAVRIX (1440 EL. U) as a booster dose 6 months (N=118) or 12 months (N=63) following an initial dose of HAVRIX. The race distribution of the study subjects who received the booster dose of VAQTA or HAVRIX in this subjects by gender was 44.9% male and 55.1% female. When VAQTA was given as a booster dose following HAVRIX, the vaccine produced an adequate immune response (see Table 11) [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/vaqta-drug.htm#D)]. Table 11 : Seropositivity Rate, Booster Response Rate* and Geometric Mean Titer 4 Weeks Following a Booster Dose of VAQTA or HAVRIX Administered 6 to 12 Months After First Dose of is defined as greater than or equal to a tenfold rise from prebooster to postbooster titer and postbooster titer 100 mIU/mL. | Study conducted in adults 18 years of age and older. Immune Response To Concomitantly Administered Vaccines Clinical Studies of VAQTA with M-M-R II, VARIVAX, and Tripedia In the clinical trial in which children 12 months of age received the first dose of VAQTA concomitantly with M-M-R II and VARIVAX described in Section 14.2, rates of seroprotection to hepatitis A were similar between the two groups who received VAQTA with or without M-M-R II and VARIVAX. Measles, mumps, and rubella immune responses were tested in 241 subjects, 263 subjects, and 270 subjects, respectively. Seropositivity rates similar to observed historical rates (seropositivity rates 99% for all three antigens, with lower bound of the 95% CI > 89%) following vaccination with a first dose of M-M-R II in this age group. Data from this study were insufficient to adequately assess the immune response to VARIVAX administered concomitantly with VAQTA. In this same study, the second dose of VAQTA at 18 months of age was given with or without Tripedia (DTaP). Seropositivity rates for diphtheria and tetanus were similar to those in historical controls. However, data from this study were insufficient to assess the pertussis response of DTaP when administered with VAQTA. Rates of seroprotection to hepatitis A were similar between the two groups who received VAQTA with or without M-M-R II and VARIVAX, and between the two groups who received VAQTA with or without DTaP. Clinical Studies of VAQTA with ProQuad and Prevnar In the clinical trial of concomitant use of VAQTA with ProQuad and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine in children 12 to 15 months of age described in Section 14.2, the antibody GMTs for S. pneumoniae types 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F 6 weeks after vaccination with pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly with ProQuad and VAQTA were non-inferior as compared to GMTs observed in the group given pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine with ProQuad alone (the lower bounds of the 95% CI around the fold-difference for the 7 serotypes excluded 0.5). For the varicella component of ProQuad, in subjects with baseline antibody titers < 1.25 gpELISA units/mL, the proportion with a titer 5 gpELISA units/mL 6 weeks after their first dose of ProQuad was non-inferior (defined as -10 percentage point change) when ProQuad was administered with VAQTA and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine as compared to the proportion with a titer 5 gpELISA units/mL when ProQuad was administered with CI: -9.3, -1.4%]). Hepatitis A responses were similar when compared between the two groups who received VAQTA with or without ProQuad and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine. rates and for S. pneumoniae types 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F were similar between groups at 6 weeks postvaccination. Clinical Studies of VAQTA with INFANRIX and PedvaxHIB In the clinical trial of concomitant administration of VAQTA with INFANRIX and PedvaxHIB in children 15 months of age, described in Section 14.2, when the first dose of VAQTA was administered concomitantly with either INFANRIX and PedvaxHIB or PedvaxHIB, there was no interference in immune response to hepatitis A as measured by seropositivity rates after dose 2 of VAQTA compared to administration of both doses of VAQTA alone. When dose 1 of VAQTA was administered concomitantly with either PedvaxHIB and INFANRIX or PedvaxHIB, there was no interference in immune response to Haemophilus influenzae b (as measured by the proportion of subjects who attained an anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate antibody titer > 1.0 mcg/mL at 4 weeks after vaccination), compared to subjects receiving either PedvaxHIB and INFANRIX or PedvaxHIB. When VAQTA was administered concomitantly with INFANRIX and PedvaxHIB, there was no interference in immune responses at 4 weeks after vaccination to the pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, or pertactin, as measured by GMTs) and no interference in immune responses to diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid (as measured by the proportion of subjects achieving an antibody titer > 0.1 IU/mL) compared to administration of INFANRIX and PedvaxHIB. Clinical Studies of VAQTA with Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine and Yellow Fever Vaccine, Live Attenuated In the clinical trial of concomitant use of VAQTA with typhoid Vi polysaccharide and yellow fever vaccines in adults 18-54 years of age described in Section 6.1, the antibody response rates for typhoid Vi polysaccharide and yellow fever were adequate when typhoid Vi polysaccharide and yellow fever vaccines were administered concomitantly with (N=80) and nonconcomitantly without VAQTA (N=80). The seropositivity rate for hepatitis A when VAQTA, typhoid Vi polysaccharide, and yellow fever vaccines were administered concomitantly was generally similar to when VAQTA was given alone [see [DRUG INTERACTIONS](/vaqta-drug.htm#DI)]. Data are insufficient to assess the immune response to VAQTA and [poliovirus](https://www.rxlist.com/poliovirus/definition.htm) vaccine when administered concomitantly. REFERENCES 6 The clinical case definition included all of the following occurring at the same time: 1) one or more typical clinical signs or symptoms of hepatitis A (e.g., [jaundice](https://www.rxlist.com/jaundice/definition.htm), [malaise](https://www.rxlist.com/malaise/definition.htm), fever 38.3\u00b0C); 2) elevation of hepatitis A [IgM](https://www.rxlist.com/igm/definition.htm) antibody (HAVAB-M); 3) elevation of [alanine](https://www.rxlist.com/alanine/definition.htm) transferase (ALT) 2 times the upper limit of normal. 7 One vaccinee did not meet the pre-defined criteria for clinically confirmed hepatitis A but did have positive hepatitis A IgM and borderline liver enzyme (ALT) elevations on days 34, 50, and 58 after vaccination with mild clinical symptoms observed on days 49 and 50.
