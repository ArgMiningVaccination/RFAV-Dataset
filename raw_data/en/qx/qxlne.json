Anxiety is a defensive ability to avoid danger that is essential to th e process of natural selection, helping the chance of survival. However, when anxiety and fear are excessive, lacking, or inadequate, adapta tion is difficult1,2. Continuous exposure to threats, fear, and anxiety are more likely to cause mental health problem s such as anxi - ety disorders and depression3. Therefore, it has been suggested that individuals need to develop t heir ability to cope with mental stress in advance4. In this context, mindfulness meditation is gaining attention for its ability to calm the hyperactivity that is increasingly common in modern society. Mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cogni - tive therapy (MBCT) have become widely accepted medical interven tions for anxiety disorders and depression in the recent decade5,6. However, these skills can take weeks and sometimes years to acquire. To addr ess this problem, a recent study aimed to facilitate the early acquisition o f mindfulness through the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)7. tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that uses a simple and ine xpensive device to modify neu - ronal excitability by delivering weak direct current, about 1-2 mA, through electrodes placed on the s calp8. In the last decade, tDCS has been the subject of an increasing number of papers published for both ba sic and clinical research8-12.OPEN 1Department of Neuropsychiatry, 570-8506, Japan. 2Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry, University of Bern, Bolligenstrasse 111, 3000 Bern, Switzerland. 3The KEY Institute for Brain-Mind Research, University Hospital of Psychiatry, Postfach 1931, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland. 4Graduate School of Osaka 541-0043, Japan. 6Department of Molecular-Targeting Cancer Prevention, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 3-2-17-2F Imabashi, Chuo-ku, Osaka, (2021) 11:22734 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02177-3www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In general, meditation can be divided into focused and insight meditation13. Focused meditation regulates the occurrence of mind-wandering. Mind-wandering is a state of mind where one drifts into thoughts that have no relation to the present. In recent years, cognitive scienc e has revealed a link between mind-wandering and psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder14. Anxiety is often followed by anxious content of the mind-wandering15, and thus, it is important to prevent the occurrence of mind-wandering. Focused meditation essentially requires a restful environ ment free of distractions. However, the standard tDCS approach can easily interfere with concentration meditation because of the sensitivi ty of the skin on the head. We looked specifically at walking mindfulness, which focuses the senses on the feet, away from th e head16. To maximize the benefits of walking mindfulness, we developed a method know n as treadmill walking for focused mindfulness (TW-FM). Treadmills allow individuals to walk slowly at a constant speed in the same spot in a room. This allows people to walk safely and avoid collisions, and reduces the burdensome tDCS equip - ment that disrupts meditation. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were introduced as an objective meas ure of the effects of TW-FM. Focused meditation is thought to be related to the brain's attentional function because it foc uses attention on the present moment of an object. From a neurophysiological perspective, the a lpha-band component of an EEG is thought to be involved in the allocation of attentional resources17-19. Alpha rhythms have long been studied in Zen meditation20. In the last few years, some studies have also used mindfulness to investigate alpha activity21. Here, we focused our attention on the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), which is thought to play an imp ortant role in depressive disorders. Recent EEG-based studies suggest that the rACC is the main area that predicts response to antidepressants22. EEGs can measure brain function before and after an intervention without chang - ing the study environment, so they are more sensitive to the time resolution of changes compare d with functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography. Therefore, the purpose of this randomized, double-blind, sham-cont rolled study was to investigate the aug - mentation effect of mindfulness. To this end, we introduced TW-FM to healthy adult individuals and app lied active or sham tDCS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 20 min during TW-FM. We evaluated outco mes using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State Anxiety23 before the intervention and immediately, 60 min, and 1 week after the intervention, as well as current density from E EGs before and after the intervention. Materials and methods Study design. We performed a randomized double-blind study to compare changes in active and sham tDCS groups under TW-FM. This study was conducted at the Kansai Medical University Medical Center, Osaka, Japan. The study was approved by the Certified Review Board of Hyogo College of Medicine (CRB51800005; date of approval: 15 January 2019). The data were collected from 1 February 2019 to 31 May 2020. No changes were made to the study protocol after approval. Participants. Sixty right-handed healthy individuals (age range, 20-60 years) participated in this study. The exclusion criteria were current or previous history of psychiatric or neurological disorders, curren t or previous metal (except titanium) implants (e.g., in the brain or skin), current or previous metal equipment in the body (e.g., a pacemaker), a history of head surgery, current or previous head injuries and/or resultant disorders o f con - sciousness, skin problems, a history of epileptic seizures, a history of syncope, pregnancy or possible pregn ancy, current drug user, and tDCS and TMS experience. Psychiatrists with more than 3 years of experience in the field confirmed the absence of previous neurological and psychiatric disorders through semi-structured interv iews. The study participants were recruited through posters on the staff bul letin board of Kansai Medical Univer - sity and related institutes. Prospective participants were initially pre-screened by telephone or email, and then interviewed by an experienced psychiatrist. Written informed consent was obtained fro m all participants. All procedures in this study were performed in accordance with the Dec laration of Helsinki and the guidelines for low-intensity tDCS24. Randomization and blinding procedures. The statistical analyst of our team assigned participants using a method that minimizes stratification factors. The included stratification factors were: age on the day of consent (20-39 and 40-60 years), gender, and STAI-State Anxiety (STAI-SA) score (< 40, and 40). After obtaining consent for participation and confirming eligibility, each individua l was registered as a study participant. A registration number was assigned to the participant b y the data management centre. For blind - ing to the active or sham stimulation, we used the \"STUDY mode\" in D C Stimulator Plus (NeuroConn GmbH, Ilmenau, Germany). In this mode, 5-digit number codes are linked to either the active or sham stim ulation, and the experimenter cannot identify which stimulation type is applied . The physician who conducted the experi - ments was informed of the 5-digit code by the data management centre. The details of the tDCS protocols, s uch as current intensity, duration, and electrode montages, are described below. Two physicians, including a medical doctor, administered the tDCS intervention. Upon the completion of data collection, the change rate in rACC activity was calculated before di sclosure of the allocation table and sent to the data management centre to fix the data concerning the prima ry result. The data management centre was responsible for locking the data table. Further analyses were perf ormed after the disclosure of the allocation table. Timeline of the intervention and measurements. On the day of the second appointment, we first measured resting-state EEG with the eyes closed and then conducted psychological tests. Next, we carried o ut TW-FM with either active or sham-tDCS. After tDCS we remeasured Reports | (2021) 11:22734 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02177-3www.nature.com/scientificreports/ eyes closed and conducted further psychological tests (Fig. 1). All interventions and EEGs were performed and collected at the same laboratory in Kansai Medical University Medical Center. To assess anxiety, affect, quality of life, and mindfulness status, we c onducted a series of psychological tests: STAI, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)25, the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual QoL- Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW)26, and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)27. We conducted these tests at the following time points: at consent (STAI and FFMQ), before tDCS (STAI and PANAS). After the tDCS and TW-FM intervention, the participants were encouraged to engage in walking mindfulness when possible for 1 week, and then to take psychological tests (STAI and FFMQ) and complete a questionnaire on the frequency of walking mindfulness during the week after the intervention. We asked the participants to return t he STAI, FFMQ, number of days engaged in walking mindfulness, adverse effects after the int ervention, and the onset of any medical conditions to the data management centre by postal mail. TWFM. We used a treadmill (Flat Walker 3914neo; Alinco Incorporated, Osaka, Japan) for the TW-FM. First, participants were instructed about the procedure of TW-FM. Participants were orally inst ructed about the procedure while being shown a short written brochure. They were told to focus on their soles and t highs in terms of their minutiae and to walk as follows: \"First, raise your right heel, but keep your toes on the ground a nd feel your weight shifting towards your left thigh. Second, raise your right toe and fully shift your weight onto t he left thigh. Then, touch your right heel to the ground and prepare to raise your left heel, then shift your weight again towards the right thigh. Lastly, raise your left heel, but keep your toes on the ground and feel yo ur weight shifting towards your right thigh. \" After the instruction and brief practice on the treadmill, the participants walked slowly on the tre admill (speed, 1 km/h). While walking, the participants heard the audio instruction: \"While walking, focus o n the sense of your sole. Heel to toe, heel to toe. Focus on shifting your weight from one thigh to another. Then, any t hought occurring will disappear as you walk\" . This instruction was repeated every 2 min t o allow them to focus on their soles and have their thoughts spontaneously disappear. At the end of t he TW-FM session, the participants were instructed about at-home walking mindfulness. They were encouraged t o work on walking mindfulness either at home or outside when they were comfortable doing it. They also too k home the written brochure describing the procedure explained during the TW-FM session. tDCS. We administered tDCS using a battery-driven stimulator Stimulator Plus; NeuroConn). A cir - cular anodal electrode with a diameter of 5 cm coated with EEG gel was attache d to the left dorsolateral pre - frontal cortex (DLPFC; F5, International 10/10 system), and a rectangular cathodal electrode (5 cm \u00d7 7 cm) was attached to the left shoulder. We chose the current electrode montage instead of placing the anode ele ctrode on the F3 position of 10-20 systems, based on the previous findings that the more anterior portion of the DLPFC could be more effective for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment of m ajor depressive Before the tDCS - TW-FM procedure: explanat ion and consen TW-FM procedure: follow-upDay of the tDCS - TW-FM procedureFace-to-face !

For the active stimulation condition, we applied 1 mA of tDCS for 20 min, with 30 s of the initial ramp-up and last ramp-down periods to reduce skin sensations due to rapid changes in the current intensity. For the sham stimulation condition, only 30 s of 1 mA tDCS was applied before and after 30 s of the ramp-up and ramp-down periods. EEG data recording and analysis. Eyes-closed EEGs were recorded using an EEG-1200 Nihon Kohden (Neurofax 1200, Tokyo, Japan) system. We used 30 Ag/AgCl sintered ring electrodes (Wave - guard; ANT-Neuro, Enschede, Netherlands). Data were sampled at 500 Hz, and recorded with a low-pass fi lter at 0\u00b75 Hz and a high-pass filter at 60 Hz. The recordings lasted 5 min and were carried out twice for each par - ticipant. For processing, raw EEG data were bandpass filtered at 1- 30 Hz. EEG fragments contaminated with muscle artifacts and eye blink noise were excluded by visual inspection. After removing the contaminated f ragments, we used an artifact detector in artifacts autonomously. We adopted 2-min epochs wit h as few artifacts as possible in each session. Current densities were calculated from the EEG data using standardized low-resolution brain electro magnetic tomography (sLORETA)30. The region of interest (ROI) for the rACC (x = 0, y = 45, z = 0 in the Montreal Neuro - logical Institute space) was selected based on a previous study inves tigating neurophysiological mechanisms in patients with MDD22. The ROI for the DLPFC is defined by the location under the stimulation site, ba sed on the 10-10 EEG coordinates (x = -52, y = 26, z = 28)31. We analysed the alpha band between 8.5 and 13 Hz. Statistical analysis. Based on preliminary results from previous studies, we estimated the relative risk of EEG responders between the active and sham tDCS groups and set the target number of partici pants at 60 in total (30 for group)32. STAI-trait using linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) in R version 4\u00b70\u00b72 (R Core Team, 2020) and lme4 package version 1\u00b71-23. As estimates of EEG source analys is yield non-parametric distribution across subjects, we used non-parametric approaches. Firstly, STAI-SA, STAI-TA, PANAS-PA, and PANAS-NA scores at four fixed time points were analysed using a mixed model. The dependent variable was each of the scores. We included group assignment (Group), time of assessment (Time), and interaction between group and time point (G roup * Time) as a fixed effect. The assess - ment time point was the baseline score just prior to the intervention; for the fix ed-effect variables, all dummy variables were created. Group variables were given 1 for the active and 0 for the sham s timulus group so that the coefficients represented the difference from the active stimulus group. The time point of the assessmen t was treated as a categorical variable, with the coefficient representing the difference from the assessmen t immediately before the intervention. For SEIQoL-DW and FFMQ scores, we performed the Mann-Whitney test. Significance was defined as p < 0\u00b705. Next, the rates of change of current densities throughout th e intervention were compared between the active and sham stimulation groups. Additionally, the current densities in pre- and post-stimulation were compared in the active and sham stimulation groups, respectively. As an exploratory analysis, we examined the association between anxiety and neurophysiological response t o tDCS-TW-FM. We correlated the ratios of change in STAI scores and rACC current densities from before and after tDCS-TW-FM in the active and sham groups, respectively. To examine this correlation, we used Spe arman's rank correlation because of non-parametric distribution of t he EEG source. Adverse events. To monitor adverse events, following safety guidelines, we assessed headaches and skin symptoms such as itching, pain, burning, warmth, and others (e.g., metallic taste, fatigue) immediately a nd at 1 week after the tDCS-TW-FM intervention24. Data monitoring committee. Data monitoring and management was conducted by Medical Research Support Ltd. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Clinical Research Revie w Committee of Hyogo Medical University (CRB5180005), and the study was registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Tria ls (jRCTs052180043, 30/01/2019). Results The registration period was from 2 February to 17 May 2019, and the tDCS-TW-FM intervention period was 10 February to 5 June 2019. A total of 60 participants were enrolled and underwent randomization; two participants who were allocat ed to the active group withdrew before undergoing the intervention (ac tive stimulation, n = 28; sham stimulation, n = 30) (Supplementary Fig. S1 online). The participants' baseline characteristics are shown in Data A (Ta ble 1). The characteristics of the participants, excluding withdrawals and those who failed to submit inf ormation at 1 week or had a low-quality EEG, are shown in Data B (Table 2). We adopted Data B for the analyses. Supplementary Table S1 online shows a summary of the psychological tests and the number of days the participants engaged in slow walking with mindfulness. The results of the LMMs for STAI-SA showed a significant interaction effect between 1 week after tDCS (Time) and active or sham tDCS (Group) ( = 5.02, SE = 2.13, p = 0.02) (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table S2 online).5 Vol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports | (2021) 11:22734 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02177-3www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The main effect of Time was significantly different at each assessment ti me point (immediately after stimu - lation: = -5.52, SE = 1.07, p < 0.01; 60 min after stimulation: = -9.85, SE = 1.07, p < 0.01; and 1 week later: = -8.67, SE = 1.07, p < 0.01). The results of the LMMs for STAI-TA showed a significant main effect (Time) after 60 min ( = -1.44, SE = 0.52, p < 0.01) and after 1 week of stimulation ( = -2.72, SE = 0.52, p < 0.01). We did not find the significant interaction between groups and each time point (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table S3 online), but the interaction effect between groups and 1 week after intervention was marginally significant, a consistent trend wit h STAI-SA ( = 1.95, SE = 1.03, p = 0.06). As anxiety is known to decrease with increasing age33,34, we examined the impact of age on STAI scores at baseline as well as during the course of the inter vention. We found no significant correla - tion between baseline STAI scores and age (STAI-SA, rho = -0.14, p = 0.29; STAI-TA, rho = -0.09, p = 0.51). We also examined whether age had any impact on the outcome of the intervention. We included age gr oups (20-39 and 40-60 years) used as a stratification factor as a dummy repressor to the LMM (Supplementary Table S4 and S5 online). We found that age was not associated with STAI scores (STAI-S A model: = 1.44, p = 0.34; STAI-TA mode: = -1.75, p = 0.52), and that the tDCS effect on STAI scor es did not interact with age (STAI-SA model: = 0.35, p = 0.91; STAI-TA model: = 0.86). Age was not associ ated with STAI scores at 1 week after the (STAI-SA model: = -1.17, p = 0.51; STAI-TA model: = 0.40, p = 0.64). Moreover, age was not associated with STAI scores at 1 week after the intervention in the active tDCS group (STAI-SA model: = -0.07, = -1.31, p = 0.44). These results suggested that age was not associat ed with anxiety in the present study cohort. When analysing PANAS-PA and PANAS-NA scores, one case was missing in the active tDCS g roup because of an omission in writing (n = 53, real = 26, sham = 27). The results of the LMMs for PANAS-PA did not show any main or interaction effects (Supplementary Table S6 online). The results of the LMMs for PANAS-NA showed a significant interaction eff ect between immediately after tDCS (Time) and active or sham tDCS (Group) ( = -3.25, SE = 1.46, p = 0.03) (Supplementary Table S7 online). In addition, the main effect (time) was significant at each assessment time point (immediately after stimulation: = -2.19, SE = 0.73, p < 0.01; 30 min after stimulation: = -4.54, SE = 0.73, p < 0.01; 60 min after stimulation: = -5.41, SE = 0.73, p < 0.01). These results indicated that PANAS-NA scor es were higher in the active stimula - tion group immediately after tDCS-TW-FM. Next, we compared total scores on the SEIQoL-DW between the active a nd sham stimulation groups using a two-sample t-test. No significant difference was found between post- and pre-intervention (t = 0.79, df = 52, p = 0.43).Table 1.

The Mann-Whitney test showed a significantly lower rate in the active compared with the sham group (U = 227\u00b7000, p = 0\u00b702) (Fig. 3a,b). Raw current density values in the rACC were then compared between the pre- and post-intervention. The current density was significantly lower at post- than at pre-stimulation in the active stimulation group (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: V = 320 , p < 0.001), whereas no significant difference was found between post- and pre-intervention in the sham group (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: V = 226, p = 0.61). We also examined the left DLPFC current density in the active and sham stimulation groups (Fig. 3c,d) (Table 3) to evaluate changes in activity at the tDCS site. The Mann-Whitney test showed a significantly lower rate in the active compared with the sham group (U = 217, p = 0.0 06). Raw current density values were signifi - cantly lower at post- than at pre-stimulation in the active stimulation gr oup (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: V = 281, p < 0.01), whereas no significant difference was found between post- and pre-intervention in the sham stimulation group (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: V = 156, p = 0.29). We also examined correlations between the rate of change in STAI scores from before to 1 week after tDCS- TW-FM and in the rACC current density from pre- to post-intervention in each group. Spearman's rank correlation showed no significance between the ra te of changes in STAI-SA scores or cur - rent density in either the active stimulation on rACC group ( = 0.26, S = 2166, p = 0.20) (Fig. 4a) or sham group ( = -0.10, S = 4010, p = 0.62) (Fig. 4b). By contrast, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient identified a significant correlation between t he rates of change in STAI-TA scores and current density in the active stimulation group ( = 0.63, S = 1083, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4c); however, no significant correlation was seen in the sham stimulation or rACC group ( = 0.024, S = 3567, p = 0.90) (Fig. 4d). No serious adverse events were reported. Mild adverse events included five cases of skin redness (active group: 3 and sham group: 2), 35 cases of mild pain at the electrode site, (active group: 15 and sham group: 20), and three cases of slight discomfort (active group: 2 and sham grou p: 3). One participant in the sham stimula - tion group complained of a headache 2 days after the stimulation tha t persisted for 2 days before disappearing. Discussion The results of this study revealed an interaction effect between tDCS and time, and that STAI-SA scores were significantly decreased at 1 week after active tDCS. Additionally, we found that the current density of a lpha activ - ity in the rACC was significantly decreased in the active tDCS group only, and this reduction was significantly larger in the active than in the sham tDCS group. Furthermore, in the active stimulation group, the rate of chang e in STAI-TA scores after 1 week was corre - lated with the rate of change in rACC alpha activity after tDCS. Howev er, no correlation was observed between STAI-TA scores and rACC alpha activity in the sham stimulation grou p. These results suggest that immediate neurophysiological changes in the rACC induced by tDCS could reduc e anxiety after 1 week. Figure 3.

Since the activity of the alpha band is correlated with the default mode network, alpha-band activity in the rACC can be one indica tor reflecting the state of the default mode37. Stimulation on the DLPFC affects rACC activity38. In addition, intensive meditation has been shown to increase DLPFC activity, which suggests that the combination of tDCS and TW-FM woul d boost DLPFC activity and thereby effectively decrease rACC activity39. We also found a correlation between changes in rACC activity immediately after the intervention and changes in STAI-TA scores at 1 week after the interven tion in the active but not the sham stimulation group. These results suggest that a combination of TW-FM an d tDCS could decrease anxiety by reducing rACC activity, which can help predict th e effectiveness of intervention outcomes. We found a significant reduction in STAI-SA scores after 1 we ek of the combination of TW-FM and active tDCS. This delayed effect was beyond the scope of our study. On the contr ary, PANAS-NA scores immediately after the intervention were increased in the active tDCS group. Although this study had a double-blind design, th e participants could feel discomfort as a result of the tDCS. The findings from a previous stud y support our result regarding a greater perception of discomfort in the active than in the sh am stimulation group40. It is important to note that despite feeling slightly uncomfortable immediately after the stimulus, a reversa l of the response occurred (e.g., a decrease in anxiety) after sufficient time had passed. Another st udy reported a single tDCS effect later in the day of administration41. That study compared the effects of a cognitive training test betwe en online and offline tDCS groups and found no difference on day 1; however, on day 2, the performances were significantly better for the online than for the offline tDCS group. In the present study, we did not measure S TAI scores between 1 h and 1 week after tDCS and TW-FM. Therefore, we canno t determine when the reduction in anxiety started. This issue needs to be clarified in a future study. Regarding STAI scores, we also found a general reduction in scores regardless of intervention type (sham or active). We consider that this was due to general relaxation after t he experiments. Indeed, a visual analogue scale (V AS) to assess relaxation showed a significant increasi ng trend during the course of study, regardless of intervention type (Supplementary Table S1). Anxiety decreases with increasing age in the general population33. However, the prevalence of subgroups of anxiety disorders are quite heterogeneous42,43. Our data also showed no significant association between age Figure 4.

Future research is needed to address how age interacts with interv ention outcomes in clinical cohorts. A broad range of ages may also affect the heterogeneity of physical strength. To minimize these effects, we set the speed of the treadmill machine very slow (1 km/h) to allow the participants to concentrate on their movements. We also found that age was not associated with subjective fatigue after TW-FM (r = -0.02, p = 0.87). These results suggest that age was not a major factor impacting the outcome of our concurrent TW-FM and tDCS intervention. In the present study, the association among STAI-SA, STAI-TA, and rACC was complex. First, we found that tDCS application during TW-FM can decrease STAI-SA and STAI-TA scores, but STAI-TA only marginally. Second, STAI-SA scores were significantly decreased immediately after the intervention, rega rdless of interven - tion type. Third, we found a positive correlation between changes in the rACC current density and STAI-TA scores. These results are indeed puzzling. As defined, the STAI-SA sc ore measures instantaneous changes in anxiety, while the STAI-TA measures the state of anxiety for the last 1 week. Because participants were stressed before the intervention, the STAI-SA score was increased at baseline. This could explain why STAI-SA scores decreased immediately after the intervention, as the partici pants felt relief from their psychological stress during the intervention. Indeed, we measured relaxation using a V AS; the res ults revealed that relaxation was highest before and decreased after the intervention (Supplementary Table S1). This may explain why we observe d a more robust tDCS effect on the changes in STAI-SA compared with STAI-TA scores . By contrast, we did not observe an immediate reduction in STAI-TA scores immediately after the int ervention. Instead, the reduction of rACC alpha activity was significantly correlated with the reduction in ST AI-TA scores 1 week after the intervention. Regarding the stimulation target, in the present study, we applied tDCS to the ventroanterior part o f the DLPFC, which is considered more effective for rTMS treatment in M DD28. However, it remains unclear which brain region is the most effective site to reduce anxiety. Therefore, s imilar to the optimization of brain stimula - tion in the treatment for MDD44, future research is needed to optimize stimulation targets in mindfulness as well as anxiety disorders. In the present study, we applied tDCS on the DLPFC while performing TW-FM; as a result, anxiety was reduced 1 week later. Using EEG source analysis, we found that t DCS reduced alpha activity in the DLPFC and rACC. As repeatedly shown in previous studies predicting the out comes of MDD treatment with various inter - vention methods45,46, decreased rACC alpha activity is a predictor of better treat ment outcomes. We also found that changes in rACC alpha activity were positively correlated wi th changes in STAI-TA scores at 1 week after the intervention. rACC anatomically connected with the orbitofrontal cortex and amyg dala47, suggesting that immediate changes in rACC alpha activity can modulate amygdala a ctivity over the long term. As a result, the STAI-TA score measuring anxiety for the last 1 week would be decreased. Although these results fil l some gaps, many remain, such as how DLPFC alpha activity affects rACC activity and how rACC alpha activit y reduces anxiety over the long term. Future research is needed to clarify thes e mechanisms. Several studies have been conducted on the combination of tDCS and mindfulness. One combined tDCS and mindfulness-based training to enhance working memory and anot her investigated the therapeutic effects of a combination of tDCS and mindfulness-based relapse prevention on alco hol dependence48-50. Other studies have investigated emotion and mood specifical ly. Badran and colleagues found a significant increase in the \" Awareness\" item on the FFMQ in a 1-mA compared with a 2-mA stimulation group and a sham group7. In the present study, we did not find a significant difference between the sham and active tDCS groups in \" Awareness\"; however, their result may support the notion that 1 mA is suitable for a combinat ion of mindfulness and tDCS. Another recent study compared MBCT and non-MBCT relaxation in treatment-resistant depression51. That study confirmed that the combination of MBCT and tDCS resulted in more sustained clinical improvem ent in the later period (25 days after the first intervention day, totall y after nine sessions). Those results suggest the long-period effect of a combination of mindfulness and tDCS. In the present study, eligible participants did not have any history or curre nt episode of psychiatric disorders, but at baseline, six of the 54 participants were classified as having high anxiety and 20 as having moderate anxi - ety according to the STAI-SA, whereas eight were classified as having high anxiety and 14 as having moderate anxiety according to the STAI-TA. Approximately, half of the participants has moderate or high anxiety, while None of them met the criteria for anxiety disorders. Therefore, we consider the substantial participan ts are implicated in subclinical anxiety. This study had some limitations. First, other than the day of the intervention, anxiety was assessed only at 1 week after the intervention. Therefore, we could not assess when the reduction of anxiety started an d how long it lasted. Future studies need to address this issue over a longer time course of anxiety changes. The second limita - tion is the intensity of tDCS. Recent studies have used higher-inte nsity tDCS (2 mA or more), but in this study, we used 1 mA so as to not disturb the mindfulness meditation through discomfort caused by tDCS-induced skin sensations. Third, this study was conducted on a subclinical coho rt. Therefore, whether a combination of TW-FM and tDCS is effective for general patients with anxiety disord ers remains unclear. This study revealed that a combination of TW-FM and tDCS reduced alpha-band act ivity in the rACC imme - diately after the intervention, and this reduction in anxiety was sustained 1 week later. Despite bein g a one-shot and short intervention, the reduction in anxiety persisted for at least for 1 week, and EEG could potenti ally help predict its effects. These findings suggest that a combination of TW-FM an d tDCS could improve quality of life for individuals experiencing excessive stress in modern society.
