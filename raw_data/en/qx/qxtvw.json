The study also suggests that the effects of Omega-3 fatty acids on the brain are mediated, to some degree by apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype. \"In multivariable models, higher Omega-3 index was associated with larger hippocampal volumes and better abstract reasoning,\" reported Claudia Satizabal, PhD, Univeristy of Texas San Antonio, the lead author of the Framingham paper which was published in the journal Neurology. \"Our results, albeit exploratory, suggest that higher Omega-3 fatty acid concentrations are related to better brain structure and cognitive function.\" Several previous epidemiological studies have shown correlations between Omega-3 levels, improved brain function, and attenuated risk of stroke or dementia. But interventional studies with Omega-3 supplements or high Omega-3 diets have given variable and inconclusive results. Dr. Satizabal and colleagues surmise that this is because nearly all previous studies have involved elderly subjects in whom brain changes may already be advanced and cognitive impairment is entrenched. The new Framingham study is the first to look at the relationship between Omega-3 Index (the relative percentage of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in red blood cell membranes), and brain structure and function in middle-aged individuals. After controlling for a range of demographic and biometric variables and potentially confounding factors, the Framingham investigators found a clear correlation between Omega-3 index readings and hippocampal volume on MRI. The Omega-3 index more accurately reflects overall dietary intake of Omega-3 fatty acids over the prior three months than does measurement of plasma Omega-3 levels at isolated points in time. \"In the brain, DHA is incorporated into neuronal and glial cell membranes, particularly in grey matter and synapses,\" the Framingham authors write. \"Both DHA and EPA are metabolized into bioactive molecules involved in neurogenesis, neurotransmission, and inflammation resolution.\" A Younger Population The new study involved 2,183 dementia- and stroke-free participants, who had a mean age 46 years. A majority of the subjects were from the Framingham Third Generation cohort, meaning that they are grandchildren of participants in the original Framingham Heart Study which was begun in 1948. The investigators also included over 900 subjects from the Framingham Omni 1 and 2 cohorts comprised exclusively of non-white individuals. Over half of the participants are women (53%), and 22% are carriers the APOE-e4 gene. Nearly 60% held college degrees or above. The median Omega-3 Index reading was 4.6% (interquartile range 3.8-5.8), which Satizabal and colleagues state is \"consistent with cohorts of similar age, but slightly lower than older cohorts.\" \"What's important about this study is that it replicates what we saw in the Framingham Offspring 10 years ago, in subjects who had an average age of 66. However, this study represents Generation 3, their kids essentially, who had an average of 46.\" William S. Harris, PhD, President, Fatty Acid Research Institute All participants underwent brain MRIs, to measure total brain volume, total gray matter and hippocampal volume, as well as white matter hyperintensity volumes. They also took an array of standardized neuropsychological tests close to the times of the MRIs, to assess episodic memory, logical memory, processing speed, executive function, and abstract reasoning. Structural & Functional Differences After controlling for a range of demographic and biometric variables and potentially confounding factors, the Framingham investigators found a clear correlation between Omega-3 index readings and hippocampal volume on MRI. Mean hippocampal volume was 6.9 cm3 for the participants in the top three quartiles for Omega-3 index, versus 6.8 cm3 among those in the lowest quartile. \"Every standard deviation unit increase of log-transformed Omega-3 index was related to 0.003 cm3 larger hippocampal volumes relative to intracranial volume,\" Satizabal and colleagues report. The difference was statistically significant, and the general correlation also held for EPA and DHA levels independently of the composite Omega-3 index (Satizabal C, et al. Neurology. 2022). Participants with DHA levels and Omega-3 index readings in the three upper quartiles had larger total gray and cortical gray matter volumes, as compared with those in the bottom quartile. Notably, there was an association between higher Omega-3 index, higher DHA levels and lower white matter hyperintensity volumes. Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are regions of macrostructural brain damage that correlate with neurocognitive and neuromotor decline. In addition to the structural changes, Omega-3 levels also correlated with differences in cognitive performance. Specifically, higher levels of all omega-3 parameters-EPA, DHA, and the Omega-3 index\u2014were associated with significantly better performances on the Similarities test, a standardized assessment of abstract reasoning. This correlation remained robust after adjusting for vascular (ie, stroke) risk factors. \"Every standard deviation unit increase of log-transformed Omega-3 index was related to 0.003 cm3 larger hippocampal volumes relative to intracranial volume,\" Claudia Satizabal, PhD, University of Texas, San Antonio Impact of APOE The Framingham researchers found that APOE-e4 status had some effect on the relationship between Omega-3 levels and indicators of brain health. For example, the positive relationship between higher DHA levels and increased hippocampal volume was only present in participants who were non-carriers of the APOE-e4 allele. It was not seen in carriers of the gene. On the other hand, the reduction in WMH seen in connection with higher EPA, DHA, and Omega-3 index levels, was only found in the APOE-e4 carriers. Carriers also showed a relationship between increasing EPA levels and better performance on the Similarities test. This was not seen in the non-carriers. \"Stratification by APOE status in our study suggested distinct potentially protective associations of omega-3 PUFA with gray and white matter.\" The clinical significance of these APOE-related effects is not entirely clear. But given that APOE has a role in the transport and metabolism of lipids, and is involved in the movement of omega-3 fatty acids into the brain, it makes sense that gene-based variations in APOE would influence the relationship between circulating Omega-3 levels and brain function. The Framingham authors note that their findings are in line with population studies suggesting differential effects by APOE status in the association between omega-3 PUFA and neurocognitive indicators. \"It has been suggested that APOE-e4 carriers have different patterns of brain activity at younger ages, including larger white matter volumes, better white matter integrity on DTI (diffusion tensor MRI), as well as better attention. Alternatively, the beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFA on brain white matter may occur through other pathways related to reductions of vascular risk factors that may contribute to cerebral small vessel disease.\" Satizabal and colleagues believe APOE status is an important consideration for future studies of the impact of Omega-3s on brain health. It is a factor that has usually been overlooked in past studies, and it could account for some of the discrepancies between observational studies showing robust correlations between Omega-3s and brain health, and interventional studies giving equivocal outcomes. Start Early Past interventional studies may also be hindered by the fact that most of them tested diet or supplement interventions in elderly people who already have significant cognitive impairment. In other words, the interventions are started too late in the course of the disease. \"Epidemiological and intervention studies suggest omega-3 PUFA may be most beneficial to preserve brain health from early midlife, as our study suggests, and just before the onset of moderate cognitive changes.\" \"What's important about this study is that it replicates what we saw in the Framingham Offspring 10 years ago, in subjects who had an average age of 66. However, this study represents Generation 3, their kids essentially, who had an average of 46,\" explained William S. Harris, PhD, one of the authors of the current study. Harris is also president of the Fatty Acid Research Institute (FARI), and co-inventor of the Omega-3 Index testing method. \"The results of this study show that low red blood cell DHA levels are associated with smaller brain volumes and a 'vascular' pattern of cognitive impairment, even in persons free of clinical dementia,\" said Harris in a press release following publication of the Satizabal study. \"This suggests that intervening early and maintaining an optimal Omega-3 Index (8% or higher) could play an important role in staving off cognitive decline, as well as dementia and Alzheimer's in the long-term,\" Dr. Harris said. A large CSIRO study of a commercially available krill oil supplement showed that patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) obtained modest but meaningful improvements in knee pain, stiffness, and physical function after supplementing with krill oil. Krill (Euphausia superba) \u2014 a diverse group of small marine crustaceans \u2014 are among the world's most abundant species in terms of total biomass. Researchers estimate there are 300,000 million metric tons in the Antarctic Ocean alone. Like fish, krill are rich in the inflammation-reducing eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA). Patients with the highest levels of inflammation at baseline\u2014as indicated by elevated baseline C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels-experienced significantly greater improvements in knee pain following krill oil treatment than those with low or medium degrees of inflammation at baseline. Omega-3 supplements generally, and fish oils in particular, are known for their anti-inflammatory effects. Numerous fish oil studies offer evidence of its ability to quell inflammation. The literature on krill oil, however, is far less robust. The CSIRO team, headed by Dr. Welma Stonehouse, proposed that krill oil could impact OA-related pain via similar anti-inflammatory mechanisms observed for fish oil. Their randomized, placebo-controlled trial took place at four clinical sites across Australia over six months. It included 235 healthy adults between 40 and 65 years of age. All participants had clinical diagnoses of mild to moderate knee OA and habitually consumed low amounts of long-chain (LC) omega-3 (-3) fatty acids in their diets. None used fish oil supplements. The investigators split the participants into two groups: a treatment group receiving 4 grams of krill oil per day (4 one-gram capsules), and a control group that took a vegetable oil placebo. Participants were instructed to take the assigned capsules with or immediately after a meal. The krill supplement-a popular Australian retail brand containing the Superba BOOST manufactured by Aker BioMarine-provided 1 g krill oil (E. superba oil; 0.15 g EPA, 0.07 g DHA) and 0.11 mg of astaxanthin per capsule, totaling 880 mg of -3 and 45 mg astaxanthin daily. According to the investigators, the recognized dosage at which EPA in combination with DHA typically exert an anti-inflammatory response is >2 g per day. They point out that 73% of the EPA and DHA in Superba krill oil is phospholipid-bound, which they suggest would \"facilitate more efficient incorporation of long-chain -3 PUFAs into tissues than triglyceride form.\" Owing to fact that the -3s are phospholipid-bound, \"krill oil's anti-inflammatory effect would be greater than what would be expected based on its long-chain -3 PUFA content alone.\" The 4-gram daily dosage was deliberately set higher than the levels used in prior knee OA studies, \"so as to facilitate an anti-inflammatory response, but in amounts suitable as a complementary medicine.\" Supplementation with krill oil translated clearly into an increase in blood -3s levels, as indicated by changes in the OmegaQuant Omega-3 Index\u2014a measure of -3 content in red blood cell membranes. In the krill group, participants' mean Omega-3 Index increased from 6.0% at baseline to 8.9% at 3 months and to 9.0% at 6 months. In the placebo group, on the other hand, the levels did not change, with Omega-3 Index measurements remaining between 5.4% and 5.5% throughout the study. Reduced Pain & Stiffness The CSIRO researchers assessed OA severity at baseline, three months, and six months, using a visual analog self-assessment scale. They quantified changes in knee pain, stiffness, and physical function using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scales. The krill and the placebo groups both showed some degree of improvement of knee pain over the course of the trial, but, the krill group showed a greater decrease. The difference in adjusted mean change between groups at 6 months was 5.18 (95% CI: 10.0, 0.32; P = 0.04). Closer analysis indicated that patients with the highest levels of inflammation at baseline\u2014as indicated by elevated baseline C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels-experienced significantly greater improvements in knee pain following krill oil treatment than those with low or medium degrees of inflammation at baseline. Compared with the placebo group, the patients taking krill oil also showed greater improvements in knee stiffness and physical function. The difference in adjusted mean change of WOMAC scores between the two groups at 6 months was 6.45 for knee stiffness; 4.67 for physical function; and -4.83 for total knee score. All of these changes were statistically significant. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of need for NSAIDs. Safer Therapies Needed Though krill oil cannot be considered a \"cure\" for OA, the results of the Stonehouse study do hold promise for patients who suffer from OA-associated joint inflammation and pain. OA is a major cause of chronic pain and disability worldwide. While conventional drug therapies\u2014typically NSAIDs-may provide some symptomatic relief, they do little to quell the underlying drivers of inflammation. Stonehouse and colleagues note that, \"Owing to the adverse effects associated with long-term NSAID use, there is a need to identify alternative therapies that can safely and effectively reduce pain and inflammation and improve function.\" Krill oil differs structurally from other dietary sources of -3 in that it delivers a relatively high amount of -3 PUFAs in phospholipid form rather than triglyceride form (the primary source of EPA and DHA in fish oil). Preliminary research suggests that the -3s in krill oil might have a higher bioavailability than those in fish oil. There's some evidence that krill's higher relative phospholipid content could facilitate -3 incorporation into the tissues more efficiently than fish oil. Krill also confers the additional inflammation-lowering benefits of astaxanthin, a naturally occurring red pigment that acts as an antioxidant. Astaxanthin exists in only a handful of natural sources, including salmon, shrimp, trout, crayfish, algae, and yeast. Closing the Research Gap The CSIRO trial is the largest, longest, and highest-dose krill oil study to date, at least in the context of OA. The main result was a significant increase in Omega-3 Index to 9% after 6 months, which translated into a modest but significant reduction in knee pain and stiffness, and improvements in physical function of affected joints. Prior to the CSIRO trial, studies of krill supplementation and OA were mostly small, short, and used very low krill dosages. In addition to confirming krill oil's anti-inflammatory properties, the CSIRO data showed that it is remarkably safe. There were no worrisome adverse events during the 6-month trial period. Further, the patients taking the krill oil did not report any of the undesirable effects sometimes linked to fish oil, such as \"fish burps,\" flatulence, diarrhea, or bleeding/vascular complications. Krill oil is also free from the strong fishy aroma associated with fish oil supplements that some people find unpleasant. That said, krill oil is not suitable for individuals with shellfish or seafood allergies. Since it is from an animal source, it is not an option for strict vegans and vegetarians, and since it is derived from crustaceans, it is not appropriate for people who follow the Kosher dietary restrictions. By design, the Australian researchers recruited patients with mild to moderate knee OA for this trial, but excluded those with more severe conditions. That decision was based on the view that severe knee OA, \"may be beyond the point of improvement with a supplement or may require high doses of NSAIDs that may mask any supplement effect.\" For patients with milder, early-stage OA\u2014in whom there is a possibility to reduce knee pain and improve function, krill oil supplementation is a promising option. Roughly one in five people suffers from chronic pain of some sort. It is one of the leading causes of disability, reduced productivity, and escalating medical care costs. While pain is often multifactorial, there's a lot we as clinicians can do to help our chronic pain patients once we understand the relationship between inflammation, repair deficit, and the symptoms patients are experiencing. The Cleveland Clinic defines pain simply as a sign that something is wrong somewhere in the body. Acute pain arises quickly and resolves quickly once the pain stimulus ends or is removed. Chronic pain is pain that persists for longer than six months stretching into years. While many disease states can cause chronic pain, so can injury, and psychological factors. Often, it's a complete mix of causes. Persisting inflammation means there are accumulating repair deficits. The body continues to call for pro-inflammatory responses, even as the immune system machinery is unable to resolve the initial problem. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle of tissue damage. Since there are usually multiple factors, it can be difficult to identify and treat the \"root\" cause, especially in cases where pain has persisted for years. Inflammation & Repair Deficit Inflammation is a factor in most if not all chronic pain cases, and from a treatment perspective, it's a good place to start. Most pain syndromes have an inflammatory profile, whether its rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, migraines, or interstitial cystitis, to name just a few common conditions. Irrespective of the characteristic of the pain, whether it is sharp, dull, aching, burning, stabbing, numbing, or tingling, it is safe to say that inflammation and inflammatory responses are at work. But it is important to understand that chronic inflammation occurs when repair deficits persist. What do we mean? Think of it like this: following an injury or tissue damage following an infection, the body calls for defense and then repair. But in many people\u2014especially older people or those with poor health status-the first-responder team is unable to complete the defense and repair mission. Recruits are called, via pro-inflammatory signals e.g., cytokines. Typically, in a healthy individual, those urgent signals will diminish as the body heals, and inflammation will subside. Persisting inflammation means there are accumulating repair deficits. The body continues to call for pro-inflammatory responses, even as the immune system machinery is unable to resolve the initial problem. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle of tissue damage. Over time, this ongoing unresolved inflammatory response can damage healthy cells and organs, causing constant pain in muscles, tissues, and joints. Silent or unappreciated inflammation is due to loss of tolerance and homeostasis in the immune defense and repair system. Persisting inflammation means there are accumulating repair deficits. The body continues to call for pro-inflammatory responses, even as the immune system machinery is unable to resolve the initial problem. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle of tissue damage. Repair deficits account for more than two thirds of all chronic disease including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's neurodegeneration, autoimmune conditions, and some forms of cancer. Chronic inflammation is quite naturally considered one of the major underlying causes of conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, myofascial pain syndrome, and osteoarthritis. So what can we do? Here are our top three lifestyle tips to minimize pain: Plant-Based Diet: There's ample research to show that a plant-based diet can improve the status of those with chronic pain and disability associated with musculoskeletal conditions. One reason for this is that over time a vegetable-rich diet will tend to alkalinize the body, which reduces inflammation. The pH status can be a guiding light for knowing whether the body is in acid alkaline balance. We recommend that patients aim to maintain a healthy first morning urine pH - between 6.5 and 7.5. Drink Water: Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! Slacking on those 8 glasses a day of water can be costly. Not drinking enough may increase pain sensitivity. In a 2016 study, voluntary hypohydration altered pain thresholds and increased pain perception in a cohort of 17 healthy male subjects. Drinking enough water can also keep joints healthy and well-lubricated. It also flushes out unwanted toxins and irritants that can cause an undue burden on all of the body's systems. Integrate Mind and Body: The mind, emotions, and attention play an important role in the experience of pain. Generally, movement-based practices like yoga, Tai chi, even walking, are helpful for people with chronic pain, provided they are undertaken carefully. It is even better if the mind is involved as well. Somatic education techniques like Feldenkrais and Alexander can be particularly helpful in reducing chronic pain. By becoming aware of how one's body interacts with its surroundings, it becomes possible to relinquish habitual movement patterns that cause or contribute to chronic pain. Other helpful mind-body approaches include progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, laughter, mindfulness meditation, hypnosis, guided imagery, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Helpful Supplements There are many botanical and nutritional supplements that can be helpful for patients with chronic pain. Here are four must-haves: Polyphenols: This group of plant compounds includes dihydrate and flavanols like oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPC). They are linked to improved cognitive health and mental function. They also have a profound antioxidant function and can decrease the extent of inflammation. All of this is very helpful for someone who is fraught with pain. Magnesium and Choline Citrate: Magnesium is a grossly under-recognized and under-utilized nutrient. It affects many different physiological systems, and it is so versatile in its function. In the context of pain, magnesium decreases nerve pain and since it offsets the effects of calcium, it acts as a muscle relaxant and helps with muscular pain as well. Magnesium deficiency is often what leads to muscle stiffness and cramps. I recommend magnesium citrate glycinate and magnesium absorption.Beyond pain itself, magnesium helps to mitigate anxiety, insomnia, chronic stress, and systemic inflammation. Omega-3 Fatty Acids: EPA and DHA can naturally help reduce pro- inflammatory signals that play a role in pain. They're helpful in decreasing the intensity of joint pain and stiffness in rheumatoid arthritis, neck, and back pain, as well as pain caused by inflammatory bowel disease and menstrual cramps. Vitamin B12: This is a must for anyone with pain, especially of the neuropathic type. As detailed in a recent systematic review, B12 can alleviate pain by a number of mechanisms: it promotes myelination, increases nerve regeneration and decreases ectopic nerve firing. We recommend using the hydroxocobalamin form of B12. Chronic pain is undoubtedly a complex situation. Some patients may need interventions beyond what we've covered here. But we have found that the recommendations above can help many people effectively navigate their way to significant pain relief, better overall health, and improved wellbeing. Emerging research is challenging the long-held belief that tissue damage following myocardial infarction is permanent and irreversible. For decades, the conventional medical view has been that damaged myocardium cannot regenerate, owing to the fact that heart cells are not as readily replaced as are other cells in the body. Several research teams around the world, including a group based at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Heart Institute, are studying the mechanisms that put the brake on myocyte regeneration. This line of inquiry suggests that the myocardium might, in fact, have regenerative capacities, opening up a whole new world of treatment approaches. That's good news, given that CVD is the still the number one cause of death in North America. Every year, over 800,000 people in the US have heart attacks. Though 90%, at least initially, long-term sequelae can be debilitating. CVD prevalence will continue to rise if present trends continue. In a recent report from the Bogalusa Heart Study, nearly one-third of young adults (32%) in their 20s and 30s already show arterial plaque formation (Razavi AC, et al. JAHA. 2021). Much of the blame for that lies with unhealthy diet and lifestyle. COVID-19 can also cause myocardial damage. Many infected people suffer from rapidly-developing blood clots, endothelial inflammation, pericarditis, and myocarditis. Inflammation of the myocardium can lead to cardiomegaly, scarring, and death. Emerging research is challenging the long-held belief that tissue damage following myocardial infarction is permanent and irreversible. This line of inquiry suggests that the myocardium might, in fact, have regenerative capacities, opening up a whole new world of treatment approaches. There are also a small but significant number of myocarditis cases\u2014usually transient\u2014in people who have received the Pfizer or Moderna COVID vaccines. This seems to be most prevalent with 18-39 year-old males, and tends to occur after the second dose. According to a recent report by Steven Gundry, MD, in the journal Circulation, the vaccines can trigger a rise in inflammation markers like IL-16, soluble Fas, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Gundry S. Circulation. 2021). COVID long-haul patients are also drawing renewed attention to the issue of myocardial damage, since so many experience chronic heart problems. After treating long COVID sufferers for over fifteen months, it became clear to me that while most could achieve a general recovery from COVID via intensive nutrition and lifestyle-based protocols, roughly 50% need extra help resolving the cardiovascular problems. As I dug deeper into the medical literature I discovered research about nutraceuticals that show promise for helping COVID long-haulers to recover faster and better. Many of these nutrients and herbs may also help regenerate myocardium and improve cardiovascular function in people with non-COVID myocardial damage. Vitamin C: Vitamin C is crucial to the production of collagens, the most abundant proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM), and therefore the most abundant proteins in the body. The ECM has a fibrillar structure that provides a framework for tissue/organ morphogenesis, as well as for regeneration after injury. Vitamin C impacts ECM homeostasis by regulating collagen synthesis and maturation. It is also an antioxidant, able to prevent damage caused by free radicals. In the cardiovascular context, vitamin C's antioxidant capacity may mitigate endothelial damage following a heart attack or a viral infection such as COVID-19. Vitamin C is also influential as a co-factor in many enzymatic reactions that determine how stem cells differentiate during tissue repair. It therefore plays an important role in both the production of myocardial cells, and in cellular repair and replacement (D'Aniello C, et al. Stem Cells Intl. 2017). Vitamin D3:The roles of vitamin D3 in bone health, genetic expression, antiviral protection, and cancer prevention/treatment are well known. Less well known is the impact it has on cellular repair, especially cells in the heart and circulatory system. The endothelium is an active organ, not simply an inert lining which allowed water and electrolytes to pass through. One of its key functions is the maintenance of nitric oxide levels. Vitamin D3 plays a central role in that process, by increasing cytoprotective nitric oxide (NO) while reducing peroxynitrite\u2014an unstable nitrate isomer that can cause considerable oxidative damage. This favorable rebalancing allows endothelial cells to be repaired more rapidly. Experiments using human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures showed that vitamin D3 could effectively restore healthy NO/peroxynitrite balance in tissue perturbed by angiotensin-II. The authors conclude that \"vitamin D3-stimulated improvement of endothelial function may directly benefit the treatment of the dysfunction of the cardiovascular system.\" (Khan A, et al. Intl J Nanomedicine. 2017). Vitamin E: Vitamin E is particularly effective in protecting and repairing cell membranes due to its strong anti-oxidant properties. The benefits of vitamin E\u2014and tocotrienols in particular-in the treatment of heart disease, vascular disease, brain disorders, and fatty liver disease are well-documented. Vitamin E is also an efficient scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically targeting lipid oxidation. It can prevent oxidized fats from damaging DNA. Vitamin E also helps to extend the antioxidant neutralizing capacity of vitamin C, making these nutrients a powerful one-two punch . Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP): Citrus pectin is a naturally-occurring soluble fiber in the cell walls of citrus fruit peels. It is rich in beneficial -galactoside. However, pectin's long-chain polysaccharides are too large to be digested and absorbed into the bloodstream. So, the benefits of ordinary citrus pectin are limited to the GI tract. It is possible to shorten the pectin fibers enzymatically, and through controlled changes in pH and heat. This enhances absorption, hence the term \"modified citrus pectin.\" Another step called de-esterification decreases the cross-linkages and gelling effects seen with unmodified pectin. It also renders the fiber ends more available to bind and inhibit Galectin-3, an adhesive cell surface protein that is a strong predictive marker for CVD and other inflammatory conditions. The Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease (PREVEND) study showed that elevated serum Gal-3 correlated with a three-fold increase of all-cause mortality in a cohort of nearly 8,000 general population subjects followed for a median of 10 years (DeBoer RA, et al. J Intern Med. 2012). Data from nearly 3,000 patients in the Framingham Heart Study showed that elevated circulating Gal-3 correlates strongly with abdominal adiposity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and other indicators of CVD (Nayor M, J Am Heart Assoc. 2016). MCP has a specific and very high binding affinity for human Gal-3. Researchers at the Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, showed that MCP ameliorated cardiac dysfunction, decreased myocardial injury and reduced collagen deposition in a rodent model of myocardial fibrosis. The MCP downregulated a host of pathogenic biomarkers related to inflammation and fibrosis. The data, though preclinical, do support the notion that Gal-3 is a therapeutic target in post-infarction myocardial fibrosis, and that MCP may help to reduce the damage (Xu GR, et al. Biomed & Pharmacotherapy. 2020). CoEnzyme Q10: This valuable nutraceutical has a proven track record for the prevention and the treatment of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, MI, heart failure, viral myocarditis, cardiomyopathies, dyslipidemia, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and other cardiometabolic conditions. CoQ10 can significantly improve cardiomyopathy related to genetic or acquired dysfunctions in the left ventricle or mitral valve. A daily dose of 200 mg ameliorated fatigue and dyspnea, reduced posterior wall thickness, and improved mitral valve function. In viral myocarditis, it is able to quell inflammation. It also exhibited strong anti-inflammatory properties during various heart surgery procedures, and during recovery, as measured by C-reactive protein levels. CoQ10 reduces the negative side effects\u2014especially myopathy\u2014of statin drugs. It helps to both prevent and treat heart failure by improving the heart's contractile force and increasing cellular oxygen levels. It also improves myocardial cell survival during ischemic events, and limits post-infarction myocardial remodeling (Zozina V, et al. Current Cardiol Rev. 2018). Magnesium: Severe magnesium deficiency can lead to heart attacks. Magnesium deficiency also sensitizes the myocardium to the toxic effects of various drugs, as well as to hypoxia. Long term magnesium deficiency may also lead to chronic electrical instability of the myocardium, by affecting the sodium and calcium flow into the cells. Extracellular magnesium ions exert a profound beneficial influence on the flexibility and structure of the arteries, arterioles, and veins. Most importantly, it is the transport agent that delivers glucose and oxygen to cell membranes and to the mitochondria for energy production. Several studies have shown that anywhere from 40% to 50% of all patients hospitalized for CVD-related events are magnesium deficient (DiNicvolantonio JJ, et al. OpenHeart. 2018). Supplementation has significant potential cardioprotective benefits. But one of the challenges is that while supplemental magnesium may cross cell membranes and enter into target cells, it does not always reach the mitochondria. The addition of berberine along with magnesium can help. Berberine: Berberine is a natural compound found in plants such as European barberry enhances cellular energy production via interactions with the Glut-4 molecule to transport glucose and oxygen from the inside of the cellular membrane to the mitochondria. By increasing the efficiency of glucose delivery, it lowers the levels of circulating glucose that can cause oxidative damage to the cardiovascular system Berberine possesses a variety of pharmacological and biological properties that can potentially enhance cardiovascular performance: it reduces myocardial apoptosis and necrosis; it is a agent that can mitigate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury; and also lowers serum cholesterol and LDL (Yu L, et al. Oxidative Med Cell Longevity. 2016) Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs): The ultimate goal of cardiac repair is to regenerate functionally viable myocardium, to prevent cardiac death. SPMs have unique properties that can play a big role in the repair process. SPMs are a subtype of Omega-3 fatty and maresins. Physiologically, SPMs signal the immune system to stop generating pro-inflammatory signals, and instead to accelerate the return to homeostasis. They play a unique role in helping the body to shut down the immune response, to minimize additional inflammation, to clear away damaged tissue, and to promote tissue remodeling. The degree of post-MI inflammatory damage is a major determinant of both the subsequent healing process and the long-term prognosis. Cardiomyocyte death leads to wall thinning, ventricular dilatation, fibrosis, and ultimately to ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. In the wake of an MI, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes contribute to the clearance of dead cells, while activating reparative pathways. SPMs act on specific receptors to regulate the activity of these various leukocytes. SPMs also blunt the release of inflammatory mediators, and endothelial cell Soehnlei Front Pharmacol. 2018). Astaxanthin: Astaxanthin is a red carotenoid pigment naturally produced by a type of microalgae called Haematococcus pluvialis and by some forms of yeast. It is well known for its ability to scavenge free radicals. Astaxanthin is itself able to capture free radicals, and it also stimulates production of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and it IL-1, also apoptosis, and modulates autophagy. In the context of CVD, there are several animal studies showing cardiac muscle preservation when astaxanthin is given either orally or intravenously prior to the induction of ischemia. The evidence is promising, though not yet confirmed in human studies (Fassett RG, Coombes JS. Molecules. 2012). Several recent review articles propose a role for astaxanthin in mitigating the cardiovascular and respiratory damage caused by the COVID-19 cytokine storm. Given its myriad anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, this is a reasonable hypothesis though again, there are not yet any clinical trials to prove efficacy. L-Taurine: Taurine is a unique sulfur-containing amino acid that influences many cellular functions including osmoregulation, antioxidation, ion movement modulation, and conjugation of bile acids. It is found in high concentrations in seaweed, shellfish, and fish, and to a lesser degree in beef, lamb, pork, and poultry. Taurine is much more than simply a building block for proteins. It is anti-inflammatory, and there's some evidence that it can benefit the cardiovascular system, possibly by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. Following ischemia induced by coronary artery occlusion, taurine resulted in significantly smaller myocardial infarct size. It also elevated superoxide dismutase levels, and decreased interleukin and TNF-. In patients with heart failure, taurine improved tolerance and recovery during increased exercise. In a study of obese women, supplementation with 3 grams of taurine per day for eight weeks, resulted in meaningful weight loss and also significant drops in systemic inflammation (Rosa TC, et al. Eur J Nutr. 2014) In another study, continued supplementation with taurine corrected cardiomyopathy by restoring mitochondrial function and improving cardiac energy metabolism (Qaradakhi T, et al. Nutrients 2020). Arterosil: This innovative product is a supplemental form of rhamnan sulfate, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from two types of sea algae (Monostroma and Monostroma Nitidum). Rhamnan also anti-inflammatory agent (Okamoto T. J Natural Med. 2019). Arterosil is particularly effective in repairing damage to the endothelial glycocalyx, the gel-like glycoprotein layer that coats the inner surfaces of blood vessels. The glycocalyx is, essentially, the first line of endothelial defense, preventing the penetration of harmful substances like oxidized LDL, cholesterol, fats, inflammatory compounds and clotting factors. Glycocalyx damage is one of the first steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and it correlates strongly with many biochemical markers of CVD. Arterosil has myriad cardiovascular benefits. A Baylor University study showed that within hours of ingestion, arterial elasticity increased by an average of 89.6%. MRI studies of men and women with high-risk carotid artery plaques, showed average plaque regressions of 46.8% in men and 64% in women who took Arterosil for 3 months. There was also a 56% average reduction of the lipid core size in the carotid plaques, indicating a shift away from unstable plaques prone to rupture. In addition to the above list, the following nutraceuticals also deserve honorable mention in the context of preventing Lumbrokinase, and Hawthorn berry. END Charles K.
