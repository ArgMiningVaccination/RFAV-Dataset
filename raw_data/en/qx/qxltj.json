It is [described](https://www.integratedbowen.com/about/) as being \"a holistic approach to pain relief and healing that is based on the recognition that the underlying cause or source of many musculoskeletal, neurological, neuromuscular and other health or pain problems can be found in the form of an imbalance of the energetic and facial systems of the body.\" These \"energetic\" systems are described as being associated with \"chi\" - a universal life force energy that is part of a pantheistic belief system. During a typical treatment, which lasts about 30-45 minutes, the practitioner uses his/her fingers to make a gentle rolling type of motion on different muscles in the body. The practitioner then pauses, sometimes even leaving the room for a few minutes, to allow the body to \"make its own adjustments\" or, in a sense, to heal itself. The Bowen Therapists Federation of Australia says that the actual origins of this type of treatment are unknown but admits \"there do appear to be links with traditional Chinese medicine,\" which is based on the alleged existence of a universal life force energy, which could explain why AR saw yin-yang symbols displayed on their websites. However, many practitioners of BT are typically vague about the type of energy involved, which can lead unsuspecting consumers to believe the Bowen therapist will be working with the legitimate natural energy systems of the body rather than a universal life force energy that science says does not exist (see [this blog ](http://www.womenofgrace.com/blog/?p=4)for more detailed information on this subject). For instance, here's how one [practitioner](http://www.bowentherapytechnique.com/page3/page3.html) explains it: \"The Bowen Technique affects the body primarily through two of its main regulatory systems (the nervous system and the energetic system) to bring it back to a state of balance or homeostasis.\" Only after reading much further into the description does one learn that this \"energetic system\" is actually chi. \"The Bowen Technique stimulates circulation of energy (Chi or Life Force) and clears energetic blocks. Most moves overlap with acupuncture points and some actually cross over 2 or 3 acupuncture meridians at once.\" Another rather serious problem is that independent scientific testing of BT has been largely inconclusive and there is no regulation in this field, which means it is open to just about anyone who wants to hang out a shingle. As a result, the Department of Health of Australia [published](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/private-health-insurance-reforms-fact-sheet-removing-coverage-for-some-natural-therapies) the results of a review in which Bowen Therapy was listed as one of 17 therapies for which no good evidence of effectiveness was found. As of April, 2019, none of these therapies are eligible to receive health insurance rebates. \"In fact, there is currently not a single trial testing the efficacy of Bowen Therapy for any disease or symptom,\" reports Dr. Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor at Exeter University and an expert in alternative medicine in his book, SCAM: So Called Alternative Medicine. AR is correct in saying that some \"alternative\" medicine techniques are much better than those that \"'treat the symptom' form of western medicine\" but those that have any association with the false god known as a \"universal life force\" should be strictly avoided by Christians. Because of the vastly differing interpretations of Bowen Therapy that are in practice today, it is possible that some practitioners may not incorporate a belief in \"chi\" into their practice. However, the prevalence of these beliefs among Bowen Therapy practitioners makes it imperative that Christians either avoid this therapy altogether or exercise extreme caution when choosing a therapist. \u00a9 All Rights Reserved, Living His "}
