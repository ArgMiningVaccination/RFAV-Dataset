This is a wakeup call. We cannot re - main silent. It requires from us more concrete action to help stop racial in - justice and inequities in our society. This begins with each one of us by our recognizing and loving one another as brothers and sisters, created in the image and likeness of God, gifted with equal hu - man dignity and our embracing each other as members of one global family. These recent events can easily distract, frustrate, and discourage us. But God re - mains with us and His abiding presence is manifest in many mysterious ways: in the many acts of goodness, compassion, charity and heroic sacrifices of many of our brethren. There are other reminders as well. Our Holy Father's call for fraterni - ty and social friendship to build a better, more just and peaceful world (the encyc - lical Fratelli Tutti ), inspires us to rise above these challenges. The US Bishops Pastoral Letter, Open Wide Our Hearts: The Endur - ing Call to Love , likewise challenges us to help heal the effects of polarization brought by systemic and institutional racism in our society through our encounter with the living God in the person of Christ that can Most Reverend Oscar A. Solis, Bishop of Salt Lake City, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Island Affairs (continued on page 2)bring conversion of hearts. Christ's resurrection proves that the power of love, light and life are stronger than hatred, darkness and death. The hope of a new normal and a beginning of a new life after the pandemic is upon us. We have more reasons to rejoice and be glad. There is other good news that brings East - er joy and gladness. One of our Asian and Pacific Island communities, the Filipinos, are celebrating an important Jubilee. The year 2021 marks the 500th Y ear of Christianity in the Philippines. Since Spain arrived in the country and introduced Christianity to the natives in 1521, the Catholic faith has been a strong influence and an integral part of the history, culture and life of the Fili - pinos. Millions of migrants and foreign workers live their Catholic faith and bring it with them wherever they settle. Their rich culture and colorful traditions are visible and recognized all over the world. The first Filipino saints were missionaries and martyred in foreign lands. No wonder Pope Francis gave the Filipinos a flattering compliment, describing them as \"smugglers of the faith\" in recognition of their contribu - tion to the Church's mission of evangelization. The global theme of their grand celebration is \"Gifted to Give, \" to view the past with gratitude for the Christian faith they have received and move to the future to share this blessing with others as disciples of Christ. Pope Fran - cis, in his video message for the occasion, thanked the Filipinos for their \"deep sense of family, communi - ty and fraternity that keeps them firm in faith, joyful in hope and attentive in charity. \" He urged them to be grateful and generous missionaries of the Gospel and to renew their enthu - siasm for evangelization, \"to reach out to others and bring them the hope and joy of the Gospel, the love of God for our brothers and sisters. \" The faith, spirit of unity, joy and harmony of our Asian brothers and sisters give us a sense of hope and cour - age to confront the many challenges we face these days. It serves as an antidote to the pandemic of polarization, sad - ness and discrimination that ills our nation and the world. Let us join them in their celebration. The faith, spirit of unity, joy and harmony of our Asian brothers and sisters give us a sense of hope and courage to confront the many challenges we face these days. 3 Executive Director's Message | 4 Chairman's Reflection | 6 Native American Affairs | 7 African American Affairs 8 Asian and Pacific Islanders | 9 Hispanic Affairs | 11 Pastoral Care of Migrants, Refugees, & Travelers 12 European American Y oung Adult | 13 Journeying Together | 15 Family Prayer for Vocations | 16 Planning Team Voices | 18 Y oung Adult Ministry | 19 Campus Ministry | 20 Family Guide to COVID-19 21 Committee Members | 23 ResourcesIn this issue: (continued from page 1) 2 One Church, Many CulturesI have a communications background. Following the news regularly and contrasting my sources is ingrained in my DNA as a former journalist. I cannot help but want to know what happened today in the world, both around me and far away. Hearing different versions is always fascinating and usually helps one to gain some perspective. I originally got into Catholic journalism because it allowed me to com - bine two passions: proclaiming the Good News and telling a good story. Or better yet, it afforded me the opportunity to share inspirational stories about everyday heroes and saints. My current occupation does not allow me to write as often as I used to, but the hunger for news is still there, especially good news. And yet, more and more, I feel tempted to dis - engage, to turn off the \"bad news. \" It seems that's all there is to report anymore! There are days I feel the need to stop the torrent of stories filled with violence, hateful acts and hateful speech, disrespect of certain groups of people and commu - nities, and blunt general disregard for human life and the dignity of all people. Sometimes one needs to take a break from so much neg - ativity, repeated a thousand times and spreading online like a virus. Constant exposure to it affects our mood and our relationships, and after a while people begin to believe that is all there is to the world, a scary place where every man is for himself, where there is no room for cordial engagement or collaboration for the common good. Weariness makes the TO REMAIN IN CHRIST, A CHRISTIAN MUST CHOOSE LOVE Mar Mu\u00f1oz-Visoso, MTSEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S MESSAGEtemptation to disengage loom large. But looking the other way or disengaging from what is going on around us, and sometimes because of us, is akin to the attitude that Jesus exposes about the priest and the Levite in the story of the Good Samaritan (Lk 10:25-37). In Fratelli Tutti , Pope Francis uses this parable to analyze our social relationships, and the language he proposes is striking: \"It could be said that, here and now, anyone who is neither a robber nor a passerby is either injured himself or bearing an injured person on his shoulders\" (FT 70). This language frightens me. It prompts me to think: Lord, which one of those characters am I? What does my personal life and ministry look like? Am I a robber? A passerby? Am I injured and in need of healing myself? How many injured lives am I carrying on my shoulders? The story of the Good Samaritan is constantly being re - peated in today's world. And yet, Francis reminds us that Je - sus uses this parable to encourage us, to show us the Christ- like path forward. What is a Christian to do in front of so much violence and suffering, danger and injustice? The Lord encourages us \"to persevere in love, to restore dignity to the suffering and to build a society worthy of the name\" (FT 71). What if we were all to examine our everyday actions and reactions, our ministry and witness through the lenses of those three verbs: Today, how much did I persevere in love, contribute to restoring the dignity of others, and help to build a true community? How about my community of faith and those who I admire, how well did they measure up? How well did the sources I rely on for information and education do? As Catholic Christians, we are called to fashion our com - munities and relationships in the image and likeness of the Holy Trinity, a true communion of love and life, our mod - el par excellence of unity in diversity brought together by the strongest bond of all: Love. It is our contribution to the world and to society. Or at least it should be. It is hard to \"persevere in love. \" Y et, that is exactly what is required of any Christian worthy of their name. \" As the Father loves me, so I love you. Remain in my love\" (Jn 15:9). A true follower of Christ cannot be a passerby, ignoring hu - man suffering and looking the other way; cannot remain indifferent to human suffering and hateful speech; cannot and should not contribute in any way to sowing division or inciting violence against others. A true Christian allows the (continued on page 4) 3 One Church, Many Culturesbe ourselves the \"robbers\" of the dignity of others... So, let us not allow ourselves to be uprooted and carried away by the twisters and tornados of the \"bad news\" con - stantly on display, even in Catholic social media. No. A Christian must persevere in love, like a tree firmly planted and a house built on solid rock. After all, Christ leaves no room for interpretation: \"This I command you: Love one another\" (Jn 15:17). Holy Spirit to help them overcome their fear and become the personification of the merciful embrace of the Father. A Christian must act to restore dignity; must employee the means at his or her disposal to heal injuries and divisions and allow the \"Inn-keeper\" to do what is necessary to restore health. As a member of the One Body, a Christian cannot tell another member \"I don't need you\" (cf. 1Cor 12:21-22). And God forbid that we Christians, individually or collectively, Dear brothers and sisters: Peace be with you! The Risen Lord is the source of all hope and the Holy Spirit strengthens us with his gifts to be faithful mission - ary disciples who take seriously the command to \"Go and make disci - ples of all nations\" . Filled with Easter joy and Pentecost spirit, I am excit - ed to share with you the Committee on Cultural Diversity in the Church's priorities for the next four years. In No - vember 2020, the USCCB General Assembly approved its Strategic Plan 2021-2024. At that same virtual meeting, the bishops also elected Most Rev. Arturo Cepeda, Aux - iliary Bishop of Detroit, as chairman-elect for Committee on Cultural Diversity. He will be taking the reins of the Committee at the end of the November 2021 General As - sembly. For the next few years, the Committee on Cultural Di - versity decided to put a strong emphasis on several main areas: vocations, young people, families, Catholic educa - tion and intercultural leadership. CULTURAL DIVERSITY PRIORITIES TO FOCUS ON YOUNG PEOPLE, VOCATIONS, STRENGTHENING FAMILIES AND EDUCATION Archbishop Nelson J. P\u00e9rez, Archbishop of Philadelphia, Committee on Cultural Diversity in the ChurchCHAIRMAN'S REFLECTION To promote vocational discernment to the priesthood and consecrated life among culturally diverse commu - nities the committee will work closely with the USCCB Committee on Clergy, Consecrated Life and Vocations, as well as diocesan vocations directors, seminaries and religious houses of formation to evaluate current efforts and strategies for the identification, invitation and reten - tion of diverse candidates. In addition, the CDC Commit - tee would like to enlist the help of families and friends in promoting prayer for vocations. To this end, we are happy to offer the beautiful Family Prayer for Vocations to the Priesthood and Religious Life composed by one of our own, Bishop Joseph Perry of Chicago, chairman of the Subcommittee on African American Affairs. Whether you use this resource or others available to you, I invite all Catholic families, apostolic movements and associations of the faithful to \"conspire\" with us, your bishops, to pray for vocations from the many different cultural and ethnic communities, so that our future priests, deacons, religious sisters and brothers, and consecrated lay people reflect the magnificent diversity of the Church and enrich our par - ishes, communities and ministries with their gifts. Another big priority will continue to be accompanying youth and young adults. The Journeying Together process continues to bring together young people and ministers of diverse cultural and socioeconomic background. Over the next year or so we hope to delve deeper into some of the common and urgent topics that have emerged during our intercultural dialogues, as well as encouraging young (continued on page 5) 4 One Church, Many Culturesadults and ministry leaders to \"take home the conversa - tion\" . At the national level, we are working on producing the proceedings from the process. Hopefully they will lead us to take action and make commitments to one anoth - er, so that the joy of the Gospel and the message of hope in the Holy Father's exhortation, Christus Vivit , reaches young people wherever they are, no matter their back - ground or circumstance. We will also invest some time and effort on finding ways to support and improve the Catholic education of diverse populations, especially those currently underserved by our schools and parishes. There is a desire to strengthen marriage and family life in the different ethnic and cultural communities under the committee's mandate. The CDC Committee will see to the intercultural implementation of the upcoming USCCB Pastoral Plan/Vision for Marriage and Family and each of the five Cultural Diversity subcommittees have planned objectives and activities designed to strengthen marriage and family among their respective populations. Of course, the committee on Cultural Diversity will continue to promote intercultural competence in ministry by updating its curriculum and producing additional re - sources, as well as seeking ways to also support ordained and lay ministers serving (or discerning service to) spe - cific ethnic and cultural groups, and communities with special needs such as migrants, refugees, people on the move, as well as people with disabilities. The committee is also committed to support and accompany the various communities through the numerous congresses and gath - erings, whether virtual or in-person, that convene and strengthen the various communities. Following the theme for the 2021-2024 USCCB Strategic Plan, Created Anew by the Body and Blood of Christ: Our Source of Healing and Hope , this Committee is also fully involved in the plan - ning of a Eucharistic revival process that hopes to recon - nect the faithful with the Eucharist and to their baptismal call. We have our work cut out for us! But the Lord goes be - fore us. Please pray for your bishops and help us accomplish these tasks through prayer, participation and sponsorship of activities. We cannot do it without your help! May the Lord reward all your good deeds abundantly! (continued from page 5)CHAIRMAN'S REFLECTION A healthy openness never threatens one's own identity. A living culture, enriched by elements from other places, does not import a mere carbon copy of those new elements, but integrates them in its own unique way. The result is a new synthesis that is ultimately beneficial to all, since the original culture itself ends up being nourished. Pope Francis, Fratelli Tutti , 148 5 One Church, Many CulturesMANY NATIONS, ONE FAITH Robert Barbry II, Executive Director of the Tekakwitha ConferenceNATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS \"The Tekakwitha Con - ference began in 1939 as an annual meeting for Catholic missionaries who evangelized American In - dians in Northern Plains states. \" This is a quote from Marquette University Ar - chives describing the cir - cumstances and purpose for which the Tekakwitha Conference came into ex - istence. What began as something of a support group for priests doing ministry on reservations eventually reorganized it - self into a Catholic 501(c)(3) organization and an annual gathering that bears its name. Only now, this annual gathering welcomes bishops, priests, men and women religious, and laypeople alike. At - tendees include those in active ministry in Native Amer - ican, First Nations, and Alaskan Native settings to those who simply have a devotion to Saint Kateri Tekakwitha, Servant of God Nicholas Black Elk, or any number of holy, indigenous men and women. Rooted in its Roman Catho - lic identity and dedicated to making room for the many cultural expressions of America's first peoples, the Tekak - witha Conference aims to be the voice of those who are both Native and Catholic. As Catholics, we all can attest that representation mat - ters. For a Church that began in the Middle East and spread throughout the inhabited world, it is important for every tribe and nation to be able to see themselves reflect - ed in the face of Jesus Christ \u2014to look upon His Church and say assuredly, I belong here. The conversation among those who identify as both Native & Catholic has long been about finding the ways in which their traditional na -tive ways are compatible with their Catholic faith. To many, there is no divi - sion, no this or that, only both/and. In Kateri Tekakwitha, Native Catholics find this worldview personified. Historically, members of the Tekakwitha Conference have been among the most fervent advocates and in - tercessors for her cause of canonization. In 2012, when Holy Mother Church finally called her \"Saint, \" it was a moment of both celebration and affirmation. In the near-decade since, many other causes for sainthood have been opened, explored, or petitioned for indigenous men and women who lived a life wholly dedicated to Jesus Christ and his Church without compromising the very fabric of their identity. This year, the Tekakwitha Conference will commemo - rate its 82nd year of ministry with a virtual conference. The organization, like so many others, has recognized its need to be agile and to adapt its methods and means of ministry while safeguarding its mission. The holding of this first-ever virtual Tekakwitha Conference represents, in another way, all the work that remains. Historical trau - ma, racism, and representation are issues still present in the hearts and minds of faithful conferencegoers and first- time attendees alike. To learn more about the Tekakwitha Conference or to find out how to register for this year's virtual conference in July 2021, please visit tekconf.org. 1https://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/Mss/TC/ TC-sc.php It is important for every tribe and nation to be able to see themselves reflected in the face of Jesus Christ. 6 One Church, Many CulturesBorn approximate - ly 100 years after Co - lumbus's journey that began the colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Father Pe - ter Claver, a newly or - dained Spanish priest began his ministry in Cartagena, Colombia, South America. Cartagena was a ma - jor port for the slave trade. Father Claver put himself at the service of the slaves \u2014tending their basic needs (food, medi - cine, clothing, etc.). This put him in the crosshairs of Christian slave masters. He won them over by tirelessly demonstrating that slaves were human beings/God's creation. Father Claver is credited with evangelizing over 300,000 souls. Pope Leo XII canonized him on January 15, 1888. In the early 1900's in the United States; the movement to establish social justice/fraternal organizations in the Black community was at its peak. Out of a need to aid the Black community, and, other Catholic fraternal orders were not open to Black people, in 1909 four Josephite priests and three laymen established the Knights of Peter Claver, Incorporated (KPC). By 1935 membership was open to Knights, Ladies Auxil - iary, Junior Knights and Junior Daughters; all who joined to THE KNIGHTS OF PETER CLAVER AND LADIES AUXILIARY: CONTINUING A 400-YEAR SOCIAL JUSTICE LEGACY 14th Supreme Lady Micaela J.

Membership numbers 17,000; there are over 600 courts, councils, and junior units in parishes/ dioceses throughout the USA and South America. Knights, Ladies, and Juniors have remained faithful to the Church throughout segregation, the sex abuse scandals, and the continued fight for racial equality. Since inception, KPC provided $25+ million in scholarships & tutoring pro - grams, supported vocations & catholic schools, established a foundation (https://claverfoundation.org) with a $3 mil - lion endowment, supported research to fight blood dis - eases\u2014Sickle Cell/Kidney Foundation; fed the hungry in soup kitchens/food pantries, survived Hurricane Katrina, and continued its social justice commitment throughout the pandemic with virtual discussions/webinars that addressed Domestic Violence, Dignity of Black Life/Black Lives Matter, Human Trafficking, Criminal Justice, & Racism.

Due to financial troubles, my family had to leave behind the motherland. I was 16 and traveling with only two pieces of luggage. I was doubtful and yet, this is all our story\u2014our fathers' fathers. Even St. Joseph has a story to tell how he brought his fami - ly to Egypt when situation was not quite ideal in the homeland. And all of us who share this story enter into this mystery\u2014not of the unknown but of \"God-known. \" The Philippines was a land of mystery to some handful of voyagers who set sail 500 years ago from Spain. In this 1521 expedition, did the travelers willingly joined or were they scared of the unknown \u2014like me? The year 2021 marks 500 years when the image of the Child Jesus, the Santo Ni\u00f1o, was gifted to the King and Queen of the island of Cebu and made way for hundreds of natives to be bap - tized into Christ. Recognizing this as more than Christian History, we honor the sacred past of the indigenous who imbedded in the Filipino streams of life the fullness of God in all of us. We enter into the mystery with full awareness that our identity as Filipinos had always been inextricably, linked to the propagation of faith. \"Gifted to Give: Enlivening our Faith, Transforming the World\" , is a year-long celebration in the United States that would manifest expressions of intercultural gifts, model mutual listen - ing, and sharing of the rich and the poor, thus promot - ing new spaces for truth - ful, more intimate sharing. Threading the stories of in - dividuals and families, the website www.1521stories. com, will be a place where we can begin to recognize Christ in one another's journeys and open up the sacred pathways woven in the mystery of our lives. With the alarming increase of young people leaving the Church and the social isolation the pandemic has deep - ened, it is enough for us to intentionally pause, listen and recognize that the darkness may bring to light this mys - tery of joy and exuberance in the Power of the Cross\u2014a reminder that hidden in the suffering and darkness is the glory of God\u2014individual, cultural, or ecclesial. The Quincentenary celebration is a gift that Filipinos give to the universal Church and the world as we turn the corner into a post pandemic way of life. In contemplating, what 500 years of Christianity means to the Philippines, may we\u2014Filipinos or brothers and sisters in Christ\u2014ven - ture into the God-known mysteries of our lives\u2014the mys - tery hidden from ages that is, \"Christ in YOU, the hope for glory. \" (Colossians 1:27) We must put human dignity back at the center and on that pillar build the alternative social structures we need. \" Pope Francis, Fratelli Tutti , 168 8 One Church, Many CulturesThe results of the V National Encuentro of Hispanic/Latino Ministry expressed the need to pay more attention to marriage and family life in the Hispanic/Latino com - munity. The project Por Tu Matrimonio [\"For Y our Marriage\" in Spanish] from the Subcommittee on Hispanic Affairs responds to this call, and to the USCCB's strategic priority to encourage and heal families and inspire Catholics to embrace the Sac - rament of Matrimony. Por Tu Matrimonio provides infor - mation, advice and resources in Spanish to dating, engaged and married couples, and their families with trustworthy Catholic content, which is faithful to Catholic teaching and God's plan for marriage and family. In November 2020, the Secretariat of Cultural Diversity in the Church's Office of Hispanic Affairs received a grant from the Catholic Communication Campaign to revamp the website portumatrimonio.org, and hire a content manager. In February 2021, the new website was launched during National Marriage Week. In March and April 2021, we be - gan publishing new content related to the Y ear of Saint Jo - seph and the Y ear \" Amoris Laetitia Family. \" We have formed THE RELAUNCH OF THE POR TU MATRIMONIO WEBSITE: RENEWED EFFORTS IN SUPPORT OF HISP ANIC/LATINO COUPLES Patti Guti\u00e9rrez, of Patti's Catholic Corner, Content Manager of portumatrimonio.org HISP ANIC AFFAIRS a team of writers who will share about their experiences on various topics related to life as a couple and family life.

Para en anima 10 One Church, Many CulturesJOURNEYING TOGETHER EXPERIENCES: THE IMP ACT ON MY FAITH, SPIRITUAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE Jessica Gallegos, Director of Religious Education K-12, Holy Spirit Catholic Community, Diocese of BoiseP ASTORAL CARE OF MIGRANTS, REFUGEES, & TRAVELERS The experiences I have had with Journeying Together will be something that will stay with me forever. I have been taught so much when it comes to my faith, my spiritual life and my work as a Director of Religious Education K-12 in Pocatello, Idaho. Seeing oth - er young adults from different cultures from all over the United States and even those who have migrated here from other places has truly shown me how great and diverse the Catholic Church is. I have been able to see the richness of our great faith in these young adults, their amazing traditions and how they incorporate their culture in prayer and at Mass. Some of their stories I can relate to as a Mexican-American child of a migrant farmworker and others have stories that are new to me. All of this has impacted my faith immensely because even in the face of adversity and sadness there is so much strength, love and faith coming from them that it sets my heart ablaze. With the Journeying Together process I was able to learn about different Rites we have in the Catholic Church, for instance, our Eastern Rite brothers and sisters who are part of our great family. I got to hear Fr. Tony Massad, a Maronite priest, speak about the Eastern Rites and how they are under the directive of the Pope\u2014that we are one. When Pope Francis was in Iraq for an apostolic visit, I saw the Holy Mass being celebrated at The Chaldean Cathedral of Saint Joseph, Baghdad. Seeing the Pope willing to go and visit this suffering part of our great Church and embrace the people truly filled me with joy. Without being a part of Journeying Together I don't think I would have paid attention or understood why it was important, the healing and the love. Being a part of this experience makes me want to be even more welcoming, to learn and teach more about the richness and diversity of the Catholic Church. Overall it makes me want to journey with everyone and meet them where they are with love and compassion and most of all to invite God into this encounter. My heart and prayers go out to those who struggle with not having the support, space, and the welcome from those in the Church. I have been praying for more openness and will - ingness so that our Church can become even more welcoming, more able to listen and more able to be a source of healing. What is important is to create processes of encounter, processes that build a people that can accept differences. Let us arm our children with the weapons of dialogue! Let us teach them to fight the good fight of the culture of encounter! Pope Francis, Fratelli Tutti , 217 11 One Church, Many CulturesIn today's world when we are challenged to form and devel - op relationships at a physical distance, Journeying Together has become a gift to me. Meeting virtu - ally throughout the last ten months has enriched my under - standing of the di - versity of the Church in the United States and ultimately strengthened my own faith life. As I reflect on the spiritual gifts I've received during this initiative, my understanding of my own privilege prevails, through different aspects of the word's meaning in my life. First, I recognize the privilege of being able to practice and express my faith in an area of the country with so many others whose roots are also in different parts of Europe. I can't think about the Journeying Together process without picturing the beautiful mosaic in our cathedral in Y oungstown, the Cathedral of Saint Columba. The mosaic depicts the Blessed Mother surrounded by sixteen saints of the Church who represent the ethnic and cultural roots of the Diocese of Y oungstown. Often appreciated for its beauty, the mosaic doesn't get as much attention as it is owed for its symbolism of unity through diversity. These saints represent not only European Americans, but other cultural groups as well, highlighting both our ancestral diversity and our unity A MOSAIC OF UNITY Luke Politsky, Director of Development & Stewardship, Diocese of Y oungstownEUROPEAN AMERICAN YOUNG ADULT through the Church. It reminds us of our roots in different parts of the world, the struggles each saint endured, and how their lives pointed to Christ as the victor. While the mural is meant for the viewer to connect with one or more saints through a shared ethnic background, the \"big picture\" is how we all must work together for the Church. They are not separate works of art; they are one. While a prayer for unity is a challenge in itself to us as followers of Christ, we are also called to express the diverse cultural traditions of our faith at the same time. Considering that my own interactions with fellow Catholics in my area consist of mainly European Americans, Journeying Together has gifted me the great privilege of interacting with and learning from individuals from more diverse groups of Catholics living throughout the United States. It is an honor to listen to stories of panelists' struggles and successes, to speak with sisters and brothers across cultural groups through small group discussions, and to hear moving reflections from our bishops. Finally, I acknowledge my privilege as a white Christian man in the United States, which I continue to learn more about each day. I also continually learn about how I can use my privilege to lift others up. I'm grateful that throughout this initiative, I've had the opportunity to express my faith journey through the lens of being European American, rather than labeled as simply a white or Caucasian person. I think fondly of my Polish, Italian, Slovak, and Croatian ancestors each day as I remember their struggles, their hopes for a better life, and their dependence on Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. 12 One Church, Many CulturesJourneying Together is a process of dialogue and encounter focused on the Church's ministry with youth and young adults that fosters understanding and trust within and across cultural families toward a more welcoming and just community of faith. The process began in July 2020. There are five steps in the process. At the end of June 2021, we will conclude Step Three. For the purposes of this process, we have grouped ourselves in to six distinct cultural families: Black or African American, Asian & Pacific Island American, European American, Hispanic/Latino American, Native American/Alaska Native, and Pastoral Care of Migrants, Refugees, and Travelers (People on the Move). For additional information, go to https://www.usccb.org/committees/cultural-diversity-church/journeying-together STEP THREE: INTER-CULTURAL CONVERSATIONS After hosting intracultural conversations in Step 2, all cultural families met together monthly, January through June 2021.

We thank you for the children with which you have blessed us. Bless us as we use this day to give you praise. Help our children grow towards you through the various things they learn about the mysteries of life and creation sewn by your hand. Grant wisdom to me/us their parent(s), their teachers and others you have given to guide them. Preserve our efforts to give our children all that they deserve. We pray you grace our children with faith, openness of heart, a willingness to learn, a desire to do good to others as you have taught. Keep them ever strong and ready for any test of character. As they grow in knowledge and experience inspire in our children a desire to serve you in holiness of life. In whatever walk of life they choose be for them a true path to your kingdom. May you find among our children generous hearts to serve you and the Church perhaps as a priest, or religious brother or sister. Should their Calling be to extend this family of ours, may theirs be a holy matrimony and family life after the example of your life with Mary and Joseph. Child/Children: O Jesus, whisper in my heart how I might best serve you. Make me strong in faith, always attentive to people's needs, ever spiritual, understanding and charitable. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, I love you very much. Bless our priest(s) and religious who serve(s) us. Bless my parents, our bishop and pastors and all who help the Church's work. Family: Almighty God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, increase the number of our priests and religious men and women. Preserve them for your Church. Keep them zealous in their vocation and successful in their labors. May they do all things for love of you and the Church. We pray through our Lord Jesus Christ who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, One God forever and ever.

Each one of us is called to be an artisan of peace, by uniting and not dividing, by extinguishing hatred and not holding on to it, by opening paths of dialogue and not by constructing new walls.

As cultur - al families prepare to share their story... stories, young adults are invited to describe their lived experience of faith and culture. In hearing from each community, it is clear as Sr. Joanna Okereke, HHCJ, assis - tant director for the Pastoral Care of Migrants, Refugees and Travelers, recently said, \"We are a community of communi - ties. \" Throughout the Step 3 dialogues of Journeying Togeth - er we have learned of over 500 native American tribes, the vast Asian Pacific Island communities of Hmong, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Hawaiian/Kanaka Maoli, and the Black and African American communities, descendant from Africa and the Caribbean. We have become aware of the Migrant, Refugee and Traveler communities who en - compass ethnic groups, migrants (those who harvest sea - sonal food, or work traveling shows like the circus, the ro - deo, or race cars and mariners), refugees (those who suffer forced migration) and travelers. The stories are beautiful. They stir our hearts. I cannot help but think of the disciples on the road to Emmaus, \"were not our hearts burning within us?\" The witness of young adults across cultural families inspires us and ignites our faith. It is a tremendous gift to hear about faithfulness, courage, resil - ience, and love through the testimony of young adult wom - en and men. It is also painful to see young adults struggle to be included, accepted, or trusted. Many labor to be seen and treasured as part of the body of Christ. Participants in these dialogues experience a sacred listening that reveals intimate ways in which God works within, through, and among us. The stories shared are a testament to the strength of the hu - man spirit and the Holy Spirit that urges us on. We are human. Each person uniquely made in the im - age and likeness of God (Gen 1:27). We are called to love God and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Mt 22:36-40). Love and dignity become apparent in the personal stories shared during these dialogues. The goodness of genuine care for one another and an unrelenting faithfulness to God is revealed in these conversations. The Spirit moves through these stories and in our hearts, as each participant reflects on the testimonies given and examines personal experience, considering how they are similar and ways in which they are different. Some common themes have emerged in these exchanges: the longing for inclusion, the hope for recon - ciliation, the grace of being seen and the ever-present love of God. These are moments to celebrate as we experience a unity of our faith. As humans, we also fall short. As a Church, we also fail. Our failure, as people of faith, is evidenced in the testimo - nies of exclusion, of judgement or even harm. Stories that illustrate times when we individually or collectively denied the value of a culture, when we did not welcome our broth - er or sister, or when we could not see the other as made in the image and likeness of God. Those sharing their witness have spoken of exclusion, judgement, subtle off-handed JOURNEYING TOGETHER \u2014STEP THREE: INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUES Most important of all is the synodal spirit: to meet each other with respect and trust, to believe in our shared unity, and to receive the new thing that the Spirit wishes to reveal to us. 16 One Church, Many Culturescomments, and outright prejudice. The experiences of our brother and sisters call us to reflect on the God-given digni - ty of the human person and to consider how we, as faithful Catholics and as a Church, are called to repent, to reconcile and to respond. On this journey, we learn from one another. We are learn - ing to truly listen... to listen well and deep before we act. Gaudium et Spes reminds us to live as the body of Christ, that when any one of us suffers, we all suffer. Pope Francis, in his book Let us Dream: The Path to a Better Future , writes \"We need a respectful, mutual listening, free of ideology and predetermined agendas. The aim is not to reach agree - ment by means of a contest between opposing positions, but to journey together to seek God's will, allowing differences to harmonize. Most important of all is the synodal spirit: to meet each other with respect and trust, to believe in our shared unity, and to receive the new thing that the Spirit wishes to reveal to us. \" The Journeying Together process provides a unique syn - odal opportunity to envision anew how to be Church here in the United States of America. As this adventure engages young men and women and those who minister with and to them, we stand at an extraordinary threshold. In Journey - ing Together, we can see the breath and beauty of our very diverse Church and we have before us a chance to radically love Jesus Christ. This process allows us to encounter one another, as Saint John Henry Newman would say \"Heart Speaking to Heart. \" As we are called to love one another, and to make the struggle our own, we emerge from these dialogues with greater insight, perspective, and compassion. Through dia - logue participants build the skill and capacity to truly listen to one another and to ponder, in our hearts, the experience of the other. The personal and sacred testimonies that have been shared and will be shared offer an impetus for our in - dividual and collective prayer and discernment. These dia - logues help equips us with perspective and insight to chart a path forward in to Step 4 of Journeying Together, where we\u2014young adults, ministry leaders and bishops \u2014will dis - cern necessary pastoral responses, means of engagement and greater solidarity. Through the cultural family preparations, the panel pres - entations, small group sharing, episcopal reflections, and prayer we are building up the body of Christ. We are foster - ing friendship as we encounter one another in faith. We are honing our pastoral sensitivities as we consider and discern pastoral needs and necessary responses. This dynamic pro - cess provides an opportunity to go deeper in faith and to broaden the reach of faith as we look ahead to the next step in the Journey. Step Three: Pastoral Care of Migrants, Refugees, & Travelers, April 21, 2021 17 One Church, Many CulturesHONORING THE BODY OF CHRIST Anna Johnson, Y oung Adult Ministry leader, Maryknoll / Seattle, W A Throughout Jour - neying Together, I have been chal - lenged, invited, and stretched, and my faith has expanded. One Black African American panelist asked, \"Do we feel we are guests at the ta - ble of the Lord, rath - er than a part of the body of Christ?\" This question sticks with me, particu - larly as the point echoes across other sessions. Thinking about my own body, when I hear music, my feet begin tapping along to the beat. This tapping, if I al - low myself, can fill my whole body with joy and dancing. When I ignore my feet, my entire body misses out on the joy of the dance. I felt this with the drumming prayer during the session led by those representing communi - ties under the Pastoral Care of Migrants, Refuges and Travelers (PCMRT): a prayer of joy, celebration, and giving glory to God, in a form I don't often experience. If I don't acknowledge and respond to the invitation of Christ's dancing feet, moving me to joy and celebration, then my life and prayer will certainly be diminished. On the flip side, when part of my body is hurting, my entire body suffers. I need to name which body part hurts to the doctor, who then tells me what the rest of the body can do to address the pain's source and heal. In Journeying Together, we have also heard deep hurt in the Body of Christ. We need to recognize and listen to the part of the Body that is hurt, and then take Spirit-in - formed action. For me, this action must include recog - nizing and responding to how I have inflicted harm, intentionally or unintentionally. As Corinthians says, \"The eye cannot say to the hand, 'I do not need you!'\" When I center on European American experiences of faith, obscuring the rest of the body of Christ\u2014such as Native American Indigenous histories, experiences, and wisdom\u2014 I am saying, \"I do not need you. \" When I look away from the pain that caused a small group member to share, \"I love this Church, but I'm not sure it loves me back, \" I am saying, \"I don't need you. \" Reminded of the incredible hospitality I have received from many PC - MRT community members, when I do not extend that same welcome forward, I am saying, \"I don't need you. \" When I see the dignity and lives of AAPI and Black/ Af - rican American members of the Body of Christ not up - held and do not act, I am saying, \"I do not need you. \" It is uncomfortable and painful to see how I have harmed the Body of Christ, but as with any bodily harm, we must draw near to it in order to seek forgiveness and healing. JOURNEYING TOGETHER \u2014YOUNG ADULT MINISTRY It is uncomfortable and painful to see how I have harmed the Body of Christ, but as with any bodily harm, we must draw near to it in order to seek forgiveness and healing. 18 One Church, Many CulturesIT IS FREEING TO SHOW UP FOR ONE ANOTHER, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT OUR EXPERIENCES ARE DIFFERENT Kelly Adamson, Director of Residence Life Ministry and Campus Ministry Graduate Assistant Program, University of Dayton Two phrases come to mind when I reflect on the Journeying To - gether process: listen - ing with the ear of the heart and speaking the truth in love. This pro - cess is one of inten - tionally entering into conversations that are uncomfortable, but within a covenantal relationship that leans into the discomfort for the sake of Love. Each time we gather, we enter into a space in which difference is recognized and honored and in which we ac - knowledge that the Church is bigger than our lived expe - rience or perspective of it. We listen to one another as we name the ways in which the Church is our beloved home even as we name the ways in which the Church is a place where harm has been done. We confess the ways in which we have fallen short \u2014individually and collectively. We are real and radically honest. Elsewhere in ministry, we say we dislike the language of theological spectrum (conservative/liberal and tradition - al/progressive), but too often we spend time trying to get a sense of where others are so we know if they are 'safe' with the truth of our experience of life with God and ministry and Church. Even as ministers, we can spend time trying put each other on the spectrum we claim is inadequate in an effort to gauge how honest we can be with one another and to determine where the comfortable and safe spaces are to be real. There is something freeing about engaging in open and honest conversations through Journeying Together. I en - ter conversations with colleagues expecting to be a bit un - comfortable; expecting to be challenged; expecting to learn something about others, about myself, about God. I expect my assumptions about the infamous theological spectrum to be upended. And it is freeing. It is freeing to show up for one another acknowledging that our experiences are differ - ent, that are perspectives are unique, and that we share a common spiritual home that is a vibrant and living tradi - tion. In this culturally diverse experience of Church I ex - pect theological diversity in a way that does not judge it or shame it and try to coax it to be more like my theological perspective, but instead celebrates it. As we continue journeying together as Church, I pray that we will grow in our ability to listen with the ear of the heart and to speak the truth in love. I also pray that the fruit of this process may be that we learn to expect, celebrate, and invite diversity in the Church in its many sacred forms. JOURNEYING TOGETHER \u2014CAMPUS MINISTRY Two phrases come to mind when I reflect on the Journeying Together process: listening with the ear of the heart and speaking the truth in love. One Church, Many Cultures 19We should get vaccinated to protect ourselves and to protect those around us. Without vaccines, we\u2014along with our friends, families, co-workers and neighbours\u2014are at risk of serious illness from COVID-19. Receiving the vaccine is an act of love toward the other members of our community and part of our moral responsibility for the common good. As people move from one place to another, diseases like COVID-19 can easily cross borders and infect anyone who is not protected. This means no one is safe until everyone is safe in a pandemic. A pandemic disrupts social and family life. In order to protect people, countries have taken extreme measures like nationwide lockdowns that have had serious socio- economic, political, ecological and psychological implications. Vaccines can do a great deal of good to stop the spread of the virus and prepare the ground for physical and socio-political healing. Therefore, receiving the vaccine, once it is available, can be considered an act of social love. Even though COVID-19 vaccines are being developed as rapidly as possible, vaccines will not be approved by regulatory agencies or introduced in countries in the general population until their effectiveness and safety have been demonstrated. Even after COVID-19 vaccines are approved, monitoring for safety and effectiveness continues. All of the ingredients in vaccines\u2014as well as the vaccines themselves\u2014are thoroughly tested and monitored to ensure they, and the quantities in which they are used, are safe.

A COVID-19 vaccine is first tested in animals to make sure that it is safe for humans to use and to see if it is likely to work against the disease. It is then tested in a large sample of humans before it is approved and made widely avail able. Each country has regulatory bodies that oversee vaccine safety and efficacy before they are used widely. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinates a number of independent technical bodies that review the safety of vaccines prior to and even after they have been introduced. Vaccines that are approved for use by WHO have gone through rigorous tests and clinical trials to show that they a re safe and effective. It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity (protection against the virus that causes COVID-19) after vaccination. Some vaccines require individuals to receive two shots. Some require only one shot. For those that require a second dose, maximum protection won't start until a couple of weeks after your second dose. It's important to remember, however, that no vaccine provides 100% pro tection.How are COVID-19 vaccines developed and tested? Will I be protected as soon as I have had a COVID-19 vaccine? Will I still need to follow phy sical distancing if I have a COVID-19 vaccine? Even after you get your vaccine, you should continue to wear a mask, wash your hands regularly and keep your distance from others for as long as your government or local authorities recommend. While vaccines can protect you from severe forms of COVID-19, we still do not know yet how effective they will be at preventing transmission. Continued physical distancing and hygiene measures give you and other s the best protection from catching and spreading the virus. Both this disease and the vaccine are new. We don't know how long protection lasts for those who get infected or those who are vaccinated. As vaccines are rolled out globally and studies continue, we will be able to learn more about how long this protection lasts. Currently, there is no evidence that existing vaccines or treatments for other diseases will protect against COVID-19. To be protected, you need to get one of the authorised COVID-19 vaccines and continue practicing physical distancing and hygiene measures. Vaccines are one of the most effective tools to help stop the pandemic. Vaccines will work with your immune system so it will be ready to fight the virus as soon as possible if you are exposed. The scientific and vaccine manufacturing communities around the world have been working faster than ever to develop and produce vaccines that can protect people against COVID-19 and help end this crisis. Since the emergence of this new coronavirus several vaccines have been approved and started to be rolled out. Most countries have their own national regulatory authority that decides whether a vaccin e is appropriate for use in their territory. Check with your country's health department to find out which vaccines are approved, and which are available for use in your country. Some international institutions, such as the WHO, and academic institutions, such as McGill University , have created instruments to track vaccine developments and approvals. Will COVID-19 vaccines provide long-term protection? Will other vaccines help protect me against COVID-19? What COVID-19 vaccines are currently available?
