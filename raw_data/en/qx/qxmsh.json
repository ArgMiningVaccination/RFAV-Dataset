Synthetic essential oils will harm your pet. That is why Dr. Geoghegan is extremely selective about the oils that she recommends and uses on her pets and patients. After performing extensive research, Dr. G chose to trust and represent doTERRA oils. doTERRA is internationally known as the industry leader in essential oil purity and quality. We are proud to have certified pure therapeutic-grade doTERRA oils in our holistic lifestyle center. How To Safely Use Essential Oil Therapy For Pets Diffusion is the most common use of essential oils. Pets are much more sensitive to aromatherapy because of their powerful nasal receptors. It's important to respect your pet's sense of smell, so please see the Resource section of the website to learn more about Dr. G's safety guidelines. Essential oils are highly concentrated, so they should only be used in small amounts and not around your pet's eyes. Dr. G recommends consulting with a trained veterinarian before using essential oils around your pet. "}
