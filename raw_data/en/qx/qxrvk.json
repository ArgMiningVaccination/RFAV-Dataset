Were you aware of the fact that the bottom areas of your feet have direct access points to all the internal organs in your body? As per Chinese medicine terminology, these access points are known as meridians, and they form the pathways to each organ in the body. There has been an age-old controversy regarding the existence of meridians, but those who are well versed with Chinese medicine know that the meridian system is very closely related to our body's nervous system. Experts say that there are about 7,000 meridians at the bottom of our feet that directly link to different organs! Can you believe that? The image below clearly represents the meridians and their connection points with the organs and systems within the body. These meridians act as powerful electric circuits within the body, but are often dormant as we mostly cover our feet with footwear. Stimulating these meridians is very important for our body to function healthily. To stimulate the bottom of our feet and to ground ourselves with the earth's negative ion field, it is always recommended to walk barefoot wherever and whenever you can! One of the coolest ways to stimulate these meridians is to put an [onion slice](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/amazing-health-benefits-of-onions/)inside your socks (at the bottom of your feet) and wear them to bed. It can give off a stinky, pungent smell but it really works.
