Cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) have been reported in adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine recipients. FINDINGS We reviewed all vaccine related CVT published cases by April 30, 2021. We assessed demographic, clinical variables and the interval between the vaccination and onset of headache. We assessed whether the presence of headache was associated with higher probability of death or intracranial hemorrhage. We identified 77 cases of CVT after COVID-19 vaccination. Patients' age was below 60 years in 74/77 (95.8%) cases and 61/68 (89.7%) were women. Headache was described in 38/77 (49.4%) cases, and in 35/38 (92.1%) was associated with other symptoms. Multiple organ thrombosis was reported in 19/77 (24.7%) (42.9%) cases and 19/77 (24.7%) patients died. The median time between vaccination and CVT- related headache onset was 8 (interquartile range 7.0-9.7) days. The presence of headache was associated with a higher odd of intracranial hemorrhage (OR 7.4; 95% CI: 95% CI: 0.18-1.47, p = 0.213). CONCLUSION Delayed onset of headache following an adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine is associated with development of CVT. Patients with new-onset headache, 1 week after vaccination with an adenovirus vector-based vaccine, should receive a thorough clinical evaluation and CVT must be ruled out.

The Journal of Headache and Pain (2021) 22:108 https://doi.org/10.1186/s10194-021-01324-5Introduction Headache is within the most frequent adverse effects following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) immunization. It is reported by approximately half of the vaccine recipients, both in clinical trials and real- world data [ 1,2]. Headache typically presents within the first 72 h post-vaccination and may be associated with additional symptoms, such as fatigue, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, or diarrhea [ 1,2]. Several cases of cerebral thrombosis (CVT) have been reported in COVID-19 vaccine recipients (Oxford-AstraZe- neca Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Janssen Ad26.COV2S) [ 3-7]. The association was based on the presence of thrombocytopenia [ 3-8], anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies [ cine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)) [ 3-8]. There was a higher mortality rate [ 3-8] than in other CVT series reported in the literature and an increased standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) in pa- tients aged between 30 and 49 [ 3]. SMR is also known as observed-to-expected analysis, which analyses the ratio between the observed number of cases in the population over the number of cases that would be expected based on the baseline incidence according to databases and prior studies [ 9,10]. Headache is the most frequent symptom in CVT, and it may occur isolated or accompanied by other symptoms [9-11]. As in other secondary headache disorders, CVT may be recognized by the presence of red flags [ 11,12]. Herein we highlight a potential novel red flag based on the available scientific data that may help clinicians to properly identify cases of CVT following non-replicant adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines. Methods This is an observational study with case-control design. The study population were vaccinated with non- replicant adenovirus vector-based vaccines. The case definition was CVT following COVID-19 non-replicant adenovirus vector-based vaccines. We screened PubMed for all published cases and case series between March 01 and April 30, 2021, and assessed specific reports from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention and the European Medicines Agency providing patient-level data. The search term is available in the supplementary appendix . We assessed and extracted the following variables, which are presented as descriptive statistics: age, sex, use of contraceptives or hormone- replacement therapy, presence of headache, presence of additional symptoms, the interval between the vaccin- ation and the first symptom, intracranial hemorrhage, and death. We compared the time elapsed between vaccination and the first clinical onset in patients withand without headache. As control group, we reviewed the United States Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) [ 2] reports under the symptom \"head- ache \"following COVID-19 vaccination up to April 30, 2021, assessing the number of days between the immunization and the headache onset. In the statistical analysis, we assessed whether the presence of headache in patients with CVT was associated with higher prob- ability of death or with higher probability of intracranial hemorrhage by univariate logistic regression, presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The statistical signification threshold was 0.05 and statis- tical tests were two-tailed. No statistical power calcula- tion was conducted prior to the study. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS version 26.0. Results We identified 77 cases of CVT included in eight publica- tions ( supplementary appendix ). Patients 'age was avail- able in 71 cases, and was below 40 in 46.5%, below 60 in 95.8% and between 60 and 69 years in 4.2% cases. The majority of cases 61/68 (89.7%) were women. Five (5.2%) patients used contraceptives and one (1.3%) received estrogen therapy. The median time between the vaccination and the first symptom was 8 days (inter-quartile range (IQR) 7-12, range 1 -19,n= 70). The presence of headache was described in 38/77 cases (49.4%). In 35/38 patients (92.1%), it was associated with other systemic or neurological symptoms. The CVT-related clinical symptoms started earlier in patients with headache (median 8, IQR 7 -9.7, range 2 -15) than in patients without headache (median 10, IQR 7 -12.2, range 1 - 19), ( P= 0.037, Mann-Whitney test). Figure 1shows the days elapsed between vaccination and headache onset. Intracranial hemorrhage was present in 33/77 (42.9%) cases, multiple location re- ported in 19/77 (24.7%) cases, and 19/77 (24.7%) died. In patients with CVT, the presence of headache was associated with the presence of intracranial hemorrhage (odds ratio -20.80, P< 0.001), 95% CI: 0.18 -1.47, P= a common symptom after vaccin- ation, it typically presents and resolves within the same day or a few days later [ 1,2]. CVT, and other thrombotic complications in adenovirus-based vaccine recipients share a unique feature, the delayed presentation. In most of the reported cases symptoms started 1 week after immunization. Headache was not described in detail in most cases, but in the few it was, it was reported asGarc\u00eda-Azor\u00edn et al. The Journal of Headache and Pain (2021) 22:108 Page 2 of 5severe, progressive and treatment-resistant, all of them well-known red flags [ 12]. Diagnostic delay is common in CVT [ 9]. Prompt treat- ment likely improves the clinical outcome, and therefore, every physician must be aware of the potential risk of vac- cine related thrombotic complications. Given this know- ledge and the possibility of vaccine-related CVT, patients with new-onset headache, 1 week after immunization, should receive a thorough clinical evaluation and be closely monitored. Non-contrast. computed tomography (CT) may detect indirect find- ings vein or infarcts, brain oedema and intracranial hemorrhages; however, the optimal imaging test in case of suspicion are contrast brain CT with CT venogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast and/or venogram, showing a filling defect in a venous sinus (empty delta sign) [ 10,13]. The pathophysiology of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome has been recently discussed [ 7,14,15]. The role of anti-platelet factor-4 antibodies seem causa- tive, inducing platelet activation, aggregation, thrombosis, leading to a severe platelet consumption and thrombocytopenia. According to the existing evi- dence, an interim guideline published by the World Health Organization (WHO) states that the treatment should include the treatment of the immune-mediated phenomenon and adequate anticoagulation according to the existing evidence [ 14]. For the first, intravenousimmunoglobulins seem to be the preferred option, while as anticoagulants, non-heparin-based anticoagulants must be used, while heparin-based anticoagulants and platelet infusion should be avoided [ 14]. Conclusion To conclude, delayed onset of headache following an adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine is associated with CVT. Patients with new-onset headache, 1 week after vaccination with an adenovirus vector-based vac- cine, should receive a thorough clinical evaluation and CVT must be considered in the diagnostic work-up.
