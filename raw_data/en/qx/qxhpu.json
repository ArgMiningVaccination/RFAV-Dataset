This pause and safety review shows our vaccine safety monitoring system is working,\" the Chicago Department of Public Health said in a statement late Friday, indicating the shot would be put back into use immediately. \"Millions of people have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine with no serious side effects and serious reactions are extremely rare.\" Local health authorities followed the feds in pausing use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine April 13 after reports that six women experienced blood clots weeks after receiving the shot. Ultimately, federal officials said they found 15 clotting cases amid nearly 8 million shots given. All were women, most under 50. Three died, and seven remained hospitalized as of Friday. On Saturday during a morning news conference held via Zoom, [Dr. Rachel Rubin](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-rachel-rubin-coronavirus-parents-cook-county-public-health-20210206-nqlpi663wngzdjcndcsqkduduq-story.html) of the Cook County Department of Public Health said the pause was an important step because it allowed time for physicians to learn how to treat anyone who has been inoculated showing signs of [the atypical clotting](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/04/23/fact-check-birth-control-vaccine-blood-clot-comparison-lacks-nuance/7256800002/). A normal course of treatment for clotting [could prove dangerous](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/blood-clots-and-the-johnson-johnson-vaccine-what-we-know-so-far/) to those who have been vaccinated, and more guidance for doctors is coming from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuesday, Rubin said. Anyone who received a Johnson & Johnson shot should seek medical attention from their health care providers if they are showing symptoms of clotting \u2014 trouble breathing, leg swelling, pain in the chest or abdomen and blurred vision \u2014 doctors said. Both Rubin and her co-lead, Dr. Kiran Joshi, said Americans should see the pause on the Johnson & Johnson shot as proof the government is taking complications very seriously and that the evidence it assembled during this period shows the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. At the same time, \"we don't want to force people into vaccines they're not comfortable with,\" Rubin said, stressing there are three options for vaccination for those who want to avoid the paused medicine. Both doctors felt the pause was worth it despite how it might be contributing to vaccine hesitancy and said many patients are specifically seeking out the Johnson & Johnson shot because of the ease of administration \u2014 one shot and done. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, they said, is particularly valuable for vaccinating those who are hesitant, or have trouble reaching mass vaccination sites or booking online because of its easier storage and handling requirements relative to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech jabs. Rubin said Cook County has begun to see some [\"softening\" of vaccine demand](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/coronavirus-vaccine-illinois-disparity-20210420-4zyu2mmesnagld5yrj3wf6ehza-story.html), even as they continue to give out thousands of shots per day. Some public health officials are concerned the U.S. [will soon reach the \"tipping point\" ](https://www.axios.com/vaccine-hesitancy-tipping-point-a41db61e-8736-4306-b415-2bfd81b8137a.html)when all enthusiastic shot seekers have been inoculated, leaving only skeptics and those who refuse. With that in mind, Cook County announced Saturday that mass vaccination sites will allow walk-ins with no previous appointments starting April 26 from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday. \"We're trying to make the right thing to do the easy thing to do,\" Joshi said. Sites in Tinley Park and Matteson started taking walk-ins on April 21. One group of doctors in Chicago, the Chicago Medical Society, suggested physicians should be taking the lead giving it out to hesitant patients, who will trust them more, and can ask questions and have a dialogue around the shot. \"The problem now is the public is afraid,\" Dr. Vishnu Chundi, chairman of the Chicago Medical Society's COVID-19 task force, [told the Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-covid-doctors-want-to-give-johnson-vaccine-20210424-5eye3vk63fec5aldury3a6k3aa-story.html). \"Johnson & Johnson has had all this bad press. The only person patients are going to trust is their doctor. Give the vaccine to the doctors to educate the public.\" As for when Cook County residents can relegate their masks to the bottom of the sock drawer? Rubin said it's possible masks will be mandated or recommended into 2022, but that it's too soon to tell for sure. Public health guidance will be driven by studying how effectively the vaccines curtail community spread of COVID-19, which depends in part on how the virus mutates \u2014 so-called variants. The more people who are vaccinated, the less likelihood of variants. It may be possible, Rubin said, masks would continue to be recommended when mixing with unrelated people in a crowd, such as at a baseball game or "}
