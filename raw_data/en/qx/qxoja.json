Williams, Ph.D., Extension Specialist in Equine Management; Wayne Crans, Ph.D., Research Professor in Entomology; and Jennifer Gruener, Graduate Assistant in Entomology. Q. What is West Nile virus? A. West Nile virus (WNV) is an old world mosquito-borne pathogen that appeared unexpectantly in the New York metropolitan area in the fall of 1999. The disease was first thought to be St. Louis encephalitis, a closely related mosquito-borne virus that is relatively common in the continental United States. Virus isolations from wild crows, which were dying from the disease throughout the New York-metropolitan area, as well as captive birds from the Bronx Zoo prompted the USDA's National Veterinarian Services Laboratories to investigate. In late September 1999, CDC officials announced that the virus appeared to be West Nile virus, a pathogen previously unseen in the Western Hemisphere. Avian cases were quickly linked to a series of human ailments in the New York City area that ultimately produced 62 human cases of WNV with 7 deaths. The virus was recognized as an important pathogen of horses as it spread from its eastern focus, affecting large numbers of animals as it moved westward. West Nile virus reached the west coast of the United States in 2002 and was responsible for more than 14,000 diagnosed equine cases that year. A. West Nile virus is a disease of wild birds that is maintained in the avian population by mosquitoes that use birds as their preferred blood meal hosts. The Northern House Mosquito, Culex pipiens, is an important bird-feeding species that perpetuates WNV in urban areas as well as farm settings throughout the northeastern United States. WNV is transmitted to humans and horses by mosquitoes that occasionally bite birds but normally use mammals as their preferred blood meal hosts. Culex pipiens may be directly responsible for some human and equine infection, but mammal biters are thought to produce the majority of WNV cases each year. A. Horses contract WNV when a mosquito that has previously fed on an infected bird bites them. Birds circulate high levels of the pathogen in their blood and serve as the sole source of the virus for mosquitoes. Neither horses nor humans circulate enough virus in their blood when they acquire the disease to pass the virus back to mosquitoes. West Nile virus cannot be spread directly from horse to horse or from horse to human. A mosquito that has previously fed on an infected bird is required in all cases. A. West Nile virus is at its lowest levels in early spring and builds in intensity as the summer season progresses. Infected mosquitoes are rarely found in large numbers until the month of August. Most transmission to horses takes place during late summer into fall, the same time that infection rates peak in mosquitoes and birds. Horses that have not been protected through proper vaccination may contract the infection at this time of year. A. West Nile virus is a serious threat to horses. In New Jersey, even though WNV affected only a small percentage of the equine population, the mortality rate of those infected from 2000 to 2003 was 34%. A. Infected horses may display one or more of the following symptoms: Lack of coordination and stumbling (most commonly described symptom), depression or apprehension, anorexia (off feed), weakness of the hind limbs, falling down, inability to rise, flaccid paralysis of the lower lip (droopy lip), muscle twitching, grinding teeth, inability to swallow, head pressing, colicky appearance, aimless wandering, hypersensitivity and excitability, excessive sweating, disorientation, convulsions, and possible total paralysis. A. Call your veterinarian immediately. Prompt treatment may be life-saving! A. No. Horses are humanely euthanized only when the viral infection is so severe they will not be able to recover. For those that survive, a full recovery is likely. About two out of every three horses that become ill will survive. A. No. Since infected horses are not carriers for the disease, quarantine is not necessary. A. You can significantly reduce the risk of West Nile virus to your horses by taking the following steps: 2. Contact your local county mosquito control agency: 3. Reduce local mosquito populations: Concentrate on the recommendations above instead of using minimally effective mosquito control measures: e.g., fly sheets and masks; repellents for long term control; fly misters; bug zappers. Q. Do mosquitoes only bite at dusk and dawn? A. No. Most species of mosquitoes seek blood meals at dusk and dawn, but many species are day biters and some are nocturnal. Recommendations for turnout cannot be made until the species that transmit WNV to horses have been identified. Q. Is there a vaccine for West Nile virus? A. Yes, there are two intramuscular vaccines available for horses. The original vaccine and the most common is West Nile-INNOVATORTM vaccine, manufactured by Fort Dodge Animal Health, a division of Wyeth. More recently Merial, a division of Merck and Aventis Companies, has developed RECOMBITEK\u00ae Equine West Nile Virus Vaccine, a vaccine using recombinant DNA. Vaccination of all healthy horses is strongly recommended. The West Nile-INNOVATORTM vaccine requires two injections, spaced three to six weeks apart. This part is critical in order for the vaccine to take its full effect. Immunity may not develop for four to six weeks after the second injection. A booster is recommended every six months to continue protection. In New Jersey 44% of the infected horses were not vaccinated, 21% had an unknown vaccination record and 27% were vaccinated improperly (including missing the three to six week window). The vaccination has been shown to be 93 to 95% effective. Some early reports in 2002 suggested that the Fort Dodge West Nile virus vaccine, approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), may cause pregnant mares to abort or give birth to deformed foals. The misleading information in those articles has sparked many anxious phone calls from horse owners, veterinarians, and others involved with horses. As a result, some horse owners choose not to use the effective preventive measure against West Nile virus available to them. The USDA continues to recommend use of the approved vaccine as protection against West Nile virus. Millions of doses of the Fort Dodge vaccine have been used since the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics approved its use in 2001. The Center for Veterinary Biologics, within the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, maintains a toll-free telephone hotline (800-752-6255) and a mailbox on its web site, www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/cvb, and actively encourages veterinarians and other vaccine consumers to report problems with vaccines. The Center and the vaccine manufacturer will continue to collect, monitor, and track the performance of this vaccine. Q. What is the proper method of vaccinating horses for West Nile virus? A. Previously Unvaccinated Horses Previously Vaccinated Horses Q. Where can I get more information about West Nile virus? A. Local mosquito surveillance and control information is available from your county mosquito control agency, and specific questions regarding WNV may be addressed to your local health department or for any animal health related issues contact the NJ Department of Agriculture.
