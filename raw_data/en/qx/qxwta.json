(Okay, that does sound a little hippy.) Like essential oils, crystals have a variety of uses and applications, ranging from insomnia treatment to pain relief. Healing crystals, also known as healing stones, have been used for centuries to promote wellness and balance. One popular crystal is rose quartz, which is believed to have healing properties related to love and relationships. These healing stones are thought to absorb negative energy and promote positive energy, which can help to balance the body and mind. Each crystal is believed to have its own unique properties and meanings, which can vary depending on the culture and tradition. For example, rose quartz is often associated with the heart chakra and is believed to promote self-love, compassion, and forgiveness. It is also said to attract love and harmony in relationships. Other popular healing crystals include amethyst, which is believed to promote relaxation and relieve stress, and citrine, which is thought to promote abundance and success. 12 Healing Crystals Some stones and crystals are said to align with our [7 chakras](https://helloglow.co/guide-to-chakras/) (still with me?) and heal maladies in the associated areas of our bodies. They vibrate at frequencies similar to the body chakras, which helps to align their energy. Since crystals work in the energetic realm to adjust imbalances and heal, they can also increase your energy or bust a bad mood. Simply keeping crystals in your environment can do the trick, but you can also wear them. Try [ making jewelry](https://helloglow.co/diy-crystal-bracelet/) or place them on your body to harness their healing powers.

How to Use Your Crystals Many people incorporate crystals into their meditation practices by resting a stone upon their yoga mat or near their meditation cushion, or by holding it in the cup of the hand when seated. Gems can also be laid upon the body when in a reclined meditation. Crystals can be carried in a pouch with you throughout the day, in your pocket to be held when you need to feel calm or balanced, or as jewelry. Another common practice, according to some of my crystal enthusiast friends, is to wear your stone on a necklace or tucked inside of your bra\u2014close to your heart and circulatory center. You may choose to carry the stone on or near the associated chakra or area of your body that needs attention to focus its healing power. You can also use crystals to settle the environments around you. Keeping a positive energy stone in your car or at your desk at work can assist in keeping some heavier negative vibes at bay. And placing larger stones around your home can help promote the feelings of a healthy, balanced space. Place a clear crystal in each of the four corners of your home to encourage stability and protection. Crystal Care When you first bring your crystals home, it's a good idea to give them a [good cleaning](https://helloglow.co/how-to-charge-crystals/). You'll also want to cleanse the crystals that absorb negative energy on a regular basis. Keep your stones dust-free, and give them a wash in salt water if needed. Cleansing the accumulated energies of the stones can be done by placing them in a bowl of dry salt for a few hours, by setting them outside overnight under the high-octane energy of the full moon, or by [ smudging them with sage](https://helloglow.co/what-is-smudging-how-to-smudge/) or [ palo santo](http://amzn.to/2ECCPID) smoke. Whether you subscribe to the idea that crystals hold these superpowers or not, using stones that encourage positive emotional states and feelings of wellbeing could be seen more as a mindfulness practice. They can help to bring positive thoughts into your mind and a focus on certain imbalances of thought that translate out to your energy patterns. Choose stones that relate to concepts you are working on. Whenever you reach into your pocket and feel the curve of your rose quartz, for example, you may be reminded that your heart is healing and direct your thoughts accordingly. When you feel the warm, round weight of the onyx, you may be more open to receiving the message that you are supported and that you belong. Want more crystal power?
