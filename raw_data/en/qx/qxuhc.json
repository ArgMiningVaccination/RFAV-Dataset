For example, the [standard medical care for dehydration](https://medlineplus.gov/dehydration.html#:~:text=The%20treatment%20for%20dehydration%20is,oral%20rehydration%20solutions%20for%20children.) is replacing the fluids and electrolytes that were lost. On the opposite end of standard medical care is complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). These treatments are used in conjunction with standard medical care and their [goal is to support and enhance the patient's quality of life and wellbeing](https://www.cancer.org.au/cancer-information/treatment/complementary-therapies). Why CAM is on the rise Some common types of CAM are massage, acupuncture, aromatherapy, and art/music therapy. When it comes to types of complementary and alternative medicines that may be used during cancer treatment, meditation, reflexology, and talk therapy are also high on the list. The number of cancer patients who use CAM is on the rise. A [survey of 468 cancer patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9336131/) showed that 79% of them used at least one type of complementary or alternative medicine. This same survey reported that the number one reason for this use was to improve their quality of life while coping with cancer/relaxation was the second reason. In addition to these statistics, Beekley Medical attended The Radiation Oncology Summit \"ACRO 2023\", where we had discussions with multiple radiation oncologists who are looking for non-pharmacological alternatives to offer their patients, especially in the midst of the [opioid crisis](https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/basics/epidemic.html) that is plaguing the United States. In fact, the [number of Medicaid prescriptions for opioids dropped 27%](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/a-look-at-changes-in-opioid-prescribing-patterns-in-medicaid-from-2016-to-2019/#:~:text=Key%20findings%20include%20the%20following,opioids%20used%20to%20treat%20pain.) from 2016 to 2019. Medicaid credits this decline to the fact that prescribers are trying to take serious action in fighting the opioid epidemic. For example, states in the Appalachian area of the country had the biggest decrease in opioid prescriptions and have been labeled the \"hardest hit\" during the epidemic for the past few years. The role of clinical aromatherapy in cancer care [One type of non-pharmacological complementary therapy is aromatherapy ](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/aromatherapy-pdq#:~:text=Aromatherapy%20is%20the%20use%20of%20essential%20oils%20from%20plants%20to,by%20cancer%20and%20its%20treatment.)- the use of essential oils to improve the mind, body, and spirit. [Cancer patients have been known to use it](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/aromatherapy-pdq#:~:text=Aromatherapy%20is%20the%20use%20of%20essential%20oils%20from%20plants%20to,by%20cancer%20and%20its%20treatment.) to improve their quality of life and to reduce pain, stress, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting caused by cancer and its treatments. There have been [multiple clinical trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746639/) that suggest the use of aromatherapy during cancer treatment can reduce anxiety and depression, as well as improve sleep and increase the patient's overall wellbeing.
