The age-old adage is making a comeback as more and more people are turning toward preventive care rather than reactive medicine. Alternative health expert [Bryce Wylde](https://twitter.com/WyldeOnHealth) joined us recently to talk about the hottest trends in natural medicine. 1. Sea Vegetables Fatigue is one of the most common complaints today and it's possible we're not getting enough nutrients from food. So, researchers are turning toward the sea for answers. With all kinds of micro nutrients, sea vegetables are mostly rich in chicoric acid, which has immune enhancing, healing and anti-aging properties. Look for chlorella in your local health store. It's a great source of protein, fats, carbohydrates, fibre, chlorophyll, vitamins, and minerals. 2. New delivery system called 'delivra' Bryce says inflammation is a medical buzz word these days. It is an underlying cause for most diseases. A new breakthrough medical technology has researchers taking anti-inflammatory nutrients from barley, oranges and horse chestnut through our skin versus taking it orally. The new system called 'delivra' allows nutrients to get through our skin. Look for the 'delivra' system while shopping at a health store 3. DAO Supplements Diamine Oxidase, DAO, is essentially an enzyme that breaks down histamine in histamine rich foods. When you have less DAO, it leads to food sensitivity. For some folks, who have genetic issues or inflammatory bowel issues, getting rid of histamine in your diet is a great first step. But if you have tried cutting out essential foods and tried various tests, you can now try taking DAO Supplements. 4. Melatonin Melatonin is the new Vitamin D. With more and more people getting less and less sleep, Melatonin supplements have become popular as natural sleep aids. These supplements also have other benefits like being anti-aging and also double up as an anti-oxidant. Bryce suggests you should get yourself tested for Melatonin levels. You can use the kit available [online](http://www.wyldeabouthealth.com/mystatus). If you're someone who has trouble staying asleep you can take pills but if you're someone who has trouble falling asleep, take the liquid. The average person (who hasn't tested themselves) should take 3 mg per 50 pounds of body weight). "}
