One of the [coinage metals](/wiki/index.php?title=Coinage_metal&action=edit&redlink=1), it occurs as [nuggets](/wiki/Gold_nugget) or grains in rocks and in [alluvial deposits](/wiki/Alluvial_deposit). It is a soft, shiny, yellow, dense, malleable, and ductile (trivalent and univalent) [transition metal](/wiki/Transition_metal). Modern industrial uses include [dentistry](/wiki/index.php?title=Dentistry&action=edit&redlink=1) and [electronics](/wiki/Electronics). Gold is the basis for a [monetary standard](/wiki/Gold_standard) used by the [International Monetary Fund](/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund) (IMF) and the [Bank for International Settlements](/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements) (BIS). Its [ISO currency code](/wiki/index.php?title=ISO_4217&action=edit&redlink=1) is XAU. Gold is a [chemical element](/wiki/Chemical_elements), typically found as a [solid](/wiki/Solid_(state_of_matter)) in its elemental form. It has the [chemical symbol](/wiki/Chemical_symbol) Au (from the Latin aurum; the adjective auric refers to something made of gold), [atomic number](/wiki/Atomic_number) (number of [protons](/wiki/Protons)) Z = 79, and a [standard atomic weight](/wiki/Atomic_mass#Standard_atomic_weights_of_the_elements) of 196.96655 g/mol. Gold does not react with most chemicals but is attacked by [chlorine](/wiki/Chlorine), [fluorine](/wiki/Fluorine), [aqua regia](/wiki/index.php?title=Aqua_regia&action=edit&redlink=1) and [cyanide](/wiki/index.php?title=Cyanide&action=edit&redlink=1). Gold dissolves particular, gold is insoluble in [nitric acid](/wiki/index.php?title=Nitric_acid&action=edit&redlink=1), which will dissolve most other metals, so nitric acid has long been used to confirm the presence of gold in items. Notable characteristics Gold is a metallic element with a characteristic yellow color, but can be black or ruby when finely divided, while [colloidal](/wiki/index.php?title=Colloid&action=edit&redlink=1) solutions are intensely colored and often purple. These colors are the result of gold's [plasmon frequency](/wiki/index.php?title=Plasmon_frequency&action=edit&redlink=1) lying in the visible range, which causes red and yellow light to be reflected, and blue light to be absorbed. Only silver colloids exhibit the same interactions with light, albeit at a shorter frequency, making silver colloids yellow in color. It is the most [malleable](/wiki/index.php?title=Malleable&action=edit&redlink=1) and [ductile](/wiki/index.php?title=Ductility&action=edit&redlink=1) metal known; a single [gram](/wiki/Gram) can be beaten into a sheet of one square [metre](/wiki/Metre), or an [ounce](/wiki/index.php?title=Ounce&action=edit&redlink=1) into 300 [square feet](/wiki/index.php?title=Square_foot&action=edit&redlink=1). Gold readily forms alloys with many other metals. These alloys can be produced to increase the hardness or to create exotic colors. Adding [copper](/wiki/Copper) yields a redder metal, [iron](/wiki/Iron) blue, [aluminium](/wiki/Aluminium) purple, [platinum](/wiki/Platinum) metals white, and natural [bismuth](/wiki/Bismuth) together with silver alloys produce black. Native gold contains usually 8-10% [silver](/wiki/Silver), but often much more \u2014 alloys with a silver content over 20% are called [electrum](/wiki/index.php?title=Electrum&action=edit&redlink=1). As the amount of silver increases, the color becomes whiter and the [specific gravity](/wiki/index.php?title=Relative_density&action=edit&redlink=1) becomes lower. Gold is a good conductor of [heat](/wiki/Heat) and [electricity](/wiki/Electricity), and is not affected by [air](/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere) and most [reagents](/wiki/index.php?title=Reagent&action=edit&redlink=1). Heat, moisture, [oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen), and most [corrosive](/wiki/index.php?title=Corrosion&action=edit&redlink=1) agents have very little effect on gold, making it well-suited for use in coins and [jewelry](/wiki/Jewelry); conversely, [halogens](/wiki/Halogen) will chemically alter gold, and [aqua regia](/wiki/index.php?title=Aqua_regia&action=edit&redlink=1) dissolves it. Common [oxidation states](/wiki/Oxidation_state) of or +3 (gold(III) or auric Gold ions in solution are readily [reduced](/wiki/index.php?title=Reduction_(chemistry)&action=edit&redlink=1) and [precipitated](/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)) out as gold metal by the addition of virtually any other metal as the reducing agent. The added metal is [oxidized](/wiki/Oxidation) and dissolves, allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate. Recent research undertaken by Frank Reith of the Australian National University shows that microbes play an important role in the formation of gold deposits, transporting and precipitating gold to form grains and nuggets that collect in alluvial deposits. [[1]](#cite_note-1) The concentration of free electrons in gold metal is 5.9\u00d71022 cm-3. Applications Pure gold is too soft for ordinary use and is hardened by [alloying](/wiki/index.php?title=Alloy&action=edit&redlink=1) with silver, copper, or other metals. Gold and its many alloys are most often used in [jewelry](/wiki/Jewelry), [coinage](/wiki/index.php?title=Coin&action=edit&redlink=1) and as a standard for [monetary](/wiki/Money) exchange in various countries. When selling it in the form of jewelry, gold is measured in [karats](/wiki/index.php?title=Carat_(purity)&action=edit&redlink=1) (k), with pure gold being 24k. However, it is more commonly sold in lower measurements of 22k, 18k, and 14k. A lower \"k\" indicates a higher percent of copper or silver mixed into the alloy, with copper being the more commonly used metal between the two. Fourteen-karat gold-copper alloy will be nearly identical in color to certain [bronze](/wiki/index.php?title=Bronze&action=edit&redlink=1) alloys, and both may be used to produce police and other badges. Eighteen-karat gold with a high copper content is found in some antique jewelry and will have a distinct, though not dominant, copper cast, giving an attractively warm color. A similar karat weight when alloyed with silvery metals will appear less warm in color, and some low karat white metal alloys may be sold as \"white gold\", silvery in appearance with a sightly yellow cast but far more resistant to corrosion than silver or [sterling silver](/wiki/index.php?title=Sterling_silver&action=edit&redlink=1). Karat weights of twenty and higher are more common in modern jewelry. Because of its high electrical conductivity and resistance to corrosion and other desirable combinations of physical and chemical properties, gold also emerged in the late 20th century as an essential industrial metal, particularly as a thin plating on electrical card contacts and connectors. - Gold can be made into [thread](/wiki/index.php?title=Gold_thread&action=edit&redlink=1)and used in [embroidery](/wiki/index.php?title=Embroidery&action=edit&redlink=1). - Gold performs critical functions in computers, communications equipment, spacecraft, jet aircraft engines, and a host of other products. - The resistance to oxidation of gold has led to its widespread use as thin layers [electroplated](/wiki/index.php?title=Electroplating&action=edit&redlink=1)on the surface of electrical connectors to ensure a good connection. - Gold is used in restorative dentistry especially in tooth restorations such as [crowns](/wiki/index.php?title=Crown_(dentistry)&action=edit&redlink=1)and permanent [bridges](/wiki/index.php?title=Bridge_(dentistry)&action=edit&redlink=1)as its slight malleablity makes a superior molar mating surface to other teeth, unlike a harder ceramic crown. Use of gold crowns in more prominent teeth such as incisors is favored in some cultures and discouraged in others. [Colloidal gold](/wiki/index.php?title=Colloidal_gold&action=edit&redlink=1)(a gold [nanoparticle](/wiki/Nanoparticle)) is an intensely [colored](/wiki/Color)solution that is currently studied in many labs for medical, biological and other applications. It is also the form used as gold paint on [ceramics](/wiki/index.php?title=Ceramic&action=edit&redlink=1)prior to firing. [Chlorauric acid](/wiki/index.php?title=Chlorauric_acid&action=edit&redlink=1)is used in [photography](/wiki/Photography)for toning used as a [catalyst](/wiki/Catalyst)in [organic chemistry](/wiki/Organic_chemistry). It is also the usual starting point for making other gold [compounds](/wiki/index.php?title=Inorganic_compound&action=edit&redlink=1). - Gold is used as a coating enabling biological material to be viewed under a [scanning electron microscope](/wiki/index.php?title=Scanning_electron_microscope&action=edit&redlink=1). - Many competitions and honors, such as the [Olympics](/wiki/Olympic_Games)and the [Nobel Prize](/wiki/Nobel_Prize), award a gold [medal](/wiki/index.php?title=Medal&action=edit&redlink=1)to the winner (with [silver](/wiki/Silver)to the second-place finisher, and [bronze](/wiki/index.php?title=Bronze&action=edit&redlink=1)to the third.) - Since it is a good reflector of both infrared and visible light, it is used for the protective coatings on many artificial [satellites](/wiki/Satellite)and on astronauts' helmets to prevent blindness from the sun. [Disodium aurothiomalate](/wiki/index.php?title=Disodium_aurothiomalate&action=edit&redlink=1)is a treatment for rheumatoid [arthritis](/wiki/Arthritis)(administered intramuscularly). It [reactive oxygen species](/wiki/index.php?title=Reactive_oxygen_species&action=edit&redlink=1)from [macrophages](/wiki/Macrophage), [IL-1](/wiki/index.php?title=IL-1&action=edit&redlink=1)production. However, it can also [kidney](/wiki/Kidney)damage. - The isotope [half-life](/wiki/Half-life): 2.7 days) is used in some [cancer](/wiki/Cancer)treatments and for treating other diseases. - Gold flake (called [varak](/wiki/index.php?title=Varak&action=edit&redlink=1), or varaq, in [India](/wiki/India)) is used on and in some gourmet sweets and drinks. Having no reactivity it adds no taste but is taken as a delicacy. Some use it as an excuse to create super-expensive delicacies ($1,000 cocktails). For similar reasons, it is also used as the basis for some superstitious, over the top, health claims. Only the salts and radioisotopes (mentioned above) have any evidence of medicinal value. [White gold](/wiki/index.php?title=White_gold&action=edit&redlink=1)(an alloy of gold with [platinum](/wiki/Platinum), [palladium](/wiki/Palladium), [nickel](/wiki/Nickel), and/or [zinc](/wiki/Zinc)) serves as a substitute for platinum. - Green gold (a gold/silver alloy) is used in specialized jewelry while gold alloys with copper (reddish color) are more widely used for that purpose ( [rose gold](/wiki/index.php?title=Rose_gold&action=edit&redlink=1)). History Gold has been highly valued since prehistoric times, for ornamentation and rituals, and may have been the first metal used by [humans](/wiki/Human). [Egyptian hieroglyphs](/wiki/index.php?title=Egyptian_hieroglyph&action=edit&redlink=1) from 2600 BC describe gold, which king [Tushratta](/wiki/index.php?title=Tushratta&action=edit&redlink=1) of the [Mitanni](/wiki/index.php?title=Mitanni&action=edit&redlink=1) claimed was as \"common as dust\". Egypt and [Nubia](/wiki/index.php?title=Nubia&action=edit&redlink=1) had the resources to make them major gold-producing areas for much of history. Gold is also mentioned several times in the [Old Testament](/wiki/Old_Testament). The south-east corner of the [Black Sea](/wiki/Black_Sea) was famed for its gold. Exploitation is said to date from the time of [Midas](/wiki/index.php?title=Midas&action=edit&redlink=1), and this gold was important in what is probably the world's earliest coinage, in [Lydia](/wiki/index.php?title=Lydia&action=edit&redlink=1) between 643 and 630 BC. The European exploration of the Americas was fueled in part by reports of the gold ornaments displayed in profusion by [Native American](/wiki/index.php?title=Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas&action=edit&redlink=1) peoples, especially in [Central America](/wiki/Central_America), [Peru](/wiki/Peru), and [Colombia](/wiki/Colombia). Gold has long been considered one of the most [precious metals](/wiki/Precious_metal), and its value has been used as the standard for many [currencies](/wiki/index.php?title=Currency&action=edit&redlink=1) (known as the [gold standard](/wiki/Gold_standard)) in history. Gold has been used as a symbol for purity, value and royalty (see [gold album](/wiki/index.php?title=Gold_album&action=edit&redlink=1)). Gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was made fun of by [Thomas More](/wiki/index.php?title=Thomas_More&action=edit&redlink=1) in his treatise [Utopia](/wiki/index.php?title=Utopia_(book)&action=edit&redlink=1). On that imaginary island, gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves, tableware and lavatory-seats. When ambassadors from other countries arrive, dressed in ostentatious gold jewels and badges, the Utopians mistake them for menial servants, paying homage instead to the most modestly-dressed of their party. There is an age-old tradition of biting gold in order to test its authenticity. The bite test should score the gold because gold is considered a soft metal according to the [Mohs' scale of mineral hardness](/wiki/Mohs%27_scale). The purer the gold the easier it should be to mark it. Painted lead can cheat this test because lead is softer than gold. Gold in antiquity was relatively easy to obtain geologically; however, 75% of all gold ever produced has been extracted since 1910. [[2]](#cite_note-2) It has been estimated that all the gold in the world that has ever been refined would form a single cube [20 m](/wiki/index.php?title=1_E2_m&action=edit&redlink=1) (66 ft) a side (8000 m\u00b3). The primary goal of the [alchemists](/wiki/index.php?title=Alchemy&action=edit&redlink=1) was to produce gold from other substances, such as [lead](/wiki/Lead) \u2014 presumably by the interaction with a mythical substance called the [philosopher's stone](/wiki/index.php?title=Philosopher%27s_stone&action=edit&redlink=1). Although they never succeeded in this attempt, the alchemists promoted an interest in what can be done with substances, and this laid a foundation for today's [chemistry](/wiki/Chemistry). Their symbol for gold was the [circle with a point at its center](/wiki/index.php?title=Circle_with_a_point_at_its_centre&action=edit&redlink=1) (), which was also the [astrological](/wiki/Astrology) symbol, the [Egyptian](/wiki/Egypt) [hieroglyph](/wiki/index.php?title=Egyptian_hieroglyph&action=edit&redlink=1) and the ancient [Chinese character](/wiki/Chinese_character) for the Sun. For modern attempts to produce artificial gold, see [gold synthesis](/wiki/index.php?title=Gold_synthesis&action=edit&redlink=1). In the 19th century, [gold rushes](/wiki/index.php?title=Gold_rush&action=edit&redlink=1) occurred whenever large gold deposits were [Colorado](/wiki/index.php?title=Colorado_gold_rush&action=edit&redlink=1), [Otago](/wiki/index.php?title=Central_Otago_goldrush&action=edit&redlink=1), [Australian](/wiki/index.php?title=Australian_gold_rushes&action=edit&redlink=1), [Witwatersrand](/wiki/index.php?title=Witwatersrand&action=edit&redlink=1), [Black Hills](/wiki/Black_Hills), and [Klondike](/wiki/index.php?title=Klondike,_Yukon&action=edit&redlink=1) gold rushes. Because of its historically high value, much of the gold mined throughout history is still in circulation in one form or another. Occurrence Due to its relative chemical inertness, gold is usually found as the native metal or alloy. Occasionally large accumulations of native gold (also known as [nuggets](/wiki/Gold_nugget)) occur but usually gold occurs as minute grains. These grains occur between mineral grain boundaries or as inclusions within minerals. Common gold associations are [quartz](/wiki/index.php?title=Quartz&action=edit&redlink=1) often as [veins](/wiki/index.php?title=Vein&action=edit&redlink=1) and sulfide minerals. The [muthmannite](/wiki/index.php?title=Muthmannite&action=edit&redlink=1), [nagyagite](/wiki/index.php?title=Nagyagite&action=edit&redlink=1) [krennerite](/wiki/index.php?title=Krennerite&action=edit&redlink=1). Gold is widely distributed in the Earth's [crust](/wiki/index.php?title=Crust_(geology)&action=edit&redlink=1) at a background level of 0.03 [g](/wiki/Gram)/1000 [kg](/wiki/Kilogram) (0.03 [Parts per million](/wiki/Parts_per_million) by weight). [Hydrothermal](/wiki/index.php?title=Hydrothermal&action=edit&redlink=1) ore rocks](/wiki/index.php?title=Igneous_rock&action=edit&redlink=1); [alluvial deposits](/wiki/Alluvial_deposit) and [placer deposits](/wiki/index.php?title=Placer_deposit&action=edit&redlink=1) originate from these sources. The primary source of gold is usually igneous rocks or surface concentrations. A deposit usually needs some form of secondary enrichment to form an economically viable ore deposit: either chemical or physical processes like [erosion](/wiki/index.php?title=Erosion&action=edit&redlink=1) or solution or more generally [metamorphism](/wiki/index.php?title=Metamorphism&action=edit&redlink=1), which concentrates the gold in sulfide minerals or quartz. There are several primary deposit types: common ones are termed reef or vein. Primary deposits can be weathered and eroded, with most of the gold being transported into stream beds where it congregates with other heavy minerals to form placer deposits. In all these deposits the gold is in its native form. Another important ore type is in [sedimentary](/wiki/index.php?title=Sedimentary&action=edit&redlink=1) black [shale](/wiki/index.php?title=Shale&action=edit&redlink=1) and [limestone](/wiki/index.php?title=Limestone&action=edit&redlink=1) deposits containing finely disseminated gold and other [platinum group metals](/wiki/index.php?title=Platinum_group_metals&action=edit&redlink=1). Gold occurs in sea water at 0.1 to 2 [milligrams](/wiki/index.php?title=Milligram&action=edit&redlink=1) per [tonne](/wiki/Tonne) (0.1 to 2 [parts per billion](/wiki/Parts_per_billion) by weight), depending on sample location. Production Economic [gold extraction](/wiki/index.php?title=Gold_extraction&action=edit&redlink=1) can be achieved from ore grades as little as 0.5 g/1000 kg (0.5 [ppm](/wiki/Ppm)) on average in large easily mined deposits; typical ore grades in [open-pit](/wiki/index.php?title=Open-pit_mining&action=edit&redlink=1) mines are 1-5 g/1000 kg (1-5 ppm), ore grades in underground or [hard rock](/wiki/index.php?title=Hard_rock_mining&action=edit&redlink=1) mines are usually at least 3 g/1000 kg (3 ppm) on average. Ore grades of 30 g/1000 kg (30 ppm) are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye, so in most gold mines you will not see any gold. Since the 1880s, [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa) has been the source for a large proportion of the world's gold supply. Production in 1970 accounted for 79% of the world supply, producing about 1,000 [tonnes](/wiki/Tonne). However, production in 2004 was 342 tonnes. This decline was due to the increasing difficulty of extraction and changing economic factors affecting the industry in South Africa. The city of [Johannesburg](/wiki/index.php?title=Johannesburg&action=edit&redlink=1) was built atop the world's greatest gold finds. Gold fields in the [Free State](/wiki/index.php?title=Free_State&action=edit&redlink=1) and [Gauteng](/wiki/index.php?title=Gauteng&action=edit&redlink=1) provinces are deep and require the world's deepest mines. The [Second Boer War](/wiki/index.php?title=Second_Boer_War&action=edit&redlink=1) of 1899-1901 between the [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire) and the [Afrikaner](/wiki/index.php?title=Afrikaner&action=edit&redlink=1) [Boers](/wiki/index.php?title=Boers&action=edit&redlink=1) was at least partly over the rights of miners and possession of the gold wealth in South Africa. Other major producers are [Canada](/wiki/Canada), [United States of America](/wiki/United_States_of_America) and [Australia](/wiki/Australia). Mines in [South Dakota](/wiki/South_Dakota_(U.S._state)) and [Nevada](/wiki/Nevada_(U.S._state)) supply two-thirds of gold used in the United States. [Siberian](/wiki/index.php?title=Siberian&action=edit&redlink=1) regions of [Russia](/wiki/Russia) also used to be significant in the global gold mining industry. The town of [Kolar](/wiki/index.php?title=Kolar&action=edit&redlink=1) was built on the greatest gold deposits in [India](/wiki/India). In South America, the controversial project [Pascua Lama](/wiki/index.php?title=Pascua_Lama&action=edit&redlink=1) aims at exploitation of rich fields in the high mountains of [Atacama](/wiki/index.php?title=Atacama&action=edit&redlink=1), at the border between [Chile](/wiki/Chile) and [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina). Today about one-quarter of the world gold output is estimated to originate from artisanal or small scale mining. After initial production, gold is often subsequently refined industrially by the [Wohlwill process](/wiki/index.php?title=Wohlwill_process&action=edit&redlink=1) or the [Miller process](/wiki/index.php?title=Miller_process&action=edit&redlink=1). Other methods of assaying and purifying smaller amounts of gold include [parting and inquartation](/wiki/index.php?title=Parting_and_inquartation&action=edit&redlink=1) as well as [cuppelation](/wiki/index.php?title=Cuppelation&action=edit&redlink=1), or refining methods based on the dissolution of gold in [aqua regia](/wiki/index.php?title=Aqua_regia&action=edit&redlink=1). The world's oceans hold a vast amount of gold, but in very low concentrations (perhaps 1-2 parts per billion). Fritz Haber, the German inventor of the [Haber process](/wiki/Haber_process), attempted commercial extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay Germany's reparations following the [First World War](/wiki/World_War_I). Unfortunately, his assessment of the concentration of gold in sea water was unduly high, probably due to sample contamination. The effort produced little gold and cost the German government far more than the commercial value of the gold recovered. No commercially viable mechanism for performing gold extraction from sea water has yet been identified. Gold synthesis is not economically viable and is unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future. The average gold mining and extraction costs are $238 per [troy ounce](/wiki/index.php?title=Troy_ounce&action=edit&redlink=1) but these can vary widely depending on mining type and ore quality. In 2008, global mine production amounted to 2,209 tonnes, or 60% of total gold demand in that year. [[3]](#cite_note-3) As of 2008, the best available estimates indicate that the total volume of gold mined over history is approximately 158,000 tonnes. [[4]](#cite_note-4) Price Like other precious metals, gold is measured by [troy weight](/wiki/U.S._customary_units#Units_of_weight) and by grams. When it is alloyed with other metals the term [carat](/wiki/index.php?title=Carat_(purity)&action=edit&redlink=1) or karat is used to indicate the percentage of gold present, with 24 karats being pure (100%) gold and lower ratings proportionally less. The purity of a [gold bar](/wiki/index.php?title=Gold_bar&action=edit&redlink=1) can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from 0 to 1, known as the [millesimal fineness](/wiki/index.php?title=Millesimal_fineness&action=edit&redlink=1), such as 0.995. The price of gold is determined on the open market, but a procedure known as the [Gold Fixing](/wiki/index.php?title=Gold_Fixing&action=edit&redlink=1) in [London](/wiki/London), originating in 1919, provides a twice-daily benchmark figure to the industry. Historically gold was used to back currency; in an economic system known as the [gold standard](/wiki/Gold_standard), a certain [weight](/wiki/Weight) of gold was given the name of a unit of currency. For a long period, the United States government set the value of the US dollar so that one [troy ounce](/wiki/U.S._customary_units#Units_of_weight) was equal to $20.67 ($664.56/kg), but in 1934, the dollar was revalued to $35.00 per troy ounce ($1125.27/kg). By 1961 it was becoming hard to maintain this price, and a pool of US and European banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further currency devaluation against increased gold demand. On 17 March 1968, economic circumstances caused the collapse of the gold pool, and a two-tiered pricing scheme was established whereby gold was still used to settle international accounts at the old $35.00 per troy ounce ($1.13/g) but the price of gold on the private market was allowed to fluctuate; this two-tiered pricing system was abandoned in 1975 when the price of gold was left to find its free-market level. Central banks still hold historical [gold reserves](/wiki/index.php?title=Official_gold_reserves&action=edit&redlink=1) as a [store of value](/wiki/index.php?title=Store_of_value&action=edit&redlink=1) although the level has generally been declining. The largest gold depository in the world is that of the [U.S. Federal Reserve Bank](/wiki/index.php?title=U.S._Federal_Reserve_Bank&action=edit&redlink=1) in New York. On February 26, 2010, the price of gold as set in London was $1,112.50 per troy ounce. [[5]](#cite_note-5) Between December 1986 and then, the price of gold on the open market had varied widely, from a low of $253 per troy ounce in June 1999 [[6]](#cite_note-6) to the $1,112 per troy ounce of February 2010. Over 2005, the [World Gold Council](/wiki/index.php?title=World_Gold_Council&action=edit&redlink=1) estimated total global gold supply to be 3,859 tonnes and demand to be 3,754 tonnes, giving a surplus of 105 tonnes. [[7]](#cite_note-7) Restrictions on gold ownership Because of its use as a reserve asset, the possession of gold is sometimes restricted or banned. For example, within the United States, the private possession of gold except as jewelry or for coin collecting was banned between 1933 and 1975. President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt) expropriated gold by [Executive Order 6102](/wiki/index.php?title=Executive_Order_6102&action=edit&redlink=1), and President [Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon) closed the gold window by which foreign countries could exchange American dollars for gold at a fixed rate. Compounds Although gold is a [noble metal](/wiki/index.php?title=Noble_metal&action=edit&redlink=1), it can form many compounds, [gold(III) chloride](/wiki/index.php?title=Gold(III)_chloride&action=edit&redlink=1) (Au [Cl](/wiki/Chlorine)3) and chlorauric acid ( [H](/wiki/Hydrogen)AuCl4) being be (aurous, univalent, +1), gold(III) (auric, trivalent, +3). Gold also can under extreme conditions form a +5 and even a +7 state with [fluorine](/wiki/Fluorine) (gold pentafluoride, AuF5 and the extremely rare gold heptafluoride, AuF7), as well as a -1 state. Such compounds containing the Au- [anion](/wiki/Anion) are cluster compounds](/wiki/index.php?title=Gold_cluster_compound&action=edit&redlink=1) - Gold [hydrazide](/wiki/index.php?title=Hydrazine&action=edit&redlink=1): an olive-green powder, AuN2H3, one of several explosive compounds known archaically as aurum fulminans Isotopes There is one stable [isotope](/wiki/Isotope) of gold, and 18 [radioisotopes](/wiki/index.php?title=Radioisotope&action=edit&redlink=1), with 195Au being the most stable with a [half-life](/wiki/Half-life) of 186 days. Gold has been proposed as a \" [salting](/wiki/index.php?title=Salted_bomb&action=edit&redlink=1)\" material for [nuclear weapons](/wiki/Nuclear_weapon) ( [cobalt](/wiki/Cobalt) is another, better-known salting material). A jacket of natural gold, irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon, would transmute into the radioactive isotope Au-198 with a half-life of 2.697 days and produce approximately .411 [MeV](/wiki/index.php?title=MeV&action=edit&redlink=1) of [gamma radiation](/wiki/Gamma_ray), significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon's [fallout](/wiki/index.php?title=Nuclear_fallout&action=edit&redlink=1) for several days. Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used. Medicine The human body does not absorb gold very well, thus compounds of gold are not normally very toxic. [Liver](/wiki/Liver) and [kidney](/wiki/Kidney) damage has, however, been reported for up to 50% of arthritis patients treated with gold-containing drugs. Gold used in dentistry is widely regarded as the safest form of restorative material, as well as the most successful. As has recently been discovered, solutions containing special sugar-coated gold nano-particles can be used as [toxin](/wiki/index.php?title=Toxin&action=edit&redlink=1)- [indicators](/wiki/index.php?title=Indicator&action=edit&redlink=1). [[8]](#cite_note-8) Aurum metallicum (metallic gold) is also used as a [homeopathic](/wiki/Homeopathic) remedy, claimed to be helpful for people with a depressive nature. Symbolism Gold has been associated with the extremities of utmost evil and great sanctity throughout history. In the [Book of Exodus](/wiki/index.php?title=Exodus&action=edit&redlink=1), the [Golden Calf](/wiki/index.php?title=Golden_Calf&action=edit&redlink=1) is a symbol of [idolatry](/wiki/index.php?title=Idolatry&action=edit&redlink=1) and rebellion against God. In [Communist](/wiki/Communist) [propaganda](/wiki/Propaganda), the golden pocket watch and its fastening golden chain were the characteristic accessories of the class enemy, the bourgeoisie and the industrial [tycoons](/wiki/Tycoon). [Credit card](/wiki/index.php?title=Credit_card&action=edit&redlink=1) companies associate their product with wealth by naming and colouring their top-of-the-range cards \"gold;\" although, in an attempt to outdo each other, platinum (and the even-more-elite [black card](/wiki/index.php?title=Centurion_Card&action=edit&redlink=1)) has now overtaken gold. On the other hand, in the [Book of Genesis](/wiki/Genesis), [Abraham](/wiki/Abraham) was said to be rich in gold and [silver](/wiki/Silver). Eminent [orators](/wiki/index.php?title=Orator&action=edit&redlink=1) such as [John Chrysostom](/wiki/index.php?title=John_Chrysostom&action=edit&redlink=1) were said to have a \"mouth of gold with a silver tongue.\" Gold is associated with notable anniversaries, particularly in a 50-year cycle, such as a golden [wedding anniversary](/wiki/index.php?title=Wedding_anniversary&action=edit&redlink=1), [golden jubilee](/wiki/index.php?title=Golden_jubilee&action=edit&redlink=1), etc. Great human achievements are frequently rewarded with gold, in the form of medals and decorations. Winners of races and prizes are usually awarded the gold medal (such as the [Olympic Games](/wiki/Olympic_Games) and the [Nobel Prize](/wiki/Nobel_Prize)), while many award statues are depicted in gold (such as the [Academy Awards](/wiki/index.php?title=Academy_Awards&action=edit&redlink=1), the [Emmy Awards](/wiki/index.php?title=Emmy_Awards&action=edit&redlink=1), the [Palme d'Or](/wiki/index.php?title=Palme_d%27Or&action=edit&redlink=1), and the [British Academy Film Awards](/wiki/index.php?title=British_Academy_Film_Awards&action=edit&redlink=1)). Medieval kings were inaugurated under the signs of [sacred oil](/wiki/index.php?title=Anointing&action=edit&redlink=1) and a golden crown, the latter symbolizing the eternal shining light of heaven and thus a [Christian](/wiki/Christian) king's divinely inspired authority. Wedding rings are traditionally made of gold; since it is long-lasting and unaffected by the passage of time, it is considered a suitable material for everyday wear as well as a metaphor for the relationship. In [Orthodox Christianity](/wiki/Orthodox_Christianity), the wedded couple is adorned with a golden crown during the ceremony, an amalgamation of symbolic rites. The symbolic value of gold varies greatly around the world, even within geographic regions. For example, gold is quite common in [Turkey](/wiki/Turkey) but considered a most valuable gift in [Sicily](/wiki/Sicily). From most ancient times, gold has been connected to religion and spirituality, especially associated with the [Sun](/wiki/Sun). It was also seen as the best material to decorate religious imagery.
