Regional incidence decreased in all health authorities in the 10 -12 weeks prior to week 26, with the exception of Interior Health. In week 26 , the incidence rate in Interior Health increased slightly and remained the highe st at 11 per 100K. Age-specific i ncidences decreased from weeks 13 -14 to week 26 in all age groups with relative decreases ranging from 95% to 98%, except in the 20 -29 year -olds in which incidence stabilized in week 26 . Up to week 26 , single -dose vaccine cover age for 12+ year -olds reached 78 %; the highest coverage was in 70+ ye ar-olds at almost 90%, met by 14 cases in week 2 6. Testing of MSP -funded specimens decrease d by 76% from week 14 to week 26 . Positivity of MSP -funded specimens has also decreas ed since week 14 (12.1%), reachi ng 1.8 % in week 2 6. After a slight increase in week 25, there has been a decrease from 65 to 38 hospital admissions in week 26 and a decrease from 10 to 4 deaths, while intensive care admissions have been decreasing since week 15 (107 admissions), reach ing 9 admissions in week 26 . By case of earliest onset date, there were no new outbreaks repor ted in a care setting in week 26. BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 26 Page 2 of 10 BELOW ARE IMPORTANT NOTES relevant to the interpretation of data displayed in this bulletin: Episode date s are defined by dates of illness onset. When those dates are unavailable, earliest laboratory date is used (collection or result date); if also unavailable, then public health care report date is used . Analyses based on episode date (or illness onset date) may better represent the timing of epidemic evolution. Episode -based tallies for recent weeks are expected to increase as case data, in p articular onset dates, are more complete . The weekly tally by surveillance date (result date, if unavailable then report date) includes cases with illness onset date in preceding weeks. Episode dates for hospital admission, ICU, and death are defined by admission and death dates. When unavailable, surveillance date is used. As of June 15, 2021, per capita rates/incidences for year 2020 are based on Population Estimates 2020 (n= 5,139,568 for BC overall) and for year 2021 are based on PEOP LE 2020 estimates (n= 5,197,224 for BC overall). Laboratory data include Medical Service Plan (MSP) funded (e.g. clinical diagnostic tests) and non -MSP funded (e.g. screening tests) specimens. Data sources include: health authority case line list data, laboratory PLOVER data , PHSA Provincial Immunization Registry (PIR), and hospital data (PHSA Provincial COVID19 Monitoring Solution (PCMS)). Case data were extracted on July 11, 2021 , laboratory data on July 09, 2021 , PIR vaccine coverage date on July 09, 2021, and PCMS hospitalization data on July 12 , 2021 . A. COVID -19 case counts and epidemic curve s Provincially, up to week 2 6, 2021, there have been 147,835 cases for a cumulative incidence of 2,840 per 100K ( Table 1 , Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1 , following the peak of Wave 3 in week 14 at 150 per 100K, incidence has decreased by 96% to reach 5 per 100K in week 26. The incidence in week 26 is comparable to early A ugust 2020. Rates may increase as data by episode date become more complete. As shown in Figure 2 , incidence decreased in all health authorities in the 10 -12 weeks prior to week 26, except in Interior Health (IH) . In week 26, incidence in IH slightly increased, driven by increasing incidence in East Kooten ay and Thompson Cariboo Shuswap health service delivery area s, which increased from 5 to 22 per 100K and 4 to 5 per 100K from week s 25 to 26, respectively. Interior Health (IH) had the highest incidence rates at 11 per 100K followed by Fraser Health (FH) and Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) at 4 per 100K, Island Health (VIHA) at 1 per 100K and Northern Health (NH) at 0.3 per 100K. Rates may increase as data become more complet e. Table 1.

Likely sources of infection As shown in Table 2 and Figure 3 , domestic contact with a known case or cluster has been the most commonly reported source of infection across the pandemic to date . The proportion of cases likely exposed during international travel has increased since week 24 reaching 8% in week 26. Table 2.

Test rates and percent positive As shown by the darker -colored bars in Figure 4 , testing of MSP -funded specimens decreased by 76% from ~67,500 specimens in week 14 to ~16,000 in week 26. Positivity of MSP -funded specimens has been decreasing rapidly sinc e week 14 (12.1%) reaching 1.8% in week 26; this is comparable to positivity at the end of August 2020. As shown in Panel A of Figure 5 , the per capita testing rates for MSP -only specimens have been declining in all HAs since weeks 14-15. As shown in Panel B , percent positivity for MSP -funded tests has also been decreasing in all HAs since weeks 13 -14 to week 26 , with the exception of IH sl ightly increasing in week 26. For week 26, positivity was highest in IH at 3.7% followed by VCH, FH, and NHA at 1.5%, and lowest in VIHA at 0.5%. Figure 4.

Age profile - Testing and cases Testing rates and percent positivity by age group As shown by the bars in Figure 6 , testing rates in week 26 have decreased in all age groups since at least week 21, with the exception of the 80+ year -olds where there was a slight increase from week 24. The 80+ year -olds also had the highest testing rate by far for week 26 at 800 per 10 0K. As shown by the black dots in Figure 6 , the percent positivity has decreased in all age groups since week 21 , but has stabilized in 10 -14 year -olds and increased in 15-19 year -olds since week 23. After a steep decline in weeks 21 to 25, the percent positivity in the 15 -19-year -old age group increased from 2.4 to 4.2% in week 26. In week 26 , the percent posi tivity was highest in the 15 -19 years of age at 4.2%, followed by the 10 -14, 20 -39, 40 -59-year -olds which w ere comparable at ~2%, with the lowest in the 80+ year -olds at 0.8%. Case distribution and weekly incidence by age group As shown in Figure 7 , recent fluctuations in the proportion of affected age groups reflect small case counts, which are more pronounced starting week 22. Generally, younger adults between 20 and 49 years of age comprise half of the cases. As shown in Figure 8, age specific incidences decreased from weeks 13 -14 to week 26 in all age groups with relative decreases ranging from 95% to 98%, except in the 20 -29 year -olds in which incidence stabilized in week 26 . The highest incidences in week 26 were in the 20 -29-year -olds, 15 -19-year -olds and 30 -39-year -olds at 11, 7 and 6 per 100K, respectively and the lowest was in the <10 -year -olds at 1 per 100K. Week 26 age -specific incidences are likely to increase as data become more complete. Figure 6.

The vaccination of community - based older adults 70+ years of age started between weeks 10 and 14. As shown in Figure 9 , compared to the very steep increase in vaccination coverage from week 10 (11%) to week 16 (83%), rates have increased at a slower rate since week 17 reaching 89% in wee k 26 when there were only 14 cases reported for that age group. The vaccination of community -based (not residing in healthcare facilities, not healthcare workers and not clinically extremely vulnerable) adults 40 to 69 years of age started in weeks 15 -19; by week 26, coverage reached 85%, 80%, and 78% reflecting case counts of 18, 18, and 28 for the 60 -69, 50 -59, and 40 -49 year -olds, respectively. The vaccination of community -based adults 20 to 39 year of age started in weeks 19 -20; by week 26, coverage was 73% and 69% with 46 and 78 cases for the 30 -39 and 20 -29 year -old groups, respectively. The v accination of c hildren 12-19 years of age started in week 20; by week 26, coverage has steadily risen to 64% with 27 cases in this age group . Overall, single -dose vaccine coverage for all age groups 12+ years reached 78% by week 26, a 1% increase since wee k 25. Figure 9.

Severe outcome counts and epi -curve The number of weekly hospital admissions peaked in week 15 (384) and has declined by 90% since then, reaching 38 admissions in week 26, after a slight increase in week 25. ( Table 3 , Figure 9 ). Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions decreased by 91% since week 15 (107 admissions), reaching 9 admissions in week 26. The number of deaths decreased by 87% since week 19 (31 deat hs) with 4 deaths reported in week 26, after a slight increase in week 25. These numbers may increase in future reports as more data become available. Cumulatively, there have been 16 confirmed cases of Multi -system Inflammatory Syndrome in children and adolescents (MIS - C) in BC from January 1, 2020 to week 26 . No new cases were reported in week 26. The median age of these cases is 7 (range 1-15) years. Table 3.

Age profile, severe outcomes Table 4 displays the distribution of cases and severe outcomes. In week 26 , median age of hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths was 53 years, 60 years and 61 years, respectively , based on health authority case line lists only (data not shown). As shown in Figure 11 , since week 6, death counts have been low and stable in elderly adults with an average of 10 deaths per week in the 80+ year -olds, 6 in the 70 -79-year -olds, 4 in the 60 -69-year -olds, and 2 in the 50 -59-year -olds.
