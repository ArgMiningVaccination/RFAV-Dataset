These will be integrated with their electronic health records (including diagnostic tests, treatments, chronic conditions and image datasets), vaccination dates and records, post vaccination symptoms, antibody testing and covid -19 test results. Using deep learning methods we will develop models to predict early onset of infections and understand the long term effects of previous infection as well as effects of specific vaccines. Activity and Physiological Trackers To Detect And Monitor Pandemic Effects Need Wearable devices are increasingly used in the USA and globally to monitor individual health. Data collected from personal sensors can improve remote patient monitoring, enhance our pandemic response, and track secondary and long-term effects of COVID-19. Proposed Solution While there are existing studies that are currently conducting a subset of these analyses, our goal is to transform the prediction and monitoring of pandemic effects. We propose a comprehensive study that combines data from personal wearable sensors, COVID -19 tests and EHR datasets, antibody testing results, as well as COVID -19 vaccination records to not only proactively predict potential COVID -19 infection (or reinfections) but also long-term effects of COVID-19 and the effect of vaccines and other preventive measures.
