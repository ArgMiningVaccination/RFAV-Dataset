I'm going to discuss lessons learned, what has changed, and remaining huge challenges. Unfortunately, after the pandemic, our position in 2022 reminds me even more than ever of Aragorn at the Black Gate of Mordor, but that does not mean things are hopeless.

This is the most important lesson skepticism has to offer.

It's basically the same as the last strategic plan, but with one new addition. It's not really a new addition, but it signals a resurrection of an old trope about \"integrating\" quackery with science-based medicine.

Thankfully there weren't a lot of kids harmed, but when there is no potential benefit from an intervention, even one is way too many.
