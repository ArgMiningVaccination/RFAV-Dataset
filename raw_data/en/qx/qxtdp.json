All registered product are given a unique registration number starting with the word 'MAL' followed by an 8 digit no. and alphabet A, X, T or N (example : MAL12045467T). The classification of registered products is as follows: A - Controlled medicine (antibiotic, anti-diabetics) X - Over the counter (OTC) medicine (fever medicine, liniments) T - Traditional medicine (jamu, herbal pill) N - Health supplement (vitamin, minerals) Jamu and maajun are classified as traditional medicinal products and must be registered before they are sold to consumers. For a product to be classified as traditional medicine, they must contain only natural ingredients without addition of any modern or controlled medicine. Health Risk In general, the use of traditional medicine will require a longer duration before any effects or results are shown, as compared to controlled medicines. Analysis conducted on traditional products prior to registration only focuses to determine its quality and safety profiles. This differs from tests conducted on other category of registered products (i.e controlled medicines) which are evaluated based on their safety, quality and efficacy. Therefore consumers cannot expect to experience the same immediate results from traditional medicinal products as conventional controlled medicines. Nowadays, consumers are particularly interested and willing to consume health supplements or traditional products in order to enhance or improved their health status. However, some unscrupulous manufacturers are taking advantage of this growing trend and have adulterated their products with controlled or banned substances. This was done to mislead the public and gain consumer recognition that their products work miraculously and are as effective as its claims. This worrisome trend is mushrooming in tandem with the consumers booming desire to increase their health status. Consumer's preference to achieve faster results without fully understanding its consequences and effects on their health also contributes and acts like a magnet for this trend. Monitoring and market sampling conducted by the Pharmacy Enforcement Division, MOH have detected a number of traditional products including jamu and maajun which display fake holograms and/or registration numbers belonging to other registered products. Unsuspecting consumers might fall prey to these unethical activities and thus have false confidence that those products are registered and approved by MOH. Consumers might end-up buying medicines of unknown status which could be harmful/deleterious to health. Some of these unregistered products also display fake address to avoid detection thus making it difficult for enforcement officers to take action. Consumers are hereby encouraged to verify status of their product by checking the registration number on the product via Pharmaceutical Services Division's official website at www.pharmacy.gov.my. Information pertaining to all registered products are available online and can be verified for free. If the registration number or product's name are not found on the system or has different information (different manufacturer or address), it could be a fake and should be avoided at all cost.
