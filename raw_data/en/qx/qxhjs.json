When each cluster comprises persons in a localized geographic area, such as a county, cluster sampling is especially useful for national surveys. Dead space: Space occupied by the hub and the needle such that after the delivery of a full dose of a vaccine the liquid in these sections is wasted. Denominator: The number below the line in a ratio; divisor; population at risk. Intermediate vaccine store: A secondary store or substore that receives vaccine either from a primary vaccine store or anotherintermediate vaccine store and distributes vaccine to lower levels. Numerator: The number of parts being considered, where each part is an equal fraction of the whole; dividend. Primary vaccine store: A principal or main store that receives vaccine from the supplier. Proportional rate: The number of cases of a particular condition as a proportion of the total number of cases of all conditions. Random number: A number randomly selected. Random sampling: A method in which chance alone determines who will be included in the sample, removing any possibility of selection bias. Rate: A ratio that expresses the frequency of a characteristic per 100 (or per 1000, per million, etc.) persons in the population at a given time. Sample size: The optimum number of subjects to be recruited to answer the main objective(s) of the studyxiiSpecific rate: When the numerator and the denominator of a rate are confined to a specific category (e.g. males, children under 5, Asians, etc.) it is referred to as a specific rate; e.g. age-specific death rate, sex specific morbidity rate,etc. Systematic sampling: A type of random sampling where study units are arranged in some kind of sequence as in a directory or in a series of index cards, and a predetermined fractionof the population is selected as the study sample. Vaccine vial monitor: A label containing a heat-sensitive material which is placed on a vaccine vial to register cumulative heat exposure over time. The combined effects of time and temperature cause the inner square of the vaccine vialmonitor to darken gradually and irreversibly. A direct relationship exists between the rate of colour change and temperature: the lower the temperature, the slowerthe colour change; the higher the temperature, the faster the colour change.1 WHO/V&B/03.18The World Health Organization reports over 50% vaccine wastage around the world. Despite the availability of many tools for reducing such wastage, high wastage ratesare still occurring in countries. Because of increasing EPI vaccine costs during the last two years, tightening vaccine security and the introduction of new and underused vaccines through the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI),countries are looking more closely than before at vaccine wastage. Moreover, GAVI has requested countries to bring down vaccine wastage rates: \"The country would aim for a maximum wastage rate of 25% set for the first year with a plan togradually reduce it to 15% by the third year. For vaccine in single-dose or two-dose vials the maximum wastage allowance is 5%. No maximum limits have been set for yellow fever vaccine in multidose vials.\" 1 This document reviews the factors affecting vaccine wastage and discusses the tools available for reducing wastage and their relationships to each other, with the aim of providing assistance to programme managers to establish a system for monitoringvaccine wastage as a programme quality indicator. Vaccine wastage can be expected in all programmes. The questions arise as to whether any of the wastage is preventable and, if so, how to prevent it. Wastage in unopenedvials is usually attributable to cold chain and stock management problems and can be minimized. Wastage in opened vials cannot be eliminated, but can be reduced by the introduction of the multidose vial policy (MDVP), the effective use of vaccine vialmonitors (VVMs), and improved immunization strategies and practices. Vaccine wastage is an important factor in calculating vaccine needs. If incorrect figures are used the country concerned may face serious vaccine shortages or be unable to consume received quantities, leading to increased wastage through expiry. It is thereforecrucial that all immunization points using vaccines and that the stores handling them monitor their use continuously. Such monitoring can provide programme managers with good guidance on the introduction of corrective actions to reduce wastagewhenever necessary.1. Introduction 1GAVI inception report.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 2Since wastage is defined as loss by use, decay, erosion or leakage or through wastefulness,2 it is wise to begin a discussion of wastage by considering vaccine usage. Usage is firmly established and generally acceptable practice or procedure. Since vaccines are designed to be administered to prevent certain diseases, vaccine usage can be defined as the proportion of vaccine issued which is administered, i.e.3 Vaccine wastage is the opposite of vaccine usage and is given by: Vaccine wastage rate = 100 - vaccine usage rate. 2.1 Types of vaccine wastage One way of classifying vaccine wastage is to distinguish the reasons for it as either system-related or programme-related. However, this is confusing since some wastagein unopened vials cannot be considered as system wastage. For example, vials taken for an outreach session, even if not used, do not usually return to the cold chain if VVMs are not attached. This wastage occurs because of programme implications butinvolves unopened vials.2. What is vaccine wastage and how is it calculated? 2Webster's New Encyclopedic Dictionary, BD & L, New York, 1993. 3The \"time\" aspect of formulas in this document is not indicated so that each can be presented inone line. It should be kept in mind that the phrase \"in a given period\" (month, year or supplyperiod) should be attached to each formula. 4Number of doses issued includes doses used for immunization and all doses discarded or lost forany reason (including expiry, VVM indication, cold chain failure, freezing, missing inventory orroutine discard of open vials of vaccine at the end of a session).Number of doses administered Vaccine usage (rate) = x 100 Number of doses issued43 WHO/V&B/03.18Fig. 1. In many national immunization programmes, unopened vials taken for outreach, if not used, do not return to refrigerators if VVMs are not attached In this manual, vaccine wastage is classified as occurring \"in unopened vials\" and \"in opened vials\". Expiry, VVM indication, heat exposure, freezing, breakage, missing inventory and theft are the forms of vaccine wastage affecting unopened vials. This type of wastage occurs at all levels of an immunization system (in all storagefacilities, during delivery/transportation and at service level). Vaccine wastage in opened vials may also occur because doses remaining in an opened vial at the end of a session are discarded, the number of doses drawn from a vial is not the same as that indicatedon the label, reconstitution practices are poor, opened vials are submerged in water, and contamination is suspected. The reaction of a baby to immunization may also cause the dose administered to be wasted, especially in the case of oral vaccines. In thiscircumstance, more than one dose is required to immunize a child. Table 1. Types of vaccine wastage Vaccine wastage in unopened vials Vaccine wastage in opened vials Expiry In addition to the types listed in the previous column: VVM indication Discarding remaining doses at end of session Heat exposure Not being able to draw the number of doses indicated Freezing on the label of a vial Breakage Poor reconstitution practices Missing inventory Submergence of opened vials in water Theft Suspected contamination Discarding unused vials returned from an outreach Patient reaction requiring more than one dose sessionField guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage vials, frozen vials or vials with VVMs beyond the discard point should not be kept in a cold store, refrigerator or freezer, as they may be confused with those containing vaccine of good quality.5 If unusable vaccines have to be kept for a period before disposal, e.g. until accounting or auditing procedures have beencompleted, they should be kept outside the cold chain, separated from all usable stocks and clearly labelled \" Damaged/expired vaccine - do not use \" in order to avoid mistaken use. Similarly, only vaccine stocks that are fit for use should be included in stock records. Damaged or expired vaccines should not appear in available stock balances. If such vaccines have to be kept until accounting or auditing procedures have been completed,details should be recorded on a separate page or card pending disposal. Since damaged vaccine cannot be used the stock records should be adjusted and the loss should be recorded on a Loss and adjustment report (Annex 1). Once disposal has been authorized, damaged items should be disposed of safely by incineration or other nationally approved means. Vaccination points may be required to return all damaged vaccine vials. 2.2 Vaccine wastage calculations in vaccine stores Because vaccine stores handle only unopened vials the above formula cannot be applied to primary and intermediate vaccine stores. For years, an erroneous practice was used to calculate vaccine wastage rates by simply using primary store figures and the numberof children immunized nationwide. 5For detailed information on recording losses, refer to WHO-UNICEF Effective Vaccine Store Management initiative - Module 2: Model quality plan. Geneva: World Health Organization;2004 (unpublished document WHO/IVB/04.18).WARNING This formula should NOT be used for calculation of national vaccine wastage rate The use of this formula to calculate vaccine wastage rates from primary store figures is quite erroneous and cannot reflect the true situation because all vaccines distributed from the primary store are considered as used in the field, which is never the case. Thiscalculation can only work in situations where vaccine distribution is well designed and flows very smoothly without any deviation from what has been planned. This also implies smooth vaccination operations at field level without any interruptions.One recent exercise carried out by a group of countries in Africa showed NEGATIVE vaccine wastage rates in some countries, mainly because of interrupted deliveries and the introduction of pulse campaigns for catching up: in the field, existing stocks wereused and more children were immunized than would have been possible with newNumber of children immunized nationwideVaccine usage (rate) = x 100 Number of doses issued from the primary store5 WHO/V&B/03.18deliveries received during the calculation period. This calculation can also be very misleading if used for a newly introduced vaccine since in such circumstances there is a zero start balance in the field. Moreover, the calculation of vaccine wastage annually on a national basis is a \"postmortem\" exercise and is too late for corrective measures to be taken. In addition, this calculation cannot provide any information on types of wastage, such as would be required for the planning of corrective measures. The problems associated with the denominator of the above formula can be explained visually (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. Problems associated with using number of doses issued from primary vaccine store in nationwide vaccine wastage calculation In Fig. 2 the lightly shaded boxes are included in the national calculation, the white box (start balance in the field) is ignored, and the darkly shaded boxes represent wasteddoses. If each unit represents 1000 doses the use of primary vaccine store figures gives vaccine wastage as 37%, whereas it is really 29%. 6 In cases where a higher start balance is available, especially in regional/district calculations, negative vaccine wastage rates can be calculated from vaccine store figures. One argument that could be brought against this is that the start balance neutralizes the effect of the end balance in the field. Thisargument is valid only if they are equal, a very unlikely situation. Furthermore, this calculation is more erroneous for vaccine wastage calculations for the first year in respect of vaccines newly introduced into an immunization programme. 6No details are given here of the calcuation of the 29% wastage rate. The reason for the discrepancy is made clear in Annex 2.5000 doses wastedPrimary vaccine for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 6However, this does not mean that nothing should be monitored at the primary level and in intermediate vaccine stores. The best vaccine wastage indicator for vaccine stores is the proportional vaccine wastage in unopened vials. This can easily be calculated as follows. The number of doses discarded includes all discards of unopened vials because of expiry, VVM indication, heat exposure, breakage, freezing, missing inventory and theft. This rate, which is specific for vaccine stores, should not be used for comparison with the vaccine wastage rate explained above. It gives the management performancelevels of vaccine stores, since these only handle unopened vaccine vials. Because this category of wastage can be minimized the question arises as to what is the acceptable level for such failures. Vaccines delivered during the calculation period should not be subtracted from the denominator because, if any quantities of vaccine are damaged during transportation, this wastage is recorded in the sender's vaccine store account. 2.3 Vaccine wastage calculations at service level All immunization points monitor their coverage rates on a monthly basis.Similarly, vaccine usage and wastage should be monitored monthly at all service points.This has to be a self-audit and should be used as a managerial tool as well as for producing new forms and/or tables to submit to higher levels. The formula given at the beginning of this section can be detailed as follows.Number of doses discarded Start balance + number of doses receivedProportional vaccine wastage x 100 rate in unopened vials = Number of doses administered Vaccine usage (rate) = x 100 Number of doses issued It is always recommended that calculations are based on numbers of doses rather than on numbers of vials. If numbers of vials are used the calculations are complicated because of variation in the number of doses in a vial.Number of doses administered Vaccine usage (rate) = x 100 Number of doses received during periodNumber of usable doses at beginning of periodNumber of usable doses in stock at end of period+- 7 WHO/V&B/03.18Example Yenice Health Centre received 2000 doses of DTP vaccine in 20-dose vials in January. Monthly reporting indicated that 1300 children were immunized. There was a start balance of 300 doses on 1 January and by 31 January the stock level was 600 doses. Fig. 3. Calculation of vaccine wastage by 31 January Wasted amount: 400 dosesStart balance: 300 doses 2000 doses received during January On the basis of the above formulas: The vaccine wastage rate can also be calculated without going through vaccine usage, as follows. Number of doses wasted Number of doses suppliedVaccine wastage (rate) = x 100 In detail this formula is:Vaccine wastage rate = 100 - 76 = 24%.1300Vaccine usage rate = x 100 = 76% 300 + 2000 - 600 Number of usable doses at beginning of period Vaccine wastage (rate) = X 100Number of doses received during periodNumber of usable doses in stock at end of periodNumber of doses administered Number of usable doses at beginning of periodNumber of doses received during periodNumber of usable doses in stock at end of period +-- +-Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 8Using the above figures in this formula: 300 + 2000 - 600 - 1300 300 + 2000 - 600Vaccine wastage rate = x 100 = 24% In these calculations the vaccine wastage rate includes wastage in both unopened and opened vials. Since discards and losses of unopened vials should always be recorded, a detailed analysis of vaccine wastage is also possible at all service levels. Details ofvaccine wastage give programme managers an improved understanding of problems, which can then be addressed. The vital matter is that of reducing vaccine wastage. In order to make a plan for inclusion in the inception reports,as required by GAVI, the sources of wastage have to be revealed. If the reasons for wastage are unknown, plans are bound to be unrealistic and may have a negative impact on immunization coverage. Details of advanced calculation of vaccine wastage rates are given in Annex 2. 2.4 Wastage factor In vaccine forecasting the vaccine wastage factor is used rather than the rate. The vaccine wastage factor indicates how much additional vaccine should be ordered in order to allow for the given wastage rate. 100Vaccine wastage factor = Vaccine usage rate100Vaccine wastage factor = 100 - Vaccine wastage rate 100 - 29 71Vaccine wastage factor = = = 1.4100 100Since [100 - vaccine wastage rate] equals the vaccine usage rate, the formula can also be written as: For the above example: This means that 1.4 times more vaccine should be ordered so as to cover the estimated 29% vaccine wastage. Vaccine wastage must be calculated at all levels on a routine and regular basis. Although direct calculation is possible it is always recommended that usage rates be used as a start point in calculating wastage.7 7See Annex 2 for other ways of calculating the vaccine wastage factor.9 WHO/V&B/03.18It is not possible to advocate a universally acceptable vaccine wastage level. Acceptable wastage levels vary between programmes in the light of experience and the analysis oflocal situations. For example, remote services have to open more vials per child than urban services, and as a result higher wastage rates are expected in rural areas. Similarly, in locations where a great majority of the population can only be reached through outreach services, higher wastage rates are expected. A study of DTP and HepB vaccine wastage was conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic in 2001. 8 Villages were grouped according to their distance from a fixed immunization site. Wastage rates were lower in villages that immunization teams could reach on foot or by bicycle or canoe and from which they could return to base the same day than in locations where the teams had to stay overnight. In the Lao People's DemocraticRepublic, around 38% of the population live in remote areas, corresponding to 53% of villages. It was concluded that higher immunization coverage could only be achieved if higher wastage rates were accepted. Vaccine wastage rates are not usually plotted against immunization coverage rates. They are evaluated in isolation, making it impossible to see whether they should be considered high, low or reasonable. For example, a DTP wastage rate of 40% may beconsidered high in a country with 50% immunization coverage but acceptable in a country where more than half the population can only be reached through outreach activities. It is also important to know the type of vaccine wastage. A high wastage rate attributable to opening a multidose vial for a small session size in order to avoid missed opportunities is more acceptable than wastage attributable to freezing or expiry. However, it should be noted that higher vaccine wastage is expected with freeze-dried vaccines since theymust be discarded within six hours of opening, whereas liquid vaccines can be used in subsequent sessions for up to 4 weeks. The relationship between vaccine wastage rate and immunization coverage is the key to deciding whether wastage is really high. Both should be analysed over a period of time rather than at a given point in time in order to reveal trends. Figs. 4-9 indicate possible reasons for different trends in vaccine wastage and immunizationcoverage rates.3. What is an acceptable wastage level? 8Richard Duncan, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization support to introduce hepatitis Bvaccine, Lao People's Democratic Republic, 26 February to 11 May 2002, MR/2002/0066,WHO WPRO.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 10If immunization coverage and vaccine wastage rates follow the same trend (with little fluctuation) in a given period it is essential to know the reasons for the trend in order to understand whether wastage can be reduced (Fig. 4). Reports of the same vaccine wastage without any change in immunization coverage often indicatethat wastage is not really understood or analysed but is just repeated over the years. Such situations should be carefully analysed. Fig. 4. Relationship between vaccine wastage and immunization coverage Vaccine wastageImmunization coverage TimePercent If vaccine wastage increases at a certain point over a period of time while the immunization coverage rate remains the same, potential causes such as expiry or cold chain failure during storage and transportation should be investigated (Fig. 5). Althoughmost wastage can be expected in unopened vials, discards may involve both opened and unopened vials. The fact that immunization coverage remains level indicates that, despite increased wastage, the programme has had enough vaccines to replace theselosses. This may also indicate a need to review the vaccine forecast so as to determine if more vaccine than necessary was ordered and received. Fig. 5. Relationship between vaccine wastage and immunization coverage Immunization coverage Vaccine wastage TimePercent11 WHO/V&B/03.18If vaccine coverage remains the same while wastage decreases (Fig. 6), programme managers should investigate the validity of the data and the reasons for the fall in the wastage rate. If an improvement in the effectiveness of vaccine management is responsible, this should be documented and attention should then be concentrated onimproving coverage rates. Fig. 6. Relationship between vaccine wastage and immunization coverage If the immunization coverage rate decreases while the vaccine wastage rate increases (Fig. 7), vaccine damage in unopened vials is indicated, resulting in losses where the system cannot replace the vaccine. Consequently, planned immunizations cannot beachieved. The problem is most likely to be at the storage level and/or during vaccinetransportation. Depending on the type of vaccine, freezing or heat exposure of a bulk quantity may be responsible. The first step in analysing the data should be to rule out expiry discards. Fig. 7. Relationship between vaccine wastage and immunization coverageVaccine wastageImmunization coverage TimePercent Vaccine wastageImmunization coverage TimePercentField guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 12Fig. 8 illustrates a very typical instance of increased outreach activities resulting in increased immunization coverage and vaccine wastage. Although high vaccine wastage rates are expected in increased outreach activities, the following questions have to be answered in order to determine possible means of keeping vaccine wastage as small aspossible: Is the multidose vial policy practised for liquid vaccines? Do health workers take more unopened vials (without VVMs) than they need and discard them if unused on returning to the health centre? How well are populations informed about outreach activities (would larger sessions sizes be possible)? Fig. 8. Relationship between vaccine wastage and immunization coverage Vaccine wastageImmunization coverage TimePercent If both rates are decreasing the most likely reason is that the number of immunization sessions has been reduced, resulting in refusals to immunize children attending on non-session days and in missed opportunities (Fig. 9). Reducing the number of outreachactivities may have the same effect. No matter what the reasons, the situation must be studied in detail in order to understand whether the approach to reducing vaccine wastage causes a similar decrease in immunization coverage. A successful initiative toreduce vaccine wastage should not result in a reduction in immunization coverage.13 WHO/V&B/03.18Fig. 9. Relationship between vaccine wastage and immunization coverage Vaccine wastageImmunization coverage TimePercent In reality these situations may not appear as isolated cases. More often a combination of many factors is involved. Any unusual relationship between immunization coverage and vaccine wastage should be analysed. As mentioned earlier, vaccine wastage in unopened vials is unacceptable and should be minimized. The WHO-UNICEF Effective Vaccine Store Management (EVSM) initiative on improving vaccine management practices in primary and intermediatevaccine stores involves the calculation of proportional vaccine wastage in unopened vials in vaccine storage facilities and considers 1% wastage to be acceptable. 9 Among the reasons for wastage in unopened vials, only accidental breakage and missing inventories are considered unavoidable. Bad management is a primary cause of unopened vials being discarded because of expiry and heat exposure and freezing in the cold chain. It is essential to minimize these factors. Expiry is only acceptable in emergency operations where vaccines are positioned in certain locations because of the possibility, for example, of war spreading to a particular region and displacing people. Although such circumstances are regularly reviewed the amount of vaccine being kept in case the possibility turns intoreality may eventually prove to be more than the programme in question can absorb. Such operations should work out mechanisms for rotating vaccines so as to keep maximum shelf-life available in conflict situations. The relationships between immunization coverage and vaccine wastage are summarized in Table 2. 9WHO-UNICEF Effective Vaccine Store Management initiative - Module 2: Model quality plan. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2004 (unpublished document WHO/IVB/04.18).Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 14Table 2. Problematic time trend relationships between immunization coverage and vaccine wastage Immunization Vaccine Where to focus coverage wastage Same Same Types of vaccine wastage should be analysed in order to determine whether new tools could be introduced to reduce wastage. Same Increasing Focus on the storage and transportation of vaccines, because increasing wastage while coverage remains the same indicateswastage in unopened vials. If the increase is too high, vaccine forecasts should be reviewed so as to understand whether too much vaccine is being ordered. Same Decreasing Validation of the data is the first step. Since wastage is decreasing, special attention should be given to determining how to increase immunization coverage. Decreasing Increasing Vaccine damage occurs in unopened vials. Consequently, losses occur where the system cannot replace the vaccines and thereforeplanned immunizations cannot be achieved. The problem is likely tobe found at the storage level and/or during vaccine transportation(either freezing or heat damage). The first step in analysing the data should be to rule out expiry discards. Decreasing Decreasing The possibility has to be considered that measures used to reduce wastage contribute to decreased immunization coverage. Likelyreasons are a reduced number of immunization sessions and arefusal to give immunization where this would require multidose vials to be opened, in order to prevent high wastage. Increasing Increasing This circumstance may arise because of increased outreach activity. The implementation of the multidose vial policy (MDVP), effectiveVVM use and the organization of sessions during outreach activitiesshould be examined in order to determine whether vaccine wastage can be reduced.15 WHO/V&B/03.184.1 Monitoring vaccine wastage in health care facilities As discussed in Chapter 3, all immunization points should monitor their vaccine wastage rates as they monitor their immunization coverage. However, compiling such information for an entire country may not be considered manageable.This depends on whether the flow of information in the country concerned is satisfactory. One option is to use representative sentinel reporting sites. The procedure for defining such sites is described in Annex 3. 4.2 Sample forms for reporting from sentinel sites Sentinel sites should report directly to the director of the national immunizationprogramme or to a unit designated to compile the reports. Reporting should take place monthly throughout the year. The national immunization programme may request additional information to be included in the reports. However, data shouldnot be requested if they are not going to be processed and used. Table 3 provides a generic sample data reporting form for monitoring vaccine wastage.4.

The contents of Table 3 should be considered as the minimumrequired. 11For vaccines given in more than 1 dose (i.e.. DTP in 3 doses), vaccine wastage calculations areaffected by wastage occurring in all doses whereas the coverage rate (DTP1, DTP2 and DTP3)will only reflect the completed immunization rate (DTP3). Ideally, in these situations, vaccinewastage should be analysed against the immunization performance rate, calculated as the sum of[(children immunized with DTP1 + DTP2 + DTP3)*100/(target group for DTP1 + DTP2 +DTP3)]. For practical reasons the target group can also be multiplied by the number of doses givenfor a particular vaccine. In the case of DTP, column E includes all children who receive the first,second and third doses of DTP . In coverage calculations, therefore, the target group should bemultiplied by 3.17 WHO/V&B/03.184.3 Monitoring vaccine wastage in vaccine storage facilities Vaccine storage facilities should be included in the regular monitoring of vaccine wastage. All vaccine storage facilities in selected regions of a country should be includedin addition to 10 health care facilities selected by the above mentioned methodology. If there are more than 10 vaccine storage facilities in a selected region, random or systematic sampling should be used to identify 10 sentinel vaccine storage facilities forroutine reporting. Table 4 provides a generic sample data reporting form for monitoring vaccine wastage in vaccine storage facilities.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 18Table 4.

Vaccine wastage ratescalculated from vaccine store records and health centres cannot be combined since they measure and mean different things (note that the denominators of the two formulas are not the same). This manual does not explain how to estimate vaccine needs bymeans of different formulas. The most direct and most commonly used formula is given as an example below. Both vaccine wastage rates must be included as translated into a wastage factor in the formula. Target population x number of doses required x target coverage x wastage factor For example, if the proportional vaccine wastage rate from vaccine stores is calculated to be 5% and the vaccine wastage rate from sentinel points is 23%, the first requirementis for these to be converted into wastage factors.5. Incorporating vaccine wastage rates in estimates of vaccine needs Wastage factor of proportional vaccine wastage rate in unopened vials calculated from storesWastage factor of vaccine wastage rate calculated from sentinel points x 100 100 Wastage factor for proportional vaccine wastage rate = = = 1.05 100 - 5 95 100 100Wastage factor for vaccine wastage rate = = = 1.29 100 - 23 77 In this case the wastage factor to be included in the formula is: 1.05 x 1.29 = 1.35Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 20The wastage rates cannot be merged. If they were, the total wastage rate would be 5% + 23% = 28%, giving a wastage factor of 1.39, whereas the above formula only gives a wastage factor of 1.35. Some readers may consider this difference to be small, as for HepB vaccine the difference for a 500 000 birth cohort would only be 48 000 doses,translating into US$ 24 000 if the vaccine were in a 10-dose presentation.21 WHO/V&B/03.18Many factors contribute to vaccine wastage, ranging from the vaccine to the vaccinator. They are not independent of each other. The presence of one factor may trigger theappearance of another. Factors affecting vaccine wastage can be categorized in different ways. No matter how they are categorized, wastage in unopened vials is avoidable and should be treated asunacceptable. Vaccine wastage is believed to be higher at the service level than elsewhere. In many countries, however, vaccine wastage in unopened vials is quite high in vaccine stores.One reason is that vaccine stores keep large quantities of vaccines, and if something goes wrong the whole amount is at risk of being damaged and therefore discarded. It is important that cold stores track wastage within their terms as explained in section2.2. 6.1 Factors related to vaccines and syringes Vial size More wastage is reported with the larger vial sizes unless they are used in mass immunization activities. Different vial sizes allow immunization managers to choose the best presentation for the purposes of specific programmes. Smaller vials cost more than larger ones containing the same vaccine, resulting in a higher cost per immunizedchild. Moreover, smaller vials require greater cold chain and vaccine transportation capacity than larger ones.6. Factors affecting vaccine wastageField guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 22Fears of meningitis vaccine wastage By Alan MacDermid, Herald News, 22 September 1999 Health chiefs have mounted a search for small-scale stocks of meningitis vaccine after fears that some of the supply being gathered for Scottish students could end updown the sink. A large proportion of the meningitis C vaccine intended to protect the 85 000 students enrolling in universities and colleges comes in 50-unit vials. There is not yet enough of the new conjugate vaccine, which protects indefinitely, to go round all those eligible, and the existing vaccine is being offered to students as astopgap. It protects for only 5 to 10 years and is normally used to immunize large numbers where an outbreak has already been identified. Dr Harry Burns, Director of Public Health for Greater Glasgow Health Board, said, \"If you are a GP with a 50-dose vial and you have only three students to vaccinate,there is the potential for a lot of waste\". A Scottish Executive spokesman said, \"The vaccine is made in smaller quantities than 50 and we are trying to source these. All the evidence is that we will have 90 000 units available by November, which will be enough to cope\". Dead space in syringes All syringes have a dead space and WHO defines the maximum allowable dead space for different types of syringes. For the 0.5-ml auto-disable (AD) syringe the maximumallowable dead space is 50 microlitres. 12 In the case of 0.05-ml AD syringe, the maximum allowable dead space is 25 microlitres.13 Vaccine manufacturers are expected to overfill vials so as to compensate for vaccine wastage attributable to dead space in syringes andtherefore to ensure that the number of doses indicated on the label can be drawn from the vial. 120.5-ml auto-disable syringe, product specification E8/DS1, 1 October + freeze-dried Hib from GSK is overfilled by 0.3 ml to compensate for the following losses14: loss in DTPw-HepB vial (remaining liquid) : 0.05 ml up to 0.1 ml; loss in needle lumen to reconstitute Hib : +/- 0.05 ml; loss in vial with reconstituted Hib (remaining liquid) : +/- 0.05 ml; loss in lumen of needle for injection : +/- 0.05 ml; loss during de-airing of syringe before injection : +/- 0.05 ml. Failure to use syringes of assured quality meeting WHO standards may increase wastage if the syringes have a larger dead space. 6.2 Factors related to national policy Procurement practices Poor vaccine forecasting may result in increased vaccine wastage. Countries may receive more vaccines than are needed annually, leading to the expiry of vaccines before they can be used. Another possibility is that countries may receive correct quantities overallbut have insufficient cold chain capacity to accommodate deliveries, with the result that vaccines are at risk of exposure to adverse temperatures. The choice of a wrong vial size for procurement may also contribute to increased vaccine wastage if there is not enough cold chain capacity. Coordination of donor efforts Countries may appeal to several donors with the same request or some donors may have special interest in some countries and particular programmes. If these efforts are not coordinated, countries may end up receiving more vaccines than their programmescan use or maintain in the cold chain. Vaccine vial monitor (VVM) introduction VVMs were first used with OPV during 1996. They have now been delivered withmore than 1.5 billion doses of OPV to more than 80 countries. Starting in 2001, VVMswere included as product specifications through tenders by UNICEF for all other EPI vaccines. GAVI also requires the use of VVMs with vaccines. VVMs cannot be properly used if health workers are not trained in good time.A failure to identify health workers who need refresher training on VVM use may also result in the incorrect use of VVMs and some increase in vaccine wastage. VVM in tender requirements If countries procure their own vaccines and do not include VVMs as a tender requirement, immunization programmes cannot benefit from this wastage reduction tool. It is now routine practice to discard vaccines without VVMs if exposure to heat caused by cold chain failures has occurred. 14Personal communication, Paul Tollet, GSK.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 24Discarding of doses remaining in opened vials at end of day Countries that have not adopted MDVP have greater wastage rates for liquid vaccines. However, where sterilizable syringes are used or other sources of contamination of opened vials are not under control, countries may have difficulties in adopting MDVP nationwide. 6.3 Factors related to logistics Stock control Good stock control practices require vital information on vaccines to be recorded when they are received, during storage and when they are leaving the store for distribution. If expiry dates are not recorded and followed up properly, storekeepers may dispatch a batch that expires later than the ones kept at the store. This is callednon-compliance with the earliest-expiry-first-out (EEFO) principle. 15 When vaccines are received at the store, the status of time-temperature indicators such as VVMs should be checked and recorded. During storage the storage temperatures should be monitoredand any changes in time-temperature indicators should be recorded. The only exception to the EEFO principle involves the earlier release of vaccine vials with VVMs showing more heat exposure (approaching the discard point) than vaccinevials with earlier expiry dates but with VVMs showing less heat exposure. Alternative cold chain An alternative cold chain, especially at national level, may be of value in countrieshaving excess vaccine for whatever reason. In the case of non-availability a push-down distribution approach mostly results in vaccines from the primary vaccine store being sent to the intermediate stores and therefore to immunization points without a check being made as to whether the cold chain capacity can really absorb them. Thisputs the vaccines at risk of expiry or of being exposed to improper temperatures because of a lack of adequate storage capacity. Alternative cold chain capacity is also of value in emergency situations, e.g. the flooding of stores. An assessment conducted in an African country in March 2002 revealed the presence of a 57-month worth stock of DTP and a 59-month worth stock of measles vaccine (expiring in June 2002) in one health facility. Quality and management of cold chain Cold chain equipment that is not compatible with WHO-UNICEF product information sheets (PIS) cannot ensure the storage temperatures required for different types of vaccines. Moreover, if not well maintained, PIS-compatible equipment may malfunction and may put vaccines at risk of exposure to unacceptable temperatures. 15EEFO handling is safer than first-in-first-out (FIFO) handling. In general when two batches of vaccine are delivered at different times, the one arriving second will have a later expiry date.However, this is not always the case, particularly when vaccines are obtained from differentsources.25 WHO/V&B/03.18Ice-lined refrigerators provide a good example of this problem. Longer hold-over times in an ice-lined refrigerator than in other models are possible because the inside of the cabinet is lined with water-filled tubes or ice packs. This water stays frozen as long as electricity is available. When the supply fails, the ice gradually melts and keepsthe cabinet cool. However, when the electricity supply is restored, the compressor has to operate extensively in order to freeze the water lining again within a limited number of hours, and, occasionally, the temperature in the vaccinestorage area at the base of the appliance falls below 0\u00b0C. Freeze-sensitive vaccines should NOT, therefore, be stored within 20 cm of the base of these models. Some models have a mark inside the cabinet which indicates areas potentially dangerous forthe storage of such vaccines. Similarly, if not managed well, freeze-sensitive vaccines may become frozen in cold rooms at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. In these cold rooms the evaporator coil temperature is around-5\u00b0C and the temperature of the outlet air may be below 0\u00b0C. As a result there is a risk that freeze-sensitive vaccines will be destroyed if they are stored too close to the evaporator outlet. Temperature monitoring If the temperature in cold chain equipment for storing vaccines is not monitored and controlled regularly, vaccines may be at risk of exposure to unacceptable temperatures, resulting in wastage. Experience shows that the national cold store is the most criticalelement of an immunization system because this is where vaccines are received, stored and distributed in bulk. When there is an equipment or management failure at the primary level, large quantities of vaccine may be destroyed in a matter of a few hours.The immunization services of an entire country may thus be placed at risk and thefinancial loss can reach millions of dollars. Vaccine distribution and transportation practices If correct practices are not followed during transportation, vaccines may be damagedby exposure to excessive heat or to freezing temperatures. When this happens there isincreased vaccine wastage and supplies may become inadequate. Not observing the EEFO principle during deliveries may also result in locations receiving vaccines with a short shelf-life which cannot be consumed in the time available. If a programme does not allow a two-way distribution system 16 whenever necessary, excess vaccines at lower levels will be left to be either expired or damaged and therefore discarded. 16A two-way distribution system allows excess unopened vials of vaccine to be sent back up the chain for redistribution. Such a system can only be used if managers are confident that excessvaccine at lower levels is kept under recommended storage conditions. In this regard, using andrecording the status of time-temperature indicators in stock records is vital.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 26Reading and/or using VVM status If storekeepers do not know how to read and interpret VVMs and make informed choices in distribution they may put vaccines at risk. For example, if vaccine vials with VVMs showing comparatively low heat exposure are sent out before vaccine vials with VVMs approaching the discard point, the vaccines kept in store will be at risk ofreaching their discard point during storage. Also, if health workers do not pay attention to VVMs or do not know how to read them, they may unnecessarily discard unopened vials after an outreach session or cold chain failure rather than using the VVMs inorder to determine which vials to keep. Communication and supervision In cases where global policies to reduce vaccine wastage are adopted at national level,good communication down to service level and effective supervision are needed toensure that the policies are translated into local action. A lack of effective communication and supervision causes policies to remain on paper only. 6.4 Factors related to immunization practice17 Liquid vaccines discarded at end of session (or before four weeks) If multidose vials of liquid vaccine presentations are not kept for subsequent sessions (up to four weeks) and are thrown away at the end of a session, vaccine wastage ratesare reported to be high. Reconstitution practices If the whole content of diluent is not used to reconstitute powder vaccine,fewer doses are available in the vaccine vial for vaccination. Moreover,vaccines reconstituted with the wrong volume of diluent are likely to cause adverse events following immunization. 18 Cold chain failures Cold chain failures may expose vaccines to high temperatures if storekeepers and/or health workers do not know what to do in such cases. 17Vaccine requirements are calculated on the basis of target age groups. The use of a vaccine outside the target group is considered to represent wastage. All programmes are required to report childrenimmunized in the target groups. In theory, children immunized outside target age groups shouldnot be included in this reporting. The wastage attributable to this factor is not discussed further inthis manual. 18Vaccine and Biologicals Update: Vaccine reconstitution, WHO, Vol. 34, December 2000.27 WHO/V&B/03.18Session size Small session size increases wastage if larger dose presentations are used. However, the opening of a new vial, even for one child, in order to avoid a missed opportunity, is always a promoted practice and should not be considered undesirable.19 The golden rule should be to avoid compromising vaccination coverage. However, the way in which the problem of small session size is tackled can differ between outreach activities and fixed-site immunization points. Injection practices (contamination) Poor injection practices may cause contamination of vaccine vials. If a health worker suspects contamination he or she should not use the vial in question and should discard it. This results in increased wastage. If opened multidose vials are submerged in water they are considered to be contaminated and must be discarded. Submerging frequentlyoccurs if crushed ice or ice cubes are used in cold boxes for transporting vaccines. 19The opportunity cost of contact with an infant always has higher value than the vaccine cost. Therefore, it is always recommended to open a vial of vaccine for one infant or a small number ofinfants.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 287. Tools available for reducing vaccine wastage None of the tools20 listed below is a panacea for reducing vaccine wastage. One tool may become more effective in reducing wastage if combined with other appropriatetools. Whatever tool is used, there is only one output control indicator that should NOT be negatively affected: vaccination coverage. This has to be borne in mind when appropriate tools are being selected. 7.1 Changing the vial size Naturally, the use of smaller vaccine presentations results in less vaccine wastage. GAVIrequires countries to target 15% vaccine wastage with multidose vials while only 5% is permitted for two-dose presentations. However, the decision to change the vial size for smaller presentations is not easy, as many other factors have to be considered. In some presentations there are not large differences in respect of the price per dose and the required storage volume. For example the costs per dose for 20-dose and 10- dose DTP vaccine are US$ 0.034 and $0.063 respectively. The 20-dose presentationrequires 2.5 cm 3 of cold storage volume per dose and the 10-dose presentation requires 3.0 cm3. Several examples of vaccine prices are given in Fig. 10. Fig. 10. Weighted average price per dose, 2002 prices, 20Tools include technological solutions as well as policies and practices.29 Supply Division 00.511.522.53 DTP TT Measles YF 1 dose 2 doses 10 doses 20 dosesUS$ per dose The storage volume per dose of vaccine also varies. It is determined by the type of vaccine, the number of doses per vial or ampoule, the physical size of the vial orampoule and the bulkiness of the external packaging. Donor-dependent countries should ensure that a safe worst-case figure is obtained for each antigen. This is because the manufacturer of a vaccine may not be known until a shipment arrives. Two of the most reliable sources of information on vaccine volumes are: the Guidelines on the international packaging and shipping of vaccines (WHO/V&B/01.05), Geneva, WHO,2001; and the Vaccine volume calculator (WHO/V&B/01.27). 21 In countries where vaccines are purchased directly from the national budget, figures should either be based on data obtained from all the manufacturers who regularly supply vaccines or from the latest version of the WHO Vaccine volume calculator . A comparison of volume requirements is given in Fig. 11. 21'Guidelines on the international packaging and shipping of vaccines' can be downloaded from: http://www (Memo) and http://www .who.int/vaccines-documents/excel/www586.xls .Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 30Fig. 11. WHO-recommended Measles MMR HepBcm3 per dose 1 dose 2 doses 10 doses 20 doses Deciding on the best size of a freeze-dried vaccine presentation is more complicated than for a liquid vaccine. World manufacturing capacity is not sufficient to provide all vaccines in single-dose form. Global freeze-drying capacity is already almost saturated. Thus, for example, single-dose MMR vaccine would cut global capacity 30-fold ascompared with multidose measles vaccine. Therefore, the decision to change to single- dose presentations should not be made without consideration of global needs, which can be verified through WHO's Vaccines and Biologicals Department. BCG is one of the freeze-dried vaccines for which many countries report quite high wastage rates. In 2001, UNICEF conducted a review of the cost-effectiveness of changing from a 20-dose vial to a 10-dose vial. The information that UNICEF received from BCG vaccine manufacturers indicated that making this change was not a viableoption for both economic and technical reasons. 23 The price given by BCG vaccine manufacturers for a 10-dose vial is only 2% to 8% lower than that of a 20-dose vial. Consequently, the price saving is not offset by the savings attributable to the reductionof wastage. The small price difference between the two vial sizes largely arises because key production economies are based on the number of vials produced rather than on the number of doses (including, the price of the special glass for ampoules/vials,production and lyophilization lines are based on ampoule/vial quantities rather than doses). Therefore, it is more economical to waste vaccine than to reduce the vial size. In addition, according to the BCG vaccine manufacturers supplying UNICEF, thepotency and the stability of the vaccine are likely to be affected by the reduced quantity of vaccine in each ampoule/vial to be diluted. Furthermore, the manufacturers claim that it would be very difficult to fill the correct amount of vaccine for a10-dose vial because of the very limited volume of freeze-dried vaccine involved. The mixing of different vial sizes in the same programme should be avoided except in 22Packed volume includes the vaccine vial, the packet containing the vaccine vial and any intermediate packaging. 23TechNet21 e-Forum. Post00478E. Vaccine wastage, 23 July 2002.31 WHO/V&B/03.18the case of supplementary immunization activities. Such mixing creates additional logistical difficulties. 7.2 Vaccine vial monitor Vaccines exhibit no visible change with heat exposure. Before the development of theVVM, health workers had no means of identifying whether vaccine had suffered damage from heat exposure at any point during transportation and/or storage. National recommendations for vaccine handling have consequently been very conservative inorder to prevent the use of vaccines damaged by heat. Health workers were trained to discard all vaccines after breaks or suspected breaks in the cold chain. If a health centre refrigerator malfunctions overnight, the vaccine is thrown away as soon as the problemis discovered. In some places, health workers are instructed to discard all vaccine that has been taken to the field twice without being used, even if no heat exposure has occurred. Such precautions against possible heat damage result in large amounts ofusable vaccine being discarded. The VVM can change this situation. Its gradual and irreversible colour change makes it possible to assess cumulative heat exposure and the remaining shelf-life of vaccines,even with vials which have been out of the cold chain or stored in a malfunctioning refrigerator. WHO recommends that VVMs be used in order to: ensure that administered vaccine has not been damaged by heat; reduce vaccine wastage; 24 facilitate immunization outreach, increase access and consequently increase immunization coverage; pinpoint cold chain problems; manage vaccine stocks. VVMs are time-temperature-sensitive labels attached to vaccine vials.25 Through a gradual and irreversible colour change the VVM warns health workers that a vaccine has been degraded by unacceptable exposure to heat and that it should be discarded. The colour change is related to the stability curve of the vaccine concerned.Once the colour change is complete the vial should no longer be used. In addition, changes in the appearance of a VVM before this limit is reached serve to guide health workers to use the most exposed vials of vaccine first. It should be notedthat VVMs do not directly measure vaccine potency but give information about the main factor affecting potency, i.e. heat exposure over a period of time. The VVM does not register information about freezing factors that may contribute tovaccine degradation. 24In some cases, VVM introduction may initially increase wastage. VVMs may lead to discards as they expose weaknesses in the cold chain that were unseen before VVM introduction. 25Quality of the cold chain: WHO-UNICEF policy statement on the use of vaccine vial monitors inimmunization services. WHO/V&B/99.18.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 32There are four different types of VVM designed for different types of vaccine, depending on their heat stability (Table 5). Table 5. VVM reaction rates by category of heat stability Category Days to end-point Days to end-point Time to end-point (Vaccine stability) at +37\u00b0C at +25\u00b0C +5\u00b0C VVM30 30 193 > 4 years (High stability) VVM14 14 90 > 3 years (Medium stability) VVM7 7 45 > 2 years (Moderate stability) VVM2 2 NA* 225 days (Least stable) * VVM (Arrhenius) reaction rates determined at two temperature points The commonly used EPI vaccines can be ranked according to their sensitivity to heat (Fig. 12). Fig. 12. Heat stability of vaccines OPV MeaslesDTP, YFBCGHib, DTTd, TT,HepBMost heat-sensitive Least heat-sensitive Depending on categories into which they fall, VVMs reach their end-points after different intervals. Thus, for example, VVM2 on OPV (the most heat-sensitive vaccine) reaches its end-point in 48 hours at 37oC, whereas VVM30 on HepB (one of the most heat-stable vaccines) takes 30 days to reach its end-point at thistemperature.33 WHO/V&B/03.18Fig. 13.

For the first round, 650 000 doses were distributed. About 400 000 were used; 16 000 were returned to the Lokichokio primary store, of which 1370 showed some heatexposure and none were past the discard point. 26 The same exercise without VVMs would have resulted in discarding all unused vaccines taken to outreach. Turkey documented a dramatic VVM impact both on unopened and opened OPV vials duringNIDs in 1997. 27 Wastage reduction in unopened vials was reported to be 77% while it was 45% in opened vials. In Nepal, 33% wastage reduction was reported in opened OPV vials during NIDs in 1997.28 In Bhutan, over a period of six months in 1997- 1998, colour changes in VVMs led to OPV wastage of only 0.6%.29 In Viet Nam, in a 2002 measles campaign, hard-to-reach communes with very weak and/or no cold chain were reached mainly by relying on VVM potential. This resulted in reducing the numberof supply trips and consequently the cost. 30 26SNIDs in southern Sudan. WHO, unpublished report, 11 October 1999. 27Afsar OZ, Altay B.

VVM on hepatitis B vaccine showing no heat exposure It is critical that all countries procuring vaccines from national budgets through international bid-tender include VVMs in tender specifications. All donor countries and agencies should also have policies for including VVMs in their donations. At the 19th Immunization Managers Meeting of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region held in Casablanca, Morocco on 24-27 June 2002, the following recommendations were adopted on VVM inclusion in tender documents. Morocco recommendations, June 2002: vaccine quality and management 2. Vaccine security is becoming an increasing problem both at the global level and in the Region. This situation is exacerbated by multinational vaccine manufacturers leaving the traditional vaccine market in order to take advantage of higher profit margins and by the increasing divergence of vaccine products used betweendeveloping and industrialized countries. In addition, planning to meet supply is adversely affected by a lack of good planning for vaccine needs on the part of countries, and by strategies for utilization which are less than optimal. To contributeto vaccine security, countries are urged to develop demand forecasting, to establish plans to improve vaccine management and to consider vaccine availability when reviewing or planning for new immunization strategies. 4. Vaccine wastage should be monitored monthly at all immunization points and should be evaluated together with immunization coverage. 5.Countries purchasing their own vaccines should include VVMs among the minimum requirements for all EPI vaccines in tender documents. 6. Countries are encouraged to conduct studies on documenting the freezing risk/ problem of freeze-sensitive vaccines, to take appropriate measures to protect them from freezing on arrival and during storage and transportation, and to report the results in 2003. 35 WHO/V&B/03.18The donation policy of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency stipulates that vaccines have to meet WHO-UNICEF criteria, including the use of VVMs. VVMs can be incorporated into national regulatory authority (NRA) documents as part of the minimum requirements for all vaccines. Thus, for example, in 2002 the Republic of Korea, during restructuring of its NRA, included VVMs as a cold chainimprovement tool for all vaccines. 7.3 Multidose vial policy The multidose vial policy (MDVP), previously called the open vial policy, wasintroduced in 1995 and revised in 2000 on the basis of scientific data collected on the safety and potency of vaccines recommended for use in immunization services by WHO. 31 The revised policy applies only to OPV, DTP , TT, DT, HepB, and liquid formulations of Hib vaccines that meet WHO requirements for potency and temperature stability, are packaged according to ISO standard 8362-2, and contain an appropriate concentration of preservative, such as (injectable vaccines only). Multidose vials of OPV , DTP, TT, DT, hepatitis B, and liquid formulations of Hib vaccines from which one or more doses of vaccine have been removed during an immunization session may be used in subsequent immunization sessions for up to a maximum of four weeks provided that all the following conditions are met: the expiry date has not passed; the vaccine is stored under appropriate cold chain conditions; the vaccine vial septum has not been submerged in water; aseptic technique has been used to withdraw all doses; the VVM, if attached, has not reached its discard point. Liquid injectable vaccines such as DTP , TT, DT and hepatitis B contain preservatives that prevent the growth of bacterial contamination. Should contamination take placewithin a vial, the preservatives prevent any increase in bacterial growth over time and actually decrease the level of contamination. The implementation of MDVP requires a series of operational provisions such as the proper training of personnel, the availability of AD syringes to ensure aseptic technique,training in and use of VVMs for monitoring heat exposure, and the re-evaluation of vaccine wastage rates for vaccine forecasting. It is estimated that the adoption of MDVP would result in wastage rates declining to approximately15-20%. The implementation of MDVP in Bhutan resulted in dramatic decreases in the wastage of liquid vaccines. In comparison with baseline data from the districts, wastage decreased by 49% for OPV, 27% HepB vaccine. 31WHO policy statement: The use of opened multidose vials in subsequent immunization sessions.

PATH, November 1999.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 36The revised policy does not change recommended procedures for handling vaccines that must be reconstituted, that is, BCG, measles, YF and some formulations of Hib vaccines.33 Once they are reconstituted, vials of these vaccines must be kept at 2-8\u00baC and must be discarded at the end of each immunization session or after six hours, whichever comes first. Most freeze-dried (lyophilized) vaccines do not contain preservatives and consequently must not be kept for longer than the manufacturer's recommended limit and neverlonger than six hours after they are reconstituted. Avoiding programme errors Toxic shock . Reconstituted vaccine is an ideal environment for growing a number of organisms. Live vaccines do not contain a preservative (as many of the other types ofvaccines in multi-dose containers do). Once the vial is contaminated with staphylococcus or other organism from improper handling, the organism grows extremely fast. As it grows, it produces a deadly chemical called a toxin. If a contaminatedvial is kept (even in the refrigerator), by morning there is enough toxin in the vial to kill an infant. A number of instances are recorded when several infants have been given the remains of the reconstituted measles vaccine from the previous day. They havedied in shock several hours later. This is called \"toxic shock syndrome\". If toxic shock syndrome happens, at least two programme errors have occurred together: non-sterile reconstitution/ injection technique, and failing to discard the vaccine after 6 hours. from WHO, Vaccines and Biologicals Update, Vol.34, December 2000 7.4 Interagency coordination committees Interagency coordination committees (ICCs) could be used in a very dynamic way to review different aspects of immunization programmes, including vaccine wastage, forecasting, and the coordination of donors' efforts in order to avoid more vaccinesarriving in countries than can be utilized. 33Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), now in use in the immunization services of several countries, is available in different formulations and combinations, including liquid single-antigen,liquid combined with other antigens, and freeze-dried for reconstitution with a diluent or withanother liquid vaccine (DTP). All liquid formulations of Hib vaccine contain a preservative andcan be used in subsequent immunization sessions. The freeze-dried formulation contains nopreservative. After reconstitution with a diluent it must be discarded at the end of the session orwithin six hours, whichever comes first (as for BCG, measles, and YF). Certain formulations oflyophilized Hib vaccine are supplied with DTP liquid vaccine. However, although these can be used safely over an extended period, implementing a decision to use them requires additionalmanagement and supervision activities, and is not therefore recommended in the absence ofspecific training of personnel.37 WHO/V&B/03.187.5 Earliest-expiry-first-out principle EEFO handling is safer than first-in-first-out (FIFO) handling. In general, when two batches of vaccine are delivered at different times, the second to arrive has alater expiry date than the other. However, this is not always the case, particularly when vaccines are obtained from different sources. The expiry date should always be checked and the vaccine with the shortest shelf-life should be distributed first, even ifit arrived last. All stocks must be distributed well before their expiry date is reached in order to allow sufficient time for them to pass through the distribution system and reach the user. Newly arrived stocks generally have a longer period before expiry than thosewhich have been in storage for some time. Thus, older stocks with shorter expiry dates should normally be distributed first so as to ensure that supplies are properly rotated and that no batch or lot remains too long in storage. All vaccines and diluentsmust be systematically arranged in the store so as to facilitate an EEFO stock management system. During the period when vaccines remain in storage, the expiry dates of the stock should be checked regularly to ensure that older batches are distributed before more recent arrivals. In addition, the integrity of the stocks should be checked by reviewing the status of the VVM on each vial. Any significant colour change in a VVM duringthe period that vaccines have remained in storage indicates a weakness in the cold chain system. Repair or maintenance of the cold chain equipment may be needed. Heat-exposed vaccine may have to be issued ahead of its EEFO sequence, and in such cases the reason should be recorded. However, this measure should be taken with care because it may cause a displaced batch to reach its expiry date before it can be used. It is also necessary to consider whether the vaccine is being sent to a place where it willbe used quickly or to a place where it will remain in storage longer. However, the remaining shelf-life of a vaccine as indicated by the expiry date may be short. In this event the VVM indication may, exceptionally, be ignored when a decision is beingmade on which vaccine to issue first. In principle, four factors should be taken into account in the decision-making process: the remaining shelf-life of the vaccine, the VVM indication, expected dispatches and the possibility of full consumption of issuedvaccine. 7.6 Improved procurement practices Improved procurement practices mean better vaccine forecasting with more realisticwastage rates in order to prevent the arrival of excess amounts of vaccine. It is quite important that countries understand the implications of all vaccine management functions (session size planning, forecasting, use of diluents, reducingwastage) so that the use of scarce vaccines can be optimized.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 38WHO/UNICEF responding to scarce vaccine supply market \"... In response to the SAGE recommendations of 2001, WHO and UNICEF have further intensified their work with vaccine manufacturing partners in industrialized, middle income and developing countries through direct discussions, meetings, andthrough their affiliations with IFPMA and DCVMN . In addition, substantial work has been done to inventory accurate production and capacity figures for all vaccines for human use produced by manufacturers, in as muchas this is possible, while gathering demand related data for specific vaccines. Extensive work has been done in the area of vaccine management to better manage the issues of cold chain, logistics and distribution at country level....\" S. McKinney, presentation to SAGE, 2002 7.7 Optimizing immunization session frequency with session size and vial size Clearly, wastage can be reduced by increasing the size of sessions (a session as often as enough children can be assembled to use up a whole vial) and decreasing their frequency. However, this may result in compromising coverage. Among the tools available forreducing wastage, that of session size has the greatest potential for negatively affecting vaccination coverage. Consequently, this option should be reviewed with great caution before putting it into practice. If a selected approach to reduce vaccine wastage results also in reducing immunization coverage, consider other approaches. 7.8 Prevention of freezing The freezing of vaccines has been well documented but remains one of the poorly addressed problems in vaccine management. With the introduction through GAVI of expensive new vaccines such as HepB, the most freeze-sensitive vaccine,vaccine freezing has become a topic on which national managers seek advice. Previously, when freezing occurred in a full load of DTP in a 108-litre ice-lined refrigerator (ILR), the cost of the loss was around US$ 1500, whereas today if a full load of HepB werefrozen in the same refrigerator the loss would more than five times greater, i.e. $8200. Vaccine freezing is preventable and should therefore be treated as unacceptable. All possible measures should be taken to prevent wastage attributable to this cause. The freezing of vaccines may occur when vials are exposed to freezing temperatures either during storage or transportation (Table 6). Studies have shown freeze damage to vaccines at all levels of the cold chain.39 WHO/V&B/03.18Table 6. Where vaccines are exposed to freezing temperatures During Locations Cold rooms Environments with low ambient temperature Refrigerators Air cargo Cold boxes with ice or ice packs In order to avoid freezing in cold rooms, the following safety measures should be taken. Refrigeration units should be arranged so that no shelving lies within the plume of cold air close to the evaporator. Alternatively, the evaporator should be fitted with a mesh cage to prevent vaccine being stored within the danger zone. Ceiling-mounted units should not be positioned directly above shelving units. Instead they should be mounted in the centre of circulation aisles. If they have to be mounted above a shelving unit, the top shelf should be at least 75 cmbelow the evaporator and vaccines should not be stacked in the danger zone. The air outlet from ceiling-mounted evaporators should be directed away from any shelving in close proximity. In cold climates the temperature inside poorly or intermittently heated buildings where vaccine is stored can easily drop to near or below 0\u00b0C. In this circumstance, vaccinestored in refrigerators and cold rooms is likely to freeze. HepB vaccine freezes and is destroyed at -0.5\u00b0C. Toxoids such as DTP, DT and TT freeze and are destroyed in the temperature range of approximately -5\u00b0C to -10\u00b0C. There are two solutions to this problem. 1. Permanently heat the vaccine store: None of the vaccine refrigerators that currently meet WHO specifications offer any protection against ambient temperatures close to or below freezing. Work is being done to overcome thisproblem and the situation may change. Meanwhile, reliable seven-day-a-week heating is essential in stores or health facilities where vaccines are kept in refrigerators. 2. Heat the cold room: Cold rooms at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C should be fitted with frost protection heater circuits unless the space containing the cold room ispermanently heated and the heating system is totally reliable. Freeze-sensitive vaccines should NOT be stored within 20 cm of the base of an ice-lined refrigerator. Some ILR models have a mark inside the cabinet which indicates areas potentially dangerous for the storage of these vaccines.TransportationStorageField guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 40Other ways to reduce freezing in refrigerators are as follows. Do not adjust thermostats when vaccines arrive or try to cool a refrigerator quickly after a power outage. Set the thermostat so that the refrigerator temperature is around 4\u00b0C during the coldest part of the day. Monitor temperatures first thing in the morning and during the hottest part of the day. Once the 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C range is achieved, do not adjust the thermostat. In RCWs, store freeze-sensitive vaccines well away from the evaporator plate. Do not remove the separator wall in RCWs. The conditioning of ice packs is the key to preventing freezing through the use of frozen ice packs during vaccine transportation. Conditioning should be incorporated as a standard practice in vaccine packaging areas. Alternatively, cool water packs cansafely be used with cold boxes for transportation not exceeding 48 hours. (See Annex 5 for summary of use of cool water packs in vaccine transportation.) Conditioning ice packs When icepacks are removed from a freezer at (say) - 25\u00b0C they need to be kept at room temperature for long enough to allow the temperature of the ice at the core of the icepack to rise to 0\u00b0C. This process is called \"conditioning\". The standard advice hasbeen that an icepack is adequately \"conditioned\" as soon as beads of water cover its surface. Experiments have shown that this is not always the case and that cold-sensitive vaccines -particularly HepB - can still freeze inside the cold box even when icepackshave apparently been conditioned correctly. When icepacks are laid out on a table they create their own microclimate. This extends the conditioning process. The following procedure is recommended: Lay out icepacks, preferably in single rows but never in more than two rows. Leave a 5cm space all round each icepack. Wait until there is a small amount of liquid water inside the icepacks. This will take up to one hour at +20\u00b0C ambient temperature and rather less at highertemperatures. Shake one of the icepacks every few minutes. The ice is conditioned as soon as it begins to move about slightly inside its container. From: Establishing and improving primary and intermediate cold stores for vaccines, WHO/V&B/02.3441 WHO/V&B/03.187.9 Safe immunization practices For all vaccines, including freeze-dried vaccines, safe immunization injection practices must be followed. A new sterile syringe and needle must be used for each new dosegiven, and the correct route and dosage must also be observed for each type of vaccine. 7.10 Improved vaccine management practices Because of the number of changes in vaccines, presentations and global vaccine handlingpractices over the past several years, including the introduction of new and underused vaccines through the GAVI process, the need for training in vaccine management has increased. One of the influences that led GAVI to focus on infrastructure strengtheningwas the perception that cold chain and vaccine distribution mechanisms in countries were disintegrating. A need for better vaccine management practices has also been demonstrated by high levels of wastage in many countries (and recorded on GAVIfund application forms), a lack of utilization of policies and equipment that would reduce vaccine wastage such as MDVP and VVMs, and adverse events attributable at least partially to inappropriate vaccine distribution practices. In the early days of EPI the focus was on developing a cadre of trained staff, and a great effort was put into the dissemination of training manuals and materials and ensuring that training was carried out at all levels. Pressures such as high staff turnoverrates and the introduction of new vaccines and technologies mean that there is a vital requirement for training in better vaccine management practices.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 42Global Training Network on Vaccine Management The Global Training Network on Vaccine Management (GTN/VM) runs a series of training courses conducted on a regular basis by WHO accredited global training centres. Vaccine management is a generic term encompassing various aspects of activities, programmes and services involving the use and disposal of \"vaccines\", from the manufacturers to the end-users. Vaccines are delicate products, which are easilydestroyed if handled incorrectly. Experience has shown that cold chain and particularly, the national cold store are the most critical elements of any immunization system. Because vaccine management is composed of several service levels, plans related toeach level must be developed, and regularly updated to ensure an effective and efficient service delivery. These levels are: Inventory and forecasting Stock control Distribution Storing and handling of vaccines Long term replacement plans for equipment Standard procedures for use of vaccine in immunization programmes Monitoring systems for vaccine storage Transport management Operational management Currently three training courses are being conducted for different target audiences: \"Vaccine store management\" training course is designed for primary, intermediate cold store managers, and the cold chain managers at the ministerial level. National immunization managers are also included among the target group as the secondary audience because of their supervisory responsibilities over the cold stores. \"Vaccine management\" training course is designed for national and sub-national immunization managers. Although it addresses some of the issues of the field, such as implementation of multi dose vial policy, managerial aspect of these issues are takenas the focus. Operational details and/or how to train field health workers on these issues are not covered with this training. \"Vaccine management on wheels \" is a training course aimed at developing skills in the critical evaluation of national vaccine management systems and improving supervisory skills by making direct observations while travelling down the cold chain.This advanced course accepts participants who graduated from either the \"vaccine store management\" or \"vaccine management\" training courses.43 WHO/V&B/03.187.11 Prevention of submergence of vials in water In some programmes there may be no choice but to use crushed ice in transport boxes during peak outreach activities. If vaccines are not well protected,opened vials may be submerged in water from melting ice. These vials are considered as contaminated and must be discarded. The only way to prevent submergence is to use zip-lock bags. All opened and unopened vials must be kept in zip-lock bags inorder to prevent any direct contact with water. This practice also prevents labels from becoming wet and lost (vials without labels must be discarded).Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 44The introduction of new vaccines has presented a challenge in immunization services but has also brought considerable opportunities for better demand calculations andthe monitoring of immunization coverage and vaccine wastage. Countries receiving GAVI support are now requested to reduce their wastage rates to 15% for 10-dose and 20-dose presentations within three years. WHO reports indicate that vaccinewastage amounts to approximately 50% globally. No matter how successful a programme is, some vaccine wastage can be expected. Many factors influence vaccine wastage. Improved vaccine management practices arethe key to addressing vaccine wastage as a whole. Vaccine wastage is best classified as occurring in either unopened or opened vials. Wastage in unopened vials results from incorrect/inappropriate vaccine storage andtransportation practices and mainly occurs at or between primary and intermediate vaccine storage facilities. Wastage at the service level occurs as a consequence of a combination of many factors and mainly involves opened vials. All immunization points monitor their performance by monitoring immunization coverage. The monitoring of vaccine wastage rates on a regular basis by all immunization points brings additional value to this quality performance indicator. The analysis of immunization coverage and vaccine wastage rates over a period of time allows healthworkers and immunization managers to identify areas that need improvement. The evaluation of wastage in isolation, without any consideration of coverage, makes it impossible to conclude whether it should be considered high or acceptable. The management of a vaccine store is best evaluated through the monitoring of proportional vaccine wastage in unopened vials. The global criteria for effective vaccine management laid down in the WHO-UNICEF Effective Vaccine StoreManagement require cold stores not to discard more than 1% of vaccines that are handled. If the reasons for vaccine wastage are not known the problem cannot be addressed, because measures may not be appropriate and may result in compromising immunization coverage. The key concepts and activities associated with tackling vaccine wastage are indicated below.8. Conclusions45 WHO/V&B/03.18Monitor vaccine wastage regularly 1. All immunization points should monitor their vaccine usage and wastage on a monthly basis. This has to be done as a self-audit and not for the sake of submitting data to higher levels. 2. Vaccine stores should monitor their wastage rates on a monthly basis. 3. All immunization services should establish a sound vaccine wastage monitoring system. Sentinel reporting should be considered in preference to the compilationof data from all parts of the country concerned. 4. The minimum data that have to be collected at the service level are: start balance; doses received; doses discarded unopened; doses opened for use; number of children immunized. 5. The calculation of vaccine usage at the service level should always be encouraged as the first step. Vaccine usage can easily be calculated as follows: 6. Vaccine wastage can easily be calculated from the vaccine usage rate: 7. Vaccine stores should focus on handling performance, which can be expressed as proportional vaccine wastage in unopened vials. 8. Since vaccine wastage is calculated at two different settings, both figures from these calculations should be incorporated in demand forecast calculations. The wastage factor for a country is given by multiplying the wastage factors calculated from these two different wastage rates: 9. The vaccine wastage rate at the service level should be monitored against the immunization coverage for the same period. Any changes in the trends of wastage rate and immunization coverage should be carefully analysed.Number of children immunizedVaccine usage rate = x 100Start balance + doses received - end balance Vaccine wastage (rate) = 100 - vaccine usage rate. Number of doses discarded Start balance + number of doses receivedProportional vaccine wastage x 100 rate in unopened vials = Wastage factor =Wastage factor of proportional vaccine wastage rate calculated from storesWastage factor of vaccine wastage rate calculated from sentinel points xField guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 46Consider all factors when making a decision 10. The use of smaller vaccine presentations results in less vaccine wastage. However, changing the vial size so as to reduce vaccine wastage should be carefully studied,since there may be negative implications regarding vaccine storage volume,transportation cost and operations. Adopt global policies nationally so as to increase the effectiveness of the system 11. The effective use of VVMs not only ensures that vaccine administered has not been damaged by heat but also reduces vaccine wastage. VVM use also facilitates immunization outreach and increases access and, consequently, immunization coverage. 12. It is recommended that all countries procuring vaccines from their national budget include VVMs among the minimum requirements for vaccine purchase. 13. The implementation of MDVP results in dramatic decreases in the wastage of liquid vaccines, because multidose vials of vaccine from which one or more doses have been removed during an immunization session may be used in subsequent sessions for up to four weeks. 14. EEFO handling is safer than FIFO handling. It is strongly recommended that countries revise policy so as to adopt EEFO handling for issuing vaccines. 15. Countries should pay more attention to the implications of all vaccine management functions in order to optimize the use of fragile vaccine supplies. Prevent freezing 16. The freezing of vaccines is one of the major reasons for wastage. Freezing occurs at all levels of the cold chain. Practices that avoid the risk offreezing must be followed and promoted. Do not compromise immunization coverage 17. Whatever measures are taken to reduce vaccine wastage, they should not compromise immunization coverage. If a selected approach to reducing vaccinewastage results in reducing immunization coverage, other approaches shouldbe considered.47 WHO/V&B/03.181.

As previously discussed, specificand proportional rates help programme staff to understand where wastage is occurring and to choose the most appropriate remedies. In order to calculate detailed vaccine wastage rates the following information is required: start balance; doses received; doses discarded unopened; doses opened for use; number of children immunized. This information is recorded in various forms in many settings. If it is available, the following information can be generated monthly on the basis of the formulas given,without undue expenditure of time.Annex 2: Advanced vaccine wastage calculations Number of children immunizedVaccine usage rate = x 100Start balance + doses received - end balanceEnd balance = (start balance) + (doses received) - (doses discarded unopened) - (doses opened for use) Replacing the end balance formula in the above usage rate formula: Number of children immunizedVaccine usage rate = x 100Doses discarded unopened + doses opened for use The denominator indicates the number of doses issued during the period in question and includes doses discarded from unopened vials and doses opened for use. The formula can then be used to calculate the vaccine wastage rate: Vaccine wastage rate = 100 - vaccine usage rate.51 WHO/V&B/03.18Doses discarded unopened Start balance + doses received - end balance Doses opened for use - number of children immunized Start balance + doses received - end balance Doses discarded unopened Start balance + doses received - doses opened for use Doses opened for use - number of children immunized Doses opened for useThis wastage rate includes wastage in both unopened and opened vials. For routine purposes it may not be necessary to calculate the breakdown of this rate on a regular basis. Nevertheless, the availability of the information listed above makes it possible to calculate the following details: unopened-vial-specific vaccine wastage rate; opened-vial-specific rate proportional vaccine wastage rate in opened vials. Vial-specific wastage rates reveal behind overall wastage. wastage plus opened-vial-specific wastage always equals the vaccine wastage rate. However, the proportional vaccine wastage values for unopenedand opened vials do not equal the overall wastage. They are useful in indicating what proportions of unopened and opened vaccine are being wasted. The formulas for the above-mentioned indicators are as follows. Because the denominators for the vial-specific rates are the same, the sum of these two specific rates is equal to the overall wastage rate. However, the denominator in the proportional vaccine wastage rate in unopened vials is the number of unopened vialshandled during the period, whereas for opened vials the denominator is the total number of doses opened for use.Unopened-vial-specific vaccine wastage rate Opened-vial-specific vaccine wastage rate Proportional vaccine wastage rate in unopened vials Proportional vaccine wastage rate in opened vials= = = =x 100 x 100 x 100 x 100Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 52We can illustrate how these indicators work by referring to the following figures for DTP vaccine reported by Yenice Health Centre: start balance (1 July), 500 doses; doses received during July, 1000; doses discarded unopened in July, 160; doses opened for use, 740; number of children immunized in July, 640; end balance (end of month), 600 doses.

Relationship between vial-specific wastage, vaccine wastage and usage rates 71%Unopened-vial-specific vaccine wastage rate 11% Vaccine wastage rate 29% Vaccine usage rate Another way of calculating the vaccine wastage factor In addition to calculating the vaccine wastage factor as described in section 2.4 it can be calculated by means of other formulas. There is a more direct way of calculating the wastage factor than via usage and wastage rates. It involves replacing the vaccine usage rate formula in the wastage factor formulapresented below, to give the vaccine usage ratio of doses per administration. 100Vaccine wastage factor = Vaccine usage rate Substituting for vaccine usage rate (see section 2.3): x 100 Number of doses received during periodNumber of usable doses at the beginning of periodNumber of usable doses in stock at end of period+- 100Vaccine wastage factor = Number of doses administered (children immunized)Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 54The above formula uses stock records, which can be replaced with more detailed immunization records for another calculation. Both formulas would give the same result. The nominator of the above formula equals the sum of doses administered and wasted. When replaced with the above equation the new formula for the wastage factor would be:Number of usable doses at beginning of periodNumber of doses received during periodNumber of usable doses in stock at end of periodNumber of doses administered+- =Number of doses wasted+ Number Number of doses administered55 WHO/V&B/03.18How to define sentinel sites34 Principle The sampling unit for sentinel sites is the health care facility that performs immunization services. Two-stage cluster sampling is proposed as the easiest method to obtain a representative sample of health care facilities . Self-weighting is ensured in such a sample through (1) a choice of regions in which clusters are selected by using probability proportional to population size, and (2) equal numbers of sampling units in each cluster. First stage Division of the country into regions The country should be divided into regions or other administrative areas, e.g. districts, provinces, that are (1) non-overlapping, i.e. no village should be located in two regions,and (2) exhaustive. i.e. all geographical areas of the country are included. The level ofregions or other administrative areas should be chosen so that (1) the number exceeds eight and (2) each contains at least 10 primary health care facilities. If it is impossible to find regions with at least 10 such facilities, adjacent regions may be merged to formlarger ones containing a sufficient number of primary care facilities. Choice of regions with a probability proportional to population size From the whole country, eight geographical regions are selected with a probability proportional to the total population size. This is done in the following six steps. Step 1: Rank all regions in a table All regions should be entered in the first column of a table in the most convenient order (Table 7). Step 2: Determine the population of each region The population of each region should be entered in column 2 next to the name of the region (e.g. 30 000 for region 10, Table 7). Census data, even if outdated, or the best available equivalent, should be used.Annex 3: Monitoring vaccine wastage at sentinel sites 34Adapted from \"Tool for the assessment of injection safety\"(WHO/V&B/01.30).Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 56Step 3: Calculate the cumulative population size The cumulative population size should be calculated for each region and entered in column 3 next to the population size. For region 1, the cumulative population size is the population of region 1. For region 2, the cumulative population size is the population of region 1 + the population of region 2. For region n, the cumulativepopulation size is the population of region 1 + the population of region 2 + (...) + the population of region n, e.g. 565 000 for region 10 (Table 7). For the last region, the cumulative population size is the population of region 1 + the population of region2 + (...) + (...) + the population of the last region. The total should be the country's population. Step 4: Calculate the sampling interval The sampling interval s should be calculated by dividing the country population by eight (the number of regions selected). For example: 1 177 000/8 = 147 125 (Table 7). Step 5: Choose a random number between 1 and the sampling interval A number r should be selected at random between 1 and the sampling interval (country population divided by eight, the number of regions selected). For example: 85 350 (Table7). Within each of the eight regions selected, a cluster of 10 facilities is chosen where vaccine wastage is reported regularly. Step 6: Identify the clusters First cluster: column 4 of Table 7 should be used to identify the region in which the cluster is located. The first region selected is that for which the cumulative populationsize (column 3) is greater than the random number r, which is greater than the cumulative population size of the preceding region. The random number r should then be entered in column 4 opposite the region. Thus, for example, 85 350 is smaller than 100 000(cumulative population size for region 3) but greater than 70 000 (cumulative population size for region 2), so region 3 is selected as containing the first cluster (Table 7). Second cluster: The second region selected is that in which the cumulative population size (column 3) is greater than r + s, while r + s is greater than the cumulative population size of the preceding region. The number r + s should then be entered in column 4 corresponding to the region. Thus, for example, 85 350 + 147 125 = 232 475 is smaller than 425 000 (cumulative population size for region 7) but greaterthan 125 000 (cumulative population size for region 6), so region 7 is selected as containing the second cluster (Table 7). This procedure is followed eight times so as to select the regions by adding the sampling interval s each time to the number in column 4 and by identifying the region for which the cumulative population (column 3) is greater than the new number while the new number is greater than the cumulative population size of the preceding region. Insome cases the new number may fall in the same region. In this case, the region is selected twice, and 2 x 10 facilities are selected from this region. Thus region 7 is selected twice (Table 7).57 WHO/V&B/03.18Table 7.

A list of all facilities in the region should be obtained. Either random sampling or systematic sampling can be used to select the health care facilities for assessment.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 58Random sampling From the list of facilities, 10 are selected at random by means of a random number table (Annex 4) or serial numbers on bank notes. Systematic sampling Health care facilities in the region are displayed on a list and a ranking number is assigned to each facility. The total number of facilities is divided by 10 (the number ofhealth care facilities to be selected in the region) in order to obtain the sampling interval s'. A random number r' between 1 and the sampling interval s' is chosen. The health care facilities selected are those with ranking numbers r', r' + s', r' + (2 x s'), r' + (3 x s'), etc. until r' + (9 x s'). The sampling intervals s' and ranking numbers r' are different from those used for the selection of clusters (first stage). This sampling methodology is not possible if a list of facilities cannot be obtained. Sample size The total sample size is 8 x 10 = 80 health care facilities.59 WHO/V&B/03.18Table 8.

Ideally, in these situations, vaccine wastageshould be analysed against the immunization performance rate, calculated as the sum of[(children immunized with DTP1..2..3)*100/(target group for DTP1..DTP2..DTP3)]. For practicalpurposes, in the above formula given in the table the target group can also be multiplied bythenumber of doses given for a particular vaccine. In the case of DTP , column E includes all childrenwho received the 1 st, 2nd and 3rd doses of DTP. In coverage calculations, therefore, the target group should be multiplied by 3.Allow enough number of rows to cover all working days in a monthField guidelines for monitoring and Systematic data collection. Qualitative Research Method Series 10. California: Sage Publications; 1988.)Annex 4: Random numbers61 WHO/V&B/03.18Annex 5: Summary of WHO study on use of cool water packs for vaccine transportation Recent discussions initiated by TechNet21 on conditioning ice packs to prevent freezing have prompted WHO to take a close look at its recommendations on the transportationof vaccines. WHO completed a series of controlled laboratory and field tests to assess the impact of cool water packs (at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C) on the cold life of vaccine transportation boxes. The tests were conducted for the following reasons. 1. Current policy recommends that ice packs be fully conditioned. They must be kept at room temperature for a period of time in order to allow the temperatureof the ice at the core of each one to rise to 0\u00b0C. The only way to check this is to shake the ice pack and verify whether it begins to move about slightly inside its container. Field observations show that programmes face a serious complianceproblem in respect of conditioning. The practice is found to be impractical and unrealistic since it requires approximately more than one hour at an ambient temperature of +20\u00b0C. 2. The Guidelines on the international packaging and shipping of vaccines set two conditions for freeze-sensitive vaccines. One of them concerns the preventionof freezing: Vaccines must be packed to ensure that: the warmest storage temperature of the vaccine does not rise above +30\u00b0C in continuous outside ambient temperatures of +43\u00b0C for a period of at least 48 hours; for vaccines sensitive to freezing only, the coolest storage temperature of the vaccine must not fall below +2\u00b0C in continuous external temperatures of - 5\u00b0C for a period of at least 48 hours. The guidelines do not require frozen ice packs to be used for class B and class C packaging, which includes all freeze-sensitive vaccines. The current practice ofvaccine manufacturers is to use cold packs at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C for freeze-sensitiveproducts for which the freezing temperature is the most critical. 3. No technology is available to provide the necessary low temperatures for OPV while preventing freeze-sensitive vaccines from freezing in the same cold box. If freeze-sensitive vaccines are packed with OPV in the same box, wrapping thefreeze-sensitive vaccines in order to prevent freezing is ineffective.Field guidelines for monitoring and reducing vaccine wastage 62This study was conducted on the hypothesis that using cool water packs during vaccine transportation can safely replace the use of ice packs to prevent freezing of freeze- sensitive vaccines. The plan was to translate favourable results into a policy change in vaccine transportation, mainly focusing on: a recommendation to distinguish shipments of OPV from all other vaccines at country level; a recommendation to use cool water packs (+2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C) for the transportation of all vaccines other than OPV. At the request of WHO, laboratory and field evaluations were performed to characterize the thermal stability of cold boxes in which cool water packs were used instead of frozen ice packs in order to maintain cool conditions. The cold boxes/vaccine carriers included RCW25/CF, RCW2/CF (tested at CSCIR,South Africa), BK-VC 1.6CF, CB20-5U-CF (tested at Blow Kings, India) and the insulated international vaccine transport box (tested at BioFarma, Indonesia). VVMs were used to determine whether vaccine stability was maintained. The thermal stabilities of vaccine cold boxes commonly used for vaccine transportation were evaluated in the laboratory. Instead of frozen ice packs, ice packs were filled with tap water and cool to either +2\u00b0C or +8\u00b0C (cool water packs) and tested with vaccine carriers at ambient temperatures of +43\u00b0C and +32\u00b0C. One set of tests was done withoutcool water packs at an ambient temperature of +43\u00b0C. A set of four VVMs (VVM2, VVM7, VVM14, VVM30) were attached to the dummy vaccine vials, to which a thermocouple was also attached. Temperatures were monitored at five-minute intervalsusing a Grant Squirrel data logger: thermocouples recorded three distinct temperatures for each vaccine carrier. In addition to the laboratory studies, vaccine transportation with cool water packs was monitored in Nepal, Turkey, and Zimbabwe. Recorded temperature data were then used to calculate the percentage life of VVM used, on the assumption that if all other factors affecting vaccine stability besides heatwere controlled a VVM reading could be used as a proxy for commenting on the life of vaccine. With the worst-case scenario involving the use of the international shipping box (which does not have a proper lid seal) if cool water packs were used with a dummy vaccineload, the box being exposed to +43\u00b0C ambient temperature for a period of 48 hours, with the hottest thermocouple reading and this exposure being repeated four times, the life losses indicated in Fig. 17 would be recorded by VVMs.63 WHO/V&B/03.182.42.410.12.45.243.4 01 02 03 04 05 0TTHepBMeaslesBCGDTPOPV percentFig. 17. Percent life loss calculated on basis of VVM reaction following four times transportation between primary store, three-level intermediate stores and service level Each transportation is assumed to be done at a continuous temperature of +43\u00b0 C for a period of 48 hours with a minimum temperature reading inside the vaccine transport box recorded as+11.5\u00b0 C, a maximum of +25.3\u00b0 C, and an average of +18.9 \u00b0C throughout each journey. An analysis of the results of the \"no packs\" option showed that the highest temperature recorded was +41.2\u00b0C, with an average of +33.1\u00b0C, which is above the recommended value in the international shipping guidelines. Nevertheless, this could still be an optionfor highly heat-stable vaccines such as HepB and TT, provided that VVMs were attached to the vials. On the basis of these results, the use of cool water packs appears to be a legitimate and safe practice for vaccines other than OPV.IDepartment of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals Family and Community Health World Health Organization CH-1211 Geneva 27 Switzerland Fax: +41 22 791 4227 Email: vaccines@who.int or visit our web site at: http://www.who.int/vaccines-documents The World Health Organization has managed cooperation with its Member States and provided technical support in the field of vaccine-preventable diseases since 1975. In 2003, the office carrying out this function was renamed the WHO Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. The Department's goal is the achievement of a world in which all people at risk are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. Work towards this goal can be visualized as occurring along a continuum. The range of activities spans from research, development and evaluation of vaccines to implementation and evaluation of immunization programmes in countries. WHO facilitates and coordinates research and development on new vaccines and immunization-related technologies for viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases. Existing life-saving vaccines are further improved and new vaccines targeted at public health crises, such as HIV/AIDS and SARS, are discovered and tested (Initiative for Vaccine Research). The quality and safety of vaccines and other biological medicines is ensured through the development and establishment of global norms and standards (Quality Assurance and Safety of Biologicals).The evaluation of the impact of vaccine- preventable diseases informs decisions to introduce new vaccines. Optimal strategies and activities for reducing morbidity and mortality through the use of vaccines are implemented (Vaccine Assessment and Monitoring) . Efforts are directed towards reducing financial and technical barriers to the introduction of new and established vaccines and immunization-related technologies (Access to Technologies). Under the guidance of its Member States, WHO, in conjunction with outside world experts, develops and promotes policies and strategies to maximize the use and delivery of vaccines of public health importance. Countries are supported so that they acquire the technical and managerial skills, competence and infrastructure needed to achieve disease control and/or elimination and eradication objectives (Expanded Programme on Immunization).
