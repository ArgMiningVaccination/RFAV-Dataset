Families will often say the most important thing they look for when seeking child care is a healthy and safe environment. With this in mind, child care providers must include families, with cultural awareness and sensitivity, in their efforts to create healthy environments and promote healthy habits. The child care providers enrolled in the health and safety class may be new to the field or experienced providers who are taking the course to refresh their knowledge and assure they are up-to-date. Whatever their knowledge level is, encourage participants to engage families in the health and safety messages in this curriculum. You will find a short time period at the end of each section for the instructor to ask the class how and when they would communicate the concepts learned to the families in their programs. This will not only stimulate students' understanding of the importance of communicating with families, but will also assure that they understand the concepts themselves. Use Developmentally Appropriate Practices when Teaching Children Healthy Habits Developmentally appropriate practices are an important part of a quality child care program. Child care providers should keep the ability of the children in their care in mind. As children develop differently, the actual age of the child is less important than the ability of the child to act and understand concepts and tasks. Infants and toddlers whose hands must be washed after diaper-changing may need a different approach, depending on how independent they are. Some 24-month-olds may be able to step up to a sink, turn the water on, and wash their hands with minimal supervision; while others may need to be assisted at each step in the process. Both will probably want to spend a great deal of time learning from their experience with the water. Children respond to a positive and constructive manner and learn best from consistent, clear, gentle and timely reminders that are pleasant and fun. For example, rather than irritably repeating \"wash your hands,\" try singing a song about hand washing. TIPS FOR COMMUNICATING WITH FAMILIES Communicate without judgement \u2014 do not criticize anyone's parenting skills Review all health and safety policies prior to enrollment of a child. The health and safety of their children is a top priority, so this review will reassure the parent that the provider will be working to promote the well-being of the children in their care. Communicate any changes in health and safety policies at family meetings, by written notice in the primary language of the family (when possible), and informally as you greet the families at the beginning and end of the day. Communicate new knowledge gained on health and safety issues in newsletters, notes, handouts, emails, posted information, and social media \u2014 or any other method you can think of that will reach a particular family group. All of these steps will demonstrate to families that you are working in the best interest of their children.Curriculum Overview 4 California Childcare Health ProgramBecause children love to sing and respond well to positive reminders, your task will be easier, and the children will feel good about washing their hands. Incorporating action songs and blending health practices into the natural flow of the daily program makes it easier on everyone. Don't forget to have fun! Knowledge of the child care context and child care issues are woven into all content areas of the Preventive Health Training curriculum, including information on child development; up-to-date information on the required Preventive Health topics in Community Care Regulations 100000.30 b and California Health and Safety Code Section 1596.866; and information about cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity to address the rich diversity of children and families in California. TARGET AUDIENCE: Child care providers GROUP SIZE: 15 to 20 (ideal). No more than 30 students per instructor.Reference Preventive Health and Safety in the Child Care Setting, A Curriculum for the Training of Child Care Providers, Fourth Edition, Developed by the UCSF California Childcare Health Program with funding from the California Department of Education.

Prevention of infectious disease in the child care setting will help families and child care providers improve their quality of life and save time, health care costs, and lost work. Illnesses caused by infection with specific germs such as viruses, bacteria, funguses, and parasites are called infectious diseases. Communicable diseases are those illnesses that can be spread from one person to another either directly or indirectly. Infectious diseases that commonly occur among children are often communicable and may spread very easily from person to person. The word \"contagious\" is also used to describe communicable disease. Most illnesses are contagious before their signs and symptoms appear. Some people may pass the germs without having the symptoms or continue passing them even after the symptoms of illness are gone.Why Do Children in Child Care Settings Have More Illnesses? Anyone at any age can be infected with communicable illnesses, but young children are at greater risk because: They have not yet been exposed to many of the most common germs. Therefore, they have not yet built up resistance or immunity to them. They also have many habits that promote the spread of germs. For example, they play on the floor and often put their fingers, toys, and other objects in their mouths. In this way, germs enter and leave the body can be passed on to others. They have close contact with other children and adults. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.3How to Prevent the Spread of Illness How Are Illnesses Spread? Communicable diseases are spread from the source of infection to the exposed, vulnerable person (host). For this transmission to happen, three things are necessary. 1. Source of germs must be present. 2. Route or (ways) of transmission along which germs can be carried must be present. 3. A host or vulnerable person who is not immune to the germ must be present and come in contact with the germs. What Can You Do to Keep the Children and Adults in Your Program Healthy? Break the chain of transmission by breaking at least one of the three links. For best results, use more than one method of control in order to reduce the transmission of infectious disease. You can control the spread of communicable disease in three ways: At the source of infection or the \"first link\" by identification, treatment and, if necessary, isolation of the sick person. In the child care setting this is accomplished by doing a morning health check/ observation, and if necessary excluding ill children, referring them for medical care, and notifying health authorities when required. At the route of transmission or the \"second link\" by personal hygiene; proper cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting of objects and surfaces; using proper diapering techniques; proper hand washing; and ventilation. By protecting the vulnerable person or the \"third link\" through immunization and healthy habits, for example: hand washing, good nutrition, exercise, and getting enough sleep.Four Major Ways for the Spread of Illnesses or \"Routes of Transmission\" 1. Through direct contact with people or objects: Infections can spread by direct contact with an infected area of someone's body (for example, an open sore) or by contact with a surface that has infectious material on it. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites cause illnesses. Because young children are constantly touching their surroundings and the people around them, infections can spread easily among children and their caregivers in the child care setting. 2. Through the air or \"respiratory transmission\" (passing from the lungs, throat, or nose of one person to another person through the air): Respiratory illnesses are spread through microscopic, contagious droplets of fluids from the nose, eyes, or throat. When an infected person talks, sings, coughs, sneezes, or blows their nose, infectious droplets get into the air where they can be breathed in by another person. Droplets can also land on hands or objects such as toys or food, and can be touched, mouthed, or eaten by other persons. When the germs in these infected droplets come in contact with the nose, eyes, or mouth of an uninfected person, they can multiply and cause illness. 3. Through stool or \"fecal-oral\" transmission (transfer of a germ from an infected person's stool into another person's mouth): Some diseases are spread through exposure to germs in the stool (feces, bowel movement) or by what is known as the fecal-oral route. This means that germs leave the body of the infected person in their stool and enter the body of another person through their mouth. 1.4 California Childcare Health ProgramIn most situations this happens when hands or objects have become contaminated with a very small amount of stool (usually too small to be seen) are placed in the mouth. Or when food or water is contaminated with a very small amount of human or animal stool and then is eaten or drunk. Improperly prepared foods made from animals (for example, meat, milk, and eggs) can be the source of infection. Some infections, such as salmonella, may be spread through direct exposure to infected animals. 4. Through contact with blood and body fluids: Some infections are spread when blood from a person with an infection gets into the bloodstream of an uninfected person. Hepatitis B and C, and HIV/ AIDS are serious viral infections spread by contact with infected blood. Cyctomegalovirus (CMV) is an example of a disease spread by urine or saliva. These viruses can be spread when blood or body fluids containing the virus enters the blood stream of another person. Spread can also occur when infected blood or body fluids come in contact with skin that has open sores, is damaged by conditions such as eczema, or with a broken surface of the mucous membranes (such as the inside lining of the mouth, eyes, nose, rectum or genitals). An infected mother can also transmit these infections to her newborn infant. Once these viruses enter a person's body, they may stay for months or years. This person may appear to be healthy but can still spread the viruses. How to Reduce the Spread of Illnesses through Direct Contact Make sure staff and children wash their hands after contact with any body fluids. Wear disposable gloves when touching body fluids (including feces) or objects and surfaces contaminated with body fluids. Use running water for hand washing. Do not use basins or stoppered sinks, which can become contaminated with the germs. Use plain liquid soap and single-use disposable paper towels or single-use cloth towels. Always use single-use disposable tissues for wiping noses. Never use the same tissue for more than one child. Dispose of used tissues, wipes, and paper towels in a lined, covered, trash container with a foot pedal kept away from food and supplies.Follow recommended procedures for cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting toys and surfaces. Follow recommended procedures for diapering. Make sure that each child has their own crib or nap mat, sheets, pillow cases, and blankets. Do not allow children to share personal items such as combs, brushes, blankets, pillows, hats, or clothing. Store each child's dirty clothing separately in plastic bags and send it home for laundering. Wash and cover sores, boils, blisters, cuts, or scrapes promptly and wipe away eye discharge. Report rashes, sores, eye discharge, and severe itching to the family so they can contact their health care provider(s). How to Reduce the Spread of Respiratory Illnesses Provide ventilation. Air out the facility daily, even in winter. Encourage outdoor play. Teach children and staff to cough or sneeze into their elbow or sleeve. If they sneeze or cough into a hand or tissue, they must properly dispose of the tissue and wash their hands. Ensure that staff and children wash their hands after wiping or blowing noses; after contact with any fluids from nose, throat, or eye; and before preparing or eating food. Don't allow food or eating utensils to be shared. Clean and sanitize mouthed toys. Clean eating utensils carefully in soapy water; then rinse, sanitize, and air dry (known as the three sink method) or use a dishwasher to sanitize dishes and utensils. Use single-use disposable cups, or reusable cups that are cleaned and sanitized after each use. Wipe runny noses and eyes promptly, and wash hands afterwards. Use single-use disposable towels/tissues. Dispose of towels/tissues contaminated with fluids from nose, throat, or eye in a covered container with a plastic liner away from food and supplies. Don't kiss children on the lips; instead give children hugs. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.5How to Reduce the Spread of Infections through Stool Since children and staff who have digestive illnesses don't always feel sick or have diarrhea, the best method for preventing the spread of these diseases is to have standard precautions in place at your program. Many germs can survive on surfaces for periods ranging from hours to weeks. PRACTICE THE FOLLOWING: Strict enforcement of hand washing for adults and children. Environmental cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting with focus on diapering, toileting, and food preparation areas. Exclusion guidelines: Excluded children and staff may come back after treatment and when the diarrhea improves such that stool doesn't leak from the diaper and/or there are no toileting accidents. With some diarrheal illnesses, approval of the child's health provider is needed. How to Reduce the Spread of Diseases through Contact with Blood and Other Bodily Fluids Treat blood and other body fluids as if they were contagious. Wear protective gloves when handling blood, urine, and saliva. Transmission of illnesses spread through blood is very rare in the child care setting, and illnesses such as HIV/AIDS are not spread by casual, daily contact with infected persons. However, HIV can be transmitted where there is blood contact. For example: Touching blood while giving first aid with hands or body surfaces that have cuts or open sores Collision accidents where the skin of both people is broken and blood is exchanged Cleaning up blood after an accident with hands that have cuts or open sores Biting. The only way blood-to-blood exchange can happen through biting is for the following events to occur: There is an injury to the mouth of the biter. The bite creates a wound so serious that the skin is broken and blood flows. Blood is exchanged. One of the children involved is infected with HIV . STANDARD PRECAUTIONS: The infection control practices listed below should be followed for all children, whether or not they are infected with blood borne illnesses. Proper hand washing Proper use of gloves Proper disposal of waste and contaminated materials such as gloves, paper towels, and bandages Proper cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfection. Proper care of soiled clothing Immunization for all children and staff against Hepatitis B Teaching all children not to touch any blood except their own 1.6 California Childcare Health ProgramEXAMPLES: How Some Childhood Infectious Diseases Are Spread TransmissionHow the disease is spreadBehaviors that spreadExamples of diseasesPossible symptoms Air or Respiratory Breathing germs in the air Contact with infected saliva and mucusCoughing or sneezing into the air Kissing on the mouth Sharing mouthed toys Wiping noses without thorough hand washing Poor ventilationCold Flu Measles Tuberculosis (TB) ChickenpoxCoughing Fever Rash Runny nose Sore throat Stool or Fecal-Oral Mouth contact with items and hands contaminated by infected stoolDiapering and toileting or food preparation without thorough hand washing Sharing mouthed toys Unsafe food preparation Unsafe diapering proceduresSalmonella Shigella Giardia Pinworms Hand, foot and mouth disease Hepatitis A Polio E. coli Noro virusStomach ache Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Direct ContactContact with infected hair, skin and objectsTouching skin or hair which is infected Sharing clothing, hats and brushes which are infectedHerpes Ringworm Scabies Head lice Impetigo ChickenpoxRash Oozing sores Itching Visible nits or eggs Contact with Blood and Bodily FluidsContact with infected blood and sometimes other body fluidsSexual contact Changing bloody diapers without gloves Providing first aid without gloves Getting infected blood or body fluids into broken skin, eyes or mouthHIV/AIDS Hepatitis B & C Cytomegalovirus (CMV) HerpesFatigue Weight loss Yellow skin Weakened immune system Sores Fever Swollen lymph nodes Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.7Perform a quick health assessment of each child every day upon arrival and before the family leaves. This allows you to make a judgment about what is normal or not for each child, rather than to diagnose an illness. It also identifies problems early. Providers should do their quick check not in a formal exam routine, but as a casual observation of the child in their initial contact as they welcome the child. You are checking easily observable, simple signs of well- being. A health check is not a medical examination. It is not the way to enforce your policies with a parent. It is not a way to find reasons to exclude children. Exclusion of a child may result from a quick observation and your follow-up, but your goal is to know your children better and to provide good care. In a child care setting where lots of people are coming at the same time, it is hard to take a moment with each child. However, this welcoming routine can establish many things and is good child development policy. This contact will help you better understand each child, help the children feel comfortable and good about themselves, reduce the spread of illness by excluding children with obvious signs of illness, and foster better communications with families. Signs to Observe When conducting a morning health check, you should watch for the following: General mood and changes in behavior (happy, sad, cranky, sluggish, sleepy, unusual behavior) Fever or elevated body temperature (if there is a change in child's behavior or appearance) Skin rashes, itchy skin, or itchy scalp, unusual spots, swelling or bruises Complaints of pain and not feeling well Other signs and symptoms of disease (for example, severe coughing, sneezing, breathing difficulties, discharge from nose, ears or eyes, diarrhea, vomiting) Reported illness in child or family members since last date of attendanceUse All Your Senses to Check for Signs of Illness Listen to what the child and parents tell you about how the child is feeling. Is the child's voice hoarse, is he having trouble breathing, or is he coughing? Look at the child from her level. Observe for signs of crankiness, pain, discomfort or being tired. Does the child look pale, have a rash or sores, a runny nose or eyes? Feel the child's cheek and neck for warmth, clamminess or bumps as a casual way of greeting. Smell the child for unusual odor in their breath, diaper, or stool. Using Findings to Make Decisions If you have concerns about how a particular child looks or feels, discuss them with the parent right then. Perhaps the parent needs to take the child home. If you decide that the child will remain, be sure to discuss how you will care for the child and at what point you will call the parent. It is your decision, not the parent's, whether the program will accept responsibility for the ill child. If the child stays all day, make sure you inform the parent about changes in the child's health status. Simple information about activity level, appetite, food intake, bowel movements and nap-time can be invaluable to the family. Contrary to popular belief and practice, only a few illnesses require exclusion of sick children to ensure protection of other children and staff (see Exclusion for Illness Policy, page 1.72). When your child care setting agrees to allow mildly ill children to attend, take these steps to better meet their needs, and be sure to follow California regulations: Maintain a small room or area where they can spend quiet time while being supervised. Assign one staff person to remain with these children when others go outside.The Daily Morning Health CheckMODULE 1 / SECTION 2 Preventing the Spread of Infectious Diseases 1.8 California Childcare Health ProgramPOSTER California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.edu Rev. 06/2018Signs to Observe: General mood and changes in behavior Fever or elevated body temperature Skin rashes, unusual spots, swelling or bruises Complaints of pain and not feeling well Signs/symptoms of disease (severe coughing, sneezing, breathing difficulties, discharge from nose, ears or eyes, diarrhea, vomiting etc.) Reported illness in child or family members Use all of your senses . . . LOOK - for signs LISTEN - for complaints FEEL - for fever SMELL - for unusual odorMORNING HEALTH CHECK STOP DISEASE Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.9Faced with concerns about the spread of serious infections, hospitals and health centers use a successful technique that is also appropriate for child care settings. Rather than waiting to find out who is contagious, they treat everyone as a potentially infected person. The name of this infection control method is \"standard precautions,\" and it gives a set of guidelines to follow when you come into contact with body fluids and wastes that carry germs. It is not a lot of extra work and it really pays off. Many of us in child care are used to reacting to infections only when we notice the signs or symptoms of illness. We then rely on exclusion policies to control disease. But the germs causing disease have been spreading for days before children appear ill. Illnesses like colds, diarrhea, and skin and eye infections are often contagious 3-10 days before you might notice symptoms. Hepatitis and HIV/AIDS take an even longer period to develop symptoms. To effectively prevent the spread of communicable disease, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires workers who might come into contact with blood and other body fluids to practice the following infection control practices at all times with everyone: Hand washing Use of non-permeable gloves Environmental disinfection Proper disposal of waste materials OSHA requires a facility plan and annual training of staff members who may be exposed to blood as a condition of their employment. These rules apply only to child care workers who are employees.Standard Precautions 1.10 California Childcare Health ProgramSTANDARD AND UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS IN THE CHILD CARE SETTING What Are Standard and Universal Precautions? UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS is the term used for the guidelines that were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the 1980s to reduce the spread of infection to health care providers and patients in health care settings. STANDARD PRECAUTIONS is the new term used for an expansion of universal precautions, recognizing that any body fl uid may hold contagious germs. They are still primarily designed to prevent the spread of bloodborne disease (disease carried by blood or other body fl uids), but are also excellent measures to prevent the spread of infectious disease in group care settings such as child care facilities. Why Are Standard Precautions Needed? Standard precautions are designed to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infections. Germs that are spread through blood and body fl uids can come at any time from any person. You may not know if someone is infected with a virus such as hepatitis B or HIV , and the infected person may not even know. This is why you must behave as if every individual might be infected with any germ in all situations that place you in contact with blood or body fl uids. What Do Standard Precautions Consist of? Standard precautions include the following: HAND WASHING: after diapering or toileting children after handling body fl uids of any kind before and after giving fi rst aid (such as cleaning cuts and scratches or bloody noses) after cleaning up spills or objects contaminated with body fl uids after taking off your disposable gloves remember that wearing gloves does not mean that you don't have to wash your hands!WEAR NON-PERMEABLE, DISPOSABLE GLOVES: during contact with blood or body fl uids which contain blood (such as vomit or feces which contain blood you can see) when individuals have cuts, scratches or rashes which cause breaks in the skin of their hands ENVIRONMENTAL DISINFECTING should be done regularly and as needed. In the child care setting this means cleaning surfaces and objects that are soiled with blood or body fluids with soap and water, and then applying an EPA registered disinfectant according to label instructions. Wear gloves whenever handling blood. PROPER DISPOSAL OF MATERIALS that are soaked in or caked with blood requires double bagging in plastic bags that are securely tied. Send these items home with the child, or if you wash them, wash them separately from other items. Items used for procedures on children with special needs (such as lancets for fi nger sticks, or syringes for injections given by parents) require a special container for safe disposal. Parents can provide what is called a \"sharps container\" which safely stores the lancets or needles until the parent can take them home for disposal. Standard Precautions in Child Care Settings vs. Hospitals and Clinics Child care facilities follow the standard precautions in clinic and hospital settings with the following exceptions: Use of nonporous gloves is optional except when blood or blood-containing body fl uids may be involved. Gowns and masks are not required. Appropriate barriers include materials such as disposable diaper table paper, disposable towels, and surfaces that can be sanitized in group care settings. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.11What Else Am I Required To Do? The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also requires that all child care programs with staff (even family child care homes with assistants or volunteers) have an Exposure Control Plan for Bloodborne Pathogens. This plan must be in writing and include: EXPOSURE DETERMINATION. This is a list of the job titles or duties which might put an individual in contact with blood or blood-containing fl uids (such as fi rst aid, nose blowing, or diapering). METHODS OF COMPLIANCE . These are the ways you will assure your plan will work and which include written standard precautions and cleaning plans, training of staff in their use, and the availability of gloves. HEPATITIS B VACCINATION . This must be offered by the employer at no cost to staff. The vaccine series can begin either: Within 10 days of employment Within 24 hours after a potential blood exposure (for example, accidental contact with blood while administering first aid or diapering an infant with a bloody stool). Note: Hepatitis B is a series of three shots which must be given on a speci fic schedule. Now that all children are required to have the series before entering care, child care providers should be at a reduced risk of getting hepatitis B in a child care setting.EXPOSURE REPORTING PROCEDURES. These are required and will tell staff what to do if something happens which puts an employee in contact with blood on their broken skin (cuts, scratches, open rashes, or chapped skin) or on their mucous membranes (in the eye, mouth, or nose). There are also record-keeping requirements to document the exposure situation, whether or not the employee received a free medical exam and follow- up, and that the employee was offered the hepatitis B vaccination if they did not already have the series. TRAINING ON OSHA REGULATIONS. This must be provided to all staff at the time that they start work and must include: An explanation of how HIV (which causes AIDS) and HBV (which causes hepatitis B) are transmitted. An explanation of standard precautions and the exposure control plan for your program. For more information on OSHA requirements, contact the Cal/OSHA Consultation Service of fice. 1.12 California Childcare Health ProgramHand Washing HAND WASHING: The Most Important Infection Control Measure To Prevent Illness When caregivers, children and parents wash their hands at the proper times and with the proper technique, the amount of illness in child care can be drastically reduced. You may want to use liquid soap in your child care setting, as it is both easier and cheaper to use for hand washing. Bar soap is often left sitting in a pool of water, especially when many people are using it frequently. A soap bar, which is always wet, is a good place for germs to grow and multiply. When Should Hands Be Washed? When and how often hands are washed is more important than what they are washed with. Caregivers, children and parents should wash their hands upon arrival at the program, and at least: BEFORE AND AFTER: Eating/drinking or handling food (especially raw meat and poultry) Feeding a child Giving medication (particularly eye drops/ ointment, etc.) Playing in water that is used by more than one person AFTER: Toileting, diapering and assisting a child in the toilet Handling body fluids such as blood, urine, stool, vomit, saliva, mucus, etc. (including wiping noses) Cleaning up or handling garbage Playing or working outdoors Handling pets and other animals, their cages, or other pet objects Touching sick children, especially those with sores, cuts, or scrapes Removing gloves used for any purpose Hands are visibly dirty Applying sunscreen or insect repellentMost Important Concepts about Hand Washing The most important concepts to remember about hand washing are: Use running water which drains out \u2014 not a stoppered sink or container. A container of water spreads germs! Use plain, liquid soap. Antibacterial soap is not recommended: Both bacteria and viruses are common causes of illnesses, and antibacterial soaps are designed to kill bacteria \u2014 not viruses or fungus. They are not usually applied in a way that allows them to work properly, since they are not left on the skin long enough before being rinsed off. Studies have shown that there is little or no evidence of the antibacterial products offering any additional protection against bacteria. On the contrary, antibacterial products may add to the existing problem of antibiotic- resistant bacteria. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.13HAND WASHING SONG Ask children to sing this song to the tune of \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" while washing their hands. If children wash their hands with soap under running water during the time it takes to sing this song, they will have thoroughly cleaned them. Wash, wash, wash your hands. Play our handy game. Rub and scrub, and scrub and rub. Germs go down the drain. HEY! Wash, wash, wash your hands Play our handy game. Rub and scrub, and scrub and rub. Dirt goes down the drain. HEY!Wet your hands and apply soap. Rub your hands together for 20 seconds. This helps remove the germs. Rinse hands well under running water until all the soil and soap are gone. Turn off the faucet with a paper towel. The faucet is considered \"dirty\" at all times. If you touch it with clean hands, you will be recontaminated. Then throw the paper towel into a lined, covered trash container with a foot pedal. Frequent hand washing can worsen sores and cuts on the hands or cause cracked, dry skin. These areas are hard to clean and can contain germs. Cuts should be washed well with soap and water and kept covered with a dry, clean bandage. Having hand lotion at the sink for staff who must frequently wash their hands is a good way to prevent skin dryness and cracking. When assisting a child in hand washing, either hold the child (if an infant) or have the child stand on a safety step at a height at which the child's hands can hang freely under the running water. Assist the child in performing all the steps for proper hand washing and then wash your own hands. Hot water is not necessary, but warm water can be used for comfort and will help increase duration of hand washing. HAND WASHING TIPS Children love water play. If you make hand washing a pleasant time (sing songs such as \"Wash, wash, wash your hands\"), they will be more willing to wash regularly. Teach the children in your care good hand washing practices. Be sure their hands are washed when they arrive at the child care setting, before they eat or drink, after they use the toilet or have their diaper changed, and after they've touched a child who may be sick. Ideally, sinks should be located near all toileting and food areas. Locate your diapering area next to a sink whenever possible. If you are renovating or building new space, consider installing a sink with a touch-free faucet or a knee or elbow faucet handle to avoid concerns of contaminating your hands when turning off the water. Adults and children over age two years may use an alcohol based hand sanitizer, containing 60-95% alcohol, for visibly clean hands when there is no access to hand washing facilities (for example, when on a field trip). Follow manufacturer's directions on the product label. Keep hand sanitizers out of children's reach. Carefully supervise children using hand sanitizers and monitor for skin reactions. Hand sanitizers can make some skin conditions (for example, eczema) worse. 1.14 California Childcare Health ProgramPOSTER California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.edu Rev. 06/2018WASH YOUR HANDS PROPERLY STOP DISEASE 5.

Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.15POSTER California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.edu Rev. 12/2019WHEN TO WASH YOUR HANDS STOP DISEASE Upon arrival for the day, after breaks, or when moving from one child care group to another; Before and after: Preparing food or beverages; Eating, handling food, or feeding a child; Giving medication or applying a medical ointment or cream in which a break in the skin (e.g., sores, cuts, or scrapes) may be encountered; Playing in water that is used by more than one person; After: Using the toilet or helping a child use a toilet; Diapering; Handling bodily fluid (mucus, blood, vomit), from sneezing, wiping and blowing noses, from mouths, or from sores; Handling animals or cleaning up animal waste; Playing in sand, on wooden play sets, and outdoors; Cleaning or handling the garbage. Applying sunscreen and/or insect repellent. Based on: Caring for Our Children, Online Database,2019, Standard 3.2.2.1 1.16 California Childcare Health ProgramThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommend that you wear gloves in the following situations: When contact with blood or blood-containing fluids from a child is likely, particularly when the caregiver's hands have open cuts or sores (e.g., when using first aid for a child's cut, or changing a diaper with bloody diarrhea) When cleaning surfaces or handling clothes and supplies that have been contaminated with blood or gross contamination with body fluids, such as large amounts of vomit, urine, or stool When caring for oozing skin rashes or lesions When you provide mouth or eye care and special medical procedures such as finger prick for blood glucose test. Once the gloves are dirty, remove them correctly and discard them properly. Be careful that you don't contaminate your hands, other objects or people with the dirty gloves. Wash hands and change gloves between diaper changes. Do not reuse the gloves: this can spread germs from one child to another. Although gloves are not necessary for diaper changing, they may reduce contamination of providers' hands and reduce the presence of infectious disease as they provide a protective barrier, but they offer little protection beyond that achieved by a good hand washing. Some child care policies recommend that caregivers use gloves for all diaper changes or for all diaper changes with stool. Make sure to follow your policies. Using gloves at the proper times requires being prepared in advance. You may want to make gloves available on the playground, in the first aid kit, at the diaper- changing table, in the car on field trips, with the cleaning materials, and in your pockets.Gloves provide added protection from communicable disease only if used correctly. If you use gloves incorrectly, you actually risk spreading more germs than if you don't use gloves at all. Pay attention to your gloving technique so that you do not develop a false sense of security (and carelessness) when wearing gloves. It is important to know that certain products like barrier creams, no-soap hand cleansers or \"invisible gloves\" also provide a false sense of security and cannot be alternatives for protective gloves in child care settings. What Kind of Gloves Should I Use? Non-permeable, single-use, disposable gloves provide protection from blood-borne pathogens and infectious body fluids. Do not use food service or housekeeping gloves when handling blood or infectious body fluids because they might leak or tear. Avoid latex gloves as they can cause allergy, particularly for those who use them often. Nitrile gloves can be used with less risk of allergy. Gloves should never be used as a substitute for hand washing.Use of Disposable Gloves Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.17POSTER California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.edu Rev. 06/2018GLOVING STOP DISEASE 3. Remove each glove carefully. Grab the first glove at the palm and strip the glove off. Touch dirty surfaces only to dirty surfaces. 5. With the clean hand, strip the glove off from underneath at the wrist, turning the glove inside out. Touch clean surfaces only to clean surfaces.2. Provide appropriate care. 4. Ball up the dirty glove in the palm of the other gloved hand. 6. Discard the dirty gloves immediately in a step can. Wash your hands.1. Put on a clean pair of gloves. 1.18 California Childcare Health ProgramWHAT ARE CLEANING, SANITIZING, AND DISINFECTING? Sometimes these terms are used interchangeably, but they are not the same. They have different outcomes which the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) de fines as follows: To clean means to physically remove dirt, debris, and sticky fi lm from the surface by scrubbing, washing, wiping, and rinsing. You can clean with a mild soap or detergent, and water. To sanitize means to apply a product that reduces germs to safer levels. Sanitizing surfaces destroys enough germs to reduce the risk of becoming ill from contact with those surfaces. To disinfect means to apply a product that destroys nearly all germs when applied to hard, nonporous surfaces. Disinfecting is a higher level of germ killing. What Should I Sanitize? Sanitizing is recommended for food surfaces (dishes, utensils, cutting boards, high chair trays) and other objects intended for the mouth like paci fiers and teething toys. What Should I Disinfect? Disinfecting is recommended for hard non- porous surfaces such as toilets, changing tables, and other bathroom surfaces; blood spills and other potentially infectious body fl uids like vomit, urine, and feces. How Do I Know Which Product to Use? Sanitizing and disinfecting products are called antimicrobials. These products kill bacteria, viruses, fungi and mold on hard surfaces. The EPA sets standards for products to make sure that they kill germs and don't pose serious immediate health hazards to people. Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting All products used to sanitize or disinfect must be registered with the EPA. Only products with EPA registration numbers on the label can claim they the kill germs if used as directed. Product labels have information about how to use it to sanitize or disinfect, and which germs are killed. WHAT ABOUT BLEACH? Bleach is the most common product used for sanitizing and disinfecting in Early Care and Education (ECE) programs. If used correctly, bleach reliably sanitizes and disinfects hard, non- porous surfaces of most common and harmful bacteria and viruses. A small amount of bleach can be diluted with water and it is inexpensive. Are There Problems with Bleach? There are increasing concerns about the health effects of bleach, especially for children and staff with asthma. When bleach is applied to surfaces, fumes get into the air and can irritate the lungs, eyes, and the inside of the nose. For staff who mix bleach solutions, contact with full strength bleach can be even more harmful and can damage skin, eyes, and clothing. SAFER WAYS TO DILUTE BLEACH Use only EPA registered bleach and follow the directions on the label. Select a bottle made of opaque material. Dilute bleach with cool water and do not use more than the recommended amount of bleach. Make a fresh bleach solution daily; label the bottle with contents and the date mixed. Wear gloves and eye protection when diluting bleach. Use a funnel. Add bleach to the water rather than water to bleach to reduce fumes. Make sure the room is well ventilated. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.19SAFER USE OF BLEACH SOLUTIONS Before applying bleach, clean off dirt and debris with soap and water. If using a spray bottle, apply bleach using a heavy spray instead of a fi ne mist setting. Keep the surface wet with bleach according to label instructions (use a timer). This is called contact time or dwell time. Sanitize when children are not present. Ventilate the room and allow surfaces to dry completely before allowing children back. Store all chemicals out of reach of children in a way that will not tip or spill. Never mix or store ammonia with bleach or products that contain bleach. Caution: Always follow label instructions! Undiluted bleach comes in different concentrations (e.g. 8.25%, 6%, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite). Read the label for exact dilution instructions. Are There Alternatives to Bleach? Commercial products registered with the EPA as sanitizers or disinfectants may be used according to the directions on the label. Look for an EPA registration number. Follow instructions for dilution (different for sanitizing vs. disinfecting) and contact time. Check if the product is safe for food surfaces, if pre- cleaning is needed, and if rinsing is needed. Some child care programs are using EPA registered products with hydrogen peroxide, citric acid, or lactic acid as the active ingredient because they have fewer irritating fumes. In response to consumer demand, more of these products can be found in stores and online. Non- chemical equipment, like dishwashers and steam cleaners, can be used to sanitize in certain situations. New methods and technologies like high- quality micro fiber cloths and mops used with soap and water can also reduce germs. More studies need to be done to see if these alternative methods work as well as chemicals to sanitize in ECE (early care and education) environments. GREEN CLEANING What Is \"Green Cleaning\"? Green cleaning describes the growing trend of using cleaning products and methods that are safer for human health and the environment. By using products with less toxic ingredients, ECE programs can protect the health of children and staff and protect the environment. Environmentally friendly cleaning is accomplished by establishing policies and procedures and providing staff training in safe and effective cleaning practices. Green cleaning improves indoor air quality and is often less expensive. The goal of green cleaning in ECE programs is to create environments that support healthy growth and learning for children and show a commitment to a healthy work environment for staff. The key goals of green cleaning are to: keep the environment clean to protect children and staff from germs and triggers of illnesses such as asthma and allergies. protect children and staff from unnecessary exposure to chemicals in cleaning products that may cause harmful health effects. To accomplish these goals, choose cleaning products and develop policies carefully and provide training for classroom, kitchen, and custodial staff. In the past, the main priority for cleaning and sanitizing in ECE environments has been protecting children from the spread of infectious disease. But recent research suggests that the chemicals used to clean or kill germs may have harmful health effects. There are safer ways to protect children from the spread of infectious disease. For example, teaching children to wash their hands and making handwashing a routine practice in ECE is an effective policy for preventing the spread of germs that make children sick. 1.20 California Childcare Health ProgramRegular Cleaning Is Important The everyday, routine cleaning activities of sweeping, wiping, vacuuming and scrubbing remove dirt, oils and moisture that germs need to thrive. When there is less buildup of dirt and germs, there is less need for strong chemicals to clean and sanitize. Regular cleaning keeps dust, pollen, pesticides, and other particles out of the indoor environment and improves indoor air quality. Sanitizers are more effective at killing germs when the surface is clean. Please note that green cleaning alone does not disinfect or sanitize surfaces. See CCHP's Health and Safety Note, Sanitizing Safely and Effectively in ECE for more information on sanitizers and disinfectants. Steps to Keep Your Child Care Environment Clean Choose the right equipment and clean regularly to reduce the need for chemicals to clean, sanitize and disinfect. Use a vacuum cleaner with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. HEPA filtration vacuum cleaners trap mold spores, dust, dust mites, pet dander, and other irritating allergens from surfaces. Use microfiber mops and cloths. Microfiber mops and cloths are made from a strong, lint free synthetic fiber that is very absorbent. Dust, dirt and germs are attracted to and held tightly by the microfiber, so they are not spread from one area to another. Microfiber mop heads and cleaning cloths hold sufficient water for cleaning, yet don't drip, and so less cleaning product is needed. Microfiber mops are also lighter and easier to use than conventional mops. Place floor mats at building entryways. Teach children to clean their feet when entering the building. This may capture 80% of soil entering indoor areas and reduces the amount of soil that must be cleaned.Consider a policy that encourages people to remove their shoes when they come indoors. Ask staff and families to provide a pair of \"indoor\" shoes or slippers. Decrease clutter to make cleaning easier. Store equipment and supplies in plastic boxes with tight- fitting lids. Repair hard surfaces that have cracks, pits, or chips to reduce the buildup of dirt and germs. Encourage frequent hand washing using gentle soap and running water. Hand washing may play a larger role in preventing the spread of infectious illnesses than sanitizing and disinfecting. Choose cleaning products that are less toxic. This includes floor-care products used to maintain floor finishes since they are some of the most toxic products used in building maintenance. Open windows and change filters in your heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems to increase air circulation and improve indoor air quality. Many illnesses are spread by breathing in germs that linger in the air, rather than by contact with germs on surfaces, so be sure to provide good ventilation in your program. Check with your building manager to make sure the heating and ventilations systems are maintained. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.21Choosing Cleaning Products That Are Safer for People and the Environment Many cleaning products contain toxic chemicals. Children are easily exposed to the chemicals in cleaning products because they: Breathe in the chemicals that get into the air when these products are used Absorb chemicals through their skin when they touch surfaces that have chemical residues Mouth objects (for example, toys) and surfaces and swallow chemicals that are on those objects and surfaces Many consumers mistakenly believe that if the word \"green\" appears in the name of a cleaning product, then the product is safe. This is not necessarily true. The easiest, and most reliable, way to choose safer cleaning products is to choose products that have been certified by third-party programs such as the Green Seal and EcoLogo certification programs. See Resources for contact information. These groups identify cleaning products that: Contain the safest possible ingredients Perform well Are cost-effective Avoid added fragrances that can cause respiratory irritation and trigger asthma The certified cleaning product categories include general purpose cleaners, glass cleaners, bathroom cleaners, carpet cleaners, and floor cleaners. Choosing certified products that meet green standards is a good way to reduce toxins and make an immediate positive impact on the health of the ECE environment. To quickly identify these certified products, check the label for Green Seal or Ecologo certification. Avoid products that say POISON, DANGER, CAUTION, or WARNING. SAFER DISINFECTANTS The only program that certifies disinfectants that are safer for people and the environment is the EPA's DfE Antimicrobial Pesticide Pilot Project. If you see the DfE logo on an EPA-authorized disinfectant, you will know the product is: In the least hazardous EPA Toxicity Categories Unlikely to have carcinogenic or endocrine disruptor properties Unlikely to cause developmental, reproductive, or neurotoxic harm CLEANING UP BODY FLUID SPILLS Spills of body fluids, including blood, feces, nasal and eye discharges, saliva, urine, and vomit should be cleaned up immediately. Wear gloves. Be careful not to get any of the fluid you are cleaning up in your eyes, nose, mouth or any open sores you may have. Clean and disinfect any surfaces, such as countertops and floors, on which body fluids have been spilled. Discard fluid-contaminated material in a plastic bag that has been securely sealed. Mops used to clean up body fluids should be: Cleaned Rinsed with a disinfecting solution Wrung as dry as possible Hung to dry completely Be sure to wash your hands after cleaning up any spill even if you wore gloves. 1.22 California Childcare Health ProgramProper storage and disposal of garbage not only prevents the spread of disease, it also helps to prevent unpleasant odors and other problems with insects and rodents. Soiled items that are disposable (e.g., disposable diapers, gloves, paper towels, tissues) should be thrown away immediately in an appropriate trash or diaper container. Store garbage in water- and rodent-proof containers with tight lids. Use containers operated with a foot pedal (e.g., step can). This is especially recommended for diaper disposal. Use a plastic bag to line covered containers. Put the containers within reach of the diaper changing area, hand washing sink, and food preparation area. Empty garbage diaper containers daily. Clean and disinfect diaper containers at the end of the day. Make sure that infants and toddlers cannot knock over or reach into the containers.Disposal of Garbage Diapering and the use of potty chairs carry distinct risks to the child care environment. Since the changing area is one of the places where germs which cause disease are most likely to live and spread, these activities must be handled with extreme care and attention to sanitation. The Diapering Area The health and safety of the children in your child care setting demand that diapering be carried out in an environment that has been carefully planned. These are some important rules about the diapering area that should be remembered:Diapering/Toileting Don't wash or rinse diapers or clothes soiled with stool in the child care setting. Because of the risk of splashing and gross contamination of hands, sinks, and bathroom surfaces, rinsing increases the risk that you, other providers and the children would be exposed to germs that cause infection. All soiled clothing should be put in a plastic bag, securely closed, and sent home with the child without rinsing. (You may dump solid stool into a toilet.) You need to tell parents about this procedure and why it is important. They often request that diapers and training pants be rinsed out to avoid staining. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.23IMPORTANT RULES ABOUT DIAPERING Use the area only for diapering. Set up the diapering area as far as possible from any food handling area, ideally near a hand washing sink. Provide running water so hands can be washed immediately after a diaper is changed. Construct a diapering surface which is flat, safe and preferably at least three feet above the floor. Be sure this surface is clean, waterproof and free of cracks and crevices. Cover it with a disposable cover. Keep all creams, lotions and cleaning items out of reach of children. Never give a child any of these to play with while being diapered since they could be poisoned. Baby powder is not recommended because of risks of inhaling small talc particles. Use a guardrail or recessed area as an extra safety measure. Always keep a hand on the child. Never leave the child, even for a second.Using Toilet-Training Equipment The use of potty chairs in the child care setting should be discouraged. Potty chairs are difficult to keep clean and out of the reach of children. Small, flushable toilets or modified toilet seats and step stools are preferable. If potty chairs are used for toilet training, you should use them only in a bathroom area and out of reach of toilets or other potty chairs. After each use of a potty chair, you should: Immediately empty the contents into a toilet, being careful not to splash or touch the water in the toilet. Rinse the potty chair with water and empty into toilet. Wash the chair with soap and water. Consider using paper towels or disposable mop. Empty soapy water into toilet. Rinse again. Empty into toilet and flush. Spray with disinfectant according to label instructions. Air dry. Wash hands. Assist children in washing their hands. 1.24 California Childcare Health ProgramPOSTER California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.edu Rev. 05/2020DIAPERING PROCEDURES STOP DISEASE 1. Get prepared. Gather all diapering supplies so they are within reach, including a diaper, wipes, a plastic bag for soiled clothes, and a plastic-lined, hands- free, covered can. If diaper cream is needed, put some on a piece of facial tissue before you begin. Cover the diapering surface with disposable paper. Put on disposable gloves. 2. Place the child on the diapering table. Remove bottom clothes and any soiled clothing. Remove socks and shoes that cannot be kept clean. Avoid contact with soiled items. ALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE CHILD. 3. Unfasten the diaper and clean the child's diaper area. With the soiled diaper under the child, lift the child's legs to clean the child's bottom. Clean from front to back with a fresh wipe each time. 4. Dispose of the diaper and soiled items. Put soiled wipes in the soiled diaper. Remove the diaper and dispose of it in a plastic-lined, handsfree, covered can. If the disposable paper is soiled, use the paper that extends under the child's feet to fold up under the child's bottom. Remove gloves and dispose of them in hands- free can. Use a fresh wipe to clean your hands. Use a fresh wipe to clean the child's hands. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.25POSTER DIAPERING PROCEDURES STOP DISEASE California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.edu Rev. 05/20205. Put on a clean diaper and dress the child. Put a clean diaper under the child. Apply diaper cream with a tissue as needed. Fasten the diaper, and dress the child. 6. Wash the child's hands. Moisten hands and apply liquid or foam soap to hand surfaces from finger tips to wrists. Rinse with running water. Dry with a single use paper or cloth towel. Return the child to a supervised area away from the diapering table. 7. Clean and disinfect the diaper changing surface. Discard the paper liner. Remove any visible soil with soap and water. Apply EPA-registered disinfectant and use according to label instructions. Be sure to leave the disinfectant on the surface for the required contact time. 8. Wash your hands with soap and running water, and record the diaper change in a report for parents. Include the time of diaper change and diaper contents. Note any problems such as skin redness, rashes, or loose stool. 1.26 California Childcare Health ProgramFOOD PREPARATION, HANDLING, AND STORAGE Unsafe food preparation, handling, or storage can quickly result in food being contaminated with germs, and may lead to illness if eaten. To prevent food from spreading illness, you can do some very simple things. When You Purchase Food Don't buy food in poor condition. Make sure that refrigerated food is cold to the touch, that frozen food is rock-solid, and canned goods are free of dents, cracks or bulging lids. Check the \"use by,\" \"sell by\" or \"expiration date\" on foods before purchase. Be sure that the meats and poultry you purchase have been inspected and passed for wholesomeness by federal or state inspectors. Keep packages of raw meat separate from other foods, particularly foods that are eaten fresh. Use only pasteurized milks, milk products and fruit juices. Do not use home-canned foods. Shop for meat, fish, poultry, and cold food last. Take foods straight home to the refrigerator; never leave food in a hot car. When You Store Food Store all perishable foods at temperatures that will prevent spoilage (refrigerator temperature, 40\u00b0 F or lower, and freezer temperature, 0\u00b0 F or lower.) Have a working thermometer to monitor the temperature in the refrigerator and freezer. Set up refrigerators so that there is enough shelf space to allow for air circulation around shelves and refrigerator walls. This will help maintain proper food temperatures. Always examine food when it arrives to make sure it is not spoiled, dirty, or infested with insects. Store unrefrigerated foods in clean, rodent- and insect-proof covered metal, glass, or hard plastic containers. (Large shortening cans available from bakeries are ideal for storing flour and other commodities.)Food Safety Store containers of food above the floor (at least 6\") on racks or other clean slotted surfaces that permit air circulation. Keep storerooms dry and free from leaky plumbing or drainage problems. Repair all holes and cracks in storerooms to prevent insect and rodent infestation. Keep storerooms cool (about 60\u00b0 F) to increase the food's shelf life. Store all food items separately from non-food items. Use an inventory system: the first food stored is the first food used. This will ensure that stored food is rotated. Pay close attention to expiration dates, especially on foods that spoil easily (dairy products, mayonnaise). When You Prepare Food Keep everything clean by following these hygiene procedures: Wear clean clothes, maintain a high standard of personal cleanliness, and carry out strict hygiene procedures during working hours. Wash hands carefully and thoroughly before preparing and serving food. Keep hands clean while handling food, surfaces, dishes, and utensils. Do not prepare or serve food while ill with a communicable disease. Do not diaper children or assist with toileting when you are handling food. Wash all raw fruits and vegetables before use. Wash tops of cans before opening. Keep work surfaces, utensils, towels, dish cloths, and appliances clean. Thaw frozen meat, poultry or fish in the refrigerator or put quick-thaw foods in plastic bags under cold running water for immediate preparation. Do not thaw frozen foods by allowing them to stand at room temperature. Keep raw meat and poultry (and their juices) away from other food and preparation surfaces to avoid spreading bacteria in the kitchen. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.27Cook thoroughly! Use a meat thermometer to check internal temperatures to be sure food has been cooked evenly. Use a thermometer to check the cooked temperature of poultry, stuffing (cook in separate pan from poultry or meat) and pork/pork products (minimum of 165\u00b0 F). Heat foods to 140\u00b0 F. Never reuse a spoon for cooking that was used for tasting. Cut food into pieces smaller than 1/4 inch for infants and 1/2 inch for toddlers. Prepare these foods as quickly as possible once removed from a refrigerator, serve them immediately, and refrigerate leftovers immediately: Meat salads, poultry salads, egg salads, seafood salads and potato salads Cream-filled desserts or puddings Other prepared foods containing milk, meat, poultry, fish and/or eggs. When You Serve the Food Serve food promptly after preparation or cooking. Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Serve food on a table that was cleaned and sanitized before use. Use clean or disposable plates, cups and utensils. Make sure that all children and adults wash their hands before serving and eating food. Do not allow children to share food or drinks. Do not serve food or drinks in dishes which might contain lead. When You Handle the Leftovers Refrigerate leftovers immediately or discard. Prevent the growth of bacteria by keeping foods at temperatures lower than 40\u00ba F or higher than 140\u00ba F during transportation and while holding until served. Bacteria multiply most rapidly between 40\u00ba F and 140\u00ba F. Cover or completely wrap foods during transportation. Never reuse a spoon that has been used for tasting. Reserve food for second servings at safe temperatures in the kitchen.Leftover food from serving bowls on the table must be thrown away with these possible exceptions: Raw fruits and vegetables that can be thoroughly washed. Packaged foods that do not spoil. Place foods to be stored for reuse in shallow pans and refrigerate, or freeze immediately to rapidly bring temperature to 40\u00ba F or lower. Leftovers or prepared casseroles held in the refrigerator must be discarded after two days. Leftover foods should not be sent home with children or adults because of the hazards of bacterial growth during transport. Keep lunches brought from home in the refrigerator until lunchtime. HANDLING EQUIPMENT When You Clean and Care for Equipment PROVIDE EASY-TO-CLEAN EQUIPMENT AND UTENSILS: Use food contact surfaces and utensils that are easy to clean, nontoxic, corrosion-resistant, and nonabsorbent. Use disposable articles that are made of non-toxic materials. Do not reuse disposable articles. Install appliances so that they, and the areas around them, can be cleaned easily. Be sure food contact surfaces are free of cracks and crevices, pots and pans are free of pits and dents, and plates are free of chips and cracks. Cracks in any surface can hold germs. WASH EQUIPMENT FREQUENTLY: Clean range tops during food preparation as needed and on a daily basis. Clean ovens and overhead hoods at least weekly. Wash the inside and outside of refrigerators weekly. Clean and sanitize mixed-use tables before and after meals and snacks. 1.28 California Childcare Health ProgramAir dry all food contact surfaces after cleaning and sanitizing. Do not use reusable wiping cloths. Make sure that food contact surfaces and utensils are kept clean: Cloths used for wiping counters and tables should not be used for anything else. Scrape and presoak dishes, pots, pans and utensils if necessary, to remove food particles before washing. Wash highchair trays, bottles, and nipples in a dishwasher, if available. If the trays do not fit in the dishwasher, clean and sanitize after use. Use the proper concentration of suitable detergent for hand and machine dishwashing, according to package directions. When You Are Hand Washing Dishes The best way to wash, rinse, and sanitize dishes and eating utensils is to use a dishwasher. If a dishwasher is not available or cannot be installed, a three-compartment sink will be needed to wash, rinse, and sanitize dishes. A two-compartment or one-compartment sink can be used by adding one or two dishpans, as needed. In addition, you will need a dishrack with a drain board to allow dishes and utensils to air dry. It is best to use running water to rinse, because if you use a dishpan for rinsing, the water in this pan will be contaminated after the first dish is rinsed. TO WASH, RINSE, AND SANITIZE DISHES BY HAND: Fill one sink compartment or dishpan with hot tap water and dishwashing soap. Fill the second compartment or dishpan with hot water. Fill the third compartment or dishpan with a sanitizing product diluted according to the manufacturers instructions. Scrape dishes and utensils, and dispose of excess food. Dip scraped dish or utensil in the first sink compartment and wash thoroughly. Rinse dish or utensil in the second dishpan of clear water.Dip dish or utensil in the third dishpan of water and sanitizing solution according to label directions. Place the dish or utensil in the rack to air-dry. Pick up and touch clean spoons, knives and forks only by the handles, not by any part that will be in contact with food. Handle clean cups, glasses, and bowls so that fingers and thumbs do not touch the inside or the lip. Food preparation and dishwashing sinks should only be used for these activities, and should not be used for routine hand washing or diaper-changing activities. NOTE: If you do not have adequate facilities for cleaning and sanitizing dishes and utensils, use only disposable items. FOOD-BORNE DISEASE Contaminated food products are linked with large number of illnesses and deaths in people of all ages. However, children and especially those with weak immune systems are particularly at risk of illness from lots of food-borne germs. To reduce the risk of infection and disease from eating contaminated food products, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases recommends the following preventive measures: Unpasteurized milk and cheese. Children should not drink unpasteurized milk or eat unpasteurized cheese. Pasteurization is a method of preserving food by heating it to a certain point which will kill off harmful organisms but will not harm the flavor or quality of the food. This technique is mostly used with milk, fruit juices, cheeses, and egg products. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly endorses the use of pasteurized milk and recommends that parents and public health officials be fully informed of the important risks associated with consumption of unpasteurized milk. Eggs. Children should not eat raw or undercooked eggs, unpasteurized powdered eggs or products containing raw eggs. Ingestion of raw or improperly cooked eggs can produce severe salmonella disease. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.29Raw and undercooked meat. Children should not eat raw or undercooked meat or meat products, as they have been associated with disease. Knives, cutting boards, utensils, and plates used for raw meats should not be used for preparation of any food until the utensils have been cleaned and sanitized. Do not place cooked or barbecued meat back onto the plate that held the raw meat. Unpasteurized juices. Children should only drink pasteurized juice products unless the fruit is washed and freshly squeezed (i.e., orange juice) immediately before consumption. Consumption of packaged fruit and vegetable juices that have not undergone pasteurization or a comparable treatment has been associated with foodborne illness due to E. coli O157:H7 and salmonella species. Alfalfa sprouts. The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reaffirmed health advisories that persons who are at high risk for severe foodborne disease, including children, persons with compromised immune systems and elderly persons, should avoid eating raw alfalfa sprouts until intervention methods are implemented to improve the safety of these products. Fresh fruits and vegetables. Many fresh fruits and vegetables have been associated with disease because of contamination. All fruits and vegetables should be cleaned before eating. Knives, cutting boards, utensils, and plates used for raw meats should not be used for preparation of fresh fruits or vegetables until the utensils have been cleaned properly. Raw shellfish and fish. Many experts recommend that children should not eat raw shellfish, especially raw oysters. Some experts caution against children eating raw fish. Raw shellfish, including mussels, clams, oysters, scallops and other mollusks, have been associated with many germs and toxins. Honey. Children younger than one year of age should not be given honey unless the product has been certified to be free of Clostridium botulinum spores.SAFE STORAGE, HANDLING, AND FEEDING OF BREAST MILK AND INFANT FORMULA General Guidelines Feeding infants takes some extra care and preparation. Always wash your hands and utensils before handling breast milk, infant formulas, and foods. Be sure to follow directions on packages regarding expiration dates and preparations. BREAST MILK Breastfeeding provides numerous health benefits to young infants, including protection against infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites. It is an ideal source of infant nutrition, largely uncontaminated by environmental pathogens, and reduces some of the risks that are greater for infants in group care such as diarrhea, lower respiratory disease, otitis media, and SIDS. Breast milk is the best food to meet the nutritional needs of an infant from birth until 12 months of age. The clear advantage of breast milk over any formula suggests that child care providers promote breastfeeding for working mothers who are willing to nurse their babies and pump and supply their milk to child care facilities. It's important to store breast milk carefully. Use the following guidelines for storing breast milk: Label bottles of breast milk with the child's name and date. Breast milk can be stored in a refrigerator for up to 3 days from the time it was expressed. Place breast milk toward the back of the refrigerator where it is coldest. Keep a back-up supply of breast milk in the freezer. Breast milk can be frozen for up to 3 months from when it was expressed. Once frozen breast milk is thawed, use it within 24 hours and do not refreeze. Rotate fresh and frozen breast milk, using the oldest milk first. Promptly refrigerate. Store each child's breast milk in a separate container in the refrigerator. Never give breast milk intended for one child to another. 1.30 California Childcare Health ProgramBreast milk may appear thinner, paler or bluish in color compared to formula. This is normal. If it has been stored properly, it is completely safe and very nutritious for the infant. If expressed human milk is given to another child: Breast milk from a mother is specific to her own child and should be used only with the intended child. Risk of HIV transmission from breast milk that another child has drunk is believed to be low. However, if one child is mistakenly fed another child's bottle, or one child fed from a bottle that another child has dropped or put down, this should be seen as an accidental exposure to a potential HIV-contaminating body fluid. In such cases providers should: Inform the parents of the child who was given the wrong bottle and notify the child's health care provider of the exposure. Inform the mother who supplied the breast milk and ask if she has ever had an HIV test and, if so, would she be willing to share the results with the parents of the exposed child. INFANT FORMULA It is important for the infant's health that formula be prepared correctly and stored safely. Spoiled formula can make infants very sick. Germs can get into formula bottles from: The hands, nose, or throat of the person preparing the bottle The counter or work area A bottle that was not well cleaned Unclean water used to make the formula Formula stored too long A bottle left at room temperature Concentrated and powdered infant formula should be sent from the child's home in its original factory-sealed container and prepared according to package directions. If mixing formula with tap water, use only cold water. To prevent illness from shared bottles or giving incorrect formula, label each child's bottles and formula with the child's name and the date the formula was prepared. Refrigerate the bottles as soon as they arrive or are made, and discard formula after 12 hours.DO NOT warm infant formula or breast milk in a microwave oven. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.31Oral hygiene is the practice of keeping teeth and gums healthy. With good oral hygiene, the teeth will be clean and the mouth will have a clean and sweet odor. Tooth decay is the most common infectious disease in childhood, and bacteria in the mouth contribute to cavities. Fortunately, with good oral hygiene, regular dental care, and a healthy diet, children can lay the foundation for life long dental health. How To Promote Oral Health Your program can help prevent tooth decay by serving well-balanced nutritious food and by limiting sugary and sticky foods. You will be teaching preschool children dental health by helping them to brush their teeth and encouraging parents to get regular dental care for their children. Healthy Food for Teeth: Fresh fruit and vegetables make a great snack or dessert. Food with high amounts of sugar is linked to tooth decay. Germs in the mouth change the sugar in food to acid, which can eat a cavity in the tooth. Avoid serving candy, jelly, jam, cake, cookies, sugared gelatin and sweetened canned fruit. According to the Healthy Beverages in Child Care Act, serving sweetened drinks (for example, sweet tea, juice drinks, soda, flavored milk) to children is prohibited in licensed child care in California. Prevention of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay: Baby bottle tooth decay (BBTD) is one form of early childhood tooth decay which can result from the overuse of a baby bottle feeding of milk, formula, and juices. Babies should not be put to bed with a bottle at nap time or at night. And juice should never be served in a baby bottle.Oral Health Brushing Teeth: Although it can be difficult, brushing teeth in the child care setting helps children to develop good habits. To brush teeth properly and to prevent the spread of germs found in saliva and blood on toothbrushes: Always supervise children when they are brushing their teeth. Make sure that each child has their own toothbrush clearly labeled with their name. Do not allow children to share or borrow toothbrushes. Use fluoride toothpaste: Infants Preschoolers: pea-size amount. Instruct each child to brush their teeth. Using a paper cup, each child should rinse their mouth out with water, then spit out the toothpaste into the sink or a cup. Children need supervision and assistance brushing their teeth until at least 8 years old. Store each toothbrush so it cannot touch any other toothbrush, and allow it to air dry. Never \"disinfect\" toothbrushes. If a child uses another child's toothbrush or if two toothbrushes come in contact, throw them away and give the children new toothbrushes. If a child uses the toothbrush of another child who is known to be ill or to have a chronic bloodborne infection (such as hepatitis B and C or HIV), parents of the child who used the ill child's brush should be notified. Replace toothbrushes every three to four months or sooner if bristles have lost their tone. 1.32 California Childcare Health ProgramTIPS FOR PREVENTING DENTAL DECAY (CAVITIES, CARIES) Cleaning teeth and gums is the single most important way to prevent dental and gum disease. Good nutrition, which is good for the body, is also good for the mouth. The most harmful foods are those containing sugar and refined carbohydrates. Regular dental visits will ensure early detection and correction of oral/dental problems. If not previously referred by a health care provider, children should get regular dental checkups starting when they get their first tooth, usually by their first birthday. Use of fluoride reduces tooth decay. Research shows that fluoride reduces cavities by up to 25 percent in children and adults. Toothpaste and drinking water may have fluoride. Children between 6 months and 16 years of age living in non-fluoridated areas may have fluoride prescribed by a dentist or health care provider. Use of sealants (plastic coatings applied to teeth by a dental professional) will help prevent tooth decay by creating a physical barrier between the teeth and plaque and food. Since permanent molars are the most at risk for decay, the six-year and 12-year molars need sealants. Avoid frequent exposure to sugary liquids such as milk (including breast milk) fruit juice and other sweet liquids to help prevent baby bottle tooth decay. Learn how to handle dental emergencies: You can help a child avoid losing a tooth. Help parents find a dental provider in their area. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.33POSTER California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.edu Rev. 06/2018TOOTHBRUSHINGSTOP DENTAL DISEASE Use a soft bristled, child-sized toothbrush Use fluoride toothpaste Infants and toddlers: grain of rice-size amount Preschoolers: pea-size amount Do not share the toothpaste tube Dole out toothpaste on a sheet of disposable wax paper or along the edges of a paper plate. Have each child \"pick up\" a bit of toothpaste with toothbrush (one dab per child) or Give each child a small paper cup with a dab of toothpaste along the rim, and use the cup for rinsing after brushing. Brush all tooth surfaces gently and thoroughly Use a side to side motion. Brush along the edge of the gum, at the base of the teeth, where plaque can build up. Assist child to Rinse with water. Spit into the sink (or cup if there is no sink). Children need supervision and assistance brushing their teeth until at least age 8. 1.34 California Childcare Health ProgramACTIVE OUTDOOR PLAY Studies show that regular physical activity helps children be fi t and healthy, improves self-esteem, and decreases the risk of serious illnesses such as heart disease and stroke later in life. Active outdoor play enhances children's senses of smell, touch and taste, and the sense of motion through space, which are powerful ways of learning. Children's perceptual abilities may suffer when they experience the world mainly through television, computers and books. Their social abilities to cooperate, help, share and solve problems with other children are fostered when playing together outdoors. And when they have access to the outdoors, they gain the ability to navigate their immediate environment safely, and lay the foundation for the courage that will enable them eventually to lead their own lives. Ideas for Active Play Infants count on you to set up a safe space away from more mobile children where they can explore with their senses, practice using their muscles and move freely. A large blanket on the fl oor with some colorful toys or objects of different sizes, shapes, and textures will keep them active and interested. Try to take infants outdoors each day, even for a short walk in the yard. Toddlers explore and learn about the world through unstructured play time. Running, climbing, and playing in a sandbox are all fun and offer opportunities to develop and practice new skills. You can lead movement activities such as jumping with two feet, skipping, and running. Explore the crunchy leaves, bare tree limbs, and what can fl oat in puddles. Preschool-age children can enjoy simple games, such as Simon Says. They can roll large balls, play catch and ride wheel toys, dance, sing, or move to music. Unstructured time allows them to learn important skills, use their imaginations, and offers time to wind down. Gardening or simple science activities can encourage their enjoyment of the outdoors while using all their senses. School-age children are ready for new learning experiences and both team and individual sports. Children who prefer not to participate in organized Open Space and Indoor Air Quality teams need regular exercise, such as running, walking, skating, bicycling, dance, and nonviolent martial arts. Children with chronic health conditions and disabilities should be included in outdoor play activities; they receive the same positive bene fits from exercise and exploration. Some activities may need to be modi fied or adapted. Outdoor Play in Winter Winter brings many wonderful opportunities for children to delight in seasonal changes while playing outdoors. But all too often cold or rainy days mean that many young children spend their day indoors engaged in quiet activities. Keep the following in mind: Playing outdoors in cold weather doesn't cause colds \u2014 germs do. Playing outdoors will reduce the amount of time children and adults are exposed to germs while cooped up inside. Dress in layers and keep extra dry clothing for children who get wet or muddy. Open a window and let in the fresh air periodically. Overheated rooms with stale, dry air can be a health hazard. Change your furnace and air fi lters regularly and watch for mold. Use sunscreen to prevent sunburn and decrease the risk of developing skin cancer at a later age whenever your child is playing outdoors. Unless it's actually raining, sun damage can occur whether it's sunny or cloudy. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against trampoline use due to the high number of injuries. Prevent slips and falls by wiping down wet outdoor equipment. Check for adequate cushioning under climbing equipment, as sand and bark may compact when wet. Never let toddlers play around water without constant supervision. It takes very little time and only a few inches of water for a puddle to become a drowning hazard. And remember \u2014 have fun outdoors with your children. Even when the weather is less than perfect, it's good for you too! Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.35INDOOR AIR QUALITY When we think of air pollution, it is important to consider the air that is inside of our homes, workplaces, and other buildings. The Environmental Protection Agency has found that indoor air is two to five times more polluted than outdoor air, and considers contaminants in indoor air among the top five environmental risks to public health. Indoor air contaminants may have adverse effects on the health and comfort of infants, toddlers, preschoolers and the staff who care for them. Many health problems can be triggered by polluted air. Young Children and Indoor Air Pollution Young children are especially vulnerable to indoor air pollution. The same concentrations of pollutants can result in higher exposures to children because they breathe more air in proportion to their body weight than adults. Also, since children are growing and developing, the potential for damage to their respiratory and neurological systems is greater. What Are the Health Risks? Some short-term health problems that may result from indoor air pollutants are headache, nausea, dizziness, infection and irritation of the eyes, nose and respiratory tract. Possible chronic and long-term effects include asthma, allergies, lung disease, cancer, and neurological damage. Causes of Indoor Air Pollution: Biological contaminants such as mold, dust mites, pet dander and cat saliva, pollen, rats and mice, cockroaches, bacteria and viruses Gas stoves, wood stoves and kerosene heaters Solvents, cleaning agents, air fresheners, cosmetics and perfumes Dust from lead paint Off-gassing of chemicals found in furnishings and consumer products such as carpeting and upholstery, wood fi nishes, rug and oven cleaners, paints and lacquers Art supplies such as glues, paints, dry erase markers and pens Pesticides Radon Tobacco smoke and second-hand smokeHow Can We Reduce Indoor Air Pollution? Remove the source of the pollutant. Source control is the most effective, economical and time- efficient way to address indoor air quality. Control moisture in the environment. Moist vapor, standing water and water-damaged materials are a breeding ground for mold, mildew, insects and bacteria. Prompt attention to moisture problems is essential to reduce the risk of adding contaminants into the air. Provide ventilation. Ventilation means supplying outdoor air to the areas that are occupied by children indoors. Opening windows and safely using fans will provide ventilation. Windows should open no more than four inches and fans should not be accessible to children. When windows cannot be opened, rooms should be ventilated by a system that circulates air from outdoors. State laws set standards for the amount of fresh air that should enter the building during operation of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HV AC). HV AC systems should be inspected to ensure that the vents that allow mixing of outdoor air are open. Failure to open the vents is common and results in unsafe indoor environments. Maintain and inspect heating and air conditioning systems. Never burn charcoal indoors. Fireplaces, furnaces, gas heaters, air conditioners and ventilation systems need to be clean, dry and in good repair. Filters should be changed regularly. Make sure that vents in HV AC systems are open. Review custodial and housekeeping practices. Vacuum and damp mop for dust which may contain lead, dust mites, pesticides and other contaminants. Use proper dilutions for cleaning products and use products only for their intended purpose. Read labels and buy the least harmful product available. Products labeled \"warning\" or \"caution\" are less harmful than those labeled \"poison\" or \"danger.\" Choose cleaning products with fewer fumes such as baking soda and vinegar. Avoid products in aerosol sprays. Don't use air fresheners \u2014 they do not improve air quality and use arti ficial chemicals. 1.36 California Childcare Health ProgramEquip craft areas properly. Use art supplies such as glues and paints outside or in ventilated areas. Do not use materials that create toxic fumes or gases. Read the labels, as they are required to identify hazardous ingredients. Don't store open, unused paints and craft materials. Supervise children closely. Use pesticides only as a last resort. Use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) rather than spraying pesticides (for more information see IPM Toolkit for Early Care and Education Programs). Consult a specialist who is familiar with IPM. What Are Useful Policies for Promoting Indoor Air Quality? Written policies show you are committed to providing a healthy child care setting and help avoid confusion when communicating with parents and staff. Communication about environmental issues is essential between caregivers, parents, grounds keepers, custodial staff and maintenance contractors. Policies may address: Painting, renovations and repair. Schedule these activities for times when children are not present. Test all painted surfaces for lead before painting. Choose licensed professionals with experience in dealing with lead paint and proper disposal of debris. Volunteers, although well meaning, are often not aware of the environmental risks to young children. No smoking. This includes all adults. Adults who live in the home of a family child care program as well as parents, relatives and staff should be aware of this policy. Pest management. Use IPM techniques. Ventilation. Arrange your space to provide adequate ventilation to high-need areas such as arts and crafts areas and diaper changing areas. Install window guards for safety. Regularly inspect and maintain HV AC systems. School supplies and purchasing choices. Purchase least toxic supplies. Install new products such as carpeting and furniture when children are not present, and provide ventilation for 48 to 72 hours after installation. (AAP , 2011) Choose low emission products.Sanitizing and cleaning products. Decide what products you will use for cleaning and sanitizing. Keep products in their original containers. Keep all chemicals out of the reach of children. Pets. Determine if you will allow pets in your program. Con fine pets to a limited area that is easily cleaned. Are Air Puri fiers Helpful? Many products are sold as air puri fiers. Ozone generators purposely introduce ozone into the air. Ion generators may introduce ozone into the air as a byproduct. Ozone can be harmful to children, so these devices are not recommended. Air filtration systems, if properly maintained, can be used as an adjunct to source control and adequate ventilation. Effective control at the source of pollution remains the most important step in maintaining air quality. (AAP , 2011) Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.37National Health and Safety Performance Standards in Caring for Our Children recommend that every child care setting be supplied with piped running water under pressure, from a source approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and/or the state or local health authority. The water should be sufficient in quantity and pressure to supply water for cooking, cleaning, drinking, toilets and outside uses. If a child care setting in California is using water from a private source, child care licensing regulations require that they provide evidence of an on-site inspection of the source of the water and a laboratory report showing the safety of the water. Testing of water must be conducted by the local health department, the State Department of Health Services or a licensed commercial laboratory. Any facility not served by a public water supply shall keep documentation of approval of the water supply on file. Drinking Water Must Be Safe for Consumption Exposure to toxic levels of lead can cause problems with learning, behavior, and growth. Testing your water is the only way to be sure that tap water is free from lead. Beginning in 2021, licensed child care programs in places built before 2010 will be required to have their tap water tested for lead. The Availability of Running Water for Hand Washing Is Important Use soap and running water for hand washing. When plumbing is not available to provide a hand washing sink, the child care facility should provide an approved hand washing sink using a portable water supply that flows by gravity or pumping action during use. Children must not wash in a communal basin or stoppered sink because those who wash in the same water share contamination.Water Supply HOW TO FIND OUT IF YOUR DRINKING WATER IS SAFE Drinking water is essential for children's health. According to the Healthy Beverages in Child Care Act (AB 2084), all licensed child care programs in California are required to have clean, safe, and accessible water readily available for children to drink throughout the day. Also, as of October 2017 , all licensed child care centers in California and any family child care homes participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) must offer water to children throughout the day. What is done to ensure that drinking water is safe? Tap water in the United States is generally safe. The Safe Drinking Water Act is a federal law that requires public water companies to test water regularly and meet strict federal standards. Water quality standards in California are even more rigorous than federal standards. Testing for water quality is done annually, and the results are sent to every customer in a Consumer Confidence Report (CCR). You can check the website of your local public water system for a current CCR. How does tap water get to the faucet? In most California communities, drinking water comes from a public water system where the water is collected, stored, tested for contaminants, and treated. The water then travels through large pipes (mains). Service lines (laterals) carry water from the mains to the building. Plumbing pipes carry water to the faucets (taps) inside the building. 1.38 California Childcare Health ProgramWhat if I get my water from a privately- owned water source? Some child care providers get their water from ground-water wells, springs, or surface water instead of a public water system. California Community Care Licensing (CCL) regulations require an on-site inspection of privately-owned water sources and a laboratory report that shows the water is safe to drink. Contact your local public health department, the California Department of Public Health, or a licensed commercial laboratory for information about testing your water. Contact your regional child care licensing office for more information about child care regulations: https:/ /www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/ CCLD/Community Care Licensing Division Child Care Offices.pdf How can water get contaminated? Water can be contaminated at its source (for example, in reservoirs, groundwater, and rivers). However, public water systems treat this water to make it safe to drink. Water treatment includes removing contaminants and making the water less corrosive to pipes. When water leaves a public water system it is considered safe. Water can be contaminated after it leaves the public water system. As water flows through older plumbing, small pieces of lead can flake off of pipes and lead can leach into the water. Also, water standing in pipes or fixtures with lead solder can absorb lead. Homes and buildings built before 1986 are more likely to have pipes, solder, or fixtures that contain lead. What are the health risks of drinking contaminated water? Regular exposure to contaminants can cause serious illnesses and developmental problems in children. For example, lead can cause children to have lower IQ scores, learning disabilities, and difficulty paying attention. There is no known level of lead exposure that is considered safe, especially for children under age 6. Fortunately, you can test a water sample to find out if it has lead. How can I get my water tested? Most likely your water is safe to drink. However, if you are concerned about the safety of the drinking water in your building, a certified laboratory can test the water from individual faucets. The laboratory will either mail you supplies to collect water samples or send a technician to collect samples. Local public health departments, CACFP , or other advocacy groups may provide low-cost or free water testing for families and child care providers with financial need. To find out more about testing your water: Contact your local public water system, or Call the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 800-426-4791, or for a list of Certified Laboratories visit: www.epa.gov/dwlabcert/ contact-information-certification-programs-and- certified-laboratories-drinking-water What else can I do if I'm not sure the water from my tap is safe? Use only cold tap water from your faucet. Hot water dissolves lead from pipes more quickly. Generally, it is safer to use only cold tap water for drinking, cooking, and mixing infant formula. Clean your faucet screens and aerators which can collect particles and debris. If you haven't run the water for six hours, flush the faucets used for cooking or drinking by running the water for 30 seconds. Flush for up to two minutes (or until the water feels cooler) if the building is large or if the water has been sitting in the pipes for days or weeks. Water used to flush pipes can be collected and used for other purposes, such as watering non-edible plants and lawns. Consider using a water filter. Filters that are certified for National Safety Foundation (NSF) American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard 53 remove lead and copper from drinking water. Always check product information labeling, and change filters according to the manufacturer's instructions. What about drinking bottled water instead of tap water? If your tap water is safe, there is no reason to buy bottled water. In fact, there are fewer regulations for testing bottled water than tap water. Many resources go into producing and transporting bottled water. After the water is consumed, even more resources are used in the recycling and disposal process. These activities can harm our environment. In addition, most bottled water does not contain fluoride. Fluoride reduces the risk of tooth decay (cavities). Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.39What about water filters? Most people do not need to filter their tap water. However, water filters can be used to make water taste better or remove contaminants. Many devices for filtering water are available to consumers including: filter pitchers, small faucet-mounted filters, and \"whole-house\" filter systems. If your water is safe but you simply prefer the taste of filtered water, filter pitchers or faucet-mounted filters may be used. Some filters remove fluoride and other minerals such as calcium and magnesium. If you need to filter out contaminants, use a device that is certified by NSF. Not all water filters remove lead. (NSF certified product listings with information about specific contaminants can be found at http:/ /info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_ leadreduction.asp?ProductFunction=053|Lead+Red uction&ProductFunction=058|Lead+Reduction&Pro ductTy pe ) What about water vending machines? Some consumers use water vending machines to fill their own containers. A water vending machine dispenses tap water with some extra filtering. These machines may become contaminated if they are not properly maintained and inspected. Water from water vending machines may not contain fluoride. What do I do if my tap water is contaminated? Do not use contaminated water for drinking, cooking, making formula, or making ice. Instead, use bottled water until you have a reliable filtering system or the underlying problem is fixed (for example, lead free plumbing is installed). If you participate in CACFP , bottled water or filtering equipment may be allowable costs, but be sure to get approval from your CACFP sponsor or California Department of Education nutrition consultant before making any purchases. If you find your water contains lead, notify the families of the children you care for so that their blood lead levels can be tested. Your local public health department can assist with testing children for lead.References and Resources California Department of Social Services (CDSS). Community Care Licensing.

Pets can be excellent companions and meet the emotional needs of children and others for love and affection. Caring for pets also gives children an opportunity to learn how to treat and be responsible for others. However, since animals can pass on disease to people, some guidelines for protecting the health and safety of the children should be followed. All pets, whether kept indoors or outside, should be in good health, show no evidence of disease, and be friendly toward children. Dogs or cats should be appropriately immunized (check with a veterinarian) and be kept on flea, tick and worm control programs. Proof of immunizations should be kept in a safe place. Pet living quarters should be kept clean. All pet waste should be disposed of immediately. Litter boxes should never be accessible to children. Child care providers should always be present when children play with pets. Children should be taught how to behave around a pet. They should be taught not to provoke the pet or remove the pet's food. They should always keep their faces away from a pet's mouth, beak, or claws. If you have a pet in your child care setting, tell parents before they enroll their child. Some children have allergies that may require the parents to find other child care arrangements. Children and providers should wash their hands after handling pets or pet items. All reptiles carry salmonella. Therefore, small reptiles that might be handled by children, including turtles and iguanas, can easily transmit salmonella to them. Iguanas and turtles are not appropriate pets for child care settings. Some pets, particularly \"exotic\" pets such as some turtles, iguanas, venomous or aggressive snakes, spiders and tropical fish, may not be appropriate in the child care setting. Check with a veterinarian if you are unsure whether a particular pet is appropriate for children. Check with the local health department for regulations and advice regarding pets in the child care setting.Pets, Pests, Pesticides, and Integrated Pest Mana gement Keep children's play areas free of animal wastes, insects, rodents or other pest infestations. Do not let pets use play areas for shelter. Keeping Children Safe from Pests and Pesticides California State Licensing regulations for child care state that child care settings should take measures to be free from rats and insects. The national standards in Caring for our Children tell us that the potential health hazards to children caused by the presence of pests should be reduced. What does this mean to the child care provider? Since pesticides can also pose a health threat to young children, finding ways to reduce or eliminate exposure to pests while reducing or eliminating exposure to pesticides is an environmental concern that every early care and education professional needs to address. WHY CONTROL PESTS IN CHILD CARE? Diseases that are spread by insects and rodents can be passed to young children. Normal behaviors in young children such as crawling, mouthing toys and other objects along with natural curiosity and exploration make toddlers particularly vulnerable to diseases carried by pests. Common pest-related hazards in child care settings include: Flies and cockroaches may spread disease. Mosquitoes may carry disease. Cockroaches can cause allergies and asthma attacks. Yellow jacket stings are painful and can be life threatening to those with allergies. Spiders may inflict painful bites and some may pose a health risk. Mice and rats may contaminate food, trigger asthma attacks, carry disease and cause structural damage to buildings, pipes and electrical wiring. Termites cause structural damage to buildings and wood furniture. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.41Why are Children Vulnerable to Pesticide Exposure? The behaviors that make young children vulnerable to diseases carried by pests (crawling, mouthing toys, etc.) can also expose children to the pesticides that have been applied to control pests. Pound for pound, children eat, drink and breathe more than adults. Thus, if pesticides are in their environment, they can have higher exposures than adults. Combined with the fact that their brains, immune systems and organs are immature and still developing, children can suffer both short-term and long-term health problems from pesticide exposure. What Health Risks are Associated with Pesticide Use? With the exception of poison baits, as little as 1 percent of pesticides applied indoors reach the targeted pest (AAP , 2003). As a result, pesticide residues are left on surfaces and in the air of the treated building. Outdoor application of pesticides may fall on non-targeted organisms, outdoor furniture and play areas and be tracked indoors. Acute symptoms such as nausea, headache, dizziness and respiratory irritation may occur from exposure to pesticides. Studies have shown that children who are exposed to pesticides also have a higher incidence of chronic health problems such as neurological disorders, leukemia and other cancers and have a greater risk of developing asthma (IPM Institute, 2004). Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a pest control program that minimizes pesticide exposure. Despite the convenience and availability of pesticides, there are many ways to control pests without the use of chemicals. IPM controls pests by combining biological, mechanical, cultural, physical and chemical methods in a way that minimizes health and environmental risks. IPM provides the least toxic alternative. It is based on inspection and knowledge of the pests' biology and habits to determine the methods that would best control the pests with the lowest possible exposure to pesticides. Chemicals are only used as a last resort. IPM is endorsed and promoted by the Environmental Protection Agency.Why Are Education and Communication Important? The common sense strategies of IPM require the combined efforts of teachers, kitchen staff, parents, custodians and groundskeepers. Education and communication are essential to promote the necessary changes in habits and attitudes. A licensed IPM professional can suggest the best strategies for controlling pests in your child care setting. Cultural controls and sanitation. Modify the activities in the child care facility to make the environment less hospitable to pests. Restrict food consumption to certain areas. Empty trash cans at the end of the day rather than letting them sit over night. Store food in containers with tightly fitting lids. Clean dishes, utensils, and surfaces soiled with food as soon as possible after use and at the end of each day. Clean garbage cans and dumpsters regularly. Collect and dispose of litter daily. Physical controls. Use barriers or other materials to exclude pests from an area. Caulk cracks and openings. Fill in access holes in walls. Seal around electrical outlets. Use trash cans with tightly fitting lids. Empty and thoroughly clean cubbies and storage areas at least twice a year. Reduce clutter in which pests can hide. Keep vegetation, shrubs and wood mulch at least one foot away from structures. Keep window and door screens in good repair. Use physical traps. Be aware that in the child care setting, traps can be a hazard and must be placed out of reach of children. This includes sticky traps, snap traps and fly traps. 1.42 California Childcare Health ProgramBiological controls. Identify the problem or pest before taking action. Look for the root of the problem, not just the symptoms of a pest problem. Inspect and monitor pest populations. It is very important to reduce pests' access to food, water and shelter. Chemical controls. As a last resort, the careful use of pesticides may be necessary. Always use a licensed professional with experience in IPM when applying chemicals. Use bait, traps or gels in cracks, wall voids, and in spots that are out of reach of children. Avoid sprays, powders and \"bomb\" applicators. Schedule pesticide application for times when the building and grounds are not occupied. Use spot treatments as needed, rather than area-wide applications or regularly scheduled applications. Store all chemicals in a locked cabinet. Attitude Adjustment Increase your tolerance for pests that are just a nuisance and don't spread disease. To control these pests, always make use of non-chemical strategies first. Pests that do not pose immediate health threats but are a nuisance include: Weeds may invade playing fields or playgrounds or be aesthetically unpleasing. Pull by hand. Ants may gather in eating and play areas. Keep areas clean. Use non-toxic alternatives. Fruit flies may appear in kitchens. Keep food and garbage covered. Meal moths may infest food storage. Dispose of infested food. Store food in containers with tightly fitting lids. Head lice may appear on children. Have parents consult their health care provider for treatment.HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACT OF 2000 EXTENDED TO CHILD CARE The Healthy Schools Act of 2000 is a California state law that: established the right of parents and school staff to know when pesticides are used in California public schools mandated using least toxic pest management methods in schools as state policy required school districts to designate an integrated pest management (IPM) coordinator required the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) to collect pesticide use information from schools and support schools in their use of IPM The Healthy Schools Act is Extended to Child Care In the 2007 California Law AB 2865, the Healthy Schools Act was extended to child care centers. This extension of the Healthy Schools Act ensures that parents and staff in child care centers are notified of pesticide use and it promotes safer pest prevention practices in child care centers. The Healthy Schools Act helps parents and ECE staff be better informed about what pesticides are being used in their ECE centers and helps ECE providers prevent pest infestations and use safer ways to control pests when they do become a problem. The Healthy Schools Act only applies to child care centers, not family child care homes. The law was prompted by concern about the health risks that pesticides pose to young children. Research suggests that pesticides are commonly found in child care environments. These pesticides may have toxic effects on the developing brain and nervous system of a young child. They are also associated with an increased risk of developing asthma and cancer. Acute pesticide poisoning can cause breathing difficulties, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and dizziness. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.43What Is a Pesticide? A pesticide is any substance that controls, destroys, repels, or attracts a pest. Some common pesticides include: Insecticides (kill insects like ants and mosquitoes), Insect repellants (a substance applied to skin or clothing which discourages insects from landing or climbing on that surface) Miticides (kill mites, for example, dust mites that can cause asthma and eczema) Herbicides (kill unwanted plants/weeds) Fumigants (gaseous pesticides that fill a space and poison the pests within; for example, fleas) Rodenticides (chemicals intended to kill rodents) Avicides (substances used to kill birds) Antimicrobials (substances such as sanitizers and disinfectants that kill bacteria and viruses) Algicides (kill and prevent the growth of algae)The Healthy Schools Act (HSA) regulates the use of pesticides on school sites an in child care centers including buildings or structures, playgrounds, vehicles, or any other area of the property visited or used by children. The California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) is responsible for helping schools and child care centers implement the Healthy Schools Act. DPR's website has many helpful resources. Visit the website at https:/ /apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/ Who Needs Training on the Healthy Schools Act? Anyone who applies pesticides in child care centers, including HSA exempt pesticides* such as antimicrobials and disinfectants, must complete annual Healthy Schools Act training. Online training is available at no charge on the DPR website. *Some pesticides, such as antimicrobials and bait stations, are exempt from the Posting, Notification, and Record Keeping Requirements of the Healthy Schools Act. For more information on exempt pesticides, visit the DPR website. 1.44 California Childcare Health ProgramPOSTER Healthy Schools Act Requirements for Public K-12 Schools and Child Care Centers PesticideWARNING!IPMIDENTIFY Choose an IPM coordinator who will make sure the requirements of the HSA are met. [SCCIPM 08 (05/2019)]TRAIN Provide annual Healthy Schools Act training to all teachers, staff, and volunteers who use any pesticides, including exempt pesticides. NOTIFY Send an annual notification to all parents, guardians, and staff of all pesticides expected to be applied during the year. REGISTER Give parents, guardians, and staff the opportunity to register to be notified 72 hours in advance of individual pesticide applications.PLAN Create a plan for IPM and publish it on the school, district, or child care center website. If a website does not exist, include the plan in the annual written notification. POST Post warning signs in the area where a pesticide will be applied, at least 24 hours before and 72 hours after the application. RECORD Keep records of pesticide applications, and file these records for at least 4 years. REPORT Submit annual pesticide use reports to DPR by January 30 for the previous year's applications. Only report pesticide use by school personnel. Visit our website: http://apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/ Questions? Email us at: school-ipm@cdpr.ca.gov Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.45Keeping Sandbox and Sand Play Areas Safe Children love and learn from the freedom and creativity involved in sand play area activities. Yet an uncovered sandbox is an invitation for cats or other animals to defecate or urinate, and therefore is a source of disease transmission. To prevent contamination and transmission of disease from animal feces in the sandbox, make sure they are safe by following these guidelines: Separate the sandbox from other play equipment such as slides or swings. Keep the sandbox covered when not in use. Fasten the cover to prevent children or animals and pests from getting under it. Make sure the sandbox has adequate drainage so water does not puddle or pool. Use smooth-surfaced, fine pea gravel or washed sand that is labeled for sandboxes. Sand that is used as building material or collected from a site containing toxic materials may be harmful.Sandboxes and Sand Play Areas If you see or smell urine, feces, pests, or other hazards in the sand, replace the sand with fresh sand. Treatment of sand with chemicals to attempt to disinfect it within the sandbox is not recommended. Before each use, make sure sand play areas are free of pests and other dangers like sharp objects and cat and other animal feces. Keep the play area clear of food, garbage, and standing water because these attract pests. Replace sand as often as necessary to keep the sand clean of pests, feces, and other hazards. Place sandboxes away from prevailing winds. If this is not possible, provide windbreaks using bushes, trees, or fences. Keep surrounding pavement free of sand. Sweep pavement regularly to reduce the risk of sliding and slipping. 1.46 California Childcare Health ProgramPOSTER INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT: CARING FOR YOUR OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT Sandboxes } Separate the sandbox from other play equipment such as slides or swings. } Make sure the sandbox has adequate drainage so water does not puddle or pool. } Use smooth-surfaced, fine pea gravel or washed sand that's labeled for sandboxes. Do not use sand that's used as construction material or collected from a site that uses harmful materials. } When not in use, keep the sandbox covered with a lid or other covering that keeps pests out. PESTS IN THE SANDBOX } Don' t use sprays or foggers in the sandbox. These are dangerous for children and don't kill pests hiding in the sand. } Avoid using chemicals to clean or disinfect the sandbox. } If you see or smell urine, feces, pests, or other hazards, replace the sand with fresh sand or fresh fine pea gravel. PREVENT FUTURE PEST PROBLEMS } Before each use, make sure sand play areas are free of pests and other dangers like sharp objects, cat, and other animal feces. } Keep the play area clear of food, garbage, and standing water because these attract pests. } Replace sand as often as necessary to keep the sand clean and free of pests, feces, and other hazards.Garbage and Recycling } Use the outdoor waste bins provided by your local waste hauler. Request more bins if your garbage or recycling regularly overflows. } Set bins at least 50 feet away from entrances to home or play yard and keep on pest-proof pavement such as concrete. } Keep the bin area free from spilled liquids or waste. } Make sure that every outdoor waste bin has a tight-fitting lid. } Rinse your recycling and bins regularly . } Regularly rinse green waste bins for food scraps and yard trimmings that are collected by your waste hauler. ON-SITE COMPOSTING Composting provides a wonderful opportunity to teach children about environmental sustainability. Unfortunately, compost left in the open can attract unwanted pests. Instead, choose a closed compost bin. } Closed compost systems make it more difficult for pests to access the contents and have fewer odors. } They often come with handles that make turning the compost easy, even for children. } As with waste bins, set the closed compost bin system on a pest-proof surface such as concrete. PESTS IN GARBAGE AREA } If you use rodent bait stations or yellowjacket traps, make sure they're placed out of children's reach. \u00a9 2016 UCSF California Childcare Health Program Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.47Health policies are important because they provide specific guidelines to promote health and safety in child care programs. Policies should include specific guidelines required by licensing or regulations, best practices and information specific to your setting. All policies need to be discussed with parents when they enroll their child and with staff as part of their orientation. Which Written Policies Are Recommended? The Caring for Our Children National Health and Safety Performances Standards , Guidelines for Early Care and Education, recommends that you establish written policies. Some of these policies include: Health History Emergency Information Immunization Policy (children and staff) Exclusion for Illness Reporting Requirements Emergency Illness or Injury Procedures Children with Special Needs Medication Administration Nutrition/Foods Brought from Home No Smoking or Use of Alcohol or Illegal Drugs Other Topics for Policies Include: Injury Prevention Managing Injuries and First Aid Emergency Preparedness Child Abuse/Neglect Transportation Safe Infant Sleep Dental HealthSome policies may not be needed in a family child care home setting where fewer children are in care or in centers that do not care for infants and toddlers. An electronic copy of Model Child Care Health Policies is available on the ECELS webpage of the Pennsylvania Chapter of American Academy of Pediatrics. www.ecels-healthychildcarepa.org/ For a direct link to Model Child Care Health Policies 5th edition: www.ecels-healthychildcarepa.org/ publications/manuals-pamphlets-policies/item/248- model-child-care-health-policies In developing policies, you should make sure that you: Have the equipment, supplies and staff necessary to make the policies work. Organize the child care program to support the policies. Use proper procedures to support the policies. Keep lines of communication open with everyone involved: staff members, parents and children. Assure that all staff, parents and others are educated regarding the policies. Have a list of resources to assist families and staff in meeting your policies. In developing your policies always ask: What should be done? Why should it be done? Who is responsible? When will it be done? How will it be done? How will it be communicated, enforced, and monitored?Health and Safety PoliciesMODULE 1 / SECTION 3 Policies to Prevent the Spread of Infectious Diseases 1.48 California Childcare Health ProgramTo prevent the spread of contagious diseases, recommended policies and procedures need to be followed at all times because: People can spread an infection to others before showing any symptoms of illness. People can carry and spread germs without ever getting sick themselves. In a child care setting where people from different families spend many hours together in close physical contact, germs are spread more easily. Clearly Define the Roles of Caregivers The qualifications and requirements for each of these roles are defined by the child care license. Centers which receive subsidies from the Department of Education may have different requirements and centers, infant programs, school age, large and small family child care programs each have different requirements for each role. 1. The Director or Administrator. In large child care facilities the administrator is responsible for overseeing all health services, policies, and procedures in the program. 2. Teaching Staff and Licensed Child Care Providers, and Child Care Assistants. Staff will receive training on the program's health and safety policies and will follow them accordingly. 3. Other Staff. These include food handlers, janitorial staff, maintenance workers, etc. 4. The Child Care Health Consultant. Whenever possible, each child care setting should have access to a child care health consultant (CCHC). Ask your CCHC to assist in developing health policies, approve them, and link you with community health resources. 5. Families. Families will be informed of and follow health and safety policies. Families are responsible for communicating about their child's health even if the child stays home due to illness. Sample Illness Policy POLICY: Children who are mildly ill but do not qualify for exclusion will be accepted for care in the regular program. Children who become ill with excludable symptoms while at the child care program will be cared for away from the group until the child is picked up by an authorized adult. Specialized care plans will be followed. PURPOSE: To insure every child a healthy, safe and supportive experience. To protect the health of everyone in the group. To assist program staff in meeting all children's needs. To protect the rights of the family and child. PROCEDURE: Understand the reason for excluding a child. The illness prevents the child from comfortably participating in daily activities. The illness requires more care than the child care staff are able to provide without compromising the health and safety of the other children. The symptoms or illnesses are any of those specified on the Inclusion/Exclusion Guidelines. Conditions for which you would not automatically exclude a child. Certain conditions, in the absence of symptoms listed on Inclusion/Exclusion Guidelines, do not require exclusion unless recommended by the child's health care provider or if symptoms appear CMV or HIV infection or hepatitis B and C virus carrier state Pink eye Rash without temperature or behavior changes Non-contagious conditions such as chronic medical conditions or disabilities Runny nose without behavior changes and the child can participate in activities The final decision to exclude a child from care is made by the staff of the child care provider Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.49LIC 701 1.50 California Childcare Health ProgramLIC 701 Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.51LIC 702 1.52 California Childcare Health ProgramLIC 627 Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.53LIC 700 1.54 California Childcare Health ProgramYou need to know the health history and emergency information for every child in your care. When a child enrolls in your child care setting, you should find out: Where parents can be reached: full names, addresses and work and home phone numbers. At least two people to contact if parents can't be reached: phone numbers and addresses. The child's regular health care providers: names, addresses and phone numbers. The hospital the child's family uses: name, address and phone number. The date of the child's last physical examination. Any child who has not had a well-baby or well- child examination recently (within the past six months for children under two years of age and within one year for two- to six-year- olds) should be examined within 30 days of entering your child care setting. Any special health problems or medical conditions that a child may have and procedures to follow to deal with these conditions. Examples of conditions needing procedures are allergies, asthma, diabetes, epilepsy and sickle cell anemia. These conditions can cause sudden attacks that may require immediate action. You should know: 1) what happens to the child during a crisis related to the condition; 2) how to prevent a crisis; 3) how to deal with a crisis; and 4) whether you need training in a particular emergency procedure. The child's immunization status. Whether the child has been evaluated with a TB skin test \u2014 only high-risk children in the centers need a skin test.California Title 22 regulations require that each child accepted for care in centers has a written medical assessment. (LIC 701) The medical assessment can inform the child care provider about any necessary health related services the child may need. If special care is needed, the child care provider will create a special health care plan with the family and the health care provider. California Title 22 regulations also require that each child accepted for care has emergency contact information (LIC 700). Emergency contact information should be updated regularly and should include the best way to reach family and back-up emergency contacts in case the family cannot be reached.Health History and Emergency Information Policy Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.55IMMUNIZATION FOR CHILDREN IN CHILD CARE The law requires you to have written proof of each child's up-to-date immunizations. Children attending child care especially need all of the recommended immunizations to protect themselves, the other children, the child care provider and their families. Several diseases that can cause serious problems for children and adults can be prevented by immunization. These diseases are chickenpox, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae, meningitis, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, polio, German measles (rubella), tetanus and whooping cough (pertussis). Parents must present their child's Immunization Record prior to enrollment. Copy the full date (month/day/year) of each shot onto the blue California School Immunization Record card and then determine if the child is up-to-date. Blue cards are available free from the Immunization Coordinator at your local health department. As the child care provider, it is your responsibility to follow up regularly until all shots have been given and recorded.New Immunization Laws Effective in 2016 (SB 277) regarding personal beliefs exemptions: Parents or guardians of students in any school or child-care facility, whether public or private, are not allowed to submit a personal beliefs exemption to a currently-required vaccine. (SB 792) regarding staff immunization requirements: A person may not be employed or volunteer at a child care center or a family child care home unless he or she has been immunized against influenza, pertussis, and measles or qualifies for an exemption. In order to qualify for an exemption, a person must submit one of the following to the child care center or family child care home: a determination by a licensed physician, in writing, that immunization is not safe for them because of their physical condition or medical circumstances; or a determination by a licensed physician, in writing, that they have evidence of current immunity; or in regard to the influenza vaccine only, a signed declaration that the employee has declined the vaccine. A person is also considered exempt from the influenza vaccine requirement if they were hired or began volunteering after December 1 of the previous year or before August 1 of the current year.Immunization Requirements and Policy 1.56 California Childcare Health ProgramAGE WHEN ADMITTED TOTAL NUMBER OF DOSES REQUIRED OF EACH IMMUNIZATION2,3 2 through 3 months 1 Polio 1 DTaP 1 Hep B 1 Hib 4 through 5 months 2 Polio 2 DTaP 2 Hep B 2 Hib 6 through 14 months 2 Polio 3 DTaP 2 Hep B 2 Hib 15 through 17 months 3 Polio 3 DTaP 2 Hep B 1 Varicella On or after the 1st birthday: 1 Hib4 1 MMR 18 months through 5 years 3 Polio 4 DTaP 3 Hep B 1 Varicella On or after the 1st birthday: 1 Hib4 1 MMR CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PRE-KINDERGARTEN (any private or public child care center, day nursery, nursery school, family day care home, or development center) Doses required by age when admitted and at each age checkpoint after entry1: INSTRUCTIONS: California pre-kindergarten (child care or preschool) facilities are required to check immunizations for all new admissions and at each age checkpoint.

To protect yourself and the children in your care, you need to know which immunizations you received as a child and whether you had certain childhood diseases. If you are not sure, your health care provider can test your blood to determine if you are immune to some of these diseases and can vaccinate you against those to which you are not immune. If you are pregnant or may become pregnant, it is important to have protection since some of the vaccine-preventable diseases can harm you and your unborn baby. Tuberculosis (TB) Testing Persons who are beginning work as child care providers are required to have a TB skin test or a TB symptom review by a health care provider to check for infection with the TB. Anyone who has a positive result from the skin test or symptom review should be evaluated promptly by a physician, who will check for active TB. Recommended Immunizations for Child Care Providers Child care providers should have received all immunizations routinely recommended for adults. Licensed child care providers in California are required to show proof of at least one dose of Measles (MMR) and at least one dose of Pertussis, also known as Whooping Cough (Tdap), and receive an annual Influenza vaccination.Influenza (Flu): All child care providers are required to be annually vaccinated against influenza. The law provides for child care providers to opt out of this annual requirement, however, it is good policy for all staff who care for young children to receive this important vaccination. Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR): Providers born before 1957 can be considered immune to measles and mumps. Others can be considered immune if they have a history of measles or mumps disease proven with a blood test, or have received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine on or after their first birthday. Tetanus, Diphtheria, acellular Pertussis (Tdap): Child care providers should have a record of receiving a series of three doses (usually given in childhood) and a booster dose given within the past 10 years. Polio: Child care providers, especially those working with children who are not toilet-trained, should have a record of a primary series of three doses (usually given in childhood) and a supplementary dose given at least six months after the third dose in the primary series. Hepatitis A: Hepatitis A vaccine is not routinely recommended for child care providers but may be indicated if the local health department determines that the risk of hepatitis A in the community is high. Chickenpox: Child care providers who know they have had chickenpox can assume they are immune. All other providers should consider getting vaccinated because of the risk of exposure to chickenpox. Hepatitis B: Child care providers who may have contact with blood or blood-contaminated body fluids (such as bloody noses or cuts), or who work with developmentally disabled or aggressive children, should be vaccinated against hepatitis B with one series of three doses of vaccine. 1.62 California Childcare Health ProgramMAINTAINING RECORDS It is required that child care centers obtain a medical record and a detailed developmental health history for each child in the program. Maintain the file for each child in one central location within the setting. It is recommended that family child care providers also do this, but it is not required in California. All child care providers should become familiar with this information. In addition to obtaining health data for individual children, child care staff must learn how to deal with their specific needs. For instance, asthma is very common in early childhood. If you have a child with asthma in your program, review the history of treatment and current medications. It is important that each provider and staff member know the child's physical history, including allergies. Obtain written permission before any medication is given to a child. In California, the law (AB 221 Blood Glucose Monitoring \u2014 Finger Stick) authorizes blood glucose testing for the purpose of monitoring a child with diabetes. Required documents include written instructions from the child's medical provider on how to conduct the test, how to determine if results are in the acceptable range, any restrictions in activities or diet, how to recognize the signs of low/ high glucose level and any actions to be taken.The medical record on file for each child should include a medical report completed and signed by the child's health care provider, preferably prior to enrollment. The medical report shall include the following medical and developmental information: Records of the child's immunizations A description of any disability, sensory impairment, developmental variation, seizure disorder, or emotional or behavioral disturbance that may affect adaptation to child care An assessment of the child's growth A description of health problems or findings from an examination or screening that need follow-up Results of screenings-vision, hearing, dental, nutrition, developmental, tuberculosis*, hemoglobin, urine, lead, etc. Dates of significant communicable diseases (e.g., chickenpox) Prescribed medication(s), including information on recognizing, documenting, and reporting potential side effects A description of current acute or chronic health problems under or needing treatment A description of past serious injuries that required medical attention or hospitalization A special health care plan with specific instructions for the caregiver. Keep an up-to-date special health care plan for each individual child with a special health care need on file. *The skin test for tuberculosis (Mantoux) is not required for children unless the child's medical provider concludes that they are at risk for TB.Keeping Health Records Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.63MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY IN CHILD CARE SETTINGS What is con fidential information? Con fidential information is personal details from our lives which we may not want to share with others. It can include our address, phone number, birth date, employment history or other personal information. It may also include information about our past or present health and development. Individuals have the right to keep information of this type private. Child care programs routinely handle con fidential information about enrolled children, families and staff. When managing sensitive information, it is important for child care directors, administrators and staff to be aware of their ethical and legal responsibility to protect the privacy of individuals and families. Legal Requirements California Community Care Licensing (CCL) Regulations for Child Care Centers require that licensed providers ensure the con fidentiality of all records pertaining to enrolled children. Files containing con fidential information should be accessible only to program staff who must know the information in order to care for the children. Each child's records must also be made available to that individual child's parent/guardian, CCL personnel, or police of ficers upon request. CCL further requires that programs must inform the parents/guardians of enrolled children that their information will be kept con fidential. Programs must explain to enrolled families that their records will be shared only as described above, unless the family gives the program written consent to disclose speci fic information to others.Confidential Contents of Records in Child Care Settings Programs keep individual fi les for each enrolled child, including but not limited to the following: Enrollment forms Family's health insurance information Health screenings and records, including immunization records Emergency contact information Contact information for those authorized to pick up child Emergency care consent forms Consent forms (permission slips) for outings or special activities Names of regular medical or dental providers who know the child Nutritional restrictions Progress reports Child observation logs Parent conference logs Medication logs Documentation of medical, behavioral or developmental evaluations, referrals or follow- ups, addressing issues relevant to the child's participation in the program Documentation of any injury occurring at the program site and the steps taken to address the situation 1.64 California Childcare Health ProgramHow Can Child Care Programs Ensure Confidentiality? Caring for Our Children, National Health and Safety Performance Standards recommends that programs create and abide by a written policy which describes how con fidential information should be documented, stored and handled. All staff should be familiar with this policy, which should cover all of the speci fic types of con fidential information kept at the program site. Below are some examples of how a program can protect con fidential information while providing quality care. Notification of communicable illnesses. When any child in care is diagnosed with a communicable illness or condition, such as chicken pox, impetigo, head lice and many others, programs should notify the program staff and the families of any children who may have been exposed. Noti fied families should be instructed to monitor their own children for the development of any symptoms, and to seek medical attention if symptoms do occur. This type of noti fication can and should be done without mentioning the identity of the diagnosed child. Children with special needs. Enrolled children may have special needs due to disabilities or chronic health conditions. To ensure their safety, programs often institute policies that have an effect on all of the families in the program. A common example of such a policy is one that prohibits families from bringing some types of food to the program site, to accommodate the restricted diet of another child. A program may institute a peanut-free policy, to protect a child with a life-threatening reaction to peanuts. Or, a program may create a policy prohibiting sugar- laden cakes and cookies at birthday celebrations, to accommodate a child with diabetes, for whom such foods are dangerous. When creating such policies and notifying other families, keep the affected child's right to confidentiality in mind. Noti fications of policies should explain that there is a child in the program whose serious health condition makes the policy necessary. The noti fication need not mention the affected child by name.When Is It Appropriate to Disclose Personal Information? While the rights and desires of families to keep their personal details private are important, there are also some circumstances under which identifying information should be shared. Program staff and the \"need to know. \" To ensure the health and safety of children with special needs, teachers, caregivers, and other program staff who interact with the children should be informed of the identities of children with special health concerns on a \"need to know\" basis. For example, staff who prepare and serve food should be fully aware of which children have food allergies and what each affected child is allergic to. Staff members who monitor the children in the playground should be aware if any children are allergic to bee stings, or if any children have a chronic condition which warrants especially close monitoring during play (such as poorly controlled epilepsy, or diabetes treated by insulin injection). Primary caregivers and back-up staff need to know if any children in care have been prescribed medications, for what reasons, and what the possible side effects are, since they are likely to be administering the medications and monitoring the reaction. Program directors and teachers need to know if there are any un- or under-immunized children in care, so that appropriate measures can be taken in the event of exposure to a vaccine-preventable illness. Outbreaks of reportable illness. Community Care Licensing Regulations provide a list of certain serious infectious diseases which are reportable in California. This means that a child care program must report to both the local Public Health Department and to Community Care Licensing whenever there is a known or suspected case or outbreak of any of these illnesses. Outbreaks involving two or more children of any communicable disease not on the list (such as head lice) must also be reported. During such reporting, identifying information about the affected child, including name, age, and how to contact the family, should be reported. Known or suspected child abuse. Licensed child care providers are mandated reporters of child abuse. If a child in your care shows evidence of abuse or neglect, you must call Child Protective Services and report the situation. The CPS intake process requires disclosure of the child's name, address, parents or guardian's names, and possible additional details. In this situation, the child's safety and welfare come Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.65FOUR STEPS TO A HEALTHIER PROGRAM STEP 1. Start the day with a health check. Perform a brief and casual assessment of each child every day upon arrival and before the parent leaves. You are familiar with what is typical for each child and can identify \"red flags.\" Listen to what the child and parent tell you about how the child is feeling. Is the child hoarse, having trouble breathing, or coughing? Did he or she eat breakfast? Look at children from their level. Observe for signs of crankiness, pain, discomfort, or fatigue. Does the child look pale, have a rash, sores, or runny nose or eyes? Feel the child's cheek and neck with the back of your hand for warmth, clamminess, or bumps. Smell for unusual odors in their breath or diaper. STEP 2. Distribute and explain your exclusion policies to parents and staff. Have a clear, up-to-date exclusion policy for illness and provide parents with a copy. Ask your health consultant or a health professional to review it periodically. Writing a sound policy and enforcing it consistently will help reduce conflicts. Make sure all staff persons understand the policies and how to enforce them. Have an orientation for staff and parents and explain your exclusion policy. STEP 3. Understand the reasons for exclusion. The child doesn't feel well enough to participate comfortably in routine activities. The ill child requires more care than staff is able to provide without compromising the health and safety of the other children. The child poses a risk of harmful diseases to others. STEP 4. Notify parents. Inform parents of observed signs or symptoms, and promptly notify all families when a diagnosed communicable condition arises. Post a notice that includes the signs and symptoms to watch for, what to do, and when children with the condition can return.EXCLUDING CHILDREN Conditions for Which Exclusion Is NOT Recommended Certain conditions, by themselves, do not require exclusion unless recommended by the child's health care provider or the public health department. However, the reasons listed in step 3 still apply. Common colds, runny noses (regardless of color or consistency of nasal discharge), and cough. Fever in the absence of any other signs or symptoms of illness. Presence of germs in urine or stool in the absence of symptoms of illness. Exceptions include potentially serious organisms such as E. coli 0157:H7 , shigella or salmonella. Watery eyes with a clear, watery discharge and without fever, eye pain, or eyelid redness. Rash without fever and without behavior changes. Diagnosed CMV infection. Carrier of hepatitis B virus, if they have no behavioral or medical risk factors such as unusually aggressive behavior (biting), oozing rashes or bleeding. HIV infection, provided the child's health, immune status and behavior are appropriate as determined by that child's health care provider. Symptoms or Conditions for Which Exclusion Is Recommended For some conditions, exclusion can significantly reduce the spread of infection or allow children time to recover to the point where you can safely care for them: Fever along with behavior change or other signs of illness such as sore throat, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, earache, etc. Get medical attention when infants younger than 4 months have unexplained fever. In an infant younger than 2 months, a temperature above 100.4\u00b0 F requires immediate medical attention. Symptoms and signs of possible severe illness such as unusual tiredness, uncontrolled coughing or wheezing, continuous crying, difficulty breathing, or severe abdominal pain.Excluding Children Due to Illness 1.66 California Childcare Health ProgramDiarrhea \u2014 runny, watery or bloody stools when the stool cannot be contained in a diaper or is causing accidents in a toilet trained child or the child is having more stools than is typical for that child in a day. Vomiting \u2014 more than two times in the past 24-hour period. Strep throat \u2014 until 24 hours after treatment has been started. Impetigo \u2014 until 24 hours after treatment has started. Mouth sores with drooling \u2014 until evaluated by a health care provider. Scabies \u2014 until 24 hours after treatment is applied. Any child determined by the local health department to be contributing to transmission of illness during an outbreak. For a list of reportable diseases see CCHP Health and Safety Note: Exposure to Communicable Disease. WHAT TO DO WHEN A CHILD BECOMES ILL IN YOUR PROGRAM Attempt to keep the child from intimate contact with other children and staff. Remove and sanitize toys and other items they may have put into their mouth. WASH HANDS! Contact the parents to have the child picked up as soon as possible. Make the child as comfortable as possible. Do not isolate them in such a way that you cannot provide supervision at all times. Continue to observe the child for new or worsening symptoms. If the child does not respond to you, is having trouble breathing, or is having a seizure, call 9-1-1. Document your actions in the child's file with date, time, symptoms, actions taken, by whom, and be sure to add your signature. When to Get Immediate Help Some conditions require immediate medical help. If the parent can be reached, tell them to come right away and to notify their medical provider. Call Emergency Medical services (9-1-1) immediately and also notify parents if any of the following happens: You believe a child needs immediate medical assessment and treatment that cannot wait for parents to take the child for care.A child has a stiff neck (that limits his ability to put his chin to his chest) or severe headache and fever. A child has a seizure for the first time. A child has a fever as well as difficulty breathing. A child looks or acts very ill, or seems to be getting worse quickly. A child's skin or lips look blue, purple or gray. A child is having difficulty breathing or breathes so fast or hard that he or she cannot play, talk, cry or drink. A child is vomiting blood. A child complains of a headache or feeling nauseous, or is less alert or more confused, after a hard blow to the head. Multiple children have injuries or serious illness at the same time. A child has a large volume of blood in the stools. A child has a suddenly spreading blood-red or purple rash. A child acts unusually confused. A child is unresponsive or has decreasing responsiveness. Tell the parent to come right away, and get medical help immediately, when any of the following things happen. If the parent or the child's medical provider is not immediately available, call 9-1-1 (EMS) for immediate help: A fever in any child who appears more than mildly ill. An infant under 2 months of age has an axiliary (\"armpit\") temperature above 100.4\u00ba F. An infant under four months of age has two or more forceful vomiting episodes (not the simple return of swallowed milk or spit-up) after eating. A child has neck pain when the head is moved or touched. A child has a severe stomach ache that causes the child to double up and scream. A child has a stomach ache without vomiting or diarrhea after a recent injury, blow to the abdomen or hard fall. A child has stools that are black or have blood mixed through them. A child has not urinated in more than eight hours, and the mouth and tongue look dry. A child has continuous, clear drainage from the nose after a hard blow to the head. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.67A child has a medical condition outlined in his special care plan as requiring medical attention. A child has an injury that may require medical treatment such as a cut that does not hold together after it is cleaned. EXPOSURE TO COMMUNICABLE DISEASE As a child care provider, you join hands with parents in your efforts to create a healthy environment for children in your care. You and the parents will benefit from the communication of your health and safety policies, health and safety messages and new knowledge gained on health and safety issues. You are also required to inform parents when children in your care are exposed to a communicable disease. The form on the next page will help you prepare a written notice to parents about exposure of their children to a communicable disease. The notice will alert them to watch for signs of that illness and seek medical advice when necessary. Confidentiality Please keep in mind that when notifying parents about exposure, the confidentiality of the ill person should be maintained. You should not report the name of the child, other family member, or staff member who is ill to other parents. Let the parents of an ill child know ahead of time that you will be sending exposure notices to other parents but will not mention any names. Reporting Communicable Diseases to Outside Agencies All licensed child care programs are required to report a case or outbreaks of some communicable diseases to both Community Care Licensing and the local public health department. A list of those diseases which are reportable in California is included on pages 1.77-1.79. An outbreak is defined as two or more known or suspected cases of a disease. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends that child care providers report even if there is only a single case, to ensure that the local Public Health Department is aware that this serious illness is present in a child care setting. Licensed child care providers are also required to report outbreaks of any disease, including diseases not on the list, such as head lice.When you report to licensing and your local health department, the parents of the children must be informed that you are required to report the disease. The children's health care providers are also required to report communicable disease to the health department. We encourage you to work closely with the local health department to reassure and inform parents and staff. The requirement to report communicable diseases to the local health department applies to any licensed facility, whether it is a center or family child care home. However, we strongly encourage unlicensed providers to report communicable diseases as well and work closely with their local health department. Parental Responsibilities Just as child care providers have an obligation to report when children in care are exposed to a communicable disease, parents have the same obligation to report diseases to the child care program within 24 hours of a diagnosis, even if they keep their child at home. That way, the child care provider can alert other parents to watch for signs of that illness in their children and seek medical advice when necessary. Exclusion Policies Distribute and explain your exclusion policies to parents and staff before illness arises. Have a clear, up-to-date exclusion policy for illness and provide parents with a copy when they enroll their child in your program. Ask your health consultant or a health professional to review it periodically. Writing a sound policy and enforcing it consistently will help reduce conflicts. Make sure all staff understand the policies and how to enforce them. Here is an example: The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has issued up-to-date guidance for schools and child care on children with head lice. Community Care Licensing then posted a Provider Information Notice (PIN). https:/ /www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/CCLD/CCP%20 PINs/PIN_19-09-CCP_Head_Lice_Information.pdf Child care providers can use this reliable information when writing policies on caring for children with head lice. 1.68 California Childcare Health ProgramNotice of Exposure to Communicable Disease NAME OF CHILD CARE PROGRAM _____________________________________________________________________ ADDRESS OF CHILD CARE PROGRAM __________________________________________________________________ TELEPHONE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE PROGRAM _______________________________________________________ DATE ___________________ Dear Parent or Legal Guardian: A child in our program has or is suspected of having: _________________________________________________ INFORMATION ABOUT THIS DISEASE The disease is spread by: _________________________________________________________________________ The symptoms are: ______________________________________________________________________________ be prevented by: __________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ What the program is doing to reduce the spread: _____________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ What you can do at home to reduce the spread: ______________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ If your child has any symptoms of this disease, call your health care provider to find out what to do and be sure to tell them about this notice.

The child with a runny nose and stuffiness is a familiar problem in the child care setting. The nose is lined or covered by a delicate tissue called \"mucosa\" which produces mucus (sticky, slippery secretions) to protect the nose. If this tissue is irritated, it swells up, causing blockage and a lot of mucus. Sometimes children get repeated runny noses or permanent sniffles and a green nasal discharge, which are uncomfortable conditions for the child as well as child care provider. What Causes the Runny Nose? THE COMMON COLD is the most typical cause of a runny nose and chronic runny nose. This is generally a mild illness, and the child feels and looks well otherwise. The child usually gets better on his own within a week. The runny nose is usually accompanied by a mild fever. There may also be other symptoms such as headache, sore throat, coughing, sneezing, watery eyes, and fatigue. Children with the common cold usually get better on their own within a week. ALLERGIES can also cause a runny nose. They usually occur after two years of age and after the child has had plenty of exposure to allergens (the substances that can produce allergic reaction in the body). They might occur during a specific season or after a particular exposure \u2014 for example, after being around grass or animals. The child may also have watery and itchy eyes, sneezing, asthma, rubbing of the nose and a lot of clear mucus. With allergies, the runny nose may last for weeks or months, but there is no fever or spread of disease to others. BACTERIAL INFECTION (sinus infection) may occasionally develop and contribute to the continuation of illness. Young children with sinusitis may have some or all of these symptoms: a runny nose lasting for more than 10 to 14 days that may be clear or thick and green or yellow, postnasal drip, foul smelling breath, a daytime cough which may worsen at night, and swelling around the eyes. Remember that yellow or green mucus does not always mean that a child has a bacterial infection. It is normal for the mucus to get thick and change color as the common viral cold progresses.Is Green Mucus More of a Concern than Clear Mucus? Children with clear mucous at the beginning of a cold are most contagious. Green nasal mucus (usually found toward the end of the cold) is less contagious than clear mucus. A runny nose usually starts with clear mucus which then becomes whitish or greenish as the cold dries up and gets better. This happens because as the body mounts its defenses against the virus, the white blood cells enter the mucus and give it the green color. Usually the green mucus is in smaller amounts and thicker, a sign that the cold is \"drying up\" and ending. A child with a green runny nose that lasts for more than 10 to 14 days, and that may be accompanied by fever, headache, cough and foul-smelling breath, might be a sign of sinus infection. The child should have a medical evaluation. When are Children Contagious? The amount of virus present is usually highest two to three days before a person develops symptoms of the illness and continues to be present for two to three days after symptoms begin. As a result, infected children have already spread viruses before they begin to feel ill. If a Person Is Infected, How Is the Infection Spread? Germs may be spread to others by: Wiping a nose and then touching other people and objects before washing hands Sharing of mouthed toys by infants and toddlers; Coughing and sneezing into the air Kissing on the mouth Poor ventilation 1.74 California Childcare Health ProgramHow Can We Limit the Spread of Infection? To prevent the spread of infection from respiratory illnesses and runny noses, follow routine preventive health practices: Avoid contact with mucus as much as possible. Make sure that all children and staff use good hand washing practices, especially after wiping or blowing noses, after contact with any nose, throat or eye secretions, and before preparing or eating food. Do not allow food to be shared. Clean and sanitize all mouthed toys and objects and surfaces used to prepare or eat meals and snacks. Wash eating utensils carefully in soapy water, then sanitize and air dry. Use a dishwasher whenever possible. Use disposable cups if you don't have a dishwasher or equipment and supplies to properly sanitize cups. Make sure that the facility is well ventilated and that children are not crowded together, especially during naps on floor mats or cots. Open the windows and play outside as much as possible, even in the winter. Teach children to cough and sneeze into their elbow, wipe noses using disposable tissues, throw the tissue into the wastebasket, and wash their hands.When Should a Child with a Runny Nose Stay Home? Exclusion policies should be based on your general illness policies, not merely the color of the mucus. For example, you might decide to exclude any child who is too sick to participate, no matter what the cause or color of the discharge. Excluding children with runny noses and mild respiratory infections and colds is generally not recommended. As long as the child feels well, can participate comfortably and does not require a level of care that would jeopardize the health and safety of other children, he or she can be included. Exclusion is of little benefit since viruses are likely to be spread even before symptoms have appeared. When Should a Child with a Runny Nose Be Sent Home or Seen by a Health Provider? When a child with a runny nose looks more than mildly ill, has a rash, fever, difficulty breathing or seems to be in pain. When a child complains of earache and/or is pulling at his or her ears, which might be accompanied by fever and fussiness (all possible signs of ear infection). When a child has a green runny nose that lasts for more than 10 to 14 days accompanied by fever, headache, cough and foul-smelling breath. When a child has redness, sores and crusting of the skin around the nose and mouth. When an infant, especially under 4 months of age, has a fever, does not get better in a couple of days or gets worse. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.75What is a fever? A fever is a rise in body temperature that is above normal. Fevers are common in young children and are most often a sign that the body is fighting an infection. Usually a fever is not harmful, and it may help your child fight an illness. How do I know if my child has a fever? If your child's forehead, chest or face feels warm you can take your child's temperature using a thermometer. Normal body temperature is about 98.6\u00ba F. A temperature higher than 100\u00ba F (38\u00ba C), taken under the arm, is usually considered a fever. How do I take my child's temperature? Electric, digital thermometers are most often used because they are accurate, low-cost, and easy to use. Temperatures can be taken: In the armpit (under the arm) \u2014 recommended for infants and toddlers. By mouth (under the tongue) \u2014 okay for children older than 4 years. Rectally (in the bottom) recommended for infants under 3 months. Temperature strips and pacifier thermometers are not recommended because they are less accurate. Mercury glass thermometers should not be used because they are breakable and the mercury is toxic. How do I manage my child's fever? WITHOUT MEDICATION: A child with a fever, who is active and playful, usually does not require medication. Instead, focus on keeping your child comfortable: Dress your child in light weight clothing; do not overdress.Fever Fact Sheet for Families Keep the room at a temperature that is not too hot or cold. Give extra fluids to prevent dehydration. WITH MEDICATION: Fever reducing medication is sometimes given to help a child feel more comfortable, and/or when a fever is very high. Check with your child's health care provider before giving medications such as Acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae/Tempra\u00ae) or Ibuprofen (Motrin\u00ae/Advi l\u00ae)*. Always give medication according to instructions and use the measuring device that comes with the medication. Don't give your child aspirin because of its association with Reye's syndrome. Keep all medications out of children's reach. When should I call a health care provider? High or rapidly rising fevers can be a sign of a serious infection. Depending on your child's age, behavior, and other symptoms, you may need to seek medical help. Call your child's doctor if: Your child under 3 months has any fever, call your baby's health care provider immediately. Your child between 3 and 6 months has a fever above 101\u00ba F. Your child over 6 months has a fever above 103\u00ba F. Your child's fever lasts more than a few days. Your child has a fever and is not eating or playing or is having difficulty breathing. Your child has a stiff neck or rash. Your child has other signs of illness such as persistent diarrhea or vomiting, a cough or a severe sore throat. Your child has a seizure. Your child seems very sick or you have a question about your child's fever and are not sure what to do. *The California Childcare Health Program does not endorse or promote any commercial products. 1.76 California Childcare Health ProgramCalifornia Childcare H ealth Program cchp.ucsf.edu rev. 06/2018 Information Exchange on Children with Health Concerns Form Dear Health Care Provider: We are sending you this Information Exchange Form along with a Consent for Release of Information Form (see back) because we have a concern about the following signs an d symptoms that we and/or the parents have noted in this child, who is in our care.

Adapted from: Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (1993). Model Health Care Health Policies. Bryn Mawr: PA: Authors 1.78 California Childcare Health ProgramAn important part of setting health policies is to include those persons who keep the child care service going: yourself and your staff or family. Healthy staff are the key ingredient to quality child care. For this reason, providers must address the health issues and problems that affect staff in order to ensure a quality program. WAYS TO PROMOTE GOOD ADULT HEALTH Unfortunately, many child care providers neglect their personal needs in order to focus on those of the children. It is important to recognize that they can best care for children only when they keep themselves healthy. California requires verified health screening including screening and testing for tuberculosis. The following guidelines were designed for center staff, but are also recommended for family child care providers. Your staff health policy should specify the following for each type of examination: Content of the exam and who can perform the exam How often it must occur Special examinations for specific positions, if any, such as vision testing for drivers Who receives the findings Where the examinations can be performed, and who pays for the exam In order for examinations to be effective, the health professional conducting the exam must know the nature and demands of the adult's job. For instance, a woman planning to get pregnant will need to talk to her doctor about infectious diseases, or a chronic lower back problem may not interfere with the job performance of a social worker, but would surely affect the teacher of a toddler group.Pre-Employment Screenings Ideally, the results of a health screening should be received before a job offer is made final and before contact with the children begins. In practice, this is difficult to do \u2014 but doing it is still very important. It is hard to address health concerns after an individual has begun to develop relationships in your setting. An exam that follows actual employment may reveal health problems to which other staff and the children have already been exposed. It is recommended that a pre-employment health screening include: Assessment of emotional and physical fitness, including vision and hearing Assessment for the presence of contagious disease Review of immunization status and history of childhood illness Assessment and recommendations for specific medical conditions Additional assessment for the risk of exposure to chickenpox, cytomegalovirus (CMV), measles, mumps, hepatitis B, herpes, fifth disease and HIV , all of which may cause fetal damage, should be considered if the woman is of childbearing age or planning a pregnancy. Infectious Disease in Child Care Employees Infectious diseases are common in child care programs. Most are not serious and would probably spread at a similar rate from children to adults in a large family setting. However, since child care staff care for a number of young children, many of whom cannot control their secretions and have not yet learned principles of hygiene, there is the potential for the spread of infections to the employee. Employees may infect other employees, children, family members, and in the case of a pregnant employee, the fetus. Therefore, it is important that employees be familiar with the infections that are common in the child care setting, and the measures they can take to prevent them. For details on these infections and ways to reduce their spread, see \"Information on Specific Diseases\" (Section 4). Two important strategies which help prevent the spread of infection are immunization and standard precautions.Staff Health Policies Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.79Health Risks for Pregnant Child Care Providers Knowing your health history is especially important if you are pregnant or could become pregnant and are providing child care. Several childhood diseases can harm the unborn child, or fetus, of a pregnant woman exposed to these diseases for the first time. These diseases are: Chickenpox (Varicella Virus): First-time exposure to this virus during pregnancy may cause miscarriage, multiple birth defects or severe disease in newborns. Chickenpox can be a serious illness in adults. Most people (90 to 95 percent of adults) have had chickenpox or have been immunized against chickenpox and are immune. For women who do not know if they had chickenpox as a child, a blood test can verify their immune status. Cytomegalovirus (CMV): First-time exposure to CMV during pregnancy may cause hearing loss, seizures, mental retardation, deafness and/ or blindness in the newborn. In the United States, CMV is a common infection passed from mother to child at birth. Providers who care for children under two years of age are at increased risk of exposure to CMV . Most people (and 40 to 70 percent of women of childbearing age) have been exposed to CMV and are immune. Pregnant staff should discuss their risk of CMV exposure with their health care provider. Fifth Disease (Slapped Cheek): First-time exposure to fifth disease during pregnancy may increase the risk of fetal damage or death. Most people (and 30 to 60 percent of women of childbearing age) have been exposed to the virus and are immune. Rubella (German or Three Day Measles): First-time exposure to rubella during the first three months of pregnancy may cause fetal deafness, cataracts, heart damage, mental retardation, miscarriage or stillbirth. Rubella can also be a severe illness in adults. Child care providers can be considered immune only if (a) they have had a blood test for rubella antibodies and the laboratory report shows antibodies, or (b) they have been vaccinated against rubella on or after their first birthday. Providers who are not immune should be vaccinated. After vaccination, a woman should avoid getting pregnant for three months.STAFF ILLNESS AND EXCLUSION POLICY Conditions for Which Exclusion IS Required See the table on the following page for a list of conditions requiring exclusion. Health Limitations of Child Care Staff It is recommended that child care providers and volunteers have a health care provider's release to return to work in the following situations: When they have experienced conditions that may affect their ability to do their job (such as pregnancy specific injuries or infectious disease). After serious or prolonged illness. Before return from a job-related injury. During the course of an identified outbreak of any communicable illness in the child care setting, if the health department or health consultant determines that they are contributing to the transmission of the illness at the setting. 1.80 California Childcare Health ProgramLike children, adults are also capable of transmitting communicable diseases. A child care provider should be temporarily excluded from providing care to children if she or he has one or more of the following conditions: Condition Exclude from Child Care Setting Chickenpox Until six days after the start of rash or when sores have dried/ crusted. ShinglesOnly if sores cannot be covered by clothing or a dressing; if not, exclude until sores have crusted and are dry. A person with active shingles should not care for immune-suppressed children, or work with immune- suppressed staff or parents. Rash with fever or joint painUntil six days after rash starts. Measles and RubellaUntil diagnosed not to be measles or rubella, or as directed by the health department. VomitingIf two or more episodes of vomiting during the previous 24 hours, or if accompanied by a fever, until vomiting resolves or is determined to be due to such noninfectious conditions as pregnancy or a digestive disorder. Pertussis (whooping cough)Until after five days of prescribed antibiotic therapy, or as directed by the health department. MumpsUntil nine days after glands begin to swell, or as directed by the health department. Diarrheal illnessIf three or more episodes of loose stools during previous 24 hours, or if diarrhea is accompanied by fever, until diarrhea resolves. Hepatitis AFor one week after jaundice appears or as directed by health department, espec ially when no symptoms are present. Impetigo (a skin infection)Until 24 hours after prescribed antibiotic treatment begins and lesions are not draining. Active Tuberculosis (TB) [not a positive skin test only]Until the local health department approves return to the setting. Strep throat (or other streptococcal infection)Until 24 hours after initial antibiotic treatment, and fever has ended. Scabies/head lice/etc. Until after the first treatment; scabies until treatment has been completed. Haemophilus Influenza Type b (Hib)Until the prescribed antibiotic treatment has begun. Meningococal Infection As directed by the health department. Respiratory IllnessIf the illness limits the staff member's ability to provide an acceptable level of child care and compromises the health and safety of children or other staff. Herpes cold soresShould cover and not touch their lesions, carefully observe hand washing policies and must not kiss or nuzzle infants and children, especially those with dermatitis. Other conditions mandated by state public health lawAs required by law (consult your local health department). Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.81Parents are the primary teachers and role models for young children. When parents are asked what is the most important thing they look for when seeking child care, a healthy and safe environment is at the top of the list. With this in mind, child care providers must include parents in their efforts to create healthy environments and teach healthy habits to the children in their child care program. The child care providers enrolled in the health and safety class may be new providers, or experienced providers who are taking the course for the first time or repeating the class to refresh their knowledge and assure they are up- to-date. Whatever their knowledge level, they should communicate all health and safety messages in the curriculum to parents. There are several important times and methods for communicating with parents, so please be sure these are discussed throughout the module: Communicate without judgement: do not criticize anyone's parenting skills. Review all health and safety policies prior to enrolling a child. The health and safety of their children is a top priority for parents, so this review will reassure them that the provider will be working to promote the well-being of the children in their care. Communicate any changes in health and safety policies at parent meetings, by written notice in the primary language of the parent (when possible), and informally as you greet the parents at the beginning and end of the day. Communicate new knowledge gained on health and safety issues in newsletters, notes, handouts, posted information \u2014 any method you can think of that will reach a particular parent group. All of the steps above will demonstrate to the parents that the child care provider is working in the best interest of the children in their care.Communication with the Child Care Health Consultant Since few child care staff are trained as health professionals, each child care program should have access to a child care health consultant who can provide consultation and technical assistance on child health issues. This consultant should have expertise in child health and development, knowledge about the special needs of children in out-of- home child care settings, and the ability to link with public health resources. The child care health consultant's basic function is to enhance the quality of child care programs by promoting optimal health and safety standards. The health consultant should seek to establish a relationship with child care providers; identify, implement, and evaluate strategies to achieve quality child care; establish basic health and safety operational guidelines and plans for the child care program and provider; and serve in a liaison capacity to other health professionals and community organizations. The child care health consultant service can range from providing information over the telephone to more extensive services on-site. The health consultant must work closely with the local public health and child care resource and referral agencies. The child care health consultant can: Underscore the importance of a primary health care provider to serve as the \"medical home\" for each child. Link staff, families, and children with community health resources. Ensure a system for communication among the child care provider, parent, and primary health care provider and consult when health issues arise. Perform on-site assessments of the child care environment and/or program operations.Communicating about Illness in Child Care 1.82 California Childcare Health ProgramAssist child care providers in developing general policy statements and an annual plan for the child care program (e.g. management of infectious diseases, fevers, use of medications, exclusion policies, injury prevention, and nutrition guidelines). Provide telephone consultation to child care providers as health and safety issues arise concerning specific policies and procedures. Help child care providers obtain, understand, and use information about the health status of individual children and staff. Educate children, their families, and child care providers about child development, mental and physical health, safety, nutrition, and oral health issues. Help identify and implement health and safety improvement plans. Educate and collaborate with licensing staff and policy makers to improve regulations, inspections, resources, and policies that promote inclusive, safe and healthy child care. Communication with the Health Care Provider Most child care programs communicate with the health care provider through the parent. If a child appears sick, you can ask the parent to take the child to a health care provider. To communicate your concerns, send along an an \"Information Exchange on Children with Health Concerns\" form, or develop your own form or just write a simple note. The purpose of your communication is to share your specific observations about a child (and perhaps some information about your program) and to get an opinion about the child's condition, as well as recommendations on when a child can return to care. Usually confidentiality limits your talking directly to a child's doctor or clinic. So if you want specific information about a child's acute or chronic condition, you must get written authorization to do so (see the \"Consent for Exchange of Information\" form).Before you call, summarize your concerns and jot down the questions you want answered. While you may have opinions about what is wrong or what should be done, it is often useful to first describe what you have observed and listen to the health care provider's opinion. It can be helpful to repeat back your understanding of any recommendations and, if there is disagreement, ask for clarification. Parent-Provider Communication Just as child care providers have an obligation to report when children in care are exposed to a contagious disease, parents have the same obligation to report diseases to the child care program within 24 hours of a diagnosis, even if they keep their child at home. That way, the child care provider can alert other parents to watch for signs of that illness in their children and seek medical advice when necessary. You can use the \"Notice of Exposure to Contagious Disease\" , or a notice developed by your health consultant. Use \"Information on Specific Diseases\" to prepare the exposure notice. The confidentiality of the child should be maintained. You should not report the name of the child or other family member who is ill. When you report to your local health department, the parents of the child must be informed that you are required to report the disease and so is the health care provider. Also let them know you will be sending home exposure notices to parents but will not mention any names. Reporting Requirements When you know that a child has a contagious illness, you may need to take special measures so that the sickness does not spread to others. Some diseases or conditions must be reported to the local health department, child care licensing and others. Parents need to be informed that their child was exposed. Suspected child abuse or neglect must also be reported. In California, report to Child Protective Services. Check with the local authorities in your area to identify the appropriate reporting agency. You also should inform parents of this reporting requirement. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.83Young children enrolled in child care have a high incidence of illness such as upper respiratory tract infections, including otitis media and other temporary conditions such as eczema, diarrhea and exacerbation of asthma that may not allow them to participate in the usual activities. Most child care settings will need to provide at least temporary care for ill children. If a child becomes ill during the day, providers can help manage the illness and keep the child comfortable until a designated adult arrives. BASIC ISSUES FOR DECISION- MAKING Set Policies and Know When to Be Flexible Many health policies concerning the care of ill children have been based upon common misunderstandings about contagion, risks to ill children, and risks to other children and staff. Current child care research clearly shows that certain ill children do not pose a health threat. Also, the research shows that keeping certain other mildly ill children at home or isolated at the child care setting will not prevent other children from becoming ill. Appropriate reasons to exclude mildly ill children are: The child does not feel well enough to participate. The staff is not able to care for the sick child in the child care setting. The child's illness poses a threat to others.Severity Level Decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. Child care facilities should specify in their policies what severity levels of illness they can handle and their plan of care should be approved by their health consultant. SEVERITY LEVEL 1: Child feels well enough and shows high interest in participating in activities because of an absence of symptoms of illness such as recovery from pink eye, rash or chicken pox. Appropriate activities for this level include most of the normal activities for the child's age and developmental level, including both indoor and outdoor play. For full recovery, children at this level need no special care other than medication administration (according to the policy) and observation. SEVERITY LEVEL 2: Child demonstrates a medium activity level because of symptoms such as low-grade fever. Child may also be at the beginning or recovery period of an illness. Appropriate activities include crafts, puzzles, table games, fantasy play, and the opportunity to move about the room freely. SEVERITY LEVEL 3: Child's activity level is low because of symptoms that prevent much involvement. Appropriate activities are sleep and rest; light meals and liquids; passive activities such as stories and music; and for children who need physical comforting, being held and rocked (especially children under three years of age). For more information and recommendations for controlling the spread of specific infectious diseases, please see Module 1, Section 4, page 1.107 .Caring for Children with Mild Illness 1.84 California Childcare Health ProgramIssues for Providers to Consider When you need to decide whether to keep a mildly ill child at your child care setting, ask these questions: Are there sufficient staff (including volunteers) to change the program for a child who needs some modifications such as quiet activities, staying inside or extra liquids? Are staff willing and able to care for a sick child (wiping a runny nose, checking a fever, providing extra loving care) without neglecting the care of other children in the group? Is there a small space where the mildly ill child can rest if needed? Is there a space that might be used as a \"Get Well Room\" which meets California licensing regulations so that several children could be supervised at once? Is the child familiar with the caregiver? Are parents able or willing to pay extra for sick care if other resources are not available, so that you can hire extra staff as needed? Have parents made arrangements prior to illness for pick-up and care of ill children if they are not available?Issues for Parents to Consider When parents need to decide whether or not to send a child to child care, they must weigh many facts such as how the child feels (physically and emotionally), the child care program's ability to serve the needs of the mildly ill child, and income/work lost by staying home. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.85Some children in your child care setting may need to take medications during the hours you provide care for them. The administration of medicines at the child care facility should be limited to prescribed or nonprescription medication prescribed/ recommended by a health care provider for a specific child. Before agreeing to give any medication, whether prescription or over-the-counter (OTC), obtain written permission from the parent. Also, check with your local child care licensing agency regarding local regulations on administering medications. If you need to administer medications, the right medication must be given to the right child, in the right amount (dose), in the right way (route), and at the right time. Have a Written Policy Child care facilities should have a written policy for the use of prescription and nonprescription medication. Your medication policy should cover use of any commonly used nonprescription medication. Your health consultant could be helpful in preparing such a policy as it relates to acetaminophen, sunscreen, diaper cream, etc. Child care providers need to be aware of what medication the child is receiving, who prescribed the medicine and when, and what the known reactions or side effect may be if a child has negative reaction to the medicine. In the child care setting it is justified to give medications if: Dosage cannot be adjusted so that it can be taken before and after child care. A child has a chronic health condition (e.g. asthma, diabetes, allergies) which may require administration of medicine. Disability rights laws (ADA) prohibit child care providers from excluding children solely because they have a disability-related need for medication. For a child with a disability (and diabetes, for example, meets the definition of disability) a child care center must take steps to \"reasonably accommodate\" the child's medical needs so that the child may fully participate.Medications Which Can Be Given Safely The administration of medications at the child care program shall be limited to: Prescribed medications ordered by a health care provider for a specific child and a specific illness Nonprescription medications recommended by a health care provider for a specific child, with written permission of the parent or legal guardian, referencing a written or telephone instruction received by the child care program from the health care provider Medications which responsible staff have been trained to administer Medications which bear their original prescription label or a manufacturer's label and which are provided in safety lock containers, transported safely with regard to temperature, light and other physical storage requirements Medications for which all the criteria on the program's approval form have been met Medication Which You Can Accept To Administer Make sure that any prescribed medication parents may give you meets the following criteria: The first and last name of the child are on the container. The medication has been prescribed by a licensed health professional. Check to see that the name and phone number of the health professional who ordered the medication are on the container. The medication is in the original package or container. The container shows the date the prescription was filled. The container has an expiration date. The container has specific instructions for administering, storing and disposing of the medication. The container is childproof. The medication is for the current episode of illness. All medications, refrigerated or unrefrigerated, shall:Medication Administration Policy 1.86 California Childcare Health ProgramBe kept in an orderly fashion. Be stored away from food. Be stored at the proper temperature. Be inaccessible to children. Not be used beyond the date of expiration. Be given only for the purpose identified in the label/prescription. Who Should Be the Person Responsible for Administering Medication? Someone who: Has designated time for administering medications Has been trained to administer the type of medication as required by protocol of the local health consultant Will assure safe storage and disposal of medication Has access to locations where medication is stored and administration records are kept Knows the child who will receive the medication Knows about the potential reactions to the medications to be administered, and how to respond to such reactions Knows when and how to contact parents, pharmacists or health providers to clarify the need and instructions for administration of medication in child care Which Records Should Be Maintained? A medication record maintained on an ongoing basis by designated staff shall include the following: Specific, signed parental consent for the caregiver to administer the specific medication Prescription by a health care provider, if required Administration log listing names, dates, time, dose and medication names Checklist of information on medication brought to the setting by the parentsRational Use of Antibiotics Antibiotics are powerful drugs that kill bacteria that cause disease. If a child in your care has a bacterial infection, his/her health care provider may prescribe a specific type of antibiotic for a specific period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern and a major public health problem. The rise in antibiotic resistance prolongs illness, increases illness rates and results in higher and unnecessary health care costs. Health care providers report that many parents, often asked by child care providers, try to pressure them into dispensing unnecessary antibiotics. Children treated with an antibiotic are at increased risk of becoming carriers of resistant bacteria. Carriers of a resistant strain who develop illness from that strain are more likely to fail antibiotic therapy. In some conditions, therefore, such as ear infection with fluid, observation without antibiotic therapy is the preferable option, while in other conditions such as the common cold or cough, antibiotic therapy is not indicated. Child care providers can play a very important role in changing parents' awareness and understanding regarding the responsible use of antibiotics by having exclusion policies that do not exclude children unnecessarily or until a prescription is obtained.Remember These Five \"Rights\" When You Give Medicines: The right CHILD The right MEDICINE The right DOSE The right ROUTE (by mouth, or on skin, etc.) The right TIME Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.87POSTER California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.edu Rev. 06/2018MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION STOP INJURIES Right medication Right child Right amount Right time Right route 1.88 California Childcare Health ProgramMEDICATION ADMINISTRATION IN CHILD CARE PROGRAMS If you care for children, especially infants and toddlers, it's more than likely that you will care for a child with an acute or chronic health condition that requires giving medication. If a child has a mild illness or a non-contagious illness that requires medication there is no reason to exclude that child from your program. However, it is important to develop plans to assure that medications are given safely and stored correctly, and to seek advice when needed. All staff who work with children should have training on these practices. Check that the name of the child listed on the medication and the child receiving the medication are the same. Read and understand the label/prescription instructions related to measured dose, frequency, and other circumstances related to administration (such as in relation to meals). Administer the medication according to the prescribed methods and prescribed dose. Observe and report any side effects from medications. Document the administration of each dose by recording time and amount given. Medication should be given at home whenever possible, but there will be times when it must be given while the child is in child care. States have different regulations; be sure you understand the regulations for your state. California Community Care Licensing (CCL) regulations permit child care providers to administer medications under the following conditions: All prescription and nonprescription medications must bear the child's name and date. All medications must be administered according to the label direction. Permission and instructions must be provided by the parent for each medication. The instructions should not con flict with the label directions and should be fi led in the child's record. Nonprescription medications do not require approval of the child's health care provider if administered according to the product label and if parental approval and instructions are provided in writing from the parent. The instructions from the parent cannot con flict with the product label and must be filed with the child's records. (Please note that Caring for Our Children recommends obtaining a written approval or instruction from the child's health care provider.) Record administration of medication and inform the parent of daily medication administration. When no longer needed, return all medications to the parent. Always store medications in their childproof containers out of children's reach. Most Frequently Given Medications in Child Care Programs Antibiotics (given by mouth) \u2014 used to treat bacterial infections of the ear, respiratory tract, urinary tract or skin. Acetaminophen (e.g. Children's Tylenol or Panadol)- used to treat fever and pain. Antihistamines (e.g. Benadryl) \u2014 used to treat allergic reactions such as runny nose or hives. Bronchodilators \u2014 used to prevent or treat asthma attacks. Special equipment such as inhalers or nebulizers is also needed to give bronchodilators. When a nebulizer is needed, a special form from CCL must be completed by the parent and child care provider. Eye medication (liquid or ointment administered directly into the eye) \u2014 used to treat bacterial eye infections or \"pink eye.\" Iron (by mouth) \u2014 used to treat anemia. Topical medications \u2014 used to treat skin conditions such as diaper rash, infections. Medications for chronic conditions \u2014 used to treat seizure disorders, cystic fi brosis, and other chronic illnesses. Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.89LIC 9221 1.90 California Childcare Health ProgramTips for Administering Medication by Age FOR INFANTS Assemble all supplies within reach \u2014 medication, tissues, measuring devices \u2014 and wash your hands. Measure the correct amount of medication. If you are not able to hold the infant and give the medication at the same time, ask for help. Talk to the infant and gently touch his or her mouth with the dropper or medication syringe. If his or her mouth doesn't open, gently pull down the chin. Make smacking sounds with your mouth to model what you want. When the infant's mouth is open, place the dropper or syringe on the middle of the tongue and slowly drop the medication a little at a time. If the infant does not cooperate, gently slide the dropper or syringe between the inside of cheek and gums and slowly drop in medication. Or, try dropping premeasured amount of medication into a bottle nipple and let the infant suck it up. FOR TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS Follow the same preparation as for infants, but try to prepare toddlers by letting them know you are going to be giving medication and you will need their help. Pre-measured medication may be placed in a spoon or in a small cup. If they are cooperative they may not need your help and will do it themselves; if not, you may have to fi rmly hold them while you use a dropper or medication syringe to place medication in the mouth between cheek and gums. Allow time for the medication to be slowly swallowed. Always praise children for their cooperation. Medication Storage Medications should always be stored in their original container in a secure place out of the reach of children. Refrigerated medication should be stored separate from food in a plastic container or zip-lock bag in the refrigerator. Storing medication in clear plastic containers where it can be seen will help providers remember to give it. Do not freeze medication. If the medication is left unrefrigerated for a long period of time, check with a pharmacist to see if it is still effective.Common Routes (Ways) Medication Is Given Oral medication can be solid such as tablets or capsules or can be liquid such as elixirs or suspensions. All oral medications should be followed by two to four ounces of water unless otherwise indicated. Eye drops require some preparation. First gather supplies (medications, tissue, gloves) and wash hands. Clean eyelids, if necessary, wearing gloves. Position child on back or if seated, with head tilted back. Gently but fi rmly pull down lower lid and insert medication drops into pocket formed by lower lid. Be careful not to touch the eye or eyelid with container. Wipe closed eye with tissue. Praise the child for helping and wash your hands after removing the gloves. To apply eye ointment, follow the same procedure but drop a line of ointment along the lower lid, again without touching the container to the eye. Topical medications are applied to skin. First, clean the skin where you will be applying the medication. Wear gloves. Apply medication using applicator, gauze or gloves. Cover area if directed. Inhaled medication is delivered by a spray bottle, inhaler or nebulizer. The medication forms a fi ne mist to be inhaled. A nasal spray is fairly easy to administer in older children who can cooperate. Ask them to hold one nostril closed while you squirt and they inhale the medication into the open nostril. Medication delivered by an inhaler or nebulizer requires special training from the parent or health care provider and speci fic written instruction and warnings. The nebulizer is a machine that requires special cleaning after each use and instructions on its use must be provided by the parent and health care provider. There is a form available from CCL that discusses the appropriate training. Injected medication is delivered through a syringe/needle. Special training and written procedures are required when providing incidental medical services in licensed child care settings (such as insulin injections and blood glucose testing for diabetes). Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.91Reactions Children may react to the medications you administer. Typical reactions include rashes, tiredness and irritability. It's also very common for children to have diarrhea during antibiotic treatment, although as long as it can be contained in the pants or diaper there is no reason to exclude a child for this kind of diarrhea. If you have any concerns about a reaction, notify the parent and seek advice from the health care provider or pharmacist. Special Situations A number of situations may arise related to administering medication in child care: Parents may ask you to give their child herbal remedies. Because many remedies are not standardized, it's best not to give them. Suggest that parents administer these at home instead. Parents may not want to reveal what condition their child has. You must respect their desire for con fidentiality, but you still need to know if there are any medication reactions to watch for. Remember that a child's medication or health condition cannot be discussed with anyone without the parent's permission. You may unexpectedly need to give children a fever-reducing medication or something for pain if they become sick during the day. In these cases, it's acceptable to get permission from a parent by text message or email and follow the manufacturers' instructions for over-the-counter medication. You must then get written permission when the parent picks up the child. Working with a Pharmacist or Health Care Provider Patient information sheets on medications provide a wealth of information. They may be obtained free from pharmacies with each prescription and for nonprescription drugs upon request, or downloaded from www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ druginformation.html. The sheets describe how the drug works, what to do if a dose is forgotten, and which side effects might occur. Request that parents bring the information sheet with the medication so the child care staff will be more informed, but don't hesitate to ask questions of the prescribing health care provider or pharmacist if you need more information.Safeguards to Prevent Errors Assign a staff member to administer medications at the right time. Consult with the parent, pharmacist or health care provider if uncertain about the next dose. If a medication is crucial and has been left at home, ask the parent to return home and get medication before the child is admitted for the day. Establish a system for ensuring that medications are returned each day to the family for use at home. Develop systems to alert all staff members that a child has medication \u2014 something as simple as a red dot next to a child's name on the sign-in sheet can be a good reminder. Set an alarm clock for the times of administration. Use measuring devices that come with the medication, rather than household utensils, which are not accurate. Read the measured amount at eye level. Do not accept medication without written, understandable instructions. Check with a pharmacist or the child's health care provider if the instructions con flict with the label. Require that prescribed medication must have the child's name and current date. Make certain that medication is always administered by trained staff who know the children. Always provide written noti fication of medication administered so that the parent or other caregivers will know when to give the next dose. If a medication error is made, notify the parent immediately and consider seeking advice from the child's pharmacist or health care provider. REMEMBER THE FIVE R s Right Medication is given to the Right Child using the Right Amount at the Right Time given by the Right Route ALWAYS CHECK Parental Permission \u2014 must be in writing and filed in the child's record, see LIC-9221 Medication Label \u2014 the child's name, dosing instructions, special instructions Parent Noti fication \u2014 use standard form to notify parents of medication given Allergies and Reactions \u2014 check before giving medication if the child has allergies and watch for reactions afterward 1.92 California Childcare Health ProgramChildren with developmental disabilities, chronic illness or weak immune systems warrant special consideration either because they are unusually susceptible to infection or because they may infect other children. Children with Developmental Disabilities In general, children with developmental disabilities are not particularly vulnerable to infection and require no special precautions or procedures. A few categories of disabilities are associated with higher rates of infection, however, such as children with spina bifida, cerebral palsy or Down syndrome. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects individuals with disabilities and requires that every effort be made to reasonably accommodate disabilities. Child care providers are expected to modify their basic policies, practices and procedures to make reasonable accommodation to include children with disabilities in their programs. In most cases, such accommodation is compatible with a safe and healthy environment from which all the children in the child care setting can benefit. Child care providers must offer services in the most natural setting appropriate to the needs of the individual. In addition to making physical changes such as installing ramps, wide doors and restrooms that can accommodate children in wheel chairs, you may need to provide for a child's special physical, emotional or psychological needs. Other special needs may include assistance in feeding, following special dietary requirements, giving medicines and/ or performing medical procedures, and ensuring that special equipment is functional or is used properly. There is help available through many different programs to assist providers in properly caring for children with special needs.Before you admit a child with developmental disabilities, make sure that you can comfortably answer the following questions: Does the child's disability require more care than you are reasonably able to provide? Do you have the skills and abilities needed to perform medical or other duties required for the child's care, or can you readily acquire those skills? Is your child care program equipped to meet the health and safety needs of this child? Is the extra time you will need to devote to taking care of this child more than you can handle without putting the other children in your care at increased risk for illness or injury, or without causing you to neglect their needs? The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that as a provider responsible for all the children in your care, you should ensure that the extra demands on your time to care for a child with special needs are supported with additional resources, including help from experts. You should work with the child's parents and health care professionals to make sure that you have the support you need. Many child care providers are concerned that certain infections acquired before or around the time of birth (e.g., rubella, CMV , herpes simplex, hepatitis, and AIDS) may persist and be spread to other children or staff members. In some cases, these congenital infections pose a very small risk to others, and with proper precautions, affected children may safely participate in most child care or educational programs. In other cases, special precautions are warranted.Children with Special Needs Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.93Children with Chronic Illness Children with chronic illnesses, weakness or malnutrition are particularly vulnerable to infection. For example, infants who were premature, children who have chronic lung disease and children with cystic fibrosis frequently have a higher than average incidence of respiratory infections. Similarly, children with congenital heart disease may have unusual difficulty with some respiratory viruses. Children with diseases or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract are highly vulnerable to infections of the bladder and kidneys. Although it is not always possible to prevent these diseases, providers should be alert to the symptoms of infection and notify the child's parents and/or health care provider if they occur. Once treatment is initiated, these children should be able to participate in regular group care activities. Children with Weak Immune Systems Certain diseases or treatments can lower the body's natural defenses against infection. AIDS, cancer of the blood and some other diseases of the immune system significantly change the body's ability to fight infection, allowing even common organisms to quickly become life threatening. In children with previously normal immune systems, some drugs that are used to treat chronic conditions (e.g., steroids) suppress the body's ability to fight infection. Drugs used to prevent rejection of organ transplants or to temper the body's attack on its own organs can also interfere with the normal immune response. In a child with cancer, both the disease itself and the drugs used to treat it inhibit the body's defense mechanisms.Children with diseases or treatments that affect the immune system may need to be isolated from other children during periods of particular sensitivity. Their health care providers may prescribe special precautions regarding limited exposure to infection, particularly to chickenpox, since this disease can kill individuals with suppressed immunity. Keep in mind that vaccines with live viruses such as measles, rubella, chickenpox and polio (OPV) are not recommended for people with known weak immune systems. Despite the risks of spreading or getting infections, children in these special population groups need to have opportunities for socialization that are as normal as possible. With care and planning, the majority of these children can be safely integrated into child care and school settings. Administrators, teachers and child care providers should work closely with parents and health care providers to establish a safe environment for these children, their peers and staff members who care for them. 1.94 California Childcare Health ProgramSpecial Health Care Plan To be completed by the Child Care Health Consultant or Health Advocate.

Do families actively participate with the children?When observing and listening, pay particular attention to these five key indicators of quality inclusive child care: 1.98 California Childcare Health ProgramWhen families enroll their child, they should provide you with the contact information and consent that you will need if there is an emergency involving that child. All families of children in your care should know your emergency procedures. Let families know that you are trained in first aid and CPR as taught by a California approved training facility. Tell parents how often you take refresher courses. Tell them that in the event of an emergency, you will: Quickly assess the child's health. Call 9-1-1 or other appropriate emergency help as needed. Give first aid and CPR, if necessary. Contact families or the person they have listed to call in an emergency. Call Poison Control if their child is exposed to toxic substances. At All Times, You Should: Have emergency numbers posted by the phone: police and ambulance (9-1-1), and the poison control center (1-800-222-1222). Keep families' consent forms for emergency treatment and numbers for emergency contacts on file, and take a copy with you whenever you leave the facility. Maintain a current CPR and first aid certificate. Post first aid procedures where they can be easily seen. Write up an emergency procedure and evacuation route. Make sure you are familiar with it. Keep a fully stocked first aid kit in easy reach of all providers, but out of reach of children. Check the first aid kit regularly and restock it as necessary. In addition to the supplies listed for your first aid kit, you should also keep ice cubes or ice bags in the freezer to use to reduce swelling of some injuries. Place a stocked first aid kit in every vehicle used to transport the children. In addition to the items in your child care program's first aid kit, your vehicle kit should also include a bottle of water (refreshed on a regular basis), soap, and a first aid guide.Don't use first aid sprays and ointments. They may cause allergic reactions or skin damage. Wear gloves if you might come in contact with blood. Have first aid supplies handy on the playground. Consider keeping a zip-lock plastic bag stocked with disposable gloves, sterile wipes, gauze wrap and bandage strips in your pocket. If an Injury Occurs: 1. Stay calm. 2. Check for life-threatening situations (choking, severe bleeding, or shock). Do not move a seriously injured child. 3. Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number, if the child is seriously hurt. Make sure other children are safe. 4. Give CPR or first aid, if necessary. 5. Contact the family/emergency contact. 6. Record all injuries on a standard form developed for that purpose.Emergency Illness and Injury Procedures Prevention of Infectious Disease 1.99Smoking is prohibited in licensed child care programs in California. A policy that prohibits electronic cigarettes, alcohol, and using or having illegal drugs in your setting should be in place. The use of legal drugs (for example, marijuana and prescribed narcotics) that can diminish the ability to properly supervise and care for children should also be prohibited. No children, especially those with respiratory problems, should be exposed to additional risk from the air they breathe. Inhaling secondhand cigarette smoke has been linked to respiratory problems in children and is especially dangerous for young infants. Children exposed to cigarette smoke are at increased risk of dying of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and developing bronchitis, pneumonia and ear infections when they get common respiratory infections such as colds. Children with asthma are at risk of having their conditions get worse when they are exposed to cigarette smoke. Therefore, no smoking should be allowed when children are present. As more states legalize marijuana use for recreational and/or medicinal purposes, it is important for caregivers/teachers to be aware of the impact marijuana used medicinally and/or recreationally has on their ability to provide safe care. Modeling healthy and safe behavior at all times is essential to the care and education of young children.

These injuries do not happen because of fate, chance or bad luck. Child care providers should realize that injuries to children are understandable, predictable and preventable. Injury prevention is an essential part of quality child care programs, and a major responsibility of child care providers. By understanding how injuries happen, planning ahead and taking simple precautions, most injuries can be avoided. National standards developed by the American Public Health Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics stress injury prevention in the development of policies and procedures and in daily practices. The goal of injury prevention is to reduce the number and seriousness of injuries. It is important to identify potential hazards in the child care environment and to promote preventive actions such as environmental modifications, enforcement of safety policies and behavioral changes. Prevention Strategies Strategies for prevention of injuries in the child care setting can be translated into practice by: Conducting regular safety checks to identify hazards Modifying the environment to reduce hazards Supervising children Setting and enforcing rules for playground activities Educating children, parents and staff members about the importance of injury preventionINJURIES IN THE CHILD CARE SETTING Injuries occur as a result of unsafe conditions in the environment, participation in activities which are not developmentally appropriate, and/or a lack of adult supervision. Age and sex of children, size of the facility, adult-to-child ratio, specific program offerings (e.g., swimming and field trips), playground equipment, supervision, and enforcement of policies and regulations are some of the factors that may influence the risk of injury in child care settings. Successful strategies for preventing child care injuries require a better understanding of injuries\u2014 what injuries happen, to whom, where, how, and when. What Types of Injuries Are Common? Children attending child care are most likely to face the following types of injuries: Minor injuries such as cuts, scrapes and bruises Severe injuries such as head injuries, broken bones, internal injuries, dislocations, or dental injuries Poisoning Drowning Burns Choking and suffocation Prevention of Injuries 2.3CHILDHOOD INJURIES: What Minor injuries (such as cuts, scrapes, and bruises) Severe injuries (such as head injuries, broken bones, internal injuries, dislocations, or dental injuries) Poisoning Drowning Burns Choking and suffocation Who Most frequent among 2- to 5-year-olds. More boys than girls after age five How Falls Involvement with another child Colliding with objects Contact with objects Motor vehicle accidents Bicycle accidents Drowning Exposure or access to toxic substances When In the summer and spring Late in the morning and late in the afternoon Why Lack of safety knowledge Lack of child's ability, imitation of others more physically advanced Hazards in the environment and access to toxic materials Insufficient use of safety devices Lack of safety precautions and supervision Who Gets Injured? Studies Show That: Injury rates are low for infants and increase with the age of the child. Injuries are most frequent among two- to five-year-olds. The difference in rates of injuries for boys and girls in preschool is small. How Are Children Injured? The following factors contribute to injuries and may be divided between child-related factors and environment-related factors: Falls are the leading cause of serious injuries. The playground is the major site of injury in the child care setting and accounts for 50 to 60 percent of all child care injuries. Sometimes furniture, stairs or windows are also involved. Another child is involved (fighting, pushing, colliding, throwing, or biting). The child collides with objects such as moving playground equipment, furniture, part of the building, plants, toys, a fence or gate, etc. The child is cut by a sharp edge, burned by a hot surface, hot tap water or heater, or poisoned by toxic materials or substances. Injuries occur related to transportation and cars. When Do Injuries Happen? In the summer and spring, probably due to outdoor play and particularly the use of playground equipment Late in the morning and late in the afternoon, when children are hungry or tired, and when providers are busy or less available to supervise Why Are Children Injured? Children may be injured due to: Lack of safety knowledge Lack of ability or imitation of others more physically advanced Hazards in the environment and access to toxic substances Lack of safety precautions, safety devices or supervision 2.4 California Childcare Health ProgramRisk of Injury at Developmental Stages Children are at risk for injuries because developmental factors limit their physical, mental and emotional abilities. They grow quickly and want to test and master their environment. Their curiosity, fearlessness and lack of safety knowledge put them at risk when exploring and attempting actions for which they may lack the skills and physical capabilities. The type of injuries children may incur is related to their development. For example, an infant's neck is too weak to support the weight of his head, so he will be at risk of serious injury and even death if shaken. Infants and toddlers explore their surroundings by putting objects in their mouths, and therefore are at risk of choking. Toddlers like to walk fast, climb and reach for objects, and therefore are at risk of falling or poisoning. Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of injury in all age groups. As child care providers, we want to assure that children are challenged by their environment and can explore safely. Knowing the children in your care and being careful to remove hazards and set up the environment with their abilities in mind can prevent injuries. Because each child develops at her own rate and not according to any exact age, the examples on the following pages are only a framework. One child may crawl at six months, another at one year.

Prevention of Injuries 2.7Safe Infant Sleep: Reducing the Risk of SIDS and Other Sleep-Related Infant Deaths It is a truly tragic event when a seemingly healthy infant dies suddenly and unexpectedly. And when the death happens in a child care program, it can be devastating; not only for the family of the child, but also for the child care provider and other families in the program. Safe infant sleep practices and environments reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and other sleep-related infant deaths. SIDS is the death of an infant younger than 1 year of age that is unexplained after a thorough scene investigation, autopsy, and review of the clinical history. Ninety percent of SIDS deaths occur before an infant reaches 6 months of age, and peak between 1 and 4 months of age. Risk factors for SIDS include: unsafe sleep practices and environments; a critical period of development; and the individual vulnerability of an infant. Other sleep-related infant deaths (such as suffocation, asphyxia, entrapment, and strangulation) have similar risk factors. A recent study showed that infants who die in child care were more likely to die during the first week. More deaths occurred when infants were: Used to sleeping on their backs at home and were placed on their stomachs for sleep in child care Allowed to sleep in an unsafe sleep environment in child care (for example: a car seat, stroller, futon, pillow, or bean bag) (Kassa, Moon, Colvin, 2016) The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a safe infant sleep environment and safe infant sleep practices that can reduce the risk for all unexpected sleep-related infant deaths. (A A P, 2 016 )Recommendations for Safe Infant Sleep Environments and Practices in Child Care Programs Place infants on their backs, for every sleep, until they are 1 year old. Place infants on a firm mattress, with a fitted sheet, that fits snugly in a crib. Only use cribs (including bassinets and play yards) that meet current Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) standards. Assign a crib to each infant, and place only one infant in a crib. No toys (including mobiles), soft objects, stuffed animals, pillows, bumper pads, blankets, positioning devices or loose bedding should be in, attached to, or draped over the side of the crib. Do not allow infants to get overheated when they sleep. Provide a sleeping area that is well ventilated, at a temperature that is comfortable for a lightly clothed adult. If additional warmth is needed, a one-piece blanket sleeper or sleep sack may be used. Dress infants in no more than one layer more than an adult. Remove bibs, clothing with ties or hoods, and hats or other head coverings, and jewelry. Do not allow infants to sleep on a couch, sofa, armchair, cushion, futon, bed, or pillow; or in a car seat, stroller, swing or bouncy chair. If an infant falls asleep anyplace other than a crib, move the infant to a crib right away. If an infant arrives at your program asleep in a car seat, move the infant to a crib. Offer a pacifier for sleep, if provided by the family. Pacifiers do not need to be reinserted if they fall out after an infant is asleep. Do not attach a pacifier to a string or ribbon to be worn around an infant's neck or fastened to an infant's clothing. Actively supervise sleeping infants by sight and sound at all times. Provide adequate lighting so sleeping infants can be seen. Observe breathing and skin color. If a baby is found unresponsive with no breathing or pulse, begin CPR and call 9-1-1.MODULE 2 / SECTION 2 Preventing Childhood Injuries SIDS and Other Sleep-Related Infant Deaths 2.8 California Childcare Health ProgramWhat Else Can Child Care Providers Do? Enforce no-smoking laws and regulations Infants who are exposed to smoke have a higher risk of dying from SIDS. California Community Care Licensing Regulations prohibit smoking in licensed child care centers and in family child care homes. California law prohibits smoking in a car when children are present. Create a safe sleep policy and educate staff Having a policy for safe infant sleep is your promise to families that you are doing everything possible to keep their infant safe while sleeping. Give families a copy of your safe sleep policy upon enrollment. (See the CCHP Model Safe Sleep Policy for Infants in Child Care Programs.) Provide staff development on the principles of safe infant sleep. Closely monitor staff compliance with your safe sleep policy. Review your emergency response system with all staff members on a regular basis. Be breastfeeding friendly Breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of SIDS. In many cases, returning to work is a barrier to breastfeeding. Support mothers to continue breastfeeding after their maternity leave is over and they return to their work or school schedules. For information on how to support breastfeeding families (including a sample policy; an infant feeding plan template; and information on safely handling, storing, and feeding breastmilk), see Supporting Breastfeeding Families, a Toolkit for Child Care Providers on the resource list. Educate families Discuss safe infant sleep practices with families. Include information about: room-sharing without bed-sharing, breastfeeding, not allowing infants to routinely sleep in car seats, not smoking around infants, keeping immunizations up-to-date. Distribute written handouts, and put up posters on your walls or bulletin boards. Provide information about safe sleep upon enrolling new families. Reach out to the SIDS Coordinator at your Local Health Department for support with family education and staff development. Provide supervised \"Tummy Time\" when infants are awake Tummy time is important for infant growth and development. It builds muscle strength and coordination in the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen, and back that are needed to reach important developmental milestones (such as how to push up, roll over, sit up, crawl, and pull to a stand). Infants must be awake and supervised for Tummy Time. See the CCHP Health & Safety Note, Tummy Time for Infants on the resource list. Monitor the immunization status of infants Research suggests that immunizations may protect against SIDS. California law requires children to be immunized before child care entry. Child care programs are required to enforce the immunization laws, maintain records, and submit reports to public health agencies. Crib safety Do not resell, donate or give away a crib that does not meet the current crib standards. CPSC recommends disassembling an old crib before discarding it. Local public health departments and advocacy groups can help provide low-cost or free cribs or play yards for families and child care providers with financial need. What if infants roll over? Once infants can roll from front to back, and from back to front easily, continue to place them on their backs for sleep, but allow them to assume their preferred position. About swaddling... Although some newborns and young infants may be swaddled for sleep at home , swaddling of infants is not recommended in child care programs. (AAP , NRC, APHA, 2011) The risk of death is high if swaddled infants are placed on, or roll onto, their stomachs. (AAP , 2016) In the home, swaddling should not be used once an infant shows signs of trying to roll over (usually before an infant is three months old).

Always put your baby to sleep on his or her back until 1 year of age. Place your baby on a firm mattress, with a fitted crib sheet, in a crib that meets the Consumer Product Safety Commission safety standards. Keep the crib free from toys, mobiles, stuffed animals, pillows, crib bumpers, blankets, positioning devices and extra bedding. Breastfeeding is recommended. The safest place for your baby to sleep at night is in a crib in the room where you sleep, but not in your bed, for at least the first six months. Keep the bedroom well ventilated, at a temperature that is comfortable for a lightly clothed adult. Don't put your baby to sleep on an adult bed, sofa/ couch, armchair, cushion, pillow, or in a car seat, stroller, swing, or bouncy chair. Check your baby periodically while asleep. Don't allow smoking where your baby plays or sleeps. Don't overdress your baby. If additional warmth is needed, use a one-piece blanket sleeper or sleep sack. Remove bibs, clothes with hoods or ties, and hats. You may offer a pacifier, once breastfeeding is established.References & Resources American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). (2016).

Since that time the number of infants dying of SIDS has dropped by more than half. Putting infants to sleep on their backs is a simple and effective practice for reducing the risk of SIDS. But the other part of the \"Back to Sleep Campaign\" message is \"Tummy to Play.\" Many infants are not getting enough \"tummy time.\" Why is \"Tummy Time\" important? Infants now miss out on the 12 hours of tummy time that they used to get when sleeping on their tummies. Many infants also spend long hours in swings, car and infant seats when awake. Because of these practices, some infants are developing motor delays. Tummy time is important because it helps infants: stretch and strengthen the head, neck, shoulder and back muscles they will need to learn important motor skills (for instance, how to push up, roll over, sit up, crawl, and pull to a stand). develop their sensory-perceptual, social-emotional, problem solving, balance, visual, and hearing abilities. develop normally-shaped heads (infants who spend most of their time on their backs when asleep and in infant seats when awake are at risk for developing flat spots on the backs of their heads). How can we make sure infants get enough \"Tummy Time\" when they are awake? The way to prevent these problems is to make sure infants spend plenty of time on their tummies, in the \"prone\" position, starting when they are newborns. Some infants get fussy when they are put on their tummies because they are not used to it, and it is hard work for an infant to hold his head up. Unless babies are put on their tummies (prone) to play from the first days and week of life, they may not easily accept \"tummy time.\" Tips for making tummy time more interesting: Lay the infant over your leg while you are sitting on the floor Buy an exercise ball* that is 60 centimeters in diameter. Lay the infant over the ball on his tummy and move him gently back and forth and from side to side by rolling the ball carefully, and move him up and down by pushing down gently on his back.Health & Safety Notes Prevention of Injuries 2.13UCSF California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.edu 07/2018 p.2 Put the infant on her tummy on a blanket on the floor. Make the floor interesting by choosing a blanket with an interesting pattern or texture, or a special tummy time mat. Lie down on the floor with the infant. She will enjoy exploring you as well as the toys on the floor. Lie down with the infant on your chest tummy-side down. Remember, a happy infant develops best. If an infant starts to fuss, try to make tummy time more interesting through gentle movement or a change of toys. Rhythm and movement together work wonders for infants' development, so turn on some music for tummy time. At first, you may have to try tummy time for several short periods during the day until the infant gets used to being on his tummy. When to seek help Infants should be holding up their heads and pushing up on their arms by the end of three months. Infants who are getting enough tummy time and are still delayed in reaching these milestones should be evaluated by their health care provider. * Make sure that the infant doesn't pull the plug on the ball that holds the air in as the plug could be a choking hazard Resources Coulter-O'Berry C & Lima, D.

Older infants can be placed lengthwise on the bolster (with an arm and a leg on either side of the bolster) and rolled gently from side to side.

The term \"shaken baby syndrome\" describes a set of symptoms seen in infants who have sustained a head injury from shaking. Medical professionals have recommended replacing the term \"shaken baby syndrome\" with the term \"abusive head trauma\" because it includes the various ways a child could suffer a head injury as a result of abuse such as: shaking; dropping; throwing; hitting; or hitting child's head against a surface or object while shaking. Long-term Effects of Abusive Head Trauma Children who are victims of abusive head trauma may experience mild to severe injuries. The following may occur as a result of the bleeding or damage caused by abusive head trauma: partial or total blindness; hearing loss; paralysis; problems with motor development; seizure disorders; cerebral palsy; sucking and/or swallowing disorders; intellectual disabilities; speech and language delay or disability; problems with executive function; and attention, memory, and behavior problems. Because of the serious nature of these injuries, it is crucial that child care providers have policies in place for preventing and identifying shaken baby syndrome/ abusive head trauma. Developmental Vulnerabilities and Abusive Head Trauma Infants are especially vulnerable to abusive head trauma. Their fragile brains and skulls are rapidly developing and a sudden impact can cause irreversible injury. In addition, infants are unable to express their needs and feelings using words. Instead, they cry. A phase of alarming crying is considered a normal developmental phase in young infants. Caregiver anger or frustration over prolonged crying is associated with the risk for shaking that can result in serious injury or death. Other risk factors for abusive head trauma in infants and young children include: having special needs; having multiple siblings; living in poverty; and having colic or other kinds of pain and discomfort. Caregiver Training The first step to protect young children from shaken baby syndrome/abusive head trauma is to raise awareness through education. All child care providers who work with infants and young children need periodic training in preventing abusive head trauma. Training should include 1) strategies for coping with a crying, fussy, or distraught infant or child and 2) information on how to recognize the signs of shaken baby syndrome/abusive head trauma. Strategies for Coping with a Crying Infant or Child All babies cry. While it can be difficult to hear, the following strategies can help a caregiver act safely when faced with a persistently crying baby. Manage your stress and practice self-care. Be aware of your feelings of increasing frustration or anger, and use a calming strategy that works for you. For example, take a few deep breaths or breathe deeply while counting to ten. If you are unable to bring your frustration under control on your own, then find a way to take a break from the situation without leaving children unsupervised, such as: Asking a coworker to take over with a challenging child Asking for another assignment Taking a short break Learn about typical infant development and how to manage infant crying. Try different techniques for soothing crying infants. Some babies cry more and other babies cry less, but it is normal for babies to cry. For more information about understanding and managing crying, see Period of PURPLE Crying\u00ae www.purplecrying.infoShaken Baby Syndrome/Abusive Head Trauma Prevention of Injuries 2.15The following child care setting mitigations to reduce shaken baby syndrome/abusive head trauma are acceptable per California Child Care Licensing Regulations for providers who may be alone in family child care homes: The child care provider may designate a qualified substitute provider who can provide relief to a child care provider who is stressed by a baby's crying. It is appropriate to ask someone to help take care of a crying baby while the care provider gets some respite. In licensed child care, the only acceptable substitutes are those who have been fingerprint-cleared and meet all necessary requirements established by Title 22 and the Health and Safety Code. The parent/guardian may also designate an emergency contact, in addition to herself/himself, that can be called if the baby's crying is alarming. If a child care provider realizes that a baby's crying is a trigger for the provider's negative stress reactions, that provider should consider not providing care to infants. Remember: It is never okay to shake or strike a child. Signs of Shaken Baby Syndrome/ Abusive Head Trauma As a child care provider, you may be the first to recognize when a child has been a victim of abusive head trauma. It's important to know the signs and respond so that the child can receive medical attention as quickly as possible. In many cases there are no symptoms at all, but in more severe cases an infant or young child may have: Difficulty staying awake, Irritability, lack of smiling, Poor sucking or swallowing, decreased appetite, or vomiting Decreased muscle tone, Inability to lift the head, Difficulty breathing, blue color (due to lack of oxygen), Unequal pupil size, Inability to focus the eyes or track movement, Bleeding around the eyes, Bulging or swelling of the head, forehead, or soft spot Bruises around the head, neck, or chest Rigidity of the body, Tremors, seizures, Coma. 2.16 California Childcare Health ProgramCONCUSSION FACT SHEET FOR PARENTS WHAT IS A CONCUSSION? A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury. Concussions are caused by a bump or blow to the head. Even a \"ding,\" \"getting your bell rung,\" or what seems to be a mild bump or blow to the head can be serious. You can't see a concussion. Signs and symptoms of concussion can show up right after the injury or may not appear or be noticed until days or weeks after the injury. If your child reports any symptoms of concussion, or if you notice the symptoms yourself, seek medical attention right away. WHAT ARE THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CONCUSSION? If your child has experienced a bump or blow to the head during a game or practice, look for any of the following signs of a concussion: SYMPTOMS REPORTED BY ATHLETE: Headache or \"pressure\" in head Nausea or vomiting Balance problems or dizziness Double or blurry vision Sensitivity to light Sensitivity to noise Feeling sluggish, hazy, foggy, or groggy Concentration or memory problems Confusion Just not \"feeling right\" or is \"feeling down\" SIGNS OBSERVED BY PARENTS/ GUARDIANS: Appears dazed or stunned Is confused about assignment or position Forgets an instruction Is unsure of game, score, or opponent Moves clumsily Answers questions slowly Loses consciousness (even briefly) Shows mood, behavior, or personality changes [ INSERT YOUR LOGO ] Brain Injury and Concussion Prevention of Injuries 2.17DANGER SIGNS Be alert for symptoms that worsen over time. Your child or teen should be seen in an emergency department right away if s/he has: One pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye) larger than the other Drowsiness or cannot be awakened A headache that gets worse and does not go away Weakness, numbness, or decreased coordination Repeated vomiting or nausea Slurred speech Convulsions or seizures Difficulty recognizing people or places Increasing confusion, restlessness, or agitation Unusual behavior Loss of consciousness (even a brief loss of consciousness should be taken seriously) WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU THINK YOUR CHILD HAS A CONCUSSION? 1. SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION RIGHT AWAY A health care professional will be able to decide how serious the concussion is and when it is safe for your child to return to regular activities, including sports. 2. KEEP YOUR CHILD OUT OF PLAY . Concussions take time to heal. Don't let your child return to play the day of the injury and until a health care professional says it's OK. Children who return to play too soon - while the brain is still healing - risk a greater chance of having a second concussion. Repeat or later concussions can be very serious. They can cause permanent brain damage, affecting your child for a lifetime. 3. TELL YOUR CHILD'S COACH ABOUT ANY PREVIOUS CONCUSSION. Coaches should know if your child had a previous concussion. Your child's coach may not know about a concussion your child received in another sport or activity unless you tell the coach. HOW CAN YOU HELP YOUR CHILD PREVENT A CONCUSSION OR OTHER SERIOUS BRAIN INJURY? Ensure that they follow their coach's rules for safety and the rules of the sport. Encourage them to practice good sportsmanship at all times. Make sure they wear the right protective equipment for their activity. Protective equipment should fit properly and be well maintained. Wearing a helmet is a must to reduce the risk of a serious brain injury or skull fracture. However, helmets are not designed to prevent concussions. There is no \"concussion-proof\" helmet. So, even with a helmet, it is important for kids and teens to avoid hits to the head. HOW CAN I HELP MY CHILD RETURN TO SCHOOL SAFELY AFTER A CONCUSSION? Children and teens who return to school after a concussion may need to: Take rest breaks as needed Spend fewer hours at school Be given more time to take tests or complete assignments Receive help with schoolwork Reduce time spent reading, writing, or on the computer Talk with your child's teachers, school nurse, coach, speech-language pathologist, or counselor about your child's concussion and symptoms. As your child's symptoms decrease, the extra help or support can be removed gradually.

Child abuse is a non-accidental injury or pattern of injuries to a child for which there is no reasonable explanation. It is a very sensitive issue that needs to be carefully handled. There are different types of child abuse. In physical abuse, children are slapped, hit, kicked or pushed, or have objects thrown at them, causing wounds, bruises, broken bones or other injuries. Severe physical abuse can cause major injury, permanent physical or emotional damage, or even death. Sexual abuse includes a wide range of sexual behavior, including fondling, masturbation, intercourse or involving children in pornography. Emotional abuse involves humiliation, dishonoring or other acts carried out over time that terrorize or frighten the child. Neglect means not feeding or caring for a child's basic needs or not adequately supervising a child. Child abuse is usually a pattern of behavior, not a single act. Children are most often abused by parents, stepparents or other caregivers. You Can Protect Children from Abuse Reporting suspected child abuse is difficult, but the children you care for trust you to protect them from people who might hurt them. Respond to your \"gut\" feeling and take actions that may save a child from harm! All child care providers are required by law (mandated) to make a report to their local Child Protective Services agency if they have a reasonable suspicion that a child in their care has been abused or neglected. This includes child care center directors, teachers and aides, family child care providers, and school-age child care providers. The center or agency you work for is not allowed to fire or discipline you for making a report, even if your supervisor disagrees with you. What Is Reasonable Suspicion? Reasonable suspicion is the legal term used in California's child abuse reporting law. Reasonable suspicion means the suspicion is based on facts that would cause a reasonable person to suspect child abuse. Child Abuse Prevention The following behaviors could indicate abuse or neglect. Remember that all children occasionally act in these ways. Mood swings. Fear of certain people. Grouchiness or irritability. Is \"too good,\" does not test boundaries. Uses manipulative behavior to get attention. Low self-esteem. Unexplained developmental delays. Inability to get along with other children. Is wary of adult contact, rejects affection. Has a vacant expression, cannot be drawn out. Seeks constant affection from anyone; is very clingy. Complains frequently of stomach aches or other pains; vomits. What should you do if you suspect abuse? You must report it. 1. It may help to talk to other staff members to see what they think. But even if they disagree with your opinion, if you have a reasonable suspicion of abuse or neglect, you must report it. It is your legal responsibility. Remember, you cannot get in legal trouble for making a report, only for not making one when you have reason to suspect abuse. 2. Make a report by phoning the local Child Protective Services agency (CPS) or, in an emergency, call the police. You will also need to fill out a form and send it to CPS within 36 hours. You have the right to get information from CPS about what happens to the family after the report is made. Remember, you don't have to be sure that abuse or neglect has occurred, but you must have a reasonable suspicion. You cannot be punished for reporting child abuse, but if you do not report, you can be punished. You can call your local Child Protection Services agency for advice if you are not sure. Call 9-1-1 if the child is in immediate danger or if the child needs urgent medical care. Prevention of Injuries 2.193. Tell the CPS worker about your relationship with the family and ways you can support the family. 4. After making your report, be sure to call your Community Care Licensing evaluator and tell him or her of the situation. This protects you from possible complaints by the parents and lets the evaluator know you are acting responsibly. Reporting Suspected Child Abuse Can Be Difficult Thinking about child abuse can feel bad, and taking action can be difficult. Even though you care very much about the child and know your legal duty, you may still: Doubt your own judgment and feel disbelief that this family could commit child abuse. Fear that the parents may threaten or harm you or the child. Fear that you will lose your job or that the child will be withdrawn from your program. Feel nervous about dealing with authorities because of bad past experiences. Have strong emotions about child abuse because of your own family experiences. All of these feelings are normal reactions to a stressful situation. While carrying out your responsibility to report suspected abuse, don't forget your own feelings. Find the emotional support you need. Should You Talk to the Child's Parents? Whether you talk to the child's parents will depend on the situation, your relationship with the family, and where the abuse occurred. Think about whether talking to the parents might put the child in danger. If you are unsure, talk it over with a social worker at the Child Protective Services agency. If you do talk to the parents, tell them that you made a report and what you said. Explain that you were required by law to do this. Tell them how the process works and what might happen next. Even though you may feel angry or scared, remember the parents need help and support to find a way out of the abuse cycle. Ask what you can do to help and offer information about local support services. What Should You Say to the Staff, the Other Families and the Children? When you make a report, talk to the people at the Child Protective Services agency to find out what will happen next. Remember that the family has a right to privacy. Information about them is confidential unless they give you permission to share it with specific people. You can tell those staff members who work with the child that a report has been made and what to expect. Other parents may be aware of the problem. You can reassure them that their children are not in danger without telling them any confidential information. You can simply say that you have concerns about the child and are doing whatever you can to help. If the child has left your care, you can just say that they have gone on to another program; you don't need to say why. You may also need to say something to the other children in your program. If the child leaves, you can simply tell the other children that they have left, and that you will miss them. If the child is receiving extra attention, you can explain to the others that you are helping make sure that they are okay, which takes extra time. You should add that you would do the same for them if they needed help. What You Can Do to Prevent Child Abuse Child care settings are the only places where young children are seen day after day by people trained to observe their appearance, behavior and development. You may be the first person to suspect and report abuse and neglect. You also may be the biggest source of support and information available to the parents you serve. You can: Give families information on child development and appropriate discipline. Model good child care practices. Build a trusting relationship with families and discuss concerns. Help families establish positive relationships with their children. Refer families to community resources and support services. Inform parents that you are required to report suspected child abuse. Know the signs of parent burnout so you can offer support. Have a parent-staff workshop at your center with information about the issues. Educate young children about their right to say no. 2.20 California Childcare Health ProgramTHREE INDICATORS OF THE THREE TYPES OF CHILD ABUSE* Neglect and Emotional AbusePhysical Abuse Sexual Abuse Physical SignsThe child: Is underweight or small for age Is always hungry Is not kept clean Is inappropriately dressed for weather Has not received needed medical care The child: Has unexplained bruises or welts in unusual places Has several bruises or welts in different stages of healing, in unusual shapes, or in clusters Has unexplained burns Has unexplained broken bones or dislocations Has unexplained bites or explanation for injury differs from that of a parent or caretaker The child: Has difficulty walking or sitting Is wearing torn, stained or bloody underwear Has pain, swelling or itching of genitals Has bruises, cuts or bleeding on genitals or anal area Feels pain when urinating or defecating Has a discharge from the vagina or penis, or a sexually transmitted disease Behavioral SignsThe child: Begs for or steals food Frequently arrives at child care early and leaves later than expected Has frequent, unexplained absences Is overtired or listless The child: Tells you they have been hurt by parents or others Becomes frightened when other children cry Says the parents or caretakers deserve to be punished Is afraid of certain people The child: Acts withdrawn, over- involved in fantasy, or much younger than age Displays sophisticated or bizarre sexual knowledge or behavior Exhibits excessive or unusual touching of genitals Tells you they have a secret they are not allowed to tell anyone. Tries to hurt themselves *Many of these indicators also occur with children who have not been abused. Look for clusters of indicators, and do not reach the conclusion that a child has been abused too quickly. Remember, you must report your reasonable suspicion of abuse.

If you feel you may hurt a child\u2014take a break, talk to a co-worker, call your local child abuse prevention program, council or warm line. If you are working with families from a different culture, you might consult with a local resource, i.e. Asian Resources, Indian Health Services, etc. It is always a good idea to keep very careful notes when you are concerned about a child. Record your observations, the circumstances, time and date. Date and sign all notes. Note any significant changes in the child's contacts with others. And above all, remember\u2014if you suspect abuse, you must report it. Be Prepared... Before anything happens, complete this resource sheet and put it by your phone. Call your local Child Protective Services (CPS) agency to learn more about their procedures and ask them to send you report forms to keep in your file. Inform parents when they enroll their child that you are a mandated reporter.Free online training Mandated child abuse reporting training is required for all licensed child care providers in California (AB 1207).

Hundreds of children in the United States die and countless others are injured every year as a result of burns. Children ages five or younger are especially vulnerable to burns and have one of the highest fire death rates. Hot liquids\u2014not fire\u2014are the most common cause of burns to young children. Hot liquids burn like fire and can cause serious and painful burns. However, fires caused by playing with matches and lighters are the number one cause of fire-related deaths among young children. In the child care environment, four types of hazards may contribute to the risk of fire and burns: scalding, contact, electrical and chemical. Planning ahead and practicing fire prevention skills can reduce the chances of a fire occurring, protect children and adults, and reduce property damage. Burns and Fire What a Child Care Provider Can Do to Reduce Burn Injuries As a child care provider, you can take the following steps to reduce the risk of fires and burns in your facility: 1. Provide safety education. Help the children learn about hazards that can cause fires and burns. They should be taught that some objects are off-limits for play. 2. Check for environmental hazards and limit access to burn-producing objects. 3. Safety devices such as smoke alarms and fire extinguishers should be present and in working condition. 4. Plan the escape routes in advance. Children should have regular practice drills for fire evacuation. Practice how to crawl low under smoke, and how to stop, drop to the ground, and roll if their clothes catch fire. 5. Model preventive behaviors that will reinforce fire and burn accident prevention. 6. Communicate your prevention activities to parents so they can support your efforts and prevent burns and fires at home. 7 . Invite a first responder from the local fire depart- ment to your program for a safety workshop. Prevention of Injuries 2.23CAUSES OF FIRE AND BURNS IN THE CHILD CARE ENVIRONMENT 1.

Check batteries frequently. Keep a fire extinguisher on hand, know how to use it and refill it immediately after each use. Do not allow children in cooking areas without supervision. Teach them that there are areas of the facilities that are \"off-limits\" for play and exploration. Do not drink or carry anything hot near a child. Keep hot foods and drinks away from the edge of tables and counters. Do not leave them on a tablecloth that a child can grab. Use the rear burners for cooking. Turn the handles of pots towards the rear or center of the stove. Test hot food before giving it to a child. This includes food from a microwave oven. Never warm bottles in a microwave oven. Put barriers around fireplaces, radiators and hot pipes. Teach children to stay away from hot things and not to play with matches, lighters, chemicals and electric equipment. Plan a fire escape route and practice it. Train children how to properly respond to a fire (they should know the sound of a smoke alarm, two ways out of every room, how stop, drop and roll, etc.) Never use portable, open flame or space heaters. Use safety devices to cover electrical outlets. Avoid overloading electrical wiring. Lower the temperature of your hot water heater to 120\u00b0 F or lower. Always check the water temperature before placing your child in the tub. Supervise children in the tub. Store matches, lighters, chemicals and other hazardous items out of the reach of children. Check for fire and burn dangers, and make the necessary changes. Prevention of Injuries 2.25California's climate is changing. Heat waves are becoming more common, and the state is becoming warmer. (EPA, 2016) Infants and young children are especially vulnerable to heat-related illness. They become overheated and dehydrated more easily and may not have the words to describe how they are feeling. Preventing heat illness is part of keeping children safe while in your care. Follow these steps to keep children safe from heat illness: Plan outdoor activities during the cooler times of the day, such as early in the morning or later in the evening. Provide shade outside with umbrellas, shade-sails, sun-shelters, and/or trees. Schedule frequent water breaks to cool off and avoid dehydration. Choose clothing that is loose-fitting and light- colored. Observe children for signs of heat exhaustion including: An elevated body temperature Cool, clammy skin despite the heat Goose bumps Fainting, dizziness or weakness Headache Increased sweating Increased thirst Irritability Muscle cramps Nausea and/or vomiting Children may be at a higher risk for heat exhaustion if they have a sunburn or are sick. It's important to treat heat exhaustion immediately, as it can develop into heat stroke. Heat-related Illness Symptoms of Heat Stroke in Children Heat stroke is a severe type of heat illness that occurs when a child's body creates more heat than it can release. Heat stroke can lead to brain damage or death if not promptly treated. Heat stroke is a medical emergency. Signs of heat stroke in children may include: A body temperature that rises dangerously high - above 104 Fahrenheit Absence of sweating Confusion, disorientation Flushed, hot and dry skin (skin may be wet) Loss of consciousness Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Rapid heartbeat and breathing Severe headache Seizures Weakness and/or dizziness If a child shows symptoms of heat stroke, seek emergency medical treatment immediately. 2.26 California Childcare Health ProgramHEAT-RELATED ILLNESSES WHAT TO LOOK FOR HEAT STROKE High body temperature (103\u00b0F or higher) Hot, red, dry, or damp skin Fast, strong pulse Headache Dizziness Nausea Confusion Losing consciousness (passing out) HEAT EXHAUSTION Heavy sweating Cold, pale, and clammy skin Fast, weak pulse Nausea or vomiting Muscle cramps Tiredness or weakness Dizziness Headache Fainting (passing out) HEAT CRAMPS Heavy sweating during intense exercise Muscle pain or spasms SUNBURN Painful, red, and warm skin Blisters on the skin HEAT RASH Red clusters of small blisters that look like pimples on the skin (usually on the neck, chest, groin, or in elbow creases)WHAT TO DO Call 911 right away-heat stroke is a medical emergency Move the person to a cooler place Help lower the person's temperature with cool cloths or a cool bath Do not give the person anything to drink Move to a cool place Loosen your clothes Put cool, wet cloths on your body or take a cool bath Sip water Get medical help right away if: You are throwing up Your symptoms get worse Your symptoms last longer than 1 hour Stop physical activity and move to a cool place Drink water or a sports drink Wait for cramps to go away before you do any more physical activity Get medical help right away if: Cramps last longer than 1 hour You're on a low-sodium diet You have heart problems Stay out of the sun until your sunburn heals Put cool cloths on sunburned areas or take a cool bath Put moisturizing lotion on sunburned areas Do not break blisters Stay in a cool, dry place Keep the rash dry Use powder (like baby powder) to soothe the rash CS280226 Prevention of Injuries 2.27What a Child Care Provider Needs to Know Young children in their first three years of life are at greater risk of choking and suffocation. They may choke during meals or during playtime because they use their mouths to explore and experiment with unfamiliar objects. Some situations that are likely to lead to choking on food include eating while rushed, running and laughing. In the United States, death by choking, strangulation, suffocation or entrapment results in about 700 deaths each year to children and adolescents. Half of these deaths occur in the first year of life and three- quarters occur in children younger than five years. Food and coins are the most common causes of choking. Children have been strangled by clothing or string around their neck that becomes caught on furniture, playground equipment or some other object. Some consumer products that have strangled children include window-blind cords and the lids of toy chests. Entrapment and asphyxiation can occur in unsafe cribs as well as other household items such as refrigerators, ice chests and clothes dryers. Suffocation can occur if children have access to plastic bags. Choking and suffocation are frightening because they occur suddenly. Only six minutes without oxygen can cause brain damage in children. The signs of choking and suffocation in children are difficulty speaking or breathing, the inability to cough, wheezing sounds, clutching of throat or gesturing, a bluish face, confusion and unexplained loss of consciousness (this is a very late sign). Choking, Strangulation, and Suffocation What a Child Care Provider Can Do to Reduce This Type of Injury You can take the following steps to reduce the risk of mechanical airway obstruction: Learn the proper response and techniques for helping choking or suffocating infants and children. Foods that are round, hard, small, thick, sticky, smooth or slippery should not be offered to children younger than four years of age. For infants, foods should be cut in small pieces no longer than \u00bc\" cubes; for toddlers, pieces no longer than \u00bd\" cubes. Children should not be allowed to eat while walking, running, playing, lying down or riding in a vehicle. Objects smaller than 1 \u00bc\" in diameter should not be accessible to children who put things in their mouths. Check toys and equipment regularly for small parts that may break off, such as eyes and noses on stuffed animals, buttons on doll clothes or plastic hats or shoes on miniature people. Remove or securely attach these items. Plastic bags, pins, nails and toothpicks should not be accessible to children younger than four years. Only use cribs that meet current federal safety standards. Cribs sold after June 28, 2011 must meet these standards. Never place a crib near window blinds. No toys, blankets, bumpers, hanging toys, mobiles, or other objects should be in or on the crib. Secure or shorten window blind cords. Be aware of the needs and protections for children with developmental delays, swallowing or other disabilities. 2.28 California Childcare Health ProgramPOSSIBLE CHOKING AND SUFFOCATION HAZARDS Foods Big chunks of meat Whole olives Whole grapes and raisins Peanuts, nuts Gum Popcorn Hard candy and cough drops Raw vegetables (carrots, etc.) Hot dogs and sausages Watermelon seeds cut in rounds Spoons full of peanut butter Lollipops Dried fruit Toys Balloons Plastic bags Game pieces Play jewelry Game tokens Small objects Jacks Small toys (less than 1 1/2\") Marbles Toy chests with no air holes Objects Pins and nails Staples Toothpicks Coins Pencils and pens Jewelry Crayons Can you think of any more? Prevention of Injuries 2.29What a Child Care Provider Needs to Know Falls are the single greatest cause of injury in the child care environment and the most common injury requiring medical care. Thus, the prevention of falls will pose one of the greatest challenges to a safe environment. Although many injuries resulting from falls are minor (cuts and scrapes), many others such as heavy bleeding, broken bones, and head and eye injuries will be more severe and could be potentially life- threatening. The most common type of fall leading to hospitalization is a fall from one level to another, such as from playground equipment, beds, tables, chairs and stairs. Falls resulting in severe or fatal injuries are usually due to falls from second story (or higher) windows. Children are capable of falling or hurting themselves at any age. A tiny baby can wiggle, move and push. An older baby can roll over, crawl and creep. Toddlers can climb to get to places that were formerly inaccessible to them. Indoor furniture and playground equipment are frequently related to injuries from falls. Changing tables vary greatly and can be the cause of an infant's fall if the infant is left unattended. Although baby walkers are tested, they are the cause of more injuries than any other infant equipment. Injuries occur when young children in walkers fall down stairs or off porches. (Walkers are outlawed in child care.) What a Child Care Provider Can Do to Reduce Falls You know well, as a child care provider, that there is not much you can do to block the activity levels of children in your care. However, you can reduce the risk of injuries through control of the children's environment, by teaching appropriate behaviors (both indoors and outdoors) and by careful supervision. Falls Modification of equipment and environment: Use infant and child equipment that is in good repair, inspected for safety, and meets the needs of all children in your program. Use durable, balanced furniture that will not tip over easily. Get rid of baby walkers. Place safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs. Remove all objects from stairs. Make needed adjustments to the environment for children with mobility or other developmental needs. Keep windows screened and latched. Install window guards on upstairs windows. Pick up toys when play is finished. Pick up other objects from the floor and clean up spills quickly. Avoid highly waxed floors and stairways. Secure or remove loose mats and rugs. Use skid-proof mats or stickers in the bath. Keep the area well lit. Maintain safe playgrounds. The surface under and around play equipment where children can fall should be shock absorbent and soft (e.g., rubber, sand, pea gravel, or wood chips). Bring about a change of behavior through education and supervision: Do not allow children to climb on furniture, stools or ladders. Never leave toddlers and infants unattended on beds, on changing tables, or in play areas. Discourage indoor running. Teach children how to play safely, involve them in making rules for playground behavior, and enforce these rules consistently. Remove a misbehaving child from play, and explain how her or his actions could hurt someone. 2.30 California Childcare Health ProgramPOSTER California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.eduHOW TO HANDLE DENTAL INJURIESSTOP DENTAL DISEASE Apply ice or a cold pack to reduce swelling Place ice in a disposable glove or a small, closable plastic bag. Cover with a clean cloth to protect skin from extreme cold. Apply ice as tolerated for periods of 20 to 30 minutes. Child-appropriate pain relievers If recommended by the health care provider, give pain reliever, with written permission of the parent. Children's Tylenol or Children's Motrin can be used.If a fractured jaw or head injury is suspected Seek emergency care (call 9-1-1). Do not move the jaw.For a knocked out tooth If dirty, hold tooth by the crown and rinse root. Put tooth in whole milk, egg white, or coconut water. (If not available or if the child has an allergy, put the tooth in water or saliva.) Contact parent/guardian to take child and tooth to dentist immediately.Check the child's injury Remain calm. Put on disposable gloves. Rinse with water to clean out any debris. Clean the area around the injury. Rev. 06/2020 Prevention of Injuries 2.31What a Child Care Provider Needs to Know In the United States, about 2 million cases of exposure to poisons are reported each year. Children under six years of age are the most likely to get poisoned, with one- and two-year-olds most at risk. They are curious and will eat and drink almost anything\u2014even if it does not taste good. Although most poisoning occurs in the child's home, it can also occur in the child care setting. Poisons can be found in any room of the house or center, and poisonings can happen anywhere. However, most poisonings occur in the kitchen, bathroom or bedroom and in the presence of parents or providers, when products are not in their usual storage area and are in direct reach of young children. Poisonings occur from many common items found in a household or in the child care environment. Items that can be poisonous to a child include medicines (both prescription and non-prescription such as aspirin, cough and cold preparations, vitamins and iron), household cleaning products (such as furniture polishes, detergents and drain cleaners), substances stored in the garage (such as car and gardening products, herbicides, pesticides), mushrooms, plants (such as castor beans, foxglove and oleander), cosmetics, batteries, arts and crafts materials, and lead-containing paint, dust and pottery. Poisoning can occur by ingestion (eating or drinking), absorption (contact with skin, getting in the eyes), inhalation (breathing the fumes), injection (puncture wounds), and animal and insect bites. What a Child Care Provider Can Do to Reduce Poisoning Unintentional poisonings can be prevented. Methods of prevention include modification of the environment, education, and supervision. Poisoning, Lead Poisoning Modification of Environment Child care providers should make a room-by-room inspection and evaluate the outdoor play area for potential poisons in the child care environment. Removing all hazards and risks for exposure to poisons provides a protected environment. Poisons should be kept out of sight and reach of children, and in a locked cabinet. Remember what good climbers children can be! Parents and teachers should always put their purses, diaper bags, backpacks, etc. out of reach of the children. Create a special place for parents to place their items when they are just there for a short period. Store medications in their original childproof containers out of children's reach. Supervision Remember that no area is 100 percent safe. Good safety practices and supervision help prevent accidents involving poisoning. Adult supervision is the number one method of preventing poisonings among small children. Discourage children from mouthing paint brushes, crayons or other objects and materials. Never call medicine \"candy.\" Education Teach poison prevention to children and staff. Teach children never to put anything other than clean food into their mouths. Be Prepared Children act fast, and so do poisons. Even when people are very careful, poisoning exposures can occur. It is important to be prepared before something happens: 1. Attach the phone number of the Poison Center to the telephone (call 800-222-1222). 2. If a poisoning occurs, do not panic. Do not follow the first-aid procedures recommended on the product as they may be incorrect. If the child is in obvious distress, call 9-1-1 for help. Otherwise, call the Poison Center for advice and document the incident and your actions. Call the parent. 2.32 California Childcare Health Program1. Ingestion occurs by eating or drinking. Children are attracted to bright colorful packages, pills and odd shapes. They often mistake pills and vitamins for candy. Approximately 85 percent of poisonings occur through ingestion. 2. Absorption occurs when poisonous substances such as pesticides or plants come in contact with a person's skin or eyes. In this type of indirect poisoning, the poison is absorbed through the skin or mucous membrane into the blood stream. 3. Inhalation occurs when children breathe fumes from carbon monoxide, pesticides, certain types of art materials or dust that may contain lead. The air is exchanged in the lungs and comes in direct contact with the blood stream. WAYS IN WHICH POISONING CAN OCCUR 4. Animal and insect bites can cause an allergic reaction, but they can also be very toxic and can lead to death. These include ticks which cause Lyme disease or Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and reptiles such as rattlesnakes. 5. Injection occurs when there is a puncture wound. The danger may come from the substance that was injected or from the threat of tetanus. Today there is an extra threat of children finding needles that have been used to inject drugs. An incident like this can cause the child to be exposed to HIV , hepatitis B or other infections.

Courtesy of the California Poison Control System 2.34 California Childcare Health ProgramEach year, there are about 3,200 calls to U.S. Poison Control Centers about a button battery being swallowed. Nearly 6 out of 10 of these cases are for children under the age of 6. Many slim, sleek electronic devices have button battery compartments that are easy to open and most parents do not know there is a risk. If a child swallows a button battery, symptoms may be similar to other illnesses, such as coughing, drooling, and discomfort. Kids can usually breathe with the battery in their throat, making the problem hard to spot. National Battery Ingestion Hotline: 1-800-498-8666 Coin lithium button batteries can cause severe injuries when swallowed. There's a little-known risk to small children. Keep devices with button batteries out of reach if the battery compartments aren't secure, and lock away loose batteries. If a child swallows a button battery, go to the emergency room right away. Do not let the child eat or drink and do not induce vomiting. Share this information with other parents and caregivers. 1 2 3Inside small electronic devices may be very powerful coin-sized button batteries. When swallowed, these batteries can get stuck in the throat and cause severe burns or death. Prevention of Injuries 2.35Lead Poisoning Prevention Lead poisoning is one of the most common environmental illnesses among young children. Around 1 in 100 children under age 6 years old in California are found to have blood lead levels that could be harmful. (CDPH, 2015). Childhood lead poisoning can lead to problems with learning, behavior, and growth. YOUNG CHILDREN ARE AT RISK Young children are naturally curious. They explore by crawling around, touching, and putting toys and objects in their mouths. They spend a lot of time on the floor and ground where sources of lead may be found. Children absorb more lead than adults, and the toxic effects are greater because they are growing and developing. LEAD TESTING FOR CHILDREN Most children with lead poisoning do not look or act sick. Testing is the only way to know. Health care providers should assess young children for risk of lead exposure at every well-child visit up to age 6 years. Children with risk factors (for example, living in a building built before 1978 that has peeling or chipped paint or has recently been remodeled, or having recently moved from a country with high levels of environmental lead) should have a blood test. Publicly funded programs for low-income children (for example, Medi-Cal, Child Health and Disability Prevention Program (CHDP), Head Start, WIC) are required to test children for lead at 1 and 2 years old. HOW YOU CAN HELP PROTECT CHILDREN FROM LEAD Prevention is the most important way to protect children from lead poisoning. The following steps help to protect children from lead poisoning: Raise awareness Child care providers are required to give enrolling families written information about childhood lead poisoning, including the risks and effects of lead exposure and options for blood lead testing. A brochure with this information is available on the Community Care Licensing (CCL) website or by calling your regional CCL office. Encourage families to ask their child's health care provider about lead screening and testing. Educational posters, flyers, and brochures are also available in many languages on the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) website.Reduce exposure. Eliminate possible sources of lead: Lead-based paint in homes built before 1978, especially if it is chipping, peeling, or generating dust from friction caused by opening windows and doors Vinyl mini-blinds Bare dirt Artificial play surfaces, including turf and rubber mulch Water from wells or running through plumbing that contains lead Old painted toys, old vinyl toys, or toys imported from outside the USA Some foods, including candy, spices, and seasonings, imported from outside the USA Some home remedies, make-up, and jewelry Some handmade or imported pottery*, dishes, and water crocks Lead brought home on clothes and shoes by parents who may be exposed at work Some hobbies such as making stained glass (lead solder), hunting or firing ranges (lead bullets), or fishing (lead sinkers) Property near busy highways and some industries *Test kits for pottery are available in hardware stores. Provide good nutrition Anemia and lead poisoning may occur together. Feed children healthy meals and snacks on a regular basis. See Module 3 for more information on healthy nutrition for young children. Use lead-safe toys Only use toys that are safe for children. Check toys for chipping paint and do not use old or imported toys unless you know they do not contain lead. You can check the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) for toys that have been recalled: www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/ . Also, do not let young children play with keys, as they may contain lead. Use the Lead Poisoning Prevention Checklist on page 2.68 to perform monthly inspections for sources of lead. Wash children's hands Hands can carry germs and other harmful substances, like lead dust, to children's mouths. See pages 1.19 for detailed instruction on when and how to wash children's hands. Children who self-soothe by sucking fingers and thumbs may need to wash their hands more often and when going to sleep (nap and bedtime). 2.36 California Childcare Health ProgramProvide safe drinking water Most tap water in California does not contain lead. However, testing your water is the only way to be sure that tap water is free from lead. See Module 1 for more information on drinking water safety. Licensed child care programs in buildings built before 2010 need to have their tap water tested for lead between January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2023, and every five years thereafter. Centers must also inform parents of testing results. You can reduce potential exposure to lead in tap water by: Flushing the pipes in your home or center. Run water until it feels coldest, usually at least 30 seconds and up to a few minutes. This may take longer if the taps have been off for 6 or more hours. Using only cold tap water for cooking, drinking, and mixing baby formula (if used as an alternative to breastfeeding). If using a water filter, be sure to use an NSF- certified filter that removes lead. Change water filter according to manufacturer's instructions. Paint, repair, and remodel your facility safely If your child care facility was built before 1978, there is a risk for contamination when painting, repairing, or remodeling. The EPA's Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) rule requires renovations of child- occupied facilities to be carried out by Lead-Safe Certified contractors with special training in lead- safe work practices. This ensures renovations do not expose children to harmful lead dust. Facilities with play yards exposed to heavy automobile traffic or located near an industrial area where lead products have been used or produced may also expose children to lead. In this case, have your facility evaluated by a lead-certified inspector. A list of lead certified contractors and inspectors is available on the CDPH website. Contact your local Lead Poisoning Prevention Program at your local Public Health Department for further information about lead inspections, including testing the soil, paint, and any old artificial turf at your facility. Clean surfaces Damp mop your floors and wipe down furniture, window sills, and other surfaces with a damp cloth regularly. Wash toys regularly. See Module 1 for detailed information on cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting.Resources Local Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program: ( ) (Instructors should customize this section by placing their local Lead Poisoning Prevention Program telephone number here.)

Symptoms, if any, may be confused with common childhood complaints, such as stomachache, crankiness, headaches, or loss of appetite. A blood lead test is free if you have Medi-Cal or if you are in the Child Health and Disability Prevention Program (CHDP). Children on Medi-Cal, CHDP, Head Start, WIC, or at risk for lead poisoning, should be tested at age 1 and 2. Health insurance plans will also pay for this test. Ask your child's doctor about blood lead testing.

(The information and images found on this publication are adapted from the California Department of Public Health Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program.) 1/2019 EFFECTS OF LEAD EXPOSURE Children 1-6 years old are the most at risk for lead poisoning. Lead poisoning can harm a child's nervous system and brain when they are still forming, causing learning and behavior problems that may last a lifetime. Lead can lead to a low blood count (anemia). Even small amounts of lead in the body can make it hard for children to learn, pay attention, and succeed in school. Higher amounts of lead exposure can damage the nervous system, kidneys, and other major organs. Very high exposure can lead to seizures or death. IN THE US: LEAD IN TAP WATER WARNING! LEAD POISONING FACTS Buildup of lead in the body is referred to as lead poisoning. Lead is a naturally occurring metal that has been used in many products and is harmful to the human body. There is no known safe level of lead in the body. Small amounts of lead in the body can c ause lifelong learning and behavior problems. Lead poisoning is one of the -most common environmental illnesses in California children. The United States has taken many steps to remove sources of lead, but lead is still around us. Lead in house paint was severely reduced in 1978. Lead solder in food cans was banned in the 1980s. Lead in gasoline was removed in the early 1990s. The only way to know if tap water has lead is to have it tested. Tap water is more likely to have lead if: Plumbing materials, including fixtures, solder (used for joining metals), or service lines have lead in them; Water does not come from a public water system (e.g., a private well). To reduce any potential exposure to lead in tap water: Flush the pipes in your home Let water run at least 30 seconds before using it for cooking, drinking, or baby formula (if used). If water has not been used for 6 hours or longer, let water run until it feels cold (1 to 5 minutes.)* Use only cold tap water for cooking, drinking, or baby formula (if used) If water needs to be heated, use cold water and heat on stove or in microwave. Care for your plumbing Lead solder should not be used for plumbing work. Periodically remove faucet strainers and run water for 3-5 minutes.* Filter your water-Consider using a water filter certified to remove lead. Some water crocks have lead. Do not give a child water from a water crock unless you know the crock does not have lead. (*Water saving tip: Collect your run- ning water and use it to water plants not intended for eating.) For information on testing your water for lead, visit The Environmental Pro- tection Agency at www.epa.gov/lead/ protect-your-family-exposures-lead or call (800) 426-4791.

Water safety presents a particular challenge to California child care providers. Most drownings in this age group occur in home swimming pools. Water-filled bathtubs, wading pools, toilets, buckets or other containers are also places where young children can drown. Children between the ages of one and four years are at greatest risk from drowning. These children are just learning to walk and explore. They excel at getting out from under the watchful eye of the provider. Small children are top-heavy; they tend to fall forward and head first when they lose their balance. They do not have enough muscle development in their upper body to pull themselves up out of a bucket, toilet or bathtub, or for that matter, any body of water. Even a bucket containing only a few inches of water can be dangerous for a small child. Wading in bodies of fresh water may carry the additional risk of injury from cuts, puncture wounds and infections. Standing bodies of water such as swimming pools, wading pools and hot tubs also have the potential for spreading disease, so they are not recommended for use with young children. Instead, the use of sprinklers is recommended. Drowning What a Child Care Provider Can Do to Reduce the Risk of Drowning Reduce water hazards and prevent access to water. Safety precautions must be taken to keep any water in the child care environment as risk-free as possible. Since any body of water poses a threat and young children can drown in as little as one inch of water, the outdoor environment should be thoroughly screened to detect hazards that may lead to the risk of drowning. Promote safe behaviors. Children themselves pose a threat when a body of water is present in the outdoor environment. They move fast, are curious and do not understand their physical abilities. The majority of drownings occur within a surprisingly short period of time. Never, ever, leave a child alone, even for a moment, when there is a body of water in the outdoor environment. When outdoors and near the water, always reinforce safety for the children. If the children are allowed to play in water, plan this activity for the time when they are the least tired and the most alert. Teach children safe practices for swimming and playing in the water to further protect them. Have a telephone with in easy reach at all times. Never leave the area when children are present for a moment, even to answer the phone. Prevention of Injuries 2.39Never leave a child alone in or near any body of water (tub, wading pools, shower, pool or even a bucket). Latch toilet-seat covers down when not in use. Always provide careful, direct and constant supervision of young children if there is a body of water present in the outdoor environment. Never expect swimming instruction to eliminate the risk of drowning in children. Supervise children in the water even if they are wearing flotation devices. These devices are not substitutes for constant supervision. Any hazard should be enclosed with a fence that is at least five feet tall and difficult to climb. A door or sliding-glass door is not a safe substitute for a fence. Gates should have locks that are at least 55\" high and self-closing. Keep gate keys in a safe place away from children. Never leave pool covers partially in place because children can become trapped beneath them. Pool covers are not a substitute for fencing. Keep chairs, tables and climbing equipment away from pool fences to prevent children from climbing over the fence into the pool. Learn CPR and keep rescue equipment at poolside, including a life preserver, shepherd's crook and cordless telephone. If a portable wading pool is used in child care (although it is not recommended), it should be filled with water, used immediately and drained and put away as soon as children leave the pool. Never leave infants or children unattended around five-gallon buckets containing even a small amount of liquid. Empty all buckets when not in use. Children with seizure disorders are particularly vulnerable to drowning. Know your children's medical history. Teach your children water safety behaviors (e.g., not to run, push or play around swimming areas; not to bring glass or bottles near swimming or wading areas; not to swim with anything in their mouths; not to swim in very cold water because it increases the risk of drowning; to be on the lookout for other children who might be in danger; not to go near a pool unless supervised; not to scream for help unless they mean it; not to roughhouse or fool around in water, etc.). Keep in mind that young children who have had swimming lessons are more at risk because of over- confidence. PREVENTING DROWNINGS 2.40 California Childcare Health ProgramDisasters and Trauma After experiencing a disaster\u2014whether it is a flood, earthquake, fire, or human caused event, children may react in ways that are difficult to understand. Even if children are not physically injured, the emotional response can be strong. They may act clingy, irritable or distant, and although they are very young and do not seem to understand what is going on, they are affected as much as adults. Adult fears and anxieties are communicated to children in many ways. The experience is more difficult for them, as they do not understand the connection between the disaster and all the upheaval that follows. They need reassurance that everything is all right. There is a wide range of \"normal\" reactions for children following a disaster, most of which can be handled with extra support at home, child care and school. In some cases, professional intervention may be needed, despite everyone's best efforts. Early intervention can help a child avoid more severe problems. Message to Parents Some ways to provide reassurance after a disaster are: Try to remain calm. Remember the effect and anxiety produced by watching television coverage or listening to the radio. Keep TV/radio/adult conversations about the disaster at a minimum around young children. Spend extra time being close to your child(ren). Answer all questions as honestly and simply as possible. Be prepared to answer the same questions over and over. Children need reassurance to master their fears. Spend extra time with your child at bedtime\u2014 soothing and relaxing time\u2014talking, reading or singing quietly. Spend extra time with your child when bringing them to child care\u2014they may be afraid you will not come back. Try to return to a normal routine as soon as possible to restore a sense of normalcy and security. Young Children and Disasters Don't promise there won't be another disaster. Instead, encourage children to talk about their fears and what they can do to help in case of disaster. Tell them you will do everything you can to keep them safe. Be patient and understanding if your child is having difficulties. Never use threats. Saying, \"If you don't behave an earthquake will swallow you up,\" will only add to the fear and not help your child behave more acceptably. Consider how you and your child can help. Children are better able to regain their sense of security if they can help in some way. Share your concerns with your child's teacher or child care provider. Consider assistance from professionals trained to work with disaster victims. Message to Child Care Providers You can be a support and resource to parents by helping them understand behavioral and emotional responses. Be sensitive to how parents feel when they are separated from their children in a disaster. It may be very helpful for parents, children and you to take some extra time when dropping off children in the morning. A group meeting to reassure parents, discuss your response to their children's reactions, and review your emergency plan will help everyone feel more secure. Help children cope by talking about their fears so they can master them. Talk about being afraid, and practice what you will do the next time a disaster strikes. Because young children think the world revolves around them, children may need reassurance that they did not cause the disaster. Consider referring a family for professional help if any of the behaviors on the following page persists two to four weeks after the disaster. Children who have lost family members or friends, or who were physically injured or felt they were in life- threatening danger, are at special risk for emotional disturbance. Children who have been in previous disasters or who are involved in a family crisis may also have more difficulty coping. Prevention of Injuries 2.41Regressive ReactionsEmotional/Behavioral ReactionsPhysiological How to Help Increased competition with younger siblings Excessive clinging Crying or whimpering Wanting to be fed or dressed Engaging in habits they had previously given upSchool phobia Withdrawal from play group and friends Withdrawal from family contacts Irritability Uncooperative Fear of wind, rain, etc. Inability to concentrate and drop in level of school achievement Aggressive behavior Repetitive talking about their experiences Sadness over losses Overreaction to crises or changes in the environmentHeadaches Complaints of visual or hearing problems Persistent itching and scratching Nausea Sleep disturbance, nightmares, night terrorsGive additional attention and ample physical comforting. Insist gently but firmly that the child accept more responsibility than younger siblings; positively reinforce age- appropriate behavior. Reduce pressure on the child to perform at his or her best in school and while doing chores at home. Reassure the child that his competence will return. Provide structured but not demanding chores and responsibilities. Encourage physical activity. Encourage verbal and written expression of thoughts and feelings about the disaster; encourage the child to grieve the loss of pets or toys. Schedule play sessions with adults and peers. TYPICAL REACTIONS OF CHILDREN FOLLOWING DISASTER Regressive ReactionsEmotional/Behavioral ReactionsPhysiological How to Help Bedwetting Thumbsucking Fear of darkness Fear of animals Fear of \"monsters\" Fear of strangers Nervousness Irritability Uncooperative Hyperactivity Tics Speech difficulties Anxiety about separation from parents Shorter attention span Aggressive behavior Exaggeration or distortion of disaster experience Repetitive talking about experiences Exaggeration of behavior problemsLoss of appetite Overeating Indigestion Vomiting Bowel or bladder problems Sleep disorders and nightmaresGive additional verbal assurance and ample physical comforting. Provide comforting bedtime routines. Permit the child to sleep in the parents' room on a temporary basis. Encourage expression of emotions through play activities including drawing, dramatic play, or telling stories about the experience. Resume normal routines as soon as possible. Children Ages 1 to 5: Children in this age group are particularly vulnerable to changes in their routines and disruption of their environments. Dependent on family members for comfort, they may be affected as much by the reactions of family members as by the disaster. Focus on reestablishing comforting routines, providing opportunity for nonverbal and verbal expression of feelings, and reassurance. Children Ages 5 to 11: Regressive behaviors are especially common in this age group. Children may become more withdrawn or more aggressive. They might be particularly affected by the loss of prized objects or pets. Encourage verbalization and play enactment of their experiences. While routines might be temporarily relaxed, the goal should be to resume normal routines as soon possible. 2.42 California Childcare Health ProgramPOSTER California Car Seat Law Changes EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017 NEW A DDITION Starting January 1, 2017, children under 2 years old must be rear facing unless they weigh 40 pounds or more, or are 40 inches tall or more. Most children will outgrow an infant seat before age 1 The next step is a convertible car seat. Rear facing is 5 times safer than forward facing. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children ride rear facing to the highest weight or height allowed by the car seat manufacturer.CURRENT LAW Children under age 8 must be buckled into a car seat or booster in the back seat. Children age 8 or older, or who are 4'9\" or taller, may use the vehicle seat belt if it fits properly with the lap belt low on the hips, touching the upper thighs, and the shoulder belt crossing the center of the chest. If children are not tall enough for proper belt fit, they must ride in a booster or car seat. Everyone in the car must be properly buckled up. Kaitlyn's Law It's against California law to leave a child who is 6 years of age or younger alone in the car without the supervision of a person at least 12 years old if: 1.The keys are in the ignition or the car is running, or 2.There is a significant risk to the child. Keep your children safe. It's the law! FINES & PENA LTIES For each child under 16 who is not properly secu red, parents (if in the car) or drivers can be fined more than $500 and get a point on their driving records.

And make sure to keep your car locked when you're not inside so kids don't get in on their own. C: Create reminders. Keep a stuffed animal or other memento in your child's car seat when it's empty, and move it to the front seat as a visual reminder when your child is in the back seat. Or place and secure your phone, briefcase or purse in the backseat when traveling with your child. T: Take action. If you see a child alone in a car, call 911. Emergency personnel want you to call. They are trained to respond to these situations. One call could save a life.Teach Kids Not to Play in Cars Make sure to lock your vehicle (doors and the trunk) when you're away from it. Keep keys and remote entry fobs out of children's sight and reach. Teach kids that trunks are for transporting cargo and are not safe places to play. If your child is missing, immediately check swimming pools, vehicles and trunks. Get kids who are locked in cars out as soon as possible. If you can't do so quickly, dial 911 right away. Emergency personnel are trained to evaluate and check for signs of heatstroke. Go a Step Further: Create Extra Reminders and Communicate with your Child Care Provider If you regularly drop your child off at child care, create a calendar reminder on your phone or computer to make sure you've done so. Make arrangements for your child care provider to call you right away if your child doesn't show up at the expected time. Be especially careful if you change your routine for dropping off children at child care. Heatstroke incidents often occur when people's routine is disrupted. Everything you need to know to keep your kids safe from heatstroke.Heatstroke Safety Tips Sometimes babies sleep so peacefully that busy parents can forget they are even there. Other times, we might be tempted to leave kids in the car while we run into the store or dash off to do an errand. Children can also end up alone in cars if the doors or trunk are left unlocked. However it happens, 37 kids die each year from being unattended in a vehicle. That's why children should never be alone in a car. It can lead to heatstroke, which causes serious injury or even death. Young children are particularly at risk since their bodies heat up three to five times faster than an adult's. Here's how we can work together to keep this preventable tragedy from happening. Heatstroke is the leading cause of non- crash, vehicle-related deaths for children. On average, every 10 days a child dies from heatstroke in a vehicle. 2.44 California Childcare Health ProgramPOSTER POSTER For more information visit safekids.org. \u00a9 2013 Safe Kids Worldwide\u00ae Make sure to lock your vehicle, including doors and trunk, when you're not using it.

When checking for kids around your vehicle, see if anything that could attract a child such as a pet, bike or toy, is under or behind your vehicle before getting in and starting the engine. Designate an adult to supervise and find a safe spot for children to wait when nearby vehicles are about to move and make sure the drivers can see them. Limit Play in the Driveway Work with your kids to pick up toys, bikes, chalk or any type of equipment around the driveway so that these items don't entice kids to play. Identify and use safe play areas for children, away from parked or moving vehicles. Teach kids to play in these areas instead of in, around or behind a car. Consider making your driveway a toy-free zone. Don't allow children to play unattended in parking lots when cars are present.Lend a Hand to Younger Kids Accompany little kids when they get in and out of a vehicle. Hold their hands while walking near moving vehicles or in driveways and parking lots or on sidewalks.Everything you need to know to keep your kids safe around driveways.Driveway Safety Tips Kids love cars, and when they see a parked car, they don't even think about the possibility of getting hurt or seriously injured. That's why parents have to. Many preventable injuries and deaths occur in driveways or parking lots when drivers are unaware that children are near vehicles. Tragically, these drivers are often family members or friends of the injured child. But these injuries are easily prevented by following a few simple tips. Each year, more than 9,000 children are treated in emergency rooms for injuries that occurred while they were unattended in or around motor vehicles. 2.46 California Childcare Health ProgramTaking a day trip with young children can provide wonderful learning opportunities to enrich and extend your curriculum\u2014but day trips are not for the faint of heart! However, with careful planning, adequate staffing, and a spirit of adventure, adults and children can safely enjoy outings. Below is important information to consider when planning and making field trips with young children. Research Your Destination Before You Take a Trip Before selecting a field trip site, providers/teachers should consider why they are taking children on this field trip. Is this an activity that can only take place away from the child care program, such as a visit to a children's theater? Or could this experience occur just as well at the program site? For example, if you want children to learn about firefighters, you can visit the local fire station or instead you might ask your local fire department to come to your site with their equipment and a firetruck. Be sure the destination you have chosen is safe and appropriate for young children. If possible, visit the site in advance of announcing the trip. Look at the site from a safety perspective, such as potential falls, entrapments, and choking/poisoning hazards. Remember, destinations such as parks, zoos, or landmarks are usually not \"childproofed.\" Talk to others who have visited already, preferably those who have gone there with young children. Find out if there are accessible restrooms and a supply of running water. What are the best times to visit to avoid large crowds? Are there generally many other groups of children at the same time? Are there hazards such as unfenced bodies of water, loose animals, poisonous plants, or stairs without secure railings? Does the trip require a long walk through a parking lot or along a busy street? Gathering this type of information ahead of time will help you choose an appropriate destination. Field Trip Safety Obtain Written Consent for Each Participating Child A permission slip specific to the trip should be distributed to families ahead of time, to be completed by the parents or guardians. The permission slip should include details about the trip, the date on which it will occur, the destination and its address, the mode(s) of transportation to be used, and the estimated times of the group's departure and return. In addition to permission to attend, the permission slip should also include consent for emergency care if required during the trip. Parents must provide contact information so that the parent or a designated contact can be reached immediately to assume responsibility in the event of an emergency. Make sure the information you take with you is current. Only children whose parents have signed and returned a permission slip should participate. Maintain Staffing Requirements During travel and at your destination, maintain the appropriate ratio of staff to children at all times. Parents should be welcome, and having additional adults around will certainly make the logistics of travel easier. However, parent participation must comply with current licensing regulations, and parent volunteers are not to be counted as substitutes for trained child care staff. Use Child Safety Restraints If your trip requires traveling in cars or vans, each participating child must travel in a car safety seat or booster that is appropriate for their age and weight. Preferably, parents will provide a seat that is already set up to fit the child to minimize the amount of time spent fidgeting and adjusting straps and buckles on the day of the trip. Older children should buckle the lap belt and shoulder belt. Never double-buckle children in seat belts; each child should have his or her own seat belt to provide the best possible protection. Prevention of Injuries 2.47Bring Important Health and Safety Materials with You Assemble a first aid kit and designate one staff member to carry it in a backpack or fanny pack. Contents should include: Disposable nonporous gloves Adhesive bandages of assorted shapes/sizes Gauze pads/rolls and bandage tape Scissors and tweezers Thermometer (not made of glass) Eye dressing Cold pack Bottled water Sunscreen Small splints Soap or disposable hand wipes Plastic bags for disposal of soiled materials A simple first aid guide or chart Any emergency medications potentially needed by participants List of emergency phone numbers, parent contact information, and poison control numbers A functional cell phone or coins for pay phones A pen or pencil and a small notepad, for taking down emergency notes or instructions In addition, carry with you the care plans describing any special health needs of participating children. For example, if a participating child has asthma, the kit should contain the care plan as well as any medications or equipment he or she may need. Transport medications in a back pack, and keep them at the appropriate temperature. Check medications for special storage instructions (for example, does it need to be refrigerated or kept out of sunlight?). Ice packs may be used if medications need to be kept cool. Do not leave medications in vehicles as they can reach high temperatures in a short time. Plan for Safe and Nutritious Food If your trip will include a meal or snack, be sure to prepare food safely. Perishable items are generally not practical, since they require refrigeration or packing in ice. If the destination doesn't offer drinking fountains, participants will need to carry water to drink to prevent dehydration. The ability of children to carry their own backpacks or lunch sacks will depend on their ages and developmental levels. At the very least, for a short trip, a nutritious snack should be carried by the adults and distributed to the children at an appropriate time. Maintain Basic Hygiene Practice hand washing prior to eating, even when you are away from your site. It may be necessary to carry hand sanitizer to accomplish this, if there is no access to clean running water on your trip. Identifying Labels and Apparel Identify the children in your group with a special sticker, or even matching tee-shirts. Ready visual identification of the children in your group is especially helpful where there are many groups of young children present. Bring a Roster Sheet of Participants Bring a roster sheet of participants. An accurate list of children who have been signed in on the day of the trip is crucial. Use this list to conduct frequent exact head counts. Count the children as you leave the program, once they are in the vehicle(s), as they exit the vehicle(s), and when they get into the designated building or area. The roster should also allow for a parent or designated contact to sign out a child during the trip, if necessary. 2.48 California Childcare Health ProgramPOSTERPOSTER For more information visit safekids.org. \u00a9 2015 Safe Kids Worldwide\u00ae Walk with your kids to the bus stop and wait with them until it arrives. Tell kids to stand at least three giant steps back from the curb as the bus approaches and board the bus one at a time. Teach kids to wait for the bus to come to a complete stop before getting off and never to walk behind the bus. If your child needs to cross the street after exiting the bus, he or she should take five giant steps in front of the bus, make eye contact with the bus driver and cross when the driver indicates it's safe. Teach kids to look left, right and left again before crossing the street. Instruct younger kids to use handrails when boarding or exiting the bus. Be careful of straps or drawstrings that could get caught in the door. If your children drop something, they should tell the bus driver and make sure the bus driver is able to see them before they pick it up. Drivers should always follow the speed limit and slow down in school zones and near bus stops. Remember to stay alert and look for kids who may be trying to get to or from the school bus. Slow down and stop if you're driving near a school bus that is flashing yellow or red lights. This means the bus is either preparing to stop (yellow) or already stopped (red), and children are getting on or off.Everything you need to know to keep your kids safe in and around the school bus.School Bus Safety Tips Taking the bus for the first time is a big step for your child.

Providers need to exercise and practice good body mechanics to stay healthy. Dr. Rene Gratz and her colleagues studied the health risk factors associated with the child care work site and put together the following list of the top eight health risk problems: 1. Incorrect lifting of children, toys, and equipment. 2. Inadequate work heights (e.g., child-sized tables and chairs) 3. Lowering and lifting in and out of cribs 4. Frequent sitting on the floor with back unsupported 5. Excessive reaching above shoulder height to obtain stored supplies 6. Frequent lifting of children on and off the diaper changing tables 7 . Awkward positions and forceful motions needed to open windows 8. Carrying garbage diaper bags to dumpster What a Child Care Provider Can Do to Reduce Back Injury You can prevent back injury in the following ways: Learn proper lifting and carrying techniques, such as keeping the child as close as possible to you and avoiding any twisting motion as you lift the child. Encourage independence in children\u2014for example, walk up stairs with toddlers, rather than carrying them. Use adult furniture, not child-sized chairs, tables or desks. Use sit/kneel chairs. Always use proper body mechanics when lifting. Sit up against a wall or furniture for back support when possible. Perform stretching exercises. Redesign the kitchen area so that the heaviest items are at waist height. Reorganize snacks and supplies to simplify procedures for preparation of snacks. Use step stools when retrieving items above cupboard height. Use adult-height changing tables. Use a ramp or small, stable stepladders or stairs to allow children, with constant supervision, to climb up to changing tables or other places to which they would be lifted. Use step stools for better leverage. Have maintenance staff improve the quality of window slides. Use a cart to transport trash, and relocate the garbage cart closer to the work area. Reduce the size and weight of loads. MODULE 2 / SECTION 3 Safety Policies and Routines Back Injury Among Providers 2.50 California Childcare Health ProgramEach room and area of your child care facility contains potential hazards. Sometimes hazards are not obvious to the untrained eye, but children always find them. Examining the indoor and outdoor environments for safety hazards allows the child care provider to offer protection for the children and prevent unnecessary accidents. When we modify an environment for increased safety, we call it \"childproofing.\" In your facility, many environmental changes can and do occur almost daily\u2014new children enter, others leave, you purchase new furniture and equipment, bring in pets, seasons change. Every change in your facility's environment should initiate an evaluation to see if it is safe and effective. This process is called \"monitoring.\" The indoor child care environment can include many physical hazards that pose risks through choking, poisoning, burns, falls, and other ways. Many of you control environmental hazards in your facility by instinct, but monitoring your facility for safety should be a deliberate and serious task. One way to accomplish this is by regularly using your safety checklists to insure that your environment is still childproof. Remember: childproofing a room does not make that room 100 percent safe! Regular Safety Checks Inside and Outside Childproofing Does Not Replace Supervision \u2014 It Enhances It Your program must follow certain safety standards and practices in order to be licensed. Local building, sanitary, and fire safety codes must also be observed. You can create a safe environment by carefully following these additional guidelines: Know the licensing regulations for your child care setting. Know all applicable safety practices for the child care environment (such as not shaking a baby, always checking water temperature, putting babies on their back to sleep, keeping hot food and liquids out of reach). Be alert to hazards both indoors and outdoors, and eliminate or avoid them. Use safety devices where applicable (e.g., smoke alarms and safety guards around hot surfaces). Use a checklist to conduct safety checks of outdoor areas, indoor areas, and first aid kits on a regularly scheduled basis. Some features need to be checked daily, others weekly or monthly. Programs need to build safety checks into their daily, weekly, and monthly schedules. Encourage all staff to participate in conducting the checks and in the planning of ways to deal with hazards. Be aware of conditions that contribute to injuries. Whenever a hazard is found, fix it if you can. If you cannot fix it, make a note of it and follow up with plans to get it fixed. Know what you are buying or what is being donated to your program. Read labels and instructions carefully. If you have any questions or complaints about the safety of any product, call the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) at (800) 638-2772.

(Fill in your limit.) Everybody starts at the same end and goes in the same direction. Use a lock grip (fingers and thumbs). Keep a big space between you and the person in front. Do not use when wet or hot. Drop down with knees bent. Try to land on both feet. Safe Playground Habits 2.54 California Childcare Health ProgramBecause of developmental factors that limit children's physical, mental and emotional abilities, they may lack the capacity to judge whether or not an activity is safe. It is the responsibility of child care providers to provide children with a safe environment and to ensure their well-being and protection. Safety policies for modifying the environment, modifying behavior, monitoring children and teaching injury- preventive behaviors to children will help the provider offer more safety protection and prevention in every child care situation. The action of a child is the most common behavior leading to injury. The majority of behaviors displayed by a child are related to his or her developmental level. The adult behavior that can contribute to a child's injury can be active (such as child abuse or violence) or inactive (such as lack of supervision, knowledge, and communication). In designing safety policies, understand the safety hazards in the child care environment and know what hazards are addressed by local licensing regulations and fire prevention boards. Providers need to check both inside and outside for hazards while applying special safety considerations to small children. Viewing the environment through the eyes of a child will help the provider find safety hazards and create safety checklists that offer maximum protection. Get down at the child's level so that you can see what the child sees. Safety Policies and Behavior Management Each type of safety hazard should have steps to follow to avoid risk. For example, if a field trip is scheduled, there should be a definite policy for travel with children. This would include trip planning and preparation, assuring enough adults for proper supervision, and procedures to follow during the trip and at its completion. It is essential to have knowledge of the developmental abilities of the children in child care. The abilities of the children will affect the types of safety policies. These policies should be clearly written, based on standard safety practices and licensing regulations, specific to the hazard involved, and applicable to the specific child care environment. Additionally, if the child has a disability or other special need, such as behavior issues, there should be a special care plan on file. Safety policies include guidelines, checklists and charts that help to protect the child care environment from hazards. These policies will guide the child care providers in methods of practicing safety and should name the person who is responsible for carrying out the safety process that is developed. The guidelines should address the areas where risks are anticipated, and how the environment should be modified and monitored for safety. Be sure to consider children who have sight or mobility restrictions. Be a positive role model: keep in mind that your own attitudes and behaviors are as important as the physical environment of your facility. Role modeling should reflect the behaviors the child care provider wishes to pass on to the children. Education and supervision also help providers maintain a safe child care environment. Prevention of Injuries 2.55To prevent injuries in the child care setting, a safety policy and plan should be implemented. Examples of Safe Practices that Can Be Used for Safety Policies Explaining safety actions to the children Practicing safe activities in the child care and community environment Using safety devices such as smoke alarms and electrical outlet plugs Being sensitive to unsafe conditions Having daily routines for safety checks Removing hazards to ensure a safe physical environment Educating oneself on safety issues and practices Communicating with parents about safety measures Teaching what to do in an emergency and clarifying the provider's safety behavior during practice drills and role-play Using special care plans for children with disabilities, behavior issues, and/or special health care needs. 2.56 California Childcare Health ProgramForms and Checklists Injury Report Form ................................................................................................. 2.62 LIC-610 Emergency Disaster Plan for Child Care Centers ................................ 2.63 LIC-610A Emergency Disaster Plan for Family Child Care Homes ................ 2.64 LIC 624B Unusual Incident/Injury Report - Family Child Care Home ......... 2.65 LIC 624 Unusual Incident/Injury Report ............................................................ 2.67 LIC 700 Identification and Emergency Information .......................................... 2.69 Lead Poisoning Prevention Checklist .................................................................. 2.70 Health and Safety Checklist for Early Care and Education ............................ 2.71 Prevention of Injuries 2.57xii Prevention of InjuriesInjury Report Form Fill in all blanks and boxes that apply Name of Program: or ed Noti ed Time Noti ed: ______:______ am/pm Location where incident occurred: playground classroom bathroom hall kitchen doorway large muscle room or gym of ce dining room unknown other (specify) _______________________ Equipment/product involved: climber slide swing playground surface sandbox trike/bike hand toy (specify): ____________________________________________________________________________________________ other equipment (specify): injur y: fall to height of fall _________ feet;

If yes, have the paint tested. Is the paint in poor condition? Check often for cracked, damaged, or peeling paint in the interior and exterior of your structure. Check the windows, stairs, doorways, floors, and porches. Move cribs and other furniture away from the walls and other possible sources of lead. If yes, choose painting contractors who follow lead-safety practices. Has your property (built before 1978) been recently painted or renovated? If yes, children may be at risk for lead exposure from dust and paint chips. Will your property (built before 1978) be renovated soon? If yes, choose contractors who follow lead-safety practices. Was your facility built before 1986? Pipes in buildings built before 1986 are more likely to have pipes, solder, or fixtures that contain lead. If yes: Consider replacing older brass fixtures with new ones that meet the January 1, 2010, requirements. Items that carry the NSF 61, Annex G designation meet this designation. Let your water run until it feels coldest (usually 30 seconds to a few minutes depending on how long the water has been sitting in the pipes) before use to get any potential lead out. Use only cold water from the tap to cook with, drink, or mix with infant formula. Is the property near a busy roadside that may have been contaminated with leaded gasoline emitted by cars? If yes, Don't let children play on bare soil. Plant grass, shrubs or other ground cover to prevent direct contact with the soil. Remove shoes when coming inside. Does your property have bare soil? If yes, Don't let children play on bare soil. Plant grass, shrubs or other ground cover to prevent direct contact with the soil. Remove shoes when coming inside. Does the property have lead dust? Check high friction areas like windows and doors. If yes, clean floors and window sills often with soap and water and then rinse with fresh water. Wash children's hands before and after eating, after playing outside and before napping. Do you have older imported vinyl mini-blinds? If yes, remove them or have them tested to make sure they don't contain lead. Do you own imported or homemade china or ceramic dishware or water crocks? If yes, have it tested to make sure it does not contain lead. Do you have painted or plastic furniture or toys from an unknown origin? If yes, have them tested to make sure they are lead-free. Don't let children chew on painted furniture or toys. 2.66 California Childcare Health Program1 \u00a9 2014 California Childcare Health Program, UCSF School of Nursing cchp.ucsf.eduHealth and Safety Checklist for Early Care and Education Programs: Based on Caring for Our Children National Health and Safety Performance Standards Child Care Center: Meaning Definition 1 Never None of the components of the item are met. 2 Sometimes Less than or 50% (50%) of the components in the item are met. 3 Usually More than 50% (>50%) but less than 100% of the components in the item are met. 4 Always Every component in the item is met (100%).

It is crucial to brain growth and development, especially in a child's first few years. Children need nutrients found in healthy food and drinks to grow. Obesity, heart disease, liver disease, tooth decay, and some kinds of cancer, are linked to diet. It's easier and less costly to prevent these diseases. Children's eating habits form when they are young, so let's get them off to a good start! Licensed child care providers in California must follow the laws and regulations for serving food and drinks in child care programs. First, child care center providers must follow the Federal Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) meal plan requirements. Second, all newly licensed child care providers (Centers and Family Child Care Homes) must complete 16 hours of EMSA approved Preventive Health and Safety Training. This includes one hour on nutrition. And all licensed child care providers (Centers and Family Child Care Homes) must follow the Healthy Beverages in Child Care Act. The four key messages in the Healthy Beverages in Child Care Act are:1. Only unflavored, unsweetened, non-fat (fat free, skim, 0%) or low fat (1%) milk can be served to children 2 years of age or older. 2. No beverages with added sweeteners, natural or artificial, can be served, including sports drinks, sweet teas, juice drinks with added sugars, flavored milk, soda, and diet drinks. 3. A maximum of one serving of 100% juice is allowed per day. 4. Clean and safe drinking water must be readily available at all times; indoors and outdoors and with meals and snacks.Understanding Why Child Nutrition Is Important Nutrition Laws and Regulations for Child Care Nutrition 3.3Breastfeeding Breast milk provides the most easily digested food for infants. It has the right amount of fat, sugar, water, and protein that is needed for an infant's growth and development. Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for infants for at least the first twelve months, and, thereafter, for as long as both mother and child desire. Breast milk contains antibodies that protect infants against common illnesses and allergies. Also, infants who are fed breast milk experience less spit up, constipation, and illness. There are also many benefits for breastfeeding moms. For example, breastfeeding helps mothers to bond with their infants, saves money, and lowers their risk of developing diabetes, breast cancer, and heart disease. Supporting a mother when she wants to breastfeed demonstrates your commitment to the best nutrition for infants. Provide a quiet, comfortable, and private place for mothers to breastfeed and encourage mothers to provide a back-up supply of frozen or refrigerated expressed human milk. Label bottles with the infant's full name and date. Provide information to families about other places in the community that further support mothers who are breastfeeding. Examples of resources include local lactation consultants and breastfeeding support groups (such as La Leche League). Infant Feeding Key Messages: Breast milk contains all of the nutrients infants need and is easiest to digest. Breast milk protects infants from common illnesses, allergies, and obesity. Breast milk promotes good health for mothers and babies. Let parents know you support breastfeeding. Provide a quiet, comfortable, private place for mothers to breastfeed. Learn how to safely handle, store, and feed infant breast milk. Additional support for breastfeeding families and child care providers is available. 3.4 California Childcare Health ProgramFormula Feeding Iron-fortified infant formula is recommended for infants who are not fed breast milk. It contains the balanced nutrition that growing infants need. Infants under six months of age do not need any other beverages besides breast milk or iron-fortified formula. (A medical statement would be needed to serve infants under six months of age anything other than breastmilk or iron fortified formula.) Do not use a microwave to heat infant formula or breast milk. Microwaves do not heat liquids evenly and could burn the infant. In addition, bottles can explode if left in the microwave too long. Instead, warm bottles under warm running water or in a warm water bath. Follow the instructions given by the manufacturer when mixing the formula with water, and make sure the water is from a clean and safe source. If mixing with tap water, use cold water. Goat milk, soy milk, evaporated or whole cow's milk, rice milk and other milk products are not recommended for infants under 12 months of age because they cannot digest them and they do not provide the balanced nutrition growing infants need. Key Messages: Iron-fortified formula is the best substitute for breast milk. Infants under six months of age don't need any other foods or liquids besides breast milk or iron fortified formula. Don't use a microwave oven to heat bottles. Follow the manufacturer's instructions when mixing formula. FEED INFANTS ON DEMAND (WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY) Discuss the infant's typical feeding patterns with families. Look for infants' feeding cues letting you know they are hungry. Feed infants when they are hungry. Responsive feeding (where the providers recognize and respond to infant feeding cues) helps foster trust and reduces overfeeding. Responding to the infant's early signs of hunger can reduce crying. Continue to feed a baby until they indicate fullness. Never force an infant to finish what is in the bottle. Babies are the best judge of how much they need. Babies may want to eat less if they are not feeling well and more if they are growing. Signs of Hunger Signs of Fullness Fussing and tossing Looking like they are going to cry Rooting (sucking motion with the mouth)Sealing their lips together A decrease in sucking Spitting out the nipple Turning away from the nipple Pushing the bottle away Infants and Other Beverages Sugary, sweetened drinks should not be given to infants. They take the place of the more nutritious breast milk or formula that infants need for growth and good health. Offering fruit juice may replace nutrients they need to grow. Do not put juice or sweetened beverages in a bottle. Key Messages: Infants from birth to 6 months old drink only breastmilk or formula. Offer infants 6 to 12 months only water from a cup. Don't give juice or sweetened drinks to infants. Introducing Solid Food Before introducing solid food, communicate with the infant's family to make sure the infant is ready for solid food. Ask the family what foods have been tried at home. At about 6 months, begin to introduce ground or pureed food, one food at a time. Work with the family to decide what foods to provide. It's best to have the family try feeding their baby a new food at home first. Wait for at least 3 to 5 days before introducing another new food. Start with iron-fortified infant cereal or pureed meats. Next, try pureed vegetables and fruits, and then offer other protein rich foods. Infants who are ready to start solid foods: can hold their heads steady, can sit with minimal support, swallow when presented with a spoon, show interest in food and watch intently as others eat. Nutrition 3.5Offer children a variety of healthy foods at meals and snacks. Plan your menu around what's in season\u2014seasonal foods are often the most delicious and usually cost less. Colorful foods with varying textures are attractive and appealing to children. Grains Foods such as rice, oats, cornmeal, wheat, barley or another cereal grain are known as grains. Grains are an important food group and provide many important nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Whole grain products contain all the parts of the grain, meaning none of the fiber or nutritious parts have been removed. Whole grains help children have healthy elimination; help them feel fuller longer; and support growth at a healthy weight. Whole grains contain B vitamins (essential for growth, metabolism, and a healthy nervous system) and magnesium (used to build bones and release energy from muscles). Key Messages: Grains provide many important nutrients, vitamins, and minerals for growing children. Eating whole grains reduces the risk of heart disease, helps children grow at a healthy weight, and prevents constipation. Pasta, cereal, bread, tortillas, and other baked goods are made using grains. Rice, oats, corn, wheat, barley, quinoa, millet, and kamut are examples of grains. SERVE WHOLE GRAINS Oatmeal Brown bread, labeled whole grain or multi-grain Brown rice Whole wheat pasta Quinoa Barley AVOID OR LIMIT NON-WHOLE GRAINS White or enriched bread White rice Flour tortillas Pasta or noodles made from white flourServing Age-Appropriate Healthy Food and Drinks to Children (based on standards from Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2016) Vegetables Vegetables are a plant or part of a plant used as food. Vegetables provide many nutrients such as fiber, folic acid, and other vitamins and minerals that nurture growing children. For example, folic acid helps the body make red blood cells, fiber helps with bowel function and helps children feel full when eating, and vitamins such as Vitamin A from carrots can help strengthen the immune system. Vegetables are also low in calories and help children grow at a healthy weight. Introducing a variety of vegetables helps to develop healthy eating patterns that benefit children their entire lives. Each vegetable has different levels of nutrients, so including a variety of vegetables will help make sure children getting the nutrition they need while they are rapidly growing. Many processed food products contain unhealthy amounts of salt, fat, or sugar. Offering children plain vegetables is the healthiest. If serving commercially prepared vegetables, read the label carefully making sure that the vegetable is the first ingredient listed on the label. Key Messages: Vegetables provide minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients to support children's rapid growth and development. Diets rich in vegetables have been shown to reduce the risks of heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. Vegetables can be served fresh, frozen, or canned (with no added salt, fat, or sugar). For commercially prepared vegetables, the first ingredient on the ingredients list should be the vegetable. 3.6 California Childcare Health ProgramFruit A fruit is the part of a plant that has seeds in it. Fruits are an important source of food for growing children. Fruits provide many nutrients such as folic acid, fiber, and vitamins. For example, Vitamin C from oranges helps in the growth and repair of all body tissues, keeps teeth and gums healthy, and can strengthen the immune system. Diets rich in fruits, such as bananas with potassium, have been shown to reduce the risks of high blood pressure and other illnesses. Include a variety of fruits in your menu. If feeding commercially prepared fruits such as applesauce, peaches, or pears, read the label carefully to check for added sweeteners. Key Messages: Fruit provides minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients that support children's growth and development. Different colors and textures help develop sensory skills. Include a variety of colors: try a rainbow of fruits! Offer unsweetened whole, mashed, or pureed fruits, as developmentally appropriate. Do not add sugar or sweeteners. Fruit can be fresh, frozen, or canned (with no added sugars). For commercially prepared fruits, the fruit should be the first ingredient. SAFETY TIP: To reduce the risk of choking, do not feed young children whole pieces or hard pieces of fruit or vegetables such as apples, carrots, melon, uncooked dried fruit (including raisins), whole grapes, berries, cherries, and cherry tomatoes. Instead, cut these foods into smaller pieces, quarters, with pits and seeds removed. Serve fruits and vegetables ground, mashed, pureed, chopped, cut into small pieces, or shredded. Remove pits and seeds for children under age 4 years. Do not serve whole grapes or whole cherry tomatoes to young childrenProtein Protein in foods such as meat, milk, eggs, and beans is needed for healthy growth. Protein helps build bones, muscles, cartilage, skin and blood. Protein also helps your body make hormones and vitamins. Meat, poultry, fish without bones, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, nut butters, tofu, beans, legumes, and cooked eggs are all examples of protein-rich foods. Avoid serving hot dogs, sausages, or chicken nuggets, because they are high in salt and fat and may contain food additives. SAFETY TIPS Ask parents to try common allergen foods at home first: nuts and nut butter, fish and shell fish, and soy products like tofu. Do not serve fish with bones, chunks of meat, whole nuts or seeds, or spoons-full of nut butter to young children since these foods can cause choking. Do not serve hot dogs or meat products shaped like hot dogs, whole or cut into round slices because they are a leading cause of choking in children. Iron Dietary iron is important for young children so they don't become anemic.* Sources of iron include meat, poultry, seafood, legumes (beans and peas) and dark-green vegetables, as well as foods enriched or fortified with iron, such as many breads and ready- to-eat cereals. Absorption of iron is enhanced by eating vitamin C-rich foods. Foods with Vitamin C include fruits and vegetables such as kiwi, oranges, red pepper, broccoli, grapefruit, Brussel sprouts, potatoes, and tomatoes. Be sure to offer children a variety of nutrient-dense foods to meet their nutritional needs. *Anemia and lead poisoning may occur together. Nutrition 3.7California Childcare Health Program cchp.ucsf.edu Rev. 06/2018Healthy Beverages in Child Care Research shows that unhealthy beverages are a big part of the childhood obesity problem. In 2010, California passed legislation to establish nutrition standards for beverages served in licensed child care centers and family child care homes. These standards went into eect on January 1, 2012. Only unflavored, unsweetened, nonfat (fat free, skim, 0%) or lowfat (1%) milk can be served to children 2 years of age or older. No beverages with added sweeteners, natural or articial, can be served, including sodas, sweet teas, juice drinks with added sugars, flavored milk and diet drinks. A maximum of one serving (4 to 6 ounces for 1-6 year olds*) of 100% juice is allowed per day. Clean and safe drinking water must be available at all times, including meals and snacks. *serving size as per Preventing Childhood Obesity in Early Care and Education Programs, American Academy of Pediatrics 3.8 California Childcare Health ProgramPreventing Foodborne Illness Check your refrigerator thermometer to make sure the temperature is 41 \u00b0F or lower. Fully cook eggs, meat, and fish. Wash your hands before preparing, serving, and eating food and after handling raw fish, eggs, and meat. Pay careful attention to sanitizing surfaces and utensils after handling raw meat and fish. Food Safety Allergy and Choking Prevention Avoid choking hazards by cutting whole fruit and vegetables into pieces smaller than 1/4 inch for infants and 1/2 inch for toddlers. Have children sit when they eat or drink. Watch for allergic reactions such as vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or swelling of the lips or eyes, nasal congestion, coughing, wheezing, asthma-like symptoms, or trouble breathing. For more information on allergies and food safety visit the EMSA Child Care Nutrition Training webpage: h t t p s :// www.emsa.ca.gov/ childcare-nutrition Nutrition 3.9The Nutrition Facts panel can help you choose foods lower in total fat, saturated fat, and trans fat, salt, and sugar. Avoid serving children food with trans fat (partially-hydrogenated and hydrogenated oils). Also, to know how much salt is in a product, look for \"Sodium\" on the label. Choose foods that have less Sodium to reduce the amount of salt you are serving children. The updated nutrition facts label is designed to make it easier for consumers to make healthy choices and includes clearer information about added sugars and serving size. Ingredients List The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires food producers to list all ingredients in their foods. Added sugar and fat comes in many forms - and can be hard to find on the ingredients label. There are many different names for sugar listed on food labels. Some of the more common names are sucrose, cane sugar, sugar, corn syrup, fruit juice concentrate, barley malt, dextrose, maltose, and rice syrup. Nutrition Facts Labels and Ingredients Lists 3.10 California Childcare Health ProgramSugar Sweetened Beverages Juices that are not 100% fruit have names like juice drink, juice cocktail, fruit punch, and lemonade. It will say on the label that these drinks have added sweeteners such as sugar, corn syrup, sugar cane. Don't serve drinks with added sugar or these sugar equivalents on Ingredients Lists: High fructose corn syrup, fructose, corn syrup, honey, cane sugar, evaporated cane juice, sucrose, and sucralose. Contents on the Ingredients List are listed from most to least. This Ingredients List has just one ingredient: White Corn. That tells you there are no added sugars, salt, or fats. Nutrition 3.11Some children have cultural, religious, medical, or developmental concerns which may impact their dietary needs. Work closely with families to develop a feeding plan to promote healthy growth. For families from different cultures, it is important to learn about their needs and special dietary considerations. For medical and behavioral concerns, get instructions from the child's family and health care provider. Develop a written feeding plan. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), licensed child-care centers are expected to provide care and make reasonable accommodations for a child who has special dietary needs. Key Messages: Consult with the child's family on any special dietary needs. Follow the written instructions from the child's primary health care provider. Develop a special health care needs plan in partnership with the family and primary health care provider.Children with Special Dietary Needs Research shows that dietary habits are fairly established at a young age. Create a positive eating experience. Don't force or pressure children to eat all the food that is offered. Creating a positive experience and having a positive attitude towards food will encourage healthy eating patterns. It's okay to encourage children to taste a new food, but don't force or reward them to eat it. And don't insist that children eat everything on their plates. It is normal for children to prefer some foods and reject others. You may need to offer a new food as many as 10 to 20 times before a child is willing to try it. One method that teaches heathy eating behaviors and habits was developed by Ellyn Satter. It is called the Division of Responsibility in Feeding Method. This feeding method builds on children's natural abilities regulate how much to eat. The Division of Responsibility describes how the child care provider or parent is responsible for what, where, when to eat. And the child is responsible for how much, or whether or not to eat. The parent/caregiver is responsible for:The child is responsible for: What food is offered Where it is served and eaten When it is offeredHow much to eat Whether or not to eatFamily Style Meals For family style meals, teachers and children sit at a table together and eat the same food. Foods are passed on serving platters or bowls so children can help themselves. Drinks are served in child- sized pitchers and passed, or placed on the table, so children can pour their own. Adults encourage, but don't force, children to help themselves to all food offered at the meal. One goal of Family Style eating is to make eating an enjoyable experience. Children who cannot self-serve (such as very young children and children with special needs) may need accommodations in order to join the group. Key Messages: Child care providers are role models for healthy eating. Eating at the same table provides an opportunity to have a pleasant conversation at mealtime. Family style meals give teachers an opportunity to talk to children about healthy food. Healthy Feeding, Eating Behaviors, and Habits 3.12 California Childcare Health ProgramCalifornia is home to many cultures and is home to a variety of food traditions. Celebrate the rich culinary customs of the children and families in your program. Respect individual preferences and be sensitive to cultural and family traditions.Individual and Cultural Preferences Keep it fun! There are lots of good ways to include messages about healthy eating in your lessons with children. Take the opportunity to help children understand that healthy food helps them grow strong and healthy!Child Engagement Written policies help child care providers and families understand what will be served and how it will be served in a child care program. Writing policies is the first step for child care providers to provide healthier meals and snacks to the children in their care. Share your written policies with staff and families. This sends a message that nutrition is a priority in your child care program. Clear policies prevent misunderstanding about what food and drinks will be served or can be brought into your child care program for meals, snacks, and celebrations. Make sure that new staff members receive training on your nutrition policies and that parents receive information about your nutrition Policies for Feeding Children in Child Care Settings policies upon enrollment. Consistent practices for feeding children at child care and at home help children to grow strong and healthy with good habits for eating and drinking. Make sure you have policies for how you will keep children with food allergies and special dietary needs safe in your child care setting. Work closely with parents and the child's health care provider when children have special dietary needs. Develop a written special nutrition plan with clear instructions about which foods cause a child to have an allergic reaction and what actions to take in case a child has an allergic reaction.
