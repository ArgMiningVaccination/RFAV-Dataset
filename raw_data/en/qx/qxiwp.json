Mint and basil pots have been actively replaced by Giloy in most households, a plant that's become the quintessential sanjeevani booti of the modern world. People are growing it, juicing it, powdering it -- whatever the form -- they are consuming a lot of it. While its benefits are well known, the hysteria surrounding it right now seems a bit stretched. \"Consuming Giloy juice can help you get rid of fever, which is one of the signs of Covid-19. Its anti-inflammatory properties can also help in tackling [respiratory problems](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/respiratory-problems) like cough, cold, and breathing problems,\" says Parag Kaushik, co-founder, Upakarma [Ayurveda](https://www.speakingtree.in/topics/health/ayurveda) . But it is not an antidote for Covid-19, just like no amount of vitamins or kadhas are. [Antiviral herbs](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/antiviral-herbs) , respiratory restoratives and expectorants are an integral part of curing fevers and bronchial issues in herbalism. But they can only be considered supportive care in Covid-19 and not the cure.No [single drug remedies](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/single-drug-remedies) Immunity is the big word right now and there are no shortcuts for building that. But there isn't such a thing as 'one herb cures all'. \"It is usually a combination of a healthy lifestyle and the correct and therapeutic use of a combination of herbs that can protect us effectively in the present times. That said, overuse of anything, even if it is a known nectar, is equally harmful for us,\" says Dr Manoj Kutteri, Wellness Director at Atmantan Wellness Centre. Also, Ayurveda is a slow process and builds our inner mechanism gradually. \"Consumption of Ayurvedic herbs is subject to one's own body mechanism and pre-existing conditions. The effects of Ayurvedic herbs are not instant. Ayurveda works slowly and it depends upon each person on how much time will it take to show the desired results,\" explains Kaushik.Lets not self-medicate WHO states clearly that while some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for the virus. The same applies to herbal supplements. Some Ayurvedic herbs are made into teas or tonics. Others are formulated in capsules, tablets, and oral tinctures. If purchasing an Ayurvedic herb online, through an Ayurvedic practitioner, or at a specialty [health food store](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/health-food-store) , the general rule of thumb is to never exceed the prescribed dose. There is no guarantee you won't still get side effects, but the general assumption is that the herb is safe at the prescribed dose, at least for short-term use. In the case of Giloy for instance, in some people overuse can cause [constipation](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/constipation) and lower [blood sugar](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/blood-sugar) levels. So if you are diabetic and have been consuming Giloy on a long-term basis, monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. "}
