For children and babies who are no longer nursing, a commercial rehydration formula (like Pedialyte) is generally recommended. For nursing babies and children, [breastmilk is best](https://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/illness-surgery/baby-illness/). Here is a recipe to make an oral rehydration fluid [source: [rehydrate.org](http://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm#recipe)]: - Six (6) level teaspoons of sugar - Half (1/2) level teaspoon of salt - 1 liter of water Homeopathic remedies Although there is little - if any - professional literature in this field on the use of homeopathic medicine, my reading and research has led me to the conclusion that these remedies pose minimal - if any - risk to the nursing baby. Homeopathic remedies are reportedly very safe for nursing moms and babies because the remedies (by definition of homeopathy) contain only very dilute versions of the active substances. Most experts believe that homeopathic remedies are unlikely to pose a problem for the nursing baby and mother. Itchy nipples: Vinegar rinse Mix 1 tablespoon white vinegar with about a cup of water. Lean over the cup and soak nipple in it for a minute or so, then stand over the sink and pour it slowly over the nipple. This can bring immediate relief. If you have itchy nipples, keep in mind that you might have [thrush](https://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/child/thrush-resources/). Low milk supply associated with menstruation: Calcium/magnesium supplement Some women experience a drop in milk supply from ovulation (mid-cycle) until the first day or two of the next menstrual period. A woman's blood calcium levels gradually decrease during this period of time, and for some women the drop in blood calcium causes a drop in milk supply. For women who have this problem, calcium/magnesium supplements may be helpful. This practice has also been reported to eliminate most uterine cramping and some premenstrual discomfort such as water retention. The recommended [calcium supplement](https://kellymom.com/nutrition/vitamins/calcium/#supplements) dosage is between 500 mg calcium/250 mg magnesium and 1500 mg calcium/750 mg magnesium (the higher dosage is generally more effective). Calcium dosages this high should not be taken alone, but as a calcium/magnesium (or calcium/magnesium/zinc) combination. Otherwise the calcium will not be adequately absorbed into your body. The amount of supplement depends on the composition of your diet \u2014 the more animal protein, the more calcium/magnesium needed. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, the lower dosage may work fine for you. If you supplement more than 500 mg calcium per day, then divide the dose so you're not taking it all at once - calcium absorption is best when a person consumes no more than 500 mg at one time. Start the supplement when you ovulate, and continue through the first few days of your menstrual period. If periods are irregular, then begin calcium/magnesium at 14 days after the beginning of your last menstrual cycle, or simply take the supplement every day. Mastitis: a non-antibiotic treatment - Take mom's and baby's clothes off, get into bed and nurse, nurse, nurse (mastitis appears to be the body's way of telling mom to SLOW DOWN). Get as much rest as possible. - Between feedings, use a cold compress on the breast to help with any inflammation. Some moms use hot compresses directly before nursing, but others prefer to stick to the cold. Compresses/poultices that can be helpful: - Make a rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) infusion: to make an infusion, add 2-4 teaspoons of fresh or dried rosemary to a cup of boiling water. Infuse (steep) for 10 minutes, then strain. - Use a [fenugreek seed poultice](https://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/engorgement/#fenugreek); - Make a dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) compress: boil about an ounce of minced dandelion root in two to three cups of water until only half the liquid remains; use compresses of the resulting brew. - When your baby nurses on the affected side (use that side first), massage the breast towards the nipple. Massage the breast often during feedings and between feedings to help loosen the plugged area. - If there is a fever, mom can take - Probiotic supplements- [Several studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22Mastitis%22%5BMesh%5D%20AND%20%22Probiotics%22%5BMajr%5D%20AND%20%22humans%22%5BMeSH%20Terms%5D&cmd=DetailsSearch)have shown that probiotic supplements (certain Lactobacillus strains) are effective in treating infectious mastitis and also resulted in a lower occurrence of repeat mastitis compared to antibiotic treatment. - Raw garlic- At least 2-3 raw cloves per day, 4-5 cloves a day if possible. Chop a clove into 5 or 6 pieces and then swallow the pieces whole like pills.Raw garlic acts as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, without the added antibiotic side effects of the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, or the development of yeast infections or thrush. The antimicrobial property in garlic, allicin, is very sensitive to heat and is destroyed when cooked. In order for it to work, it needs to be raw. Swallowing the cloves with orange juice helps with the taste for some. Allicin is also what gives garlic its pungent odor, so the deodorized garlic capsules that some companies offer are essentially useless, if they are being taken for the antimicrobial properties. However, deodorized garlic is still beneficial for its blood pressure reducing properties and for stimulating the immune system. - Tincture of echinacea, 3-4 times/day - Tincture of Oregon grape root, a day - Vitamin C (3000-5000 megadose) - Another option: Mix a dropperful of echinacea tincture, three cloves of raw garlic and four to six ounces of carrot juice in a blender and drink the mixture every two hours. - Probiotic supplements- - A very warm shower can help - let the water just run over your breast. - You can also take ibuprofen, which will help with inflammation and pain. - If the mastitis does not improve or gets worse after using this treatment for 24-48 hours, contact your doctor - you may need antibiotic treatment.

This enables the blood to get nutrients to all parts of the brain. Warning - this can burn a bit, so keep the grains of cayenne down to as few as possible. To stop a migraine follow these simple steps: - Open the capsule and dip the flat end of a dry toothpick into the cayenne to pick up 3-4 grains. - Block one nostril and gently put cayenne up the other nostril. - Sniff deeply 3-4 times until you feel the flecks of pepper in your throat. (If you don't feel this, do it again). - Once you feel the warmth in your throat, you headache should be gone in minutes Other suggestions: Taking 500 mg of magnesium per day and increasing your water intake to 8-10 glasses per day can be helpful. One person reported that her migraines were still coming at the time they usually did (during her cycle), but were much less intense and went away faster. Another person resolved her migraine problem by eliminating ALL animal fat the week before menstruation (skim milk, non-fat yogurt ok), and adding evening primrose oil to her diet. If you feel that you need migraine meds, keep in mind that a number of migraine meds are considered compatible with breastfeeding, including [Sumatriptan (Imitrex)](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-7741/sumatriptan-oral/details/list-precautions). Here are a couple [Natural Migraine Treatment FAQ](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/medicine/migraine/natural-cures/). \"This Natural Migraine Treatment FAQ, posted to alt.support.headaches.migraine, attempts to summarize all non-medical treatments that help prevent or cure migraine headaches.

See [Lecithin treatment for recurrent plugged ducts](https://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/lecithin/) for more information. More information on treating recurrent plugged ducts can be found here: [Recurrent Mastitis or Plugged Ducts](https://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/recurrent-mastitis/) Plugged milk duct: Potato Place grated raw cold potato on the affected breast. Cover with towels until dry. Repeat if desired. More information on treating plugged ducts can be found here: [Mastitis or Plugged Ducts](https://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/mastitis/) Sore nipples: Tea bags There are better ways to heal sore nipples. Warm water dips (or etc.) and more commonly used to treat sore nipples. Any time that mom has sore nipples, the cause of the soreness should also be addressed. Studies are conflicting on whether tea bags are helpful for reducing the pain of sore nipples (Riordan 2005). The tannic acid in the tea (which has astrigent qualities) can cause drying and cracking (Lawrence 2005), and anecdotal evidence suggests that some babies do not suck as well after tea bags have been used. In some locations, wet tea bags remain a popular folk remedy for the treatment of nipple pain. They are inexpensive and can be found in most homes, making them easily accessible at the onset of difficulties. They may be soothing because of the moist warmth. Tea bags have been the subject of a number of studies; they appear neither to prevent nor reduce nipple soreness (Lavergne 1997). Furthermore, the tannic acid in the tea can act as an astringent causing drying and cracking, rather than healing. \u2014 from \" [Nipple Pain: Causes, Treatments, and Remedies]\" by RA, Lawrence RM, editors.

Evening primrose oil is generally considered safe for nursing moms. It is reported useful for nursing moms who are trying to conceive. It is also reported useful for treating postpartum depression, sore nipples during ovulation, PMS, fibrocystic breasts, [Raynaud's and [plugged ducts](https://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/lecithin/). EPO is derived from Oenothera biennis seeds and is an excellent source of essential fatty acids and their more complex metabolites GLA ( gamma linoleic acid). The suggested dosages that I have seen vary from 500-6500 mg per day for various problems: 500 mg per day has been suggested for breastfeeding moms with sore nipples during ovulation; 1000 mg 3 times a day for PMS or fibrocystic breasts. According to Hale, overt toxicity of this product appears to be quite low. No pediatric concerns have been reported. The Botanical Safety Handbook regards EPO as \"safe when used appropriately.\" Overdoses of essential fatty acids have been known to provoke gall bladder attacks.
