Public Health was created by public health leaders in the Atlantic Provinces who worked together as members of the Public Health Orie ntation Working Group. The work was jointly funded by the Public Hea lth Agency of Canada and Nova Scotia's Department of Health Promotion and Protection. This project was organized to cr eate an initial orientation module that offers an introduction to public health. Although beyond the scope of this project, the Working Group recognized that future work is required to create a complete public health orientation proce ss. It is hoped this module can be incorporated into a full public health orientation pro cess once it is developed. Please find below the module plan for Public Health 101. Public Health 101 Orientation Module Plan Description of the Module This module is called PH101: An Introduction to Public Health . The module is available to participants as a Microsoft Word document or as a pdf file. The module contents are available in both French and E nglish, based primarily on Canadi an literature, and are written with the assumption that the reader has an e ducational background in a health related field. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 2 Purpose The module was developed for use with the following target audiences: New public health practitioners who are comple ting orientation, to provide them with an introduction to public health (p rimary target audience); and Existing public health practitioners to genera te discussion about issues and promote the use of common language in the public hea lth field (secondary target audience). Expected Outcomes By completing the module, participants should gain new knowledge or reflect on their current understanding of public health by exploring content relate d to questions such as: What is public health? What is the history of pu blic health in Canada? How does public health differ fr om other sectors in health? What are public health approach es, functions and principles? What are the core competencies for p ublic health practice in Canada? Methods Participants are provided an electronic and/or hard copy of the module; Participants are expected to take a self-directed approach to learning and may choose to read the module on their own or with other colleagues; It is suggested that participants record questi ons and/or issues they discover related to the module content while they are reading the document. Notes pages are provided at the back of the module for this purpose; Participants are encouraged to discuss with colleagues the issues and questions they have recorded about the module; and Participants are asked to complete an eval uation of the module and discuss the evaluation with a supervisor. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 3 Resources Time is required to read through the module. The estimated time for completion of the module will vary for participants, and may ra nge from 4 hours to 8 hours. Some users may prefer to spend concentrated time comp leting the module in full, while others may choose to complete specific sections of the module over a more extended time period. Access to the Internet is beneficial, as th is allows the user to access and read many additional resources online that are suggested throughout the module. Evaluation Phase One - Pilot Testing: In Februar y, March and April of 2007, 46 public health practitioners were provided w ith a draft of the orientati on module and asked to provide written feedback regarding its contents. Th e draft module was available in both French and English. The pilot test included participation from new public health practitioners who had been hired to work in public hea lth for the first time, and public health practitioners with 1+ years experience wo rking within their cu rrent public health positions. Written feedback was received from pa rticipants in each of the four Atlantic provinces. This feedback was reviewed by the Public Health Orientation Working Group and revisions were made to the orientation module, incorporating mu ch of the feedback received from the pilot test participants. Phase Two - Ongoing Evaluation: At the e nd of the module an evaluation is provided, and participants are encouraged to complete the evaluation and di scuss it with their supervisor. The results of these evaluations will also be used to revise and improve the module as required. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 4 What is Public Health? People who work in the diverse field of public health actively cont ribute to building and sustaining healthy communities. In your commun ity today, public health practitioners may be found: Working to increase public awareness rega rding the importance of wearing bicycle helmets, or using car seats for children; Exploring the health effect s experienced by people who have been exposed to a known environmental hazard; Monitoring information to identify outbreak s and trends with certain illnesses and diseases, and intervening to prevent the spread of illness and disease; Creating policies in schools a nd child care centres to better ensure healthy eating practices are established early in life; Advocating for sustainable housing so families can live more safely and comfortably; Ensuring that water and food supplie s are safe for consumption; and Providing services amidst natura l and human made disasters. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 5 Public health has been described as: \"...the science and art of promoting health, preventing disease, prolonging life and improving quality of life through the organize d efforts of society. As such, public health combines sciences, skills, and be liefs directed to the maintenance and improvement of health of all people th rough collective action. The programs, services, and institutions involved tend to emphasize two things: the prevention of disease, and the health needs of the population as a whole\" (p. 46). 1 While the term \"public health\" can be used in slightly different ways, for the purposes of this module, public health is primarily being used to refer to the set of government funded services whose intent is to improve and prot ect the health of the public. There are a core set of programs and services that tend to be common from one juri sdiction to another: Prevention and control of chr onic diseases and injuries Prevention and control of communicable diseases Environmental health Healthy development throughout the lifecy cle including maternal/child health. Table 1 provides a few suggestions regardi ng additional resources to access for general public health information. Table 1: General Public Health In formation: Additional Resources Glossary of Terms Relevant to Public Health Competencies2 The Public Health Agency of Canada has provided a glossary of terms relevant to public health competencies, compiled by Dr. John M. Last, and available at http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/php- psp/core_competencies_glossary_e.html Canadian Coalition for Public Health in the 21st Century3-7 This is a webpage within the Canadian Public Health Association's website, that contains many links to documents, reports and fact sheets related to public health. This page can be found at: http://www.cpha.ca/coalition/ November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 6 Public Health in Atlantic Canada: A Discussion Paper8 This document was created in 2005 for the Public Health Agency of Canada, to help outline some of the issues, challenges and successes specific to public health in Atlantic Canada. This report can be accessed at: http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/canada/regions/atlantic/P ublications/PH_Discussion/public_health_2005_e.pdf November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 7 The Public Health Workforce The public health system relies on a highly skille d workforce to provide co nsistent and effective services to Canadians. It has been recognized that there is lim ited quantitative data available on the state of public health human resources in Ca nada, and work is being done to improve this.1, 9 The practice of public health re quires collaboration between ma ny different providers. These providers work together to offe r services that address both the needs of populations as well as individuals. 9 There is no single employer of all the pr oviders contributing to public health in a community; providers need to know who to connect with in various orga nizations to provide effective services to the populat ion. Table 2 provides an overv iew of many of the providers working within the public health system.9 Table 2: The Public Health Workforce Anthropologists Audiologists Biostatisticians Communication officers Community development workers Community health representatives in Aboriginal communities Community lay health visitors Dental assistants Dental hygienists Dentists Dietitians Engineers Epidemiologists Geographers Health educators Health promotion specialists Infection control practitioners Infectious disease specialists Laboratory personnel/technicians Lawyers Licensed practical nurses Medical microbiologists Medical officers of health Nurses Nutritionists Occupational therapists Pharmacists Physicians Physiotherapists Public health inspectors Sociologists Speech-language pathologists Veterinarians November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 8 There are three types of involvement with public health that these disciplines might have: Some of the activities routinely performed by a practitioner are co ntributing to overall public health goals. For example, a practitione r seeing a patient/client in their office and providing tobacco cessation counseling is contri buting to the overall public health goal of reducing tobacco use. A practitioner may be involved in delivering a specific service in a public health setting. For example a lawyer from the local munici pality or provincial government may provide legal advice regarding applica tion of public health regulatio ns (e.g. exposure to tobacco smoke in public places, isolation of an infect ed individual who poses a risk to others). A family physician my work part-time in th e organization's healthy sexuality clinic. Many practitioners have careers in public health working fo r public health organizations at local/regional, provinci al and national levels. There are many human resources issues facing each of the provider groups listed above. To illustrate some of the issues in the public health system today, examples from a few provider groups are listed below: It is estimated that public health nurses ma ke up approximately 30% of the public health workforce. 1 Public health is experiencing a shortage of nurses similar to the other sectors within the health system, and recruitment is especially difficult in rural and remote communities.1 In many parts of Canada, public hea lth practitioners have been devolved from provincial roles and integrated into existing local or district health authorities. It has been reported that this integration has someti mes led to a loss of identity for public health nursing and its focus on th e health of populations.1 There are approximately 200 physicians wo rking as Medical Officers of Health throughout the country, and just over 20 of these are employed in Atlantic Canada.1 It has been estimated that approximately 30% of the Medical Officers of Health are eligible for retirement within the next decade, and c oncern exists there is a limited supply of physicians trained in public health to fill the vacanc ies being created.1 November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 9 Canadian epidemiologists' pres ent contributions related to chronic diseases and health services research are invaluable to the wo rk of public health. Recommendations to strengthen the public health workforce in Canada include the need to increase the number of epidemiologists completing infectious dis ease research and outbreak investigation, to ensure all aspects of public he alth are benefiting from the e xpertise epidemiologists have to offer. 1 Please refer to Table 3 for a link to more info rmation regarding public health human resources planning. Table 3: Public Health Human Resources Building the Public Health Workforce for the 21st Century9 This document proposes the implementation of a collaborative public health human resources planning framework to be implemented across Canada. It is available at: http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/php- psp/pdf/building_the_public_health_workforce_fo_%20the-21stc_e.pdf November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 10 What is the History of Public Health in Canada? For centuries, public health throughout the world has been recognized as having concern for the health of humans. It has also been recognized that the treatment of illn ess in individuals is different than public health's focus on preven ting disease and protec ting the health of a population.10 Throughout the late 1800s and first few years of the 1900s, the formal public health system was not well developed in Canada. Despite the establ ishment of boards of health, many public health providers had little to no formal training. 1, 11 They were primarily focused on dealing with outbreaks of communicable diseases, quarantines , immunizations, and epidemics of small pox and cholera.1 Public health has always relied on health informa tion to investigate reason s for poor health and to help make decisions. In the early twentieth cen tury, much of public health's focus was on the prevention of communicable diseases, sani tation, and maternal and child health. 12 Many areas in the country had unsafe water supplies and unsanitary sewage and waste disposal.11 Outbreaks of typhoid fever, smallpox, diphtheria, German me asles and whooping cough continued to occur, which resulted in many pre-mature deaths and much chronic illness.11 As the twentieth century evolve d, vaccinations became more r eadily available, although the public was often resistant to receiving them. 11 However, the local boar ds of health worked to complete health inspections and implement re gulation to protect the health of the public.1 Immunizations, pasteurization, th e containment of tuberculos is, the control of sexually transmitted diseases, and child and maternal health all experienced substantial advancements that saved lives and helped to increase life expectancy for Canadians.1, 11 Following World War II and into the 1950s, clinical medicine im proved substantially in its ability to treat disease. Surgical technique s advanced and the public became focused on the possibilities that clinical medici ne had to offer the individual. 1 At this time public health appeared to take a background pos ition to clinical medicine.1 The majority of funding for health November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 11 became directed towards personal health services to treat disease, rather than to public health services that focused more on the prevention of disease and improvement of health within the population. Beginning in the 1970s and continuing into the 1 990s, various efforts were made to emphasize public health's role beyond infec tious diseases to also look at areas such as chronic disease prevention and health promotion with both individuals and populations. 13 In 1974, Lalonde's report A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians 14 was released. This document suggested that enhancements made to personal lifestyles a nd social and physical environments could lead to more substantial he alth improvements for Canadians than could be gained by solely increasing the availabili ty of existing health care services.15 Following the release of this document, ma ny successful health promotion programs were implemented in Canada and internationally that focused on d ecreasing the risks associated with personal behaviours and lifestyles related to issues such as fitness, nutrition and smoking.15 In 1986, the first International C onference on Health Promotion was held in Ottawa, Canada, and the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion16 was created. This document defined health promotion, emphasized the importance of health de terminants and suggested strategies to use when completing health promotion work. More details from this document can be found on page 32 of this module. Also released at this conference in 1986 was the Epp report, Achieving Health for All: A Framework for Health Promotion .17 Epp noted that to achieve health for all Canadians, it was necessary to provide a combination of health promotion, disease prevention and health care services. To better inform decision making related to healt h, the Canadian Institute of Health Information 18 (often referred to as CIHI), was established in 1991 as an independent, non-profit organization to collect and analyze data on the availability and quality of health care in Canada.13 CIHI has been instrumental in developing consistent health indi cators for use across Canada. Health indicators are standardized measures that help local he alth systems understand th e overall health of communities and the health services available to them.18 November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 12 Throughout the 20th century, population health strategies con tinued to be explored in Canada. In the 1994 document Strategies for Population Health: In vesting in the Health of Canadians,19 the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Advisory Comm ittee on Population Health outlined a population health framework and strategic directions. Subsequently, the Report on the Health of Canadians was released in 1996, presenting the results from the first collaborative e ffort between federal, provincial and territorial gove rnments to measure the health of Canada's population.20 In 1997, the two volume report Canada Health Action: Building on the Legacy21 was released as a result of the work of the Na tional Forum on Health. This Fo rum was established from 1994 to 1997 to find innovative ways to improve the hea lth of Canadians and the Canadian health system.21 The recommendations were organized under th e headings of values, striking a balance, determinants of health and evidence-based decision making. Upon entering the 21 st century, despite public health's impor tant role in disease prevention and health protection, public health's importance continued to often not be recognized and services remained inadequately resourced. The Federa l/Provincial/Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health presented a Review of Public Health Capacity in Canada22 to the Deputy Ministers of Health in June of 2001, outlining con cerns for public health's reduced capacity to function optimally throughout the country. Th is report was never formally disseminated.1 Shortly after the presentation of this docu ment, the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001 in the United States and the 2003 SARS outbreak in Canada occurred. These events created further discussion and calls for reform within the Canadian public health system. The events of September 11 th, 2001 underscored the necessity for a ll levels of government within Canada to have integrated emergency preparedness and response plans. An Emergency Management Framework for Canada23 is now available through Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada and calls for partnerships and collaboration be tween all sectors of Canadian society. After Canada's public health experience w ith the SARS outbreak in 2003, many people questioned whether Canada's public health system was adequately resourced to deal with a November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 13 national outbreak of a new comm unicable disease. Many experts demanded a renewal of the public health system in Canada. Often refe rred to as the Naylor report, the document Learning from SARS: Renewal of Public Health in Canada1, was created by the National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Healt h. It highlighted that public health would not be able to succeed without a highly skilled and adequately re sourced public health workforce available at every local health agency throughout Canada.13 In 2006, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care released The SARS Commission: Spri ng of Fear Final Report24 that also contained many key learning and reco mmendations related to public he alth renewal, public health legislation and operational management of an out break. Table 4 provides links to more extensive information regarding the history and renewal of public health in Canada. Table 4: The History of Public Health: Additional Resources Celebrating our Past11 This document outlines a speech given by Dr. John E.F.

It is available at: http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/93/3/388.pdf November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 14 Public Health Renewal in Canada Over the last few decades, many experts in multiple reports have made consistent recommendations for the renewal of th e public health system in Canada.1, 24, 26-28 The Government of Canada has responded to many of these recommendations and work is presently being done to improve and revitalize Canada's public health system. The overall national strategy to strengthen public he alth in Canada has resulted in the following few examples: 1. The Creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada29 Created in 2004, the Public Health Agency provi des national leadership on issues related to chronic disease and future infectious disease epid emics. It encourages collaboration across all jurisdictions in the country. On December 12, 2006 the Public Health Agency of Canada Act30 officially came into force. This Act provides a statutory basis for the Agency and confirms the duties of the Chief Public Health Officer for Canada.31 2. Health Goals for Canada29 In 2004, the Prime Minister and Firs t Ministers made a commitment to establish health goals for Canada to guide the improvement of health for Ca nadians. It was agreed that these goals would be developed based on extensive consultation with both experts and the Canadian public.32 Consultations were held, and the health goals we re agreed upon in 2005. Please see Table 5 for a link to the health goals. 3. The Formation of the National Collaborating Centres 29 In 2004, the Prime Minister and Fi rst Ministers made a commitment to establish six National Collaborating Centres for Public Health, as part of a plan to strengthen the Canadian public health system. A link to more information a bout these Centres is provided in Table 5. Table 5 provides links to additi onal information regarding public he alth renewal in Canada from a national perspective.

This document is available at: http://www.phac- aspc.gc.ca/publicat/sar s-sras/pdf/sars-e.pdf Improving Public Health Syst em Infrastructure in Canada26 In this report, the Strengthening Public Health System Infrastructure Task Group, which was a task group of the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Ad visory Committee on Population Health and Health Security, offers recommendations for public health system renewal. This document is available at: http://www.phac- aspc.gc.ca/php-psp/pdf/improving_public_health_infrastructure_in_canada_e.pdf Health Goals for Canada29 Information about the development of the health goals is available at: http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hgc- osc/home.html , and a copy of the health goals is available at: http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hgc-osc/pdf/goals- e.pdf The Formation of the Nati onal Collaborating Centres29 The National Collaborating Centres work to foster linkages and each act as a national focal point in a specialized area of public health. More information about the Collaborating Centres is available at: http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/medi a/nr-rp/2004/2004_01bk2_e.html Public health however, is predominantly a respon sibility of provinces and territories. In recent years, many of these jurisdictions have also be en taking stock of thei r current public health systems and taking action to improve them. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 16 How is the Public Health System Different, But Complementary to the Personal Health Services System? Most people have had multiple and repeated expe riences interacting with the personal health services system. Whether it is seeing a family physician or spec ialist, going to an emergency department, or just watching TV, there is a le vel of understanding of this system among the public. In contrast, much of what public health does is hidden behind the scenes. A prevented disease or injury is invisible. A prevented outbreak does not occu r. As a system, public health \"tends to operate in the bac kground unless there is an unexpected outbreak of disease such as SARS or failure of health protection as occurred with water contaminatio n in Walkerton, Ontario (2000) or North Battleford, Saskatchewan (2001)\" (p.2).1 While the obesity epidemic is noted, there is little common understa nding of the assessment, anal ysis and comprehensive action occurring behind the scenes. Despite this differe nce in visibility, much of the improvement in health over the past 100 years has been due to public he alth interventions. Much of the information in the section be low was taken directly from the resource: The Renewal of Public Health in Nova Scotia: Building a P ublic Health System to Meet the Needs of Nova Scotians . 33 A key differentiating feature betw een the two systems is their focus. While personal health services are focused on the individual, public he alth is focused on population needs. Public health organizations will deliver programs and se rvices to individuals, but these are often done with the broader intent of improving the populati on's health. For example, individual cases of communicable diseases are investigated and interv entions made, but these are a component of the overall strategy of preventing further illness in others. While immunizations are given to individuals, the public health goal is to accomp lish sufficient coverage at the population level in order to achieve \"herd immunity\" (please see foot note 1). Preventing an outbreak of measles is dependent on the level of pr otection throughout the population. 1 The resistance of a group to invasion and spread of an infectious agent, based on the resistance to infection of a high proportion of individual members of the group. From: Last JM, editor. A dictionary of epidemiology. Oxford University Press: Toronto, 2001. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 17 This difference in focus has implications on how the systems are structured and operate. In clinical care, if a pr imary care physician requires assistance with a problem that exceeds their experience or expertise, s/he will consult a special ist that is typically base d at the local secondary level hospital. If the specialist at that facility is in similar need of a ssistance, s/he will consult with the tertiary level teaching hospital. If a phone consultation cannot deal with the situation, then the patient can be physically sent to the appropriate setting. Public health is similar in that practitioners at th e front lines of the system need to request advice and assistance from the next level of the system. The critical diffe rence is that the next level is within government at the provincial and then fede ral levels. This means that the public health role and types of expertise required at the provinc ial and federal levels are going to be extremely different from those required for other types of services. One does not expect a senior provincial bureaucrat to be able to provide advice on the clinical manageme nt of a severely ill patient; however, one does expect that the public health e xpertise will be available at the provincial level to assist with the unusual/large ou tbreak or provide evidence-based advice regarding how best to pursue a change in tobacco policies in a community. The additional distinction is that while a patient requiring a higher level of care can be transferred out of a health authority to another part of th e province to acquire that care, one cannot move communities with their associated outbreaks, obes ity epidemics, or environmental contaminants. The public health system needs to be designed in such a way that the supports are available and come to the health authority in need of them. The development of inter-disciplinary teams is an increasing aspect of care in the personal health services system. Such teams have always been a fundamental part of the work in public health, although the range of disciplines working in the pub lic health system is different. There is an additional level of complexity in public health because of the im portance of the provincial system level to be actively involved in supporting the staff of the local au thority. In some instances, the provincial level is the more appr opriate system level to deliver certain aspects of selected programs (e.g. large social marketing campaigns, surveillance, etc.). Therefore it is more appropriate to think of a single set of public health programs a nd to acknowledge the relative November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 18 roles and contributions of the diffe rent system levels in their deliv ery. Essentially, the local staff working for the health authority and the provincial level public health staff need to be thought of as team members working together to impr ove and protect the health of the public. Public Health and Primary Health Care The renewed emphasis on \"primary health care\" in recent years has prompt ed discussion about its boundaries with public health. It is an excellent example of how there is a complementary relationship between public health and personal health services. Ta ble 6 offers insight into the complementary roles that exist w ithin the public health and primar y health care systems. While there can be overlap for specific activities that might be performe d by either of the systems (e.g. immunizations), the reality is that many of the needed activities can be clearly categorized to one group or another. What is particularly important is that the activities of neither system exist in isolation and are in fact inter-dependent.

November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 20 An Example of Collaboration between Public Health and Acute Care Mrs. Smith is a 75 year old woman who has osteo porosis, who is very active in her community. Mr. Mancini is a 68 year old man who has rheuma toid arthritis. He lives alone and finds it difficult to leave his house unless he has someon e available to help him get up and down the stairs at the front entrance. Mrs. Smith and Mr . Mancini are neighbours and they live in the same rural community in Atlantic Canada. In Mr. Mancini's and Mrs. Smith's province, an assessment of seniors' health needs indicated that falls are a significant cause of preventa ble morbidity and mortal ity. A review of the scientific literature indicated that the best pr actices for falls preventi on included: improving the strength and balance of seniors; reviewing and reducing their nu mber of medications; addressing physical hazards in their home e nvironment; and checking for vision de ficits. Equipped with this health status and intervention information, public h ealth practitioners developed an inter-sectoral provincial committee to address falls prevention fo r seniors. The goal of the committee is to develop a framework for action, aimed at implem enting community-based programs to reduce the number of falls experienced by seniors. Members on the committee represent the following: A seniors' fitness program; A meals on wheels program; Places of spirituality and worship; A seniors' wellness organization; Public health in the province; The Public Health Agency of Canada; and Health professionals from the disciplines of occupational therapy, physiotherapy, nursing, medicine, and pharmacy. To raise community awareness, the committee ha s created and implemented an annual Falls Prevention Day where information is shared through community organi zations and the media offering suggestions of ways to prevent falls. On Falls Prevention Day this year, Mrs. Smith heard about the falls prevention su ggestions at a lunch and learn se ssion in her church. She took home a checklist of changes that she could make around her house to help eliminate the risks of falls. This included tightening up her stairs' handrails and removi ng two loose throw mats in her November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 21 kitchen. She also decided to in crease her indoor walking program fr om one to three days a week, to help her stay in shape. Wh en a local politician came to visit, she also planned to ask that sidewalks be considered for the main street in the adjacent town wh ere she did her shopping. Mrs. Smith realized Mr. Mancini may not have had a chance to get out to an education session, so she decided to visit him to share some of th e ideas she had heard. When she arrived at his house, Mr. Mancini was not there. Mrs. Smith la ter learned that Mr. Mancini had fallen on his front steps and broken his hip. He was now in hos pital and had received a total hip replacement. She visited him there and was pleased to find that he had been given many exercises and precautions about how to move his legs at home for the next few weeks to protect his new hip and tips on how to prevent falling in the future. A therapist was also scheduled to visit his home at the time of his discharge from hospital. Mrs. Smith was concerned about the many other seniors who needed to learn more about fall prevention and would likely need some help in assessing risks in their homes and making changes. She contacted her loca l health authority and was direct ed to the public health injury prevention staff. Building on the increased awar eness from the Falls Prevention Day, they had already been building a local ne twork of individuals and organi zations interested in falls prevention and she was welcomed as a community member to the network. The network's planning had recognized that there was going to need to be a comb ination of interventions that would occur in health care settings such as physician's offices, emergency departments, and pharmacies, as well as people's homes and the broader community. Initial interventions being considered including identifying community opportunities for increasing strength and balance, identifying and advocating for a reduction of existing physical hazards, assessing for polypharmacy by pharmacists and physicians, and how best to provide assistance with assessments of home envir onments. These set of actions represent a Table 7: Health Promotion Strategies Build healthy public policy Create supportive environments Strengthen community action Develop personal skills Reorient health services to prevention November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 22 comprehensive public health approach to a health issue and illustrate the strategies for health promotion16 (please see Table 7). The community partne rship is critical b ecause not all of the specific activities can be done by any particular service provider group or organization. Table 8 provides examples of contributi ons made by public health, pers onal health services and other partners.

Many different approaches must be used to deliv er the diverse services that the public health system offers its communities. These different a pproaches are often collectively referred to as the population health approach. Mu ch of the information in the section below was taken directly from the resource: Healthy People, Healthy Communities: Using the Population Health Approach in Nova Scotia .34 Population Health Approach Over the past several years, there has been much discussion about \"population health\" and the \"determinants of health.\" Addressing the range of factors that determine health status is called a \"population health approach.\" A population health approach aims to decrease disparities and maintain and improve the health status of the enti re population. The strategies we use to increase the health of the population also bring wider social, economic and e nvironmental benefits to the population as well. A population health approach involves citizens from different backgrounds in identifying and building upon the things that make and keep their communities healthy. There are many factors that influence our health. When it comes to our hea lth, research shows us that having an adequate income, a good education, a nd a safe environment is just as important as how much exercise we get or what food we eat . Our health is strongly linked with our opportunities to work, learn, play and contribute to our community. Health is also linked to where we live, how we care for each other, our sense of belonging in our community and how much love, attention and stimulation we receive as children. Income and social status are more important than any other single f actor that affects our health. Research shows that people with higher income and social status have greater control over their lives, especially stressful situations, and this is di rectly related to their he alth. When you look at the population as a whole, as income increases, so too does health. But this does not mean that the wealthiest countries always ha ve the best life expectancy rates. It is those with the fairest sharing of income and power th roughout the population that have the best life expectancy. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 24 Education and employment are both related to income and helping people gain control over their lives. Education enables people to seek and act upon health info rmation, seek needed health services, and advocate for resources that support the health of their children and family members. The physical environment is a key influence on our health, such as soil, ai r and water quality or safe housing or workplaces. Our health is also influenced by personal health practices such as smoking, the physical characteristics that we inheri ted from our parents, our gender, the culture we grow up in, and health services (especially th ose designed to promote or maintain health). Health is greatly influenced by sharing and carin g in our communities. Social capital research has shown that the more that people are invo lved socially with their family, friends and community, the more likely they ar e to be healthy. Meaningful so cial relationships help people cope with stress, solve problems, and give peopl e a greater sense of c ontrol over their lives. Some researchers believe that soci al relationships are more important in maintaining health even than are good health practices. There are still other factors that influence the he alth of our population. Research has shown that people who are unemployed are more likely to be unhealthy. Our ear ly childhood experiences are also strongly related to our health. Making sure that childr en have opportunities to develop self-esteem, parent/child attachme nt, healthy life practices, coping a nd social skills early in life have been shown to positively affect their health la ter in life. The health of our population is influenced by many di fferent factors. These factors that affect our health are often called \"determina nts of health. To improve the health of our population, we need an approach that addresses all of the factors that influence our h ealth. It is not enough to address any single factor alone, because of the wa y that all of the factors interact. The Determinants of Health Please find below some additional in formation on select determinants of health. Definitions of the determinants of health continue to evolve, such that this is not an exhaustive list. The following information was taken directly from the Public Health Agency of Canada's web page titled Determinants of Health .35 November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 25 Income and Social Status Health status improves at each step up the inco me and social hierarchy. High income promotes living conditions such as safe housing and the ab ility to buy sufficient goo d food. The healthiest populations are those in societie s which are prosperous and have an equitable distribution of wealth. Social Support Networks Support from families, friends a nd communities is associated with better health. Effective responses to stress and the support of family and friends seem to act as a buffer against health problems. Education Health status improves with each level of e ducation. Education increases opportunities for income and job security, and gives people a sense of control over life circ umstances - key factors that influence health. Employment and Working Conditions Unemployment is associated with poorer health. People who have more control over their work circumstances and fewer stressful job demands are healthier and often live longer than those involved in more stressful or riskier work and activities. Social Environments Social stability and strong communities can help reduce health risks. Studies have shown a link between low availability of emotional support, lo w social participation, and mortality (whatever the cause). Geography Whether people live in remote, rural communities or urban centres can have an impact on their health. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 26 Physical Environments Physical factors in the natura l environment (e.g. air and water quality) ar e key influences on health. Factors in the human-built environmen t such as housing, workplace safety, community and road design are also important influences. Healthy Child Development The effect of prenatal and ear ly childhood experiences on subseque nt health, well-being, coping skills and competence is very powerful. Childre n born in low-income families are more likely than those born to high-income families to have low birth weights, to eat less nutritious food, and to have more difficulty in school. Health Services Health services, particularly t hose designed to maintain and prom ote health, to prevent disease, and to restore health and function, co ntribute to the population's health. Gender Women are more vulnerable to sexual or physical violence, low income, single parenthood, and health risks such as accidents, sexually transmitted diseases, suicide, smoking and physical inactivity. Measures to address gender inequality within and beyond the health system improve population health. Culture Belonging to a particular race or ethnic or cultural group influences population health. The health of members of certain cultural groups (e .g. First Nations, visible minorities, and recent immigrants) can be more vulnerable because of th eir cultural differences and the risks to which they are jointly exposed. Two other commonly discussed determinants of h ealth are listed below. This information was taken directly from the Public Health Agency of Canada's web page titled What Determines Health? 36 November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 27 Personal Health Practices and Coping Skills These refer to actions by which individuals can prev ent diseases and promote self-care, cope with challenges, and develop self-reliance, solve prob lems and make choices that enhance health. Biology and Genetic Endowment The basic biology and organic make-up of the human body are a fundamental determinant of health. Genetic endowment provides an inherite d predisposition to a wide range of individual responses that affect health status. Although socio-economic and environmental factors are important determinants of overall health, in so me circumstances genetic endowment appears to predispose certain individuals to partic ular diseases or health problems. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 28 An Example of the Population Health Approach in Action Table 9 provides an example of why improvi ng the health of the population depends on our ability to address more than one of the determinants of health. Table 9: Thinking About Food The Issue Imagine that we want to encourage all Atlantic Canadians to develop a good personal health practice, such as healthy eating. We know that a healthy diet is important to our health, so we decide to provide information to Atlantic Canadians about healthy eating. To do this, we develop a brochure about healthy eating and distribute it through all large grocery store chains in the four Atlantic provinces. The Problem The problem with this approach is that it hasn't consider ed other determinants of health. Think about this: People with lower incomes often cannot afford to buy the foods needed for a healthy diet (such as fresh vegetables). Some people with less education and limited literacy skills can't read labels on food packages, so they are not sure which foods are better for them. These people may have trouble reading a brochure too. Some families do not have access to transportation, so they are unable to shop at large grocery store chains (which means the brochure would not reach them unless it was distributed at all small convenience type stores). Older people living alone may not want to buy food for themselves and may not like eating alone. Some families are from cultures that traditionally eat foods that are high in fat. They may not know how to make their traditional foods in a way that is healthy. These are just a few examples of why focusing only on one of the determinants of health is not enough. Potential Solutions In the brochure approach we started with above, we only focused on one determinant of health - personal health practices. But if we consider other determinants of health too, such as income and education, we would most likely come up with another approach. Maybe we would develop a community garden where people work together to grow low cost fresh fruit and vegetables. Or we might develop a partnership with our community literacy organization, and offer food label reading education to people who are enrolled in literacy classes. Or we might work with a group of people on fixed low incomes to enable them to influence policy-makers to increase income assistance to support healthy eating. The opportunities are endless!

The key elements are described below. Much of the info rmation in this section was taken directly from the resource: Healthy People, Healthy Communities: Using the Population Health Approach in Nova Scotia .34 Focus on the Health of Populations A population health approach shifts the fo cus away from changing individuals, to promoting healthier communities. Efforts are aimed at promoting health for the entire population, or large sub-populat ions, such as youth. Address the Determinants and Their Interactions A population health approach considers the full range of factors that influence health. Strategies to improve health carefully consider the determinants of health, such as income and social status, education, personal hea lth practices, social support networks, and supportive physical and social environments. Base Decisions on Evidence A population health approach uses information from a variety of sources to assess the health of the population, identify priorities fo r action, and develop strategies that improve health. The information used can come from baseline data collected through surveillance activities, from research st udies, and from the commun ity's knowledge about their existing strengths, resources and needs. Increase Upstream Investments A population health approach c onsiders the root causes of i llness and the conditions that create health. A population h ealth approach invests resour ces in actions that address factors that are known to have the greatest impact on health status, such as social, economic and environmental factors. The idea is that the further \"ups tream\" the action is, the greater the potential ga ins for population health. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 30 Apply Multiple Strategies A population health approach uses many differen t strategies to improve the health of the population. Strategies are impl emented in different settings too (e.g. schools, workplaces, communities). Collaborate Across Sectors and Levels A population health approach recognizes that taking action on the determinants of health requires the health sector to work closely with other sectors. For example, to take action on ensuring Canadians have an adequate income , organizations in the health sector need to work with organizations in the economic, education and social services sectors. Employ Mechanisms for Public Involvement A population health approach provides ci tizens with meaningful opportunities to participate in developing and implementing priorities for action to improve health. Increase Accountability for Health Outcomes A population health approach uses process, impact and outcome evaluation to focus on health outcomes, learning what changes in health are directly related to an intervention or program.37 This information is readily shared w ith Canadians as it is available. Considerations When Working with a Populat ion Health Approach The following list offers some additional considerat ions when using a population health approach in public health. Some groups are more affected by certain health issues than others. It is the public's responsibility to addres s the needs and concerns of all it s members, and to determine the physical and social value changes requ ired to improve the health of all. 38 Collaborative action and citizen engagement are crucial if communities truly want to address chronic disease and lifestyle.10 November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 31 The success of a population health appro ach depends on decision making that is \"...reasonable, open and transparent, incl usive, responsive and accountable\" (p.403).10 To achieve optimal health, communities must pr omote social justice and equity so that individuals are provided with opportunities to meet thei r physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual needs.38 To effectively address all the determinants that influence health requ ires the collaboration of many individuals, sectors and communities. As decisions are made to improve the health of the population, it is important that the impacts on all stakeholders are considered. Approaches to improving health mu st be flexible and adaptable to meet the needs of the many stakeholders affected.39 It should never be assumed that there is a lite ral, direct link between a health determinant and health status. For example, just because an individual is poor does not automatically mean the individual is ill. People differ in the way they experience their physical, social and emotional environments and it is important that we do not assume we know the health status of individuals based on health determinant information alone.39 The determinants should be used more as an indicator of pre- disposing factors to h ealth, and not used as definitive health predictors.39 Although much has been done in Canada to define a population health approach and to develop models for its implementation, much more work needs to be completed. It has been argued by some that the public health sector has most co mmonly only used a population health approach as an epidemiology tool looking at the hea lth status of communi ties and populations.40, 41 Some authors caution that more work needs to be done for the population health a pproach to truly begin to identify and address the social inequities which are at the root of many populations' health concerns.40-42 For links to more information on the populati on health approach, pl ease refer to Table 10.

Using a population health approach, public health in Canada works to maintain and improve the health status of populations, to reduce the exis tence of health dispar ities and reduce costs associated with the personal health system.1 To complete this work, the public health system in Canada fulfills five core functions. These are: Population Health Assessment; Health Surveillance; Health Promotion; Disease and Injury Prevention; and Health Protection. Population Health Assessment The public health system works to more fully understand what influences health and the impact of chronic diseases and chronic disease risk factors on the health of populations. Factors which contribute to good health and/or health risks are considered. 1 This work may involve investigating observed disease clusters, or the health effects of known hazard exposure.45 The results of population health assessment are used to prioritize and improve services and policies affecting the public. 1 Refer to Table 11 for examples of population health assessment. For links to more information regarding population health assessment, please refer to Table 12. Table 11: Examples of Population Health Assessment Examples of programming for the public health function of population health assessment include: Population/community health needs assessment; and Health status reports, system report cards.

This can be accessed at: http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=cphi_e Health Surveillance Using multiple sources and data systems at local, provincial, and national levels, the public health system regularly gathers, analyzes and interprets information about the health of the population. This information is used to make decisions, and to identify, monitor and communicate health issues within communities. 45 Health surveillance and epidemiology facilitate early identification of outbreaks and trends with illnesses and diseases, with a goal of providing earlier interv ention to reduce the negative impact on communities. Health surveillance is also used to monitor the impact of attempts to reduce disease risk factors and disease, and of efforts to improve health. 1 As an example, public health surveillance would detect that a new strain of E. coli was being repo rted in various parts of Canada within a short Table 13: Examples of Health Surveillance Examples of programming for the public health function of health surveillance include: Periodic health surveys; Cancer and other disease registries; Communicable disease reporting; Ongoing analysis of data to identify trends or emerging problems, (e.g. recognition of increasing syphilis cases); and Report to practitioners of increasing threat, what they need to look for, and intervention required.

This list is available at: http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/sehs- acss/recources_e.html Health Promotion The public health system works with partners to improve the health of individuals and communities through healthy public policy, co mmunity-based interventions and public engagement.1, 45 In 1986, the first International Confer ence on Health Promotion was held in Ottawa, Canada, where the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion was created. This charter defines health promotion as: \"...the process of enabling people to increa se control over, and to improve, their health. To reach a state of complete phys ical, mental and social well-being, an individual or group must be able to identify and real ize aspirations, to satisfy needs, and to change or cope with the envi ronment. Health is therefore, seen as a resource for everyday life, not the objective of livi ng. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and person al resources, as well as physical November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 36 capabilities. Therefore, h ealth promotion is not just the responsibility of the health sector, but goes beyond health y lifestyles to well-being\" (p.1)16. To complete health promotion work, the public h ealth system uses multiple strategies, some of which are briefly described below. Building Healthy Policy Health promotion is different from health care, in that it works to ensure the issue of health is considered by policy makers with in all sectors. It asks pol icy makers to think about the consequences of their sector's actions on the heal th of communities. Using health promotion as a common strategy, sectors are expected to collaborate, coordinating efforts to ensure the delivery of safer goods and services and cleaner environments.16 Creating Supportive Environments People's health is interconnected to their environm ents. It is crucial that we protect our natural environmental resources and our developed communities. Health promotion asks that throughout the world we work to support and respect e ach other's environments. Within our own communities, health promotion states to support our health, we must create and maintain healthy home, work and leisure environments. 16 Strengthening Community Action Health promotion recognizes that communities benefit from directing their own future and owning their actions to achieve improved health . When empowered to take action, communities set priorities, make decisions, plan and implement strategies to m eet identified health needs. Health promotion supports a community develo pment approach, where communities use their own material and human resource s to define needs and seek solutions to health issues.16 Community capacity building is an important concept to understand and implement when strengthening community action. Ca pacity building in public health is a term that is often used but poorly understood. People sometimes wonder what is meant by capacity and with whom November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 37 capacity should be built.50 Capacity building is an approach public health providers may use in collaboration with individuals, or ganizations and/or communities, to ensure that all individuals and sectors within the community (including public he alth) have the necessary skills, knowledge and resources required to address health issues51-54 Bopp et al. explain community capacity as: \"...the individual and collective capacities that a community needs in order to be able to effectively address the primar y determinants of health affecting the people in that place\" (p.7).55 Developing Pers onal Skills By providing information and education about he alth and life skills, he alth promotion supports the personal and social development of indivi duals. With appropriate knowledge and skills, people can take more control of their health and environments through all of life's stages.16 Re-Orienting Health Services Health promotion expects individuals, communities, health services, industries, and governments to work together across sectors to create a hea lth system that has an ultimate goal of pursuing health rather than mainly treating illness. Wh en offering health services, health promotion suggests that health providers br oaden their focus to more fully understand the impact of social, political, economic and physical environments on the health of indivi duals and communities.16 Table 15 provides examples of health prom otion and Table 16 suggests links to further information regarding health promotion. Table 15: Examples of Health Promotion Examples of programming for the public health function of health promotion include: Intersectoral community partnerships to solve health problems; Advocacy for h ealthy public policies; and Catalyzing the creation of physical and social environments to support health (e.g. bike paths, promoting access to social networks for se niors who are institutionalized). Taken from: Learning from SARS: Renewal of Public Health in Canada1 November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 38 Disease and Injury Prevention It is well-known that many chronic diseases and injuries could be prevented if societies and individuals applied the knowledge that readily exists about disease and injury prevention. This public health function cont ains actions such as promoting breastfeeding, healthy eating, smoking cessation, physical activity, falls prevention, and child safety.

Many regulations are in place in Canada to ensure health protection of communities. 1 Table 19 offers some examples of health protection. Further information regarding health protection is also suggested in Table 20.

It might also look at other determinants of health within the population that may be related to obesity, such as income and social status, geography, physical and social environments. Health surveillance is used to record obesity rates and associated long-term e ffects of obesity (e.g. diabetes, heart disease). Disease prevention strategies are offered to the population to encourage healthy eating. Through social marketing efforts and advocating for the reduction of costs for fresh fruits and vegetables, health promotion strategies are used. Health protection is also involved to reduce obesity, by regulating that food labels must inform consumers when transfats exist in processed foods. This example is modeled after an example found in: The Renewal of Public Health in Nova Scotia33 November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 42What are Public Health Principles? It appears there is not a definitive list of public health values or pr inciples that have been agreed upon in Canada. Kenny, Melnychuk and Asada offer a lis t of principles that have been discussed in the literature that are likely re levant to public health in Canada.10 It is important to note that considerable debate surrounds each of these principles, as scholars and providers discuss the ethics associated with their implementation. The Utilitarian or Utility Principle This principle is based on maximizing theory, wher eby an obligation exists to consider decisions and policies that create the greatest good for the greatest number of people.65 The Precautionary Principle This principle is used within the scientifically-b ased field of risk management. This principle recognizes that it is not always possible to ha ve complete scientific evidence about certain conditions. Therefore, this prin ciple acknowledges that decisions for action sometimes must be made without full scientific evid ence when there is a threat of serious or irreversible harm.66 The Principle of Least Restrictive Means This principle acknowledges that different actio ns can be taken to achieve public health outcomes, and these actions vary in the amount of power and control that government places over the population. This principle st ates that highly restrictive m eans should only be implemented after least restrictive me ans have been unsuccessful. For example, this principle expects that education and facilitation are means used to addr ess public health outcomes before regulation or incarceration is used. This principle also emphasi zes that actions used mu st be legal and must not discriminate between populations.67 The Reciprocity Principle This principle outlines that once public health actions are implemen ted that place restrictions on an individual or community, the public health syst em is expected to help the individual and/or November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 43community address their duties. For example, an individual may be requir ed to sacrifice time and income to comply with public health actions , and where possible the individual should be compensated for this sacrifice.67 The Transparency Principle This principle states that all decisions made regarding public h ealth action should be clear and transparent. The decision making process should a llow all appropriate stake holders to have equal input into the final decision.67 The Harm Principle This principle establishes the ab ility for governments to restrict the liberty of an individual or community when such action is nece ssary to prevent others from harm.67 Please refer to Table 22 for an example in public hea lth that illustrates the application of the harm principle, least restrictive mean s principle, and the reciprocity and transparency principles. Table 22: Example Illustrating the Applicatio n of Multiple Public Health Principles Smear Positive TB: A 35 year old homeless male is found to be smear positive for MTB. The man is frequently non-compliant with medication and uses shelters on nights when it is cold. In this case there is a potential for harm to others as someone smear positive for tuberculosis is capable of transmitting the disease. Sleeping in a crowded shelter is an opportunity for such a transmission to occur. Therefore the harm principle is met and action of some form is justifiable. In terms of limiting the harms, the least restrictive means principle would hold that public health officials start with attempts to educate and move progressively up through Directly Observed Therapy (DOTS), supportive housing, voluntary admission, to involuntary detention.1-3 The reciprocity principle holds that public health officials have an obligation to not just provide the man with options but facilitate the discharge of his obligations. Interventions such as DOTS and supportive housing are founded, in part, on the recognition of the need for such social reciprocity. Finally, guiding the entire process should be a clear and transparent communication including the provision of legal counsel if necessary (p.102). 1Annas GJ.

To unify stakeholders' actions a nd to assist with the development of an ethical framework, some authors suggest that a consistent li st of values or prin ciples should be created for public health in Canada. 10, 41, 67 One of these authors does caution a si ngle ethical framework based on principles alone will not likely suffice in public health, given that multiple viewpoints from different societies and cultures will often need to be a pplied to public health action affecting broad populations. 68 For additional reading on public health principles, please refer to Table 23.

Principles for the Justification of Public Health Intervention This article by Upshur also provides food for thought about public health principles and is available within the Canadian Journal of Public Health, 2002;93(2):101-103. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 45Public Health Governance In Canada, the federal, provincial and territori al governments, as well as regional or local governing bodies all share res ponsibility for developing a nd implementing public health policy. The different levels of government and governing bodies all collaborate to monitor, analyze and manage threats to public health and to promote the health of the public.69 Public health practiti oners are therefore interspe rsed throughout the system, working at a federal, provincial or regional/local level. Federal Level The federal government has authority over public h ealth questions and issues associated with foreign governments, multi-later al health agencies, trade, commerce and national borders.1, 69 It also is responsible for regulating hazardous and controlled substan ces as well as drugs and health products. The federal government also oversees h ealth services delivery including public health services to First Nations, inmates within the fe deral correctional system, the Canadian Military and the RCMP.8 At the federal level, the Public Health Agency of Canada guides work in public health, and this agency is lead by a Chief Public Health Officer.69 At the federal level, various pieces of legislation guid e public health practice. Provincial and Territorial Level Each province or territory has a public health act (or equivalent) with regulations that govern public health activities.26 Each jurisdiction may al so have additional, unique legislation that affects public health practice. Th e responsibility for delivering most front- line public health services primarily falls within provincial/territorial jurisdiction; however, in many provinces and territories the actual planning a nd delivery of public health services is often devolve d to a regional or local level. 26 At a provincial/territorial level, Chief Medical Officers of Health of ten lead public health initiatives. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 46Regional/Local Level At the regional or local level, often public health program a nd services are governed by an elected or appointed board (e.g. district health authorities).26 At the local level, Public Health Officers often lead public health initiatives. Public Health in Atlantic Canada The organization of public health within A tlantic Canada is complex; there are 24 different health authorities, and f our separate provincial governments.8 Other main stakeholders collaborating within public health are:8 Federal Governments; Non-Profit Organizations; Academic Institutions; and Researchers. Each jurisdiction has its own unique challenges to address, and they often have varying amounts of resources available to deliver public h ealth services. 8 Within Atlantic Canada, provincial public hea lth services are often organized to provide some services to targeted populations such as children or families , while other services are offered which span across populations on to pics such as health promotion, prevention of chronic disease, injury preven tion, addictions or healthy living. 8 The Public Health Agency of Canada has a re gional office within the Atlantic Region. This regional office collaborates with and s upports projects and initiatives aimed at understanding and implementing a population hea lth approach, often placing particular emphasis on vulnerable communities. 8 The Atlantic region offi ce's main areas of work fall within community capacity building, know ledge development and inter-sectoral collaboration.8 Table 24 provides web links to information related to public health efforts within Atlantic Canada.

Core competencies are the esse ntial knowledge, skills and attitude s necessary for the practice of public health. They transcend the boundaries of specific disciplines and are independent of program and topic. They provide the building blocks for effective public health practice, and the use of an overall public health approach. Generi c core competencies provide a baseline for what is required to fulfill public health system co re functions. These include population health assessment, surveillance, diseas e and injury prevention, health promotion and health protection. Why Do We Need Core Competencies? Core competencies may improve the health of the public by: contributing to a more effective workforce encouraging service delivery that is evidence based, population-focused, ethical, equitable, standardized and client-centred helping to create a more unified workfo rce by providing a shared understanding of key concepts and practices helping to explain the nature of publ ic health and public health goals. Core competencies will benefit the people who work in public health by: providing guidelines for the basic knowledge, skills and attitudes required by individual practitioners in public health supporting the recruitment, development and retention of public health practitioners providing a rational basis for developing curricula, training and professional development tools improving consistency in job descriptions and performance assessment supporting the development of discipline a nd program-specific sets of competencies. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 49Core competencies can help publ ic health organizations to: identify the knowledge, skills and attitudes re quired across an organi zation or program to fulfill public health functions supporting the recruitment, development and retention of public health practitioners help identify the appropriate numbers and mix of public health workers in a given setting identify staff development and training needs provide a rationale for securing f unds to support workforce development develop job descriptions, interview questions , and frameworks for evaluation and quality assurance facilitate collaboration, shared goals and interdis ciplinary work. How Were The Current Core Competencies Developed? Recent public health events have emphasized th e need to strengthen and develop the public health workforce. In their report - Building the Public Health Workforce for the 21st Century - The Federal/Provincial/Territorial Joint Task Group on Public Health Human Resources proposed a pan-Canadian framework to strengthe n public health capacity. Identifying core competencies was one of the foundationa l building blocks in that framework. In 2005, the Joint Task Group on Public Health Hu man Resources developed a draft set of core competencies. In its report, the Joint Ta sk Group on Public Health Human Resources recommended that the Public Health Agency of Canada undertake a national process to review and modify or validate these draft core comp etencies. Following preliminary consultation and discussion with public health stakeholders across the country, a s econd draft of core competencies was developed in 2006. This was enhanced by the development of a companion Glossary of Terms Relevant to the Core Competencies for Public Health . Appendix A is an edited version of this glossar y, which includes additions sugges ted in the review process. The second draft of the core competencies and th e glossary were shared and discussed with a large number of public health practitioners and wi th representatives of all levels of government. The extensive consultation process included: regional meetings across Canada November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 50 a pan-Canadian survey implementation pilots work with specific disciplines and professional organizations. The set of core competencies for public health workers in Canada in this document reflects the feedback and suggestions gained in the consultation. Who Are The Core Competencies For? Individuals with post-secondary tr aining in public health are expect ed to possess all of the core competencies at least at a basic level of prof iciency. Administrative staff and some other public health workers (such as community health repres entatives, out-reach workers and home visitors) are not expected to have all of the core competen cies listed in this document. They will have an appropriate sub-set of the compet encies, depending on their role. The core competencies primarily relate to the practice of individuals, including front line providers, consultants/specialists and managers/supervisors (see A ppendix B for a description of these roles). They can also serve as a tool for assessing and creating the be st mix of competencies for a public health team or organization. Ensuring that public health practitioners acquire and maintain competence and proficiency in all of the categories discussed in th is document is a shared respon sibility. Individuals must be supported and assisted by employers, professi onal organizations, edu cational institutions, regulatory bodies, unions, and govern ments at the federal, provincia l/territorial and local levels. Core Competency Statements The core competency statements are not designed to stand alone, but rath er to form a set of knowledge, skills and attitudes practi ced within the larger context of the values of public health. November, 2007 PH 101: An In troduction to Public Health Public Health 101 51Attitudes and Values All public health professionals share a core set of attitudes and values. These attitudes and values have not been listed as specific core competencies for public health because they are difficult to teach and even harder to assess. However, they form the context within which the competencies are practiced. This makes them equally important. Important values in public health include a commi tment to equity, social justice and sustainable development, recognition of the importance of the health of the community as well as the individual, and respect for diversity, self -determination, empowerment and community participation. These values are r ooted in an understanding of the br oad determinants of health and the historical principles, valu es and strategies of public health and health promotion. If the core competencies are considered as the no tes to a musical score, the values and attitudes that practitioners bring to thei r work provide the tempo and emotional component of the music. One may be a technically brilliant musician but without the correct tempo, rhythm and emotion, the music will not have the desired impact. Statements in Seven Categories The 36 core competencies are organized under seven categories: public health sciences; assessment and analysis; policy and program planning; implementation and evaluation; partnerships, collaboration and advocacy; diversity and inclusiveness; communication; leadership. Public Health Sciences This category includes key knowledge and critical thinking skills related to the public health sciences: behavioural and social sciences, bi ostatistics, epidemiology, environmental public health, demography, workplace health, and the prevention of chronic diseases, infectious diseases, psychosocial problems and injuries. Compet ency in this category requires the ability to apply knowledge in practice.
