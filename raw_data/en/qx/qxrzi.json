Here is a story to bring this Spirit Keeper alive to you [[1]](https://crystalvaults.com/medicine-wheel-guide/winds/mudjekeewis-spirit-keeper#_ftn1): Young Mudjekeewis was the greatest of all hunters amongst the native people of all the tribes of the world. One day as he hunted deep in the mountains, he came across a grizzly bear. However, this was no ordinary bear...it had the belt of wampum made from sacred shells and blessed beads, the ultimate symbol of peace and peacekeeper in his possession. Mudjekeewis took note of this discovery and how it could benefit him and his people. He stunned the grizzly and did battle until the bear was completely lifeless. As any great hero would, Mudjekeewis returned home and flaunted his new victory with the possession of the wampum belt. His fellow villagers praised his success and bravery, and gave him the title of Ruler of the Winds, and Spirit Keeper of the West Wind.
