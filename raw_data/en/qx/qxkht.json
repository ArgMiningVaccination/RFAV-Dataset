For Providers: You can submit an official referral via MHS Genesis for Mind Body Medicine. When making your referral, ensure it is routed as \"Health and Wellness: MBM\". This is considered a provider-referral, but your patients can also self-refer using the option above. What To Expect: First Steps Regardless of referral method, incoming patients will have a medical appointment with one of our RN Health Coaches. Together with the patient, our providers will assess the patient's needs and collaboratively develop a plan for next steps. This plan may include education classes, skill-building classes, or a mix of the two, and also includes other classes in the Health and Wellness Department. We recognize that medical providers are busy and in a constantly changing occupation. Due to this, we don't expect patients or providers to continually stay up-to-date on our offerings. Instead, this initial meeting with our RN Health Coaches will provide the most updated information about our classes and events. All you have to do is call the Health and Wellness Department's front desk (or refer your patients to use) to learn more: (619) 532-7764. What is Mind Body Medicine? \"Mind Body Medicine\" is an umbrella term that includes a wide range of activities, therapies, classes, and events aimed at supporting the holistic and biomedical wellness of patients. Similar terms to \"Mind Body Medicine\" that may be familiar are: integrative medicine, holistic health, whole health, and complementary medicine. About Mind Body Medicine Across the globe, many ancient cultures and civilizations believed in the healing power of the mind and the inherent connection between ourselves and our environments. With time and scientific advances, popular medicine shifted focus toward a treatment model that emphasized bodily health and under-emphasized mental health, emotional well-being, and the personal values of patients. Over the past 50 years, however, an ever-growing body of research has unveiled the immense power of the mind to impact our health. In fact, Mind Body Medicine is regularly used in evidence-based clinical guidelines for medical providers and these approaches are best used in tandem with biomedical services. Prevalence of Mind Body Medicine Mind Body approaches tend to be low-cost and easily personalized, which make them an attractive option for many people. Additionally, as time goes on, we learn more and more about the many ways that Mind Body Medicine can support health and wellbeing. Research done between 2013 and 2014 indicate that about 1 in 5 US adults (approximately 20%) report actively using at least 1 Mind Body technique within the previous 12 months of being asked. Furthermore, researchers found that meditation (a common Mind Body technique) has greatly increased in popularity. Between 2012 and 2017, the amount of US adults who meditated more-than tripled (prevalence data from Wolsko, Eisenberg, Davis, & Phillips [2004]).
