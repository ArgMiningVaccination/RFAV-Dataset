Inflammation most commonly occurs in the last section of the small or large intestine but it can affect any part of the digestive system. Common symptoms can include: - diarrhoea - abdominal pain - fatigue (extreme tiredness) - unintended weight loss - blood and mucus in your faeces (stools) Remission occurs when people with the disease go long periods of time without symptoms however these periods can be followed by flare ups of symptoms. Why it happens The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, research suggests a combination of factors may be responsible. These include: genetics - genes you inherit from your parents may increase your risk of developing Crohn's disease the immune system - the inflammation may be caused by a problem with the immune system that causes it to attack healthy bacteria in the gut previous infection - a previous infection may trigger an abnormal response from the immune system smoking - smokers with Crohn's disease usually have more severe symptoms than non-smokers environmental factors - Crohn's disease is most common in westernised countries such as the UK, and least common in poorer parts of the world such as Africa, which suggests the environment has a part to play Source: NHS Most watched News videos - [Animation shows how Leicester City owner's helicopter crashed](/video/uknews/video-3011535/Video-Animation-shows-Leicester-City-owners-helicopter-crashed.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Inside look at Delta flight after passenger had diarrhea](/video/news/video-3011529/Inside-look-Delta-flight-passengers-diarrhea.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Moment Ryanair chairman splattered with pies by Belgian eco-mob](/video/newsalerts/video-3012773/Video-Moment-Ryanair-chairman-splattered-pies-Belgian-eco-mob.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Man pushed into sea by ferry crew while trying to leap onto vessel](/video/greece/video-3011733/Video-Man-pushed-sea-ferry-crew-trying-leap-vessel.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Rishi Sunak's statement about prison escape of records helicopter](/video/russiaukraineconflict/video-3011761/Video-Ukrainian-troops-blasting-Russian-helicopter.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Public catch 'watch thief' and pin him in Sloane Square](/video/crime/video-3012673/Video-Public-catch-watch-thief-pin-chair-Sloane-Square.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Former detective: Fugitive ex-soldier may already have fled country](/video/crime/video-3012533/Video-Former-detective-Fugitive-ex-soldier-fled-country.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [William and Kate receive flowers from kids outside St Davids Cathedral](/video/katemiddleton/video-3013659/Video-William-Kate-receive-flowers-kids-outside-St-Davids-Cathedral.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Mark Rowley says Daniel Khalife escape could have been an inside job](/video/crime/video-3013349/Video-Mark-Rowley-says-Daniel-Khalife-escape-inside-job.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Heartbreaking footage of a dog stranded on a roof in Greece](/video/greece/video-3012727/Video-Heartbreaking-footage-dog-stranded-roof-Greece.html?mwv_rm=rta) The comments below have not been moderated.
