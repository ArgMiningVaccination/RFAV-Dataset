Relevant outcomes include improvement in core ASD impairments, such as communication, social awareness, sensory sensitivities and repetitiveness; skills such as social functioning and play; participation outcomes such as social inclusion; and parent and family impact. Objectives: To examine the measurement properties of tools used to measure progress and outcomes in children with ASD up to the age of 6 years. To identify outcome areas regarded as important by people with ASD and parents.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

We undertook systematic review of tools used in ASD early intervention and observational studies from 1992 to 2013; systematic review, using theCOSMIN checklist (Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments) of papers addressing the measurement properties of identified tools in children with ASD; and synthesis of evidence and gaps. The review design and process was informed throughout by consultation withstakeholders including parents, young people with ASD, clinicians and researchers. Results: The conceptual framework developed for the review was drawn from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, including the domains 'Impairments ','Activity Level Indicators ','Participation ', and 'Family Measures '. In review 1, 10,154 papers were sifted -3091 by full text -and data extracted from 184; in total, 131 tools were identified, excluding observational coding, study-specific measures and those not in English. In review 2, 2665 papers were sifted and data concerning measurement properties of 57 (43%) tools were extracted from 128 papers. Evidence for the measurement properties of the reviewed tools was combined with information about their accessibility andpresentation. Twelve tools were identified as having the strongest supporting evidence, the majority measuring autism characteristics and problem behaviour. The patchy evidence and limited scope of outcomes measured mean these tools do not constitute a 'recommended battery 'for use. In particular, there is little evidence that the identified tools would be good at detecting change in intervention studies.The obvious gaps in available outcome measurement include well-being and participation outcomes for children, and family quality-of-life outcomes, domains particularly valued by our informants (young people with ASD and parents). Conclusions: This is the first systematic review of the quality and appropriateness of tools designed to monitor progress and outcomes of young children with ASD. Although it was not possible to recommend fully robust tools at this stage, the review consolidates what is known about the field and will act as a benchmark for future developments. With input from parents and other stakeholders, recommendationsare made about priority targets for research. Future work: Priorities include development of a tool to measure child quality of life in ASD, and validation of a potential primary outcome tool for trials of early social communication intervention.

First, we asked people what they thought it was important to measure. Parents, and children and adults with autism, told us that happiness, anxiety and sensory overload were most important. Health and education staff said they needed tools to measure areas of difficulty. This was because these are importantwhen deciding whether a child has autism, and in finding out what things help them. Next we found all of the published studies that tracked the progress of children with autism, to find out what tools researchers had used. Between them, these studies used 131 tools, so we then looked for studies that told us how good these tools were when used with children with autism. We found tools that could be used to monitor some aspects of the progress of young children with autism but not all. There was little or no evidence about whether tools that describe children 's social participation and well-being are useful for children with autism. We found good evidence for the usefulness of a smallnumber of tools that measure autism characteristics and behaviour problems. When we showed theseto parents and professionals at a Discussion Day, they pointed out flaws, such as unclear wording and crowded presentation of questionnaires. New research is needed to improve this situation. Valued outcomes to assess include social communication skills, well-being and quality of family life.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

ASD is common, affecting at least 1% of the child and adult population. The ASD early intervention literature is largely focused on the promotion of social communication skills andmanagement of coexisting behaviour problems. One difficulty for the interpretation of research findings is the multitude of different measurement tools that have been used in collecting evidence of progress and outcomes. The tools are of varying relevance and with limited evidence of their measurement propertieswhen used with young children with ASD. Review questions and objectives The aims of the MeASURe (Measurement in Autism Spectrum disorder Under Review) review were toidentify the validity of tools and outcome measures used in measuring and monitoring young childrenwith ASD, and to consider how well these reflect and measure issues of importance for patients and carers. To achieve this, our objectives were to: lidentify the tools reported in literature on quantitative research involving children with ASD up to theage of 6 years lconduct a detailed systematic review of the measurement properties of tools within the major domains of development and functioning lsynthesise evidence regarding the most robust and useful tools in these different domains lidentify gaps in measurement of outcomes and make research recommendations. These steps were undertaken in the context of understanding what people with ASD, and parents, thought should be measured, and their perspectives about some of the better tools. Methods Framework for what outcomes to measure To consider the outcomes of importance for parents and other key stakeholders, we consulted with people with ASD, parents and professionals. We were guided by the evidence-based procedures fordeveloping a core outcome set outlined by the UK Medical Research Council-funded Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials initiative. As ASD is complex, and the review needed to take account of the developmental context of measuring outcomes up to the age of 6 years, we placed the findings of theconsultation stages in a conceptual framework to guide the full review of tools for measurement. For theMeASURe conceptual framework, there were four primary domains, with subdomains in each of impairments, activity level indicators, participation and family measures.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

What is it important for professionals toknow about children with autism before they start to test them? lThird, we undertook a survey through networks of health and education professionals to explore what constructs are most often measured by early years professionals in monitoring children 's progress. lFourth, we consulted with parents at meetings (Exeter, London, Newcastle) on three occasions during the review process to establish which outcomes that parents consider to be most important. lFinally, at the end of the review process, we held a discussion day with multiple stakeholders about thepreliminary conclusions of the review, regarding what outcomes are important and how toassess them. Systematic reviews First systematic search Thefirst systematic search was undertaken to determine the range of tools used in observational and intervention evaluation studies in ASD, and relate these tools to the subdomains of the conceptual framework adopted for the MeASURe project. Search strategy We included studies published from 1992 to coincide with the publication of the then-current international classifications, International Classification of Diseases , 10th Edition (ICD-10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Original searches were conducted in June and July 2012, and re-run in June and July 2013.A total of 3059 papers were examined at full text and, from these, 255 papers were identified as appropriate for potential inclusion. There was a further stage of sifting of records found during the search of papers about measurement properties of tools, with searches completed by 9 September 2013. After exclusions, a total of 184 papers had information about tools extracted. The following study types were included: lall relevant randomised and quasi-randomised trials of early interventions lcross-sectional and case -control studies of children ldescriptive cohort studies, including studies of baby siblings of children with autism, which provide information on tools to monitor developmental progress and follow early markers of ASD.SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukxxivChild characteristics We reviewed all studies in which at least 50% of children included had ASD operationalised as a 'best estimate 'clinical diagnosis of ASD, including autism, ASD, atypical autism, Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder -not otherwise specified, according to either ICD-10 or DSM-IV criteria. All children were aged 6 years upon entering the study. Types of measurement included 1. Direct assessment of child ASD symptoms by trained assessor. 2. Direct measurement of developmental skills, i.e. language, cognition, fine and gross motor skills, by trained assessor. 3. Observational measures of social interaction skills.4. Interview or self-completed (parent, teacher or other professional) questionnaire report of child ASD symptoms. 5. Interview or self-completed questionnaire report of developmental skills -for example, language or adaptive skills -with/by parent, teacher or other professional. 6. Interview or self-completed (parent, teacher or other professional) questionnaire report of co-existing problems, including behaviour, aggression, sleeping, eating, toileting, anxiety, hyperactivity and others identified through parent consultation. 7. Idiographic measures focused on particular behaviours (e.g. goal attainment scaling, target behaviours). 8. Measures of impact on parent or family. Types of measurement not included lEconomic impact on home and family. lExperimental tasks and measures, for example barrier tasks, reaction time. lBiophysical measures, medical investigations. lProcess measures. Second systematic search Thesecond systematic search was undertaken to find papers that report the measurement properties of identified tools. Not all tools identified for monitoring or outcome measurement could be searched for by name. First, a number of tools had been developed for a particular study (such as a coding system for parent- child interaction). Second, some tools were translations or adaptations of tools for use in another country, or had been used only up to 1994, and these were not pursued further for the purposes of this review. Original searches for papers describing measurement properties were conducted in March and April 2013, with follow-up searches completed in November 2013. The databases searched were Education ResourcesInformation Center PsycINFO (Ovid) -1987 to present. In order to search for papers describing studies of measurement properties of tools, a specific search filterdeveloped by the COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments) group was applied. Each search consisted of four components: autism terms, age group terms, COSMIN filter and tool name. Searches were limited to English language only, and papers published from 1992 to present.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Tool identified in first search was the focus. 2. Tool (or subscales) measured a domain from the 'conceptual framework '. 3. Study published as 'full-text original article '. 4. The study sample overlapped with the age range of 0 -6 years. 5. The study sample could be individuals who were being monitored for ASD symptoms even if they had another primary diagnosis (e.g. a paper monitoring ASD symptoms in a Fragile X population could be eligible if exploring measurement properties of a tool used as an outcome). 6. The aim of the study was the development of a measurement tool or the evaluation of one or more of its measurement properties. Exclusion criteria 1. Papers in which the measurement tool was tested only for its properties in diagnostic assessment or screening. 2. A sample drawn from only the general population of children. 3. Sample size of <20. 4. With regard to papers on translated tools, if the purpose was simply to validate the translated version then it was not eligible. If the purpose was to explore the tool 's validity in a different culture/country, the focus was on the properties of the tool and the findings appeared relevant for use in UK then it was included. Results Understanding the views of people with autism spectrum disorder, parents and professionals around the measurement of outcomes of importance to them We found a striking difference between the constructs rated important by parents, and the constructs most frequently measured by health and education professionals. We found that parents' experience with their children leads them to emphasise outcomes such as child emotional well-being as affecting the wholefamily. Professionals acknowledged that they measure what they have the tools for, and that their practiceis influenced by an emphasis on the core impairments in autism and behaviour that challenge, rather than necessarily seeing the broader picture and measuring how the child is affected by their environment. Thus the consultation did not produce, at this stage, 'consensus 'across stakeholder groups about what outcomes are most important to measure in young children with ASD. Systematic reviews to determine tools in use, and their measurement properties Of the 132 named tools that were identified as eligible for inclusion in searches about papers on their measurement properties, no papers meeting inclusion criteria were found for 75 tools and thereforetheir measurement properties in use with children with ASD could not be examined further. Fifty-seventools (43%) remained, for which evidence on measurement properties was obtained. The detailed data extraction using the COSMIN checklist provided some positive evidence with regard to at least one measurement property for 41 tools (seven with various versions/editions) identified as being used to measure outcome at stage 2 of the review. The tools are grouped by primary conceptual framework domain: Autism symptom severity : Autism Behavior Checklist; Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R); Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS, including Toddler Module and Calibrated Severity Score); Autism Observation Scale for Infants; The Baby and Infant Screen for Children with aUtIsm Traits-Part 1SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukxxvi(BISCUIT); Behavioral Summarized Evaluation (BSE-R; including Revised and Infant); Childhood Autism Rating Scale; Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS and GARS-2); Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers; Parent Observation of Early Markers Scale; Pervasive Developmental Disorders Rating Scale; Social CommunicationQuestionnaire; Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS).

Parent stress Autism Parenting Stress Index; Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF); Questionnaire on Resources and Stress-Friedrich Short Form.The most evidence was gathered for tools that were developed especially for use with children with ASD. Content validity of these tools was accepted for this review as strong. Unfortunately, given the focus of the review, there was minimal evidence about which tools have capacity to track children 's progress over time or in response to an intervention. In the case of standardised assessments (e.g. of language, cognition and play) and many questionnaires (e.g. assessing behaviour, attention and emotional regulation) developed for the general population, there was limited evidence of their measurement properties when used with orabout young children with ASD. We found no evidence concerning tools that can describe and measuresome of the aspects of children 's social participation and well-being (valued by parents as important). Also, we have no evidence about measures of family quality of life, although there is some evidence aboutmeasures of parent stress.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

A tension between the diagnostic process in ASD, and the focus on parent and professional valued outcomes, was evident. The synthesis of evidence took into account the availability of tools,stakeholder views about the presentation of tools, the age range covered and the extent of the positiveevidence about measurement properties in use with children with ASD. In summary, just 12 tools were considered the most valid overall; however, given their scope and limitations, these should not be considered a 'recommended battery '. These PSI-SF. Research recommendations in order of priority 1. Development of a tool to measure child quality of life, with careful content validation for children with ASD. 2. Assessment of the measurement properties of a newly developed tool, the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change, by research group(s) in the UK, which has apparent promise as a primary outcome for early intervention trials focused on improving social communication in young children with ASD. 3. Further studies of the measurement properties of the VABS in young children with ASD in the UK. 4. Assessment of the measurement properties of the UK Early Years Foundation Stage Profile for use with young children with ASD. 5. Development of a questionnaire tool appropriate for young children with ASD to measure repetitive behaviour and circumscribed interests, which can be used across settings. 6. Assessment of the measurement properties of tools developed for young children with ASD which focus on problems such as anxiety and sleep. 7. Establishment of an agreed core set of outcomes to be measured in effectiveness trials of early intervention in ASD. Study registration This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42012002223.

The burden and cost to the individual, family and broader society are very high, with the economic costs in the UK estimated to be \u00a328B per year.5 In light of increased awareness about the prevalence of ASD, and the emphasis on early identification and diagnosis, it is important that health, education and social-care services provide evidence-based interventions and early support for individuals with ASD, and their families, carers and teachers. In the pastdecade there has been an increase in ASD intervention research, with recent improvement in the quality of studies. 6,7The ASD early intervention literature is largely focused on promotion of social communication skills, with less emphasis on interventions for restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRBs). It also includes interventions focused on the high rates of co-occurring behaviours and problems (e.g. sleep, faddiness about food, aggression to others, toileting difficulties).8,9One problem for the interpretation of research findings is the multitude of different measurement tools that have been used in collecting evidence of progress and outcomes. Furthermore, longitudinal studies highlight the variation in individual developmental pathways.10-12The changes in prevalence are due, in part, to earlier recognition of ASD in children in the average range of ability, with likely effects on the pattern of outcomes.13The literature thus presents a large set of measures, inconsistently used, of varying relevance and with variable or indeed no evidence of their psychometric properties. What should be measured? There are several ways to consider the question of what to measure, including what government departments need in order to measure progress and outcomes, what matters to parents and individuals with ASD, and the theoretical basis of ASD, which has implications regarding important domainsto measure. The UK Chief Medical Officer 's 2012 report focused on Child Health, 14and discussed the poor educational, health and employment outcomes for children with neurodisability. In recent years, there has been consultation about the UK National Health Service Outcomes Framework 2011/12,15part of a strategy that aims to deliver 'the outcomes that matter most to people' , using patient-reported outcome measures. The Kennedy report 'Getting It Right for Children and Young People'16highlighted the need to identify a common vision between families and professionals for what services are seeking to achieve for children.Measuring outcomes that are valued by families is central to that vision, which, in turn, will influence what services are provided and how, and potentially what services and interventions are prioritised for researchevaluation. A recent National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) study has reported agreement on what are the valued outcomes of care for children with neurodisability, 17but it is not clear whether or not these would be the same if a set of core outcomes were sought specifically for children with ASD.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

To achieve this we have: lidentified the tools reported in literature on quantitative research involving children of up toapproximately 6 years of age with ASD (see Chapter 3 ) lconducted a detailed systematic review of the measurement properties of tools within the major domains of development and functioning (see Chapter 4 ) lsynthesised evidence regarding the most robust and useful tools in these different domains (see Chapter 5 ) lidentified gaps in measurement of outcomes and made research recommendations. An important part of the strategy has been to identify what people on the autism spectrum, and parents of children with ASD, think should be measured. As these stakeholders were involved at various stages throughout the project, there is no single section on 'patient and public involvement 'in the report. Instead, parents and people on the autism spectrum have contributed particularly to Chapters 2 ,5and 6. InChapter 2 , we address the issue of what outcomes should be measured.MEASURE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk2Chapter 2 Development of the conceptual framework Introduction Within the MeASURe project, we carried out a series of consultations with stakeholders, including professionals, parents of children with ASD and people on the autism spectrum, and a scoping review of qualitative literature. The aim was to identify (1) what outcomes should be measured when monitoring the progress of young children with ASD and (2) whether there is agreement between parents andprofessionals about the relative importance of what to measure. The review of how to measure those outcomes in order to progress towards an agreed battery of tools is presented in later chapters. The chapter is structured to incorporate: 1. general considerations for developing a conceptual framework in ASD for the review 2. findings from scoping relevant qualitative research with families 3. consultation with people who are on the autism spectrum4. survey consultation with professionals 5. consultation with parents 6. consultation with multiple stakeholders at a Discussion Day. Valued outcomes There exist recommended procedures for agreeing what should be a core set of outcomes in various fieldsof health care. As Williamson et al. 18note, 'insufficient attention has been paid to the outcomes measured in clinical trials '. Consistency and interpretation will be improved if researchers always collect and report on core outcomes. The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative funded by theMedical Research Council Network of Hubs for Trials Methodology Research aims to develop a set ofevidence-based procedures for developing a core outcome set. The suggested steps involve: lStep 1 Agree the scope of the area of health care. lStep 2 Identify existing knowledge about outcomes. lStep 3 Involve key stakeholders, including patients and health-care providers. lStep 4 Develop consensus about what to measure. Techniques for doing this in an inclusive and objective way are outlined in Williamson et al.,18including how to determine when consensus has been achieved. A systematic review of studies that aimed to determine which outcomes to measure in clinical trials in children concluded that in most specialties no research had been undertaken.19 The scope for this review was determined in the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) commissioning brief (i.e. COMET step 1) and includes a potentially broader use of outcomes than only in trials. This chapter presents the work undertaken on steps 2 and 3, i.e. to identify priorities for child outcomes as valued by parents and professionals, and as explored in qualitative literature. Because of the complexity of ASD as adisorder, and the developmental context of measuring outcomes up to the age of 6 years, the MeASURe review adopted a further step of placing the findings of the consultation stages in a conceptual framework to guide the full review of tools for measurement. This framework also guided further consultation withstakeholders about the relative importance of outcomes to measure. MeASURe did not undertake a further formal process to develop consensus (step 4 above). It may be that 'consensus 'would be hard to achieve but it would require further procedures. In principle, the choice of outcomes to focus upon depends on the specific research question being asked, and on what is important to particular groups of stakeholders.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

The conceptual framework should also be influenced by an understanding of ASD. The behavioural characteristics of ASD are underpinned by genetic, brain structure and neuropsychological differences from typical development.21The conclusions of many studies have led to the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -Fifth Edition (DSM-5) published in May 2013, such that the impairments in ASD are best considered within two groupings: social/communication difficulties andrestricted/repetitive interests and behaviours, including hypo- or hyper-responsiveness to sensory stimuli.The aetiological underpinnings for each of these broad domains of impairments may be different, and both may be targets for interventions targeting 'core 'features of autism. Another aspect of complexity in the understanding of ASD is that its measurement is affected by developmental considerations, i.e. children 's profile of skills and difficulties may look very different over time, and those trajectories will also be affected by levels of ability. As an obvious example, we cannotmeasure children 's social ability to make and keep friendships with validity until they are of an age at which that might be expected in typical development. However, there is some recent agreement on the core early impairments that may be observed. By the age of 2 years, differences in the development of children with ASD (from typically developing children and those with developmental delay) are evident inbehaviours such as fearfulness, frustration and lack of co-operation, quick mood changes, and fine and gross motor skills. 22This knowledge has been enhanced by recent studies of the early development of baby siblings of children with autism (who have an increased chance of themselves developing ASD); for example, Zwaigenbaum et al.23,24reported unusual eye contact, a lack of visual attention, orientating to name, imitation, social interest and emotional affect, and heightened sensory-orientated behaviours. Thesecombinations of deficits have consequences for development of relationships, early language and play,and, in turn, for the content and targets of early intervention. The complexity of understanding ASD is made even greater when considering the interaction between domains of development, and how deficits in one may impact upon another; for example, visual sensoryoverload may lead to avoidance, which reduces opportunities for visual learning and social experience, leading to poor social skills. Furthermore, there is evidence that pragmatic skills (such as social timing in interaction) are closely associated with particular types of behavioural profiles. 25,26Thus the conceptual framework for a review of outcome tools should consider both measurement of individual areas of functioning, which are likely to change over time, and also tools that bring together these separate areas into a more holistic assessment. It is particularly important to be able to create profiles for children withASD, who often have difficulties in generalising learning between areas of skill and also generalising skills from one setting to another. It is also important to detail other associated difficulties that are not unique to ASD but which, nevertheless, can play a major part in children 's development and the burden of care for families. These commonly include feeding and eating difficulties (resistance to certain food textures, faddiness about types and colours of food,etc.), behaviour and sleeping problems. Children who lack adequate nutrition and sleep are likely to be badtempered and even more rigid in their thinking and behaviour. Furthermore, adaptive functioning may be more impaired in children with ASD than would be expected from their level of ability. Finally, as young children 's development is intimately affected by their environment, including the health, skills and resilience of parents and carers, it is important to include consideration of the impact on the family. Although the conceptual framework developed over the process of consultation, and was informed by the separate activities described below, it is presented first for brevity and clarity ( Table 1 ).

Scoping review of qualitative literature (BB, NL, CM) Question What child- and/or family-specific outcomes do parents of children with ASD perceive as important? Methods Search strategy A systematic search was conducted (7 June 2012) using: lMEDLINE: 1948 to current lCumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL): 1937 to current lPsycINFO: 1806 to current. Blocks of search terms were assembled for ASD (block 1) and Qualitative Study Designs (block 2), tailored to each database (see Appendix 2 ). Papers were selected if they identified themes concerning parents' aspirations or desired outcomes for their children, experience of assessment of their children, and their priorities for intervention for, andeducation of, their children. Papers were excluded if (1) ASD was not outlined in the paper as a specificfocus (e.g. if 'developmental disabilities 'were the conditions of interest); (2) they did not involve parents (e.g. a paper interviewing parents and teachers would be included; a paper interviewing just teachers wasexcluded); (3) the focus was on parents 'views and hopes for their adult children with ASD (e.g. focus must be on parents/carers of young children); and (4) the paper was not in English. Abstracts and titles of references retrieved by the electronic searches were screened for relevance by one reviewer only (NL); two reviewers (BB, CM) then screened these titles and abstracts, and retrieved full texts for included papers. Data synthesis In order to present an overview to the parent advisory groups and the research team, key findings (including illustrative quotes) and analytical frameworks from each paper were extracted and tabulated,and themes identified. Results Searches identified 102 relevant papers. Fourteen studies were selected as sufficiently relevant to obtain afull text of the paper. Three of these were excluded because they did not collect qualitative data on outcomes; four were excluded because they contained no data on outcomes. Seven articles remained. It was clear from an initial inspection of these articles that the quality of data was variable and ranged in focus/topic. Three articles reported data relevant to only parent outcomes, 31-33including process outcomes. Three articles reported data relevant to child outcomes only34-36and one reported both.37One studyDEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk6included data collected directly from children and young people with ASD,34although original quotes from children were not presented. The age range of children represented in these studies was 0 -21 years. Just two studies31,33focused specifically on younger children (3 -6y e a r s ;31up to 5 years33). The diagnoses represented in the studies typically relied on parental reports. Two studies35,37focused on particular diagnostic groups (Asperger syndrome;37ASD with no functional communication35) and others were defined in terms of use of a particular service (speech-and-language therapy;31assessment and diagnosis;32preschool educational intervention33). Data collection methods included focus groups, individual face-to-face interviews and open-ended/free-text questions within postal and web-based surveys. Although we did not appraise quality of studies formally (using any standard checklist), the quality of reporting sampling and recruitment, data collection methods and data analysis processes was extremely variable. Given the significant limitations, in terms of quality and relevance, a 'light touch' data extraction was undertaken to identify outcomes and themes (see Appendix 2 ). In terms of child outcomes, it was notable that some aspects deemed 'fundamental 'by parents may not be regularly assessed (such as 'safety '),34and certainly not as an outcome of an early intervention trial. 'Awareness of danger 'was added to the conceptual framework (subdomain Social inclusion) as a fundamental issue of safety. The parents 'and young people' s emphasis on participation outcomes (such as being 'isolated from peers 'or'live a normal life' ) may also not be reflected in what is usually measured. Constructs concerning child and parent stress, and positive mental health36,37were supported as important to include as outcome constructs in the conceptual framework. In addition, parents often highlighted the processes of interaction with professionals, and the utility of information from assessments. Parents expected the service to provide them with information and researchliterature; to involve them in decision-making processes; and to teach parents how to deliver therapies athome. 31Braiden et al.32reported that parents 'desired information relevant and applicable to their child to assist them in understanding and making sense of their own child' s presentation '. They also mentioned wanting to have positive times with their child: 'when he is behaving well and not gearing up for a fight, he's a very happy and pleasant child '.37Such parent priorities have informed the conclusions of the MeASURe project.

In Birmingham, six adults were known to the University and responded by e-mail;10 children were approached by a member of the Autism Outreach Team and were selected on the basis that they were thought able to give their views on the questions. In Newcastle, two children attending a National Autistic Society social group responded in person and, likewise, two young adults attending asocial inclusion group. Responses to the questions were thus received from 12 young people aged9-15 years, and from eight adults aged 22 -43 years. Each respondent was given a shopping voucher in acknowledgement of their contribution. The verbatim responses were collated and commonthemes extracted. Results Outcomes Responses showed that young people had a good knowledge of the areas that were likely to be affected in autism (e.g. eye contact, social skills and communication) and those likely to be measured(e.g. intellectual level). However, some of the respondents emphasised outcomes that may not usually beprioritised by professionals or researchers (the subdomains into which these suggestions fit are shown within parentheses): lHow they respond to change in their lives (Restricted, repetitive behaviour); whether they are unhappyin a room because it might be dirty (Restricted, repetitive behaviour; Sensory processing); ability to sit still -if fidgety (Attention); whether they get angry easily (Emotional regulation); whether they like talking to people (Social functioning); how long it takes for information to stick (Learning); ability to make friends (Social relations); do they hang around with popular kids so that they are popular? (Social inclusion). Areas that were mentioned most often by the adults as important to assess included special interests andsensory issues, and social interaction to a lesser extent. Some respondents stressed the importance oftrying to understand the rationale for a young child 's repetitive actions or special interests. Process Many of the respondents emphasised the need to observe children, and for that observation to take placein more than one setting, as behaviour may be very different in different places. Tests (i.e. series of standard tasks) might be 'alright 'if they are interesting, and given in manageable-length sessions. Some adults on the autism spectrum were concerned that the use of normed tests or checking against typical milestones leads to negative conclusions, because developmental trajectories of children on the autism spectrum may be atypical and strengths may be missed. Respondents suggested that those administering tests should not assume instructions are clear and have the same meaning for a child with ASD, and thattesting should happen in a place where the child is comfortable. Respondents expressed the view that people who do assessments should find out about children before assessing them. One child said: 'Ask the child to show them what they like to do, e.g. jigsaws, lego '. They also felt that parents and support staff should be asked about special interests, motivators, sensory issues, and so on, and also about any events that have happened recently which may be affecting the child. One adult emphasised the need to be mindful of a child' s self-esteem: 'So much of the time assessment is done in terms of measuring deficits against a supposed \"normal \"or\"ideal \". . . I had a feeling of being 'different 'or'wrong 'from approximately the age of 3 years '.DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk8Survey of professionals working with early years children with autism spectrum disorder (GJ, JRP) Question What constructs are most often measured by early years professionals in monitoring children 's progress? Methods A survey was undertaken in autumn 2012 through the British Academy of Childhood Disability database of 240 UK Child Development Teams. Professionals were sent an electronic link to a web-based survey that took 10 minutes to complete. In parallel, education professionals received the survey via (1) '4 Children ',a national charity and UK Government strategic partner for early years and child care, through their database of 15,000 Early Years providers across England; (2) the database of an independent specialist centre for early years children with ASD; and (3) 150 practitioners undertaking the Birmingham University School ofEducation Autism Programme residential weekend. The survey had five sections. Respondents were asked: 1. About their profession, and the setting in which they work. 2.'Do you regularly work with children on the autism spectrum (this includes any activity that aims to improve/change an area of functioning)? 'and 'Do you ever measure the progress or outcomes of children on the autism spectrum (i.e. more than just seeing the child once for assessment)? '. Those who indicated 'yes'were given access to the rest of the questions. 3. To identify all areas in which they formally measure or informally make judgements about progress or outcomes for children on the autism spectrum whom they see more than once, and who are aged6 years. The 68 outcome constructs included were taken from the conceptual framework. 4. To indicate how frequently (on a six-point scale) they used different types of tool: standardised measures of progress or outcome (with manual and comparative age-related information);non-standardised measures (either published or created locally); informal judgements. 5. To give the three areas in which they most frequently measure progress over time, or outcome, with which of the three types of tools. Results The 836 respondents included 167 health professionals (paediatricians, speech-and-language therapists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, dietitians, health visitors, social workers and educational psychologists), 353 education professionals (teachers, special educational needs co-ordinators, autism education advisors, teaching assistants, intervention practitioners), 125 nursery nurses and191 other professionals, many of whom were childminders. Professionals worked in a variety of settings. Many health professionals worked in child development centres or hospitals but some were based mainly in educational settings. Education staff were from mainstream and specialist schools or early years settings. Five hundred and thirty-seven professionals monitored the progress or outcome of children who were seen more than once, and were able to access the remainder of the survey. Professionals were more likely to measure characteristics such as amount of speech (76%), social interaction (90%) and attention (79%) than life or adaptive skills (measuring for, or trying on, clothes 6%, difficulties with appointments, e.g. hairdresser, dentist 16%, use of knife and fork 29%), features relatedto'quality of life' for the child (quality of life 21%, happiness 42%) or the family (nature of sibling relationship 18%, family quality of life 22%, impact on the family 33%). Professionals were more likely to use their 'own informal judgement in discussion with parents or other professionals 'than standardised measures to rate improvements (442 respondents agreed with 'used often ','most of the time 'or'always 'compared with 253 who checked 'never ','rarely 'or'sometimes '). The specific types of measures used varied very widely due to the broad range of professional respondents.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

(The standardised tools identified as used most frequently were laterincluded in searches in Chapter 4 .) In conclusion, this survey found that professionals are most likely to measure features related to coreimpairment subdomains of autism, rather than aspects of daily living, family functioning, and childwell-being and happiness. Consultation with parents (DG, PG, AS le C, CM) Question What outcomes do parents consider as important to be assessed? Methods Parent advisory groups were recruited at three sites (Exeter, South London, Newcastle). In Exeter, thePeninsula Cerebra Research Unit involves families of disabled children as partners in research through a Family Faculty. 38Parents of children with ASD were e-mailed and invited to volunteer: 12 expressed interest and seven participated in one or more meetings. In London, the Newcomen Neurodisability Team involves families of children with ASD in giving advice on an ad hoc basis; for MeASURe, 10 parents were invited by e-mail and six participated in one or more meetings. In Newcastle, parents of children with ASD aged10 years were invited by e-mail; four participated in one or more meetings. Thus a total of 17 parents were involved in discussion meetings. Parents were given a financial acknowledgement in addition to travel expenses, to recognise their time and expertise at each attendance. Meetings were held at three points during the MeASURe project. Early meeting To explore parents 'priorities and experiences of assessment and identify what outcomes parents saw as important, especially for monitoring their young child with ASD over time. This session involved an explanation of the aims of the project and open discussion, led by a member of the projectteam and a parent involvement co-ordinator. Mid-point meeting To undertake a Q-sort of constructs emerging from the conceptual framework. Two members of the MeASURe project team (NL, GM) created 'lay wording 'versions of the constructs. Sixty-two constructs were presented on cards in a jumbled order (i.e. not including symptom severity, physical indicators, global measure of function, global measure of outcome). The way in which theconstructs had been chosen was introduced by the project team member. Through discussion within the parent group, the constructs were sorted on to a 'forced-choice 'grid in a pyramid shape on a large piece of paper. Columns on the grid were rated for levels of importance (from 'more 'to'less'on an 11-point scale), i.e. 'the importance of various things which could be measured when tracking the progress of children with autism aged up to 6 years, or in measuring the outcome of a specific preschool intervention '. It was stressed that none of the constructs was considered unimportant. End-point meeting Parent groups met again to consider a summary of the findings of the literature reviews and early consultations. This included a question about the reasons for differences between what parents consider important to be measured and what professionals most often measure. The main activitywas to examine five questionnaires that had been rated positively in the systematic reviews. Parents were asked to compare and contrast two questionnaires about parent stress, two questionnaires about children 's behaviour problems, and one questionnaire designed as a global measure of outcome. The issues raised were then taken by parent representatives to the MeASURe project Discussion Day on 14 February 2014 (see Chapter 2 ,Consultation with multiple stakeholders).DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk10Results Early meeting Parents expected that professionals would focus on assessment of core features of autism, such as communication and social interaction. However, they suggested that the child 's skills should be acknowledged and more attention be paid to unusual behaviours that the child is exhibiting, as well as measuring what the child is not achieving. For parents, priority areas for measurement included habitbehaviours (such as sleep, diet and food-related behaviours, sensory processing issues, toileting) and also challenging behaviours and 'meltdowns '(such as self-harm, hitting out, anxiety, stress, happiness, tics). Parents endorsed the importance of social communication and social functioning (interacting, playing with others, playing alone, understanding and communicating) and, furthermore, the building blocks of learning, independence and life skills (reading and academic achievements, hobbies and sport, imagination and creativity, self-care, preparing food, getting dressed, time management, vulnerability and danger).They also stated that they recognised that some activities/skills may not seem that important or be seen as relevant for this young age range but become a more significant priority later on in development and as their child progresses through school. Parents also mentioned difficulties they had with taking childrento appointments for health care (vaccination, dental care, shoes, eyes and hearing). These constructsinfluenced the conceptual framework, and the content of the survey for professionals. Parents also commented on aspects of the process of assessment. They recommended the use of video in relaxed environments, so that professionals may watch for changes. They stressed the value of information gathered in a range of settings (suggesting use of video to rate change over time and between different settings). Figure 1 illustrates the themes arising from one of the parent group meetings. Mid-point meetings to undertake the Q-sort There were four groups that completed this task (two in London to accommodate parents' availability). Taking an average of the Q-sort ratings from all sites, the items rated on average as 'more important 'can be grouped as: lBody functions/impairments Hypersensitivity, anxiety, unusual fears, distress, non-verbal ability, expressive and receptive language. lActivity level indicators Aggression, sleep problems, school readiness. lParticipation Happiness, self-esteem, relationships with brothers and sisters, being bullied/rejected, no awareness of danger. lFamilies Parent stress. The highest level of consistency in rating these constructs across groups was for aggression and sleep problems. Parents rated happiness as important for all young children but one group did not agree that this could be considered an ASD-specific measurable outcome. In discussion parents mentioned that theyhad had to learn about autism, and so had not understood at the start of assessments of their child why skills such as 'joint attention 'were of importance. End-point meetings In London it was not possible to arrange an end-point meeting; there were a number of barriers forparents 'travel time ','difficulties getting child care 'and 'need to battle the new school statementing system '. In Exeter, a preliminary meeting was held to discuss with parents how to assess the strengths and weaknesses of tools used in assessment (i.e. explanations of terms such asreliability, validity and sensitivity to change). Within the preliminary report, the ratings on importance by parents were compared with the constructs most often measured by professionals ( Table 2 ), and parents were asked to reflect on the differences.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

DLA, Disability Living Allowance.DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk12The only area of overlap between parents and professionals was 'challenging behaviour '/'fighting, hitting others '. Parents in Newcastle highlighted that they believed that parents tend to focus on broader outcomes than professionals, as they see their children everyday in different environments. Anxieties and distress were emphasised; parents remarked that it is emotional needs that impact on the child 's and family 's quality of life. Parents also believe that professionals tend to be unaware of these important difficulties before a child enters the social environment of education. The Exeter parents had a rather different way of viewing the table. They suggested that professionals measured aspects that were intermediate outcomes, which facilitate what parents rate as important. Forexample, they suggested that parents 'identification of 'fighting, hitting others ','distress ','happiness 'and even 'parent stress 'could be mapped from what the professionals highlighted as 'challenging behaviour '. Similarly, when parents highlighted 'relationships with brothers and sisters' , these benefited from adequate 'speech 'and 'understanding of language '. So, despite the different labels, there was general support from parents for what professionals measure, and parents had noticed their children making progress inthese areas. Consultation with multiple stakeholders Question What outcomes is it important to assess when monitoring the progress and outcomes for children withASD up to the age of 6 years? Methods A Discussion Day was held in London on 14 February 2014. Twenty-five participants were invited: fourparents of children with autism; three young people with autism, two of those with staff who support them in education; eight speech-and-language therapists, occupational therapists, paediatricians or psychologists; and two researchers working with children with autism; six MeASURe project researcherswho work in health or education services also attended. As one activity, groups of similar background carried out a further Q-sort to rate the importance of constructs, and ascertain similarities or differences between what parents, professionals and researchersconsider most important. The set of 21 constructs for the parents and for the young people was drawn primarily from those reported as most often assessed by the early years professionals in the survey. The setTABLE 2 Difference between professionals and parents on their top 10 constructs for measurement of progress or outcome Professionals: areas regularly measured Parents: important areas to measure (rank) 90% social interaction with children Happiness (1) 84% play skills Anxiety, unusual fears (2) 79% attention Positive views of self (self-esteem) (3) 76% amount of speech Distress (4) 75% understanding of language Non-verbal ability (5) 73% expressive communication skills Relationships with brothers and sisters (6) 72% pretend play Parent stress (7) 70% fine motor skills Fighting, hitting others (8) 68% participation in activities Sleep problems (9) 68% challenging behaviour Being rejected by others (10)DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Both sets were completed with added constructs to represent a wide span of subdomains. We hypothesised that: lThe young people and parents might well agree on the top 10 constructs. lThe professionals might also agree with parents, even although what they actually measure is not in accordance. lThe researchers might choose a different set (more based on intervention elements, symptoms and everyday function). lWe had no expectation about parents 'views on the order of importance of what professionals tend to measure. Results Adverse weather conditions and train cancellations prevented several participants joining the DiscussionDay, including two young people on the autism spectrum. However, four groups of four people eachconsidered the constructs. One young adult on the autism spectrum joined the parent group; his/her ranking showed a high level of agreement with the averaged ranking of constructs undertaken previously by parent groups (Spearman rank correlation r s=0.618). Fine motor skills were rated higher than previously because of the experiences of the young adult as a child. 'Friendships 'was rated higher than previously, reflecting on the precursor skills needed by the child early on that will lead later to being able to make friendships. Aspects that affectthe emotional state of the child, including sensory processing, continued to be rated highly. 'Participates in mainstream activities 'was rated low: the group thought 'this means the ASD child has to adapt to the mainstream world rather than 'mainstream 'adapting/understanding/respecting ASD needs '. They also gave a low rating to 'not cooperating, throwing, spitting, won 't sit (challenging behaviour) ', as they considered it the role of adults (parents, education and care staff) to try to make the environment right for the child so his/her autism was less 'disabling '. The two multidisciplinary groups of health and education professionals, and the group of ASD researchers,had low agreement with the averaged ratings of the parent groups ( r s=-0.268, 0.131 and -0.063, respectively). The health and education professionals commented that they measure what they can (in the setting, given the available tools) and what they traditionally have done. They emphasised as 'important ' what they see as most urgent to try to change, such as challenging behaviour and communication skills. In contrast, although acknowledging the importance of the construct 'positive views of self (self-esteem) ', they gave it a lower rating because of the developmental stage of children up to 6 years; researcherssimilarly rated self-esteem as low because of the lack of a suitable measurement tool. The researchers hadrated highest 'not cooperating, throwing, spitting, won 't sit (challenging behaviour)' on the basis of its impact on others and on the child 's experience. Both groups of health and education professionals identified a range of additional constructs that they would consider it important to measure, includingcommunicative competence, problems with food, functional adaptive behaviour, etc. They also mentionedthe importance of identifying the skill set of support staff, and parent confidence in managing their child 's needs and behaviours. When all groups came together, the discussion highlighted differences in perspective, in summary a 'social ' model and a 'medical 'model. The parents and the young adult on the autism spectrum argued that it is important to focus on what children cando, to see autism as a 'difference 'rather than always use a 'deficit 'model, and to focus more on how to enable children through improving their environments. Parents were encouraged that the clinicians had mentioned including assessment of the skills of care and education staff. The clinicians reflected that their approach to assessment and intervention is based on amore 'medical 'model: early identification of specific impairments, treatment, prevention of secondaryDEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk14impairment, and so on. The measurement of outcomes and tools available reflect this framework, with an emphasis on problems and deficits. For the researchers, the model of intervention and outcome assessment was also primarily embedded in a 'deficit 'model of autism, with an emphasis on treating and measuring core features of autism. Research outcomes such as helping parents manage better and understand more are seen as 'soft outcomes' , and not given the same importance as changing children 's characteristics. A certain contradiction was pointed out between the recognition that publicly funded research must now be informed by good patient and public involvement, and yet the priority researchquestions, commissioning briefs and frameworks for judgement of what is good science do not necessarily value the social model of understanding a condition such as ASD. Overall conclusions The MeASURe project took a multifaceted approach to consultation. We aimed to identify (1) whatoutcomes should be measured when monitoring the progress of young children with ASD and (2) whether there is agreement between parents and people with ASD on the one hand, and professionals on theother hand, about the relative importance of what to measure. The initial stages of the review ofqualitative literature, and the early parent advisory groups, added to the conceptual framework developed to guide the project. That framework of four domains and 26 subdomains appears to cover the constructs valued by various stakeholders, and enabled similarities and differences in perspective to be elicited. We found a striking difference between the constructs rated important by parents and the constructs most frequently measured by health and education professionals. In discussion it became clear why this wouldbe likely. Parents 'experience with their children leads them to emphasise emotional well-being as affecting the whole family. Professionals measure what they have the tools for, and acknowledge that their practiceis influenced by an emphasis on the core impairments in autism and the behaviour of the individual child,rather than necessarily seeing the broader picture of how the child is affected by their environment. Thus the consultation has highlighted the need to include information from multiple sources to reflect the complementary perspectives of the different stakeholders. This greater awareness of contrastingperspectives has enriched the discussion of available tools (see Chapter 5 ). Furthermore, parents and young people highlighted critical points about the process of assessment and monitoring of young children with ASD which also contributed to the evidence synthesis.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

The scoping search enabled us to gather information regarding tools that are commonly used to measure outcomes, and to identify theoretically important gaps in thedomains measured. This scoping search was not limited to children up to 6 years of age. Seventy-nine tools were reported in the reviews, including 23 assessing adaptive and maladaptive behaviour; 17, language/communication; 13, ability; eight, sensory; nine, ASD four, impact on family;two, social interaction; one, motor skills; and two, summary scales. Many of the reviews failed to discuss the relevance of the outcome domains, and the strengths and weakness of the included tools -those that did were relatively consistent in their recommendations for improvement. The domain most commonly cited by review authors as missing was 'quality of life' . 39-41 Other missing outcomes included 'school ','independence and daily living skills '39and 'behavioural outcomes 'such as sleep disturbance, self-mutilation, attention and concentration problems.40 Also mentioned was the need for qualitative research to determine which outcomes are 'useful and relevant to consumers, clinicians and service providers '.41 A key limitation mentioned in the reviews concerned ASD-specific tools, developed to aid diagnostic assessment, but used to monitor change, even although not designed and validated for this purpose.40-42 Similarly, intelligence quotient (IQ) has been used as a measure of change although designed to measure a 'stable' construct.43Two further unresolved questions are first how parents (and other stakeholders) define an important change, and, second, what magnitude of change should be considered clinically relevant (and therefore used as the target difference in intervention studies).40-42 Several review teams commented that included studies had measured outcomes using unpublished ornon-standardised measures. 8,43,44Some reviews included studies focusing on anecdotal reports or ad hoc questionnaires created by the researchers for that specific study45and not adequately validated. Finally, one prominent recommendation common to all reviews was the need for a core shared battery of baseline assessment and outcome measurement tools, although the challenge of developing a singlebattery was recognised, because of the heterogeneity of children 's difficulties, developmental ability and trajectory of developmental change. 46Some reviewers proposed specific key domains that they felt should be considered, including intellectual ability, developmental abilities across domains, adaptive behaviour,communication skills, severity of autism, play, social skills, challenging behaviours, rigidity and otherbehaviours that are characteristic of children with autism. 40,47 Review of tools in use The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the range of tools used to date in observational andintervention evaluation studies, and relate these tools to the subdomains of the conceptual framework adopted for the MeASURe project.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Search strategy We included studies published from 1992 to coincide with the publication of the international classifications, International Classification of Diseases , 10th Edition (ICD-10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).48,49 Original searches were conducted in June and July 2012, and re-run in June and July 2013. The databasessearched were: lApplied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ProQuest) 1987 to present lCumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) (EBSCO host) 1981 to present lThe Cochrane Library [includes Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, HTA, Cochrane Central Register of controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Ovid)] inception to present lEducation Resources Information Center (ERIC) (ProQuest) 1966 to present lMEDLINE (including In-Process and Other Non-Indexed citations) (Ovid) 1946 to present lEMBASE (Ovid) 1988 to present lPsycINFO (Ovid) 1987 to present lSociological Abstracts (ProQuest) 1952 to present lLinguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts (ProQuest) 1973 to present lHealth Management Information Consortium (Ovid) 1979 to present lPapersFirst [Online Computer Library Centre (OCLC)] inception to present lProceedings (OCLC) inception to present lScopus, inception to present lSocial Services Abstracts (ProQuest) 1979 to present lWeb of Science (Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities CitationIndex and Conference Proceedings Citation Index inception to present) lWorldCatDissertations (OCLC) inception to present. Additionally, grey literature was searched via Digital Education Resource Archive, Oxford Patient-ReportedOutcomes Measurement database, Turning Research into Practice database, internet searches, and searching of selected websites (see Appendix 3 ). The National Research Register and UK Clinical Research Network were also searched for ongoing research. A master search strategy was created and modified as needed for searching across the breadth of databases; a list of terms can be found in Appendix 3 . Modifications included changes to syntax, fields searched and Medical Subject Heading/thesaurus terms. Full search strategies are available from the first author, andexample search strategies for MEDLINE, ERIC and Web of Science are provided in Appendix 3 .S e a r c h e sw e r e limited to English-language articles only. When possible, search filters were used to limit study types returned. Inclusion criteria We considered inclusion criteria based on types of studies, participants and types of measurement. Types of studies We included: lall relevant randomised and quasi-randomised trials of social, psychological and educational earlyinterventions for children with a diagnosis of ASD lobservational studies of children with ASD (cross-sectional and longitudinal) lcase -control studies lcohort studies, including studies of baby siblings of children with autism, which provide information ontools to monitor developmental progress and follow early markers of ASD.SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF OBSERVATIONAL AND INTERVENTION LITERATURE NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk18Types of participants We reviewed all studies that included at least 50% of children with ASD. Child participants had a 'best-estimate 'clinical diagnosis of an ASD, including autism, ASD, atypical autism, Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder -not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), according to either ICD-10 or DSM-IV48,49criteria. Use of a particular diagnostic tool such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) was not required. Children with ASD andanother medical condition, and children with ASD and comorbid conditions were included. All children were aged 6 years upon entering the study. Types of measurement included lDirect assessment of child ASD symptoms by trained assessor. lDirect assessment of developmental skills, i.e. language, cognition, play skills, fine and gross motor skills, by trained assessor. lObservational coding of social interaction skills. lInterview or self-completed (parent, teacher or other professional) questionnaire report of child ASD symptoms. lInterview or self-completed questionnaire report of developmental skills, i.e. language (vocabulary),adaptive skills, with/by parent, teacher or other professional. lInterview or self-completed (parent, teacher or other professional) questionnaire report of associated problems, including behaviour that challenges, aggression, sleeping, eating, toileting, anxiety, hyperactivity and others identified through parent consultation. lIdiographic measures focused on particular behaviours (e.g. goal attainment scaling, target behaviours). lMeasures of impact on parent or family. Types of measurement not included lEconomic impact on home and family. lExperimental tasks and measures, for example barrier tasks, reaction time. lBiophysical measures, medical investigations. lProcess measures, for example fidelity, adherence, parent satisfaction with intervention.

The decision categories were 'potentially include ', 'exclude ','consider for Chapter 4 '(assesses the measurement properties of a tool only) or 'unclear '. The two reviewers (NL, IPO) cross-checked sets of 20 papers at a time until they reached a high level of agreement. Regular (at least weekly) discussion of decisions was held throughout the process to maintain consistency. Then 3059 papers were examined at full text. When decisions regarding inclusion wereuncertain, a third reviewer (HMcC) made the final decision. There was a further stage of sifting of records found during the search of papers about measurement properties of tools (see Chapter 4 ), with searches completed by 9 September 2013. Those searches revealed 118 records potentially relevant to Chapter 3 . Once duplicates were removed (86), 32 additional records were sifted by full text (completed 8 December 2013): of these, 28 were excluded and fourwere added to the final total for data extraction.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

The data extracted included study eligibility; type of study; participant characteristics; number of outcome tools (then for each tool: name, population for which designed, specific subscales, outcomes measured according to authors). Subsequently, two reviewers with expertise in ASD (JR, HMcC) reviewed each paperfurther and indicated which subdomains in the conceptual framework (see Table 1 ) were measured by each tool, including subscales. Results The data extracted from the 184 papers are presented in Appendix 5 . All of the tools identified in the review as used to measure outcomes are presented in Table 3 . In addition, there were a number of tools developed for use in particular studies; these were described as, for example, 'Caregiver -child interaction ','Coded observation of joint attention ','Examiner ratings of social engagement ','Naturalistic examiner -child play sample ','Parent interview ','Video recording of child in classroom activities ','Sleep diaries 'and so on. Such tools could not be searched for in databases by name (see Chapter 4 ) to examine their measurement properties and so were not considered further (see Appendix 5 ).

Other tools included below, but not considered further, were: ladaptations of tools for use in another language, or tools for which an alternative UK version exists ltools used only in outcome and monitoring studies published before 1995 (given different diagnostic definitions before 1994). Conclusion There were 131 tools to be taken forward, and their names (and acronyms) were used in searches to find papers on their measurement properties (described in Chapter 4 ). It is apparent that, as discussed in the introduction to this chapter, the tools used in research studies to measure outcomes include many which were designed for a different purpose, such as for screening or to enable conclusions to be drawn about an ASD diagnosis in children. However, the review has adopted a pragmatic, inclusive approach to the examination of the identified tools. The planned data extraction in this chapter was to have included information about the reliability, validity and responsiveness to change of tools as described in the intervention evaluation and observational studies. However, when this extraction was piloted, it was found that most studies simply cited thereliability and validity of tools from their source references, irrespective of whether this had been tested with samples of children with ASD. Furthermore, it was not possible to interpret the evidence on responsiveness to change without considering whether the study was adequately powered to detectchange, and whether the choice of outcome tool was appropriate to the nature of the intervention. If a significant intervention effect was not shown, there were a number of possible reasons, and the properties of the tool constituted only one of those reasons. For these reasons, the decision was taken to rely on thesystematic assessment of measurement properties of tools described in Chapter 4 .SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF OBSERVATIONAL AND INTERVENTION LITERATURE NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk26Chapter 4 Systematic review of measurement properties of tools Introduction The searches reported in Chapter 3 revealed the varied range of tools used in the 184 papers from which data were extracted. The next stage of the MeASURe project examined the measurement properties of these tools. As an introduction, we summarise the many different types of tools currently in use, involving face-to-face assessment, observation or report. Types of measurement in use Standardised norm-referenced assessments all have to be administered by a trained professional. Theyhave the advantage of comparison with children of the same age but for several reasons may bemisleading when used for the assessment of young children with ASD. The abilities of the children may be underestimated by lack of co-operation with standardised testing, and they may have profiles that are dissimilar to typical development. Direct observation includes both highly structured observational procedures (such as ADOS) 50and tools used primarily to measure social interaction in naturalistic settings, especially parent- child interaction. The former are a diagnostic assessment tool conducted by a trained assessor with subsequent rating of the child 's behaviours. The latter have the advantage of providing an in-depth understanding of patterns of responsiveness, which may have long-term effects on language and other development.51,52However, one major disadvantage of direct observation is the limited time frame with consequent questions of validity.Further, there are almost as many different coding schedules as studies, depending on the focus of interest. Standardised semistructured interviews have been used in the characterisation of children 's early development and current ASD characteristics (e.g. the ADI-R), 53in the broad measurement of adaptive behaviour [e.g. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS)]54and to gather information on additional difficulties, such as behaviour problems, anxiety and sleep. Problems of measurement include a paucity of tools focused on behaviour, which are specifically validated for ASD (e.g. the Autism Comorbidity Interview-Present and Lifetime Version is one such tool but is validated from only 5 years of age).55 There are very many questionnaires used in studies of children with ASD, completed by parents, teachersand clinicians. However, as with the direct observation and assessment tools, many have not beenspecifically validated for use in ASD and contain assumptions about patterns of typical development (e.g. standard quality-of-life measures do not ask about children 's special skills and circumscribed interests). Search strategies Not all tools identified in Chapter 3 could be searched for by name. There were two main reasons. First, a number of tools had been developed for a particular study (such as a coding procedure for playgroundbehaviour or parent -child interaction, with content related to a particular intervention approach). Second, some tools were translations or adaptations of tools for use in another country, or had been used only up to 1994. Thus papers relating to 131 tools could be searched for by name. Because of its particular relevance to the review, it was decided to add the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile, identified in our consultation with professionals in Chapter 2 as being widely used in nurseries.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

The databases searched were: lERIC (ProQuest): 1966 to present lMEDLINE (Ovid): 1988 (EBSCO host): 1981 to present lPsycINFO (Ovid): 1987 to present. In order to search for papers describing studies of the measurement properties of tools, a search filter developed by the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) group was applied.56The COSMIN filter was originally designed for use in PubMed, and was translated for use in other databases by our information specialist (SR). The translation was tested in Ovid, and discrepancies were discussed with CBT (co-investigator, and part of the team who devised COSMIN). The sensitivity of the revised filters was tested continuously through the early part of data extraction, through inspection of references for 'marker 'papers that should have been included, until the new filters were judged satisfactory. The translation can be found in Appendix 6 . Each search consisted of four components: autism terms, age group terms, COSMIN filter and tool name.A master search strategy was created and modified as needed for searching in various databases -a list of terms can be found in Appendix 6 . Tool names required basic searches in their own right to determine variant spellings, variant names and to include acronyms. For example, numerous tools include the word'scale ', but this might have been reported as 'scales ','scale ','score 'or'scores 'by the authors. Some databases, notably PsycInfo, include a field for tests and measures, and this was utilised if available, as this provides a standard way of identifying a tool regardless of how an author has reported the title. Searches were limited to English-language papers only and papers published from 1992 to present. Measurement tool-only search strategies are available in Appendix 6 . Finally, the searches in Chapter 3 had identified 128 papers which were about measurement properties of tools rather than about monitoring progress or outcomes, and so these were also included in the stage 3sifting (see Figure 3 ). Inclusion criteria 1. Study was published as a 'full text original article '. 2. The tool measured a domain of interest (see 'conceptual framework ',Table 1 ). 3. A tool identified at stage 2 (i.e. used for monitoring and/or to measure outcome in a longitudinal or intervention study with children with ASD up to 6 years old) was the focus of the study. (When a paper reported the measurement properties of a 'new 'relevant tool this was noted but not included.) 4. The study sample overlapped with the age range 0 -6 years (e.g. a sample with age range from 6 to 18 years was judged eligible; one that included 8- to 15-year-olds was ineligible). 5. The study sample included at least 50% of children with ASD. Furthermore, the study sample could be individuals who were being monitored for ASD symptoms even if they had another primary diagnosis (e.g. a paper monitoring ASD symptoms in a Fragile X population could be eligible if exploring measurement properties of a tool used as an outcome). 6. The aim of the study was the development of a measurement tool or the evaluation of one or more of its measurement properties. Note: The property 'Hypothesis testing 'applies in COSMIN to hypothesis testing within a paper about construct validity of a tool (e.g. convergent/divergent validity against othertools; known-groups validity). Studies that tested research hypotheses about change or differences between groups as the result of an intervention, but did not set out to test the measurement properties of the tool, were excluded.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk28Exclusion criteria 1. Papers in which the measurement tool was tested only for its properties in diagnostic assessment or screening and not for monitoring or measuring an outcome. 2. A sample drawn only from the general population of children. 3. Sample size of <20. 4. Studies in which the focus of the paper was not the examination of psychometric properties were not eligible (e.g. if the paper focused only on creating a subtype of ASD, or to group individuals by scores on the tool). 5. With regard to papers on translated tools, if the purpose was simply to validate the translated version then it was not eligible. If the purpose was to explore the tool 's validity in a different culture/country, and the focus was on the properties of the tool, and the findings appear relevant for use in UK then it was included. Four reviewers (MG, JH, NL, IPO) utilised the criteria to sift 10% of articles ( Figure 3 ) independently and to compare results, resulting in tightening of criteria. Sifting was then conducted by a single reviewer, theteam having (at random) divided up assessment of titles and abstracts, selection of full-text articles andconsultation of reference lists of the studies retrieved. In case of uncertainty, the paper was discussed with HMcC before making the decision regarding inclusion. As the COSMIN rating procedure (see below) involves two stages, and the second summary stage involved a different member of the team (includingHMcC) in rating the content of each article, some further exclusions were made, so that the decision-making procedure was very robust. Evaluation of methodological quality The methodological quality of the studies of measurement properties identified was then assessed using the COSMIN checklist.57The checklist has 10 Responsiveness; Interpretability) with standards for how each measurement property should be assessed (see Appendix 7 ). Each item is scored on a four-point rating scale (poor to excellent) and an overall rating for the methodological quality of each study is determined. The full tables are presented inAppendix 8 . At the same time, each reviewer extracted relevant numerical and descriptive information about theproperties addressed (available from the first author). Terwee et al. 57presented criteria for judging the adequacy of each piece of information (Table 4 ). The final step was to combine the ratings of quality of the studies with the ratings of strength of the findings ( Table 5 ) in order to make judgements related to each measurement tool.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Thus the tables and summaries of findings refer to the remaining 57 tools (43%) for which evidence was obtained. The presentation of findings is organised in terms of the subdomains of the conceptual framework for the review (see Table 1 ). For clarity, the first section includes tools that measure symptom severity in ASD, and then global measures of outcome (given extensive overlap between the two). Where the measurement properties of subscales of tools have been evaluated, the tools appear in several separate subdomain tables. In the tables, shaded rows indicate tools for which only poor or negative evidence was obtained. Inseveral cases, the versions of the tools that have been evaluated in the studies have been superseded; the newer versions are referred to in Chapter 5 . The subdomains for which no tool-related evidence was found include Learning; Social relations; Subjective well-being; Social inclusion; Parent -child interaction style; Parenting; and Family quality of life. No tools for physical indicators (tics, gut/bowel symptoms, nutritional status) were included in searches. The gaps inevidence will be discussed further in Chapter 5 . Autism symptom severity For details, see Table 6 . Autism Behavior Checklist The Autism Behavior Checklist (AuBC)58,59was originally constructed as a screening questionnaire completed by parents/carers. It has 57 items grouped into five subscales: Sensory; Relating; Body andobject use; Language; and Social and self-help skills, and provides different profile charts for differentage groups, ranging from 18 months to 35 years. Three papers 60-62considering measurement properties of the AuBC since 1992 were reviewed, of which two60,61had very small samples. Miranda-Linn\u00e9 et al.62 used AuBC with parents of 383 individuals aged 5 -22 years. Using factor analysis, they found a five-factor solution that was inconsistent with the five factors suggested by the originators, explaining 80% of the variance but with good internal consistency of subscales.TABLE 5 Levels of evidence (COSMIN)a Level Rating Criteria Strong +++ or--- Consistent findings in multiple studies of good methodological quality orin one study of excellent methodological quality Moderate ++or-- Consistent findings in multiple studies of fair methodological quality orin one study of good methodological quality Limited +or- One study of fair methodological quality Conflicting +/- Conflicting findings Unknown ?

The 1994 revision had 111 items and the 2003 published version has 93 items. Papers on measurement properties have utilised varying numbers of items; for example, Lecavalier et al.64considered only the algorithm items that are used in determining diagnosis. The ADI-R has good internal consistency, although the Repetitive Behaviours domain consistently shows Cronbach 's alpha coefficient to be <0.7 in the papers examined. Several studies report that inter-rater reliability was monitored and kept at 90% agreement. Studies that formally tested inter-rater reliability reported good levels; for example, Lord et al.65reported kappa statistics of between 0.6 and 0.8 on individual items and 92% agreement on diagnostic cut-off. Extensive work has been done on content validity of the ADI-R as a 'gold standard 'diagnostic tool. One paper66used principal components analysis to derive six clusters, but noted that the inclusion of a few specific items on to particular clusters was unexpected. The evidence concerning structural validity was somewhat contradictory; because of the large numbers of items, few papers included sufficient participants, even for reduced-item sets. The confirmatory factor analyses for two- or three-factor solutions were cut-off for a rating of 'good fit '. Frazier et al.67indicated that factor structures fit equally well for 2- to 6-year-olds as for those aged 7 years. Other than testing level of agreement with ADOS (see Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule , below), only one study64explicitly addressed convergent/divergent validity, finding that the ADI-R Social domain correlated with all VABS ( -0.41 to -0.45) except for motor skills. A strong indication of validity at the level of individual ADI-R items in distinguishing between children with ASD and those without (mostlynon-referred) was provided by Tsuchiya et al. 69Criterion validity was examined in the original Lord et al.63 paper. In addition, Chawarska et al.70examined whether infants referred at age 14 -25 months (and diagnosed 15 months later) could be classified at first assessment; 48% who later received the diagnosis ofautism were classified as such, but 78% if the ADI Repetitive behaviours scale was dropped. As a diagnostic tool, ADI-R might not be expected to be responsive to change; indeed, measurement properties papers 65,71do find general stability in meeting diagnostic cut-off after 6 -8 years in each of the domains. However, Lord et al.65reported that classifications changed substantially more often from ages 2 to 5 years than from ages 5 to 9 years. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G)50is a semistructured, interactive schedule designed to assess aspects of communication, social reciprocal interaction, play, and stereotypedbehaviours and restricted interests. The ADOS-G consists of four modules, appropriate for children andadults of differing language levels, ranging from non-verbal to verbally fluent. The most able, verbally fluent, children may be assessed with module 3; less able children with modules 1 or 2. The social communication algorithm score is reported as the 'total ', as repetitive behaviours may not be observed within a limited-duration play-based assessment. Seven papers 50,65,70,72-75considering measurement properties of the ADOS-G were reviewed. The original study50assessed internal consistency. For the social communication totals, Cronbach' s alpha coefficients were high (0.91 -0.94) for modules 1 -3; however, as the sample size included in each of the unidimensionality analyses was small, the study was judged poor. Three studies50,65,72assessed inter-rater reliability. Two of these studies65,72found kappa statistics to range from 0.60 and 0.80 on all items, and Lord et al.65found 92% agreement for autism/not autism. However, the lack of methodological information regarding these analyses led the study by Kamp-Becker et al.72to be judged as of poor methodological quality. Lord et al.50presented inter-rater kappa statistics for each module separately and found a mean weighted kappa statistic of 0.78 for module 1, 0.70 for module 2 and 0.65 for module 3. For the social-communication algorithm total, test- retest intraclass correlations (ICCs) ranged from 0.84 to 0.98. However, the small sample size for all reliability calculations within modules (ranging from n=23 ton=29) led this paper to be judged as of poor methodological quality.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk34Three papers50,72,73assessed structural validity. Lord et al.50found almost all social and communication items loaded highly on one factor in each module, accounting for between 72% and 78% (modules 1 and 2), and 52% and 53% (modules 3 and 4) of the variance, leading to the adoption of an algorithmtotal of social-communication items. However, the small sample size (79 participants and 29 ratings in module 1, 55 children and 28 ratings in module 2, and 59 participants and 28 ratings in module 3) led this study to be judged to be of poor methodological quality. Kamp-Becker et al. 72assessed structural validity and found in a three-factor solution the amount of variance explained was 47%, in the four-factorsolution it was 52% and the five-factor solution explained 57% of variance. The third paper 73investigated both the original algorithm structure and the new algorithms, compatible with DSM-5. For the youngestgroup ( 6 years) they found RMSEAs of 0.057 and 0.059, respectively, for module 1 (indicating good model fit) and RMSEAs of 0.079 and 0.076, respectively, for module 3 (indicating reasonable model fit). Two studies assessed criterion validity. Grey et al. 74found high agreement between ADOS and a clinical diagnosis of autism [kappa ( and of 209 children aged 20 -55 months (120 with autism or ASD). In a study of infants aged 14- 25 months, Chawarska et al.70 found between 79% and 95% agreement between the ADOS-G module 1 diagnostic classification outcomes and clinician-assigned diagnosis of autism, although agreement with an ASD diagnosis was low.They comment that in this infant sample the ADOS tended to under-diagnose children with higher verbal and non-verbal skills. This tool had three papers 65,70,75assessing 'responsiveness' , or rather testing a hypothesis of stability. The first paper65found that regression prediction of each ADOS domain score at age 9 years, by the set of three domain scores at age 2 years, showed significant continuity within the same domain (with one exception -the communication score at age 9 years -which was predicted by the ADOS Social and Repetitive domains at age 2 years, with no significant independent contribution from communication).Chawarska et al. 70tested stability at 15 months from first assessment and found no significant diagnosis by time interactions. Ben Itzchak and Zachor75also reported stability for 78% of their sample of 68 children, mean age 26 months, in terms of ADOS classification over 1 year; however, the lack of specific hypothesesled this paper to be judged as being of poor methodological quality. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Toddler Module The need for a tool that could assess children for autism at an earlier age led to development of theAutism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Toddler Module (ADOS-T). The development paper 76involved 182 children with best estimate diagnoses of ASD, non-spectrum developmental delay or typical development, aged 12 -30 months. Content validity was good; items were revised, rewritten or removed, as necessary, until all remaining items were deemed relevant. Two algorithms were developed: one for toddlers who were verbal and aged 21 -30 months, and the other for younger, less-able toddlers. Internal consistency was good for the social affect scale for both groupings, and poor for RRBs. Test -retest reliability was not high (ICC =0.6) for RRBs for the verbal toddler algorithm (and n=8), but otherwise good (0.83 -0.94). Inter-rater reliability was high, but the paper was judged to be of poor quality for this property, as the report was for the agreement of seven raters and 14 videos of assessment. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Calibrated Severity Score Refinement of the ADOS algorithm scores led on to the development of the ADOS-Calibrated Severity Score (ADOS-CSS).77The ADOS-CSS potentially allows for greater understanding of the manifestation of core autism symptom severity over time, independently of factors such as age, IQ and language level. Gotham et al.77tested the hypothesis that severity scores would be less related to factors such as IQ than the raw scores, and this was found. Two studies78,79have examined the ADOS-CSS in independent samples, with somewhat mixed findings. De Bildt et al.78found in a large clinical Dutch sample that CSS discriminated the autism, non-autism ASD and non-spectrum classifications well, and were more comparable over various developmental groupings than the raw scores on the ADOS, especially in module 1 and somewhat less so in module 3. For module 2, the larger proportion of children with non-autism ASDDOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Shumway et al.79examined whether or not calibrated severity scores were independent of other factors. They found that a regression model accounted for 56% of the variance in ADOS raw score, but for only 18% of the variance in calibratedseverity score, i.e. independent of verbal and non-verbal developmental quotient. In addition, they found good stability of scoring after an interval of 12 -24 months. Autism Observation Scale for Infants The Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI)80was developed to detect and monitor early signs of autism as they emerge in high-risk infants. It is an 18-item direct observational measure designed to detect and monitor putative signs of autism in infants aged 6 -18 months. Data on inter-rater reliability was good, test -retest reliability less so, but the sample size was only 2081and thus judged to be of poor methodological quality. Georgiades et al.82found good discrimination between high- and low-risk infants (i.e. infant siblings of children with ASD vs. no ASD). Baby and Infant Screen for Children with aUtIsm Traits-Part 1 The Baby and Infant Screen for Children with aUtIsm Traits-Part 1 (BISCUIT-Part 183) is designed to assess symptoms of ASD in children between the ages of 17 and 37 months. It comprises 62 items scored on athree-point, Likert-type scale. Parents are asked to rate the child on each item, comparing them to a typically developing child as '0'(not different; no impairment), '1'(somewhat different; mild impairment) or'2'(very different; severe impairment). For the factor analysis study, 84405 infants with a diagnosis of ASD were selected from a total of 1287 enrolled in a US state-funded early intervention programme forchildren at risk for a developmental disability. In factor analysis, a three-factor structure (socialisation, repetitive behaviour, communication) accounted for only 33% of the variance (with seven items that didnot load on to any factor) but the internal consistency of the factors was good [alpha ( )=0.93, 0.90, 0.87, respectively]. Factor scores were significantly higher than for infants without ASD. Matson et al. 85 demonstrated convergent validity of the BISCUIT-Part 1 with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers(M-CHAT) and the Personal -Social domain of the Battelle Developmental Inventory-Second Edition, and divergent validity with the Battelle Adaptive and Motor domains. Behavioral Summarized Evaluation and Behavioral Summarized Evaluation-Revised The Behavioral Summarized Evaluation (BSE)86is a 20-item instrument that examines the scope and severity of behaviour problems in autistic children. Items are rated by a clinician on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (continuously). A global score can be obtained by summing the 20-item scores. A revised version later added nine items.87Four papers considering measurement properties of the BSE were reviewed. One study88assessed internal consistency and found that Cronbach 's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.83 to 0.90. However, the small sample size included in the unidimensionality analysis led this studyto be judged as methodologically poor (20 items, 53 participants). Two studies assessed inter-rater reliability 86,87and found ICCs for the global score to range from 0.96 to 0.97. However, the small sample size ( n=29) led one of these studies87to be judged as having poor methodological quality. The content validity was good, having been developed over several iterations in practice, with correlation of the globalscore or first factor with IQ and not with age. 86,87Four studies86-88,89assessed structural validity; however, the small sample size of two studies86,88led them both to be judged as having poor methodological quality. Construct validity in the remaining studies was not strong overall; two main factors were found together accounting for almost 50% of the variance,86-88with the first factor, labelled 'autism 'or 'interaction disorder ', relatively consistent, but the second factor very variable. Roux et al.89further examined the structure of the first factor and found it to account for 61% of the variance. One study88 assessed convergent validity, and found correlations between this tool and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) to all be >0.77. One study assessed known-groups validity87and found all relevant hypotheses supported. This same study assessed criterion validity87and found partial correlations between this tool and an expert clinical rating to range from 0.24 to 0.63 but the quality of the evidence wasjudged to be poor.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk36Infant Behavioral Summarized Evaluation The Infant Behavioral Summarized Evaluation (IBSE) is an observational rating scale adapted from the BSE for the assessment of behaviours of young children having autistic disorders. The original paper90 describing the development and measurement properties of the IBSE was reviewed. Eighty-nine children aged 6 -48 months, referred for clinical assessment, were included. The study assessed inter-rater reliability of the initial 33 items and found an ICC of 0.97. The same study assessed the tool 's structural validity: 59.4% of total variance was explained by a two-factor solution, with 19 items constituting the first factor labelled 'autism '. However, the small sample size (89 participants and 31 reliable items) led this paper to be judged as having poor methodological quality. Childhood Autism Rating Scale The CARS91,92is a behavioural rating scale that is widely used in the diagnosis of children with autism and pervasive developmental disorders. The CARS is a 15-item observation and parent interview measure thatquantifies the severity of behaviours associated with autism. Items are rated on a scale from 1 ('normal ') to 4 ( 'severely abnormal '). Total scores 30 strongly suggest the presence of autism. In a range of small studies (see Appendix 8 ), internal consistency of the total score was found to be good, as it was in one large study in India. 93However, Magyar et al.94conducted principal components analysis, finding four factors with only one alpha coefficient of >0.70: social communication (0.78), social interaction (0.61), stereotypies and sensory abnormalities (0.54), and emotional regulation (0.59). At the item level, averageinter-rater reliability was r=0.71, range for the items 0.55 -0.93 (only one was >0.80). 91However, for the total score, inter-rater reliability was reported to be good: ICC =0.74;93ICC=0.73.95Test -retest reliability after 1 year, in children referred for ASD assessment, was high (ICC =0.81).93A number of different factor solutions have been proposed. Stella et al.96reported five factors accounting for 64% of the variance: emotional reactivity, social communication, social orienting, odd sensory exploration, and cognitive and behavioural consistency. The four-factor structure reported by Magyar et al.94accounted for only 41% of the variance. Stella et al.96examined convergent and divergent validity of the factor scores in relation to the VABS but did not find the hypothesised pattern of correlations. Gilliam Autism Rating Scale and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition The Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS) is a behavioural checklist developed for use by parents, teachers and professionals to discriminate individuals who are autistic from those with other developmental disabilities. It is intended for use with individuals aged from 3 to 22 years. The GARS has 56 items, divided into four scales; Social interaction, Communication, and Stereotyped behaviours are rated on a four-pointscale of frequency, and Developmental disturbances rates early milestones on a dichotomous scale. The summary score is the Autism Quotient. South et al. 97raised concerns about the capacity of the scale to detect autism in a sample of 119 children aged 3 -10 years with strictly defined autism, finding that the mean Autism Quotient was significantly lower than the reference of 100. Lecavalier98raised similar concerns with a broader sample aged 3 -21 years. Furthermore the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the first three scales accounted for only 37% of the variance. Internal consistency of those three scales was good; the Developmental disturbances scale was lower, with Cronbach 's=0.68. However, parent -teacher inter-rater reliability was low =0.40). Pandolfi et al.99examined the GARS-Second Edition (GARS-2), a revision and normative update,100which has very similar content in the main three scales. The EFA accounted for 34.1% of the variance and the factor model was not entirelyconsistent with the conceptually derived organisation of the GARS-2. A four-factor model was preferred, for which scale reliability estimates were good. Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers The M-CHAT was designed as a screening tool with 23 'yes/no 'items that can be given to parents by clinicians, with a focus on 18 -24 months of age. It does not rely on the professional 's observation of the child, but on parents 'report of current skills and behaviours. In the original study,101internal consistency for the whole scale ( =0.85) and for six critical items found on discriminant function analysis ( =0.83) was good. Snow et al.102reported internal consistencies of 0.80 and 0.74, respectively, in a sample of clinically referred 18- to 48-month-old children. However, both papers were judged to be of poor qualityDOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.37for this property, as the unidimensionality of the scale was not checked. Snow et al.102used the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) to assess criterion validity and found a correlation of 0.77. Inada et al.103tested inter-rater reliability (mother -father pairs, r=0.93) and test -retest reliability ( r=0.99) after a mean of 8 days in a Japanese translation; however, the paper had a small sample and so was judged to be poor. Parent Observation of Early Markers Scale The Parent Observation of Early Markers Scale (POEMS) is a new parent report instrument to monitorprospectively the behavioural development of infants at risk for ASD. 104The target age is 1 -24 months, and the development study involved 108 infants. POEMS includes 61 items that are rated on a four-point scale. Internal consistency was good at each of six age groupings. Test -retest reliability over a 1-month period was checked at 11 different age groupings and was high (with one exception); however, theevidence is of poor quality given small sample sizes. Convergent and divergent validity were established forthe POEMS through correlations with domains of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. 105Relationships with the ASQ were stronger with the core features of ASD (social and communication problems) thanwith gross motor problems; however, the correlations with social and communication domains were only-0.41 and -0.45, respectively. Pervasive Developmental Disorders Rating Scale The Pervasive Developmental Disorders Rating Scale (PDDRS)106is a rating scale designed to assist in the screening and diagnostic process for autistic disorder. It contains 51 items, which comprise three subscales: Arousal, Affect and Cognition. Items are rated by a parent (or teacher who has known the individual for at least 2 months) on a five-point Likert scale according to the degree of severity of the behaviour described.Two papers were evaluated. 42,107Williams and Eaves107reported on 456 participants with a diagnosis of ASD ranging in age from 1 to 12 years (as well as 111 adolescents and young adults). Ratings by the sameteacher at a mean interval of 9.5 months, with 62.5% of the ratings having a 6-month time gap, were used to assess test -retest reliability; reliability coefficients ranged from 0.86 to 0.92 for subscales, and 0.92 for the total score. Internal consistency was also good, with subscale Cronbach 's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.75 to 0.86, and total score of 0.89. The second paper 42considered teacher ratings of 168 children aged 1 -12 years. EFA found three factors, accounting for 64% of the variance, with internal consistency at least 0.80; however, because of the low sample size in relation to number of items, the evidence was judged to be poor. Real Life Rating Scale The Real Life Rating Scale (RLRS)108is a behavioural rating scale used in the diagnosis of autism; in comparison with other such scales it is noted to place emphasis on disturbances in response to sensory stimuli. The 47 items of the RLRS are completed by trained assessors, for example in Sturmey et al. ,61based on clinical assessment observations of children during a 30-minute free play period. Sturmey et al.61 examined internal consistency; this was good for the total score ( =0.84) but poor for the subscales, ranging from 0.42 to 0.68. However, the sample was small -34 children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ASD -and so the evidence was judged to be poor. Similarly, Sevin et al.109reported on inter-rater reliability for a small sample of 24 children and adolescents. Reliability was poor for the 40 items observed,with mean agreement-level kappa =0.31, and the highest-item kappa =0.64 (disturbs others). Social Communication Questionnaire The SCQ (originally called the Autism Screening Questionnaire)110is a 40-item questionnaire based on the ADI-R,63which enquires about characteristic autistic behaviours. Parents are asked to indicate whether or not their child shows a particular symptom (current), and whether they did so at age 4 -5 years (lifetime). Language items not suitable for non-verbal children can be omitted. Scores are out of a total of 39 or 32,depending on a child 's language level, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The factor-based and total scores evidenced good-to-excellent scale reliability using confirmatory factoranalysis parameters (factor loadings and error variances) in children with Down syndrome. 111SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk38Snow et al.102also found good internal consistency for total score ( =0.81); however, for the domain scores internal consistency was not good (Reciprocal Social Interaction domain 0.70; Communication 0.47; and Restricted, Repetitive, and Stereotyped Patterns of Behaviour 0.76). Magyar et al.111conducted EFA, which suggested a two-factor solution accounting for 54.4% of the variance: social communication, and stereotyped behaviour and unusual interests. Some evidence of criterion validity was found; for example, Magyar et al.111showed agreement of the two factor scores with corresponding domains in the ADI-R. Charman et al.,112in a longitudinal study, aimed to compare the utility of three scales to measure developmental change in children 's profiles over time. On the SCQ (current behaviour) there was no change in 57 children with ASD (aged <6 years at the start), whereas on the VABS-Screener version (VABS-Screener) the children gained 9 months equivalent in 11 months on the Socialisation scale, and gained 10 months on the Communication scale. Therefore, evidence suggests that the SCQ does not detect change in measurement of autism characteristics when reduction in severity might havebeen expected. Social Responsiveness Scale The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)113,114is a 65-item questionnaire which takes 15 -20 minutes to complete by parents, teachers or other adults who routinely observe the child in a naturalistic social setting. The item content of the two versions (36 -48 months and 4 -18 years) differs only on the basis of developmental appropriateness of the wording for rating the behaviours of children in the respective age groups, therefore they are considered together. Factor analyses support a one-factor solution; for example, principal components analysis revealed a primary factor explaining >30% of the variance, with five factors accounting for 49% of the variance in total.114Good internal consistency115,116has been found for the total score. However, because of poor goodness of fit (e.g. differing relevance of itemsacross ages), Duku et al. 116have since explored a 30-item version that correlates strongly with the 65-item scale ( r=0.94). For reliability, findings were mixed. For the 36-48 months version, Pine et al.117reported reasonable maternal SRS test -retest reliability ( r=0.74) measured at variable intervals (6, 24 and 42 weeks) in a mixed sample; however, Bolte et al.115reported r=0.97 in an older clinical sample, including children with ASD. Agreement between parents and teachers was found to be reasonable: r=0.78;118ICC=0.66,117 whereas mother- father agreement in an older clinical sample was reported to be high115(0.97). Good convergent and divergent validity have been shown, for example, with the Child Behavior Checklist(CBCL), 115,116and Bolte et al.115also showed good discrimination between groups at a total and at item level. For criterion validity, correlations even with the SCQ are moderate ( r=0.58) and lower with domains of the ADI-R (e.g. r=0.46 with the Social domain). Global measure of outcome For details, see Table 7 . Autism Treatment and Evaluation Checklist The Autism Treatment and Evaluation Checklist (ATEC)119is a 77-item, one-page checklist designed to be completed by parents, teachers and/or primary caretakers of children with ASD and to measure response to treatment. Three papers considering measurement properties of the ATEC were reviewed. One study120 assessed internal consistency and found Cronbach 's alpha coefficients for the four subscales to range from 0.86 to 0.96. Owing to the small sample size (n =22), this paper was judged to be of poor methodological quality. Two studies120,121assessed convergent validity and found correlations between the ATEC and the British Picture Vocabulary Scale-II to range from -0.53 to -0.63, correlations with the Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test to range from -0.60 to -0.67, correlation with the VABS composite to range from -0.79 to -0.88, correlations with ADI-R total raw score to range from 0.82 to 0.88,120and correlation with the CARS of 0.71.121Two studies112,120assessed responsiveness. Charman et al.112found 50% of their hypotheses regarding change scores to be supported, whereas clear evidence of change was found for allsubscales of the VABS-Screener (see Table 11 , below). Magiati et al. 120also found that 50% of ATEC scalesDOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

However, there were large individual differences in ATEC score changes over time. Pervasive Developmental Disorders Behavior Inventory The Pervasive Developmental Disorders Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) is an informant-based questionnaire that is designed to assess responsiveness to intervention in children diagnosed with ASD. The PDDBIitems are organised into six maladaptive and four adaptive scales, with parent (176 items) and teacher (144 items) versions. The subscales independently address different types of behaviours, so that each subscale can be used separately or as part of the entire inventory. This is to enable researchers to assess, more frequently, behaviours that may change over the short term (e.g. stereotypies or aggressiveness), but, lessfrequently, other behaviours that would be expected to change over a longer time span (e.g. non-verbal prosocial skills or expressive language skills). The PDDBI development paper 122described a comprehensive establishment of content validity from an initial large item pool and field testing. The authors then reported questionnaires completed by 311 parents of children with ASD between the ages of 1 and 17 years (mode 5 years). Alpha coefficients ranged from 0.79 to 0.97 in the parent version, and from 0.73 to 0.97 in the teacher version. Inter-rater reliability (between teachers, and between teachers and parents) was good forthe verbally mediated subscales: Learning, Memory, and Receptive language; Phonological skills; andSemantic/pragmatic ability. Differences in agreement were most obvious for the Sensory/perceptual approach behaviours, Aggressiveness, and Social approach behaviours subscales. Principal components analysis of all subscales resulted in two factors together accounting for 65% of the variance. Separatefactor analyses within subscales mostly found the predicted factor structure. Cohen 123found significant correlations with the ADI-R subdomain Current behaviour scores, but all were <0.60. Social awareness For details, see Table 8 . Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales-Developmental Profile-Behavior Sample The Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales-Developmental Profile (CSBS-DP)124,125is a standardised tool for the assessment of communication and symbolic abilities of children in their second year of life. It consists of three measures: 24-item Infant -Toddler Checklist; Caregiver Questionnaire; and Behavior Sample, which is a face-to-face evaluation of the interaction between a child and parent, and clinician. Those three measures aim to assess a range of social, speech and symbolic skills. The one paper identified in stage 3126investigated the inter-rater reliability of the CSBS-DP-Behavior Sample, and reported gcoefficients ranging from 0.92 to 0.97 for the composites and total score. However, a small sample was used (20% of the data) so the evidence is judged to be poor. Early Social Communication Scales The Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS)127,128measures non-verbal social communication, through rating by a trained investigator of directly observed skills in social interaction, joint attention and behaviourregulation, in children up to 30 months of age. The live scoring [Early Social Communication Scales Live(ESCS-L)] is an abbreviated version of the original ESCS coding scheme. 128Inter-rater reliability was calculated in the one paper reviewed129and the average percentage agreement was 88.3; however, only a proportion of the sample was used in this analysis so the evidence was judged to be poor. Imitation Battery The Imitation Battery (IB)130examines imitation skills in children, including those diagnosed with ASD. Luyster et al.129presented a nine-item battery of manual actions, oral-facial actions and actions on objects to 164 toddlers with ASD, aged 18- 34 months. Inter-rater reliability of the IB was reported as 97.2% agreement but the sample size (10%) was small.

Imitation Disorders Evaluation scale The Imitation Disorders Evaluation (IDE) scale132is a nine-item clinical scale evaluating atypical imitation in infants and young children with autism. Items are rated by a trained observer on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (behaviour never observed) to 4 (behaviour always observed). In the Malvy et al.132 development paper, insufficient information is given on both inter-rater reliability (kappa statistics ranging between 0.4 and 1) and structural validity (72.9% of the total variance accounted for) to draw conclusions about the IDE scale measurement properties. Motor Imitation Scale The Motor Imitation Scale133was developed as a structured imitation assessment for children with ASD. It includes 16 tasks, split equally between object and body imitation tasks, half of those involving meaningful and half non-meaningful actions. Items are rated by a trained investigator on a three-point scale, with a '0'score when there is no imitation, '1'for an emerging response and '2'for exact imitation. Ingersoll and Meyer134investigated the relationship between imitation and other social-communication skills in 27 children with autism, average age 38.7 months. After controlling for developmental level, the total imitation score was found to be significantly and positively correlated with expressive vocabulary (r =0.36); however, the sample size used in the study was small so the evidence was judged poor. Preschool Imitation and Praxis Scale The Preschool Imitation and Praxis Scale (PIPS)135is a 30-item observational scale with 10 task categories (six gestural, three procedural and one facial) assessing imitation performance in young children. In thedevelopment paper, Vanvuchelen et al. 135reported good overall internal consistency (Cronbach 's=0.97) and a four-factor structure explaining 66.6% of the variance. Also they found positive and strong associations (amid r=0.59 and 0.74) between the PIPS score and scores on language and motor measures in children with ASD. The second paper reviewed on the measurement properties of the PIPS136demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability for the scale (ICC =0.986) and investigated the smallest detectable difference for the scale. Social Communication Assessment for Toddlers with Autism The Social Communication Assessment for Toddlers with Autism (SCATA)137is a semistructured observational tool eliciting social communication behaviours in young children with ASD with an unfamiliaradult. Four dimensions of communicative act are scored: form, function, communicative role and complexity. Reliability was found to be excellent for the total number of communication acts (ICC =0.93). Frequency of communication over time was stable in the study, with greater communication difficulties shown by children with more severe diagnosis. The early social communication scores were also associated with later language scores. However, the paper is judged to be of poor quality because of the small sample. Restricted and repetitive behaviour and interests For details, see Table 9. Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised A total of 20 eligible papers assessed the ADI-R Restricted and Repetitive Behaviours and Interests domain. Internal consistency was assessed in five papers;63,64,68,138,139none reached the COSMIN cut-off for internal consistency (Cronbach 's>0.70) with the exception of the Snow et al.68paper, for which Cronbach 's alpha coefficient was 0.70 for verbal children but not non-verbal children (0.61). Test -retest reliability was assessed in two papers63,140but both were of poor quality. Inter-rater reliability was acceptable in three papers.65,67,69In all three papers65,67,69the raters were trained and monitored to maintain quality and consistency of ratings. Lord et al.63and Moss et al.71also assessed inter-rater reliability but the studies were of poor methodological quality due to small sample size.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

By inspection of the face validity of constructs generated by factor analysis, Tadevosyan-Leyfer et al.66demonstrated that the ADI-R had good content validity. Thirteen papers,63,67,68,74,138,141-148of varying quality, assessed structural validity of the Restricted and Repetitive Behaviours and Interests domain with conflicting results. Four papers68,138,141,142provided results that supported the structural validity of the Restricted and Repetitive Behaviours and Interests domain of theADI-R. Generally, a two-factor structure was found to be the best fit, with the factors labelled 'insistence on sameness 'and 'repetitive sensory and motor behaviour '. Three papers of good quality did not provide enough information to assess structural validity. 143-145However, three good-quality papers67,146,147and one paper,148judged as being of excellent quality, did not support the structural validity of the ADI-R Restricted and Repetitive Behaviours and Interests domain. In Frazier et al.67none of the factor solutions produced acceptable model fit, as RMSEA did not reach the <0.06 cut-off or the Tucker fit index >0.95 cut-off. et al.146reported a three-factor accounting 38% of the variance. Similarly, Szatmari et al.147reported that a two-factor solution accounted for just 36% of the variance. Finally, the excellent quality paper148reported a two-factor solution accounting for 43% of the variance. Convergent and/or divergent validity was supported in all eight relevant papers. Both Lord et al.63and Grey et al.74 showed that ASD and non-ASD groups differed significantly on RRB scores. Responsiveness (in effect, stability) of the ADI-R was supported in two papers,65,71both of fair methodological quality. In the Moss et al.71study, there was no statistically significant change in the number of participants (n=35, average age 3.5 years) meeting autism criteria on the ADI-R at follow-up after 7 years. Lord et al.65 also demonstrated that ADI-R 'ever '/lifetime scores for restricted and repetitive behaviours and interests (RRBI) were higher at the age of 9 years than at 2 years, as expected, and that mean 'current 'scores showed a marked reduction. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic Seven papers assessed one or more measurement properties of the ADOS-G in relation to RRBI. Lord et al.50 assessed internal consistency, test -retest reliability and structural validity of modules 1 -3; however, the methodological quality was poor for all assessments due to small sample sizes for each module. Inter-rater reliability did not reach the COSMIN criterion in Lord et al.65for modules 1 and 2. Support for structural validity was excellent for module 1 but not for module 3, as none of the proposedmodels produced model fit statistics that satisfied the COSMIN criteria. 73Kamp-Becker et al.72assessed the structural validity of ADOS modules 3 and 4 together, and showed that a four- and five-factor solution explained 52% and 57% of the variance, respectively. In the five-factor solution, factor 4 'stereotyped behaviour 'and factor 5 'interests and compulsions 'were relevant to the Repetitive and Restricted Behaviour domain of functioning. Criterion validity was supported by Chawarska et al.70for module 1, with 91% of cases matching clinician-assigned diagnosis of autism. Grey et al.74provided good support for criterion validity in both modules 1 and 2 with high agreement between ADOS and clinical diagnosis ( =0.70; p<0.001) and significant differences between ASD and non-ASD groups in the Repetitive and Restricted Behaviour domain. Finally, three papers,65,70,149all judged as of fair methodological quality, supported the responsiveness of ADOS-G. Scores in the Stereotypic Behaviours domain were shown to be stable, as expected, over a period of 15 months.70The ADOS-G was able to measure improvement in functioning over time in Ben Itzchak et al.149and change scores for ADOS-G and ADI-R gave similar findings in Lord et al.65 Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Toddler Module The development paper76for the ADOS-Toddler Module reported poor internal consistency for the Repetitive and Restricted Behaviours domain (Cronbach 's=0.50). Test- retest reliability was moderate (ICC=0.6) for RRBs for the verbal toddler algorithm but otherwise good. Inter-rater reliability was high,DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Luyster et al.76also reported that numerous drafts and pilot analyses for content validity were conducted, and items removed and added as appropriate. Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised150is a 43-item questionnaire designed to assess problem behaviour and was revised from the original RBS to tap into some of the complex RRBs observed in people with autism. The questionnaire is completed by parents/caregivers. The items have been conceptually grouped into six subscales: (1) Stereotyped behaviour; (2) Self-injurious behaviour; (3) Compulsive behaviour; (4) Ritualistic behaviour; (5) Sameness behaviour (insisting that things stay the same); and (6) Restrictedbehaviour/interests. Both Lam et al. 151and Mirenda et al.152provided evidence of good internal consistency for the overall score and for all subscales. Lam et al. 's151assessment of test -retest reliability was judged to be poor because of a small sample size. Structural validity was not supported, although in both cases statistical tests fell just below the COSMIN cut-offs. In Lam et al.,15147.5% of the variance was explained by a four-factor solution. Five- and six factor solutions provided a good fit to the data in Mirenda et al.,152with RMSEA validity was supported by both Mirenda et al.152and Lam et al.151 Sensory processing For details, see Table 10. Sense and Self-Regulation Checklist The Sense and Self-Regulation Checklist (SSC)153is a 65-item caregiver questionnaire of children 's sensory and self-regulatory difficulties, rated on a four-point Likert-type scale, ranging from '0'(never) to '3' (often). It sensory one paper 153considering measurement properties of the SSC was reviewed and used the SSC data from 265 children (including 99 children with ASD) aged <6 years. The study153reports good internal consistency ( =0.87 for total) and acceptable test -retest reliability at 4 months interval ( r=0.68) and shows strong relationships between sensory and self-regulation impairment and severity of autism(however, only a subsample of 38 parents was used in the reliability study). The study showed predicteddifferences between children with ASD, and developmentally delayed and typically developing children, on the SSC. Sensory Profile The Sensory Profile (SP)154is a caregiver questionnaire that measures a child 's sensory processing abilities. The questionnaire consists of 125 items, rated on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from almost never to almost always. The measure is divided into three main sections -Sensory Processing, Modulation, and Behavioural and Emotional Responses -and 14 sensory-processing categories. Children can also be classified as fitting into one of the four general sensory processing 'quadrants ': sensation seeking, sensation avoiding, sensory sensitivity and low registration. The SP can be used with 3- to 10-year-olds. The reviewed paper155 reported good known-groups validity of the SP between children with autism and typically developing children in the Australian sample. Short Sensory Profile The Short Sensory Profile (SSP)154is a 38-item, five-point Likert scale caregiver questionnaire intended to assess sensory processing and sensory systems. The questionnaire consists of seven factors: tactileSYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk46TABLE 10 Summary of quality: sensory processing consistencyReliability ContentvalidityStructuralvalidityHypothesis Self-Regulation Checklist (1)? - ++ Sensory Profile (1) + Short Sensory Profile (2) ? ++ + +++ or--- , strong evidence; ++or--, moderate unknown, owing poor methodological quality; blank cell, no evidence available.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Two papers156,157looked at measurement properties of the SSP; however, in one of them,156an adapted version of the SSP was used, with 10 additional items from the SP,154 and seven additional items from the researchers 'clinical experience. In that study,156the information provided is not sufficient to determine the rating for internal consis tency; however, it is reported that the SSP successfully classified 80.9% of the cases correctly among typically developing, learning-disabled children and those with autism. Wiggins et al.157found support for hypotheses that children with ASD show more sensory abnormalities than children diagnosed with developmental delays, and that sensory abnormalities are associated with stereotyped interests and behaviours as measured by ADOS. Language For details, see Table 11. Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language The Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (CASL)158is a direct assessment of oral language skills in four areas: lexical/semantic, syntactic, supralinguistic and pragmatic. The subtests in the CASL can be either be administered individually or a total score can be obtained. In the Reichow et al. study,159 six specific CASL subtests were examined: Nonliteral Language, Pragmatic Judgment, Antonyms, Syntax Construction, Paragraph Comprehension and Inference. The study159showed significant correlations between the Pragmatic Judgment and Inferences CASL and the VABS Communication andSocialisation domains respectively), suggesting that those two CASL subscales are not acceptable measures of language skills in individuals with ASD, as the correlation values were below COSMIN cut-offs. MacArthur -Bates Communicative Development Inventories The MacArthur -Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MCDI)160,161is a parent report of children' s early language skills. It consists of two forms: 'Words and Gestures (Infant) 'and 'Words and Sentences '. The former is an assessment of vocabulary comprehension, vocabulary production and use of gestures in infants between 8 and 16 months. The latter measures vocabulary production, sentence complexity, grammatical development and the mean length of the child' s three longest utterances, in children between 16 and 30 months of age. Bruckner et al.162performed differential item functioning analysis and reported items that weakened the validity of the MCDI-Infant when scores of typically developinginfants were compared with those with ASD. Luyster et al. 129investigated associations between different measures of early language in toddlers with ASD, including both forms of MCDI. They reported high correlations between the MCDI, Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and VABS (correlations between the MCDI and VABS r=0.77; between r=0.82, and VABS r=0.88). Mullen Scales of Early Learning The MSEL163is a developmental test for young children aged 0 -69 months assessing visual reception, receptive language, expressive language and fine motor skills. One study164investigated the measurement properties of the MSEL. Burns et al.164found support for the hypotheses that children with developmental delays would present significantly more difficulties regarding expressive and receptive language skills than typically developing children matched for age, race and gender. Also the authors found that childrenwith ASD were more likely to exhibit impairment in receptive language skills than children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Preschool Language Scale-Fourth Edition The Preschool Language Scale-Fourth Edition (PLS-4)165is an assessment of language skills identifying children with language disability. It can be used with children up to 7 years of age and provides a total language score, auditory comprehension and expressive communication scores.

The authors166reported a small correlation with ADOS scores ( r=-0.12) and a strong correlation with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition (Vineland-II) Communication domain ( r=0.75). Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales The VABS167consist of a semistructured interview administered to the parent/carer or an adult with detailed knowledge of the functioning of the child. The ratings assess adaptive behaviour in four main domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialisation, and Motor skills (the last domain, however, is measured only for children of <6 years of age). Also, the VABS includes a Maladaptive Behavior Scale. All of the items are rated on a three-point Likert scale, ranging from '0'(seldom or never present) to '2' (always present). One study168showed that 20 children with ASD (average age 47.4 months) made significant developmental progress in the Communication Skills domain of the VABS, from baseline toyear 1 and year 2; however, the small sample means that the evidence was judged to be poor. Paul et al. 169 investigated differences between 20 children with autism and 20 diagnosed with PDD-NOS, aged 4 -11 years. The authors found that group differences were observed only in very specific areas, but their hypothesis wassupported with regard to use of expressive language. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Classroom version The VABS-Classroom version (VABS-Classroom) is a 244-item questionnaire that aims to assess adaptivebehaviours in a classroom environment and is usually completed by teachers. Wells et al. 170investigated the relationship between autism severity and adaptive behaviour, including communication skills. Theyreported correlations between autism severity (measured by CARS) and VABS-Classroom receptivelanguage ( r=-0.27, not significant) and expressive Adaptive Behavior Scales-Screener version The VABS-Screener version (VABS-Screener)171is an adaptation of the VABS, with 45 items rated from '0' (when a child does not demonstrate behaviours) to '2'(when a child usually demonstrates a behaviour). Charman et al.112examined developmental change in children 's profiles over 11 months. The sample of 40 children gained 10 age-equivalent months in communication skills. Also paired t-tests indicated that age equivalents at time 2 were significantly higher than at time 1 for communication skills. Cognitive ability For details, see Table 12. Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised The Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised (Leiter-R)172was designed to assess non-verbal cognitive ability in people with a variety of language complications. It is divided into two test batteries that include 10 subscales each. The Visualisation and Reasoning battery is used to obtain a composite IQ. The Attention and Memory subscales are used to evaluate deficits in Attention or Memory domains. Three papers173 -175 considering measurement properties of the Leiter-R were reviewed. The tool 's convergent validity was assessed by two studies.173,174The first173found the Leiter-R to be moderately correlated with the Brief Intelligence to 0.97) between the original Leiter International Performance Scale and Leiter-R IQ scores. However,the small sample size of this study ( n=26) led this paper to be judged as having poor methodological quality. One study 175assessed the tool' s known-groups validity, and found that only two of the study 's four hypotheses were supported. The tool 's criterion validity was assessed by Grondhuis and Mulick,175 who found the Leiter-R to be moderately correlated (ICC =0.66) with the non-verbal Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales-Fifth Edition (SB5).SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk50TABLE 12 Summary of quality: cognitive ability PerformanceScale-Revised (3)+ Mullen Scales of Early Learning (2) -- ++ Mullen Scales of Early Learning-EarlyLearning Composite (1)++ Stanford -Binet unknown, owing poor methodological quality; blank cell, no evidence available.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Two papers164,176 considering measurement properties of the MSEL when used with children with ASD were reviewed. Burns et al.164assessed known-groups validity (their sample included 19 children with ASD) and found support for only one of the study 's two hypotheses. Bishop et al.,176in a sample of 59 children with ASD, assessed criterion validity and found correlations between the Differential Ability Scales and the MSEL Non-verbal IQ scores to equal 0.74, and MSEL Verbal IQ scores to equal 0.83. An Early Learning Composite of the MSEL (MSEL-Early Learning Composite) can be calculated based on scores from four scales for children aged 0 -69 months. One paper82considering the measurement properties of the MSEL-Early Learning Composite was reviewed. This study82assessed known-groups validity and found all relevant hypotheses to be supported. Stanford -Binet Intelligence Scales-Fifth Edition The SB5177evaluates general intellectual abilities. The full-scale IQ is derived from the Verbal and Non-verbal scales, each with five subtests bearing the same names: Fluid reasoning, Knowledge,Quantitative reasoning, Visual spatial processing and Working memory. One paper, 175considering the measurement properties of the SB5, was reviewed. Grondhuis and Mulick175assessed known-groups validity and found that only two of the study 's four hypotheses were supported. This same study175also assessed convergent validity and found the non-verbal SB5 to be moderately correlated (ICC =0.66) with the Leiter-R. Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WPPSI-R)178,179assesses the intelligence of children aged between 3 and 7 years. One paper180considering the measurement properties of the WPPSI-R was reviewed. Yang et al.180assessed responsiveness and found R-squared for change in IQ from time 1 to time 2 was 0.50 in the total sample, and 0.37 in the ASD sample only. Attention For details, see Table 13. Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition The Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition (BASC-2)181is a widely used tool for assessing behaviour and emotions in children, adolescents and young adults, ranging in age from 2 to 25 years old. The BASC-2 consists of a Structured Developmental History, an Observation System, a Parent Rating Scale, a Self-Report of Personality Scale and a Teacher Rating Scale. Two papers182,183 considering measurement properties of the BASC were reviewed. Hass et al.182found internal consistency of the Teacher Rating Scale only, as measured by Cronbach 's alpha, to range from 0.66 to 0.85 for the Attention problems subscale. The absence of a factor analysis, however, led this paper to be judged to beof poor methodological quality. This same paper 182assessed known-groups validity of the Teacher Rating Scale and found significant difference between groups on the Attention problems subscale. Mahan and Matson183assessed the known-groups validity of the Parent Rating Scale only, and found support for the hypothesis that the ASD group would score higher on the Attention problems subscale. Child Behavior Checklist 1.5 -5 The CBCL 1.5 -5184is a norm-referenced measure that assesses for a wide range of emotional and behavioural disorders in children aged 1.5 -5 years. It has 99 items, reported by parents on a three-point scale. Pandolfi et al.185found internal consistency, as measured by Cronbach 's alpha, for items relevant to Attention Problems to equal 0.68.

One study186considering measurement properties of this version of the CBCL 6 -18 was reviewed. Internal consistency was good, with a median scale reliability of r=0.83 for Attention Problems. Structural validity missed the cut-off for the Attention Problems scale [RMSEA >0.06; comparative fit index (CFI) =0.955]. Emotional regulation For details, see Table 14. Baby and Infant Screen for Children with aUtIsm Traits-Part 2 The BISCUIT-Part 2 is a 65-item parent questionnaire that was developed to assess infants and toddlers for comorbid mental health conditions reported as common in children with ASD. Internal consistency was reported as good,83,187,188as was inter-rater reliability.188The sample size was rather small for an adequate assessment of structural validity.187The BISCUIT-Part 2 was able to distinguish between children with and without ASD in two papers.187,188Finally, Matson, Fodstad et al.188provided supportive evidence of the criterion validity of the BISCUIT-Part 2, showing that scores were correlated as expected with diagnosticcategorisation made by psychologists. Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition The BASC-2 is tool widely used for assessing behaviour and emotions in children and young people(see Attention , above). Hass et al. 182used the Teacher Rating Scale and reported that the BASC-2 had acceptable internal consistency for children (n =30) for the Anger control ( =0.75), Emotional self-control (=0.86) and Anxiety ( =0.88) scales. There were significant differences between ASD and matched control groups for the Anxiety (Cohen 'sd=1.23), Anger control (Cohen 'sd=1.89) and Emotional self-control scales (Cohen 'sd=1.94). A second paper183also assessed known-groups validity of the BASC-2 using the Parent Rating Scale. ASD children scored significantly greater than typically developingchildren on the Depression subscale, but did not differ as expected on the anxiety and internalisingcomposite scales. Brief Infant -Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment The Brief Infant -Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) is a 42-item screener for parents and child-care providers, designed to identify children with social emotional/behaviour problems. The BITSEA hastwo scales: BITSEA/P measures emotional and behavioural problems, and BITSEA/C measures competence.Measurement properties were assessed in two papers. 189,190Assessment of internal consistency was judged as methodologically poor in both papers.189,190Test -retest reliability was acceptable with 10- to 45-day test ICCs of 0.87 for BITSEA/P and 0.85 for BITSEA/C.189Ratings by both parents were significantly correlated in both Briggs-Gowan et al.189(ICC=0.68 for correlation =0.66 for BITSEA/P and 0.63 for BITSEA/C). However, agreement did not reach the COSMIN cut-off for acceptable inter-rater agreement. Agreement between parent and child-care providerwas lower than between parents. 189Hypothesis testing showed that the BITSEA had good convergent and divergent validity, and distinguished between toddlers with and without diagnosable social and emotional problems. Child Behavior Checklist 1.5 -5 T h eC B C L1 . 5 -5 behaviour scale was assessed by one paper185of good methodological quality. This paper185 provided evidence of good internal consistency for the Internalising Behaviour domain (Cronbach 's>0.70) but was just below the COSMIN cut-off for the Emotionally reactive subscale (0.67) and the Anxious/depressedsubscale (0.63). Structural validity was good overall, supporting the original factor structure of the Internalising and Externalising domains.

Child Behavior Checklist 6- 18 The CBCL 6 -18191was assessed with a sample of 122 ASD youth (6 -18 years) in one paper186of good methodological quality. Internal consistency was good, with a median scale reliability of r=0.94 for anxious/depressed and 0.85 for withdrawn/depressed. Structural validity good for Anxious/ depressed (RMSEA <0.06; CFI =0.995) (RMSEA >0.06; CFI =0.975). Overall, the analysis supported the original factor structure of the CBCL 6-18. Criterion validity was assessed by comparing ASD children with and without a co-occurring emotional and behavioural difficulty (EBD). Children with a co-occurring EBD scored significantly higher than those without EBDs on Anxious/depressed and Withdrawn/depressed subscales and on the Internalising domain. Children 's Global Assessment Scale The Children 's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)192is a measure of overall psychosocial functioning (including home, school, with peers and across other settings). One study193was identified that measured responsiveness in a large sample of children attending child psychiatric outpatient services, including 1053 participants with ASD. Mean CGAS ratings improved between first visit to outpatient services and at case closure after treatment (the raters were not the clinicians involved in treatment but did have access tobaseline rating when making the end-point rating). Change in CGAS ratings was significantly moderately correlated with clinician assessment of treatment response (r =0.47). Infant -Toddler Social -Emotional Assessment The 169-item Infant- -Emotional Assessment (ITSEA)194is a parent-completed questionnaire assesses three broad problem domains -Externalising, Internalizing and Dysregulation -along with Competence. Visser et al.195failed to report statistics for scale reliability (but did report mean ICCs of 0.7) for mothers and fathers, indicating acceptable inter-rater reliability. Visser et al.195and Georgiades et al.82 both demonstrated that the ITSEA could distinguish between diagnostic groups. ITSEA Internalising and Externalising domains also correlated positively with the corresponding Internalising and Externalisingdomains of the CBCL and the Distraction and Mood scales of the Parenting Stress Index, 195supporting convergent validity. Physical skills For details, see Table 15 . Mullen Scales of Early Learning The MSEL163offer a developmental test for young children aged 0 -69 months (see Cognitive ability , above), which includes direct assessment of fine motor skills, and in children of <30 months gross motor skills are also examined. Burns et al.164found, as hypothesised, that children with developmental delays present significantly more difficulties regarding fine motor skills than typically developing children matchedfor age, race and gender. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales The VABS167provide a structured interview measuring adaptive behaviour in four main domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialisation and Motor Skills. Motor Skills is measured only for childrenof<6 years of age. One study 168showed that children with autism made significant developmental progress in the Motor Skills domain of the VABS, from pretest to year 1 and year 2.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk56TABLE 15 Summary of quality: physical skills Test unknown, owing poor methodological quality; blank cell, no evidence available.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Charman et al.112examined developmental change in children 's profiles over 11 months. The sample of 40 children gained 5.5 age-equivalent months in Motor Skills. Also paired t-tests indicated that age equivalents at time 2 were significantly higher than at time 1 for Motor Skills. Social communication For details, see Table 16. Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised Fourteen papers63,65-72,139,140,146,196,197were reviewed considering measurement properties of the ADI-R in relation to Communication. Four studies63,68,139,146assessed internal consistency, which found Cronbach 's alpha coefficient from 0.45 to 0.83 for the Communication domain. Six studies63,65,67,69,71,196assessed inter-rater reliability of the Communication domain; 78% agreement was reported between raters by Robertson et al.196and kappa statistics ranging from 0.69 to 1.0.63,65,67,69,71The small sample size of three studies63,71,112,195led these papers to be judged as methodologically poor. One paper140found test -retest reliability for the Communication domain to be 0.73. However, the small sample size (n =20) led this paper140to be judged as being of poor methodological quality. Two studies63,66assessed content validity and found that most items were considered relevant for the construct to be measured. Seven papers assessed structural validity providing contradictory conclusions (see Autism symptom severity , above). One paper197found good structural validity for 28 social communication items but the paper was judged of poor quality. Three studies66,68,146assessed convergent validity and found correlations between the ADI-R Communication domains and the VABS, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), the Children 's Yale -Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, the Child 's Symptom Inventory, the Ritvo -Freeman Real Life Rating Scale, the Expressive Vocabulary Test and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test to range from -0.47 to 0.30. Three studies63,69,196assessed known-groups validity and found >75% of the study hypotheses were supported. One study70assessed criterion validity and found the correlation between the ADI-R Communication domain and clinician impression to equal 0.49. Two studies65,71assessed responsiveness and found that 75% of the hypotheses regarding stability in scores were supported. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic The original ADOS study50assessed internal consistency and found Cronbach 's alpha coefficients to range from 0.74 to 0.84 for the Communication domain. Three studies50,65,72, assessed inter-rater reliability. Two of these studies65,72found kappa statistics to range from 0.60 and 0.80 on all items. However, the lack of methodological information regarding these analyses led the study by Kamp-Becker et al.72to be judged as having poor methodological quality. Lord et al.50reported good inter-rater reliability (ICC =0.84) and test-retest reliability (ICC =0.73) for the Communication domain across modules. Conclusions regarding structural validity, criterion validity and for responsiveness were as described for symptom severity(see Autism symptom severity , above). Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Toddler Module Luyster et al.76presented the new Toddler Module of the ADOS (see Autism symptom severity , above). Internal consistency for all groupings was high (younger and non-verbal children: =0.88; verbal =0.90) for the Social Affect score. For inter-rater reliability, ICCs for the Social Affect total were 0.84 and 0.99, respectively; however, the small sample size ( n=13) led this to be judged as being of poor methodological quality. Test -retest reliability ICCs were 0.83 and 0.94; however, there were only eight children assessed twice in the older verbal group.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk58TABLE 16 Summary of quality: social communication consistencyReliability ContentvalidityStructuralvalidityHypothesis Test -retest Change Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (14) +++ ? ++ +++ + /- --- +++ - ++ Autism Diagnostic ObservationSchedule-Generic (6)? + + + +++ + /- ++ Autism Diagnostic ObservationSchedule-Toddler Module (1)++ ? + Early Social Communication Scales Live (1) ?

One study129assessed inter-rater reliability, and found that the average inter-rater reliability for this tool was 88.33%. Yet, owing to the small sample size for assessment of this property ( n=16), the paper was judged to be of poor methodological quality. Social Communication Assessment for Toddlers with Autism The SCATA137was designed to measure non-verbal communication, including early and atypical communication, in young children with ASD. Drew et al.137assessed inter-rater reliability and found the ICCs to range from 0.03 to 1.00, with 16 results of <0.70 and 24 results of >0.70. This same study135 assessed known-groups validity and found most of the results to be in accordance with the hypotheses.However, the small sample sizes ( n=17 and n=23) led both assessments from this study 135to be judged as of poor methodological quality. Social functioning For details, see Table 17. Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised Twelve papers63,64-71,139,140,146considering measurement properties of the Reciprocal Social Interaction domain of the ADI-R were reviewed. Four studies63,68,112,139,146assessed internal consistency; Cronbach 's alpha coefficients were consistently good for Reciprocal Social Interaction, and higher than for other domains. Five studies63,65,67,69,71assessed inter-rater reliability and reported kappa statistics to range from 0.64 to 1.0. The small sample size of two studies63,71led these papers to be judged as being methodologically poor. One paper140found test -retest reliability for Reciprocal Social Interaction to be 0.84. However, the small sample size ( n=20) led this paper to be judged as being of poor methodological quality. Two studies63,66assessed content validity and found that most items were considered to be relevant for the construct to be measured. Seven papers63,64-66,69,70,71assessed structural validity providing contradictory conclusions (see Autism symptom severity , above). Two studies64,66assessed convergent/ divergent validity. The former found ADI-R Reciprocal Social Interaction correlated with VABS scores as hypothesised, -0.41 to -0.45 (below the COSMIN criterion) and not with motor skills. Two studies63,69 assessed known-groups validity and all of the study hypotheses were supported regarding Reciprocal SociaI Interaction. One study70assessed criterion validity and found the correlation between ADI-R Reciprocal Social Interaction and clinician impression to equal 0.46. Two studies65,71assessed responsiveness and found that all of the hypotheses regarding stability were supported. Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form The Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF)198is a rating scale designed to assess social competence and behaviour problems in children and adolescents with developmental disabilities. It has 76 items, completed by parents or teachers. Lecavalier et al.199assessed internal consistency and found alpha coefficients for the social competence items to range from 0.63 to 0.85 in a sample of 330 children andadolescents with ASD. Lecavalier et al. 146assessed inter-rater reliability and report ICCs between the parent and teacher ratings to range from 0.17 to 0.23 on the social competence items. Their sample was293 children with ASD, of whom one-third attended preschool or kindergarten. Test -retest reliability was also assessed, 146and ICCs ranged from 0.63 to 0.73 for the social competence items. One study199 assessing structural validity found RMSEA ranging from 0.000 to 0.031 for the social competence items.Lecavalier et al. 146assessed convergent validity and found Spearman ranked correlation coefficients between Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) and the social competence items of the NCBRF to range from 0.41 to 0.45.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk60TABLE 17 Summary of quality: social functioning consistencyReliability ? ++ +++ --- -- +++ - ++ Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (2)++ -- ++ - unknown, owing poor methodological quality; blank cell, no evidence available.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Tyminski and Moore200assessed test -retest reliability and found that follow-up VABS Socialisation scores were positively related to baseline VABS scores ( r=0.74). Known-groups validity was assessed by Paul et al.,169 who reported a significant difference between groups of children with autism and those with ASD in the Socialisation domain, as expected. Harris et al.201assessed responsiveness and found that children made significant improvements in the Socialisation domain. However, the small sample size ( n=20) led this study to be judged as being methodologically poor. One paper170considered measurement properties of the classroom edition of the VABS. This study170assessed convergent validity and found a correlation between Autism Severity, as measured by CARS and VABS-Classroom socialisation scale to equal -0.58. Measurement properties of the VABS-Screener171were assessed by Charman et al. ,112who reported that the change score for the Socialisation domain was significant, with children making 9 months 'progress in 11 months. Play For details, see Table 18 . Test of Pretend Play The Test of Pretend Play (ToPP)202is an assessment of symbolic play ability in young children (aged between 18 months and 6 years). It assesses how children substitute one object for another, and refer to an absent object, as if it was present, and attribute an imaginary property to an object. Only one study203 in our review investigated measurement properties of the ToPP. Clift et al.203reported a moderate positive correlation between the ToPP scores and language scores ( r=0.41), measured by FirstSTEP, a screening assessment used to identify children who may be at risk of developmental delay. The study203showed also that the ToPP correctly classified 75.9% of the participants (children with developmental problems and/or a psychological disorder, and typically developing children). Behaviour problems For details, see Table 19. Aberrant Behavior Checklist The ABC204is a 58-item caregiver report checklist designed to assess maladaptive behaviours in people with developmental disabilities. The ABC was assessed in three studies.205-7Internal consistency was reported as good (Cronbach 's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.68 to 0.90) by Karabekiroglu and Aman,205whereas inter-rater reliability was reported as poor by Sigafoos et al.206(mean Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient between parent and teacher ratings was 0.62, range 0.50 -0.83). Brinkley et al.207demonstrated that the ABC had good structural validity, although the irritability subscale item placement did not match the standard ABC factor structure. One note of caution here is that in the ASD sample items on self-injury clustered into one factor and the remaining items from the standard ABC irritability subscale shifted to the hyperactivitysubscale. Sigafoos et al. 206also showed that the ABC had good structural validity, with five factors that closely matched the standard ABC factor structure; however, because of the small sample size ( n=32) this paper was judged of poor methodological quality. Known-groups validity and criterion validity were shown to beacceptable by Karabekiroglu and Aman. 205The ABC distinguished between clinical subgroups and showed significant positive correlations with related constructs measured by the CBCL and the AuBC. Baby and Infant Screen for Children with aUtIsm Traits-Part 3 The BISCUIT-Part 383was designed to assess challenging behaviours. Internal consistency of the BISCUIT-Part 3 was reported as good with Cronbach 's alpha coefficient of >0.70 in two papers.83,208 Structural validity, assessed in Matson et al.208was not acceptable, with EFA resulting in a three-factor solution explaining just 38.32% of the variance.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk62TABLE 18 Summary of quality: play ContentvalidityStructuralvalidityHypothesis testing CriterionvalidityResponsiveness Test -retest unknown, owing to poor methodological quality; blank cell, no evidence available.

Hass et al.182showed that the BASC-2 had acceptable internal consistency for the 10-item Aggression scale and the nine-item Conduct problem scale.There were also significant large differences between children with ASD and matched control subjectson the Aggression scale (Cohen 'sd=0.58) and the Externalising problems composite scale (Cohen 's d=0.75). Mahan and Matson 183also assessed known-groups validity of the BASC-2. ASD children scored significantly greater than typically developing children on the Conduct problems and Externalisingcomposite scales but did not differ as expected on the Aggression subscale. Child Behavior Checklist 1.5 -5 The CBCL 1.5 -5 Behaviour scale was assessed by one paper185of good methodological quality. This paper provided evidence of good internal consistency for total problems (Cronbach' s=0.93) and both the Externalising Behaviour domain (Cronbach 's=0.90) and Aggressive behaviour subscale (Cronbach' s =0.80). Structural validity was also good, with acceptable model fit for a one-factor model for aggressive behaviour (RMSEA <0.06; CFI >0.95), indicating that there was a single latent factor underlying this subscale. Child Behavior Checklist 6- 18 The CBCL 6 -18191was assessed with a sample of ASD youth in one paper186of good methodological quality. Internal consistency was good, with r=0.92 for the Aggressive behaviour scale. Structural validity for the complete measure was good, and analysis supported the original two-factor structure of the CBCL6-18 (internalising and externalising factors). Tests of unidimensionality of scales did not reach the cut-off for acceptable fit for aggressive behaviour (RMSEA =0.10; CFI =0.95); however, convincing arguments were provided to allow for correlated disturbances in the model for two-item pairs (destroys own things/destroys others things and disobedient at home/disobedient at school). This adjusted model demonstrated acceptable fit (RMSEA <0.06; CFI >0.95). Finally, criterion validity was assessed by comparing ASD children with and without a co-occurring EBD. Children with a co-occurring EBD scored significantly higher than those without EBDs on total problems. There were no significant differences between the two groupsfor aggressive behaviour or externalising behaviour. Given that the most commonly co-occurring EBDs were anxiety disorders, it is reasonable to assume that in this sample we would not expect to see group differences in aggressive or externalising behaviour. Home Situations Questionnaire-Pervasive Developmental Disorders version The Home Situations Questionnaire-Pervasive Developmental Disorders version (HSQ-PDD) is caregiverquestionnaire designed to assess behavioural non-compliance in everyday situations by children with ASD. It was developed in studies of typically developing children, and was modified by Chowdhury et al. 209and its properties assessed in a sample of 124 children with ASD, aged 4 -13 years. Structural validity for a two-factor solution was a reasonable fit (RMSEA 0.06) and internal consistency good for the 25-itemversion thus derived ( =0.90 for =0.80 for Demand-specific subscale). Known-groups validity and responsiveness (change over time) were also good for the HSQ-PDD. Responsiveness was shown related as hypothesised to change in the VABS Daily living skills scale. 210 Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form The NCBRF198is a rating scale designed to assess social competence and problem behaviour in children with developmental disabilities. There are parent and teacher versions of the scale. Internal consistency of the problem behaviour scales was reported as good, with Cronbach 's alpha coefficient of >0.70 for all subscales in both parent and teacher versions.199Test -retest reliability for the parent version was reported to be strong (ICC for total problem behaviour >0.80) but the teacher version fell short of the COSMIN criterion (ICC for total problem behaviour =0.68); however, over a 1-year time interval some change might well be expected. Agreement was low between parents and teachers on common items from the parentSYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk64and teacher version of the scale, indicating that inter-rater reliability was poor.146Structural validity was also shown to be poor for problem behaviour with a five-factor solution accounting for 47.5% of the variance.199Finally, Lecavalier et al.146provided fair evidence for divergent and convergent validity of the NCBRF. Habit problems For details, see Table 20 . Child Behavior Checklist 1.5 -5 The CBCL1841.5-5 was originally shown to measure two higher-order factors (internalising and externalising behaviour) and seven second-order factors (emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somaticcomplaints, withdrawn, attention problems, aggressive behaviour and sleep problems). One study 185of good quality assessed the CBCL 1.5 -5 in an ASD sample. Internal consistency was good for total scale and sleep problems ( >0.80) but not acceptable for somatic complaints ( =0.49). Structural validity was not acceptable for sleep problems (RMSEA =0.13) but was acceptable for somatic complaints (RMSEA =0.06), just reaching the cut-off for acceptable fit. Overall, the findings supported the original structure of the CBCL 1.5 -5 but there were conflicting findings for the scales related to the Habit Problems domain. Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 The CBCL 6 -18191was assessed with a sample of ASD youth in one paper186of good methodological quality. Internal consistency was good, with a median scale reliability of r=0.85 and r=0.88 for somatic complaints. Structural validity was also strong for somatic complaints (RMSEA <0.001; CFI =1) and analysis supported the original factor structure of the CBCL 6 -18. Criterion validity was assessed by comparing ASD children with and without a co-occurring EBD. Children with a co-occurring EBD scored significantly higher than those without EBDs on total problems and on the Somatic complaints subscale. Sense and Self-Regulation Checklist Silva and Schalock,211provided an assessment of the properties of the SSC (see Sensory processing , above). Internal consistency was rated as good with Cronbach 's alpha coefficient of >0.80 (range from 0.85 to 0.89). Although test -retest reliability overall did not reach the cut-off, the reliability coefficient was 0.83 for the Self-Regulation domain. This relates most closely to habit problems and so was consideredsupportive evidence of test -retest reliability. This paper 211also demonstrated that the SSC was able to distinguish between children with and without ASD. Daily living skills For details, see Table 21. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales The VABS (see Language and social functioning , above) had two papers168,169that assessed domain-level validity169and responsiveness,168respectively. Paul et al.169demonstrated that children with autism and ASD differed on Communication and Socialisation domains but not on the Daily Living Skills domain. Groupsdid differ on 'phone use ', which is part of the DLS scale but was deemed to be more relevant to verbal communication than daily living skills. Hypotheses were not specifically set out in the paper and so it was rated as 'fair'quality. Harris et al. 168assessed rate of change and change in developmental age. This paper168 showed that VABS was able to identify change over time but was of poor quality due to the small sample size ( n<20).DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Each domain has 15-54 items: 228 in total.Wang et al. 213assessed the internal consistency of the Social domain only and found the Cronbach 's alpha coefficient to be 0.98. The same study213assessed the tool' s responsiveness, and found significant change in the Social domain from pre-test and post test, as hypothesised. However, owing to the smallsample size ( n=22), both assessments from this paper were judged to be of poor methodological quality. Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition The BASC-2181is a tool for assessing behaviour and emotions in children, adolescents and young adults (see Attention , above). Hass et al.182report internal consistency of the Teacher Rating Scale, as measured by Cronbach' s alpha, to range from 0.76 to 0.90 for the Adaptive Functioning subscales. The absence of a factor analysis, however, led this paper to be judged as being of poor methodological quality. Mahan and Matson183assessed the known-groups validity of the Parent Rating Scale and found that all relevant hypotheses were supported. Psychoeducational Profile-Revised The Psychoeducational Profile-Revised (PEP-R)214is used to assess abilities and formulate treatment programmes for children with autism and related developmental disorders. The tool consists of a Developmental scale, with a total of 153 items, and a Behavioural scale, with a total of 43 items. Four studies215 -218assessed the internal consistency of the tool' s Developmental scale and found that Cronbach' s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.81 to 0.99. Three of these studies216 -218also assessed internal consistency of the Behavioural scale and found that Cronbach 's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.74 to 0.99. However, none of these studies included a factor analysis, and therefore all assessments were judged to be of poor methodological quality. Three studies215,216,218assessed the inter-rater reliability of the Developmental scale and found ICC values ranged from 0.84 to 0.99. Shek et al.216and Villa et al.218assessed the inter-rater reliability of the Behavioural scale and found that ICC values ranged from 0.56 to 0.88. Owing to smallsample size, Alwinesh et al. 215was judged to be of poor methodological quality. Two studies215,216assessed the test -retest reliability of the Developmental scale and found ICC values ranging from 0.87 to 0.99. Shek et al.216assessed the test -retest reliability of the Behavioural scale and found ICC values ranging from 0.76 to 0.92. Steerneman et al.217and Heimann et al.219both assessed known-groups validity and, in both, the relevant hypotheses were supported. However, the small sample size led the second study219to be judged as being of poor methodological quality. Two studies215,217assessed the tool' s convergent validity and s Developmental Schedule to range from 0.34 to 0.84.215Criterion validity was assessed by two studies,216,218and found correlations between PEP-R Developmental Score and VABS to equal 0.85,218and correlations between the PEP-R Developmental scale and Merrill -Palmer Scale of Mental Tests to equal 0.71.216Heimann et al.219assessed responsiveness andDOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

However, the small sample size ( n=20) meant that this study219was judged to be of poor methodological quality. Psychoeducational Profile-Third Edition The third edition of the Psychoeducational Profile (PEP-3)220is specifically designed for children with ASD -ranging in developmental age from 2 years to 7 years 6 months -to assess their development of communication and motor skills and the presence of maladaptive behaviours. It consists of 10 performance subtests that are combined into three composites: Communication, Motor, and Maladaptive behaviours. Fuet al.221tested a Chinese translation; they assessed internal consistency and found Cronbach 's alpha coefficients to range from 0.92 to 0.98. The same study221assessed inter-rater reliability, and found ICC of the PEP-3 ranged from 0.57 to 0.94 for the performance subtests, and 0.63 to 0.89 for the composites(4 out of 13 ICCs were <0.70). This study also assessed measurement error, and found that the standard error measurement of the PEP-3 ranged from 2.6 to 6.5 for composite scores, whereas the smallest real difference of the PEP-3 ranged from 5.8 to 12.8. Chen et al. 222assessed responsiveness and found that composite scores and most of the subtest scores of the PEP-3 changed in raw scores and developmentalages, but were stable in percentile ranks. Owing to the absence of specific hypotheses, this study 222 was judged to be of poor methodological quality. Measurement properties of the Caregiver report of the PEP-3 were reviewed by Fu et al.,223who assessed internal consistency and found Cronbach 's alpha coefficients to range from 0.15 to 0.85. However, as no factor analysis was conducted, this study223was judged to be of poor methodological quality. The same study223assessed inter-rater reliability and found the ICCs of the subtests ranged from 0.66 to 0.79, and criterion validity reporting correlation coefficients between the PEP-3-Caregiver and the VABS ranged from 0.04 to 0.82. However, the small sample size ( n=20) meant that this study was judged to be methodologically poor. Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised The Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised (SIB-R)224is a comprehensive norm-referenced test used to assess adaptive behaviour. It contains 14 subscales distributed into four areas: (1) Motor Skills; (2) Socialand Communication Skills; (3) Personal Living Skills; and (4) Community Living Skills. Lecavalier et al. 146 assessed internal consistency and found Cronbach 's alpha coefficients to range from 0.87 to 0.96. The same study146also assessed known-groups validity, and found support for the hypothesis. Brown et al.225assessed convergent validity and found that Full Scale IQ did not positively correlate with Broad Independence, andthat Verbal IQ did not positively correlate with Social Interaction, as expected. However, the small sample size ( n=25) led this study to be judged as being of poor methodological quality. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Paul et al.169explored the domains and subdomains of the VABS and assessed known-groups validity, finding support for all of their relevant hypotheses. Harris et al.168assessed responsiveness. A series of significant differences at years 1 and 2 were presented, but, owing to the lack of specific hypotheses, it isdifficult to determine if the results were as expected. Therefore, the methodological quality of the paper was judged as poor. Wells et al. 170examined the measurement properties of the classroom edition of the VABS and reported convergent validity between the VABS-Classroom adaptive behaviour composite and CARS (r =-0.53). The responsiveness of the Screener version of the VABS171was assessed.112The VABS-Screener age-equivalent domain scores showed clear evidence of developmental progress from times 1 to 2, although change in the composite score was not significant.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Autism Parenting Stress Index The Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI)226,227is a caregiver questionnaire designed for clinical use to identify what aspects of parenting skills would benefit from additional support, and to measure the outcome of intervention on parenting stress relative to core and comorbid symptoms of a child' s autism. The measure consists of three categories: the core social disability, difficult-to-manage behaviour andphysical issues. All of the items are rated on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 'not stressful 'to'so stressful that sometimes we feel we cannot cope '. Only one study 153has examined the measurement properties of the APSI, collecting data from parents of 274 children aged <6 years (including 109 children with ASD). Authors reported good internal consistency and 4-month test- retest reliability (however, a subsample of only 18 parents was used). The factor analysis of the APSI revealed a four-factor solution (overall parental stress scale; core autism symptoms; comorbid behaviours; comorbid physical issues); however, the explained variance is not stated. The APSI discriminated between children with ASD andthose who are typically developing or have other developmental delays. Parenting Stress Index-Short Form The PSI-SF228is a 36-item self-report questionnaire measuring parenting stress. It contains three subscales: Parental distress, Parent -child dysfunctional interaction, and Difficult child (the extent to which the parent considers the child to be 'difficult '). Items are rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 'strongly agree 'to'strongly disagree '. Three studies reported data on measurement properties of the PSI-SF. Lecavalier et al.146reported excellent internal consistency for the total score (Cronbach' s=0.93). Good internal consistency for the subscales, and support for a primary dimension for each of the PSI-SFsubscales, were reported by Zaidman-Zait et al. 229However, in Zaidman-Zait et al.230the three-factor model was rejected and a six-factor solution was suggested. Parenting stress was showed to be stable across time (over 1-year period) and associated with behaviour problems,146greater severity of autism and other psychological problems.230 Questionnaire on Resources and Stress-Friedrich Short Form The Questionnaire on Resources and Stress-Friedrich Short Form (QRS-F)231is a 52-item questionnaire assessing the level of stress in families of children with disabilities. It contains four subcomponents of parental perceptions of difficulties: parent and family problems (stressful aspects of the impact of the child with disability on parents and the wider family), pessimism (parents 'pessimistic beliefs about the child 's future), child characteristics (features of the child that are associated with increased demands on parents) and physical incapacity (the extent to which the child is able to perform a range of typical activities). Honey et al.232investigated measurement properties of the QRS-F. A total of 174 mothers and 43 fathers of a child with autism aged between 26 and 82 months completed 31 items from the QRS-F (from the child characteristics, parent and family problems and pessimism scales). The authors reported good internal consistency for the total score. Support for the expected two- or three-factor solutions for the QRS-F was not found. The study232showed convergent validity of the QRS-F, with parents reporting more stress when raising children with more severe symptoms of autism and less stress if children were more able(as indicated by higher VABS scores).SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk70TABLE 23 Summary of quality: parent stress consistencyReliability ContentvalidityStructuralvalidityHypothesis testing CriterionvalidityResponsiveness Test -retest Inter-raterConvergent/divergentvalidityKnowngroups Stability Change Autism Parenting Stress Index (1) +++ ?? ++ Parenting Stress Index-ShortForm (3)+++ +++ + + Questionnaire on Resources and Stress-Friedrich Short Form (1)+ ? + +++ ++or--, moderate unknown, owing poor methodological quality; blank cell, no evidence available.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Nine other tools will not be considered further, either because the quality of the evidence provided in thepaper(s) was of poor quality or the only measurement property evidence suggested that the tool was weak. Unsurprisingly, the most evidence has been gathered for tools that were developed especially for use with children with ASD. Content validity has been accepted for this review as strong, even although it may notbe represented in the tables; choice of autism characteristic items was assumed to have been addressed in other publications not considered in this review, as their focus would be on measurement properties concerning screening or diagnostic accuracy. There are some recurring issues with evidence concerningtest-retest reliability, as this measurement property was not assessed or because the sample sizes were small, or the evidence reviewed was found to be inconsistent. Despite the fact that one of the main aims of the review was to assess the property of responsiveness to change, there appears a dearth of evidence about which tools may have the capacity to track children 's progress over time. In the case of tools such as the ADOS-G, designed to capture unusual quality ofbehaviours in order to aid diagnostic assessment, the property of stability in assessment may have beendemonstrated and, in principle, this would allow detection of unexpected change. However, when a tool has been developed to measure a stable quality, the tool items may be insensitive to small changes in response to treatment. Even for the tools designed explicitly for the purpose of measuring change in response tointervention -ATEC and PDDBI -the evidence was limited. Some discussion of possible 'newer 'tools will be included in Chapter 5 . The review also uncovered little evidence about the measurement properties of standardised assessments (e.g. of language, cognition and play) and for many questionnaires (e.g. assessing behaviour, attention and emotional regulation) when used with or about young children with ASD. Although for an individualchild, the purpose of conducting an assessment may be to make comparison with patterns of typicaldevelopment, this should be informed by a knowledge of what adjustments may need to be made to tools to take into account the particular ways in which children with ASD think and behave (content validity). For example, there is evidence that children with ASD on average have more expressive language thanwould typically be expected for their level of understanding of language. 233Also the relative significance attributed to the observation that a young child chooses to play alone may not be the same for a childwith ASD compared with their more typically developing peers. This review has highlighted that there is relatively little information about inter-rater and test- retest reliability for questionnaire tools. Parents and teachers rating the behaviours of young children may well not agree, as they are likely to be observing the children in very different circumstances. However, the lack of test -retest reliability is concerning, and it would be appropriate for an agreed standard for an appropriate time interval between assessments to be agreed. In our consultation with professionals (see Chapter 2 ), a number of tools were identified which are used in nurseries and other early years settings to monitor progress. We included in searches the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile; however, we identified no evidence about whether it has good measurementproperties when used with children with ASD. The emphasis in early education tools is to record and monitor steps in building up skills, so that staff can plan learning activities for children. For this reason it would be reassuring to know whether one staff member made similar ratings to another staff member.The tools evaluated in the subdomain Global Measure of Functioning also included some that are used for individual programme planning (e.g. the AEPS, the Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills), again with insufficient information for their validity and appropriateness in use with young childrenwith ASD.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF MEASUREMENT PROPERTIES OF TOOLS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk72We have found no evidence concerning tools that can describe and measure some of the aspects of children 's social participation and well-being (valued by parents as important, see Chapter 2 ). We do have evidence about some tools that measure behaviour problems and distress. We have no evidence about measures of family quality of life, but some about measuring parent stress. The issue of emphasis on measurement of 'problems 'rather than of strengths will be returned to in Chapter 5 .DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

This combined systematic review process appears to be unique in the field of autism. A few groups have previously made recommendations about batteries of tools for measuring outcome in autism (e.g. consensus decision by five research teams; 234descriptive review of tools used235). These batteries have not been adopted for use consistently across research groups, and the measures considered in the first of these are not all applicable to young children (being largely focused on outcomes of medication trials for adultswith autism and aggressive behaviour). Other papers review tools that have been frequently used: for example, Cunningham 236reviewed measures of social interaction in autism and made recommendations without a clear basis of evaluation. Other reviews of assessment batteries have focused on diagnosis.237 The field of autism research, practice and policy has expended massive efforts to standardise measurementpractice internationally, but with the predominant focus on improvement of assessment for diagnosis. Recently, the US Autism Speaks Foundation has supported expert work groups to evaluate outcome measurement tools in three subdomains: Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours; Anxiety; and Social Communication behaviours. 238 -240The purpose was to identify tools that were appropriate for use in medication trials. The expert groups identified, through systematic searches, tools used in treatment trials of medication, complementary medicine or behavioural interventions from 2005 to 2012, across any age group of children and youth with ASD. Other tools known to members of the work groups were alsoincluded. The tools were rated as: appropriate ,appropriate with conditions ,potentially appropriate/ promising ,unproven ornot appropriate. The definitions of each level included information on reliability, validity and sensitivity to change of the tool, use with individuals with ASD, and also aspects of burden interms of the time and other difficulties associated with use of the tool in assessment. In each case, a smallnumber of tools were identified as 'appropriate with conditions '(such as restricted age range or lack of information on sensitivity to change). That process of evidence synthesis provides a helpful model but could not be adopted for the MeASURe project, as the US group 's aim was different and narrower. The measurement properties and appropriateness of a tool vary depending on the use to which the tool will be put. In a randomised controlled trial of early intervention in ASD, for example, it is important to identify a primary outcome that can be assessed 'blind ' and is responsive to change. In contrast, when monitoring children 's progress in a nursery setting, properties of face validity, content validity, test -retest and inter-rater reliability, as well as burden (cost, training, time), will assume greater importance. The approach to evidence synthesis adopted in this chapter is incremental. First, we present descriptive information on the 41 tools for which some positive evidence was found concerning their measurementproperties (see Chapter 4 ). The information about some of these tools is amplified by points made by parents attending the advisory groups and by stakeholders who participated in the MeASURe DiscussionDay (14 February 2014, described in Chapter 2 ). Second, we will briefly comment on other tools for which we were unable to identify evidence on measurement properties when used with young children with ASD, which may yet turn out to be 'promising 'after further evaluation. Finally, we summarise the tools that may be, at present, the most appropriate choices, depending on the purposes of the researcher or clinician.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

The MeASURe project team designed the headings for the tables, to include name, source, what it is describedas measuring, method/respondent, potential for blinding, number of items/time taken, subscales, requiredinterval between repeat administrations, age range, entry criteria, whether norms or clinical cut-offs areavailable, population for which designed, cost/availability/languages and training required. The judgement of potential for blinding is made on the assumption that parents/caregivers will know whether a child is receiving an intervention. (However, in a medication trial, parent report may be a blind outcome.) Whenthe tool can be completed by education or other staff, there may be potential for blinding (although it would be poor practice for parents and staff not to communicate); there may also be potential for blinding where the parent is interviewed in a standard way to provide behavioural descriptions (and the parent hasbeen asked not to unblind the interviewer). Where sources give conflicting information, the most recent version is presented. Discussion Day As described in Chapter 2 , 25 participants came to a Discussion Day in London on February 2014, including parents, a young adult on the autism spectrum, researchers, and health and education professionals. In addition to the Q-sort activity described in Chapter 2 , participants were divided into mixed groupings and asked to evaluate tools set out on display (four sets for each grouping). The subdomains represented were symptom severity, global measure of outcome, sensory processing, cognitive ability, behaviour problems and parent stress. Two direct child assessments were shown, with videotapeaccompaniment. The questionnaire tools were presented in pairs to allow participants to compare and contrast. Summary information about each tool was available. Participants rated each tool for (1) the assessment experience (including questionnaire wording) and (2) how likely it would be to capture change.They were asked also to state what they liked or did not like about the tool. Descriptions of tools The order of the paragraphs follows the Conceptual Framework of subdomains (see Table 1 ). However, the 41 tools are described once only, in the subdomain table in which they are presented most fully(see Table 24 ). The observational and intervention evaluation studies in which they were used are listed in Appendix 5 . Autism symptom severity For details, see Table 24 . The AuBC was first published in 1978 and intended for the identification of autism in groups of childrenwith severe disabilities. The items describe specific behaviours, although some include evaluation (e.g. item19'Has special abilities in one area -seems to rule out mental retardation '). Some items were judged to apply to neurotypical development. The scoring instructions were described by the Discussion Dayparticipants as very confusing. However, the brevity of the scale was seen as positive. The participants didnot consider the items would pick up change. This tool was used in three observational and six intervention evaluation studies in the review. The evidence on measurement properties was limited. The ADI-R has been described in the literature as a 'gold standard' diagnostic tool. It has therefore been used in 15 longitudinal studies in this review, but not as an outcome measure in intervention. The time commitment to training and the cost of the tool are significant; the interview takes at least 2.5 hours butEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk76parents can find this investment of time and attention positive, as it allows them to describe in detail their child 's strengths and difficulties. There is strong evidence for its measurement properties. The ADOS was designed as a 'partner 'diagnostic tool for the ADI-R. It was used in 14 observational studies, and 11 intervention evaluation studies in this review. However, there is considerable debate as to whether or not the ADOS can be sensitive to change, as each rating is measured on a three- or four-point scale, and thefocus is on abnormalities of behaviour. A number of suggestions have been made for altered approaches toscoring 253to enhance responsiveness to change. Reliable administration and scoring of the ADOS requires specific training of assessors; there is a self-training pack but attendance at a course is advised (which can becostly) and required for research-level competence. That it can be carried out by a 'blind 'assessor is a definite strength. The participants at the Discussion Day were all positive about the child 's experience, as ADOS focuses on the child 's actual social and play behaviour. They did consider that it would capture change, although not for short-term interventions. However, it is only a 20- to 45-minute 'snapshot 'of behaviour in a structured setting; another potential limitation for its use as an outcome measure. The current version [Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2)], published in 2012, includes some small modifications to procedure and ratings, with a revised scoring algorithm, and now includes the ToddlerModule. The inclusion of five age- and ability-appropriate modules is a strength in allowing conceptuallylinked measurement longitudinally. The creation for ADOS-2 of a calibrated comparison score is intended to allow detection of changes over time but the utility of this score is yet to be evaluated. The AOSI was used in two observational studies in this review, having been designed for research assessment of infant siblings of children with autism. As yet the information on its measurement properties is limited. The BSE (revised, BSE-R) was developed in Tours, France; it was used in two European observational studies in this review and has been translated into English also, although its availability is unknown. It wasspecifically designed for professionals to monitor the progress of children in an autism-specific treatment nursery. The evidence on measurement properties is relatively strong. The Infant BSE derives from the same clinical research group, and was used in two observational studies in this review. The CARS combines observation of the child and interview with parents/carers to enable a clinician to rate 15 items each on a seven-point scale. The primary purpose of the tool is for diagnosis. The CARS-2 includes a version for high-functioning children, as the original was not sufficiently discriminative in makingdiagnosis. The evidence on reliability was strong. CARS was used in 10 observational studies and three intervention evaluation studies in this review. The GARS is primarily a parent questionnaire. It was used in four observational and four intervention evaluation studies in this review. The evidence on measurement properties was weak. The PDDRS is similar in purpose but with a different model underlying the subscales. It was used in one observational study inthis review and lacks evidence of validity. Three early screening tools were included, each having been used in one observational study, even although the tools are not primarily designed to measure outcome. The BISCUIT-Part 1, is a recentscreening questionnaire, part of a suite of three tools for children with ASD. Initial testing of measurement properties is promising but reliability is unknown. The POEMS is recently published. The M-CHAT is a well-established screening tool; it is intended to be used by clinicians with parents/caregivers, or can becompleted by parents themselves. The evidence concerning measurement properties is limited for both of these tools. The M-CHAT has a newly developed version, 249which includes first a parent questionnaire and then administration by a clinician. As tools to measure outcome, these are limited by the short age range for which they were designed.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.83The SCQ is a screening tool for all ages, and closely related to the ADI-R. It was used on one observational study and one intervention evaluation study in this review. The measurement properties evidence is relatively strong. The wording is, in places, complex (e.g. item 32: 'When she/he was 4 to 5, when she/he wanted something or wanted help, did she/he look at you and use gestures with sounds or words to get your attention? '); it was first developed with families who had already completed the ADI-R and so were familiar with they types of concepts included. The SRS was developed to identify children with ASD. The original version was applicable from 4 years of age, but the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2) includes a version for 2.5- to 4.5-year-olds. It was used in one intervention evaluation and two observational studies in this review. The measurementproperties evidence is relatively strong, but the validity of the subscales is weak. At the Discussion Day, participants 'opinions were generally favourable about the wording of items, as they include positive behaviours; however, parents commented that it would be difficult to complete item 29 (' Is regarded by other children as odd or weird '). The scale had clear instructions on how to complete it; however, a time frame of 6 months seemed too long for children in the age range up to 6 years. Participants thought that the scale would be likely to capture change. The linkage between age-related versions of the scale(into adulthood) is a strength. Global measure of outcome For details, see Table 25 . The two additional tools considered here also cover a range of symptoms of ASD, but have specifically been designed to capture change over time or with intervention. The ATEC is presented either as one page or can be completed (and scored) online. The evidence about its measurement properties is limited. It was used in one observational study in this review. Participants at the Discussion Day found the presentation of items crowded and the item wording too short (and some'unfriendly ', such as describing the child as 'indifferent 'or'insensitive '). Many of the behaviours would not be the focus of intervention and therefore might be unlikely to change. They considered that a three-point rating scale might not have sufficient range to capture progress. The parent version of the PDDBI is presented as six pages, with items scored on a four-point scale, with additional possibilities of 'U'(to indicate the child used to show this behaviour) or '?'(don 't know ). Participants at the Discussion Day found some of the language too technical and questioned the inclusion, for example, of detailed phonological skill items. Because of the large age range, some items are not appropriate for children aged <6 years. The emphasis was on frequency, not impact of behaviours. No time frame is given for the responses. The PDDBI was used in two intervention evaluation studies in this review. The evidence on measurement properties was relatively strong but did not include responsiveness. The Parent Interview for Autism-Clinical Version (PIA-CV) 254emerged as a 'new tool' from searches, but no study was found in which the tool has been used to measure change with intervention. More recently, the Autism Impact Measure (AIM) has been presented.255The AIM targets measurement of short-term change in core ASD symptoms, asking parents to indicate frequency and impact of 25 behaviours over a2-week recall period. The children in the development study were aged 2 -17 years. Future evidence on the sensitivity to change of the PIA-CV and the AIM will be of great interest. Furthermore, another tool targeted at the age group up to 6 years is in development, the Brief Observation of Communication Change (Lord, Columbia University, New York, personal communication, July 2013). This tool is a ratingof observed behaviours by a trained investigator, with categories based on ADOS ratings, as a child interacts in play with an adult. The 16 ratings are each on a six-point scale and the important metric is the difference from one occasion to another, in order to capture change.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk84Social awareness For details, see Table 26 . We now describe tools that focus on core early impairments in autism, first tools that measure aspects of social awareness. Many such tools were designed specifically for a particular study, such as coding ofobserved parent -child interaction (see Appendix 5 ). Such tools are generally related to the focus of the intervention, and information about measurement properties is restricted to reliability in that study. A number of other scales used were searched for by name but the evidence concerning measurement properties was limited or poor quality. The two scales for which some positive evidence was found focus on imitation. The IB and the PIPS were each used in one observational study in the review. The evidence on measurement properties was relativelystrong for the latter. Detailed information is presented in the papers referenced in the table. Repetitive behaviours and interests For details, see Table 27 . Repetitive interests and behaviours are a core feature of autism and have most often been measured with diagnostic tools in this review. However, the RBS-R was used in one intervention evaluation study. The evidence for its measurement properties is somewhat mixed, particularly structural validity, and athree-factor model may be stronger. Sensory processing For details, see Table 28 . The SSC is based in concepts from Chinese medicine, and was developed for use in evaluation of Qigong massage. Evidence on its measurement properties is limited. Participants in the Discussion Day noted that there is no 'not applicable 'response option for questions (e.g. about 'nappies '). The response scale measures frequency and not impact, without specification of a time frame. The phrasing of items was negative (e.g. 'haircuts are difficult '). The SP (and SSP) is a well-established clinical tool, although the review found little evidence onmeasurement properties in studies with children with ASD. Participants at the Discussion Day noted that the wording of items is negatively framed, the response scale captures frequency but not impact and thereis no time frame. The SP was used in three observational and two intervention evaluations in the review, and the SSP in three observational studies.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

The MCDI are used extensively, and were identified in this review in seven intervention evaluation studies and seven observational studies. Parents indicate which words, from a list of vocabulary, that their childcurrently understands, and which the child understands and says. We did not find evidence aboutreliability in use with children with ASD; however, a recent study of children with autism aged 2 -4 years found excellent agreement between parent and preschool teacher for the whole sample for both wordsproduced and words understood (ICC =0.93 and 0.77, respectively). 261Shortened versions have been created for many languages, which could then be used in UK. For both the direct assessments of language, the evidence for measurement properties in children with ASD was limited. The MSEL include two language scales. Both MSEL and the PLS are appropriate across the age range to 6 years. The PLS was used in nine observational studies and two intervention evaluation studies in this review. Cognitive ability For details, see Table 30 . The Leiter-R is a test of non-verbal intelligence, which may be advantageous for a range of children withneurodevelopmental impairments and limited language competence. As might be expected for a norm- referenced test, there is little specific evidence for the measurement properties of the Leiter, or the Stanford -Binet Intelligence Scales, in use with children with ASD. [We found no evidence for other such tests, such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) and the British Ability Scales (BAS).] The MSEL includes five subscales, four of which make up the Early Learning Composite. The participants at the Discussion Day appreciated that the tasks have simple, developmentally appropriate materials andseem more like playing than a test. However, others found the materials 'fiddly 'and not engaging. The participants commented that it would take a skilled administrator to avoid a child with ASD becominganxious about getting tasks wrong (as would also be the case for any standardised test). The inclusion ofMotor Skill domains was seen as an important part of the assessment, as this may be a particular area of weakness. The evidence about measurement properties in use with children with ASD did not include reliability. The MSEL was used in 32 studies included in the review, six of which were interventionevaluation studies. The scales measuring 'Attention 'are presented in later sections (see Behaviour problems and Global measure of functioning , below). Emotional regulation For details, see Table 31 . The BISCUIT-Part 2 is part of a set of three parent questionnaires. The evidence for its measurement properties was relatively strong, albeit all provided by the original research group. It was used in one observational study in this review. The remaining scales in this section are not ASD specific.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk92The Infant- Toddler Social -Emotional Assessment (and its Brief version) provides norms based on a national sample of children, including those who were preterm, had language delay, and children with other diagnosed disorders. The evidence for its measurement properties in children with ASD is relatively limited.The CBCL will be presented in the section on behaviour. The CGAS is a clinician rating, giving a single summary score. As it covers a wide age range, the descriptions for each band of 10 scores do not necessarily apply to children up to the age of 6 years.Evidence of its measurement properties in ASD is lacking. Physical skills, Social communication and Social functioning are presented under other headings. Play For details, see Table 32 . The ToPP is a direct assessment of a child 's symbolic play skills; the clinician sets up scenes with materials and observes the child 's actions. It was used in two observational studies in this review. The evidence on measurement properties when used with children with ASD is weak, with no information on reliability.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

The CBCL has forms for children aged 1.5 -5 years and 6 -18 years, and this linkage across ages is a strength of the tool for longitudinal studies. The items can be scored on psychiatric scales, although this may not be as relevant for children with ASD up to the age of 6 years. It was used in three observationalstudies and three intervention evaluation studies in this review. Information on measurement properties is lacking in terms of reliability and sensitivity to change. The participants at the Discussion Day liked the clear instructions, with a time frame of 2 months, and the wide range of questions, including a qualitativesection at the end enquiring about the best things about the child. The three-point scale may not provide sufficient range to capture change. The participants noted that the short questions do not establish the underlying reasons why a child might show the behaviours. The following four behaviour scales have all been developed for individuals with disabilities. The ABC only just overlaps with our target age group, and the content clearly derives from work with older individuals with intellectual impairments. It was used in four observational studies in our review, with children as young as 3 years. There is reasonably strong evidence for its measurement properties in children with ASD. The BISCUIT-Part 3 is, by contrast, a short scale focused on infants up to 37 months of age. It was used in one observational study in our review, and the evidence for its structural validity was not strong. The HSQ-PDD version is relatively new, and was used in one intervention evaluation study in our review. It originates from the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network. The evidence forits measurement properties is strong, including responsiveness to change. The NCBRF starts with 10 positive social items, before the 66 problem items. Parents are also invited to mention special circumstances that may have affected the child' s behaviour in the last month. Participants at the Discussion Day particularly appreciated that the items included some which were relevant to ASD. However, participants thought some items were poorly worded (e.g. 'resisted provocation '), several were not relevant to children in the age range up to 6 years (including items such as 'feels worthless or inferior ') and some items would be typical for a 3-year-old (e.g. 'runs away from adults '). The evidence on measurement properties was mixed. This tool was used in one intervention evaluation study in the review. Global measure of functioning For details, see Table 34 . The BASC-2 was not developed for the assessment of individuals with disabilities. It was used in one observational study in the review. The evidence on measurement properties was restricted to discriminatingbetween groups. Similarly the SIB-R is for the general population (birth to old age). It was used in one intervention evaluation study in this review. The evidence on measurement properties in children with ASD is limited. The PEP-R and PEP-3 were specifically developed for assessment of children with autism. With an emphasis on identifying learning strengths, uneven development and emerging abilities, they are primarily intended to be useful in educational programming. They were used in four intervention evaluation studies and five observational studies in this review. The evidence on measurement properties (for the PEP-R) wasreasonably strong.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk102The VABS are very widely used in ASD research and clinical practice, and cover birth to 90 years of age. In this review it was used in 67 studies, 24 of which were intervention evaluation. However, evidence from studies specifically on measurement properties in use with children with ASD was limited. Further evidenceon the VABS Screener, developed for research purposes, would be useful though the reduced number of items might well restrict responsiveness to change. Parent stress For details, see Table 35 . The APSI lists 13 problem behaviours or areas of concern, and asks about the degree of stress created. Parents in the MeASURe advisory groups, and at the Discussion Day, considered that many of thebehaviours listed would not cause stress, and, conversely, that important areas which do cause stress, such as dealing with service providers or taking the child out into the community, were not covered. Therefore, the scale might capture change only in specific areas after intervention. The APSI was used inone intervention evaluation study in the review, by the authors. More evidence is required about itsmeasurement properties. The PSI has a long history and was designed to assess the level of difficulties experienced by parents of children with behavioural and emotional problems, in particular those parents who are at risk of dysfunctional parenting. The one-page Short Form has a mixture of questions about the child and about parent feelings. Participants at the Discussion Day found the questions very negatively worded andwondered whether parents would be wary of being judged. They commented that aspects such as resilience, and having a support network, were important and not included. The PSI was used in eight intervention evaluation studies and three observational studies in the review. Evidence for its measurementproperties in use with parents of children with ASD is relatively strong. The QRS-F has wide use in the field of child disability. Parents at the advisory group meetings found it negative in wording and were uncomfortable with the yes/no scoring format. They considered this wouldalso limit measurement of change. The QRS-F had been used in four intervention evaluation studies and three observational studies in the review. Evidence on measurement properties when used with parents of children with ASD was limited.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

We will briefly consider some tools that may hold promise in future reviews, and also discuss some approaches to outcome measurement and monitoring of progress, which are overlooked by the systematic review process adopted in MeASURe. Subdomains for which tools are lacking In the Social awareness subdomain, evidence on measurement properties with children on the autismspectrum was limited. This is an example of when tools are likely to have been developed first withtypically developing children. Examples include the ESCS 270and the CSBS-DP.125In the recent review of social communication scales for use in medication trials in ASD,238both of these scales were rated 'appropriate with conditions 'on the basis of evidence of reliability and of apparent sensitivity to change in ASD intervention studies. Nevertheless, both tools have ceiling effects, as they are appropriate up to ages equivalent to 30 months and 24 months, respectively, and both tools require detailed training and time for rating. Thus, the strategies adopted in the MeASURe review have not necessarily been overly exclusive. A second subdomain to be discussed further is that of Habit Problems. Only two tools had been used in longitudinal or intervention studies in this review: subscales of the CBCL and the SSC. In addition, one study271had used sleep diaries. In the process of searching for papers on measurement properties of tools identified in Chapter 3 , some new tools were found for which the paper had included tools searched for by name in establishing convergent validity (see Appendix 9 ). For example, the Children 's Sleep Habits Questionnaire272is designed for children aged 4 -12 years, and has been reviewed by Majnemer29for use with children with developmental disabilities. The Family Inventory of Sleep Habits for children with ASD273 focuses on the particular problems of sleep anxiety and bedtime resistance. The Brief Autism MealtimeBehavior Inventory 274is a tool recently developed specifically to assess eating problems in children with ASD. Thus future reviews should provide additional evidence regarding measurement tools in ASD for this important subdomain. Domains of Participation and Family Measures are particularly under-represented in this review of tools. Although several Family tools had been used in studies in Chapter 3 , no examination of their measurement properties in studies with children with ASD has been identified. This is a clear research gap. Similarly itwould be desirable to have further exploration in ASD of tools related to social inclusion, such as theSchool Liking and Avoidance Questionnaire, 275which can be teacher rated or self-reported by children as young as 3 years.276 Other approaches to measurement The search for papers on measurement properties of tools has the effect of missing some approachesthat have a legitimate place in monitoring the progress of young children with ASD. As mentioned inChapter 4 , the tool used most often in nurseries in UK is the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile. A number of other curriculum-based tools had been used in observational studies in the review. Such toolshave the benefit of being closely related to programme planning for individual children. However,criterion-referenced assessment approaches are not usually examined in research for their measurementproperties such as reliability and validity. Other approaches that individualise assessment for children include 'Target Behaviours 'and Goal Attainment Scaling. With the individuality of needs of young children with ASD, it may be particularly appropriate to adopt an idiographic approach to outcome measurement. Yet for the purposes of research, the ability to compare across individuals is required. A Target Behaviours (or target symptoms)methodology was included in the battery of tools recommended by the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology 277and used by one study278in this review. When a specific behaviour is the target of intervention, the parent is interviewed about its nature, frequency and intensity, and a vignette descriptionEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk112is prepared. At follow-up, the same questions are asked about the behaviour; the two vignettes are then compared and rated for degree of change on a nine-point scale by an expert panel. Thus this idiographic measure allows for 'blind' rating, and provides an opportunity to capture change. Inter-rater reliability across the expert panel can be assessed. Goal Attainment Scaling requires greater professional input (than Target Behaviours), including training and practice, to enable a suitable behavioural goal to be defined and scaled (with description of outcomes on a five-point scale between 'worst expected outcome 'to 'best expected outcome '). There are continuing debates about appropriate statistical analyses of Goal Attainment Scaling scores, such as whether accomplishment of different individual goals can be summed into a group score. Nevertheless, if the Goal Attainment Scaling scores are done by observation, the assessor can be 'blind' .279These approaches to responsive measurement of relevant and individualised outcomes merit further exploration for young children with ASD. In future, there will be a need to examine the measurement properties of biophysical tools, such as actigraphy and sleep recordings, i.e. of particular relevance to certain types of intervention, which have the apparent benefit of objectivity in measurement. Finally, the review has not identified and evaluated tools used in economic analyses. Very little research has investigated the measurement of preference-based health-related quality-of-life outcomes in children with ASD.280Tools that have been examined for children with ASD include the Health Utilities Index Mark 3280 and for parents the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions three-level version.281These studies indicate promising findings on the measurement properties of the tools, but further research is required to establishwhether they are appropriate for use in studies of children with ASD and how they may contribute to the evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of therapies and services. How to choose a robust outcome tool For a researcher wishing to choose a robust outcome tool, there are a series of complex decisions to negotiate. First there is the issue of what should be the primary goal of intervention -a focus on reducing particular ASD impairments or overall severity, improving child functional outcomes or quality of life forchild and/or family? Each of these goals implies different conceptual and practical considerations, and different targeted outcomes reflecting the competing priorities. The second area for consideration has to do with external validity. The dilemma here is that subjective (particularly family reported) measures arethose with the greatest external validity, as it is the experience of children and families that interventions most want to improve; however, such ratings are prone to expectation and placebo effects within interventions and such evidence is downgraded in systematic review criteria (such as Grading ofRecommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation, and The Cochrane Collaboration). A final challenge concerns ideal measurement properties. The researcher would wish to identify outcome tools that are responsive to change and also appropriate across the different settings that children experience.Aggregated measures (e.g. combining parent and teacher report with direct observation of language skills) might increase stability and reduce correlated measurement error but are controversial. Responsiveness in tools may be limited in studies involving heterogeneous samples of children by floor and ceiling effects('floor effects 'when children have limited capacity to change; 'ceiling effects 'when they have already mastered the skill). Furthermore, the review of measurement properties of tools in Chapter 4 provided little evidence about measurement error or responsiveness to change. For a clinician or educator wishing to monitor the progress of a child with ASD over time, in a nursery or other setting, there are other challenges. The tool has to have good face validity, making sense to all of those who will report on children' s behaviours, and a high level of test -retest reliability so that clear judgements can be made about whether or not observed change really represents progress. It would ideally include the whole range of outcomes (strengths and difficulties) considered important by parents and staff involved with the child, and yet not take hours to complete.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

This is not necessarily a strength, where the models of understanding autism or child development which informed their development has changed. For all tools identified, thereare areas of evidence lacking about their measurement properties. There are also many areas, identified as important by parents of children with autism, and by practitioners and researchers, for which tools are lacking. Chapter 5 outlines recommendations for further research. Thus, the following listing ( Table 36 ) is not a battery of the 'best 'tools; it is a summary of those 12 tools -identified through the MeASURe review process -that have more points in their favour than others. For inclusion in the table, the tools had positive evidence for three or more measurementproperties, derived from more than one paper about its use with young children with ASD (see Chapter 4 ). When there was more than one similar tool within a subdomain meeting these criteria, the stronger wasselected (e.g. the HSQ-PDD rather than the ABC, both tools measuring behaviour and developed inatypical populations). The level of burden (i.e. time, training, cost required) (see for example Lecavalier et al. 239) is not considered in this summary, as its relevance will vary across the circumstances and purposes of bothresearch and clinical practice; furthermore, direct assessment tools are the most expensive in time for training,but are those for which the assessor can be 'blind '.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk114TABLE 36 Summary of qualities of tools Tool name (subdomains) InterventionaBlindingbStakeholder viewAgerange cSpreadd Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Symptom severity, Restricted/repetitive behaviour,Social communication, Social functioning)++ + + + Baby and Infant Screen for Children with aUtIsm Traits-Part 2 (Emotional regulation)-- NK -- Behavioral Summarized Evaluation-Revised(Symptom severity, Global measure of outcome)- + NK + - Child Behavior Checklist (Attention, Emotional regulation, Behaviour, Habit problems)+ - ++ + Childhood Autism Rating Scale(Symptom severity)+ ++ MacArthur -Bates Communicative Development Inventory (Language)+ - NK - + Parenting Stress Index (Parent stress)+ -- ++ Pervasive Developmental Disorders Behavior Inventory (Global measure of outcome)+ -- ++ Preschool Imitation and Praxis Scale(Social ++ Responsiveness +, Yes; -, no; ?, unsure; NK, not known or not included in consultations (see Chapter 5 ). a Was used in intervention studies in the review (see Chapter 3 ). b Where parent knows the group allocation in a trial.c Can be used across the 'up to 6 years 'age range. d Study in the review from more than one research group.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

This combination of procedures goes beyond the approaches used by other teams and individuals making recommendations of tools to use in measuring outcome in ASD. 27,234 -236,238 -240 Reflections on consultation The MeASURe project greatly benefited throughout from the involvement of parent advisory groups andindividuals on the autism spectrum. To our knowledge, similar projects examining tools for outcome measurement in ASD have not included such investment in efforts for consultation and joint working withkey stakeholders. Other stakeholders (health and education professionals, other researchers in ASD) were surveyed and involved in the Discussion Day. As mentioned at the end of Chapter 2 , the predominant focus of assessment tools on 'difficulties 'rather than 'strengths 'potentially misses some important features that would allow measurement of children 's progress in acquisition of skills and capacity to adjust to their own profile of abilities, as well as key features for planning interventions. The tasks undertaken at the Discussion Day were illuminating: severalprofessionals commented on the experience of focusing on up to six questionnaires one after another, with about 10 minutes for each one. They felt pressured and found their mood sinking after reading so many negative descriptions of child behaviour or parent stress. Further, the professionals reflected on whatthey may regularly expect parents to undertake during research projects or in clinical assessments, not realising the emotional challenge that such assessments involve. As one young adult on the autism spectrum involved in the MeASURe project commented further in an e-mail: It occurred to me quite strongly that, while we tend to think of 'assessment 'as being essentially a descriptive, documentary process, it is to an extent also transformative . . . This led me to think aboutthe ethical considerations regarding the use of assessment for research, because unlike in a clinical,intervention-based environment, the aspect of reciprocity and 'what 's in it for the parents/child 'may not be quite so clear . . . I wonder whether it is considered and discussed with parents whether theyconsent to the possible transformative impact of taking part in assessments which . . . can besuggested to represent a pejorative deficit model of autism. This quote reminds professionals and researchers of the essential requirement to involve parents of youngchildren with ASD in a meaningful partnership, with full discussion of what participation in an assessment involves (benefits as well as pressures), what it can convey and how it may be used. Attention should be paid to sharing the findings of assessment in an accessible format. These are important principles to befollowed by health and education professionals, and by researchers.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Nowadays, many individuals may prefer to complete questionnaires online rather than on paper, allowing much greater inclusion of visual enhancements. Most tools do not have electronic versions and have not been validated for this mode of administration. Other considerations about the process of direct clinical assessments werecontributed by young people on the autism spectrum. These included the need for professionals to taketime to get to know the child before assessment and to make sure that practical arrangements allow the child to take part to their best capacity. Valued outcomes not represented The dissonance between attention to the behaviours considered in the diagnostic process in autism, andthe lack of focus on valued outcomes, was very evident in the MeASURe project as touched on above and in Chapter 2 . The tools that were developed primarily to aid assessment and diagnosis have influenced also what we have called 'global measures of outcome ', i.e. they include lists of symptoms that may or may not be amenable to change, and which may or may not be related to the focus of intervention. The emphasis may arise from the orientation of some research teams whose primary aim is to 'cure autism '. Some parents may indeed share such an aim, especially early on, around the time of the child' s diagnosis. In contrast, parents and young people on the autism spectrum consulted in the MeASURe project focusedon living with autism in daily life, on reducing stress and building up skills, and on enabling environments to be more 'autism friendly 'and thus promote participation. Bringing these different perspectives -and valued outcomes -together would be likely to benefit children with ASD and their families, and is consistent with the recommendations of the Kennedy Report. 16Some of the additional and relevant outcomes that were considered important to measure would thus include social interaction skills (e.g. withbrothers, sisters and other children) and everyday adaptive skills, recognition of co-occurring problems (e.g. sleep, eating), well-being of the child and family quality of life. The review has revealed the paucity of tools with known measurement properties in these areas. Limitations The aim of the MeASURe project was to identify robust tools that might be recommended for use with children with ASD up to the age of 6 years, and the procedures were designed to that end. Because of this, the chosen procedures led to some limitations of the evidence. By searching for studies which hadincluded a sample of children with ASD (or at least consideration of autism characteristics in children with neurodevelopmental disorders) we did not assess and report the measurement properties of tools when used with other samples; very many tools are first developed with samples of typically developing children.Therefore, we are not representing the full spread of information about the quality of some of the tools considered when used for other purposes. The process adopted also disadvantages recently developed tools, for which evidence of their measurement properties will accumulate in the future. The review did not include papers about the translation of a tool into a language other than English, except where the paper did then focus on assessment of measurement properties of the tool. Language and cultural issues can affect how tools perform. 282Therefore, the review does not provide information on how robust a tool may be if translated for use in the UK with a child whose home language is not English. The review has not commented on how appropriate some North American tools may be (or the changes which may be required) for use in the UK. As mentioned in Chapter 5 , there are important types of measurement (e.g. curriculum based, idiographic) which are also not represented in the review because of the chosen procedures.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk118Outcomes of MeASURe The detailed systematic reviews and consultation processes led to production of a conceptual framework for the measurement of outcomes in studies of children with ASD up to approximately 6 years of age (see Chapter 2 ). We expect this framework to be of use to researchers in the field of autism, and also to practitioners when considering how to monitor the richness of potential effects of their interventions. The fifth aim of the MeASURe project was to propose a potential battery of robust tools and outcome measures for use in research and clinical practice. It would be particularly desirable to have such a battery used across intervention studies, to enable meta-analysis. However, in the course of the project, theunbalanced nature of the evidence has meant that we have decided to list only the 12 tools with more than a minimum of positive evidence about their measurement properties (see Chapter 5 ). This represents the current state of evidence but given the limitations, and the scope and overlap of the tools, the list cannot constitute a 'recommended battery '. Nevertheless, it gives guidance on some tools for which further study of measurement properties, and re-evaluation of presentation, would repay effort. The limitations of what we know about the tools include in most instances no evidence about responsiveness to change. The COSMIN checklist did not require that a study should compare degree of change between points in time against a 'gold standard ', which would be difficult to achieve in early autism studies when there is no such comparator; rather, it allowed for evidence to be obtained through statement of a priori directional hypotheses concerning expected change. Yet this has rarely been done to establish the measurement properties of an instrument (the development of the HSQ-PDD tool 209being an exception in the list of 12 tools). Obviously, the extent to which significant treatment effects have been found in studies using such tools as part of their evaluation could add incidental backing to the weight of positive evidence in favour of using a tool. However, given the likely effects of publication bias, and difficulties in interpretation of negative findings (whether a reflection of an ineffective intervention or of anunresponsive tool), this is not a systematic source of information. Improvement is also required in the design and procedures of studies concerning the measurement properties of tools. In particular, the limitations in the available evidence have restricted our capacity tocomment on issues such as generalisability as most studies used clinic or convenience samples, were conducted in research rather than naturalistic settings, and did not take into account appropriateness across the range of ability in children with ASD. Nevertheless, the review has provided a searchable source of evidence for researchers, and clinicians, on the qualities of many tools used with young children with ASD. Let us take a worked example. Bothparents and professionals had 'challenging behaviour 'as an important outcome in their top 10 constructs (see Chapter 2 ). What can we learn about the various possible tools? In Appendix 5 , we can see that 12 different approaches to the measurement of behaviour problems were found, with information aboutthe samples of children participating in those studies, the subscales used and the outcomes measured according to the study authors. Then in Chapter 4 , we can inspect Table 19 regarding Behaviour problems, where the evidence about papers reporting the measurement properties of tools is summarised. Here we find that evidence was found about only six of those tools in use with children with ASD. The detail of thefindings from the individual papers can be viewed in Appendix 8 . Let us say that a researcher is particularly concerned to choose a tool with positive evidence concerning structural validity in ASD. This reviewsuggests three choices: the ABC, the CBCL and the HSQ-PDD. By inspection of Table 33 inChapter 5 , the researcher learns that the ABC was not designed for the younger end of the age range, despite having been used in studies with children with ASD as young as 3 years. The HSQ-PDD is not yet freely available, therefore the researcher might choose the CBCL 1.5 -5 years, reassured that stakeholders at the Discussion Day were generally positive about the scale.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

For this reason, many recent early intervention studies have focused on enhancing these skills in the context of reciprocity between a child and familiar adult (parent or teacher).285,286What model of outcome measurement might be appropriate for a short-term intervention focusing on joint attention and imitation? Proximal measures will include direct observation and coding of adult -child interaction (see for example Kasari et al.287and Kaale et al.288). Focused measurement of joint engagement and joint attention may lend itself to standardisation in future, but could not be reviewed by MeASURe as the codesare adapted from study to study (see Appendix 5 ). Is there a more formal way to measure the broader subdomain of Social awareness? In Table 3 , nine possible measures are listed; however, in Table 8 , only two have supportive evidence on their measurement properties, and the stronger is the PIPS, included inthe MeASURe list of 12 tools (see Table 36 ). The research team hypothesises that there will be a more distal intervention effect on Language; in Table 3 , 17 measures are listed, including parent report of vocabulary and direct testing. They consult Table 11 and find limited evidence for only two direct assessments in children with ASD (the MSEL and the PLS-4). This then requires a pragmatic decision aboutwhich to choose. Parent report of vocabulary (MCDI) has greater support, and is also included in theMeASURe list of 12 tools (see Table 36 ). The research team expects to find a broader effect on social communication; eight tools are listed in Table 3 but only three have supportive evidence in Table 16 . The ADI-R is a diagnostic interview, and so not suitable for short-term outcome measurement. The ADOShas strong properties (see Table 24 ) and the inclusion of the Toddler Module in ADOS-2 allows very young children to be assessed. However, it is again primarily a diagnostic tool and evidence on responsivenessto change is lacking. The Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC), which originatedas a development from the ADOS, may be an option in future having been developed explicitly for this purpose, allowing assessment blind to trial allocation (see Chapter 5 ). The SRS (see Table 36 ) would, in principle, allow parents to report on their children 's skills and difficulties, but the total score covers multiple components, and, again, this tool lacks evidence on responsiveness to change ( Table 6 ). Thus the MeASURe review allows a research team to make an informed though difficult choice of tools to address their model of outcome measurement. Conclusions A number of research gaps and suggestions have been highlighted in this report. In order for a battery of robust tools and outcome measures for use with young children with ASD to become a reality, the following points would need to be taken into consideration: 1. Prior to development of new tools it would be helpful for researchers to consult approaches to evaluation of the properties of tools, such as the freely available COSMIN approach (www.cosmin.nl)or the resources provided by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Group at the University of Oxford (http://phi.uhce.ox.ac.uk/home.php). This would guide the design of the development studies so that all important properties are considered. 2. Critically, stakeholders and especially parents and individuals on the autism spectrum should be included from the start of development of new tools, to discuss the purpose of the tool, its content and presentation, and the likely impact on children and parents of the tool in use. The NIHR INVOLVE (www.involve.org.uk) provides a range of resources to advise on working in partnership withservice users. 3. Tools should be developed and validated particularly in areas such as quality of life (child well-being) and participation in life situations (such as social inclusion) that were highly valued by parents andpeople with ASD. Consideration should be given to the content of tools, so that direct assessments are attractive to young children, and questionnaires include positively worded items and strengths as well as difficulties.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk1204. However, there are already multiple tools available and more being developed. More is not necessarily better. There were 75 tools for which no evidence was discovered for Chapter 4 . Some of these tools could be suitable for further evaluation of their measurement properties with children with ASD, as an alternative to producing brand new tools measuring the same domain. Such studies should examine face and content validity, with input from parents of young children with ASD. The study design should evaluate measurement invariance across the range of abilities in ASD and across settings. 5. The list of 44 new tools found during the Chapter 4 searches (see Appendix 9 ) have already been used with children with ASD, and so may also be examined further with reference to their measurement properties. 6. One urgent research priority is to establish a robust tool that can be measured 'blind' , which captures social communication skills and is suitable across the age and ability range in children with ASD upto the age of 6 years. The BOSCC may prove to be such a tool, as mentioned in Chapter 5 . 7. Measurement of RRBs is more problematic, as valid approaches to direct observation are essentially not possible after the first 1 or 2 years of life. A tool such as the ADOS does measure RRBs but onlywithin a structured play setting, which may not elicit the behaviours that are characteristic of an individual child. Only one parent questionnaire had sufficient evidence about measurement propertiesto be included (see Table 9 ), so more development work is required on the most appropriate RRB measurement tools, which can be used across settings (such as home and nursery). 8. Questionnaire approaches to global measure of outcome have usually been hampered by covering a wide age and ability range (thus including items inappropriate for a young child) and focusing on(negatively worded) symptoms rather than skills. A new approach is needed, developed in partnership with parents and with individuals on the autism spectrum, to attempt to generate a useful and meaningful global measure of outcome and response to intervention for young children with ASD. 9. In addition to measurement of core ASD characteristics, the MeASURe project has highlighted the importance of also measuring children 's functioning in everyday life. The VABS are the most extensively used tool for global measure of function, with surprisingly little evidence available abouttheir measurement properties in use with young children with ASD. We therefore recommend that such studies be undertaken. 10. The MeASURe project did not include all of the procedures required to establish agreement on a core outcome set for young children with autism. The COMET Network suggests various procedures (www.comet-initiative.org/resources/coreresourcepack), which enable consensus to be reached, including rounds of consultation through Delphi surveys. Using levels of agreement on which suggested outcomes are deemed 'essential ', with feedback to consultees at each round and a final consensus meeting of stakeholders, it is possible to refine a large number of possible outcomes into a core listing. Given the foundation established in the MeASURe project, these further procedures could be followed, ideally in conjunction with international partners, in order to create a consensus core outcome set.DOI: 10.3310/hta19410 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2015 VOL. 19 NO. 41 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

Development of a tool to measure child quality of life, with careful attention to content validation for children with ASD. 2. Assessment of the measurement properties of a newly developed tool, the BOSCC, by research group(s) in the UK, as a potential primary outcome for early intervention trials focused on improving social communication in young children with ASD. 3. Assessment of the measurement properties of tools developed for children with ASD up to the age of 6 years, which focus on problems such as anxiety and sleep. 4. Further studies of the measurement properties of the VABS in young children with ASD.5. Assessment of the measurement properties of the UK Early Years Foundation Stage Profile for use with young children with ASD. 6.

Topics for research are identified and prioritised to meet the needs of the NHS. He alth technology assessment forms a substantial portfolio of work within the National Institute for Health Research and each year about fifty new studies are commissioned to help answer questions of direct impo rtance to the NHS. The studies include both primary research and evidence synthesis. Question What is the validity of tools and outcome measures used in measuring and monitoring autism spectrum disorder (ASD); and how well do these reflect and measure issues of importance for patients and carers? 1 Technology : Tools for measuring and monitoring aspects of autism (excluding diagnosis). 2 Patient group: Children with autism spectrum disorder up to about 6 years old. 3 Setting: Any appropriate setting. 4 Control or comparator treatment: n/a 5 Design: A systematic review of qualitative and quantitative tools and outcome measures used in the assessment and monitoring of children with ASD. The validity of the tools and their sensitivity to change should be assessed, as well as their importance to carers. These findings should inform a discussion about the appropriate choice of tools and identify those elements that appear to be most robust and could best inform the future development of a suite of tools for use in research into the effectiveness of interventions for ASD but potentially also for use in clinical practice. 6 Important outcomes: Findings of the systematic revi ews, suitability of tools for use in monitoring patients, and research recommendations. Information for potential applicants: Autistic spectrum disorder encompasses a wide variety of behavioural and communicative problems. In the UK there are over half a million people with autism - around 1 in 100 people. Yet, it often remains unrecognised and undiagnosed until or after late preschool age. The initial presentation can be to a wide range of professionals in primary care, education or social services. ASD-specific diagnostic instruments may be used to supplement the process of clinical observation, as part of the diagnostic assessment. A wide number of different rating instruments have been developed and some have not been validated. . It would be desirable to have a suite of validated tools with standardised outcome measures for use in clinical practice in the NHS as well as for use in research.

With this version it is possible to calculate overall methodological quality scores per study on a measurement property. A methodological quality score per box is obtained by taki ng the lowest rating of any item in a box ('worse score counts'). For example, if for a reliability study one item in the box 'Reliability' is scored poor, the methodolo gical quality of that reliability study is rated as poor. The Interpretability box and the Generalizability box are mainly used as data extraction forms. We recommend to use the I nterpretability box to extract all information on the interpretability issues described in this box (e.g. norm scores, floor-ceiling effects, minimal important change) of the instruments under study from the included articles. Similar, we recommend to use the Generalizability box to extract data on the characteristics of the study population and sampling procedure. Therefore no scoring system was developed for these boxes. This scoring system is described in this paper: Rating the methodological quality in systematic reviews of studies on measurement properties: a scoring system for the COSMIN checklist.

Determining if the statistical method used in the article are based on CTT or IRT Box General requirements for studies that applied Item Response Theory (IRT) models excellent good fair poor 1 Was the IRT model used adequately described? e.g. One Parameter Logistic Model (OPLM), Partial Credit Model (PCM), Graded Response Model (GRM) IRT model adequately described IRT model not adequately described 2 Was the computer software package used adequately described? e.g. RUMM2020, WINSTEPS, OPLM, MULTILOG, PARSCALE, BILOG, NLMIXED Software package adequately described Software package not adequately described 3 Was the method of estimation used adequately described? e.g. conditional maximum likelihood (CML), marginal maximum likelihood (MML) Method of estimation adequately described Method of estimation not adequately described 4 Were the assumptions for estimating parameters of the IRT model checked? e.g. unidimensionality, local independence, and item fit (e.g. differential item functioning (DIF)) assumptions of the IRT model checked assumptions of the IRT model partly checked assumptions of the IRT model not checked or unknown To obtain a total score for the methodological quality of studies that use IRT methods, the 'worse score counts' algorithm shou ld be applied to the IRT box in combination with the box of the measurement property that was evaluated in the IRT study. For example, if IRT methods are used to study internal consistency and item 4 in the IRT box is scored fair, while the items in the internal consistency box (box A) are all scored as good or excellent, the methodological quality score for internal consistency will be fair. However, if any of the items in box A is scored poor, the m ethodological quality score for internal consistency will be poor.APPENDIX 7 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk456Step 3.
