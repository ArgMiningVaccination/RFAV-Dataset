How Toxaprevent works to detox heavy metals from the body Heavy metals have been proven to be a significant threat, and several health risks are associated. The toxic effects of these metals are harmful to the human body and its functioning. Toxaprevent contains Zeolite Clinoptilolite MANC particles, which bind to and detox heavy metals from your body. Toxaprevent Medi Plus Sachets target the upper digestive tract, mouth, oesophagus, and stomach. It binds and detoxes the heavy metals as we sleep. Our bodies naturally detox and put toxins such as heavy metals into circulation as we sleep, which are meant to be removed when we pass stool and urine. However, these toxins can be reabsorbed by the digestive tract, returning them to circulation. Taking the Toxaprevent Medi Plus sachets at night ensures that these heavy metals are bound by the MANC particles, which then detox and relieve the symptoms associated with heavy metal toxin accumulation. Toxaprevent Medi Pure Capsules target the lower digestive tract, intestines, and colon. The capsules detox the heavy metals that are released by the pancreas. The pancreas, alongside the liver produces bile which aids in digestion. The bile contains heavy metals which are normally reabsorbed by the intestines and colon. However, the Toxaprevent Medi Pure Capsules bind and detox the heavy metals that are put into circulation and remove them safely from the body when we pass our natural bowel movement. "}
