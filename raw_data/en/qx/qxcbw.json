It is caused by the influenza virus, which can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or nasal secretions. Other illnesses can have the same symptoms and are often mistaken for influenza. But only an illness caused by theinfluenza virus is really influenza. Anyone can get influenza, but rates of infection are highest among children. For most people, it lasts only a few days.It can cause: \u00b7 fever \u00b7 sore throat \u00b7 chills \u00b7 fatigue \u00b7 cough \u00b7 headache \u00b7 muscle aches Some people get much sicker. Influenza can lead to pneumonia and can be dangerous for people with heart orbreathing conditions. It can cause high fever, diarrhea andseizures in children. On average, 226,000 people arehospitalized every year because of influenza and 36,000 die -mostly elderly. Influenza vaccine can prevent influenza. There are two types of influenza vaccine: 1. Inactivated (killed) vaccine, or the \"flu shot\" is given by injection into the muscle. 2. Live, attenuated (weakened) influenza vaccine is sprayed into the nostrils. This vaccine is described in a separate Vaccine Information Statement.Influenza viruses are always changing. B ecause of this, influenza vaccines are updated every year, and an annual vaccination is recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause flu that year. When there is a closematch the vaccine protects most people from serious influenza- related illness. But even when there is not a close match, the vaccine provides some protection. Influenza vaccine will not prevent \"influenza-like\" illnesses caused by other viruses. It takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the shot. Protection lasts up to a year. Some inactivated influenza vaccine contains a preservativecalled thimerosal. Some people have suggested thatthimerosal may be related to developmental problems inchildren. In 2004 the Institute of Medicine reviewed manystudies looking into this theory and concluded that there isno evidence of such a relationship. Thimerosal-free influenzavaccine is available.Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis. 2008-09 1Why get vaccinated?3Who should get inactivated influenza vaccine? All children 6 months and older and all older adults: \u0081All children from 6 months through 18 years of age. \u0081 Anyone 50 years of age or older . Anyone who is at risk of complications from influenza , or more likely to require medical care: \u0081 Women who will be pregnant during influenza season. \u0081 Anyone with long-term health problems with: - heart disease - kidney disease - liver disease - lung disease - metabolic disease, such as diabetes- asthma - anemia, and other blood disorders \u0081 Anyone with a weakened immune system due to: - HIV/AIDS or other diseases affecting the immune system- long-term treatment with drugs such as steroids- cancer treatment with x-rays or drugs \u0081 Anyone with certain muscle or nerve disorders (such as seizure disorders or cerebral palsy) that can lead to breathing or swallowing problems. \u0081 Anyone 6 months through 18 years of age on long-term aspirin treatment (they could develop Reye Syndrome if they got influenza). \u0081Residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities. Anyone who lives with or cares for people at high risk forinfluenza-related complications: \u0081Health care providers. \u0081Household contacts and caregivers of children from birth up to 5 years of age. \u0081Household contacts and caregivers of - people 50 years and older, or- anyone with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Health care providers may also recommend a yearly influenzavaccination for: \u0081 People who provide essential community services. \u0081 People living in dormitories, correctional facilities, or under other crowded conditions, to prevent outbreaks. \u0081 People at high risk of influenza complications who travel to the Southern hemisphere between April and September, or to the tropics or in organized tourist groups at any time. Influenza vaccine is also recommended for anyone who wantsto reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza or spreading influenza to others.5Some people should talk with a doctor before getting influenzavaccine 6What are the risks from inactivated influenza vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of avaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Serious problems from influenza vaccine are very rare. The viruses in inactivated influenza vaccine have been killed, so you cannot get influenza from the vaccine. Mild problems: \u0081 soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given\u0081 fever \u0081 achesIf these problems occur, they usually begin soon after theshot and last 1-2 days.Severe problems:\u0081 Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. \u0081 In 1976, a type of influenza (swine flu) vaccine was associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). Since then, flu vaccines have not been clearly linked to GBS. However, if there is a risk of GBS from current fluvaccines, it would be no more than 1 or 2 cases per millionpeople vaccinated. This is much lower than the risk of severe influenza, which can be prevented by vaccination. 9How can I learn more? \u0081 Ask your immunization provider. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. \u0081 Call your local or state health department.\u0081 Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) for Disease and Prevention 7What if there is a severe reaction?4When should I get influenza vaccine? Vaccine Information Statement Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (7/24/08) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300aa-26 Some people should not get inactivated influenza vaccine or should wait before getting it. \u0081 T ell your doctor if you have any severe (life-threatening) allergies. Allergic reactions to influenza vaccine are rare. - Influenza vaccine virus is grown in eggs. People with a severe egg allergy should not get the vaccine. - A severe allergy to any vaccine component is also a reason to not get the vaccine. - If you have had a severe reaction after a previous dose of influenza vaccine, tell your doctor. \u0081 T ell your doctor if you ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS). Y ou may be able to get the vaccine, but your doctor should help you make the decision. \u0081 People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting flu vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your doctor or nurse about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine .What should I look for? \u0081 Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can includedifficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives,paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? \u0081Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. \u0081T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. \u0081Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice. 8The National Vaccine Injury Compensation ProgramPlan to get influenza vaccine in October or November if you can. But getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will stillbe beneficial in most years. Y ou can get the vaccine as soon asit is available, and for as long as illness is occurring in yourcommunity. Influenza can occur any time from Novemberthrough May, but it most often peaks in January or February. Most people need one dose of influenza vaccine each year. Children younger than 9 years of age getting influenzavaccine for the first time - or who got influenza vaccine for the first time last season but got only one dose - should get 2doses, at least 4 weeks apart, to be protected. Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, including pneumococcal vaccine. A federal program exists to help pay for the care of anyone who has a serious reaction to a vaccine.
