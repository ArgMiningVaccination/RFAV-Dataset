Over the past 50 years the use of vaccines has prevented life threatening disease, disability, certain cancers and hospitalizations. Immunization provided to the population provides herd immunity, making it difficult for disease to spread from person to person. By getting immunized, you are protecting yourself and those around you who may too young, too old or too sick to be immunized. How can my family and I get vaccines through the Immunization Program? Children, under the age of 18 years or until the child completes high school, can receive vaccines at no cost. Immunization is delivered to children by [Health PEI Public Health Nursing offices ](/en/information/health-pei/public-health-nursing)by appointment or in scheduled visits to schools. [Adults ](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/health-pei/adult-immunizations)also need vaccines at certain times. You can be immunized at your local Health PEI Public Health Nursing office, your family doctor or nurse practitioner's office or a pharmacy, depending on the vaccine. Many adult vaccines are free, however there are exceptions. Travel immunizations for adults and children are not free of charge in PEI and are not available at Health PEI Public Health Nursing offices. Islanders are encouraged to contact a travel clinic for immunization as it relates to travel. Which vaccines are recommended for my child? Vaccines are given based on the age of your child.
