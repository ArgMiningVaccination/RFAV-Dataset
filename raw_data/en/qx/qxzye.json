Fiery Pitta The fiery pitta dosha represents metabolism, digestion, and transformation according to [The Ayurveda Institute](https://www.ayurveda.com/resources/articles/doshas-their-elements-and-attributes). People with a dominant pitta have courageous, ambitious personalities with a quick wit but can also become controlling and competitive. When out of balance, this leads to excessive heat in the body and mind, like anger, acidity, fever, and rashes. You can balance pitta by going to bed earlier. Avoid working late in the day and begin resting before bed. Also, favor cooling spices like fennel, coriander, and cardamom. At the same time, avoid hot spices like ginger, chili, onion, and garlic. Pitta also needs time to be playful to feel your best. Exercise will help, but avoid getting overheated, as pitta's fiery energy already tends to feel hot. Rather than heavy cardio or hot yoga, consider walking, [tai chi](/articles/five-reasons-to-practice-qigong-today), or yoga instead.

Avoid sitting for long periods by taking breaks every 30 minutes, by walking around or stretching. A standing desk is also a great way to stay on your feet and active throughout the day. Lively Vata Made of air and ether, the vata dosha controls bodily functions associated with motion, like blood flow, breathing, heartbeat, and the movement of thoughts through the mind. Those with dominant vata often feel lively and creative, but can also become restless and anxious. If your mind races and you feel uneasy, you can balance vata by eating warm, moist foods. A few other ways to balance vata include going to bed early, ideally by 10 PM, eating [healthy fats ](/articles/all-hype-about-healthy-fats)and oils, drinking warm beverages, and preferring cooked dishes.
