The aim of thi s literature review was to provide data on the effect and safety of vaccinating preterm infants against these two diseases as a knowledge base for a recommendation on immunization of preterm infants in Norway and Sweden. Methods We conducted a rapid, systematic literature review of studies on immunogenicity, effectiveness and safety of vaccines against whooping cough and invasive pneumococcal disease in premature i nfants. Articles published between 1986 and June 2017 were included. Results Antibody levels against pertussis toxin and pertactin achieved in premature infants were similar to that of full-term infants both with the use of different aP -containing combination vaccines and various vaccination schedules . Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines used with various vaccination schedules are immunogenic in preterm infant s, and m ost preterm infants develop levels above putatively protective level for the majority of serotypes included in the vaccines. The vaccine effectiveness against whooping cough in preterm infants was found to be 45 - 71 % after the first dose and 89-90 % after the third dose recommended at 12 months of age in the two studies i ncluded. The vaccine efficacy of PCV7 against invasive pneumococcal disease with vaccine serotypes was found to be 100 % in preterm infants . Apnea/A BD events in the 48 -72 h post-vaccination period was described in 8 included studies for 0-23% of children born premat urely. There was a clear tendency of lower incidence of apnea/ABD events with higher GA at birth. There was no correlation between the chronologic age of the infants at first vaccination and the incidence of post -vaccination apnea/ABD events . Preterm infants, who have had sepsis a nd those with lung disease, had an increased risk for apnea/ABD events post -vaccination compared with preterm infants without these co -morbidities. A causal relationship between vaccination and death was not found in any study. There may be a risk for recurrent apnea after the second dose if the infants had serious apnea after the first dose . Prospective studies are needed to make any conclusions if there is an increased risk of apnea/ABD events when multiple vaccines , especially conjugated vaccines, are given concurrently. Conclusion As the benefit of vaccination is high in preterm infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed . The first dose should be given starting at approximately 8 weeks of chronological age, especially with regards to protection against whooping cough . Infants born before 30+0 weeks of gestation and infants with significant comorbidity should be monitored during the first vaccination for at least 48 h , and should preferably be vaccinated b efore discharge from the hospital. 10 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Preface Preterm infants are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases. In spite of that, vaccination of preterm infants has been a matter for discussion. Thirty years ago these infants were left unvaccinated for a longer period than term infants, and often give n reduced doses of vaccine. Even though time s have changed, there is still some hesitation regarding vaccination of vulnerable infants and for some preterm infants vaccinations are withheld or delayed. This literature review was conducted as a joint proje ct between the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the Public Health Agency of Sweden, and sums up what is known about safety and effect of vaccines against whooping cough and pneumococci in preterm infants. Hopefully the results and conclusions will add further knowledge for those caring for these infants , and make it possible to protect the preterm infants even better than we do today. Oslo, March 2018 Ingeborg S. Aaberge 11 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Introduction In high-income countries such as Norway and Sweden, whooping cough and pneumococcal disease account for the highest burden of vaccine preventable diseases in infants. The risk of infection with pertussis and pneumococci is higher in preterm than in full-term children (1- 3). Early protection induced by vaccination is highly advantageous in preterm children. Previously , premature infants were considered to have an immature immune system that would not be able to evoke an optimal immune response. Consequently vaccination was often postponed based on their gestational age as opposed to chronological age. After studies determined that post-natal maturation o f the immune system is dependent on antigen exposure and not solely on degree of prematurity , preterm infants were recommended vaccination at the same chronological age as full-term infants (4). However, inclusion o f several new vaccines in the national immunization p rogram (NIP) and the use of combination vaccines with five or six different components has again raised questions whether or not current immunization practices regarding preterm infants are safe and efficacious. Today, preterm infants are in many countries recommended vaccination with the same schedule and at the same chronological age as full-term infants. Pneumococcal and pertussis-containing vaccines are usually given in a 2+1, 3+0 or 3+1 schedule. The first vaccine dose is usually recommended at 2 months of age (5-7). However, clinical experience indicates that vaccines are often delayed for preterm infants due to the fear of adverse events. Adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), including cardiorespiratory deterioration, are of concern and can sometime s be difficult to distinguish from adverse effects due to prematurity itself. Preterm infants with a previous history of cardiorespiratory instability or with significant comorbiditie s are usually recommended to have the first vaccine dose before discharge from hospital. In the Norwegian and Swedish immunization programs, a six-valent combination vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Hib and hepatitis B) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine are commonly used for both preterm and full-term infants at 3, 5 and 12 months of age. There are no national recommendations for special vaccination programs for preterm infants in Sweden, but regional routine recommendations exist in some areas in Sweden, where an extra dose of pneumococcal and hexavalent DTaP-containing vaccines at 8 weeks of age is also recommended (8-11). Many countries, including Sweden, have recently seen a rise in pertussis incidence among infants and experienced infant deaths due to pertussis. This has led to recommendations of maternal vaccinatio n against pertussis in many high-income countries, including the USA, UK, Australia and Belgium. Norway and Sweden have both considered the necessity, effectiveness and safety regarding maternal vaccination against pertussis, and have concluded that a recommendation is not warranted for the time being (12-14). The aim of this literature r eview was to collect data on safety, immunogenicity a nd effectiveness of pneumococcal and pertussis vaccination in premature infants, in order to guide updated recommendations regarding immunization of these infants in the Norwegian and Swedish NIPs. 12 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Aims Collect and present data retrieved from a literary review on preterm infants' response after vaccination against pertussis and pneumococc al disease, compared to the response in full-term infants. The report aims to present data in three categories; Immunogenicity Are the immune responses towards pneumococcal and pertussis vaccines in preterm infants similar to that in full-term infants? Are there any significant differences in immunogenicity against pneumococcal and pertussis vaccines according to degree of prematurity? Effectiveness Are pneumococcal and pertussis vaccines effective in preventing invasive p neumococcal disease and whooping cough in preterm infants? Safety Does vaccination during the first months of life of preterm infants increase the risk of apnea? If so, oIs the increased risk correlated to gestational age ? oIs the increased risk correlated to concomitant vaccinati on with multipl e v accines? oWhat other factors are correlated with clinical deterioration after vaccination ? oH ow long after vaccination does the increased risk persist? For children with apnea a fter the first vaccination, is there an increased risk of apnea also after the second vaccination ? D oes vaccination of preterm infants during the first months of life increase the risk of death?13 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Met hod This report was based on a rapid, systematic literature review of studies published between 1986 - June 2017. We limited the vaccines of interest to acellular pertussis (aP)- containing vaccines and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (7, 10 or 13 -valent). A literature search was performed on the 2nd of June 2017 and articles were retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane Library and Scopus. The search strategy combined controlled vocabulary and free text terms and included words such as: preterm, newborn, low birth weigh t, immunogenicity, vaccine. The complete search strategy is listed in Appendix 1. Only articles in English, Dutch, French, German, Spanish and Italian were included. As a first selection, title s and abstract s were reviewed. The search results were divided among eight researchers . A ninth researcher reviewed all of the titles and abstracts of included articles. At least two persons read each abstract . The research team was divided in three sub -teams assessing a rticles in full text for immunogenicity , effectiveness and safety respectively. At least two team members assessed each full text article. Disagreements were resolved through discussions among the researchers. Articles were included according to the crite ria listed in Figure 1. Figure 1 PICO formulation P (Population) = A) Preterm (GA 23 to 36 weeks 6 days) B) Low birth weight ( 2499g) I (Intervention) = A) Pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7, PCV10, Acellular chedule 2+1 and 3+1 and 3+0 C (Comparison) = A) Full-term (GA 37 weeks) B) Normal birth weight ( 2500g) C) Historical controls O (Outcome) = A) Immunogenicity in serum - Pneumococcal IgG antibodies - Pertussis IgG antibodies B) Vaccine effectiveness (VE) up to 5 years age C) Safety: Apnea or death Articles from the literature search were excluded if they solely contained data from : Animal studies Mathematical modelling Case reports Maternal vaccination Cost benefit analyses Where relevant, the results on immunogenicity, effectiveness and safety were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) terminology . Judgement about the quality of evidence with GRADE was based on 14 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health the terminology described by the GRADE Working Group (15). GRADE evaluations are primarily based on study design, where the studies evaluated are given a number of points on a scale from one to four plus ( ). Randomized studies typically start with and the GRADE is reduced if there are problems with study quality, inconsistencies, imprecision or high probability of reporting bias. Typically such problems will reduce the number of points with one for each of the above elements. Overall qua lity of evidence was defined using the following terms: High () = Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate () = Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the e stimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low () = Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low () = Any estimate of effect is very uncertai n. The regular GRADE methodology as a rule calls for an important final step w here studies with high or moderate quality of evidence are presented together in a table according to a specific format. From this table an overall evaluation of the body of evi dence is presented. In GRADE handbooks it is often stated that articles with low or very low quality of evidence are to be presented in another, separate list, and this approach was chosen for the current review (16). We did not find any studies with high or moderate quality of evidence for effectiveness or safety using the predefined criteria mentioned above. Data on immunogenicity were assessed using geometric mean concentration (GMC) of pertussis and p neumococc al IgG antibodies in serum. Proportions of infants with pneumococcal antibody levels over a common consensus cut-off of 0.35 \u00b5g/ml were also reviewed. For pertussis, no correlate of protection has been determined and proportions over a hypothetical protective cut-off were therefore not included. Methods and assays used to analyze immunogenicity were evaluated in an attempt to optimize comparability of results from different laboratories. Vaccine effectiveness was assessed with invasive pneumococcal disease and whooping cough as endpoints. Safety was reviewed mainly based on apnea as an endpoint. Definitions of apnea were assessed for comparability between different studies. In the safety assessment, studies using wP vaccines were excluded since these vaccines are not used in Norwegian and Swedish immunization programs any more . Also, the safety profile of wP vaccines is known to be different than aP vaccines and comparison between studies with wP and aP are difficult . 15 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Result s The results of the literature review are shown in Figure 2. From the literature search , 3679 articles were retrieved after exclusion of duplicates . Following screening of t itles and abstracts, 98 articles remained. After further screening for full text and excluding those not fulfilling PICO or those with methodological issues, 25 articles were included; 1 3 articles assessing immunogenicity, 4 articles assessing effectiveness and 8 articles assessing safety. During the process, reference lists of included articles were scrutinized for possible addition al articles. Figure 2 Selection of articles Immunogenicity Comparability of laboratory methods used to evaluate immunogenicity The evaluation of vaccine responses against pertussis and pneumococcal antigens in this report is mainly based on IgG ELISA results from different laboratories. The ELISA methodology is well known, widely used, well characterized, relatively cheap and suited for dealing with large number of samples in a limited amount of time. Pertussis ELISA The ELISA method s used for pertussis, including type s of antigen and reference material, were standardized in preparation for large aP vaccine trials performed during the 1990s. Subsequently, the methods were further developed for seroepidemiological studies and for diagnostic purposes in various laboratories (17). The aP vaccines were originally licensed based on non -inferiority antibody responses against some selected putative protective antigens in licensed wP vaccines (PT, Prn, F HA and Fim 2/3 (fimbriae 2 and 3)). 16 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Various studies have attempted to find a serological correlate of protection after vaccination with aP vaccines . It has been suggested that low or undetectable levels of anti - PT correlate with risk of infection and also that anti -PT, anti-Prn and anti-Fim antibodies may be protective (18-21). It was concluded that no c orrelates of protection are generalizable to all aP vaccines. Probably, no single correlate of protection exists and antibodies to many antigens in addition to cell-mediated immunity, provide protection against symptomatic infection and reinfection (22) . Pneumococcal ELISA The ELISA method s for pneumococci, inc luding type s of antigen, reference material and analytical computer programs were standardized somewhat later than the methodology for pertussis, and have been improved so far in three different major steps (23). The first generation of pneumococcal ELISAs showed poor correlation of antibody concen - tration with the vaccine efficacy estimates against invasive disease obtained in clinical trials. This was primarily because the assay also measured unspecific antibodies to the pneumo- coccal cell wall (CPS) in ad dition to specific antibodies against capsular polysaccharides. Hence, a second generation pneumococcal ELISA was developed where test sera were preadsorbed e ither with highly specific CPS from Statens Serum Institut , or with a crude cell wall preparation chosen by Wyeth (later Pfizer) laboratories. The correlation between antibody concentrations and vaccine efficacy estimates were improved by those measures, but was still far from perfect, with significant residual u nspecificity. It was found that the specificity could be further improved by preadsorption with an \"irrelevant \" pneumococcal polysaccharide, not used in conjugate vaccines , in addition to CPS. Serotype 22F was chosen for this purpose. The third generat ion assay format was adopted at a WHO meeting in Geneva in 2000, and a detailed guidance protocol was later developed (23). Today\u00b4s WHO recommendations for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine production and control were established in 2003 and are published, with later revis ions, in the WHO Technical Report Series (24). The standa rdized reference ELISA assays are described in a WHO Training Manual (25). Two WHO reference laboratories were established; one at the Institute of Child Health in London, UK and one at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, USA (26). A common cut -off of 0.35 \u00b5 g/ml for a number of diverse pneumococcal serotypes was chosen by consensus among experts. This threshold wa s originally based on analyses of immune responses (as measured by the second generation ELISA without 22F adsorption) to PCV7 in infants and young children in pre -license efficacy studies during the 1990s. Both the vaccine producers and the regulatory age ncies stressed that this threshold did not necessarily predict protection on an individual level , and that the use of a common cut - off for all serotypes was an oversimplification. Before the adoption of standard 3rd gene ration ELISAs, WHO arranged an inte rnational meeting in Canada. The consensus after the meeting was that a conservative, robust threshold was still needed for the foreseeable future, and that both ELISA and opsonophagocytic assay ( OPA) should be performed in immunogenicity studies (26). The threshold of 0.35 \u00b5g/ml was retained. 17 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Pertussis immunogenicity -studies in preterm infants For the purpose of this review, we will in this text focus on studies where ELISA IgG results have been obtained with standardized methodology and where results have been expressed in ELISA Units per ml (EL.U/ml) calibrated against FDA standards. We have chosen to limit the data presented to two antigens (pertussis toxin (PT) and pertactin (Prn)) with documented relation to protection against pertussis, acknowledging that a proper serological correlate of protection has not been defined (27). Eight studies included data on pertussis immunogenicity in concordance with PICO (Table 1) (28-35). Anti-PT and anti-Prn GMCs after the primary series from these studies are shown in Figure 3 and 4. The studies will be mentioned in detail below. Further details regarding results on pertussis immunogenicity can be found in Table A1 and A2 in the appendix.

Figure 4 A nti-Prn GMC levels in preterm and full -term infants one month after primary series Note: Faldella and Vazques both contain 2 datapoints due to inclusion of two separate groups in each of these studies. In an Italian study by Casadei Pistilli et al, 87 preterm infants born between 26 and 37 (mean 32) weeks gestation were compared with 83 full-term infants (28). The infants received three doses of Acelluvax\u00ae, a genetically inactivated stand -alone pertussis vaccine starting at 2 -4 months chronological age and with 8 week intervals. This vaccine - candidate is no longer produced or marketed. Immunogenicity was assessed at Laboratori Biocine S.p.A, Siena, Italy. After the primary series, anti -PT and anti -Prn levels were significantly lower in preterm than full -term infants with anti-PT and anti -Prn of and 131.9 EL.U/ml for full -term infants 19 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health respectively after the primary series and the booster dose . As shown in Figure 3 and 4, this vaccine produced robust responses and PT responses seem to be higher than those seen after other aP vaccine studies in preterm infants. Faldella et al conducted an open label Italian study in the 1990s using a 2+1 schedule with a DTaP -HepB vaccine (produced by GSK) that is no longer marketed (29). Thirty four preterm infants were included and compared with 28 full -term infants . Vaccines were given at 3, 5 and 11 months of age. At first dose, the minimum preterm infant weight was 1980 g, and all children were reported to be in good medical condition. After the primary series, preterm infants with GA 32 -35 weeks had anti-PT and anti -Prn GMCs of 41.7 and 177.8 EL.U/ml, which was of full-term infants (37.1 and 182.0 EL.U/ml) . Values were also similar between these two groups after the booster dose. For infants with GA below 3 2 weeks, anti-PT and anti -Prn GMCs were significantly lowe r (anti-PT 21.9 and anti-Prn 82.3 El.U/ml) compared to full-term infants as well as preterms with higher GA, both after the primary series and booster. Slack et al have published two different studies on post primary responses in preterm UK infants vaccinated at 2, 3 and 4 months age (30, 31). In both studies, infants below 32 weeks GA were compared to full -term infants, and immunogenicity was assessed at Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (CAMR), at Porton Down in UK one month after the third dose. In the first study, the vaccine used was Infanrix -Hib\u00ae, whereas Pediace l\u00ae was used in the second study . In both studies, anti -PT and anti-Prn GMCs were similar in preterm infants compared to full -term. After the third dose, anti-PT was 21.0 and 76.8 EL.U/ml in the preterm and 86.4 EL.U/ml in the full-term groups. Anti-Prn levels were 38.8 and 82.6 EL.U/ml in the preterm and 34.1 and 86.6 EL.U/ml in full -term groups. Anti-PT levels for Infanrix- Hib and anti -Prn levels for Pediacel were lower for both preterm and full -term infants than seen in similar studies. The authors stated that a booster dose later in life would be necessary. Omenaca et al conducted a comparative study in 2000 -2001, recruiting 93 healthy preterm (mean GA 31.1 weeks) and 89 full-term infants in Spain (32, 35). Infants were vaccinated at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, with Infanrix hexa\u00ae. A booster was given at 16 -18 months of age. Immunogenicity was assessed at GSK Biologicals. After the primary series, GMCs for anti-PT and -Prn were 61.3 and in the preterm and 60.4 and 200.3 EL.U/ml in the full -term infants . The differ ences between the two groups were not statistically significant , neither after the primary series nor the booster dose . Vazquez et al conducted an open study in Argentina recruiting 161 healthy preterm infants, half of th em with a birth weight between 150 0 grams (g) and 2000 g (low birth weight (LBW)) with mean GA 32.8 weeks , and the other half with a birth weight less than 1.5 kg (very low birth weight (VLBW)) with mean GA 29.5 weeks (33). No control group was included. Infants were vaccinated with Infanrix hexa\u00ae at 2, 4 and 6 months, in addition to a booster at 18 -24 months of age. Immunogenicity was assessed at GSK Biologicals. Anti-PT and anti-Prn GMCs were slightly lower in the VLBW group compared to the LBW group after the primary series with anti-PT of 25.5 EL.U/ml and anti-Prn of 110.1 EL.U/ml in VLBW infants and -PT of 36.6 EL.U/ml and anti-Prn of 115.7 EL.U/ml in the LBW infants. After the booster dose, GMCs were again lower in VLBW infants compared to LBW infants. However, both anti -PT and anti -Prn GMCs were in the same range as seen in similar studies . Vermeulen et al published immunogenicity results after v accinating preterm infants (mean GA 28 weeks) from France and Belgium with Tetravac\u00ae at 2, 3 and 4 months of age 20 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health (34). The report principally concentrates on cellular immune responses. Immunogenicity was assessed one month after the third dose. Anti -PT was 38.0 EL.U/ml, which is comparable to levels reported in studies mentioned above. In addition to the eight studies already mentioned, five other studies were found that fulfilled the search criteria for pertussis (35-39). However, these studies either evaluated immunogenici ty using different methodology or studied longterm immunogenicity in older children born prematurely , making it d ifficult to compare the results. Overall, they did not provide any valuable additional information related to the aims of this review. Two of the additional studies ar e briefly mentioned below . Esposito et al and Omenaca et al published longterm data for preterm and full-term children at the age of 5 -6 and 3-4 years, respectively (35, 36). In Esposito et al, preterm infants below 31 weeks GA had lower GMCs for anti -FHA and anti -Prn than full -term infants. There was no difference for the older preterm infants with GA 32 -37. Both Esposito et al and Omenaca et al showed no difference in anti -PT GMCs comparing children born preterm and full -term. In summary, preterm infants have a good immune respon se following vaccination with different aP-containing combination vaccines in various immunization schedules, both after the primary series as well as after booster dose. Antibody titers are usually comparable to that full -term infants. Pneumococcal i mmu nogenicity -studies in preterm infants For comparison of immunogenicity between different studies, only studies using standardized third generation ELISA for the measurement of pneumococcal antigens were selected in order to allow comparability between laboratories and over time (23). In total, we found five studies that fulfilled our criteria (40-44) with supplementary information given in two study reports (45, 46) (Table 2). The studies will be mentioned in detail below. Anti-pneumococcal GMCs after the primary series and after booster dose from these studies are shown in Figure 5 and 6, where s erotypes 14 and 19F are omitted due to very high values . Proportions of infants w ith values above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml after the primary series are shown in Figure 7. F urther details regarding results on pneumococcal immunogenicity can be found in the appendix Table A3-A6. 21 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Table 2 Pneumococcal studies included in immunogenicity assessment Reference Study design GA in weeks (mean ) N Vaccine Schedule D'Angio 2010 (41) Prospective observational 23-32 (27.8) 244 PCV7 (Prevenar\u00ae) Primary 2 + 4 + 6 months Moss 2010 (44) Prospective controlled 23-35 (28.6) 132 PCV7 (Prevenar\u00ae) Primary 2 + 3 + 4 months 36-42 (39.7) 53 Martinon - Torres 2015 (43) Prospective controlled Below 37 (30.8) 99 PCV13 (Prevenar13\u00ae) Primary 2 + 3 + 4 months Booster 12 months Above 36+6 (39.5) 97 Kent 2016 (42) Randomized controlled 24-34 (29.6) 64 PCV13 (Prevenar13\u00ae) Primary 2 + 4 months Booster 12 months 23-34 (30) 59 Primary 2 + 3 + 4 months Booster 12 months 23-34 (30) 68 Primary 2 + 4 + 6 months Booster 12 months Omenaca 2011 (40) and GSK technical report s (45, 46) Prospecti ve controlled 27-30 41 PCV10 (Synflorix\u00ae) Primary 2 + 4 + 6 months Booster 16 -18 months 31-36 80 37 129 Figure 5 Anti -pneumococcal GMC s in pre term infants one month after primary series (ST 14 and 19F omitted due to very high values ) For explanations of reduced, accelerated and extended schedules, please see text below for Kent 2016. 22 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Figure 6 Anti -pneumococcal GMC s in pre term infants one month after booster (ST 14 and 19F omitted due to very high values ) For explanations of reduced, accelerated and extended schedules, please see text below for Kent 2016. Figure 7 Proportion of premature infants with anti -pneumococcal IgG GMC 0 .35 \u00b5g/ml 1 month after primary series The study by Omenaca et al 2011 is not shown in Figure 7 since cut -off for anti -pneumococcal IgG was set to 0.20 \u00b5g/ml. D'Angio et al evaluated immunogenicity of PCV7 in an observational study in 2004 -2006 in the USA of preterm infants below 32 weeks GA and with a birth weight between 401 and 1500 g (41). Infants were divided in two subgroups according to birthweight; 401 - 1000 g and 1001 -1500 g. PCV7 was administered at 2, 4 and 6 months age. Immunogenicity was assessed by the WHO reference laboratory in Birmingham, Alabama, USA. One month after the primary series, anti -pneumococcal IgG GMCs were above 0.35 23 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health \u00b5g/ml for all 7 vaccine serotypes. Furthermore, over 90 % of infants had anti - pneum ococcal IgG levels above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for all vaccine serotypes, except for the group of infants with the lowest weights where this level was not achieved for serotype 6B and 23F for almost 20 % of infants. Moss et al studied preterm infants under 36 weeks GA admitted to a neonatal ward and requiring respiratory support during the neonatal period (44). Full-term infants without comorbidities were used as controls. Infants were recruited in 2004 -2006. PCV7 was administered at 2, 3 and 4 months of age. Anti -pneumococcal IgG ELISAs were analyzed with an in -house third generation ELISA at Newcastle Univ ersity. One month after the primary series, both preterm and full -term infants had anti -pneumococcal IgG GMCs above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for all serotypes except 6B. Over 90 % of preterm and full -term infants obtained results over the putative protective level of 0.35 \u00b5g/ml against 3 of the 7 and 6 of the 7 serotypes respectively. The authors comment that the preterm infants recruited in this study had lower GA and more comorbidities than in similar previous studies. The 6B ELISA results for full -term infants are also markedly lower than in other comparable studies, indicating that there might be methodological problems with the method used. These two factors make it difficult to compare the results from this study wit h results from other similar studies. Healthy infants in Poland and Spain were included in an open -label, phase IV study by Martinon -Torres et al (43). Two hundred infants were recruited in 2010 -2011 and divided in two equal ly sized groups according to GA at birth; preterm < 37 weeks and full- term 37 weeks. Mean GA and wei ght at birth were 30.8 weeks and 1500 g for the preterm infants. All infants received PCV13 at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months age. Immunogenicity was asses sed at Pfizer's l aboratory one month after primary series and booster dose respectively. After both the primary series and booster dose, anti -pneumococcal IgG GMCs for both groups were above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for all 13 vaccin e serotypes. Even though GMC s were above the cut -off, the proportion of preterm infants reaching levels of anti - pneumococcal I gG > 0.35 \u00b5g/ml after the primary series was lower than for full-term infants . In particular , proportions were lower than full -term and below 90% for serotypes 3, 5, 6A, 6B and 23F. After the booster dose, > 98 % of all infants reached GMCs above 0.35 \u00b5g/m l for all vaccine serotypes, except serotype 3, without significant differences between groups. In an open -label, randomized controlled trial conducted in 2012 -2013 in UK, Kent et al randomly assigned preterm infants < 35 weeks GA to receive PCV13 at thre e different schedules; 1) vaccine at 2, 4 and 12 months (Reduced schedule) , 2) vaccines at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months (Accelerated schedule) or 3) vaccines at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months (Extended schedule) (42). Mean GA and weight at birt h were around 30 weeks and 1400 g in all groups . Immunogenicity was assessed by the WHO reference laboratory in London, UK. After the primary series, infants in the extended group generally had higher GMCs than infants in the reduced and accelerated groups . In the extended group , anti-pneumococcal IgG GMCs were above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for all vaccine serotypes. In the accelerated and reduced groups GMCs were above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for 12 of the 13 and 10 of the 13 serotypes respectively. IgG GMCs were lowest for serotyp es 3, 5 and 6B across all groups after the primary series. The prop ortion of infants achieving GMCs above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml after the primary series was above 90% for 9 of the 13 serotypes in the extended group, compared to 4 of the 13 in the reduced and accelerated groups. The serotypes that did not reach the cut-off level of 90% in the extended group were 3, 5, 6B and 23F. 24 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Immunogenicity evaluated before the booster dose showed wa ning of immunity as expected . After the booster dose at 12 months , values were significantly lower for the extended group, but all groups had GMCs well above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for all vaccine serotypes. In a study by Omenaca et al infants recruited in 2006 -2009 were immunized with PCV10 at 2, 4, 6 and 16 -18 month s of age (40). Infants were divided in three groups according to GA; 1) 30 weeks, 2) 31-36 weeks and 3) over 37 weeks. Immunogenicity was assesse d by GSK 's laboratory . The cut -off used in this study to calculate proportions was set to 0.2 \u00b5g/ml instead of 0.35 \u00b5g/ml. Even though GMCs were lower for some serotypes in the preterm groups, t he proportion of infants with anti -pneumococcal IgG GMC s above 0.2 \u00b5g/ml was above 90 % for all vaccine serotypes, without differences between the groups. GMC s from the same study were not published in the same paper , but were available in two clinical study reports (45, 46) . Anti-pneumococcal GMCs were somewhat lower in the infants with GA below 30 weeks , but all three vaccinated groups had anti -pneumococcal IgG GMCs above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for all vaccine serotypes both one month after the primary series as well as after the booster dose. Only three of the studies presented immunogenicity data based on OPA results, but complete data were not presented from any of the studies, and a meaningful comparison between preterm and full -term infants based on OPA results was not possible (40, 41, 43) . In addition to the five studies mentioned above, eight further studies fulfilled the search criteria for pneumococcal immunogenicity (47-54). These stu dies did not use third generation ELISA methods and were therefore not directly comparable to the already mentioned studies. In a PCV7 efficacy trial (Kaiser Permanente study ), almost 40 000 infants were randomized to receive either PCV7 or meningococcal vaccine in a double blind fashion (55). Children with low birth weight or preterm birth were included in the trial and the immunogenicity data for this subgroup was reported in a separate article by Shinefield et al (53). The immunogenicity was evaluated by the vaccine manufacturers laboratory , now Pfizer\u00b4s laboratory, Rochester USA, using second generation ELISA methods. The authors concluded that PCV7 was as immunogenic in LBW and preterm infants as in normal birth weight and full- term infants. In summary, anti -pneumococcal GMCs were above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for the majority of vaccine serotypes after both primary and booster d oses. Over 90% of preterm infants achieved GMCs above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for the majority of vaccine serotypes after the primary series, but the rate reaching this level was lower for the infants with the lowest GA . In general, the response rate against s erotypes 3, 5, 6A, 6B and 23F were somewhat lower after the primary series. After the booster dose almost all preterm infants had GMCs above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for all vaccine -serotypes. 25 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Effectiveness Effectiveness against pertussis A Danish cohort study by Hviid et al included almost 880 000 infants with GA 20-41 hospitalized with pertussis in the period 1990-2004 (56). In 1990-1996 wP vaccine was given at 5 and 9 weeks and a booster at 10 months. From 1997 mono-component aP vaccine replaced the wP vaccine i n a 3, 5 and 12 month schedule. Pr eterm infants were vaccinated later than full-term infants, especially those receiving wP vaccine. Effectiveness of the wP vaccine i n preterm infants for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose was calculated t o -23%, 47% and 95% respectively. Compared to full-term infants a reduced response was observed after the 1st dose, but not after the 2nd and 3rd dose. Effectiveness of the aP vaccine in preterm infants for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose were 45%, 77% and 90% respectively, and statistically similar to full-term infants. In a Norwegian cohort study by Riise et al, 713 000 infants were studied between 1998 and 2010 (1). Irrespective of GA, aP-combination vaccine was recommended at age 3, 5 and 12 months according to Norwegian recommendations . Age at vaccination was not reported, however the analysis controlled for different chronological age at vaccination between preterm and full-term children. The vaccine effectiveness for reported pertussis among children born preterm for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose was 73.0% 80.1% and 93.0%, while the effectiveness for reported pertussis hospitalization for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose was 71.2%, 93.8% and 88.7%, respectively , statistically s imilar to children born full-term. Effectiveness and efficacy against pneumococ cal disease We did not identify any studies on effectivene ss post-licensure against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) for preterm children. The efficacy of PCV7 in 4340 preterm children 38 weeks GA was assessed in the pivotal Kaiser Permanente randomized double blind study (RCT) mentioned earlier on page 24 (55). Infants received either PCV7 or meningococca l C conjugate vaccine (MCV) concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines at ages 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months. For the main efficacy analysis, the disease had to be caused by vaccine serotypes and with disease onset more than 14 days after the 3rd dose in addition to occurring in a subject vaccinated according to protocol. Children at l east 16 months of age were considered fully vaccinated after receipt of the 4th dose. Black et al reports nine children with IPD in the control group and zero in the PCV7 group giving a vaccine efficacy of 100% (57). Further details from studies on effectiveness against pertussis and efficacy against pneumococci are found in Table A7 in the appendix. In summary, aP vaccine induced effectiveness against whooping cough was similar among preterm and full -term children in a national recommended 3, 5 and 12 month schedule. The efficacy of PCV7 when administered at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months in preterm infants, was 100% against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine -serotypes . Specific data on efficacy or effectiveness after the first dose given at 2 months to preterm infants were not identifi ed neither for aP nor PCV vaccine . 26 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Safety The main objective of the safety part of this literature review was to evaluate the incidence of apnea or death after the first dose of aP and/or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Of the 26 studies included in the safety assessment (Figure 2), many of the studies demonstrated selection bias. Specifically, a number of the studies preferentially included children that were hospitalized for a pro longed period (tending to inflate number of events, over - estimate risk), or oppositely included only stable, well children (tending to reduce number of events, underestimate risk). Using GRADE terminology, only 8 studies were found with some ( or ) qual ity of evidence to a nswer the main objectives of this review. Definitions of apnea used in different safety studies Apnea was defined as cessation of breathing for 20 seconds (s) or longer in most studies. In some studies cessation of breathing for more t han 15 s accompanied by bradycardia or desaturation was classified as apnea. In other studies, apnea was not presented separately, but together with bradycardia or bradycardia and desaturation (ABD) episodes. It was decided to include those studies because very few studies reported the outcome apnea alone and because apnea in neonates is often associated with, or difficult to contrast from, episodes of bradycardia due to desaturation. Definitions of bradycardia varied in the studies included, with heart ra te limits varying from < 80 beats per minute (bpm) to < 100 bpm, and duration varying from 10 to 20 s. Definitions of desaturation varied from oxygen saturation < 85 % to < 88 %. In most studies, desaturation was reported without a time limit, but in one t here was a time limit of 15 s in the definition. Does vaccination during the first months of life of preterm infants increase the risk of apnea/ABD events (mean GA at birth < 28 weeks)? There were 13 studies including infants with mean GA 28 weeks or youn ger studying apnea/ABD events after the first dose of vaccine that fulfilled the criteria in the literature search. Only six of these studies fulfilled all the quality assessment criteria in this review (58-63) (Table 3). The six studies are described in detail below. 27 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Table 3.

Mean GA at birth was 26.4 weeks and mean postnatal age at immunization was 76 days. All infants we re monitored electronically pre- and post-immunization. Endpoints included apn ea and bradycardia requiring stimulation, defined as apn ea responding to tactile stimulation and/or low flow oxygen administratio n and/or responding to positive pressure by means of a face mask. The incidence of apn ea requiring stimulation was increased post-vaccination (23 %) in the 48 h post -vaccination compared to pre- vaccination period (15 %), but the difference was not statistically significantly . Schulzke et al retrospectively analysed medical records of 53 Swiss preterm infants with mean GA of 28 weeks, hospitalized for at least eight weeks after birth and who had received their first vaccination with Infanrix-IPV+Hib\u00ae or Infanrix-hexa\u00ae between 2000 and 2003 in the NICU (59). All infants had a previous history of typical apn ea or bradycardia of prematurity. At the time of immuniz ation, all infan ts were medically stable and did not require any ventilatory support or oxygen supplementation. Infants were continuous ly monitored electronically. Seven infants (13 %) in this study of clinically stable infant s, showed a transient recurrence of or increase in episodes of apnea or bradycardia episodes 8 -24 h following immunization. Five of these seven infants required intervention ranging from tactile stimulation to bag and mask ventilation. All episodes settled within 48 h . An RCT conducted by Carbone et al in 10 NICUs in the US between 2000 and 2004 enrolled 191 infants who were born at mean GA 26 .9 weeks and who at the time of the study entry were 56-60 days in chronological age (60). Infants we re randomly assigned to receive immunization with either Infanrix\u00ae or Pediatrix\u00ae immunization (n =93) or no vaccine (n =98). Infants were included only if clinically stable. Recording monitors were used continuously during 48 h post-vaccination to document prolonged apnea and prolonged bradycardia. In this study of clinically stable infants , 16.1 % of infants in the vaccinated group experienced at least one episode of prolonged apnea , compared with 28 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health 20.4 % of control infants. The frequency of episodes was not significantly differ ent between groups. Infants in both the immunization group and the control group each ha d an average of 0.5 episodes of prolonged apnea. Between 1998 and 2006 , Furck et al enrolled 473 German preterm infants with a birth weight under 1500 g i n a prospective observationa l study (61). All infants received their first vaccination during their primary hospitalization in the neonatal ward . Mean GA at birth was 27.6 weeks and all were immunized and observed for up to 48 h post - vaccination. In infants already suffering from single apnea/bradycar dia events before immunization, only an increase in frequency was us ed as an adverse event. Three different vaccinee combinations were used and 260 infants received Infanrix-hexa\u00ae and Prevenar\u00ae (group C). In this group 15 % of the infants had apnea in the 48 h post -immunization period. Infants with apnea were born on an average 1.4 weeks earlier than those without apnea (26.3\u00b11.8 versus 27.7\u00b12.1 weeks). The incidence of apnea decreased with increasing gestational week at birth. Anderson et al conducted a retrospective audit between 2001 and 2011 in the tertiary neonatal centers of South Australia (62). A database was searched for record s of suspected vaccine reactions in extremely preterm babies. The 203 babies identified had mean GA of 26.3 weeks and received their first immunization at mean age of 71 days while still admitted to the NICU . All babies were immunized in accordance with national guidelines but the vaccines used varied slightly over the 10-year period due to changes in the Australian Immunization Schedule and were eithe r 1) Infanrix -hepB\u00ae and -hexa\u00ae and Prevenar\u00ae. Cardiorespiratory monitoring at the time of first immunization was routine clinical practice. A likely apneic reaction was defined as occurring within 24 h and resolving within 48 h, as a clinically important increase in apn ea and that there was an absence of confounding factors. Once babies with potential va ccine reactions were identified from the database, medical records were independently reviewed by each author. Apneic reactions were then reclassified into lik ely, possible or unlikely using predefined criteria. After independent classification, a consensus d ecision on final classification was derived. Following medical record review, 12 were classified with a likely apne ic reaction, five with a possible apneic reaction and one with an unlikely reaction possibly caused by first vaccination . In all cases prior to immunization there wa s no clinically significant apnea, and no respiratory support was re quired. The incidence o f likely or possible apn ea following first immunization was 8.4 % within 24 h post -vaccination. Wilinska et al studied 73 infants born at GA 28 weeks or younger (mean GA 27 weeks) admitted to the NICU and vaccinated at a mean age of 49 days with Infanrix -IPV+Hib\u00ae and Prevenar\u00ae (63). The infants\u00b4 cardiac and respiratory functions were monitored over 72 h after vaccination and followed up according to standardized protocol. Apnea within 72 h after vaccination occurred in five infants (7 %). The other seven studies on infants with mean GA 28 weeks or younger were assessed but not further described because they did not fulfilled all the criteria for the quality assessment. These studies were assessed as having reporting-, observation -, and/or selection-bias and did not contribute any further information regarding the PICO of this review (64-70). Even so, Hacking et al (68) is a large study that adds important information on risk factors for severe events post -immunization in preterm infants, and will therefore be further described in the section below on page 32 regarding risk factors associated with the risk of apnea/ABD events and in the discussion. 29 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Does vaccinat ion during the first months of life of preterm infants increase the risk of apnea/ABD events (mean GA at birth > 28 - < 30 weeks)? There were six studies including infants with mean GA > 28 - < 30 weeks studying apnea/ABD events that fulfilled all the criteria in the literature search. Two of these studies also fulfilled the quality assessment and will be mentioned in detail below (Table 4 )( 63, 71). Table 4. S tudies included in the safety assessment of apnea/ABD events a fter first vaccination in infants with mean GA at birth > 28 - < 30 weeks Reference Study design GA in weeks (mean) N Observational time post - vaccination (hours) Vaccine Faldella 2007 (71) Prospective observational 28.4 81 72 DTaP -IPV-Hib-HepB (Infanrix hexa\u00ae) Wilinska 2016 (b) -IPV-Hib (Infanrix -IPV+Hib\u00ae) PCV7 (Prevenar\u00ae) F safety of hexavalent vaccine (DTaP -IPV+Hib+HBV, vaccine type not specified) in very premature infants born at less than 31 weeks gestation (71). All babies were continuously monitored for three days before and after vaccination to record episodes of ABD-episodes and related interventions. ABD -episodes were consi dered moderate when responding to tactile stimulation and/or low -flow O 2 administration, and severe when sustained respiratory support (O 2 delivered through CPAP or mechanical ventilation) was required. Eighty-one preterm newborns were included with a mean GA 28.4 weeks and mean age at vaccination 73 days. Forty -five infants were vaccinated while admitted to NICU; 19 infants were discharged before vaccination; 17 infants were vaccinated at primary level hospital. Among the 45 babies immunized in the NICU, 2 2 received the vaccine between age 60 and 90 days. For 17 infants, immunization was given before they were 60 days old (49 - 59 days) to allow immunization under medical monitoring before hospital discharge. Finally, in six cases immunization was postponed beyond 90 days of life because of some kind of clinical problem. ABD -episodes related to vaccination was recorded in five infants (6.2 %), all in the group of newborns with chronic disease. Wilinska et al conducted a study on 65 infants admitted to NICU an d born at 29 -36 gestational weeks (63) . Infants were vaccinated at a mean age of 44 days with Infanrix - IPV+Hib \u00ae and Prevenar\u00ae. The infants\u00b4 cardiac and resp iratory functions, as well as body temperature was monitored over 72 h after vaccination and followed up according to standardized protocol . Apnea occurred in 1 infant (2 %) after vaccination . The other four studies including infants with mean GA > 28 - < 30 weeks were assessed but not furth er described because they did not fulfil all the criteria for the quality assessment. These studies were evaluated to have reporting-, observation -, and/or selection-bias and did not contribute any further information t o this review (40, 49, 72, 73). 30 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Does vaccination during the first months of life of preterm infants increase the risk of apnea/ABD events (mean GA > 30 - < 32 weeks)? There were three studies included from the literature search on infants with mean GA > 30 - < 32 weeks (37, 54, 74) . Only one fulfilled the quality criteria and is mentioned below (Table 5) (74). Table 5.

The 41 babies with mean GA 30.8 weeks received their first immunization at mean age of 9.2 weeks and were vaccinated a t the NICU or after being discharged . Infants vaccinated at the NICU were observed 48 h post-vaccination. Vaccines used was Pediacel\u00ae, Infanrix-hexa\u00ae and Prevenar\u00ae. No apneic events were reported in the post-vaccination period. Two studies were assessed bu t not further described d ue to problems w ith study quality. These studies were assessed as having reporting-, observation -, and/or selection-bias and thereby no adding value (37, 54). Does vaccination during the first months of life of preterm infants increase the risk of apnea/ABD events (mean G A > 32 - < 37 weeks)? There were two studies included from the literature s earch in this group. One study included infants with mean GA > 32 - < 37 weeks and the other study included infants with GA ranging between 32 to 36 weeks (40, 52). These studies were assessed as having reporting-, observation -, and/or selection-bias and thereby not further described. Summary of apnea/ABD events after first vaccinatio n in premature infants related t o GA The eight studies that fulfilled the criteria for the quality assessment described in the paragraphs above are included in Figure 8 (58-63, 71, 74). The study by Wilinska et al has two data points since the study included two different GA -groups; a) a nd b). In this figure incidence of apnea/AB D events within 48-72 h (except Anderson et al with 24 h observation) period after first vaccination is described as a function of GA at birth. 31 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Figure 8 Incidence (%) of apnea /ABD -events in preterm infants 48 -72 hours after first vaccination as function of mean GA at birth There is a clear tendency of lower incidence of apnea/ABD events with higher GA at birth (Figure 8). No correlation between the chronologic age of the infants at first vaccination and the rate of occurrence of apnea/ABD events was found in studies included in the review of apnea/ABD events described above (58-63, 71, 74, 75) . Does vaccination during the first months of life of preterm infants increase the risk of apnea/ABD events after concomitant vaccination with multiple vaccines? Three studies with data on the impact of concomitant vaccinatio n with multiple vaccines are previously summarized in Table 3. In Furck et al all premature infants with a birth weight below 1500 g who received their first vaccination during their primary hospitalization, between 1998 and 2006 were included prospectively. Infants received three different vaccine combinations according to time per iod when they were included into the study; in group A, 162 infants were included from January 1998 to November 2000 and received Infanrix -IPV-Hib\u00ae, and Gen H-B-Vax K pro infantibus\u00ae (DTaP-Hib and HepB vaccine); in group B, 51 infants were included from 2000 to 2001 and received Infanrix -hexa\u00ae; in group C, 260 infants were included from 2001 to 2006 and received Infanrix -hexa\u00ae and Prevenar\u00ae. There was significantly more apnea and bradycardia in infants in group C, vaccinated with both Prevenar\u00ae and Infanri x\u00ae-combination compared to a group A and B, vaccinated with DTaP-containing vaccines alone. W hen correcting for age this difference was no longer significant between group B and C (61). As the groups in this study were not well balanced, there may be residual confounding and a firm conclusion cannot be drawn from this observational study. 0510152025 26 26,5 27 27,5 28 28,5 29 29,5 30 30,5 31 31,5Incidence (%) GA at (weeks)Ellis on 2005 Wilinska 2016 (a)Furck 2010 Schulzke 2005Carbone 2008 2013 Faldell a 2007 Wilinska 2016 (b) Buijs 201232 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health In Schulzke et al , there was no difference in the incidence of apnea/bradycardia between infants if vaccinated with two different DTaP -containing vaccines within 72 h post - vaccination period (59). In Ellison et al, 48 very preterm infants were immunized during the period; 37 infants with Comvax\u00ae (Hib and hepatitis -B), Infanrix\u00ae and ina ctivated poliomyelitis vaccine (vaccine type not specified) , and 11 infants with Comvax\u00ae and Infanrix\u00ae only (58). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of apnea within the 48 h post - vaccination period when comparing the two groups. What other factors are correlated with clinical deterioration after vacci nation? In a study by DeMeo et al described below on page 34 , they did not look at apnea/ABD events as an outcome, but rather the need for increased respiratory support (76) and thereby did not fulfilled the criteria in the literature search. Due to high quality and large number of extremely preterm infants studied, this study is still of interest for this evaluation. Results showed an increase in respiratory support from 6.6/1,000 patie nt- days in the pre -vaccination period to 14.0/1,000 patient -days in the post -vaccination period. The incidence of need for increased respiratory support was 12.7/1,000 patient - days after DTaP Also, incidence of intubation was similar between those three vaccine groups, 3.5/1 ,000. DeMeo et al observed a decrease in the incidence of respiratory support and intubation in the 30 -day period before first immunization leading up to immunization day , especially in the several days before immunization. The investigators, as well as the editorial comment from Kuzniewicz and Klein in the same issue of JAMA pediatrics (77), highlight this observation as possibly indicating the well-known healthy vaccinee effect, by which physicians postpone immunization until children are clinically stable to immunize, thus reducing the observed incidence of pre -immunization adverse events and overestimating the rate ratio of adverse events post -immunization /adverse events pre -immunization . Hacking et al , mentioned previously o n page 28, sought to find risk factors associated with the requirement for intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) or CPAP following immuniz ation (68). Of the 411 infants who were immunized in hospital at about 2 months of age, 368 received their immunization without any respiratory support whilst 43 w ere vaccinated on either IPPV or CPAP. The mean age at immunization was 73 days and the mean corrected GA was 37.5 weeks. Infants who required respiratory support following immunization had the same GA, birth weight, Apgar scores and weight at discharge as those infants whose immunization was not associated with respiratory deterioration. There was no difference between the two groups in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or the requirement for IPPV and CPAP. However, the infants requiring respiratory support post -vaccination had an increased total accumulated time on CPAP as well as a higher incidence of septicemia prior to vaccination. In Wilinska et al mentioned previously on pages 28 and 29, six out of 138 (4 %) infants had post -vaccin ation apnea (63). The occurrence of apnea after vaccination positively correlated with the time of non -invasive ventilation and the occurrence of late infec tion. Long -term non -invasive respiratory support and late infections were shown to be risk factors for apnea following vaccinations. Late infection was defined as clinical signs of infection after the third day of life in addition to abnormal laboratory ma rkers of infection and/or by positive blood -, urine - or cerebrospinal fluid culture. 33 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health How long after vaccination does the increased risk of apnea/ABD event persist? In Table 6 studies with information on time -point for last observed apnea/ABD event post-vaccination are listed. The overall time -point for observed apnea ranged from 3 to 48 h post-vaccination (59, 62) . Table 6 Studies with information on time -point for last observed apnea/ABD event post -vaccination Reference Study design Observational time post -vaccination (first dose) (hours) Time -point for last observed post -vaccination apnea/ABD events (hours) Schulzke 2005 (59) Retrospective observational 72 Apneas started 8 -24 h after vaccination and settled wi thin 48 h after vaccination Anderson 2013 (62) Retrospective observational 48 Apneas occurred 3 -20 h after vaccination Three studies did not fulfill all the requirements for providing valid answers to the PICO questions of this review, but they are listed underneath because they provide time point data for last observed apnea/ABD event post vaccination (72, 75, 78) . In a prospective observational study by Pourcyrous et al, 239 preterm infants at >2 months of age were immun ized with the first dose of vaccine in the NICU (72). Cardiorespiratory manifestations were monitored for 72 h post -vaccination. Onset of new cardiorespiratory symptoms or worsening of cardiorespiratory status was noted 4 to 66 h after vaccination; 95 % occurred within 48 h of vaccination. Pfiste r et al conducted an observational study of 78 very low birth weight premature infants (mean gestational age, 28 \u00b1 2 weeks) given first dose DTaP -IPV-HiB vaccine before hospital discharge (75). Immunization was performed under continuous monitoring, 24 h preceding and 48 h after vaccination. Apnea/ABD events occurred in the first 48 h after vaccination and all infants returned to baseline within 48 to 72 h. In a study performed by Clifford et al , seven preterm infants had recurrent apnea (both at first and at second vaccination) (78). Apnea after the second dose occurred 0 -12 h post - vaccination in three infants, 24 h in three other infants and 30 h in the last infant. For children with apnea after the first vaccination, is there an increased risk of apnea also after the second vaccination? A study by Anderson et al mentioned previously on page 28, included 203 extremely preterm infants vaccinated during inpatient care (62). Apnea/ABD events were reported after the first vaccine dose for 17 (8%) of children. In twelve of these, apnea was assessed by the investigators as likely and five as possibly causally associated with immunization . All except one of the 17 infants were given a second dose and none of them suffered adverse events after this dose (Table 3). In a sub analysis in Furck et al, mentioned previously on page s 28 and 31 forty-seven of the 473 infants initially included received a second vaccin e dose while still in hospital (61). After the second vaccination, apnea and bradycardia occurred in two infants, neither of which had apnea or bradycardia after their first vaccination. Clifford et al , mentioned previously on this page, included 38 Aus tralian preterm infants (<37 wee ks GA , median GA of 27 weeks) with reporte d apnea after first vacci nation (78). 34 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Seven (18 %) had recurrent apnea in timely connection with dose two at four month s chronological age; two of the episodes were self-resolving and t he other five responded to stimulation . None of the infants with a second apnea had recurrence of apnea after the third vaccine dose. In Flatz -Jequier et al, not mentioned previously, preterm infants were studied after each of the first two vaccinations (73). Infants (mean GA at birth 26. 6 weeks) that experienced apnea/ABD event after first vaccination were observed for apnea/ABD events after second vaccination , vaccinated with second dose at a mean age of 98.4 days. Among the 33 infants who had a significant apnea/ABD event after first vaccination, six (18 %) had a recurrent apnea/ABD event also after the second vaccination. Four of those six children were monitored again during the third vaccination, which was well tolerated by all. The only difference seen in this study between the infants with adverse reactions after the second vaccination compared with th ose without reaction was a previous reaction at the first vaccination. No reactions were seen in the group who did not r eact at the first vaccination. Does vaccination of premature infants during the first months of life increase the risk of death? All 26 studies included in this review were assessed for the outcome of reported fatal cases post -vaccination. Three studies reported fatal events (40, 41, 76) . A multicenter observational study by D'Angio et al mentioned previously under immunogenicity on page 22, includ ed 369 preterm infants with GA < 32 weeks and a birth weight of 401-1500 g in a pre -specified, according to a specific vaccinated within a time - line, cohort (41). Infants had rec eived a primary series of three PCV7 doses, given at least four weeks apart, and completed the study within the time windows defined . Two infants, neither in the time -line cohort , died of sudden infant death syndrome within 4 months after vaccination. Omenaca et al mentioned previously under immunogenicity on page 24, studied adverse events in 137 preterm infants vaccinated with 10-valent PCV (Synflorix\u00ae) at 2, 4, 6 and 16- 18 months age (40). One infant death associated with choking after aspiration was reported . The event occurred 25 days after the third vaccine dose and was assessed by the investigator as not causally related to vaccination. In a multicentre retrospective cohort study by DeMeo et al , mentioned previously on page 32, described above, 13926 extremely preterm infants born at 28 weeks' gestation or less receiving at least one vaccination between the ages of 53 -110 days (DTaP -IPV-HiB, DTaP - IPV-HepB and PCV7) were included (76). Five deaths were reported post -vacci nation. Three of the five infants died within three days after vaccination and had a diagnosis associated with d eath unrelated to vaccination (bowel perforati on, necrotizing enterocolitis and presumed sepsis, pneumonia and respiratory failure , respectively) . No further information about the two remaining infants was available in the study report. In summary, 0-23 % of preterm infants had apnea/ABD events in the 48-72 h post - vaccination period . There was a clear tendency of lower incidence of apnea/ABD events with higher GA at birth. There was no correlation between the chronologic age a t first vaccination and the incidence of apnea/ABD events. Some infants had increased risk, especially infants with previous sepsis or previous lung disease . A causal relationship between vaccination and death was not found in any study. 35 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Discussion Premature infants are more vulnerable than full -term infants in several aspects. Depending on the degree of prematurity, premature infants may have incomplete transfer of maternal antibodies before birth (79). In addition , they have immature immune systems. This increases the risk of vaccine -preventable disease s such as whooping cough and invasive pneumococcal disease (1, 2). The first dose of pertussis vaccine given in infancy is known to protect against death due to pertussis (12, 80). Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have on their si de provided a dramatic impact on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in infants globally (81). In Norway and Sweden, premature infants have historically been recommended the same vaccines and schedules as full -term infants. However, due to the vulnerability and comorbidities of preterm infants, as well as the fear of adverse events after vaccination, the uptake and timeliness of v accination has not been as good for this group as that of full - term infants. The aim of this literature review was to gain knowledge around the immunogenicity, effectiveness and safety of vaccination of premature infants against whooping cough and invasive pneumococcal disease in order to inform future vaccination policy for this risk group. Immunogenicity The evaluation of vaccine responses against pertussis and pneumococcal antigens in this report is mainly dependent on IgG ELISA results from different laboratories. It was decided to limit the selection of immunogenicity studies to those using standardized methods. Immunogenicity data from different laboratories should nevertheless be compared with caution due to the possibility of residual differences in methodology. The ELISA method used for pertussis was standardized for vaccine trials during the 1990s and has subsequently been developed for seroepidemiological studies and for diagnostic purposes. Since there is no established correlate of protection for pertussis, the clinical relevance of immunogenicity results may be difficult to determine with certainty . There is consensus among regulatory authorities that the achievement of similar post -vaccination antibody levels , as those obtained in earlier vaccine efficacy tr ials on aP vaccines, is necessary and sufficient for licensure of a new pertussis vaccine, indicating that such levels may infer protection (82, 83). Eight studies retrieved in this literature review reported immunogenicity data after vaccinatin g premature infants with aP-containing combination vaccines . Antibody levels were similar to that obtained for full -term infants. Results were also fairly consistent across studies and indicated that preterm inf ants have a good immune response to pertussis vaccination both with the use of different aP-containing combination vaccines and various vaccine schedules (2+1, 3+0 and 3+1). Preterm infants with GA below 31 weeks reach somewhat lower GMCs post primary seri es than older preterm and full-term infants. However, there is reason to believe that these lower levels still induce protection against whooping cough since antibody levels were in the same range as those obtained in earlier pertussis vaccine efficacy studies (82, 83). Furthermore, all infants, including the smallest preterms, showed a good response to booster dose. Todays WHO standard for asses sing pneumococcal vaccine immunogenicity (third generation ELISA using both CPS and 22F preadsorption) was established in 2003. A 36 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health common cut -off of 0.35 \u00b5g/ml has been chosen by consensus among experts , but there is still disagreement whether this threshold is a good general proxy indicating clinical protection . Both IgG ELISA and opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) should be performed in future immunogenicity studies (26). Of the five studies on pneumococcal immunogenicity reviewed in this report, most showed that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are immunogenic in preterm infants, also with the first dose given as early as 2 months age. Anti-pneumococcal IgG GMCs after the primary series are somewhat lower than for full-term infants, but most preterm infants develop anti - pneumococcal IgG above 0.35 \u00b5g/ml for the majority o f serotypes included in the vaccines . Serotypes 3, 5, 6A, 6B and 23F elicit the lowest immune response s in several studies , especially in the preterm infants with the lowest GA . A 3+1 schedule with at least one of the intervals in the primary series longer than one month seems superior for reaching the threshold of 0.35 \u00b5g/ml during the high -risk period in the fi rst 6 months of life, even though the number of infants studied is limited. The ability to respond to pneumococcal vaccines seems to be corre lated with gestational age at birth and not with chronological age at vaccination , implying that vaccination should not be delayed unnecessar ily. Effectiveness and efficacy We found two studies (one Danish and one Norwegian) on pertussis hospitalization and vaccine effectiveness. The effectiveness of aP vaccine on pertussis hospitalization was comparable in preterm and full -term children (difference not statistically significant) (1, 56). Among preterm children the vaccine effectiveness after the 3rd dose was 89 -90%, but with wide confidence intervals. The Norwegian study also included reported pertussis as an outcome and found statistically similar vaccine effectiveness in preterm and full -term infants (89% and 91% respectively ) after the 3rd dose (1). The studies included on aP vaccine effectiveness followed a 3, 5 and 12 months schedule . Effectiveness after the 1st dose was between 45% and 71 -73%, with wide con fidence intervals. We did not identify data on vaccine effectiveness after a 1st dose administered as early as 2 months of age. It is therefore difficult to estimate the effect of aP vaccines on clinically significant pertussis disease in the first six mon ths of life when the first dose is given as early as two months age. The especially high risk of pertussis among children aged less than six months and the consequence of severe pertussis complications among young infants is nevertheless in favor of vacci nation from 2 months of age as long as it is safe and immunogenic (1, 84). Only one study on vaccine efficacy and IPD was included in this review . The RCT demonstrated 100% vaccine efficacy against vaccine serotypes (PCV7) for IPD in preterm children. The schedule was 2, 4, 6 and 12 -15 months of age. Those who had received 3 or 4 doses of PCV7 were included in the efficacy analysis. The study had few IPD cases and did not report vaccine efficacy after the 1st dose at age 2 months (53, 57). The evidence of vaccine efficacy after one d ose at 2 months is unknown, and recommen d- ations on a 1st dose at 2 months should be based on studies on immuneogenicity and safety as well as epidemiological studies on the burden of disease in the youngest infants . 37 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Safety Apnea/ABD events in the post -vaccination period in this review is described in 0 - 23 % of children born prematurely (Table A8 in the appendix). There is a clear tendency for lower incidence of apnea/ABD events within 48-72 h post-vaccination, with higher gestationa l age at birth (Figure 3). Percentage of children with increased and/or recurrent apnea/ABD events vary between studies, largely due to differences in methodology and definitions. In the only randomised controlled study in this review, no difference was seen between the vaccinated group and the controls (60). However, a large American study showed an increased need for respiratory support in preterm infants post -vaccination (76). Also, historical data on wP vaccines and clinical experience in Sweden (personal communication Andreas Ohlin , paediatrician at \u00d6rebro University Hospital, Feb 2018 , abstract and oral presentation at Sachs' Children and Youth Hospital , Stockholm, Nov. 2015 presented by Karin B\u00e4ck) has shown that vaccination of extremely preterm babies can lead to cardiorespiratory instability. Therefore monitoring of preterm infants after vaccination is important. Preterm infants with underlying co -morbidities may be more at risk for severe events after immunization. Hacking and co -workers describe that severe apn ea leading to the requirement of respiratory suppo rt appeared to be associated with immunization , particularly in ELBW infants with significant lung disease and those who have previously experienced septicemia (68). This is also found in a small study by Wilinska et al (63). It can be concluded that there are some risk groups, especially preterm infants with previous sepsis, previous clinical significant apneas or previous lung disease . Such infants in addition to infants born before GA 30+0 weeks and those who are cardiorespiratory unstable at the time of vaccination, may need prolonged observation after vaccination. All 26 studies included in this review were assessed fo r the outcome of reported fatal cases post -vaccination. There were in total three studies that reported fatal cases (40, 41, 76). Eight fatal cases were reported in these three studies. Six of these cases are described in detail and a causal relationship between vaccination and death has not been found. Only one study indicated that multiple vaccines given concurrently, relevant for the Swedish and Norwegian NIP (Infanrix\u00ae plus Prevenar\u00ae) may give more apnea and bradycar dia than DTaP-containing vaccine alone (61). However the study design included low number of infants and had significant difference between the study groups and when corre cting for age the difference was no longer significant between compared groups. Prospective studies are needed to make any conclusions if there is an increased risk of apnea/ABD events when multiple vaccines, especially conjugated vaccines, are given concurrently. Most studies, have not shown increased risk of apnea at second vaccination for infants with apnea/ABD event after the first vaccination. However, some preterm infants with reported apnea after first v accination also had apnea at the second vaccination at four month of age (73, 78). There may be a need for monitoring infants with a history of apnea post dose 1 also after dose 2, as best decided by the child's pediatrician. 38 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health Conclusion The risk of pertussis and invasive pneumococcal disease is high in preterm infants. Acellular p ertussis and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines a re immunogenic and effective in preterm infants . The benefit of vaccination clearly outweighs the risks, and vaccination should in general not be withheld or delayed . Vaccination starting at approximately 8 weeks chronological age decreases the risk of severe disease, especially with regards to pertussis. As there is waning of immunity, a booster in the second year of life is recommended. While the infants' chronological age at vaccination does not seem to affect the risk of cardiorespiratory side effects, the GA at birth with lower risk in higher GA groups. Preterm infants with underlying co -morbidities may be more at risk for severe events after immunization . Infants born before 30+0 weeks of gestation, infants with significant lung disease, those who have previously experienced septicaemia and preterm infants that are cardiorespiratory unstable at the time of vaccination, need cardio respiratory monitoring for at least 48 h post -vaccination. A causal relationship between vaccination and death has not been found in any study. 39 Vaccination of premature infants against pertussis and pneumococci Norwegian Institute of Public Health References 1.
