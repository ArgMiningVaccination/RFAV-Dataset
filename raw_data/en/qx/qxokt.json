Her overall health is great and she can also drive herself whenever she feels like it. Most importantly, her mental health is excellent. She is cheerful and can get along with people extremely well. Let Khun Pisamai share with you a little more about her health care practices and tips on staying beautiful: Normally, I am a very health conscious person. Each day I have to do so many tasks without a fixed schedule therefore I have to make sure that I am on top of my game. Luckily, I rarely have health problems compared to most people my age. Having said that, I then started experiencing pain in both of my legs and knees. I realized that I had to also control my blood pressure to an acceptable level. Honestly, I have been taking very good care of myself since I was 30 years old. I would normally select things like ginseng, vitamins and stick to strict healthy practices in order to look after myself. When I got older, I avoided eating meat because of my poor digestive system which was caused by not chewing my food properly due to my busy schedule. Recent health problems My real problem were my legs and bones. I used to be in many action films when I was younger. I used to do my own stunts in the action scenes and had my fair share of falls. In the past, we were required to do our own stunts. I now feel the effects as I grew older. I went through several MRIs and check-ups to keep my health in check. In addition, I get a lot of health advices whenever I participated in hospital events. I sincerely appreciate the doctors taking their time explaining which helps add to my health awareness. Ultimately, I am very grateful to my friend who introduced me to the Absolute Health Integrative Clinic (Absolute Health) a few years back. Absolute Health is an Integrative Medicine clinic for chronic disease management, holistic beauty, anti-aging and rejuvenation. I was totally impressed when I first went there for my appointment. Their Integrative Medicine pathways team of medical experts plus high-tech equipment that were rarely found in most hospitals, really stood out from the other medical practices that I used to visit. During my first appointment, the doctor did a thorough body check up with the Quantum Scan. It provided a comprehensive result that indicated and forecasted all the physical conditions as well as risks of developing diseases. Importantly, the check-up was an eye opener to me. Apart from my precise diagnosis, the results also indicated the health risk and signs that I should be wary of. Technically, I can check my whole body condition with just one easy check-up. Another problem that I used to have was neck pains. It actually lead to the numbness in other parts of my body. Back then I had an MRI done and found that my joints had some problems. As this problem was chronic, I also began to develop pain in my back and hip. My conventional medicine doctor prescribed various types of medicaments that I had to take on a regularly basis. That was one of the actually reasons why I was seeking an alternative form of treatment and was introduced to Absolute Health. My treating doctor in Absolute Health immediate added rehabilitation to my treatment plan plus accelerate the results by using cell therapy (natural extracts) to reactivate the bone cells. Apart from that, I also did Chelation which was a form of detox that helped eliminate heavy metals and waste around blood vessels. The treatment methodology focuses on the root cause which was actually high blood pressure for me. The check-up I did also showed that my blood flow was not optimised due to some blockage. Let me be honest, I felt a world of difference and it was great as everything slowly got better after the treatment. I felt that my physical condition was very much better and I did not feel drained or tired when I work or walk a long distance. The treatment had tremendously improved the quality of my life. At Absolute Health, disease prevention and management are only part of the specialities available. There are also skincare and beauty services which includes: - fine thread lifting to keep your face and neck looking naturally firm - laser treatment to make your face white and radiant - spot and wrinkle correction With Absolute Health, I am now able to care of both my beauty and overall physical health. I really enjoy going for my appointments. I always feel at home whenever I am there. I am always extremely well taken care of by Doctor Chatchai, Doctor Supachee and the team. We would sometimes have meals together and they would give me excellent advice on lifestyles and health care practices. Apart from the clinical treatments, a healthy lifestyle is another way of looking after myself. I enjoy doing exercises and also household chores. For weight control, I do my very best to look after what I eat. I try and avoid unhealthy foods like flour-based products, very sweet food and late night meals. I now go for my annual medical check-up regularly as I still have to closely watch my blood pressure. I also go for a bloody test every 3-4 months to make sure that my health is in line. Now, I emphasize a lot more on preventive measures in order to avoid diseases and at the same time enrich my health. This way, I am able to avoid getting sick and being unable to work. Last but definitely not least, mental health is another important factor that I firmly prioritise on. Keeping my mind active by playing games, can also help prevent Alzheimer's. Whenever I am available, I do my best to make time for movies, listening to music and hanging out with friends. As Doctor Chatchai ever mentioned, 50% of the battle with most health issues can be won with the right mind-set. The other 50% are based on factors like what you eat, lifestyle, discipline and early diagnosis. Always be optimistic. "}
