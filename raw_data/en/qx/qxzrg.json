A person may also have just one sign, a range of signs, or all of them. In a few cases, individuals may not have any signs, making diagnosing the problem challenging. PCOS might not always be a visible medical problem. Some individuals would only find out about their condition when they are experiencing issues in conceiving or when they look for medical help in relation to skin problems or weight loss.

Symptoms of PCOS Problem in Females Menstrual Changes One of the major symptoms of PCOS is a change in the pattern of menstrual periods. Changes in periods may occur when a female is not ovulating on a regular basis, which is a process that takes place when the ovaries liberate an egg. When a female does not ovulate, the uterine lining might become thicker and shed intermittently. Consequently, this abnormal shedding may add to menstrual changes. These changes can be: - Random periods - Missed periods in total (a condition called amenorrhea) - Periods occurring more often - A very light or a very heavy flow Weight Gain Issues linked to weight are other symptoms of PCOS problems in females. Suppose a female observes that she is gaining pounds (10 or more over some months) without incorporating dietary modifications or changes in the exercise routine. In that case, PCOS might likely cause weight gain. Nearly 1/2 of all individuals with PCOS are overweight or obese. Also, females may find some problems in losing weight despite making healthy lifestyle modifications. While this indicates other medical issues, you should begin to track one's eating and exercise habits. And for this, [Breathe Well-Being](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/) would be your great companion to reach your weight loss goals.

That, too, is using a natural lifestyle modification instead of being stuck on medicines for life. Infertility A research study found that 60.2% of people with PCOS reported infertility issues. Infertility is a problem in getting pregnant. And PCOS is found to be the basic reason for infertility, and individuals might not be aware that they have it until they are trying to get pregnant. Infertility may take place because of an irregularity in sex hormones. Having an excess androgen level might have an effect on the frequency of ovulation. And this makes it challenging for the eggs to mature and conceive a baby. And, so, there is a high rate of marriage in females with PCOS. To overcome this issue of infertility naturally, do you know that diet changes play a significant role? Dietary changes can potentially improve fertility outcomes. Following a healthy and nutrient-dense diet can help manage insulin resistance, a significant risk factor for PCOS.

Anxiety, stress, and depression are the next set of PCOS problem symptoms. This might happen because of hormonal changes. Many females with PCOS deal with signs, for example, too much body hair and weight that may affect their body image and self-esteem. This might be unpleasant, particularly if they don't know how and where to get support. In addition, females might experience anxiety or depression if they plan to have a child (or more kids) and PCOS results in fertility problems. Stress is when a person experiences feelings of threat or cannot deal with a situation. A slight level of anxiety may motivate you to act. However, stress in excess may affect health also. Anxiety is a disagreeable feeling of fear, uneasiness, or worry that something terrible will happen or is happening. For a few people, these feelings may become intense and constant. Constant feelings of anxiety may also hinder daily life. Depression is another PCOS problem symptom that negatively affects the thinking and how a person acts or feels. Individuals with depression suffer from continuous and intense thoughts or negative feelings. Depression may even stop a person from performing daily activities like eating or sleeping. Also, it may even make it challenging for a person to function emotionally and physically. Many people face problems sleeping well. This can be due to many reasons; sugar spikes and dips can also make one feel restless. Also, [people with diabetes](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/exercises-for-people-with-diabetes/) urinate quite often, and they fail to realize that it might indicate undiagnosed type 2 diabetes.

Insulin is a hormone produced in the [pancreas](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/ways-to-stimulate-your-pancreas-to-produce-insulin-hormone-in-body/). This hormone helps cells in fat, muscles, liver take in glucose (sugar) from the blood and convert it into energy. Insulin resistance may occur when these body cells experience a difficult time reacting to insulin. And this causes increased blood sugar levels; over half of the females with PCOS develop type 2 diabetes by their 40s. High insulin level is both a sign of PCOS and an original biological driver. Weight loss would also aid in improving the signs regardless of the cause of insulin resistance. Luckily, there are several things a person can do by which his or her insulin sensitivity can be increased, reversing insulin resistance, a major risk factor of type 2 diabetes.
