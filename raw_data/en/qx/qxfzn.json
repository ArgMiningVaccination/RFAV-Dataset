Fortunately, you have a wide variety of options available in pharmacies and big box stores throughout the United States. Even if your preferred brand of medication isn't considered gluten-free, you should be able to find a substitute with the same ingredients. Overview There's a dizzying array of different cough, cold, and flu products available over-the-counter, and each seems to have its own formula. However, these medications mostly rely on combinations of the same seven basic ingredients: acetaminophen, a pain reliever and fever reducer If you look at your symptoms (possibly including pain, fever, nasal congestion, and/or cough), and then look at the ingredients in the products listed, you should be able to identify a gluten-free medication to treat your specific symptoms. Below you'll find a list of name-brand cough, cold, and flu over-the-counter medications and what their manufacturers say about their gluten-free status. In cases where the name-brand products are not considered gluten-free, you'll also find potential store-brand gluten-free substitutes for those products. Advil Cold & Sinus: No Gluten Ingredients Advil Cold & Sinus (non-drowsy) contains the active ingredients ibuprofen 200mg and pseudoephedrine HCI 30 mg. According to Pfizer Consumer Healthcare: \"Gluten is not added to any Advil product during the manufacturing process. However, we cannot guarantee that minute amounts of gluten or gluten derivatives are not contained in raw materials obtained from various suppliers for our manufacturing process since the end product is not tested for gluten.\" Unfortunately, there's no exact gluten-free-labeled equivalent for Advil Cold & Sinus, since few manufacturers include the pain reliever ibuprofen in their cold and flu medicine formulations. To duplicate these ingredients, purchase these gluten-free-labeled products: Target Up & Up Ibuprofen tablets (200 mg ibuprofen)Target Up & Up Sinus PE (30 mg pseudoephedrine HCI) Afrin: Gluten-Free Afrin makes nasal sprays and mists designed to help you clear nasal congestion. Anything you spray into your nose can wind up in your throat, and subsequently in your digestive tract, so any nasal spray you use must be gluten-free. Afrin has numerous nasal spray products, including a \"No Drip\" line that will not drip down your throat. You can choose from Original, Allergy Sinus, Severe Congestion, and Extra Moisturizing in pump mist and nasal sprays. All contain the active ingredient oxymetazoline hydrochloride 0.05%, which is a nasal decongestant. All are safe for those who follow the gluten-free diet, according to manufacturer Bayer, which states, \"None of the Afrin formulas contain gluten.\" Alka-Seltzer Plus: No Gluten Ingredients Alka-Seltzer, known better for its digestive formulas, makes several different cold and flu medications. Alka-Seltzer Plus is available in five formulas: Cold Effervescent Orange tablets (contains aspirin 325 mg, chlorpheniramine maleate 2 mg, and phenylephrine HCI 7.8 mg)Dye-free Multi-Symptom liquid gels for day and night (contain the same ingredients as the Maximum Strength Cold & Flu Day and Night liquigels).Maximum Strength Cold & Flu Day liquid gels (contains acetaminophen 325 mg, dextromethorphan HBr 10 mg, and phenylephrine HCI 5 mg)Maximum Strength Cold & Flu Night liquid gels (contains acetaminophen 325 mg, dextromethorphan HBr 10 6.25 mg, and phenylephrine HCI 5 mg)Severe Cold & Flu dissolving packets in honey lemon zest (contains acetaminophen 325 mg, dextromethorphan HBr 10 mg, guaifenesin 200 mg, and phenylephrine HCI 5 mg) According to manufacturer Bayer: \"We don't add gluten to our products. However, we can't guarantee they are 100% gluten-free since our products are produced in a facility that manufactures and packages items that may contain gluten.\" Unfortunately for those who prefer dissolving packets and effervescent tablets, there aren't any direct gluten-free equivalents for those products; the only products with the same ingredients are liquid caps. Possible gluten-free substitutes for Alka-Seltzer Plus products include: Target Up & Up Daytime Cough and Flu liquid caps (same ingredients as Alka-Seltzer Plus Maximum Strength Cold & Flu Day liquid gels)Target Up & Up Nighttime Cold and Flu liquid caps (same ingredients as Alka-Seltzer Plus Maximum Strength Cold & Flu Night liquid gels) Delsym: No Gluten Ingredients Deslym makes cough products.

Note that there's limited and/or mixed medical evidence showing that these products are effective in preventing or shortening colds or the flu. However, if you're interested in trying them, many are gluten-free. Airborne: Some Gluten-Free Products Airborne, a popular remedy that's designed to help your immune system ward off colds and flu, isn't a drug. Instead, it's a series of supplement-based products designed to help your immune system fight whatever cold or flu bug you've contracted. Airborne first was developed by a teacher who wanted a natural way to fight the colds and flu that inevitably make their way around schools. Out of the various Airborne products, the orange chewable tablets are considered to be gluten-free. Target's Up & Up brand offers gluten-free chewable immune support tablets in two flavors: berry and citrus. Note that the Up & Up effervescent immune support tablets are not gluten-free. Emergen-C: Gluten-Free The Emergen-C products sold in the cold and flu section of the pharmacy are billed as \"enhanced immune support formulas,\" and they contain a combination of vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamins B6 and B12, biotin, zinc, and manganese. They're available in various flavors, including Super Orange, Cherry, Blueberry-Acai, Raspberry, and Citrus. You can purchase formulas that dissolve in water, gummies, and chewables. All Emergen-C products are gluten-free, according to manufacturer Alacer Corp.: \"All EMC products are gluten-free. We adhere to the FDA's regulation for a gluten-free claim. Our products have been tested by an independent third party laboratory that has verified our products to be under 20 parts per millions of gluten and therefore meeting the definition of gluten-free.\" Zicam: No Gluten Ingredients Zicam in \"cold-shortening,\" nasal congestion/sinus relief, allergy relief, and kids' cold relief formulas, and come in chewies, drops, crystals, quick-dissolve tablets, and nasal sprays in many different flavors. According to manufacturer Matrixx Initiatives, Inc.: \"None of the ingredients or manufacturing processes contain glutens derived from wheat, rye or barley. However, some Zicam manufacturing facilities use equipment that may have come in contact with gluten agents.\" Does Wheat-Free Mean the Same As Gluten-Free? Finding a Safe Remedy Although there are numerous gluten-free cold and flu products available, you'll notice that most of those on the market are medications that combine several ingredients (usually a pain reliever, a decongestant, and a cough suppressant). It can be tricky to find gluten-free products that feature only one active ingredient aimed at one cold and flu symptom (for example, a cough suppressant). Target Up & Up Sinus PE tablets (30 mg pseudoephedrine HCI) is one such product, and Target Up & Up Maximum Strength Mucus Relief (guaifenesin 600 mg) is another. It's easier to find single-active-ingredient gluten-free pain relievers since multiple store brands are considered gluten-free. In addition, note that although there are several over-the-counter pain relievers on the market, most cold and flu products designed to offer pain relief and fever reduction include the active ingredient acetaminophen. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that more than 600 over-the-counter medications include acetaminophen\u2014which means you could be taking more of it than is safe. Acetaminophen can cause severe liver damage in doses above the FDA's adult maximum daily dosage of 4,000 mg per day. To avoid exceeding that dose, don't take more than one product (prescription and/or over-the-counter) that includes acetaminophen and never exceed the recommended dose of any product that includes acetaminophen. A few products (mainly Advil Cold & Sinus) use the pain reliever/fever reducer ibuprofen instead of acetaminophen, one Alka-Seltzer product uses the pain reliever/fever reducer aspirin, and one Sudafed product uses the pain reliever/fever reducer naproxen sodium. However, none of these products are considered gluten-free (see the Advil section for substitutes containing ibuprofen). A Word From Verywell Regardless of which cold and flu product you take (and whether or not it includes acetaminophen as an active ingredient), never take more than the recommended daily dose, and don't take more than one multi-symptom product at the same time. There are ways to feel better from the cold and flu without medication, including rinsing your sinuses, using a nasal saline spray, running a humidifier, or combining steam with eucalyptus oil. Consider trying these to improve your symptoms. 11 Popular Natural Remedies for the Common Cold Finally, most colds and flu resolve themselves within about a week without intervention from your healthcare provider. However, you should know when your symptoms warrant medical attention. If you find you have difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, confusion, sudden dizziness, or chest pain, you should seek help right away. 2 Sources Verywell Fit uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
