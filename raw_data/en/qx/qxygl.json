Page 4 :: SCNM Commencement Ceremony June 19, 2021 Dear Friends and Family, On behalf of the SCNM community, welcome to the Commencement ceremony honoring the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine's Graduating Class of Spring 2021. While our graduates didn't envision an online ceremony at the outset of their medical school journey , your participation will help make it heartfelt and memorable. G iven the dramatic changes that telemedicine is bringing to healthcare, a virtual graduation is appropriate as a portent of their future practices . Graduating from medical school is a high point in any physician's life. Sharing the experience with family an d friends present makes it even more so. Thank you for participating in this joyous occasion, and a special thank you to all who helped support these fine women and men in fulfilling their dreams of becoming a naturopathic doctor.

SCNM Commencement Ceremony :: Page 11 Founded in 1992, SCNM prepares the next generation of healthcare providers who will consider all available means to heal patients, with an emphasis on naturopathic therapies that prevent disease before it happens and heals without harming. SCNM's School of Naturopathic Medicine and School of Nutrition educate and train students in the principles and practices of health promotion through evidence -based practices like nutrition, disease management , and prevention. Located in Tempe, Arizona, the College's mission is to educate tomorrow's healthcare innovators in the art and science of integrative wellness. Our two clinics on campus provide clinical experiences for our naturopathic students while serving the community as a resource for primary healthcare (SCNM Medical Center) or non -opioid pain management (Neil Ri ordan Center for Regenerative Medicine). Off campus, our community clinics provide low-cost or free natural healthcare to various underserved populations. SCNM's newest addition, the Ric Scalzo Institute of Botanical Research , is a state -of-the-art molecul ar biology and phytochemistry laboratory working in collaboration with the natural products industry and other academic institutions to develop new products and improve existing botanical therapeutics grounded in herbalism's rich tradition through scientif ic exploration. SCNM is one of only five accredited schools of naturopathic medicine in the United States and the first medical school in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The College offers a four -year, professional -level Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) program, a Master of Science in Clinical Nutrition, and non -degree coursework. The College has become a respected source of evidence -based, holistic, and scientific approaches to healing and wellness with the help of high -quality administration, faculty , and staff working to create public engagement and increase knowledge throughout the community. SCNM is approved by the Arizona Board for Private Post -Secondary Education and is accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education, the accrediting a gency for naturopathic colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. In addition, SCNM is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Page 12 :: SCNM Commencement Ceremony The academic costumes worn in the procession of today's commencement trace their origin to those worn by faculty and students at medieval European universities. With only minor modifications, these costumes have remained largely unchanged since the 16th century. Stand ards for colleges and universities in the United States were established in 1895 with the adoption of an intercollegiate code, which specifies design and color appropriate for various degrees. As in medieval times, the costumes worn on formal academic occa sions denote the wearer's academic heritage. The modern academic costume consists of three parts: the gown or robe, a headpiece, and a hood. The doctoral gown is full flowing and has large, bell -shaped sleeves. It is trimmed with velvet panels down the fro nt and has velvet chevrons on the sleeves. The headpiece or cap is worn with a tassel. For the doctor's degree only, the cap should be velvet. The tassel should be black with the exception of the doctor's cap that may have a tassel of gold. While the gown and headpiece denote the wearer's level of education, it is the hood which adds meaning and dimension to the academic costume. Changed little since medieval times, the hood is worn falling from the shoulders down the back of the gown in a display of vivid colors. The hood's velvet edging denotes the degree's branch of learning . For ND students, this is green for medicine. For MS students, this is gold for nutrition. The hood is also lined with the official colors of the institution conferring the degree, and the lining is worn exposed. SCNM hoods are lined with navy blue and teal.
