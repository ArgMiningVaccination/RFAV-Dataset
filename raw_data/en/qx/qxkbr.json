{"title": "A Case Report: Long Post-COVID Vaccination Syndrome During the Eleven Months After the Third Moderna Dose", "author": "Josef Finsterer", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "It is undisputed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can have side effects. Long post-COVID vaccination syndrome (LPCVS) is one of them and is often neglected. It persists 11 months after the third mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine dose has not been reported. Our patient is a 39-year-old male with a largely uneventful previous history who developed severe adverse reactions immediately after the third dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. In addition to brief fever, headache, flickering eyes, skin rashes, tiredness, disorientation, dizziness (brain fog), tiredness, impaired thinking and concentration, and emotional disorders occurred as a result. Cerebral MRI showed non-specific white matter lesions in a frontotemporal distribution. Some of the immune parameters were deflected. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, sartans, and statins have occasionally provided temporary relief. In conclusion, LPCVS is a definite complication of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and can severely impact the quality of life and lead to disability. Despite extensive work-up, a clear cause for the long-term neuro-cognitive deficits cannot be identified. Symptomatic treatment can provide some relief. Patients with LPCVS should be taken seriously and treated appropriately.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-12-12", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
