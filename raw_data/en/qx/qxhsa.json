The application for the Fall 2024 Traditional BSN program and the HESI A2 exam are now available! About the Traditional BSN Program The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program aims to prepare graduates as generalist nurses to provide holistic, personalized care that addresses the healthcare needs of diverse individuals, families, communities, and populations across the lifespan. Track Description Our college motto underpins the BSN curriculum's three overarching concepts: CARE, LEAD, INSPIRE. Care is the understanding and capability to provide what is necessary for the health, welfare, maintenance, and protection of patients and patient/family/population systems and is the basis for personalized nursing care and nurses' clinical judgment. Lead embodies the actions, skills, and competencies the professional nurse employs to deliver care in the increasingly complex healthcare system. Inspire encompasses the nurses' creative energy toward innovations that transform practice by using self and others. The curriculum is logically organized from simple to complex so that students acquire a professional nurse's cognitive, affective, and technical competencies. Courses in the first two semesters focus on foundational knowledge and principles of personalized nursing care. Students understand the context of contemporary nursing practice, the meaning of professionalism, ethical and legal guidelines, professional values, and standards of professional nursing practice. Course content and concepts are aligned with clinical experiences to develop beginning clinical reasoning. Students acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to provide evidence-based, safe, cost-effective quality care to achieve optimal health outcomes. Courses in the final two semesters build upon prior learning and are characterized by increased complexity in content and outcomes. Students enhance clinical reasoning and critical thinking through nursing practice in various settings for individuals across the lifespan, families and other groups, and communities. Learning experiences are designed to enable students to demonstrate leadership, interprofessional collaboration, and advocacy skills that improve the health of diverse individuals and populations. In the final semester, students participate in a project to develop an innovative solution for a problem or issue relevant to professional nursing. Please Note: Students who have a Bachelor's or Master's degree in a subject unrelated to nursing are only eligible for the [Accelerated BSN program](https://nursing.ufl.edu/programs/bachelor-of-science-bsn/accelerated-bsn/), not the Traditional BSN. Curriculum and Coursework Nursing courses include classroom and laboratory activities alongside supervised clinical practice experiences. Students can analyze various issues in professional nursing practice and health care. They are introduced to a basic understanding of how evidence is developed, the research process, and clinical reasoning. Students will develop skills in managing patients from various backgrounds and cultures. The program moves through the continuum of care and the spectrum of complexity in the clinical setting.
