Acupuncture calms the mind and body and minimizes the symptoms associated with the detox at hand, such as cravings, anxiety, and stress. Lasting results are the most effective with consistent weekly acupuncture sessions for some length of time, which varies. Are you considering a detox, a cleanse, or a lifestyle change? Perhaps you want to stop smoking, lose weight, or begin a fast. Adding acupuncture to your detox plan helps your body to function more efficiently by giving you more energy, reducing stress, and curbing cravings. Acupuncture can help your body and mind to more easily adjust to the sometimes intense, quick changes that are brought upon by a detox. Acupuncture activates your body's own natural healing mechanism to aid in balancing the body and mind; to jumpstart this process more frequent acupuncture treatments are recommended during the beginning stages of a detox. Detoxing is quite common these days and most likely you, or someone you know, has been on some form of detox diet or cleanse. Generally, detoxing is associated with a cleansing, typically of the body and mind, related to particular habits, such a smoking or alcohol, diet or overall lifestyle change. Detoxing can be as basic as the removal of a single food group from your diet, such as dairy; it can also be the ceasing of habits such as the use of drugs or alcohol. Smoking cessation, drugs or alcohol withdrawal, weight loss and dieting, cleanses, and fasting all fall under the category of detoxification. Acupuncture assists with side effects stemming from detoxification. Depending on your current state of health, diet, exercise regimen, and stress level, the intensity of side effects will vary from mild to intense. Detox can be a shock to your system as your body expels built up toxins; side effects can manifest as headache, fatigue, anxiety, stress, muscle pain, nausea, lightheadedness, gas and bloating, constipation or diarrhea, and sleep disruption, among others. Studies have shown that acupuncture effectively provides reduction in cravings and assists with relief from withdrawal symptoms by releasing endorphins in the brain that benefit mood and alleviate stress, which help the individual to better manage the detox symptoms. And as a whole body medicine acupuncture treats more than just your detox symptoms; you could see improvement with sleep, better mood, improved digestion, and even clearer skin. It is important to note that as effective as acupuncture is for assisting with detoxification, it is a supportive tool that helps to empower the individual to improve upon their own particular issue. Receiving acupuncture treatment alone without putting in the personal effort to improve will lead to less than optimal treatment results. This is why individuals need to decide for themselves to quit smoking, lose weight, etc. - they need to be ready to do the personal work to succeed, only then will acupuncture be a truly effective detox tool. White Lotus recommends a course of treatment from 4 to 8 weeks, twice per week; the severity of symptoms determines the necessary length of treatment. Twice weekly sessions are highly recommended during the initial stages of detox when symptoms are the most pronounced. Weekly sessions can begin once the detox has leveled off and the individual feels stronger and more comfortable with their present state of body and mind. And finally, once detox is complete, we encourage a monthly maintenance session to help sustain your achieved health results.
