Meditation is simple. In fact, one of the most difficult things about it is that it is so simple. Most people tend to think it should be more difficult or involve more effort... and so they don't think they're doing it correctly, and they quit doing it. Active meditations involve a very [subtle energy](https://themindfulword.org/2014/soba-rigpa-health/), directed by the imagination. Don't work at it too hard; play with it and have fun with it. You'll find it's easy to create experiences in your inner field of vision\u2014and once you do, you start to see the results of those inner visions in the outer world. You'll remember these inner guided voyages as vividly as you remember all the other experiences in your life. Here's a meditation, based on a simple truth that many people don't realize. If it were understood by more people, it would have a great effect on the world. This understanding in itself can be a direct path, something that can help you take quantum leaps in your evolution. We have the power within us\u2014in our mind, our imagination\u2014to open up and activate every energy centre in our body. Our bodies have many different energy centres, of course\u2014chakra is the Sanskrit word for these energy centres\u2014and in most people, one or more is blocked somewhat, so that energy isn't really moving freely through the whole being. Most people tend to focus their physical and emotional energy on one or two centres, simply out of habit and [ early conditioning](https://themindfulword.org/2012/i-am-that-choice). In the traditional teachings of India, there are seven major chakras, and several minor ones. In the traditional teachings of the West (such as Kabbala), five major energy centres are described. It doesn't matter specifically how you choose to break them down. The teaching is essentially the same, at its roots. Each chakra is a physical and emotional centre of energy; each one corresponds to a major hormonal gland in the body. It's worthwhile to take the time to explore each one of them. There's a good chance that you've been ignoring a few, or holding a lot of tension and stress in them, which can lead to physical and emotional problems if that tension isn't released.
