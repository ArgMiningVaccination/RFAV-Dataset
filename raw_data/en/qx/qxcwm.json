Kristen adored them both. Her mother was, in Kristen's eyes, a saint, having worked two jobs as a single mom to not only raise both girls, but also put them through college. And Carly was that great older sister, always supportive, helping Kristen with her math homework when mom was working the night shift at a local restaurant. Carly graduated from East Texas State University four years ago, was married, had a four-year-old son Ian, and was a successful graphic artist in Dallas. Kristen herself completed a BA degree in marketing last year, worked as a sales manager for Time-Warner Cable in Austin, was also happily married, and had a 14- month-old daughter named Alissa. The monthly \"girls' day out\" was an excuse for the three women to celebrate the love and commitment that helped them through the difficult times when Anne was working 80 hours a week and Carly was helping care for Kristen. The monthly brunches were also an opportunity for Carly's and Kristen's husbands to bond with their own young children, who (although Anne loved them dearly) were not invited to the brunches. The last gathering, however, had been strained. Following Kristen's graduation, Anne courageously tackled her lifelong dream and enrolled in a nursing program at East Texas State. After the first year of course work, Anne was near the top of her class. \"Not bad,\" thought Kristen, \"for a 50-year-old ex-waitress from Fort Worth.\" Anne's increasing expertise in health issues made her, once again, a resource for the entire clan, as Ian had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) just four months after his first birthday. Autism can take a heavy toll on a family, especially those with children exhibiting the most extreme form of the disease. Ian unfortunately was in this group\u2014regressing from a happy and interactive one-year-old to a toddler who was completely unresponsive to his parents, and whose long bouts of repetitive rocking were interspersed with brief but intense periods of uncontrollable aggression and self-abuse. Anne's genuine love for her daughters and grandchildren, coupled with her access to the medical school's library, made her a knowledgeable and compassionate counsel for Carly. Two seemingly random events led to an uncharacteristic and heated exchange at their last gathering. Anne was taking a course in microbiology, and Carly had stumbled onto an episode of \"Larry King Live\" while channel surfing. Kristen was running late. When she was directed to a patio table to join her mother and sister, she found them engaged in the same battle left unresolved a month ago. "}
