The Physical Sciences ResearchDivision plays a vital role in our nation's economic and general health by carefully selecting, fund-ing, and supporting scientists across the country. It also serves as an important link in the interna-tional endeavors that are the hallmark of America's space program. By disseminating knowledge and transferring technology among private industries, univer- sities, and other government agencies, the Physical Sciences Research Division continues to buildon a foundation of professional success, which is evidenced by the number of publications and con-ferences attended, while reaching out to encompass the populace at large. Educational outreach andtechnology transfer are among the program's top goals, making the benefits of NASA's researchavailable to the American public. Space shuttle research missions, as well as experiments performedin short-duration microgravity facilities, are yielding new understandings about our world and theuniverse around us, while long-duration microgravity science on the International Space Station ismaking possible advances in research that were not possible before. Under the direction of the Biological and Physical Research Enterprise, the Physical Sciences Research Division will continue to advance cutting-edge research led by the best scientistsfrom across the nation.

By the close of fiscal year(FY) 2002, the three members of the Expedition 5 crewwere busy carrying out a wide range of hands-on scien-tific and technological investigations on the orbiting out-post. Fiscal years 2001 and 2002 have coincided almostexactly with the first two years of continuous humanoccupation of the ISS. During these two years, thePhysical Sciences Research (PSR) Division has beenactively participating in pioneering space-based scientificendeavors while carrying out significant programmaticreassessment and redirection. In December 2001, the first integrated annual NASA Research Announcement (NRA) for PhysicalSciences Research in the Office of Biological andPhysical Research (OBPR) was released. The NRAsolicited time-staggered submissions of research propos-als in the five traditional microgravity disciplines ofbiotechnology, combustion science, fluid physics, funda-mental physics, and materials science. In addition, a spe-cial topic for original research in the area of advancedmaterials supporting space exploration technology wasincluded in the announcement. Together with a previousspecial-topic solicitation of proposals targeting advancedmaterials characterization for high-energy radiation pro-tection, this focused request reflects a heightenedattention to applied research supporting advanced spacetechnology development. The programmatic shift fromsingle-discipline NRAs appearing every two years on avarying schedule to a fixed-date, annual NRA integratingmultiple disciplines and special topics was designed toestablish a more regular schedule for the solicitations andto enhance the opportunities for proposal submissions. The scientific accomplishments funded through NRAs in these past two years are nothing short ofimpressive, reflecting the quality and productivity of themultidisciplinary research community assembled underthe PSR Division. For example, exciting new accom-plishments obtained through both Earth- and space-basedinvestigations have allowed the growth of three-dimen-sional ovarian tissues from cells and the preservation ofimmune system cells in the NASA-developed specializedbioreactor that mimics microgravity. Combustion scien-tists have made advances in the understanding and pre-diction of smoldering combustion under normal andmicrogravity conditions. Fluid physicists have carried outrevealing new flight experiments on the ISS and thespace shuttle on colloidal crystallization, probing themysteries of phase transition and solidification, and onparticle collision in dust, simulating planetary processes. One of our bril- liant young investigators,Wolfgang Ketterle, 2001 Nobel his inspiredwork in Bose-Einsteincondensation and for hisleading role in the demon-stration of the feasibilityof the atom laser. Someof his colleagues in theprogram have attractedworldwide attention withtheir artistry in controlling Bose-Einstein condensates toslow down and completely stop the transfer of informa-tion contained in light and to simulate processes in dis-tant stars by using supercold condensates of fermions. Inmaterials science, the first ISS investigations on solidifi-cation processes using baffles in sealed ampoules weresuccessfully carried out in the Microgravity ScienceGlovebox facility, provided by the European SpaceAgency. Using the availability of extended-durationexposure to microgravity on the ISS, researchers havebeen able to grow crystals of superoxide dismutases \u2014the body's own fighter of free radicals \u2014 that are largeenough and of high enough quality to obtain the never-before-seen three-dimensional structure of the hydrogenson each amino acid of the protein. After reviewing research investigations such as these, the National Research Council Committee onMicrogravity Research released at the end of FY 2002 aglowing assessment of the progress and quality of theresearch carried out under the auspices of the previousMicrogravity Research Division and the current PhysicalSciences Research Division, praising significant pastaccomplishments and noting promising future develop-ments. In fact, the National Research Council Board onPhysics and Astronomy's assessment of the \"GrandChallenges in Physics\" for the first decade of the 21stcentury indirectly endorses a large portion of the OBPRPhysical Sciences Research Division. Armed with thesefindings, the division has embarked upon a strategic redi-rection of the research objectives that places a renewedemphasis on applied research aimed toward enablingnew space technologies while preserving the valuableand productive fundamental research component uniqueto NASA and to the country. \u2014 Eugene Trinh Director, Physical Sciences Research Division WWANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 2INTRODUCTION2 Table 1 \u2014 Physical Sciences Research Overview 200020012002 Research tasks 584 553 533 Principal investigators 455 451 449 Co-Investigators 120.0 Table 2 \u2014 Program Bibliographic Listings articles 904 688 758 Presentations 1,062 719 817 Proceedings papers 422 325 250 NASA technical briefs 13 012 Books/chapters 50 43 58 Total 2,451 1,775 1,895 Table 3 \u2014 Grant Statistics 200020012002 1,146 1,407 1,690 Degrees granted 457 N/A N/A Patents applied for 22 15 16Table 4 \u2014 Glenn Research Center Task Summary 200020012002 Ground-based 189 158 176 Flight program 55 54 46 Total 244 212 222 Table 5 \u2014 Jet Propulsion Laboratory Task Summary 20002001 2002 Ground-based 40 64 55 Flight program 9 12 11 Total 49 76 66 Table 6 \u2014 Johnson Space Center Task Summary 200020012002 Ground-based 56 49 48 Flight program 2 0 0 Total 58 49 48 Table 7 \u2014 Marshall Space Flight Center Task Summary 200020012002 Ground-based 180173144 Flight program 0.5% Materials Science 13.6% Fundamental 10.2%Fluid Physics and Transport Phenomena 11.6%Combustion Science 9.4%Biotechnology 29.0% Fundamental Physics 10.1%Fluid Physics and 11.3%Combustion 9.8%Multidiscipline / Other 22.2% Glovebox 0.1% Acceleration Measurement 0.4% Materials Science 17.1%FY 2001 Microgravity Funding Distribution by Science Discipline (Total Budget in Millions:$130.359)FY 2002 Microgravity Funding Distribution by Science Discipline (Total Budget in Millions:$120.018)ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 19Office of Biological and Physical Research FY 2001 Total Investigations by State 53 4 1731 45 12 1 24 14 7 10618 35177 59 46 59 10 42 7 5 615 113 104 47 143 3021MA-75 312 RI-7 CT-12 NJ-31 DE-40 DC-11MD-40 992 Flight and Ground Research Programs in 44 States and the District of Columbia *Excludes Graduate Student Research ProjectsUnited States (AK & HI Inset) by State Totals* 17 to 173 (16) 11 to 16 (7) 1 to 4 (11)5 to 9 (9)10 (2) 20Office of Biological and Physical Research FY 2002 Total Investigations by State 63 1 1661 45 10 3 24 9 6 11318 30176 58 44 53 14 47 5 614 114 124 42 163 2819MA-71 212 RI-7 CT-13 NJ-16 DE-5 DC-11MD-38 947 Flight and Ground Research Programs in 44 States and the District of Columbia *Excludes Graduate Student Research ProjectsUnited States (AK & HI Inset) by State Totals* 20 to 166 (12) 13 to 19 (9) 1 to 4 (11)5 to 6 (7)7 to 12 (5)2INTRODUCTIOid you ever stop to consider that some of the foods in your refrigerator are products of biotech-nology? Biotechnology is the application of knowl-edge concerning biological systems to the productionof consumer goods and services. Foods like cheese,yogurt, and beer are all products of biotechnology inits most basic form \u2014 harnessing existing biologicalprocesses, such as bacterial fermentation, to producegoods for human consumption. The term biotechnology probably also brings to mind genetically engineered bacteria, plants, andanimals. It is this facet of biotechnology that allowsfarmers to plant crops that can withstand certain herbicides or diseases and helps researchers todevelop bacteria that can produce human insulin,which is essential for the treatment of diabetes, anddrugs to dissolve blood clots, reducing the risk ofheart attack and stroke. Although most biotechnology research bene- fits the medical and agricultural fields, this kind ofwork also supports a broad range of manufacturingindustries. Processes that use biological components or that mimic biological systems can be used for avariety of purposes, including creating new materi-als, removing contaminants, and improving the effi-ciency of chemical reactions. For example, microbesare used to process sewage at city wastewater treat-ment plants and to produce alcohol-based fuels formotorized vehicles. Bacteria that can break down oil ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 4DDBIOTECHNOLOGY3 OVERVIEW Farmers have benefit- ed from biotechnologyby being able to growhigh-yield crops thatare to herbi-cides disease.Harnessing biotech-nology has allowedthe agricultural indus-try to produce moreon fewer acres. Biotechnology has enabled scientists toturn to naturalsources for pollutioncontrol. REPORT 2001-2002and petroleum have been discovered, and researchers have genetically altered these bacteria to create microbes that can feed on oil slicks. Biotechnology research focuses on how organisms and their components function. Largeorganisms are composed of systems of organs. Ifyou look in the mirror, you can see the largest organin the human body \u2014 the skin. The skin and otherorgans consist of tissues specialized to perform spe-cific functions in the body. These tissues in turn aremade up of a smaller structure \u2014 the cell. How thecell functions in a particular tissue is determined byits molecular components. Cells contain billions ofbiological macromolecules, which are much largerand more complex than nonbiological molecules.The unique chemical traits of these molecules deter-mine how a cell differentiates to become part of aparticular type of tissue and, ultimately, how an organism grows, lives, and dies. The microgravity environment of space provides special advantages to biotechnologyresearchers studying cell growth and biological mol-ecules. NASA's microgravity biotechnology pro-gram, therefore, supports research in two mainareas: macromolecular biotechnology, overseen byMarshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville,Alabama, and cell science, overseen by Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The program'scontributions to understanding the foundations oflife at the molecular and cellular levels may enablethe development of new drugs and other therapiesfor disease and dysfunction, as well as measuresto safely send humans into space for extendedtime periods.OVERVIEW3BIOTECHNOLOG Cheese is a product of biotechnology. Bacteriaproduce lactic acid to aidcurd formation and influ-ence the the enzymeused to accelerate cheesecurd formation.here are tens of thousands of biological macromolecules at work in the human body. Thesemolecules, mostly proteins and nucleic acids, per-form or regulate all functions that maintain life.Proteins, for example, transport oxygen and chemi-cals in the blood, form major components of muscleand skin, and, in the form of antibodies, aid in fight-ing infection. Enzymes, which are a class of pro-teins, catalyze specific chemical reactions in cellsand control metabolic pathways, which are a seriesof chemical reactions that together perform one ormore important functions, like the conversion ofsugar to energy. Nucleic acids are another type of biological macromolecule. The best-known examples of nucleicacids are ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonu-cleic acid (DNA). Nucleotides, which are subunitsof nucleic acids, exist in a particular order along theDNA molecule. Each unit of three nucleotides alonga strand of DNA forms a \"letter\" of the geneticcode, with the letters specifying particular aminoacids, the building blocks of proteins. So each sec-tion of the genetic code actually specifies the pro-duction of a specific protein, which in turn supportsthe maintenance of life at both the cellular and whole-organism levels. Small differences in geneticcodes can result in major differences within andbetween organisms. To unlock some of the mysteries about how a biological molecule carries out its role, scientistsneed knowledge of the molecule's structure. A bio-logical molecule's shape and chemical componentsdetermine the types of other molecules with which itcan interact. Proteins have active sites that allowthem to fit with other molecules to perform a specif-ic function. Active sites on proteins, when inappro-priately triggered, can cause disease or unwantedfunctions. Drug designers seek knowledge of thesesites so they can develop drugs to block the sites orotherwise render them inactive. OVERVIEW ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 6TTMACROMOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY3 Proteins are the building blocks of our bodies and the living world around us. If the structure of a protein is known, then companiescan develop new or improved drugs to fight the disease of whichthe protein is a part. On Earth, convection currents, sedimenta-tion, and other gravity-induced phenomena hamper crystalgrowth efforts, and the result is crystals with flaws, as shown onthe left. In microgravity, researchers can grow high-quality crys-tals in an environment free of these effects to obtain better quali-ty crystals that yield more structural data, as shown on the right.Research on crystals of human insulin, like these, could lead toimproved treatments for diabetes. credit: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002Information about molecular structure is important to scientists in other fields as well.Genetic engineers use this information to chemicallyalter genetic codes to make bacteria, plants, or fungiwith desirable properties, such as yeast that has beenaltered to produce insulin. Knowledge of molecularstructure is also the key to understanding how somespecies survive and even thrive in extreme condi- tions like the arctic or in volcanic vents. Andbecause some biological molecules, such asenzymes, catalyze processes, understanding theirstructure may enable their use as miniature manu-facturing plants to process materials \u2014 the ultimatein nanotechnology. X-ray crystallography is the most common method by which scientists study the structure ofbiological molecules. Crystals of the molecule ofinterest are formed, and X-rays are passed through asingle crystal at various angles. The resulting dif-fraction patterns are analyzed using computers toestimate the size, shape, and structure of the mole-cule. A flawed crystal will yield a blurry and/orweak diffraction pattern, whereas a well-orderedcrystal will yield a sharp and/or strong diffractionpattern and thus useful information about the struc-ture of the crystal. A microgravity environment reduces the effects of fluid flows and sedimentation within thecrystallization solution that can interfere with thecrystal growth process and the quality of the crystal.OVERVIEW3MACROMOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLO3 This unusually large cubic crystal of satellite tobacco mosaic virus grown under microgravity conditions is more than 30 times the size ofsimilar crystals grown on Earth.credit: NASAWhen a crystal begins to form in a solution, mole- cules diffuse from the solution around the crystal tojoin the growing crystal lattice. As a result, the solu-tion in the immediate vicinity of the crystal has alower concentration of the crystal-forming materialthan the remainder of the solution, and therefore hasa lower density. Under the influence of Earth's grav-ity, this difference in density creates currents next tothe growing crystal. Such fluid flows can alter theorientation and position of the biological moleculesadded to the crystal lattice, thereby creating disorderin the crystal. Molecules are added to the crystal lat-tice in the same way on Earth and in microgravity,but in microgravity the lower concentration at thecrystal surface can slow crystal growth enough toenable misplaced crystals to disassociate and thenreattach in a better orientation. Likewise, sedimentation, another effect of gravity, can result in poor-quality crystals. Whencrystals grow to a size that cannot be supported bysuspension in the drop of solution in which the crys-tals are forming, then the crystals will drift to thebottom of the drop. There they may settle on top ofother crystals and grow into those adjacent crystals.X-ray crystallography requires single crystals for analysis, and thus sedimentation can render poten-tially high-quality crystals unusable. In the micro-gravity environment of low Earth orbit, the effectsof sedimentation and fluid flow are nearly eliminated,and the conditions for growing diffraction-qualitycrystals are improved. Ground-based research in molecular science includes crystallization of biological macromole-cules (including analysis of crystals and methods tocontrol crystal quality); the development of bioma-terials, which are substances that are synthetic ornatural in origin that can be used to treat, augment,or replace a tissue, organ, or function of the body;research on separation technology; and biologicallyoriented nanotechnology.

Studying thestructure of enzymes will help researchers to betterunderstand how the enzymes function. Creatinekinase, pictured here, converts the major storageform of high energy phosphate into a usable energyform. Creatine kinase is a major muscle enzyme andis implicated in some muscle diseases.

The goals of the initiative are to accel-erate the process by which investigators get their researchprojects to flight, to decrease the time interval betweendeveloping a research idea and obtaining data, and to match the speed of the ground-based researchprocess. To achieve these goals, the biotechnology pro- gram will integrate new hardware for use on theInternational Space Station (ISS) that will allow increasedsample throughput and provide video microscopy of crys-tallization experiments. Also in response to the NRCpanel, the biotechnology program began developing andtesting an external review process that will accommodateboth large-scale research projects funded by NASA'speer-reviewed grant process and small-scale ad-hocinvestigations. An external, nonadvocate panel will beused to peer-review and prioritize experiments and tomake decisions in a timely manner to better match thepace of ground-based biotechnology research. This pro-gram will provide the scientific community with one,well-advertised point of contact for access to spaceflightexperiments.

The NASA Research Announcement (NRA) for macromolecular and cellular biotechnology that wasreleased in August 2000 directly addressed the recom-mendations of the NRC report. Research proposals in anumber of areas, detailed in the following paragraphs,were solicited from scientists. Proposals were sought for structural biology research to produce crystals of macromolecular assem-blies with important implications for cutting-edge biolo-gy problems, as recommended by the NRC. Systems thatmeet the criteria set forth in the NRA include membraneproteins, molecular motors, and biopolymer syntheticmachinery. The NRC report described all of these sys-tems as elaborate and fragile, which makes them difficultto crystallize except under optimal conditions. In thesecases, microgravity conditions might improve the qualityof the crystals enough to allow determination of keystructures. Also included were macromolecular systems for which research efforts have already been undertakenbut which have presented challenges for crystallization.In the area of crystallization studies and technologies,proposals were invited to support the aforementionedresearch with emphasis on providing a framework forunderstanding microgravity crystallization results, opti-mizing crystal growth conditions, characterizing crystaldefect formation and the relationship between defectformation and crystal growth, and providing a morerational approach to the growth of macromolecularcrystals. NASA also invited proposals for developing technologies that seek to improve macromolecular crys-tallization throughput for structural biology and pro-teomics research on the ISS. Proteomics is the identifica-tion and study of proteins in the body, genes that codefor particular proteins, protein-protein interactions, andthe role of proteins in such activities as transmitting dis-ease. Research for improving throughput includes auto-mated crystal growth technologies, screening methods,and cryopreservation techniques. In the area of biological nanotechnology, NASA sought research proposals for the development of molecular-sized sensors, signalers, and receptors; nanometer-scalebiomaterials; and technologies to manipulate biomole-cules to form useful devices or nanometer-scale struc-tures. Nanotechnology research is important because itcan be used to reduce experiments' weight, volume, andneed for electrical power, all limiting factors duringspace missions. Research solicited in the area of biomolecular self-assembling materials includes polymer biosynthesis,self-assembled monolayers and multilayers, structures, and bio-mineralization. area of biomolecular self-assemblingmaterials combines molecular biology, physical sciences,and materials engineering. Biomolecular materials haveability to assemble themselves without external interven-tion, and understanding the mechanisms involved in suchself-assembly could lead to the development of newprocesses and materials with significant technologicalimpact, including applications in life support to enablehumans to live and work permanently in space, as wellas other Office of Biological and Physical Research(OBPR) goals. Finally, in the area of structural protein-based materials, NASA solicited proposals for the production * The NRC was organized by the National Academy of Sciences to associate the science and technology communities and to be the p rincipal operating agency that provides services to the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities. These se rvices include investigating, examining, experimenting, and reporting on any subject of science or art.ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 10MACROMOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY3 of protein-based materials or the isolation, in useable form, of such materials from cells. Collagen, keratin,and silk are examples of structural proteins. Researchersmay be able to incorporate novel properties in suchmaterials by genetically engineering the sequences orincorporating modular components from other proteins.Because these materials could be produced usingrecombinant DNA technology, it is possible to create auniform and controllable architecture of the resultingmaterial. Such biomaterials could also support OBPRgoals. Notices of intent for this NRA were due on September 6, 2000, and 225 proposals were received bythe October 27, 2000, due date. Selections were made inJune 2001; 20 of the selected proposals were to conductresearch in macromolecular biotechnology, includingprojects on challenging problems in structural biology,artificial biomembranes, and membrane proteins. Foradditional information on the NRA and selections, visithttp://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_u/nra/current/NRA-00-HEDS-03/winners.html on the WWW. NASA macromolecular biotechnology principal investigators (PIs), co-investigators, guest investigators,and associate investigators published 69 peer-reviewedarticles in scientific journals in fiscal year (FY) 2001 and62 in FY 2002. In early FY 2001, the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) project and NASA cosponsored a workshop inKnoxville, Tennessee. Representatives from the biologi-cal neutron diffraction and microgravity crystal growthcommunities met to discuss the future use of the SNS formacromolecular single-crystal neutron diffraction.Academic, industry, and government advisers represent-ing the countries of England, France, Japan, and theUnited States participated in the workshop and devel-oped a set of recommendations regarding biological neu-tron diffraction crystallography. Using neutrons to produce a diffraction pattern of protein crystals has advantages over X-ray diffraction.About one-half of the atoms that make up a protein arehydrogen atoms. When protein crystals are bombardedwith X-rays, the X-rays are diffracted from the electronclouds of the individual atoms within the protein crystalto form a pattern from which the structure of the proteincan be determined. But it is an incomplete picture of thestructure, because hydrogen atoms have very little elec-tron density and so go undetected by X-ray diffraction.In contrast, when a protein crystal is bombarded withneutrons, the neutrons interact with the nuclei of the pro-tein crystal atoms. The diffraction pattern of the neutronsthen allows the position of hydrogen atoms to be identi-fied, and thus a more complete structure of the proteincan be determined.However, neutron diffraction techniques pose a particular challenge. Although neutron diffraction canprovide a complete structural analysis using a singlecrystal, that crystal must be much larger than crystalsthat are suitable for X-ray analysis. The colloquium for-mally recognized that because of research supported byboth NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), theproduction of crystals sufficiently large for neutron dif-fraction studies is now an attainable goal. Growth ofcrystals 2 mm x 1.5 mm x 1 mm or larger is now com-mon for an increasing number of proteins. Based on pre-vious microgravity crystal growth experiments and theavailability of a controlled environment for extended-duration missions afforded by the ISS, it was estimatedthat approximately 90 percent of proteins crystallized inorbit will have the potential to reach 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm\u2014 the size range needed for analysis by current andfuture neutron sources. NASA was well-represented at the American Crystallographic Association's 2002 Annual Meeting,held in San Antonio, Texas, May 25-30, 2002. One-thirdof the microgravity macromolecular biotechnology pro-gram's principal investigators were key presenters at themeeting, which is the nation's largest gathering of struc-tural biologists, drawing 800 attendees in 2002. At awell-attended session, \"Biomacromolecular CrystalGrowth and Perfection,\" which was sponsored by themacromolecular biotechnology program, NASA investi-gators made six presentations that covered hardwaredevelopment, crystal quality analysis method develop-ment, and a new technique for judging the quality of thecrystal cryocooling process. Among the program presentations was a talk given by NASA Project Scientist Mark van der Woerdtitled \"About Small Streams and Shiny Rocks:Macromolecular Crystal Growth in Microfluidics.\" Vander Woerd provided an overview of work being conductedat MSFC using microfluidic technology for protein crys-tallization and reported on preliminary results from hard-ware incorporating that technology for crystal growth. Aniruddha Achari, of MSFC, and his research team presented a poster titled \"Equilibrium KineticsStudies and Crystallization Aboard the InternationalSpace Station CrystallizationApparatus for Microgravity (PCAM).\" The PCAM hasbeen used to grow crystals a micro-gravity environment using a \"sitting drop\" method ofvapor diffusion. The experiments were set up to gatherdata for a series of days of activation with differentdroplet volumes and precipitants. The results of theseexperiments will help future PCAM users to choose pre-cipitants that will optimize crystallization conditions fortheir target macromolecules for a particular mission witha known duration. ANNUAL REPORT 2001-20023MACROMOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLOG In April 2002, a patent was awarded to macro- molecular biotechnology PIs and project scientistsWilliam Witherow, of MSFC, R. L. Kurtz, of Pace andWaite Inc., Huntsville, Alabama; and R. R. Holmes, ofMSFC, for their Laser Image Contrast EnhancementSystem (LICES). LICES allows objects that are hotenough to emit blackbody radiation to be illuminated andimaged. (A blackbody is a theoretically ideal radiator andabsorber of energy at all electromagnetic wavelengths.)For example, in a furnace, an object is heated until itemits blackbody radiation. It is then illuminated fromoutside with laser light and viewed with a camera with aspecial optical system. In FYs 2001 and 2002 the macromolecular biotechnology program made progress toward optimizingthe analysis of microgravity-grown crystals by advancingtechniques for cryocooling. Rapid cooling, or cryopreser-vation, is a technique routinely used to preserve crystalsof biological molecules for structural analysis by X-raydiffraction. It is important that crystals are carefully pre-served and stored not only to remain intact for lateranalysis but also to withstand radiation damage from theintense X-rays used. Flash cooling of crystals to near 100kelvins (cryocooling) extends a crystal'slifetime and makes it less susceptible tothe secondary radiation damage thatoccurs during X-ray analysis. Cryocoolingalso reduces thermal motions of the mole-cules and allows for data collection fromvery thin or small crystals. Edward Snell, Russell Judge, and Mark van der Woerd, of MSFC, have pro-vided a method by which scientists, forthe first time, can actually see images ofthe temperature gradients as crystals ofcertain molecules are rapidly cooled.Using a camera sensitive to infrared radi-ation, the MSFC scientists determined thelength of time it took to complete the cryo-cooling process. The experiment alsodemonstrated that it is possible to observedefects created by improper cooling orhandling of the crystals. Being able toactually assess temperature distributionacross a crystal and to observe defectscaused by improper handling will helpscientists to improve crystal preservationmethods and ultimately obtain more com-plete and accurate data. The researchers presented their work on cryocooling at several venues in FY 2002, including the AmericanCrystallographic Association meeting in San Antonio. While investigatingcryocooling of crystals, Snell and van der Woerd also studied water in the macromolecular structure to under-stand how cryoprotectants interact with the crystal at themolecular level. Cryoprotectants replace water in thestructure and slow the formation of ice so that flash cool-ing the crystal vitrifies it \u2014 turns it into a glassy sub-stance \u2014 rather than freezes it. The cryoprotectants donot react with the crystal and are simply present to pro-tect the crystal from the effects of freezing. This workresulted in an invited talk in 2001, which was publishedin 2002 (\"Neutrons and Microgravity,\" by E. H. Snell, inProceedings of the 3rd International Symposium onDevelopment of New Structural Biology IncludingHydrogen and Hydration in Organized ResearchCombination System , 33-41). Complete neutron data sets have been collected to complement X-ray studies;these results will be published in 2003. Flight Experiments Three different pieces of macromolecular experi- ment hardware flew on the ISS in FYs 2001 and 2002,accommodating hundreds of macromolecular samplesthat successfully crystallized in the microgravity The structural model of thaumatin shown here was developed from information gleaned from thaumatin crystals grown in microgravity. The crystals grown in theEnhanced Gaseous Nitrogen Dewar on the International Space Station were of higherquality than any of those grown on Earth. Synchrotron studies of these crystals pro-duced 50 percent more data than had been obtained from the best ground-grown crys-tal.

Several technologies were also deployed to advance crystal studies and analysis, including real-timeimaging of crystals during in-flight growth. The first biological crystal growth experiments conducted aboard the ISS took place in the EnhancedGaseous Nitrogen (EGN) Dewar in FY 2000 and werereturned to Earth in early FY 2001. The dewar, whichwas developed by PI Alexander McPherson of theUniversity of California, Irvine, flew on three ISS mis-sions in 2001 (each lasting approximately 40 days) andcarried a total of 881 samples of macromolecules to orbitfor crystallization. In the dewar, crystals were grown using the liq- uid-liquid diffusion method. In liquid-liquid diffusionsamples, the material to be crystallized and the precipi-tant solutions are frozen separately, and then are thawedonce in orbit, diffusing with each other and resulting incrystal formation. Under microgravity conditions, crys-tals of the biomolecular materials form without interfer-ence from the container, other crystals, or turbulentflows, which often results in a crystal with a more nearperfect structure than those grown on Earth. This was the case for the dewar-grown crystals of thaumatin, which were of higher quality than any ofthis molecule grown on the ground. Thaumatin is a pro-tein from the African Serendipity berry ( Thaumatococcus danielli ) and is valued for its intensely sweet taste. NASA PI Craig Kundrot, of MSFC, grew crystals ofthaumatin using the liquid-liquid diffusion method in theEGN. Synchrotron diffraction data collected from thebest crystal extended to 1.28 angstroms and produced 50percent more data than the best ground-grown crystaland 100 percent more data than earlier reports on thau-matin crystals in scientific literature. Results of the thau-matin crystal growth investigation were published in2002 in a paper titled \"Thaumatin CrystallizationAboard the International Space Station Using Liquid-Liquid Diffusion in the Enhanced Gaseous NitrogenDewar,\" by C. L. Barnes, E. H. Snell, and C. E. Kundrot,in Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography(58), 751-60. FY 2001 also saw the transport of the Protein Crystallization Apparatus for Microgravity aboard STS-100, on April 19, 2001. PCAM had flown on 11 previousshuttle flights. PCAM, developed by Daniel Carter, ofNew Century Pharmaceuticals, and his colleagues atMSFC, is a self-contained crystal growth apparatus thatuses multiple seven-chamber trays as a disposable inter-face. The sample chambers, which each hold a drop ofprotein solution, are surrounded by a \"moat\" ofabsorbent material that controls the crystal growthprocess after activation. The wells are filled prior tolaunch and sealed with rubber to prevent evaporation and subsequent crystal formation before launch. Nine plas- tic trays can be loaded in one PCAM cylinder, and sixcylinders can be carried in a temperature-controlledlocker. For its first ISS mission, in April 2001, PCAM trays containing 756 samples of 11 different proteinswere housed in two Single-Locker Thermal EnclosureSystems. The scientific objectives of these experimentsranged from producing crystals of superior size and qual-ity for X-ray structure determination to experimentsaimed at improving understanding of the underlyingphysical processes involved in biological macromolecu-lar crystal growth in microgravity. PCAM equilibrationstudies conducted during the ISS increment produceddata that will help future users of the PCAM equipmentto optimize growth conditions for the macromolecules inwhich they are interested. One of the PCAM experiments, led by Co- Investigator Jean-Paul Declercq of the University ofLouvain, in Belgium, resulted in crystals of peroxire-doxin 5. Peroxiredoxin 5 is a protein thought to play animportant antioxidant protective role in various tissuesunder both healthy and disease states. Peroxiredoxin mayalso be important to signal transduction, or communica-tion, between cells. Crystals of the oxidized form of thisprotein grown on the ISS showed an improvement in res-olution from 7 angstroms to 3.8 angstroms. In FY 2002, PCAM flew on two space shuttle missions headed to the ISS, STS-108 in December 2001and STS-111 in June 2002. On the STS-108 mission,several proteins produced significantly larger crystalsand, in some cases, crystals that diffracted to the highestresolution to date for Earth- or space-grown crystals. Onthis flight, Carter and New Century Pharmaceuticalscrystallized human serum albumin, the major protein ofthe human circulatory system. It contributes 80 percentto osmotic blood pressure and is chiefly responsible formaintaining blood pH. Additionally, albumin is involvedwith the binding and transportation of a variety of smallmolecules throughout the circulatory system, includingthe majority of currently known pharmaceuticals.Structural details of albumin and albumin-drug com-plexes can be used to explore the potential for improvingthe safety and efficacy of a broad base of therapeuticsand for developing novel engineered albumins for a vari-ety of applications. The highest resolution and qualitynative data to date on human serum albumin crystalswere collected from one of the crystals grown on theISS. Data were collected at a resolution of 1.9 angstroms,and these data indicated that even higher resolution datashould be obtainable. Co-Investigator Mark Wardell, of REPORT 2001-20023MACROMOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLO which controls blood coagulation in human plasma and is an important target for understanding strokes andthrombolytic diseases, which include deep vein thrombo-sis, pulmonary embolism, and cerebral infarction. Thefirst few ISS crystals analyzed have shown diffraction toat least 1.8 angstroms, with an overall completeness ofmore than 95 percent. As with the human serum albumincrystals, even higher resolution data may be obtainablefrom the antithrombin crystals. A detailed analysis of theimproved structure is currently under way and will bepublished in the future. Another goal that was achievedduring PCAM experiments flown to the ISS on STS-108was the exploratory growth of crystals with a definedinternal symmetry, called a space group, and morphologysuitable for neutron diffraction. Carter's PCAM experi-ment was geared toward proof of concept for this pro-tein/space group combination as a prelude for the morecostly-to-prepare samples that are currently aboard theISS. Neutron diffraction experiments are performedusing specialized nuclear reactors and require unusuallylarge crystals, which can be difficult to grow. The re-searcher's efforts, if successful, can be rewarded withan exceptional view into the hydrogen arrangementwithin the protein molecule \u2014 a key to understandingmany of the chemical processes that underlie a protein'sfunction. The Dynamically Controlled Protein Crystal Growth (DCPCG) experiment flew on the ISS in FY2001. The DCPCG hardware was developed by theCenter for Biophysical Sciences and Engineering at theUniversity of Alabama, Birmingham. The hardware isthe first of its kind to allow the study of the physics ofthe biological crystal growth process. The DCPCG design includes a laser light scattering system that will be used toattempt to automatically detect the onset of nucleation,when the crystal begins to form. Microscopic high-resolu tion video cameras provide constant monitoring of crystal growth. Carried to the station on STS-104 in July 2001, the DCPCG allowed, for the first time, dynamic controlover crystal growth. This was accomplished through theability to vary the rate of evaporation of the crystalliza-tion experiments using computers from the ground. Thiswas also the first microgravity payload that allowedautomated imaging of the crystal experiments inprogress. V ideo images were collected every four hours and transmitted to Earth at a minimum of once each day. During operation of the DCPCG, half the chambers wereactivated and the experiments were monitored.Experiment conditions for the second half of the experi-ments were changed from the ground on the basis of theinformation obtained from the first set of chambers. Theremote control and imaging capability of the DCPCGpermitted scientists to observe two important phenomenaregarding crystallization in microgravity: the effect ofevaporation rates on crystal formation and the occur-rence of significant movement of the crystals in solution. Although differences in diffraction results between ground- and microgravity-grown crystals of thetwo model proteins flown in DCPCG were not statisti-cally significant, the microgravity samples, having aslower evaporation rate, grew fewer and larger proteincrystals. The ability to see the samples every four hours This series of images taken by Delta-L of one of 10 glucose isomerase crystals imaged automatically at 1.5-hour intervals can help give researchers insight into how growth rate dispersion can affect crystal growth and quality.credit: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 14MACROMOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY3 gave some very intriguing results regarding crystal movement, which was much more pronounced in themicrogravity environment of the ISS than had beenanticipated. It is not yet clear to what extent this move-ment was due to Marangoni effects, caused by convec-tion that occurs as the result of surface tension differ-ences, and what may have been the result of accelera-tions from various ISS activities. It is also not knownwhether the movement is a disadvantage to crystalgrowth \u2014 although it may be detrimental to ultimatecrystal quality, it may also help to grow larger crystalvolumes by moving the growing crystals into areas offresh nutrient. Engineers and scientists at MSFC have teamed to produce award-winning flight hardware namedDelta-L. This equipment, which will fly on the ISS inlate 2003, is expected to provide data that will test thehypothesis that growth rate dispersion plays a role incrystal quality improvement in microgravity. Growth rate dispersion is an occurrence in which individual crys-tals grow at slightly different growth rates under thesame solution conditions. MSFC scientists participatingin the study believe that microgravity may act to improvecrystal quality by reducing growth rate dispersion. Areduction in dispersion has been shown to be an indicatorof quality crystals on the ground. The Delta-L experiment comprises a fluid assem- bly that allows crystallization fluid in the growth cell tobe exchanged, thereby providing fresh growth solution to enable continued crystal growth; a data acquisitionand control system; and an imaging system that allowsimages of crystals to be collected by using a videomicroscope camera.

Highlights Understanding How Antioxidants Pr otect the Body Few people look forward to aging, and history is full of stories of searches for a \"fountain of youth.\"Theories abound as to why and how aging happens. Oneof the more popular of these theories states that aging isdue to DNA and other cellular structures being damagedby a class of molecules known as free radicals. The bodyhas its own defenders against free radicals, and NASAPrincipal Investigator Gloria Borgstahl, of the Universityof Toledo, is using space-grown crystals to discover howone of these \"antioxidants\" works. Free radicals are produced in the body during oxidation, the reaction of oxygen with other molecules,which is a necessary chemical reaction that provides theenergy to maintain life. A free radical has an unpairedelectron in its outer orbital shell that is highly reactiveand wants to pair with another electron to gain a morestable state. This electron makes free radicals very unsta-ble. By reacting rapidly with nearby molecules, theunpaired electron is able to pair off with another elec-tron, but the result is yet another unpaired electron,which leads to a kind of chain reaction of free radicals.The role of antioxidants is to react with free radicals, thereby stopping their chain reaction and pre-venting damage to molecules that are importantto biochemical processes in the body. The aging body somehow loses its ability to provide the necessary antioxidants toprotect vital biochemical processes from oxi-dation and the production of free radicals andbecomes subject to various aging-related prob-lems such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer,and Parkinson's disease. Free radicals can alsoreact with fatty acids in the body to make themmore saturated and can cause cross-linking ofprotein molecules. One of the best-knownresults of this type of cross-linking is theappearance of wrinkles and the loss of elastic-ity in skin as we age. Borgstahl is studying the antioxidant called superoxide dismutases (SOD), whichprotects the body from damagethat is associated with aging. SODs are impor-tant enzymes that protect all living cells byreacting with the toxic superoxide radical, anoxygen molecule with a negative chargebecause of an extra electron, which is a normal by-prod- uct of respiration, the oxidation or burning of fuel withincells. The ultimate goal of Borgstahl's research is to study the chemistry of SOD at the atomic level as it performs its job of detoxifying superoxides. She and her team hope that high-quality crystals of this enzymegrown in microgravity will help advance the understand-ing of how SOD works and will enable several types oftechnically challenging structure determinations.Although a naturally occurring manganese-containingform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) \u2014 the specificenzyme Borgstahl is working with \u2014 has been exten-sively studied biochemically, the crystal structure of this This microgravity-grown MnSOD crystal is pink due to the manganesemetal ion in the active site. Earth-grown crystals typically grow as thinplates and are never thick enough toallow the viewer to see this vibrantpink color.credit: Gloria Borgstahl According to one popular theory, aging is due to DNA and other cellular struc- tures' being damaged by a class of molecules known as free radicals. The bodyhas it own defenders against free radicals, including superoxide dismutases(SODs). PI Gloria Borgstahl hopes that high-quality crystals of MnSOD grownin microgravity, pictured here, will help advance the understanding of howSODs work and will enable several types of technically challenging structuredeterminations. credit: Gloria BorgstahlANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 16MACROMOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY3 been solved. MnSOD and other metal SODs are part of the cell's defense against free radi-cal-mediated damage. MnSOD also protects against theproduction of free radicals during inflammatory pro-cesses in the body. Borgstahl's first microgravity crystallization experiments on the manganese-containing SODs weretransported to the ISS by STS-108 in December 2001and were returned to Earth in April 2002. At AdvancedPhoton Source in Chicago, Illinois, Borgstahl and hercolleagues were able to collect the best X-ray diffractiondata available to date from the crystals grown on the ISS.Crystals grown in Earth laboratories are typically longrectangular rods that are thin in cross section (120microns x 50 microns x 1,000 microns). To the researchteam's great satisfaction, all 35 crystallization experi-ments on the ISS produced crystals, and more than halfof them were of a dramatically larger volume in crosssection (400 microns x 400 microns x 3,000 microns)than similar crystals grown on Earth. Several of theMnSOD crystals grown on the ISS were 80 timesgreater in crystal volume than Earth-grown crystals,and diffraction spots to 1.26-angstrom resolution wereobserved, providing significantly improved data com-pared with that obtained from crystals grown in Earthlaboratories. Borgstahl has said that the difference incrystal size was \"like comparing toothpicks to 4-inch x 4-inch planks of wood.\" To answer fundamental biochemical questions concerning this enzyme, Borgstahl and her team neededto obtain these large, high-quality crystals of SOD forneutron studies and for time-resolved Laue studies. Bothneutron and Laue methods require large (greater than1 cubic millimeter), perfect crystals. With the neutronexperiment, the researchers hope to be able to obtain thenever-before-seen, three-dimensional structure of thehydrogens on each amino acid of the protein and therebyanswer the unsolved questions concerning the source ofthese hydrogens in the enzyme reaction mechanism.With the time-resolved Laue experiments, the team will be able to generate the superoxide substrate within the crystals with a laser pulse and then make a\"movie\" of the enzyme converting it to peroxide andwater. The role of manganese-containing SODs in the body is important, and in-depth study of their structure isnot only vital to understanding their function, but alsomay lead to new therapeutic treatments for variousdegenerative processes. Stamp-Sized Laboratories for Space Just as the world of electronics was reshaped by the philosophy that \"smaller is better,\" biotechnologysystems are being transformed by the drive to miniaturize. The result is the production of tiny biological laborato-ries on the scale of microns and millimeters. The func-tion of several pieces of standard laboratory equipmentand a lab technician can now be replaced with a postagestamp-sized \"lab-on-a-chip.\" The science of microflu-idics is making this new technology possible as itrequires the ability to manipulate processes that involvefluid volumes measured in nanoliters (10 -9L) and pico- liters (10-12L). In the life sciences, microfluidic systems may be used for biochemical assays, genetic analysis,drug screening, electrochromatography (separating the components of a substance by applying a voltage),and blood-cell separation/analysis (to determine bloodcell counts and the presence of disease), reducing thetime and cost of performing complex biochemicalprocesses. NASA has also recognized the potential of these chips to process samples of macromolecules for crystalgrowth experiments in space. The tiny chips couldgreatly minimize the volume of valuable biological sam- ples required to obtain results. With this objective, in late2001, a collaboration began between NASA's IterativeBiological Crystallization (IBC) project and CaliperTechnologies Corporation of Mountain View, California,the renowned mass producer of LabChip\u00ae devices. Theresult is chip NS374. In future space travel, miniaturized systems will be essential for reducing spacecraftsystem mass and volume. The functions ofseveral laboratory instruments can now beplaced on a chip that is not much largerthan a dime. The size of the chips greatlyminimizes the volume of valuable biologicalsamples that must be used to obtainresults, and the automated equipment thatmanages the chips allows scientists onEarth to use the Internet to set up and trackcrystallization experiments on the ISS. credit: NASAACTUAL CHIPANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002In any experiment, for crystal growth to occur, a sample is prepared that contains the macromoleculein a solution and a precipitant that initiates evaporationand thus crystal formation. The new chip is capable ofmixing prescribed recipes from up to five solutioncomponents and of selectively delivering each of therecipe mixtures to separate growth wells that reside onthe same chip. Testing of this chip, which has beenongoing for several months in the IBC laboratories,has proven the efficacy of the approach. The IBC lab-on-a-chip system will provide a statistically significantsample, much higher throughput, and greater repeata-bility of macromolecular experiments. Automatedequipment that manages the chips allows scientists onthe ground to use the Internet to iteratively set up andvisually evaluate hundreds of crystallization experi-ments throughout the duration of an ISS flight incre-ment. The lab-on-a-chip technology developed by IBC, with its capacity to meter and mix biological flu-ids with picoliter accuracy, is well suited for commer-cial or academic structural biology research on Earthas well as in space. The unit will also be adaptable forother areas of research that employ microfluidics. In future space travel, miniaturized systems will be essential in reducing the mass and volume ofspacecraft systems. Microfluidics has the potential tofacilitate and automate scientific research across multi- ple disciplines. As NASA seeks to develop tools thatwill diminish the negative effects of long-term spacetravel on humans, lab-on-a-chip technology is apotential springboard for medical diagnostic and ther-apeutic devices that will ultimately make spaceflightsafer for humans. A New NASA Institute In November 2001, NASA awarded the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute(HWMI) in Buffalo, New York, a grant to establish theNASA Institute for Structural Biology (NISB).Hauptman-Woodward is an independent, nonprofit facili-ty specializing in basic research using structural biologyand is known worldwide for its expertise in crystalgrowth. The new NASA institute will be devoted to fos-tering research in the field of macromolecular biologyand in facilitating the use of low-gravity research oppor-tunities. Principal Investigator George DeTitta and hisco-investigator, HWMI Research Scientist Joseph Luft,and HWMI Executive Vice President and PrincipleResearch Scientist Walter Pangborn were named to headthe institute. NISB was formed in part to help structural biolo- gists access flight hardware through NASA's unifiedAssociate Investigator Program, which is focused on opening up spaceflight opportunities to a larger commu-nity of scientific researchers. Shortly after its inception,NISB began to promote awareness of the new program.The NISB contacted groups and individual members ofthe structural biology community, providing informationabout how the institute can assist investigators who wishto fly macromolecular crystallization samples in ISSexperiment hardware sponsored by NASA's PhysicalSciences Research Division. Also provided was a list ofupcoming flights available with instructions on how tomake an application. An independent peer-review panelwas set up to evaluate flight proposals, and the groupbegan reviewing applications for early 2003. Another important task for the NISB is to help selected researchers through the process of flying experi-ments on the ISS. To that end, the NISB will provide thesupport necessary to do adequate ground crystallizationexperiments and diffraction analyses to assess the effectsof microgravity, including making synchrotron radiationavailable. Timely access to synchrotron beam time fol-lowing retrieval of flight experiments is a high priorityfor researchers, as using electromagnetic radiation hasbecome an indispensable tool in the field of X-raycrystallography for molecular structure determination.NISB will help investigators secure access to theStanford Synchrotron Research Laboratory at StanfordUniversity. 3MACROMOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLOG In June 2002 New York State Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (second from left) announced the award of a $2.6 million grantover three years from NASA to the Hauptman-Woodward MedicalResearch Institute (HWMI) to establish the NASA Institute forStructural Biology at HWMI's Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.From left to right: George DeTitta, HWMI executive director andCEO; Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton; Ron Porter, manager,Science Planning and Program Management Group, MSFC;Herbert Hauptman, HWMI president; and Christopher Greene,HWMI chairman of credit: Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research InstituteANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 18ore than 70 years ago, cellular biologist E. B. Wilson wrote in his book The Cell in Development and Heredity that \"the key to every biological problem must finally be sought in thecell.\" All living creatures are made of cells \u2014 small,membrane-bound compartments filled with a con-centrated water-based solution of chemicals. Thesimplest forms of life are solitary cells that propagateby dividing in two. More complex organisms such ashumans are like cellular cities in which groups ofcells perform specialized functions and are linked byintricate communication systems. Cells occupy ahalfway point on the scale of biological complexity.Scientists study cells to try to understand theirmolecular makeup and to learn about how theycooperate to enable a complex organism to function. More than 200 types of cells make up the human body. They are assembled into a variety oftissues, such as skin, bone, and muscle. Most tissuescontain a mixture of cell types. Cells are small andcomplex \u2014 a typical animal cell is about five timessmaller than the smallest visible particle, and it con-tains all the molecules necessary to enable an organ-ism to survive and reproduce itself. A cell's smallsize makes it difficult for scientists to see its struc-ture, to discover its molecular composition, and especially to find out how its various components function. Differentiated cells perform specializedfunctions. For example, a heart muscle cell looksdifferent from and performs different functions thana nerve cell. Specialized cells interact and communi-cate with one another, setting up signals to governthe character of each cell according to its place in thestructure as a whole. What can be learned about cells depends on the available tools. Culturing (growing) cells is oneof the most basic techniques used by medicalresearchers. The growth of human cells outside thebody enables the investigation of the basic biologicaland physiological phenomena that govern the normallife cycle and many of the mechanisms of disease. Intraditional research methods, mammalian cells arecultured using vessels in which cells settle to the bot-tom surface of the vessel under the influence ofgravity. This gravitational influence results in a thinsheet of cells, with the depth of a single cell, called amonolayer. Cells in human tissues, however, arearranged in made it pos-sible for cells toaggregate, and in threedimensions in cultureson Earth. credit:: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002When cells are grown in a monolayer, they do not perform all the functions that the original tissue does. Although much valuable information can be gained from monolayer cell cultures, further under-standing of the processes that govern gene expres-sion and cellular differentiation is limited becausethe cells are not arranged as they are in the humanbody. When the influence of gravity is decreased, the cells are able to grow in more tissue-like, three-dimensional aggregates, or clusters. Until the cellularbiotechnology program developed a unique technol-ogy called the NASA Bioreactor, experiments toform three-dimensional cell formations were con-fined to the microgravity environment of space. The NASA-designed bioreactor allows cells to be cultured in a continuous freefall state, simulat-ing microgravity and providing a unique cell cultureenvironment on the ground. The growth medium-filled cylindrical vessel rotates about a horizontalaxis, suspending the cells in a low-shear* culturingenvironment. This allows for cell aggregation, differ-entiation, and growth. The bioreactor affordsresearchers exciting opportunities to create three-dimensional cell cultures that are similar to thetissues found in the human body. Using both space- and ground-based bioreac- tors, scientists are investigating the prospect ofdeveloping tissues that can be used in medical trans- plantation to replace failed organs and tissues.Additionally, investigators are striving to producemodels of human disease to be used in the develop-ment of novel drugs and vaccines for the treatmentand prevention of disease, to devise strategies toreengineer defective tissues, and to develop newhypotheses for the progression of diseases such ascancer. Finally, cells exposed to simulated and truemicrogravity respond by making adaptations thatgive new insights into cellular processes, establish acellular basis for the human response to microgravityand the space environment, and pave the way for cellbiology research in space regarding the transition ofterrestrial life to low-gravity environments. OVERVIEWBIOTECHNOLOG3CELLULAR BIOTECHNOLO The NASA rotating wall vessel bioreactor provides a low-turbulence culture environment that promotes the formation of large, three-dimensional cell clusters.

Therefore NASA Cell Science con-ferences, which had for many years been sponsored bythe Cellular Biotechnology Program (CBP) at JohnsonSpace Center in Houston, Texas, were jointly sponsoredby the CBP and the Fundamental Biology Program atAmes Research Center in Moffett Field, California, in2001 and in 2002. This successful collaboration betweenthe two centers will continue. The 2001 NASA Cell Science Conference and Annual Investigators Working Group Meeting was heldMarch 6-8, 2001, in Houston, Texas; this was the firstagencywide cell science conference. Approximately 190scientists from universities, NASA centers, the NationalInstitutes of Health, the National Space BiomedicalResearch Institute, and commercial cell culture enterpris-es attended the three-day conference. Sixty-three invitedspeakers gave talks in the following areas: cell move-ment/cytoskeleton, tissue modeling, biological responsesto physical forces, models in lower organisms, immunol-ogy, cell culture technology, proliferation and differentia-tion, and gene expression. Eight industry exhibitors alsoattended to showcase their products. The 2002 conference was held February 26-28, 2002, in Palo Alto, California, and was attended byapproximately 160 scientists and 10 exhibitors.Currently, planning is under way for the 2003 NASACell Science Conference, scheduled for February 20-22,2003. In addition to the research areas covered in pastconferences, the 2003 conference will be expanded toinclude presentations on neoplastic disease (cancer), sen-sors and analytical equipment, and gravity and mechani-cal sensing. The area of sensors and analytical equipmentencompasses work in advancing the state of the art inautomated cell culture technology. In space, the culturingof cells must be highly automated because it may be per-formed by crewmembers who are not proficient in thisvery time-consuming and skill-intensive procedure.Thus, sensing systems that can detect cell culture condi-tions and control them autonomously to ensure theyremain viable are necessary to ensure successful science.Gravity and mechanical sensing covers investigationsinto the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind themany varied responses seen in microgravity. Understandingthese is critical to understanding why we see many decreas-es in quality of physiological functions such as muscleatrophy and bone loss associated with spaceflight. Under the Cellular Biotechnology Program in fiscal years (FYs) 2001 and 2002, 47 principalinvestigators conducted scientific investigations in both ground- and flight-based environments, resulting in morethan 50 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journalsand proceedings. Additionally, a NASA ResearchAnnouncement for cellular biotechnology (NRA 01-OBPR-08-B) was issued in June 2002. Research solicited under this announcement sought to establish the scientific foundations for futureexperiments on the International Space Station (ISS) andto support the development of biotechnology applica-tions for long-duration spaceflight. The solicitation alsosought coordinated research efforts involving both space-and ground-based research that would lead to potentialflight experiments or development of new technologiesfor future NASA missions. NASA not only invitedresearch in the areas that it has previously supported,such as tissue engineering, bioreactor design, andchanges in gene expression, but also expanded the scopeto include other research areas that have been identifiedas having potential to contribute to human exploration ofspace. These new areas of supported research includeseparation, purification, and remediation methods;microbiosensor monitoring devices; and selective pres-sures on cell populations, among others. Separation, purification, and remediation meth- ods are needed to clean and recycle water on spacecraftduring future long-duration missions. Purification meth-ods must be specific for toxic molecules, reliable, andinexpensive and must make minimal demands on space-craft resources. The cellular biotechnology program cancontribute in this area by researching the use of cellu-lar organisms to convert or catalyze fluid waste tousable products such as drinking water, oxygen, ormethane. Likewise, the cellular biotechnology program can assist in the development of microbiosensor monitor-ing devices. The sensors will be microtechnology- andnanotechnology-based, will be extremely stable andsmall, and will be used for monitoring biological systemsand experiments to aid in the advancement of biotechno-logical processes and their use in support of long-duration space missions. Assessment of selective pressures on mammalian and microbial cell populations is critical to long-termoccupation of space. Changes in cells that are both geno-typic (changes in the makeup of the genes themselves)and phenotypic (changes in how the genes express them-selves externally) occurring over numerous generationsof cells exposed only to a space environment must bestudied in order to determine risks to our biologicalintegrity and to our life-based support systems wroughtby extended (and even permanent) stays in space. CELLULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY3ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002Proposals in response to the NRA were due September 6, 2002, and selections are expected to bemade in May 2003. For additional information, visithttp://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_u/nra/current/NRA-01-OBPR-08-B/index.html on the World Wide Web. Most of NASA's previous work in cell science has taken place on shuttle flights and on the Russianspace station, Mir. These experiments have demonstrated that microgravity and the space environment affect cellshape, signal transduction (the transfer of signals fromoutside the cell to inside the cell), replication and prolif-eration, gene expression, apoptosis (cell disintegration),and synthesis and orientation of intracellular and extra-cellular macromolecules. With the increased availabilityof research opportunities on the ISS and the new hard-ware developed specifically for this platform, more fre-quent and longer term investigations will undoubtedlyaccelerate the advancement of our understanding of howthe microgravity environment affects cell structure,processes, and functions. Flight Experiments FY 2001 and FY 2002 were again years of advances for the cellular biotechnology flight program.Several researchers flew experiments on space shuttleflights and on the ISS. Flight experiments included stud-ies of colon cancer metastasis, kidney cell gene expres-sion, and erythroleukemia. Additionally, in FY 2002 theCellular Biotechnology Programextended its efforts to expand biotech-nology commercial ventures by enlarg-ing its agreement with StelSys Inc. ofBaltimore, Maryland, to include flightexperiments aboard the ISS. Progresswas also made on the development ofthe Biotechnology Facility for the ISS. Principal Investigator (PI) J. Milburn Jessup's study of colon carci-noma metastasis using the NASAbioreactor flew to the ISS aboard STS-105 in August 2001. Jessup, of theGeorgetown University MedicalCenter, is a veteran of two spaceflightexperiments on shuttle missions STS-70 (July 1995) and STS-85 (August1997). STS-70 provided the proof thatNASA's rotating wall vessel bioreactor(RWV) could be used to grow three-dimensional cellular aggregates. Thecarcinoma cells provided by Jessup forthe experiment formed masses 10millimeters in diameter \u2014 30 timesthe volume of those grown in thecontrol experiment on the ground.The experiment was repeated on STS-85, again resulting in mature differentiated tissue samples and confirmingthat microgravity is an environment beneficial to cellculture and tissue growth. Experimental results from these two space shut- tle flights indicated that programmed cell death, or apop-tosis, occurred in the RWV on the ground but wasreduced in the actual microgravity cultures. The rate ofapoptosis in the MIP-101 (human colorectal carcinoma)cells approached that of the same cells growing as nonro-tated masses in three dimensions on a surface to whichthe cells did not attach. This finding was importantbecause it suggested that rotation at the speeds necessaryto suspend cells on Earth in the RWV may actually hurtthe cells. Other researchers have reported that RWVsoperated on Earth may also change the cytoskeleton, orbackbone, of cells in such a way that rotation may leadto cell death. In microgravity, the RWV does not need tospin as fast to keep the cells suspended, so the cells morenearly approach the nonrotated three-dimensional cul-tures on the ground. Jessup has recently found thatrotation on the ground also increases nitric oxide andreactive oxygen species production by as much as six to eight times. These substances can be quite toxic to cellsand cause the apoptosis seen in the RWV . Jessup's work from these flights resulted in two peer-reviewed publications in national journals regardingmetastatic characteristics of colon carcinoma. 3CELLULAR BIOTECHNOLO Timothy Hammond is examining how microgravity alters the gene expression in renal cells that ultimately enables kidneys to develop and function normally. He has found that the geneticexpression of human renal cells can be manipulated in microgravity to produce hormones thatare valuable in the treatment of disease.credit: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 22Preliminary ground research indicated that the metabo- lism of the MIP-101 line of colon cancer cells is signifi-cantly increased in microgravity; the cells essentiallyoutgrew the capacity of the rotating wall vessel bioreac-tor under simulated microgravity conditions. Additional flight experiments were conducted during the STS-108 mission in December 2001; analysisof those experimental samples is in progress. Jessup usedthe MIP-101 cells for the additional experiments becausethey differentiate, producing certain proteins, in theRWV . He conducted the experiment to assess howaggressively such cells will consume nutrients in micro-gravity when a three-dimensional culture is attempted, aswell as to test the metabolic requirements of space-basedbioreactors. Ultimately, Jessup hopes his research willaid in gaining additional needed information regardingthe mechanisms involved in colon cancer metastasis. Jessup is looking forward to testing the hypothe- sis that the apoptosis seen in the RWV on the ground andin some spaceflights is due to oxidative stress. In addi-tion to the results gathered from his studies of cell deathin MIP-101 cells, much evidence exists that reactiveoxygen and nitrogen species are generated both in cellsin culture and in muscles and organs in crewmembersand animals in space. This work may ultimately lead to abetter understanding of the effects of reduced gravity onsubcellular organelle distribution and oxidative stress. This may also help provide a means to assess new andbetter countermeasures for the deleterious aspects ofweightlessness. PI Timothy Hammond, of Tulane University Medical Center and the Veterans Affairs Medical Centerin New Orleans, Louisiana, has conducted a series ofspaceflight cell culture experiments using renal (kidney)cells. He is examining how microgravity alters the geneexpression in renal cells that ultimately enables kidneysto develop and function normally. During shuttle missionSTS-106 (September 2000), Hammond cultured three-dimensional constructs of normal human renal cells, andin early FY 2001, he analyzed the results regarding thegenetic expression of human cells in microgravity andtheir ability to be manipulated to produce renal hor-mones that are valuable in the treatment of disease. Continued studies of renal cells in microgravity aboard STS-105 in August 2001revealed additional information about themechanisms involved in these genetic manipu-lations and responses. Hammond was able toassess the cultured tissue's production of ery-thropoietin, a hormone produced mainly by thekidneys that stimulates the production of redblood cells by stem cells in bone marrow, andvitamin D 3, a substance converted by the kid- neys that plays an important role in the absorp-tion of calcium from the intestine, helping tomaintain strong bones. As expected, the pro-duction of both of these substances increaseddramatically in space. Hammond hopes toadapt the three-dimensional tissue model forcommercial production of these hormones. In FY 2002, Hammond flew renal cells on the ISS during Expedition 4 (December2001-June 2002). In this study, Hammondexamined the responses of normal human renalcells to a peptide sequence known to inhibitthe vitamin D receptor under microgravity. Inpatients with kidney disease characterized byheavy protein excretion, it is believed that theelevated levels of protein in the kidney cause tissue damage and scarring. This toxicity is thought to bedue to the binding of low-molecular weight proteins toscavenger receptors on the surface of the renal proximaltubules. Molecules that can disrupt the scavenger path-way by binding to the scavenger receptors include cer-tain classes of antibiotics as well as artificial blood andhormone precursors like vitamin D. Hammond evaluatedcellular structure and assessed the distribution of thevitamin D receptor and other biological molecules thatcontrol gene expression to understand the molecularCELLULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY3 Microgravity is valuable for peeling away the interfering effects of gravity and lay- ing bare functions of an organism that might not be apparent on Earth.

Long-term goals of Hammond's research include identi-fication of genes that respond to microgravity, modelingof renal injury mechanisms, and production of renal hor-mones of pharmacological importance. Changes in geneexpression in cells grown in space have demonstrated themetabolic pathways important in the response to micro-gravity, which is allowing the researchers to mimic thebiologically and pharmacologically useful elements ofthis response on the ground. PI Arthur Sytkowski, of Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, Massachusetts, conducted a flightexperiment during ISS Expedition 4 to study ery-throleukemia (EMS-3) cells. Erythroleukemia is a cancerof the blood-forming tissues in which large numbers ofimmature, abnormal red blood cells are found in theblood and bone marrow. The EMS-3 cells respond toerythropoietin, the natural inducer of the formation of redblood cells, and to other chemical inducers such asdimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Sytkowski and his teamcultured EMS-3 cells in orbit to test their responsivenesswhen exposed to these inducers in microgravity andcompare results to data from previous ground-basedrotating wall vessel bioreactor experiments. Because it has been known for some time that red blood cells do not evolve well in microgravity, thisresearch has a direct bearing on the future of long-termhuman spaceflight as well as on human diseases experi-enced on Earth. Data from these experiments willimprove our knowledge of the effects of microgravity onthe hematopoietic (blood-forming) system and will sug-gest possible in-flight and treatmentsfor negative effects of microgravity on astronauts andprovide insight into developing therapies for patients on Earth with diseases affecting blood cell formation. To carry on NASA's commitment to developing real-world applications of NASA's bioreactor technologyand to substantiate NASA's interest in the commercial-ization of microgravity research in areas related to bio-logical systems, NASA signed an agreement with StelSysInc. in 2002. This follows on the heels of the ground-breaking agreement NASA signed with StelSys inSeptember 2000, which began a new biotechnology com-mercial venture. The first agreement fostered theexploration of a new frontier in biotechnology, infec-tious disease research and the development of a liver-assist device for patients in need of transplant surgery. The agreement signed in 2002 augmented the initialventure by providing for the flight of experiments onthe ISS. The main objective of the StelSys series of experiments is to test the hypothesis that a microgravityenvironment will facilitate three-dimensional propagation of cultured liver cells into differentiated, functional tissueequivalents. As with other tissues grown in microgravity,obtaining three-dimensional constructs that function likethe liver in vivo would help researchers to better under- stand liver functions and develop drug therapies and testtheir efficacy before administering the drugs to patients.One of the specialized functions of the liver is to breakdown drugs or toxins into less harmful and more water-soluble substances that can be excreted from the body.ISS-based research will examine how human liver cellsprocess drugs in space, using the microgravity environ-ment to isolate individual cell functions. Onboard the ISS, the StelSys experiments will test the function of human liver cells in microgravity ver-sus the function of duplicate cells on Earth. Sponsors ofthis experiment hope that this work will elucidate theeffects of microgravity on the proper functioning of livercells and lead to earlier and more reliable screening ofnew drugs for patients in need of liver and kidney treat-ments prior to transplant. It could also acceleratedevelopment of new lifesaving drugs by pharmaceuti-cal companies because drug developers would be able totest their drug candidates in tissue constructs that main-tain their liver-specific functions for up to a week.Researchers could then choose only the best therapeuticcandidates for further testing, which may take place inhumans. Albert Li, of StelSys, grew liver cells in the Cellular Biotechnology Operations Support System,managed by Neal Pellis at Johnson Space Center. Cellswere transported on STS-111 in June 2002 to the ISS,where they were nurtured and grown. When cell growthwas complete, the samples were frozen and then trans-ported back to Earth for study by STS-112 in October2002. Li and his colleagues will assess the liver con-structs for true functionality to assess their usefulness fordrug screening and to determine their utility for produc-ing compounds that could improve human health. Great progress was made during FY 2002 on design and development of the ISS BiotechnologyFacility (BTF). The BTF is a complement of hardwareand science experiments designed to use the uniquemicrogravity environment of low Earth orbit as a tool inbasic and applied cell biology. Researchers will be ableto use BTF hardware that is based on an extensive her-itage of spaceflight-proven designs, including incubators,refrigerators, analytical instruments, and gas- and water-supply devices. This hardware will be contained insidetwo refrigerator-sized enclosures known as researchracks. For more about the BTF and milestones achievedin FYs 2001 and 2002, see the ISS chapter of this annualreport. 3CELLULAR BIOTECHNOLOANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 24The cellular biotechnology program has also made significant progress in the development ofadvanced sensors to support tissue culture. Growth oflong-duration mammalian cell and tissue cultures inspaceflight bioreactor systems requires automated moni-toring of culture parameters such as pH, glucose, andoxygen concentration. Four invention disclosures weremade to NASA during 2002 for a pH control process, aglucose control process, a glucose sensor, and an oxygensensor. The glucose sensor can continuously measureglucose present in cell culture medium in a perfusedbioreactor system, in which cells are grown in an excessof medium that continuously flows through the bioreac-tor. The oxygen sensor is an optical sensor based ondynamic fluorescent quenching of a pulsed blue lightthat is emitted by a light-emitting diode. The sensor isdesigned for long-term continuous measurement of dis-solved oxygen concentration in the cell culture mediumin perfused bioreactors. In 2002, two papers describingthe pH control process and the glucose sensor were pub-lished: \"Continuous pH Monitoring in a PerfusedBioreactor System Using an Optical pH Sensor,\" by A.S. Jeevarajan, V . Sundeep, T. D. Taylor, and M. M.Anderson (in Biotechnology and Bioengineering,78 (4), 467-72), and \"On-Line Measurement of Glucose in aRotating Wall Perfused Vessel Bioreactor Using anAmperometric Glucose Sensor,\" by X. Yuanhang, A. S.Jeevarajan, J. M. Fay, T. D. Taylor, and M. M. Anderson (inJournal of the Electrochemical Society, 149 (4), H103-106). Highlights Bringing Cancer Cells to Their Knees While much progress has been made in identify- ing the processes that give rise to cancer, new therapiesfor its treatment have not kept pace. Chemotherapy,which involves using drugs, including chemicals thatdamage DNA, remains the primary cancer treatmentoption for physicians. Unfortunately, cancer cells canexhibit resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. In somecases, this resistance develops during or very shortlyafter chemotherapy treatment, and often the resistancecan happen with several therapy agents, even when onlyone was administered. This is called acquired resistance.In other cases, tumor cells appear to be completely unre-sponsive to treatment with therapeutic agents, even ifthey are agents to which the cancer cells have never beenexposed. This is known as intrinsic resistance. In bothscenarios, the result is the same: the chemotherapy doesnot destroy the cancer cells. The mechanisms underlyingthis rapid onset of drug resistance in human cancer arenot clear. One problem in studying and combating thisresistance is the lack of cancer models that reproduceconditions occurring in vivo , or in the body. This is also a problem in studying the effects of various therapies oncancer cells.NASA investigator Jeanne Becker and her team of researchers at the University of South Florida, inTampa, have successfully used the NASA-developedHigh Aspect Ratio Rotating-Wall Vessel (HARV) to cul-ture three-dimensional constructs of human ovariantumor cells, which, as are breast tumor cells, are notori-ously difficult to grow outside the body. Becker beganworking with the rotating wall vessel bioreactor in 1992and continued with the HARV in her attempt to growthree-dimensional cancer cell aggregates that wouldfunction more like human tumors than the two-dimen-sional tissues obtained by traditional culture methods.The earlier rotating wall vessel bioreactor and the HARVboth provide a growing environment for cell cultures thatis similar to the one available in the microgravity condi-tions of low Earth orbit. The continuous rotation of thebioreactor keeps the growing cells in a state similar tothe freefall experienced by the space shuttle and the ISSas they orbit Earth, thereby mitigating the effects ofgravity that normally prevent the cells from growing inmore than a single layer. The constructs grown in therotating wall vessel bioreactor provide a model that ismore biologically representative of conditions that occurin vivo than models afforded by traditional culture sys- tems, and Becker plans to use them to study chemothera-peutic drug resistance. Becker also prepared a spaceflight experiment to compare ovarian tumor growth in a true microgravityenvironment to cells cultured in concurrent experimentson the ground and in the HARV . In August 2001, herexperiment was transported aboard STS-105 to the ISS,where it remained until December 2001. Human ovariantumor cells were cultured in microgravity for a 14-daygrowth period. The cells were preserved at three timepoints during culture so that they could be analyzed forCELLULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY3 In August 2001, PI Jeanne Becker sent human ovarian tumor cells to the ISS aboard STS-105. The tumor cells were cultured in microgravity for a14-day growth period and were analyzed for changes in the rate of cellgrowth and for synthesis of associated proteins, as well as evaluated forthe expression of several proteins that are the products of oncogenes,which cause the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells.

The experiment results will be used to define potential points of tumor cellular development that maybe targeted by chemotherapeutic drugs. Finding new tar-gets for chemotherapeutic drugs is especially importantin the case of ovarian cancer, which is usually not detect-ed until it is already in an advanced, incurable stage. Ultimately, Becker hopes that her research will provide oncologists with a better chance of predictingwhich drug treatments will work against ovarian cancer.With a three-dimensional model that behaves the waycancerous ovarian tissue in the body does, researcherswill have a more reliable means of predicting drug andhormone treatment efficacy before administering thosetreatments to patients. Becker's study of three-dimen-sional cell development offers great potential for improv-ing therapies for ovarian and other cancers. In another example of using the rotating wall vessel bioreactor to culture three-dimensional constructsof cancer cells, Peter Lelkes, of Drexel University, inPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, is attempting to grow vascu-larized tissue, which contains blood vessels, in vitro . Cancerous tumors are able to grow only because the for-mation of new blood vessels within the tumor providesthe oxygen and nutrients that are necessary to sustaingrowth. One of the strategies in combating such tumor-ous cancers, therefore, has been to look for ways to inter-fere with this blood vessel growth. If Lelkes can grow avascularized tissue in vitro , he will have created a tool with which to investigate the efficacy of drug therapiesthat can interfere with or prevent the blood vessel growththat sustains tumors as they grow in the body, therebyslowing or stopping tumor growth. Lelkes is currentlyattempting to co-culture microvascular endothelial cellswith prostate cancer cells in rotating wall bioreactors. Becker and Lelkes are just two researchers out of many who are using rotating wall vessel bioreactors andthe microgravity environment of low Earth orbit to try todevelop a better understanding of the mechanisms ofcancer development and better means of fighting cancerin humans. Neutralizing Virulent Micr obes Spacefarers can remain in a closed system for weeks, sometimes months \u2014 and for proposed long-duration flights, maybe even years \u2014 breathing recycledair and drinking recycled water. Given that some virulentmicrobes appear to thrive in microgravity, that's not apromising scenario for health, according to Cheryl Nickerson, assistant professor of microbiology andimmunology at Tulane University Health SciencesCenter's program in molecular pathogenesis and immunity. Nickerson says that spacegoers alreadyappear to have a higher risk of falling ill. In ground-based studies simulating microgravity, Nickerson and her research team have found that a com-mon strain of bacteria known as Salmonella typhimurium can alter its genetic profile, upping the production of cer-tain self-protecting proteins that may enhance virulence.That could be unwelcome news for future astronauts.Microgravity may also reduce antibiotic effectiveness,and absent any new pharmacological approach, the dif-ficult task of in-space treatment is made even morechallenging. In the course of their investigation, Nickerson and her colleagues found that more than 100 Salmonella genes, or about 3 percent of the salmonella genome,altered genetic expression. The changes made the bacte-ria far more lethal: mice injected with the strains grownin modeled microgravity died, on average, three daysearlier than expected from shock and from large-organfailure. Nickerson's original studies in simulated micro- gravity involved the use of the rotating wall vessel biore-actor, which mimics reduced gravity. Cells of S. typhimurium were placed in a culture within the bioreac- tor chamber. When the bioreactor spun, it maintained thecells in close approximation of freefall, which astronautsexperience as up to one-millionth of Earth's normal gravity.3CELLULAR BIOTECHNOLO the pathogen, Salmonella typhimurium , whose genetic response to gravity's near absence could provide clues to infection protection. Here, Nickerson (faright) works with her laboratory staff: also cultured S. typhimurium under nor- mal-gravity conditions. In addition, to study how S. typhimurium causes infection in people, Nickerson and her colleagues usedthe bioreactor to culture three-dimensional human intes-tinal epithelial cells, which more accurately model thephysiology of human intestinal tissue than does conven-tional tissue culture. In response to the microbial inva-sion, the cells produced higher levels of substancescalled anti-inflammatory cytokines, which may help limitdamage to the intestinal tissue following salmonellainfection. The three-dimensional intestinal cells alsoshowed less damage and cell death following salmonellainfection when compared with other types of cellsknown as monolayers. These observations are consistentwith the self-limiting nature of salmonella infection,according to Nickerson, which can damage or kill epithe-lial cells in otherwise healthy individuals before beingdestroyed by immune reaction. According to the Centers for Disease Control, salmonella-related maladies are among the most com-mon intestinal infections in the United States, with40,000 cases reported yearly. However, scientists esti-mate that because only 3 to 5 percent of salmonella casesare actually reported nationwide, and many milder casesare never diagnosed, the true incidence is much higher,likely in the millions. As many as 1,000 Americans dieannually from salmonella infections. Bacteria are not premeditated killers. Their goals, like all organisms, are to survive, thrive, andreproduce. To do so, they release certain proteins. In nat-ural environments, these proteins neutralize substancesharmful to the bacteria. When ingested into a humandigestive tract, the same mechanisms are engaged.Although the strong acids found in the stomach kill up to99 percent of the would-be bacterial colonizers, the 1percent that do survive are able to \"express,\" or release,the protective proteins that cause so much upset to theirhuman hosts. The immunologic battle between host andpathogen can be fierce. Most of the time, the immunesystem wins, containing the infection, but sometimesthe bacteria can overcome all defenses, and death canresult. Although most S. typhimurium -caused infections in the United States don't require hospitalization or seri-ous medical intervention, at least in healthy people, theyare potentially fatal if untreated in people with weakenedimmune systems. Deciphering the bacteria's molecularresponses could lead \u2014 with new drugs and vaccines \u2014to a means to treat or even neutralize salmonella infec-tions, quickly lessening or eliminating the characteristicnausea, vomiting, intestinal inflammation, and diarrheathat they cause.As humans work for longer periods in space, they may bring with them preexisting infections.Moreover, despite precautions, foods brought on boardcould conceivably harbor salmonella bacteria. Dependingon severity, a salmonella-induced illness could pose seri-ous dangers. And those dangers could be even worse ona space mission, where astronaut immune systems mayalready be stressed. Nickerson explains, \"Something likefood poisoning could put a mission at risk, or in theworst case, threaten crew survival.\" Nickerson plans to send S. typhimurium into orbit to see if the results she obtains there are similar tothose she obtained on the ground. Her hope is to build adetailed roadmap of how salmonella bacteria sense andrespond to microgravity. Once that roadmap is complete,she hopes it will be a guide for developing effectiveremediation strategies. How the Body Fights Back One concern with space travel is the fact that exposure to the microgravity environment apparentlycauses impairment of the immune system. NASA's high-est priority is to ensure the health and safety of astro-nauts in space, and consequently, NASA supports manyresearch investigations related to the immune system.NASA investigator Joshua Zimmerberg, with a team ofresearchers at the NASA/National Institutes of HealthCenter for Three-Dimensional Tissue Culture, Bethesda,Maryland, is contributing to unraveling the mystery ofhow the immune system changes in microgravity. Theteam is looking specifically at the effects on lymph tissueand lymphocytes. The immune system is complex and composed of many elements, all of which work in concert to pro-tect the body from foreign invaders like bacteria andviruses. Among the components of the immune systemare the lymph system, a passive system of lymph fluid,or blood plasma, which provides nutrients obtained fromthe blood to cells and carries waste away; the thymus;the spleen; bone marrow; white blood cells; antibodies,also known as immunoglobulins; and hormones. Eachcomponent has a specific role in the body's immuneresponse. The best-known defenders within the body are the white blood cells, which differ from other cells in thebody in that they behave more like independent, single-celled organisms that are incapable of reproducing.Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. Some lym-phocytes, known as B cells, produce specific antibodiesfor specific germs. When a B cell recognizes a markeron a germ called an antigen, it will clone itself and pro-duce millions of antibodies against that germ. In con-trast, T cells, the other type of lymphocyte, must actuallyCELLULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY3ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002come into contact with cells that contain viruses or bac- teria in order to be able to kill them. Both B cells and Tcells can be found in the bloodstream, but they tend toconcentrate in the lymph tissue. Zimmerberg and his team conducted experiments that involved growing human lymphoid tissue cells in theNASA-developed rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWV),which simulates some aspects of microgravity by gentlyrotating growing cells to maintain them in an environ-ment similar to freefall. The sample cells were isolatedfrom the tonsils of five human donors for use during thisexperiment. Tonsils are granular tissue similar to lymphnodes that are found at the back of the throat. They workas part of the immune system by sampling and filteringgerms that enter the body through the mouth. The resultsdemonstrated that some immune functions becameimpaired with exposure to the simulated microgravityconditions provided by the RWV . When the tissues cultured in the RWV were chal- lenged with recall antigens, markers to which the lym-phoid tissues had previously been exposed, they did notrespond by producing specific antibodies, as they shouldhave. The previous exposure should have caused thelymphoid tissue to recognize those markers and mountan immune response. The tissues grown in the RWVwere also challenged with polyclonal antigens, whichwere descended from more than one group of cells, to tryto obtain a general immune response, but unlike culturesgrown by traditional, nonrotating methods, the tissuesdid not respond with increased immunoglobulin produc-tion. These results indicate that lymphocytes lose theirability to be activated when cultured in the RWV .However, when the lymphocytes were activated by expo-sure to antigens prior to being cultured in the RWV , theyremained activated during the culture. This shows that the timing of the activation period is critical tothe cells' immunogenic capability. Subsequent studies were conducted on the ISS in order to determine if results obtained from theRWV cultures could be replicated in a true micro-gravity environment. The RWV creates an envi-ronment that mimics some, though not all, aspectsof microgravity, and cells cultured in ground stud-ies do not experience other factors associated withspaceflight that may affect immune function.Zimmerberg's flight experiment flew to the ISS onshuttle mission STS-108 in December 2001. TheISS samples were returned to investigators foranalysis in April 2002. On the ISS, the tonsil cell cultures were grown in Teflon bags and challenged with antigens.Preliminary results indicate that differences existbetween the flight and ground samples and demon- strate an impaired immune response in the microgravitysamples. Further analysis will determine whether thesedifferences are similar to those seen between RWV andground samples. Future experiments will examine pat-terns of membrane reorganization and changes in thecytoskeletons of cells cultured in the RWV; thesechanges could impair the cells' ability to recognize andrespond to viruses and bacteria. Preliminary results suggest that responses in true microgravity are similar to those seen in simulatedmicrogravity. A second experiment to continue gatheringinformation regarding T cell and B cell interactions lead-ing to lymphocyte activation has been scheduled. If theresults are indeed similar in both simulated and truemicrogravity, then it could be much easier to begin iden-tifying the cause of immune impairments, becauseresearchers could rely on the RWV for their experimentsinstead of having to wait for infrequent spaceflightopportunities. Conducting experiments in the RWVwould also allow researchers to replicate their experi-ments, which is currently difficult due to limitations onpayload capacity and time for conducting researchaboard the ISS. The study of these immune impairmentscould have important impact on the future of space traveland on human health on Earth. The human immuneresponse in space is blunted, and thus the potential forpathological diseases associated with reduced immuno-logical capability on long-duration spaceflights, such as amission to Mars, becomes a significant risk. Understandingwhy the immune response is adversely affected is a neces-sary first step in developing countermeasures that can miti-gate this risk. On Earth, understanding the mechanisms ofimpaired immune response has potential applications in thestudy and treatment of autoimmune diseases and immuno-deficiencies, such as AIDS. 3CELLULAR BIOTECHNOLOG PI Joshua Zimmerberg is studying how microgravity affects the human immune system. In ground-based studies, Zimmerberg exposed human tonsil tissue toantigen markers and then grew that tissue under simulated microgravity in arotating wall vessel. He then re-exposed the tissue to antigen markers to see ifthe cells would respond by producing antibodies. credit: National Institutes of Healthombustion and the results of combustion processes affect each of us every day. The majorityof the world's electric power production, homeheating, and ground and air transportation are madepossible by combustion. Despite these benefits,combustion by-products are major contributors toair pollution and global warming. Additionally,unintentional fires claim thousands of lives and costbillions of dollars in property damage each year.Improved control of combustion would be of great benefit to socie-ty, yet it isimpeded by alack of funda-mental under-standing ofcombustionprocesses. The effects of gravitational forces on Earth hamper combustion research. Gravity causes hot,lightweight gases produced during combustion torise. The movement of the gases generates airflowsthat produce flames that are often unsteady and non-symmetrical, such as flames produced by a camp-fire. This gravity-induced flow makes the flamesvery difficult to model mathematically. Combustiontheories, therefore, are often based on nonbuoyantsteady, symmetrical flames, and are difficult to test on real-world combustion processes. Research inmicrogravity offers unprecedented opportunities forcritical measurement of large, steady, slow-moving,symmetric flames, since the forces of gravity andthe resulting airflow movements are effectivelyeliminated. The data from experiments conducted in microgravity are used to verify combustion theories,validate numerical models, and develop freshinsights into fundamental combustion phenomena,all of which can be applied to Earth-based combus-tion processes. Research in microgravity hasrevealed information about thermal and chemicalprocesses that play a role in flame propagation andextinction, for example. These processes, whilepresent on Earth, are difficult to observe becausethey are often hidden by more dominant reactionsattributable to gravity. CCOVERVIEWCOMBUSTION SCIENCE4 Combustion processes provide us with power,enable transportation,and sometimes the environmentthrough fires and pollu-tion. increasinglydeveloped and industrial-ized, the need for bettercontrol and understand-ing of combustion hasbecome clear. ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 28 ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002Program Summary In fiscal years (FYs) 2001 and 2002, the research program in micrograv-ity combustion science maintained itsprimary focus of working toward anunderstanding of fundamental combus-tion processes and flame structures. Atthe same time, the program strengthenedits applications-based focus to aid NASAin developing solutions for crew healthand safety issues. During FY 2001, themicrogravity combustion science pro-gram funded new and ongoing researchprojects for 75 principal investigators(PIs) working on 23 flight investigationsand 58 ground-based projects. During FY2002, there were 72 PIs working on 22flight investigations and 58 ground-basedprojects. A list of all ongoing combustionscience research projects, along with thenames of the investigators conducting theresearch, is provided in Appendix A. In FY 2001, research projects selected under the 1999 NASA ResearchAnnouncement (NRA) in combustionscience were awarded funding andresearch began. In total, 20 investiga-tions, all of them ground-based studies,were initiated. Six more research propos-als submitted in response to the 1999NRA were awarded funding in January2001 from the Spacecraft Fire Safety(SFS) program. All of the SFS-selectedproposals address critical needs in thearea of spacecraft fire safety; two of thesix were selected for flight-definitionwork. This suite of research, integratedwithin Bioastronautics initiative,focused on generating specific, attain-able, applications-based solutions toNASA's fire safety issues for crewmembers living and working aboardspacecraft. A workshop to further focus the SFS program was conducted in June2001. Objectives included the identifica-tion of research needed to assess andimprove fire protection strategies for thespace shuttle, the International SpaceStation (ISS), and their payloads; theidentification of fire safety concerns forprolonged crewed missions in Earth'sorbit and beyond; and finally, the antici-pation of research needs for future lunar4COMBUSTION SCIEN Researchers working on fire safe- ty issues in space need to beable to predict the behavior offires in order to better design pro-tective measures for astronautsand equipment.ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 30COMBUSTION SCIENCE4 and Martian habitats. By the end of the workshop, the spacecraft fire safety research roadmap had been updated,dialogue was opened between microgravity combustionresearchers and ISS designers and operations personnel,and many research needs were identified. (See http:// www.ncmr.org/events/firesafety on the World Wide Web [WWW] for more information.) The SFS program also published the first annual report of its research results in February 2002, titledBioastronautics Initiative Spacecraft Fire SafetyResearch FY01 Annual Report and Research Plan . Included in the report were interim results from experi-ments started in FY 2001 on material flammability, fireand smoke detection, and fire suppression. For copies ofthe report, write to Gary Ruff, NASA Glenn ResearchCenter, ground-based microgravity tion science program continues on its path to contributesignificantly to the body of knowledge in the combustionscience community at large. Activities during FYs 2001and 2002 have yielded significant findings both in funda-mental scientific studies of phenomena and in areas havingterrestrial and space-based applications. The combustion program has also addressed NASA's need to solve prob-lems in spacecraft and nonterrestrial habitat fire safetythat are key to pursuing long-term space explorationgoals. These safety issues are linked to exploringregimes in material flammability phenomena, fire detec-tion, and suppression. The results obtained are cruciallyimportant to the scientifically challenging missions thatNASA plans to pursue. Current areas of ground-basedstudies include the development of an apparatus to assessmaterial flammability in microgravity and research tounderstand the chemical and physical aspects of fire sup-pression in nonterrestrial environments. By the end ofFY 2002, a majority of the 40 ground-based investiga-tions initiated through the 1997 NRA in microgravitycombustion science were completed. The 81 investiga-tions supported in FY 2001 (from the 1997 and 1999NRA grant pools) generated 34 journal articles and 16papers published in conference proceedings. More than20 presentations based on this research were delivered atnational and international forums, and investigators madecontributions to 4 books as a result of their work. In FY2002, 80 funded investigations generated 37 journal arti-cles, 20 papers published in conference proceedings, 30presentations, and contributions to 9 books. FY 2002 saw a new practice initiated within the Physical Sciences Research (PSR) Division. Instead ofreleasing biennial NRAs for each individual discipline,PSR will release every year a suite of NRAs covering allthe disciplines. Within a suite, individual NRAs for eachdiscipline will be on a staggered schedule. FY 2002'sNRA suite was announced on December 21, 2001.Ninety combustion science proposals were received by March 22, 2002, and 22 proposals were selected forfunding in September 2002. The awards will be fundedin FY 2004. Topics solicited by the combustion scienceNRA included gaseous flames; droplets, sprays, particles,and dust clouds; surface combustion and fire safety;chemical vapor deposition and vapor infiltration process-ing; supercritical water oxidation; and thermal plasmas. Acomplete list of funded projects may be found on theWWW at http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_u/code_ u.cfm . Flight Experiments Experiments in space further refine and validate combustion theories and extend the understanding ofcombustion phenomena that are obscured by gravity. Thelonger periods \u2014 weeks or months \u2014 in microgravityand the generally higher-quality microgravity conditionsthat can be obtained in orbit on the space shuttles and theISS are invaluable to combustion researchers, since some Paul Ronney is studying Radiative Enhancement Effects on Flame Spread to betterunderstand how flames spread over thick mate-rials in low gravity. These data will enable scien-tists to improve spacecraft fire safety, as bothflames and extinguishing agents function differ-ently in low gravity than they do in normal gravi-ty. Shown are the differences in flame spreadover thick solid fuel in an oxygen-carbon dioxideatmosphere in microgravity and in Earth'sgravity REPORT 2001-20024COMBUSTION SCIEN phenomena, such as slow-burning smoldering reactions, are difficult to observe over the seconds-long episodes ofmicrogravity conditions obtainable in ground-basedfacilities. In FYs 2001 and 2002, investigators continued preparations for 20 flight research projects that requirethe microgravity conditions available in orbit. Two inves-tigations, the Spread Across Liquid (SAL) experimentand the Microgravity Smoldering Combustion ReflightExperiment (MSCRE), completed their final flights, oneon a sounding rocket, and the other on a space shuttleflight. They are now in the data analysis phase, and finalreports of results will be published within a year. Twomore investigations have near-term flight opportunitiesaboard the space shuttle. The remaining 18 investigationscontinued along the research formulation and hardwareimplementation paths toward flight opportunities aboardthe ISS. The SAL experiment made its sixth and final flight aboard a Black-Brandt sounding rocket at theWhite Sands Test Range in 2001. The investigation pro-vided unique data to PI Howard Ross, of Glenn ResearchCenter, about the phenomenon of flame spread acrossliquid pools under varying conditions. The near absenceof gravity during this experiment allowed detailed char-acterization of the liquid and gaseous flow phenomenathat control the flame spread, and the factors that controlthe flame spread instability were determined and used tovalidate a numerical flame spread model. MSCRE, led by PI Carlos Fernandez-Pello, of the University of California, Berkeley, completed itsflight data collection aboard two space shuttle missions,STS-105 (launched August 10) and STS-108 (launchedDecember 5), in 2001. Each flight provided an opportu-nity to conduct two independent smoldering combustiontests. MSCRE is a study of smoldering combustion inporous materials. Smoldering is a flameless form of com-bustion that can often lead to house fires. By conductingthe experiment in microgravity, researchers were able toidentify the limiting conditions for smoldering combus-tion to spread and ignite. These results suggest that smol-dering fires can exist under microgravity conditions andare therefore a credible fire risk aboard spacecraft. Throughout FYs 2001 and 2002, plans and mis- sion hardware preparations for several flight missionswere under way. The original Combustion Module sys-tem (CM-1), which flew aboard the first MicrogravityScience Laboratory (MSL-1) mission on STS-83(launched April 4, 1997) and STS-94 (launched July 1,1997), has been refurbished as CM-2 and was integratedwith the SPACEHAB carrier for a flight aboard STS-107in the winter of 2003. The CM-2 system will supportthree investigations: Laminar Soot Processes (LSP),Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-Number (SOF-BALL), and Water Mist (MIST). PIs Gerald Faeth, of theUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Paul Ronney, ofthe University of Southern California, Los Angeles, willconclude their data collection for LSP and SOFBALL,respectively, with this flight. LSP studies the mechanisms Soot and nitrous oxides are primary combustion by-products that contribute significantly to air pollution, a growing environ- mental concern. Richard Axelbaum is studying flames in microgravity to better understand their mechanisms. He has foundthat removing the nitrogen from the oxidizer (air) and adding it to the fuel produces less soot and nitrous oxides than theusual flames with fuel reacting with air. This effect is shown in image (a) which shows a fuel air flame (white and pink indi-cate soot) and image (b) which shows a flame of nitrogen and fuel reacting with oxygen. The flames are otherwise identicalwith the soot being dramatically reduced by the movement of the nitrogen from the air to the fuel. credit: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 32COMBUSTION SCIENCE4 of soot production to determine ways of controlling it, as soot is a major contributor to pollution and an importantfactor in fire suppression. SOFBALL explores \"flameballs\": tiny, stable, spherically symmetric flames thatoccur only in microgravity. These flame balls may holdanswers to some fundamental questions about fires. PIThomas McKinnon, of the Colorado School of Mines,Golden, will be conducting MIST for the first time onSTS-107. MIST reexamines the old practice of usingwater to fight fires, updating the technique by using afine mist delivery system. Microgravity conditions willhelp researchers to determine optimal water concentra-tion and droplet size for this new method of fire suppres-sion. MIST is also proposed for flight aboard the ISS,where it will be accommodated in the CombustionIntegrated Rack (CIR). The transition from conducting combustion experiments aboard sounding rockets and the space shut-tle toward full utilization of the research capability of theISS continued in FYs 2001 and 2002. Two research facil-ities, the CIR and the Microgravity Science Glovebox(MSG), are still being prepared for upcoming flights.More details about these facilities can be found in theInternational Space Station section of this report. In conjunction with the development of the CIR portion of the Fluids and Combustion Facility, the com-bustion science program is working to prepare a numberof experiments and associated hardware for upcomingresearch flights to the space station. Detailed engineeringof a Multi-User Droplet Combustion Apparatus (MDCA)and an apparatus known as FEANICS (Flow EnclosureAccommodating Novel Investigations in Combustion ofSolids) is under way. Each apparatus will enable multipleexperiments to be conducted within the CIR. The MDCA, which enables droplet combustion research, will be the first research payload in the CIR.Research on the combustion of fuel droplets is importantbecause there are many kinds of practical devices thatdeliver fuel to combustors in droplet form, includingdiesel engines and industrial turbine engines, and opti-mizing combustion in these devices could improve fuelefficiency and reduce pollution, among other things.Studies in microgravity allow researchers to investigatespherical fuel droplets, which are much easier to modelmathematically than gravitationally influenced, tear-shaped droplets. Four investigations have been identifiedfor an initial set of research projects utilizing the com-bined capabilities of the CIR and MDCA systems: theDroplet Combustion and the DynamicDroplet Combustion Experiment. The MDCA will alsoremain available for use with new droplet investigationsthat may be proposed in the future. Multiuser hardwaresuch as the MDCA allows more effective resource uti- lization of the ISS and the CIR. Subsequent to the completion of MDCA and its investigations, the research pace for the CIR will pickup, and six investigations in solid fuels research will beconducted in the FEANICS apparatus. This research hasdirect, tangible application to the Spacecraft Fire Safetyinitiative in that it contributes to understanding fire igni-tion, the persistence of combustion flames in real materi-als, and fire extinction in microgravity. The first group ofFEANICS investigations are Forced Ignition and SpreadTest; Radiative Enhancement Effects on Flame Spread(REEFS); Smolder, Transition, and Flaming inMicrogravity; Analysis of Thermal and HydrodynamicInstabilities in Near-Limit Atmosphere; Transition FromIgnition to Flame Growth Under External Radiation inThree Dimensions; and Solid Inflammability Boundaryat Low Speed. Results from these experiments willdefine characteristic events such as ignition susceptibili-ty, transition from smolder to full flames, radiativeeffects of flames to self-feed an existing fire, three-dimensional combustion effects of ignition, and propaga-tion of flames in a spacecraft environment. Following the completion of the FEANICS investigations, the combustion program will expand itsresearch portfolio into gaseous combustions, addressingflame design, clean flames, and spherical flames.Presently, 14 combustion investigations have been select-ed to be conducted within the CIR by 2011, with the pos-sibility of four or more additional experiments sponsoredand developed by commercial and international partners. Three flight investigations, REEFS, Flame Design, and Clean Flames, passed their science conceptreviews during FY 2002, thus completing the flight-defi-nition phase and coming one step closer to being con-ducted aboard the ISS. Led by PI Paul Ronney, REEFSstudies flame spread over flat, solid fuel beds as a meansof understanding more complex flames, such as thosefound in fires inside enclosures like spacecraft or build-ings. This experiment is a continuation of previousinvestigations geared toward studying the atmospheresand flow environments likely to be present in fires thatmight occur in microgravity. Flame Design, led by PI Richard Axelbaum, of Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, studies sim-ple flames in microgravity to learn how to reduce sootand nitrous oxides, the main products of combustion thatalso contribute to air pollution. A normal combustionreaction consists of fuel mixed with air (nitrogen andoxygen). Researchers have found that soot and nitrousoxides can be reduced if the air is first separated intonitrogen and oxygen, then nitrogen is mixed with fuel,and oxygen is added separately. Reducing the productionANNUAL REPORT 2001-20024COMBUSTION SCIEN of soot and nitrous oxides during combustion will be cheaper for industry than scrubbing out these pollutantsafterwards. Combustion in microgravity produces one-dimensional, strain free flames, allowing direct study offlames using mixtures of air and fuel or fuel and nitrogenwith oxygen added separately. These studies wouldn't bepossible in normal gravity due to the loss of symmetryand to buoyancy-induced strain in the flames. The resultswill provide valuable fundamental insight into the mech-anisms of combustion. Clean Flames, led by PI Robert Cheng, of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley,California, aims to contribute to clean energy technologyby studying lean premixed combustion, the least pollut-ing way to burn gaseous hydrocarbon fuels like naturalgas. The experiment seeks to take advantage of nonbuoy- ant flames produced in microgravity to study the interac-tion of flame turbulence with the combustor chamber.The results obtained will enable the design of more com-pact burners for small-scale heating needs (e.g., waterheaters and furnaces). Four combustion science investigations are slat- ed to be conducted within the MSG on the ISS by 2006.Fiber-Supported Droplet Combustion will investigatefundamental combustion science issues in liquid fuelscombustion, and Candle Flames will address solid andliquid fuel transitions. The other two experiments areapplications-based. The Smoke Point in CoflowExperiment studies soot generation in gaseous flames;Smoke investigates spacecraft smoke detector perform-ance in low-gravity conditions. The Smoke experimentdirectly supports knowledge regarding smoke detectorperformance on the ISS and space shuttles. Its resultswill provide insight into performance differencesbetween Earth-based and on-orbit fire detection. Smokeis funded within the new SFS initiative. Highlights Combustion Under Pressur e: ANew Understanding Revealed Automobiles, jet aircraft, and even rockets all have one thing in common: they are powered by internalcombustion engines operated under high pressures, in therange of 5-100 atmospheres (atm). (By comparison, nor-mal atmospheric pressure at sea level is only 1 atm.)Combustion under high pressures is thermodynamicallymore efficient, as well as more fuel efficient, leading toreduced emissions of pollutants and less production ofcarbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming.However, combustion processes typically found withininternal combustion engines are usually studied at 1 atm,where flames are relatively easy to control and observe.When pressure increases, as Principal Investigator ChungLaw, of Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey,explains, so does the difficulty in conducting well-con-trolled and useful experiments. According to Law, extrapolations from experi- ments at 1 atm are highly unlikely to yield quality datafor higher-pressure systems. The basis for extrapolationis just too limited for any reliable prediction of whatcould be happening with a flame at 50 or even 100 timesthe normal pressure. There is no substitute for conduct-ing experiments under high-pressure conditions. But it isnot easy to observe such experiments. High-pressureexperiments have been frequently done in what are called\"bombs\"\u2014 totally enclosed, windowless systems. Withinthese systems, researchers can measure the pressure Combustion theory got an update when flames in a high-pressure combustion reactionrevealed their \"wrinkles.\" At 1 atm, the flamesurface remained smooth as it propagated outward, but at even slightly increased pres-sures (5 atm), the flame developed a bumpy appearance. Modeling of flames in internalcombustion engines will benefit from thisnew revelation.credit: NASA1 atm 2.0 ms 2.5 ms 3.0 ms 3.5 ms 4.0 ms5 atm 1.5 ms 2.0 ms 2.5 ms 3.0 ms 3.5 msTimeANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 34COMBUSTION SCIENCE4 increase caused by combustion. From that, they can speculate about what happened inside the bomb basedon some assumed combustion processes. While someuseful data are obtained from these experiments, the lackof visual observation severely limits the value of theresults. To overcome this limitation, scientists would have to be able to observe the experiments in progress.But combustion chambers that allow the flame to bevisually observable without distortion through specialoptical windows cannot tolerate the buildup of pressureand temperature caused by the combustion products.Challenged by the need to visually study the effects ofpressure on flame propagation, Law and his researchassociates, Stephen Tse and Delin Zhu, devised an appa-ratus that would allow them to obtain images of theflame as it propagates, while maintaining the chamberpressure constant at its initial value, which can be ashigh as 60 atm. The apparatus comprises two chambers, one inside the other, with aligned optical windows. A sleeveconnecting the two chambers can be opened and closed.After evacuating both chambers, the sleeve is closed, andresearchers pump the combustible gas under study intothe inside chamber and an inert gas into the outer cham-ber. After the pressures inside the two chambers areequalized, the sleeve is opened. The inert gas and thecombustible gas come into contact, but with very littlemixing. A centrally located spark then immediatelyignites the combustible gas. The resulting sphericalflame propagates outward until it meets the boundary ofthe inert gas, where it is extinguished. Since the volumeof the inner chamber is much smaller than that of theouter chamber, there is negligible pressure buildup with-in both chambers during combustion. The entire process,from flame ignition to propagation and extinction, can berecorded on high-speed video. While observing the resulting images, Law was surprised to see that the flame surface looked differentthan expected at high pressures. At 1 atm, the flame sur-face remains smooth. However, at even a moderatelyhigh pressure of 5 atm, wrinkles develop over the flamesurface. What surprised Law about his experimentalobservations was the strong propensity and prevalence ofwrinkled flames at higher pressures. In hindsight, Lawexplains, this is reasonable, because chemical reactionsprogress faster at higher pressures, yielding faster-burn-ing flames that are more unstable. The recognition that flames wrinkle at high pressures fundamentally alters the understanding of theburning processes within internal combustion engines.The rate of fuel consumption increases with the flame'sincreasing area. Since wrinkles dramatically increase theflame's surface area, the flame actually burns much faster than previously realized. Without seeing the flame,an investigator could easily be misled about the meaningof the fast rate of fuel consumption. Law has conducted a large portion of his research at Earth's gravity, where buoyancy can have asignificant influence on the propagation of weak flames,such as those associated with fuel-lean burning.Moreover, the effects of gravity are aggravated underhigh pressures; gas is even more buoyant because densi-ty is proportional to pressure: the higher the pressure, thegreater the density differences between the hot gases andthe cooler gases surrounding the flame. In NASA's 2.2-Second Drop Tower at Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, Law is able to con-duct his experiments on high-pressure burning withoutthe disturbing influence of gravity. However, experi-ments with really slow-burning, weakly combustiblemixtures, which are of relevance to the study of flameextinction phenomena, require much longer microgravitytimes in order to observe the burning process in itsentirety. Eventually, these experiments may need to beconducted on the International Space Station, which pro-vides longer-term access to microgravity conditions. Fir e Safety Gets New Emphasis Fr om Space Resear ch As crews from the United States and its partners assemble the ISS, the casual observer might miss anunderlying emphasis on safety that sometimes makes thework appear effortless. Safety has always been NASA'sprimary concern. Space travel, as with all forms ofexploration, is vulnerable to a variety of hazards.NASA's determination to maintain a safe environmenttakes precedence over anything else. Supporting research for in-orbit fire prevention is one way NASA meets its commitments to reducinghazards for ground and flight crews. Fire is a violentchemical reaction, combining oxygen with other materi-als to produce smoke, heat, and deadly chemicals. Firesafety research is furthering the understanding of thebasic science behind combustion processes, enabling sci-entists to better understand and define the fire problemsfaced by the space program. Scientists are using thisknowledge to develop advanced, fire-safe materials and to tackle new designs to mitigate or eliminatethese problems. The first step in fire safety is to select materials that don't burn easily in low gravity. The MaterialsCombustion Research Facility at Marshall Space FlightCenter in Huntsville, Alabama, tests materials against arange of industry and NASA standards. But because it isANNUAL REPORT 2001-20024COMBUSTION SCIEN impossible to eliminate all combustible materials from inside a spacecraft, steps also must be taken to ensurethat a fire can be detected and extinguished while pro-tecting the crew and equipment. ISS fire detectors lookfor smoke particles sparkling in a laser beam. To fightfires, the crew is supplied with portable fire extinguishersthat dispense carbon dioxide and portable breathingapparatus. To add to these prophylactic measures, NASAis looking for a nontoxic suppressant that does not foulthe life support system or require extensive cleanup.Research is also needed in computational flow dynamicsto understand where a fire goes inside a compartment inmicrogravity, how fire-fighting agents are transported,and how the agents interact with air and fuel. Attention is now focused on understanding the physics and chemistry of putting out fires for applica-tions on Earth as well as in orbit. The space shuttle'sResearch-1 mission (STS-107, scheduled for launch inearly 2003) will take the first step in this new directionwith the Water Mist (MIST) experiment. FrankSchowengerdt, director of the Center for CommercialApplications of Combustion in Space (CCACS), a NASA commercial space center located at the ColoradoSchool of Mines, Golden, explains that his group is try-ing to understand the fundamentals. They want to under-stand how fire extinction depends on water particle size,water concentration, droplet distribution, and radiationfrom the fire. The CCACS is part of the Office ofBiological and Physical Research's Space ProductDevelopment Division. When the center was first set up, Thomas McKinnon, a CCACS chemical engineer, said he hadalways puzzled over just exactly how water puts out afire. Five years ago, he wasn't taken seriously. However,McKinnon \u2014 now the principal investigator for MIST\u2014 persisted and developed more analytical experimentsand models, believing that one cannot make significantadvances without studying fundamental science. A scien-tist might get lucky in a trial-and-error approach, but itcould be very expensive. Schowengerdt and his col-leagues want to know the absolute minimum amount ofwater required to put a fire out so that cleanup is easier, A U.S. Navy firefighting instructor leads firefighters in battling an oil-fed fire during a military training session.

Navy ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 36COMBUSTION SCIENCE4 postfire damage is reduced, and flight crews are exposed to fewer toxic by-products. Exact details of the physics of extinguishing fires with water mist are difficult to determine, largelybecause the reactions happen so quickly in Earth's gravi-ty. Droplets settle, so a controlled, uniform cloud of themcan't be maintained to see what happens as the flameinteracts with them. In microgravity, the droplets remainsuspended, so researchers can better see what is takingplace. The CCACS has conducted extensive tests on theground, including some at a drop tower facility at theSchool of Mines, but experiments in orbit have moretime to progress and experience less turbulence, so nowit is time to move upward. Schowengerdt and his groupare looking at a lot of different things that can be donefar better aboard spacecraft. The CCACS's work is getting attention from potential terrestrial users, including the Federal AviationAdministration, the U.S. Navy, computer system opera-tors, and even restaurants. NASA also is interested inMIST as part of a larger investigation into fire safetyaboard spacecraft.Floating Flame Balls Paul Ronney didn't set out to look for flame balls: they came as a complete surprise. It happened in1984 when Ronney, a combustion researcher, was usingthe 2.2 Second Drop Tower at Glenn Research Center(GRC) in Cleveland, Ohio. He pressed a button and senta can of burning hydrogen falling down a 24.1-meter(79-foot) shaft. For 2.2 seconds it plummeted in afreefall, with a 16 mm movie camera recording theaction. Ronney knew that flames did strange things inlow gravity, which is why he was doing the experiment,but he wasn't prepared for what he saw in the film roomlater. The flames had broken apart into tiny balls thatmoved around like UFOs. No one had ever seen any-thing like it, but the flame balls were real, as proved inlater experiments. Flame balls are the weakest known flames. Compared to a birthday candle's 50 to 100 watts, a flameball produces only 1 to 2 watts of thermal power. Theyburn using very little fuel. It's almost as if a hydrogen-burning flame's last line of defense as it approachesextinction is to draw itself into a simple ball. Ronney,who is now a mechanical engineering professor at theUniversity of Southern California, Los Angeles, believesthat flame balls will help him and others crack theunsolved mysteries of burning. Despite the fact that com-bustion powers our automobiles, generates our electrici-ty, and heats our homes, there's much about it we don'tunderstand. The Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-Number experimentinvestigates small flame ballsthat can ignite in the lean fuel-air mixture inside spacecraft.While weak (1 watt versus the50 watts put out by a birthdaycandle), they can last for sever-al minutes and are very difficultto detect. The flame balls in theabove picture are visible onlybecause they were captured inthe dark by cameras withimage intensifiers. In the nor-mal light inside a spacecraft,they would be invisible to bothastronauts and fire detectors.credit: NASA The Combustion Module-2 (CM-2) is scheduled to fly on STS- 107 in January 2003. Originally flown on STS-83 and STS-94in 1997 as CM-1, it was later refurbished and renamed CM-2.Integrated into SPACEHAB for STS-107's upcoming flight,CM-2 will support three combustion investigations: LaminarSoot Processes, Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-Number, and Water Mist. credit: NASADiagnostic Processor Package Video Procesor PackagePowerDistributionPackageANNUAL REPORT 2001-20024COMBUSTION SCIEN Flames are extremely complicated. In an ordi- nary candle flame, for example, thousands of chemicalreactions take place. Hydrocarbon molecules from thewick are vaporized and cracked apart by heat. They com-bine with oxygen to produce light, heat, carbon dioxide,and water. Some of the hydrocarbon fragments eventual-ly form soot. Soot particles can themselves burn or sim-ply drift away as smoke. The familiar teardrop shape ofthe flame is an effect caused by gravity. Buoyancy caus-es hot air to rise, and fresh cool air is drawn in behind it.These processes are what make the flame shoot up andflicker. Flame balls, on the other hand, are simple. The balls form in low gravity, where buoyancy has littleeffect. Oxygen and fuel combine in a narrow zone at thesurface of the ball. Once ignited and stabilized, the flameballs maintain a constant size. Unlike ordinary flames,which expand greedily when they need more fuel, flameballs let the oxygen and fuel come to them. Finally, thefact that flame balls are spherical reduces their dimen-sion to one: the radius of the flame itself. Flameballs are to combustion scientists what fruit fliesare to geneticists; they provide a simple modelfor testing hypotheses and checking computermodels. One of many mysteries about fire is why weak flames go out before their fuel is totallyexhausted. It puzzles physicists and vexesautomakers who want to build clean, efficient\"lean-burning\" engines that run on fuel-air mix-tures with low fuel concentrations \u2014 much like aflame ball. Ronney believes that studying onesystem (flame balls) will help us with the other(cars). Here on Earth, researchers can't study flame balls for long periods. A typical plungedown a drop tower lasts only seconds. So Ronneyis working with NASA scientist Karen Weilandand others at GRC to design the Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-Number (SOFBALL) experi-ment for flight aboard the space shuttle. The appara-tus for the experiment consists of a sealed chamberwhere flame balls can burn for a long time duringa space shuttle mission. When SOFBALL orbited Earth for the first time in April 1997 aboard STS-83, it pro-duced some surprises. Computer models had pre-dicted the flame balls would be small and eitherextinguish or drift into the chamber walls in a fewminutes. Instead, they were two to three timeslarger than predicted and burned for over eightminutes until the experimental system automati-cally extinguished them. Furthermore, although theflames were large, they were the weakest ever seen, emitting little more than 1 watt of thermal power. To further explore these unexpected results the experiment was upgraded, renamed SOFBALL-2, andscheduled for launch onboard STS-107 in early 2003.During the mission, flame balls will be allowed to burnfor 2 to 81 minutes. Instruments will monitor their tem-perature, brightness, heat loss, and the composition oftheir gaseous by-products. Because flame balls are sosensitive to motion, the space shuttle will be allowed todrift during the experiments instead of maintaining posi-tion using its reaction control thrusters. Because this research is so fundamental, it touch- es on many areas related to combustion, including lean-burning engines for cars and airplanes, explosion hazardsin mine shafts and chemical plants, emissions from carsand coal-burning plants, and arson investigations. Theapplications of the knowledge that may result fromSOFBALL are many. Originally flown on STS-83 and STS-94 in April and July 1997, respectively, Laminar Soot Processes (LSP) studies the fundamental mechanisms ofsoot production, one of the main by-products of combustion. A better under-standing of soot processes in flames will help scientists develop better firesafety methods for spacecraft. This image shows a laminar jet diffusionflame, created by flowing fuel-like propane through a nozzle and igniting it.LSP-2 is scheduled to fly aboard STS-107 in January 2003. 1 4 2 the movement of fluids here on Earth is everywhere.Outside, gravity guides the flow of rainwater intostreams and rivers and the cascades of water intofountains. It also shakes seemingly solid groundinto rippling waves of soil during an earthquake. Athome, it causes bubbles of carbon dioxide to float tothe top of a glass of root beer and a pot of water togo into a rolling boil when the bottom surface getshot enough. In industry, gravity affects the mixingof molten materials, as denser liquids naturally driftto the bottom of the mixture. In fact, gravity hassuch a strong influence over fluids that it can maskevidence of other forces affecting fluid behavior.Scientists in the microgravity fluid physics program conduct studies under conditions that mini-mize the effects of gravity so they can observe theeffects of other phenomena, such as surface tensionand capillary flow. Through their work, these scien-tists are striving to improve the ability to predict andcontrol the behavior of fluids, including gases, liq-uids, plasmas (gases that are capable of conductingelectric currents because they contain free ions andelectrons), and in some circumstances, solids. Fluid physics research in the Physical Sciences Research Division comprises five mainareas: complex fluids, interfacial phenomena,dynamics and instabilities, biological fluid physics, and multiphase flows andphase changes.Experiments in complexfluids involve gases or liq-uids that contain particlesof other substances dis-persed within them. Onetype of complex fluid is acolloid, which is a systemof fine particles suspendedin a fluid. Orange juice andpaint are examples of col-loids. Another complex EEOVERVIEWFLUID PHYSICS5 ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 38Gravity guides the cascades of water intofountains.ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002fluid is a magnetorheological fluid, a colloid in which the viscosity, or resistance to flow, of thefluid can be varied by applying an external magneticfield. Foam, another complex fluid, exhibits featuresof solids, liquids, and vapors, although it is not clas-sified as any of these. Research on interfacial phenomena focuses on how an interface, like the boundary between agas and a liquid, acquires and maintains its shape.Interface dynamics relate to the interaction of sur-faces in response to heating, cooling, and chemicalinfluences. Better understanding of these phenome-na will help humans learn more about how duckfeathers and waterproof tents repel water, how waterspontaneously displaces air in the gaps of a sponge,and other interfacial phenomena. The area of dynamics and instability includes research in drop dynamics, capillarity, andmagneto/electrohydrodynamics. Drop dynamics deal with the behavior of liquid drops and gas bubblesunder the influence of external forces and chemicaleffects. Capillarity refers to effects that depend onsurface tension, such as the shape a liquid takeswithin a container or what causes a drop to take aspherical shape in microgravity. Research in magne-to/electrohydrodynamics involves the study of theeffects of magnetic and electric fields on fluid flows. The biological fluid physics subdiscipline includes the flow of fluids and the transport ofchemicals in biological systems and processes. Theflow of blood in the cardiovascular system, the flowof air in the liquid-lined capillaries of the lungs, andthe stretching of DNA in an evaporating droplet ofliquid are a few examples. Research on multiphase flows and phase changes, such as the transition from a liquid to agas, focuses on complex problems of fluid flow invarying conditions. Scientists are seeking to add totheir currently limited knowledge of how gravity-dependent processes, such as boiling and steam con-densation, occur in microgravity. They are alsostudying the diffusion of energy and matter throughliquids and gases. A more thorough understanding ofthese phenomena may lead to improvements in manyapplications, such as air conditioning and refrigeration.

Inaddition to contributing to fundamental knowledge offluid phenomena, the results of fluid physics investiga-tions conducted in orbit should yield beneficial applica-tions for long-duration missions, exploration of otherplanets, and the enhancement of life on Earth. In fiscalyear (FY) 2001, the program funded a total of 114 prin-cipal investigators. Of these, 97 were working onground-based research projects and 17 were working onflight projects. In FY 2002, the program funded 122principal investigators, including 26 who are working onnew ground-based research projects. The new investiga-tions were chosen in November 2001 from among 209proposals submitted in response to a NASA ResearchAnnouncement (NRA) in microgravity fluid physicsreleased February 2001. For a list of selectees, visit theWorld Wide Web at http://spaceresearch.nasa.gov/ general_info/OBPR-01-229_lite.html . In addition, a list of all ongoing fluid physics research projects, along withthe names of the investigators conducting the research, isprovided in Appendix A. Researchers learned about new funding opportu- nities through NASA and new directions and advances inmicrogravity fluid physics research when they gatheredfor the Sixth Microgravity Fluid Physics and TransportPhenomena Conference, held August 14-16, 2002, inCleveland, Ohio. At the conference, which is held everytwo years, Eugene Trinh, the director of the PhysicalSciences Research Division, discussed how the micro-gravity environment of orbit presents opportunities forunique and exciting research. He specified that suchopportunities allow investigators to directly participate indeveloping the enabling technologies for space explorationand to exploit the unique experimental environment ofspace to unravel outstanding fundamental scientific mys-teries. He explained that because convection and hydro-static pressure are minimized in this environment, it isespecially conducive for research involving classical flu-ids and transport processes, fluid-phase thermophysicalproperties, surface and interfacial phenomena, morpho-logical stability and pattern bio-fluids staticsand dynamics, and multiphase systems and engineering.Because sedimentation is also greatly reduced in micro-gravity, it is conducive to research involving multiphasefluid physics, colloid dynamics, self-assembly andmesoscale structures, container-free experimentation, andspray and dust cloud dynamics. Current and potentialresearchers also learned about the schedule for the latestNRA in microgravity fluid physics. It was released inSeptember 2002, with proposals due in December 2002and selections to be made in 2003. Attendees also heardabout the latest advances in research in their discipline,which were shared by current principal investigators (PIs).Nearly 70 fluid physicists from North America, Europe, and Asia (including several NASA PIs) partici-pated in the Microgravity Transport Processes in Fluid,Thermal, Biological, and Materials Sciences IIConference held in Banff, Alberta, Canada, in October2001. The main objective of the conference, which wassponsored by NASA and the National ScienceFoundation, was to exchange technical information andideas among scientists and engineers working in micro-gravity fluid, thermal, biological, and materials sciences.The conference addressed the growing interdisciplinaryaspects of microgravity research and technology devel-opment and provided a forum for exploring opportunitiesfor collaborative research activities. Attendees heard Acrivos Awarded President's National Medal of Science Principal Investigator Andreas Acrivos, of City College of the City University of New York, New York City, was recently awarded thePresident's National Medal of Science for his lifelong study of fluiddynamics. The medal, awarded by U.S. presidents to nomineesreviewed by the National Science Board, is the nation's highesthonor given for lifetime achievement in scientific research. Acrivos was recognized for his work in helping to establish the field of suspension mechanics (the mechanics of substances sus-pended in but not dissolved in a fluid) and for his contributions tomodern theories of fluid mechanics and convective heat and masstransfer. He is widely recognized as being a pioneer in his field.

They also heard presenta-tions on materials processing, crystal growth, proteincrystal growth, and electrostatic and electromagneticphenomena. Fluid physics PI Satwindar Sadhal, of theUniversity of Southern California, Los Angeles, chairedthe conference. The next Microgravity TransportProcesses Conference will be held September 14-19,2003, in Davos, Switzerland. Several notable papers describing the work of fluid physics PIs were published in prestigious journalsin FYs 2001 and 2002, including Science and Physical Review Letters . Of particular note were \"Real-Space Imaging of Nucleation and Growth in ColloidalCrystallization,\" by U. Gasser, Eric R. Weeks, AndrewSchofield, P. N. Pusey, and D. A. Weitz, in Science 292 (April 13, 2001), 258-62; \"Droplet Growth byCoalescence in Binary Fluid Mixtures,\" Prasad V . Gopalkrishnan, Steven D. Hudson,Alex M. Jamieson, Michael A.

Goree, in Physical Review Letters 88 (May 27, 2002). Flight Experiments Several notable milestones were achieved with flight experiments in the microgravity fluid physics pro-gram in FYs 2001 and 2002. During this time, the firstfluids experiment on the International Space Station(ISS) was flown, an experiment was conducted on aspace shuttle mission, and several other experimentsmade significant advances toward being ready for flightaboard one of the two platforms. Making these flightsand advances possible were new hardware units designedfor better physical or remote access with the capabilityfor later reuse by related experiments. The first microgravity fluid physics experiment to fly on the ISS was Physics of Colloids in Space(PCS). The experiment was carried to the station onSTS-100 in April 2001, installed in the EXPRESS(EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to SpaceStation) Rack 2 (see page 73 for more information onEXPRESS) once onboard the station, and run for 2,400hours between early June 2001 and February 2002.Conceived by PI David Weitz, of Harvard University,and Co-Investigator (Co-I) Peter Pusey, of the Universityof Edinburgh, PCS involves observing the formation ofcrystals and other structures from colloidal particles(particles suspended in a fluid). In microgravity, thesedelicate structures can form without interference from convective flow or sedimentation. For PCS, eight samples were selected from three types of colloids: binary colloids, which contain particlesof two different sizes and may help explain the behaviorof alloys; colloid and polymer mixtures in which thepolymer makes the colloid particles slightly attractive networks, the net-work that holds Jell-O together. These samples wereused to study fundamental questions regarding thephysics of colloids, colloid engineering (using colloids asprecursors for building new materials), and the propertiesof new materials and their precursors. The PCS appara-tus, a versatile and sophisticated digital imaging and lightscattering instrument, allows for the change-out of sam-ples once back on Earth with no need for realignment ofits precision diagnostics. With the help of this hardware, more than 80 percent of the scientific goals for the experiment wereachieved. Potential payoffs include improvements in theproperties of paints, ceramics, and food and drug deliv-ery products, and possibly the development of photonicband-gap materials, an entirely new class of materialsthat can passively affect the properties of light passingthrough them. Due to its success and to the versatility ofthe instrument itself, the PCS hardware is being refur-bished for use by a second investigator and will refly asPCS+ in 2003. In addition, the procurement and assem-bly of a whole new test section has been initiated,enabling PCS-3 to be conducted in 2004 on the heels ofPCS+, with a reduction in launch mass. Further in thefuture, such swap-outs of hardware with completely newcolloid experiments could be continued beyond PCS-3. PCS-2, a related future flight experiment also conducted by Weitz and Pusey, will be inserted and runin the new Light Microscopy Module (LMM), a micro-scope adapted for conducting in-orbit colloid and fluidphysics experiments. The LMM was designed by a teamin the microgravity fluid physics program for use withthe Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR), which will be the fluidphysics facility in the Destiny laboratory of the ISS. (Formore information about the LMM and the FIR, see page74.) Also slated to use the LMM are the ConstrainedVapor Bubble (CVB) experiment, led by Peter Wayner,of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; the Physics of HardSpheres Experiment-2, led by Paul Chaikin, of PrincetonUniversity; and the Low V olume Fraction ColloidalAssembly experiment, led by Arjun Yodh, of theUniversity of Pennsylvania. CVB investigates heat con-ductance in microgravity as a function of liquid volumeand heat flow rate to determine the transport processcharacteristics in a curved liquid film. The other twoexperiments investigate various aspects of the nucleation,ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 42FLUID PHYSICS5 growth, structure, and properties of colloidal crystals in microgravity and the effects of micromanipulation upontheir properties. The Collisions Into Dust Experiment-2 (COL- LIDE-2), led by Joshua Colwell, of the University ofColorado, Boulder, was conducted on shuttle missionSTS-108 in December 2001. The experiment studied theeffects of low-velocity particle collisions, which arebelieved to be responsible for the formation of planetaryrings and protoplanetary disks. The experiment wasdesigned to collect data on the outcome of low-velocitycollisions of selected projectiles into a fine powderthat simulates regolith, the dust and small particlesthat coat the surfaces of most bodies in the solar system. The first flight of the experiment, on STS-90 in April 1998, revealed the unanticipated result that below a certain threshold energy, no material is ejected as aresult of the impact. For COLLIDE-2, researchersexpanded the space in which the data were collected tofind the threshold energy. They also characterized thevelocity of the ejected material as a function of impactvelocity and energy. The COLLIDE team has analyzed the results and learned that when the projectiles impact the powder atspeeds below about 20 cm/second, the projectiles adhereto the target. This seems to support the hypothesis ofplanetesimal growth, which states that planets grew fromsmall, solid, celestial bodies that may have existed at anearly stage of the development of the solar system. Theteam also found that at speeds above 20 cm/second, pro-jectiles are dispersed, making growth of planetesimalsdifficult. The results from impacts at these faster speedssuggest that planetesimal growth is assisted by aerody-namic or electrostatic forces acting on the slow-movingparticles knocked off in the impact. The third Mechanics of Granular Materials (MGM-III) experiment is scheduled to fly on space shut-tle mission STS-107 in January 2003. MGM-III, led byPI Stein Sture and Co-I Nicholas Costes, both of theUniversity of Colorado, Boulder, will use the micrograv-ity environment to test the response of columns of sandto compression and relaxation, forces that occur duringearthquakes and landslides when compacted soil loosensand flows much like a liquid. In MGM's two previous flights, the researchers measured the effect of gravity on friction between grainsof dry sand and discovered strength and stiffness proper-ties of the sand columns to be many times greater thanconventional theory predicted. For MGM's third flight,they will study the behavior of water-saturated sand indrained and undrained conditions using three sand sam-ples in nine different experiments. The experiments are expected to provide the first-ever measurements of sandstrength and stiffness properties and induced pore waterpressures when pressure is cyclically applied andreleased, similar to the strong ground motions observedduring earthquakes. The science team will use a new specimen- reforming technique, which will prove beneficial tofuture space station research as it enables the reuse andretesting of the same sample many times under con-trolled initial conditions. The team will also be able touplink instructions for the hardware and downlink resultsfrom the experiments live, a capability developed in FY2001. Among the many applications of this research, dis-coveries from MGM investigations may help engineersdesign more earthquake-tolerant buildings, increase safe-ty in mining operations, aid coastal and offshore engi-neering projects, and help researchers understand thegeology of various planetary bodies for space explo-ration initiatives. The experiment Investigating the Structure of Paramagnetic Aggregates From Colloidal Emulsions(InSPACE) will be conducted in the MicrogravityScience Glovebox (MSG) on the ISS and will be carriedto the station on STS-114 in 2003. (For more informationabout the MSG, see page 76.) InSPACE, led by AliceGast, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, willhelp researchers find out how a pulsed magnetic fieldwill affect the fluid suspension in a magnetorheological(MR) fluid. The study of these colloidal systems is beneficial to the development of \"smart fluids\" for use in feedback-controlled devices, such as shock absorbers and suspensionsystems, and as colloidal modifiers in protein crystalliza-tion or colloidal suspensions. Techniques that Gast's teamis using can potentially be used to induce two-dimensionalcrystallization of proteins in these suspensions. In FYs2001 and 2002, the InSPACE team measured the propertiesof membranous, fluid-filled pouches called vesicles that were coated with two-dimensional crystals of the proteinstreptavidin, which crystallized from a solution. Theyworked to study how changing the solution's pHchanged the crystal structure and growth pattern. Thisprocedure allowed the team to obtain regularly orderedprotein arrays on a large spherical support. Such orderedsurfaces may be used as templates for crystallizing othermolecules or as a framework for biosensor arrays,arrangements of probes that integrate a biologicalcomponent with an electronic component to yield ameasurable signal. When InSPACE is flown, three different particle concentrations will be tested. The MSG will providecameras and video recorders to view and store the scienceANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002data. Observation of the microscopic structures willyield a understandingof interplay betweenmagnetic, interfacial, to scien-tists' understanding of thecomplex properties of MRfluids, enabling methods ofimproving their characteris-tics and their implementationin devices such as vibrationdamping The History (SHERE), of scheduled tobe conducted in the MSG onthe ISS in 2004. The experi-ment will allow for the studyof the extensional, or stretch-ing, viscosity of fluids inmicrogravity. Most measure-ments of the flow of non-Newtonian fluids, whichhave a high viscosity, or resistance to flow, have beenperformed using highly elastic or \"stiff\" materials suchas polymer melts, which can easily be elongated in nor-mal gravity without sagging. By performing similarexperiments on different materials in a long-term micro-gravity environment, it will be possible for the first timeto get accurate measurements of the extensional viscosityof more \"mobile\" fluids such as polymer solutions, sus-pensions, and liquid crystalline materials. This characterization of flow, or rheological data, will allow designers of both space- and ground-basedmaterial processes to create improved models of complextwo- and three-dimensional fluid flows. Non-Newtonianfluids are significant in many industrial processes such asfiber-spinning, spraying, and film-coating operations.Gaining insight into the extensional viscosity of thesefluids is also important to understanding the complexfluid phenomena involved in the stability and breakup offluid jets; enhanced oil recovery; and turbulent dragreduction for advanced aircraft, boats, and submarines. InFY 2001, scientists flew SHERE twice on the NASAKC-135 airplane using hardware that is compatible withthe space shuttle's Middeck Glovebox. In FY 2002, theSHERE team worked to ensure that the experimentwould be physically and electronically compatible withthe larger glovebox aboard the ISS. The Boiling Experiment Facility (BXF) will accommodate experiments on the ISS beginning in 2004.Boiling is an important field of study since it can effec-tively move energy away from a surface through thephase change of liquid to gas, thus cooling the surface.Because boiling is a preferred mode of heat transfer inspace, what investigators learn about boiling in micro-gravity can be applied to thermal management of manyspacecraft systems, such as supply systems for life-sup-port fluids and electronic packages powering variousinstrumentation and control systems. Two experiments are planned for the BXF in 2004. The first will be the Nucleate Pool BoilingExperiment (NPBX), led by Vijay Dhir, of the Universityof California, Los Angeles. Dhir will study bubble nucle-ation, growth, and departure during the boiling processand the resultant cooling that is achieved under micro-gravity conditions. NPBX will increase in complexityfrom experiments using a single bubble to ones usingthree inline bubbles to ones with five bubbles placed ona two-dimensional grid. In FY 2001, Dhir's team devel-oped two-dimensional bubble growth models; in FY2002, they developed models in three dimensions. Thesecond experiment slated for the BXF is the MicroheaterArray Boiling Experiment (MABE), led by Jungho Kim,of the University of Maryland, College Park. The study, The study of magnetorheological fluids in the InSPACE experiment could benefit such feedback- controlled devices as shock absorbers in automobiles. 5FLUID PHYSICANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 44FLUID PHYSICS5 which will help scientists know how much cooling can be achieved in a fluid in microgravity, will use two 96-element microheater arrays, 2.7 mm and 7.0 mm in size.This arrangement will allow local heat fluxes to be meas-ured as a function of time and space. During FYs 2001and 2002, the MABE team gathered data on the boilingprocess in microgravity, Earth's gravity, and hypergravityusing a heater array on a KC-135 airplane flying in aparabolic pattern. Results to date indicate that boiling inmicrogravity is dominated by the formation of a largeprimary bubble whose size is on the order of the heater. The Granular Flow Module (GFM) will be oper- ated in the FIR beginning in 2007. The GFM is a multi-user mini-facility that will accommodate investigationsstudying the flow of granular materials, which aresubstances made up of solid particles distributed in a gasor liquid. (For more information on the GFM, see page74.) The first three investigations to be conducted on theGFM are Microgravity Particle Segregation inCollisional Shearing Flows (\u00b5gSEG); Studies of Gas-Particle Interactions in Microgravity Flow Cell, alsoknown as Solids Interacting with a Gas in a MicrogravityApparatus (SIGMA); and Gravity and GranularMaterials (GGM). The objective of the \u00b5gSEG experi-ment, conducted by PI James Jenkins and his team atCornell University, is to test mechanisms of granularsegregation that are not controlled by gravity. The\u00b5gSEG hardware features rotating cylindrical walls withbumps that have specific shapes and collision propertiesand a digital video that records particle trajectoriesbetween the rotating walls. The experiment is scheduledto run in 2007. It will isolate and investigate differencesin the inertia of spheres with different masses but equaldiameters as they tumble in the cylinders. It will alsostudy the geometric segregation of spheres with differentdiameters but equal masses. In FY 2001, the \u00b5gSEGteam constructed a prototype shear cell for parabolicflight on the KC-135 aircraft. In FY 2002, the shear cellflew on the KC-135 to test its operation and imaging fea-tures, and team members undertook theoretical studiesand developed numerical programs to predict results offuture experiments. SIGMA, conducted by PI Michel Louge and his team at Cornell University, studies collisions among par-ticles, which can transfer a significant amount ofmomentum within and at the boundaries of the particleflow. The experiment, scheduled to run in 2008, will usethe same hardware as \u00b5gSEG. In FY 2001, the SIGMAteam designed a prototype cell to be tested on the KC-135 aircraft flying in a parabolic pattern. In FY 2002, theteam flew the prototype on the KC-135 and demonstrat-ed that the cell can produce the desired granular flows. GGM, conducted by PI Robert Behringer, of Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina, willexplore the fluctuation of forces in low-density and high- density granular samples. The effects of the fluctuationrange from clustering in low-density samples to chains ofparticles jamming at high density. In the flight hardware,the sample volume is the space between two concentriccylinders of different diameters with one stationary endplate and one end plate that rotates to drive a shearingmotion. The granular particles are 0.8-mm glass beads.The volume of the beads will vary from gaslike (withrelatively long distances between each bead) to liquidlike(with the average gap between each bead less than thediameter of the bead). Findings from the experiment,which will be run in 2008, may lead to better under-standing of the mechanical behavior of granular materi-als and how to avoid such industrial problems as cloggedchutes, silo failures, and poorly mixed medicinal compo-nents. In FY 2001, the GGM team completed studies ofgranular friction by using a novel shaking device, studiesof texture and force propagation, and studies of gaslikegranular systems. In FY 2002, the team developed a sci-ence requirements document and presented it at a scienceconcept review. Highlights Learning the Basics of \"Moon Face\" Studying the fluid physics of cells may bring answers to why astronauts get all stuffy in the head andpuffed up in space. John Tarbell, of Pennsylvania StateUniversity, is using a cell culture model to find the causeof and countermeasures for \"Moon face,\" the shift of flu-ids to the upper body of astronauts in orbit that givesthem a rounder, fuller face. Tarbell is studying the endothelial cell layer, which lines blood vessels from the aorta to the capillar-ies. These cells provide the principal barrier to transvas-cular transport, the passing of water and solutes betweenblood and underlying tissue. On Earth, these cells arecontinuously exposed to the mechanical shearing forceand the pressure imposed by blood flowing over theirsurfaces, and they are adapted to this environment. Whenthe cardiovascular system is placed in microgravity,which affects fluid flow, pressure in the blood vesselschanges, and the shearing force is eventually reduced.These adaptations increase the endothelial cell layer'shydraulic conductivity, or its ability to transport waterand solute, inhibiting the layer's barrier properties and,Tarbell proposes, allowing the transvascular transportthat causes fluid to shift in humans in microgravity. In ground-based research using a tissue culture model of the endothelial transport barrier, Tarbell hasshown that a sudden increase in vascular pressure, whichoccurs in the human face in microgravity, induces an earlyadaptive response. The endothelial layer's resistance to theANNUAL REPORT 2001-20025FLUID PHYSIC flow of water from blood into tissue space increases for about an hour after the pressure increases. This naturalcontrol mechanism tends to limit facial swelling. Theground-based experiments further demonstrate that afteran hour of altered pressure, the resistance begins to dropsubstantially, leading to a condition in which there isexcessive leakage of fluid from the blood to the tissue.This loss of control of transvascular transport exacer-bates facial swelling. Tarbell is studying the biomolecular mechanisms that mediate the response of the endothelial transportbarrier to changes in pressure. His group has found thatthe loss of resistance to fluid transport from blood to tis-sue can be blocked completely by inhibiting the forma-tion of nitric oxide (NO) using pharmacologic agents.Findings in Tarbell's research related to NO tie in tostudies by other NASA scientists in biomedicine and fun-damental space biology who are studying how NOaffects fluid-related conditions experienced by astronautssuch as bone blood flow, orthostatic intolerance (light-headedness upon standing or sitting up), cardiac atrophy,and disruption of circadian rhythms (natural sleeppatterns). Tarbell also has found that the loss of resistance can be reversed by elevating intracellular levels of cyclicadenosine monophosphate, a signaling hydraulic conductivity of endothelial cells.Tarbell says, \"The results suggest a variety of possibleapproaches for pharmacologic intervention to regulatehydraulic activity of endothelial cells in microgravity,\"thereby reducing the degree of \"Moon face\" and otherfluid-related conditions experienced by astronauts.On Earth, Tarbell's research findings could pro- vide insight into the importance of maintaining normaltissue homeostasis and knowledge about how its break-down becomes critical in various diseases that includeatherosclerosis, a degenerative disease of arteries thatunderlies heart attacks and strokes; diabetic retinopathy,leakage of albumin into the retina; and when tissue isinflamed, the transvascular transport that leads toswelling in tissue. Sor ting Out the Ef fects of Turbulence on Par ticle Dynamics From dust storms to volcanic eruptions to indus- trial spray applications, the movement of particles by aturbulent fluid, such as air, can have far-reaching conse-quences. Turbulent pockets of air form eddies, swirlingaround any particles that cross their paths. However,gravity, rather than the force of the eddies, controls mostof the dynamic behavior of the particles on Earth, pullingthem through the turbulent air pockets at a relatively fastrate. What happens to those particles if the effects ofgravity are temporarily removed? Principal InvestigatorChris Rogers and his team at Tufts University are study-ing how glass and ceramic particles disperse in air, andthey are trying to understand the role gravity plays intheir motion. A number of studies of particle dynamics in tur- bulent media had already been conducted using com-puter-based numeric simulations, but in 1996, Rogersand his team set out to conduct experiments using realparticles and real turbulence in order to improve uponcomputer models and to better understand the dynamicphenomena of particles in motion. They started with aquasinumeric technique, which combines mathematicalcalculations and experiment data on a real fluid, a chan-nel of water flowing in one direction. A unique system developed at the Tufts University Fluid Turbulence Lab uses a laservelocimeter probe comprising four laser beams to pro-vide instantaneous measurement of the speed of thewater and calculate what would happen to a particle ofa given mass experiencing gravity acting in a givendirection with a given amount of force. The particle'sacceleration and position in the fluid are then mim-icked by the movement of the laser beam, whichbounces through the fluid as if the beam were the par-ticle. Rogers's team was able to vary the force ofgravity on the model to begin to define gravity's rolein the path the particles took through the fluid. Butthey realized that to validate and further refine resultsof both the computer-based and quasinumeric simula-tions, they would have to conduct their experiments inmicrogravity. Astronauts experience a coldlike sinus and nasal stuffiness and a rounder, fuller face called \"Moon face\" (shown at right) when the barri-er that normally prevents fluid from passing from blood vessels intosurrounding tissues on Earth becomes ineffective in microgravity. credit: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 46FLUID PHYSICS5 the experiment on NASA's KC-135 air-craft involved mounting a large boxwith the rig inside to the floor. Thissetup didn't account for the effectsof outside turbulence encountered bythe plane, so the team redesigned theexperiment rig. On subsequentflights, a smaller apparatus was used,allowing researchers to release therig, which included the experimentchamber and the video recordingequipment, during freefall, when itwould float in midair. The method for creating turbu- lence for the glass and ceramic par-ticles inside also became moresophisticated. Little fans with modelairplane propellers on them blewthe air into the corners of the rig,where it spread along the walls,keeping the particles from stickingto the walls. This rig provided theteam with the turbulence andfreefall conditions they were look-ing for. What they found when ana-lyzing the video bore out theoriesbased on computer simulation. Small particles, when subjected to turbulence in microgravity,showed what is called preferentialconcentration, which computer mod-els had predicted. As the particlesentered the turbulent air, they werethrown about by eddies in the flowfield. The eddies, spinning the parti-cles about, tended to throw the parti-cles into the spaces between theeddies. Here the particles clusteredinto strings; they preferentially con-centrated between the eddies wherethey could move more easily throughthe air. But what about larger particles? Simulations of turbulence had shownthat heavy particles would agglomeratejust as smaller ones would. However, asimulation has its limitations, andRogers and his team had their doubtsabout whether tests on real particles inturbulent flow fields would show thesame agglomeration behavior. Just past the peak of the KC-135's parabolic flight path, the experiment rig floats in midair, free from the effects of gravity. Temporarily removing some of gravity's influences allowsresearchers to study the effects of turbulence on airborne particles. credit: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-20025FLUID PHYSIC Video from the KC-135 flights confirmed what the simulation had predicted: in microgravity, big parti-cles would also agglomerate due to the influence of theturbulent flow field. In order to test out this theory oneven larger particles, however, longer tests in micrograv-ity will be necessary. For a better understanding of the fluid properties in the experiment, Rogers returns to the quasinumerictechnique using the laser system and the model waterchannel. He hopes to be able to draw some conclusionsabout the fluid properties in his experiment based onwhat he has observed in the KC-135 experiments on par-ticle dynamic properties. The next set of investigations inthe KC-135 may help Rogers answer questions regardinghow the total amount of turbulence is affected by addingparticles to the experiment apparatus and how the turbu-lence generated in microgravity compares to turbulencemeasured on the ground. T iny Bubbles Cr eate Better Cooling Put a clear glass pot of water on the stove and turn the burner to high. Soon the heat turns liquid waterat the bottom of the pot into bubbles of steam that almostinstantly detach and zip to the surface. Cooler waterflowing in behind is heated in turn to become moresteam, and the entire pot boils as the transition of liquidto gas carries heat away from the bottom of the pot. Now imagine that gravity's effects are turned off. Without buoyancy to make lighter materials float to thetop, the bubbles don't detach; rather, they stay in placeand grow. The heat is not carried away from the bottomof the pot, and the heating element melts and fails alto-gether. The stove, a power plant, a computer, or anyother active system \u2014 even a human \u2014 must shed heator break down. Principal Investigator Vijay Dhir, of the University of California, Los Angeles, wants to understandboiling so it can be used safely in systems operating in a microgravity environment. One of the most efficientmeans of cooling, boiling has been a fundamental part ofmodern industry since the dawn of the Steam Age, yet itis poorly understood in many respects, especially wheregravitational effects are involved. Dhir has designed the experiment Investigations Associated With Nucleate Boiling Under MicrogravityConditions to allow precise control of the locationswhere bubbles form and the timing of their release \u2014something that the design of earlier microgravity experi-ments did not permit. Silicon wafers, 10 centimeters (4inches) in diameter, make this control possible. Thewafers have \"designed surfaces\" with tiny wells only 4,7, or 10 microns wide and 100 microns deep, backed bytiny heating elements. The wells serve as nucleationsites, where water heats to boiling and then turns tovapor. Each well or combination of wells can be heatedto produce a single bubble or an array of bubbles. Thepatterned surfaces will allow Dhir and his colleagues tostudy boiling across a range of controlled variations, toquantify how heat moves from a solid surface into liquidand then to vapor, and to understand how heat transfer inone tiny area can affect transfer in another. While flying his experiment aboard the KC-135 aircraft in a parabolic pattern in 2000, Dhir discoveredsomething that no one else has studied: that while a sin-gle bubble can grow to dangerously large sizes in lowgravity, the release of even a few small bubbles can cre-ate radically different flow patterns in a liquid, inducingadditional bubbles to depart. Moreover, Dhir's computer simulations show that if the bubbles are neatly lined up like beads on astring, they have little effect on each other. But if theirpositions are staggered, they merge and induce circula-tion and lift forces that move other bubbles away fromthe heating surface as well. To Dhir, this discoverysuggests that patterning a surface with deliberate,microscopic variations might induce proper boiling in a low-gravity heat-transfer system. To find out, Dhir will need to run his experiment in a long-term microgravity environment onboard theISS. Then, in 5 to 10 years, Dhir expects that the resultof a successful ISS investigation could be design codesthat engineers would use to optimize surfaces in a boil-ing system for a range of applications both on Earth andin space. Such understanding could help thermal engi-neers design space applications ranging from nuclearelectric propulsion systems powering space vehiclesbetween planets to electrical power plants and coolingsystems operating efficiently in the fractional gravities onother planets. A large bubble grows as smaller ones come in contact and surface tension breaks to let the gas pockets join. Theentire sequence took about one-eighth of NASAt=0.000s t=0.096s t=0.112s t=0.128s4 mmo you ever wonder how small a comput- er will be 50 years from now? Or what new tools adoctor will have to detect cancer? Or what newtechnology might replace CD players? Or if we willhave the instruments we need to make deep spaceexploration possible? Fundamental physicists are the people finding the answers to these questions. But they don't start their search by asking about technology. They start with much more basic questions about how the universe works.Science is driven by human curiosity about nature. In the study of fundamental physics, scientists wish to uncover and understand the basicunderlying principles that govern the behavior of theworld around us. Fundamental physics research,therefore, establishes a foundation for many otherbranches of science and provides the intellectualunderpinning needed to maintain and further de-velop our highly technological society. Researchers in the discipline have two quests that motivate laboratory studies and experiments inspace. One of these quests is to explore and under-stand the fundamental physical laws governing matter,space, and time. Deep examination of the smallestand largest building blocks that make up the uni-verse will yield a better understanding of the basicideas, or theories, that describe the world. The spaceenvironment provides access to different space-timecoordinates and frees experimenters from the dis-turbing effects caused by gravity on Earth. The second quest is to discover and under- stand the organizing principles of nature from whichstructure and complexity emerge. While the basiclaws of nature may be simple, the universe that hasDDOVERVIEWFUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS6 ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 48Fundamental physicists start with basic ques-tions about how the uni-verse works. What theyfind can help answermyriad other questions,such as, \"how small willcomputers be 50 yearsfrom now?\"arisen under these laws is amazingly complex and diverse. By studying nature apart from the influenceof Earth's gravity, we can better understand how theuniverse developed and how best to employ theseprinciples in service to humanity. The pursuit of these quests will grea- tly benefit society in many ways over thelong run. For example, the study of physicallaws and natural principles with unprece-dented precision requires advances ininstrumentation that provide the foundationfor tomorrow's breakthrough technologies.These advances contribute to the competi-tiveness of American industry and furthersupport and enhance the presence ofhumans in space. To address the two long-term quests of the program, research is currently beingpursued in three areas: gravitational andrelativistic physics, laser cooling and atomic physics, and condensed matter physics. Gravitational and rel-ativistic physics is the study of gravity's influence onthe physical world and of Einstein's Theory ofGeneral Relativity, which puts gravity at the heart ofthe universe's structure. Laser cooling and atomicphysics is the study of atoms and how they manifeston a small scale the same fundamental laws thatgovern the universe on a large scale. Condensedmatter physics, in which matter is also studied at anatomic level, specifically examines the properties ofatoms in liquids and solids, the states of matter inwhich atoms are condensed. OVERVIEW6FUNDAMENTAL PHYSIC By studying nature in microgravity, fundamen-tal physicists hope tobetter understand howthe universe developed. ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002Scientists who study condensed mat- ter physics examine the properties of atoms in liquids (such as water)and solids (such as ice), the statesof matter in which atoms are con-densed. Scientists are drawn to study the transition between states,such as melting or evaporating,because certain universal behaviorsare found in the properties of the system as the transition is performedunder carefully controlled conditions.ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 50FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS6 Program Summary Almost 200 fundamental physicists and other scientists representing 82 universities and 12 countriesgathered in Pasadena, California, in May 2001 for theSecond Pan-Pacific Basin Workshop on MicrogravitySciences. The workshop was a four-day opportunity forresearchers who hailed mostly from countries that borderthe Pacific Ocean to share their latest work related tomicrogravity and the space environment. Topics dis-cussed ranged from fundamental research in physical,chemical, and biological processes to cross-disciplineresearch and applied technology innovations. Participantsalso attended outreach events at the California ScienceCenter, in Los Angeles, and learned firsthand how educa-tion and outreach can play a key role in explaining thebenefits of their work to the public. This year's workshop, the largest-ever gathering of microgravity scientists from the Pacific Rim, washosted by the Association of Pacific Rim Universities,the National Society of Microgravity Science andApplication of China, and the Japan Society of MicrogravityApplication. Other participating organizations includedNASA, the National Space Development Agency ofJapan, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the CanadianSpace Agency, and the Russian Space Agency. The workshop also served as the annual meeting for the microgravity fundamental physics program, giv-ing investigators within the discipline an opportunity topresent research developments and results and to shareideas with others in the field, especially with many inter-national colleagues. Leading off the plenary talks,Principal Investigator (PI) David Lee, of CornellUniversity, Ithaca, New York, described the excitementof the 1970s race to discover superfluidity in liquidhelium-3. PI Randall Hulet of Rice University, inHouston, Texas, presented the final plenary talk,discussing his recent observation of Fermi pressure inultracold lithium-6 atoms and showing pictorially the differing behaviors of bosons and fermions (two isotopesof the element). Charles Elachi, newly installed as thedirector of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) inPasadena, California, described during his address at theconference banquet how the microgravity fundamentalphysics program fits into JPL's ambitious plans for spaceexploration. The fundamental physics sessions educatedattendees about techniques for using liquid helium as atest bed for fundamental theories, observations of quan-tum behavior in clouds of atoms cooled to within a mil-lionth of a degree of absolute zero, and funding forresearch to explore fundamental physics. The 2002 NASA Workshop for Fundamental Physics in Space was held May 9-11 in Dana Point,California. More than 75 scientists attended the workshopto report on progress in their research and to learn about new opportunities for research funding. Mark C. Lee, theenterprise scientist for fundamental physics at NASAheadquarters, described the discipline as currently thestrongest he has ever known it, based on the large num-ber of proposals in each subdiscipline that had beenreceived in response to the 2001 NASA Research Ketterle Awarded Nobel Prize Principal Investigator Wolfgang Ketterle, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was awardedthe 2001 Nobel Prize for physics for his researchinvolving ultracold atoms that form a new type of mat-ter. The physicist shared the prize with Eric Cornelland Carl Wieman, both of the Joint Institute ofLaboratory of Astrophysics and the National Instituteof Standards and Technology, in Boulder, Colorado. The award cites the researchers' achievements and fundamental studies of Bose-Einstein condensates, apeculiar form of matter predicted by Albert Einsteinbased on research by Indian physicist SatyendraNath Bose. The Royal Swedish Academy ofSciences, which awards the Nobel Prize, said thethree scientists have caused atoms to \"sing in uni-son.\" Through their research, atomic particles wereinduced to have the same energy and to oscillatetogether in a controlled fashion. Laser light has thesequalities, but researchers have struggled for decadesto make other matter behave this way. The break-through research has potential uses for extremelyprecise measurements and may lead to microscopiccomputers and ultraprecise gyroscopes that coulddramatically improve aircraft Ketterle's the number ofNobel laureates NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-20026FUNDAMENTAL PHYSIC Announcement sponsored by NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research. He explained that such announce-ments would occur each year to permit scientists to enterthe program at short intervals, with each year's announce-ment focusing on a slightly different theme in fundamen-tal physics. The theme for the 2001 announcement wasgravitational and relativistic physics, laser cooling andatomic physics, and low temperature and condensedmatter physics. Fundamental Physics Discipline Scientist Ulf Israelsson, of JPL, followed Lee's remarks by outliningthe changes in the NASA and JPL organizations that willaffect the discipline. He described how the new team ofthe Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR),now headed by Mary Kicza, is interpreting the recommen-dations of the Research Maximization and Prioritizationtask force, which assembled in 2001 to assess priorities forall OBPR-funded research. Additionally, Israelsson pro- moted the guest investigator opportunity for fundamentalphysics scientists, which provides for invited scientists toparticipate in already-approved flight experiments, includ-ing the development of a flight instrument's mission. PI David Lee presented results from his group's measurements of decay times for species of impuritiestrapped in a matrix of solid helium. At the low tempera-tures involved in the measurements, the change of popu-lations observed implies that the reactions take place byquantum tunneling mechanisms, rather than by normalchemical reactions. The results demonstrate the possibili-ty of developing valuable energy storage methods inthese systems. PI John Thomas, of Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, described his team's efforts to coolclouds of Fermi atoms into a state of degeneracy, charac-terized by atoms that are stripped of their electrons andby very great density. The research group hopes that theproper conditions can be reached to initiate a pairing ofthe Fermi atoms that will cause the clouds to becomesuperfluid. Many additional topics of considerable interest were described in the presentations. Attendees at theworkshop heard about progress on the Primary AtomicReference Clock in Space flight experiment, severaltechniques useful for studying laser-cooled atom sam-ples, mass interferometry methods for measuring thegravitational constant G and for developing sensitivegyroscopes and gravity gradiometers, and phase transi-tions in an array of ultracold atomic spins. These andother investigations discussed were funded throughNASA Research Announcements (NRAs). NASA releases announcements of opportunities for new research grants at regular intervals to maintain aproductive research community working at the cutting edge of the science topics in fundamental physics. Newideas for research broaden the topics and update thestanding of the supported experiments. An NRA (NRA-00-HEDS-02) soliciting proposals in fundamentalphysics was released in February 2000, and selectionsfor funding were announced in November 2000, at thebeginning of fiscal year (FY) 2001. Based on peer review of the 109 proposals sub- mitted in response to the 2000 NRA, 36 ground-basedinvestigations were selected for funding, with seven ofthose in the new area of biological physics. In addition,five flight-definition investigations were chosen fordevelopment. These flight projects included two guestinvestigations for the first mission of the LowTemperature Microgravity Physics Facility on theInternational Space Station (ISS), one investigation ingravitational physics, and two experiments in laser cool-ing and atomic physics. A complete list of the 42 select-ed research projects from the 2000 NRA can be found onthe World Wide Web at ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/ pressrel/2000/00-183a.txt . An NRA for subsequent funding (NRA-01- OBPR-08-E) was released in January 2001. Theannouncement solicited research seeking knowledge thatwill expand understanding of space, time, and matter andenhance understanding of physical, biological, and chemi-cal processes associated with fundamental physics.Proposals were due in April 2002, and selections of inves-tigations to be funded will be announced in early 2003. The fundamental physics program supported a total of 53 ground-based investigations and 14 flightinvestigations in FY 2001 and 67 ground-based investi-gations and 13 flight investigations in FY 2002. Flight Experiments The flight program in fundamental physics achieved several milestones this year. As development of the Low Temperature Microgravity Physics Facility(LTMPF) planned for the ISS progressed, experimentsslated to fly in the facility also moved forward. For itsfirst mission, scheduled for 2008, the LTMPF willaccommodate experiments that investigate superfluidhelium. When helium is cooled to extremely low temper-atures (nearing absolute zero, -273\u00b0C) it remains in aliquid state but exhibits some very unusual properties.For instance, it has no resistance to flow, so it can leakthrough tiny holes that even gaseous helium cannot pen-etrate, and it demonstrates infinite heat conductivity.Helium in this state is called a superfluid. Studying thecritical point for superfluidity, the conditions of tempera-ture and pressure at which the transition occurs, hasANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 52FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS6 proved the transition to be an excellent model of the physics of other transitions between states, such as theliquid-gas critical point. The Critical Dynamics in Microgravity Experiment (DYNAMX), scheduled for the first LTMPFmission, will study how liquid helium becomes a super-fluid while being driven far from equilibrium by a heatcurrent. In FY 2001, DYNAMX passed its preliminarydesign review and was granted limited authority to pro-ceed. Only minor design changes remained before thedetailed design definition of the flight hardware wouldbe complete. In FY 2002, the final DYNAMX flight pro-totype and flight hardware were designed, and the draw-ings and flight assembly procedures were more than halfcomplete. The Microgravity Scaling Theory Experiment (MISTE), also planned for the first LTMPF mission, willtest scaling law predictions for thermophysical propertiesof systems near liquid-vapor critical points. During FY2001, MISTE passed its preliminary design review, andthe MISTE team began fabricating an engineering modelof the flight hardware for testing. The team continued itscollaboration with Mission Research Corporation ondeveloping a small, pneumatic low-temperature valve forrepeated actuation at liquid helium temperatures. Theground-based experimental cell was redesigned to permitmore accurate measurements, and a MISTE web site(http://miste.jpl.nasa.gov ) was created for outreach pur- poses. In FY 2002, the MISTE team developed a novellow-temperature valve to meet flight requirements. The team also acquired new data using the redesignedground-based experimental cell. Based on these data,they revised their mathematical model, and predictionsare now being tested against experimental measurements. Two other superfluid helium experiments will be conducted during the first LTMPF mission. TheEnhanced Heat Capacity of 4He Near the SuperfluidTransition (CQ) experiment and the CoexistenceBoundary (COEX) experiment will use the DYNAMXflight instrument and the MISTE instrument, respective-ly, in different ways from their primary experiments tomaximize scientific return on the instruments. The CQexperiment will explore the effect of heat flux on thesuperfluid transition of helium. In FY 2001, the experi-ment was approved and funded as a guest experimentwith DYNAMX. In FY 2002, the flight definition of theCQ experiment was completed, and the review board ofthe CQ requirements definition review recommendedthat CQ receive authority to proceed to flight. COEX measures densities of a sample of helium-3 as it approaches very near to the vapor-liquid criticalpoint. The data should help to determine precisely theparameters for the theoretical description of the proper-ties of that critical point. In FY 2001, COEX was acceptedby NASA as a guest experiment using the MISTE flighthardware, and the COEX team determined preliminarydata. In FY 2002, the COEX science requirements docu-ment and experiment implementation plan were prepared. Diagram of the proposed PARCS laser-cooled space clock.

Experiments have also been selected for the sec- ond LTMPF mission, planned for 2010: The BoundaryEffects on the Superfluid Transition (BEST) experimentwill determine the effects of boundaries on the thermalconductivity of superfluid helium near the critical transi-tion, and the Superconducting Microwave Oscillator(SUMO) is a project to develop an oscillator that will be used to test theories about relativity and in otherapplications. The program currently supports two flight exper- iments to develop atomic clocks using laser-cooledatoms. Atomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeperson Earth, but gravity limits their performance. Developmentof a laser-cooled atomic clock that could take advantage of a microgravity environment would enable an improve-ment in accuracy by perhaps as much as a hundredfold.An atomic clock on the ISS could serve as a primary fre-quency standard, providing labs around the world withthe premier definition of the second and perhapsenabling experiments in fundamental physics that werenot possible previously. Such a clock also could aid indeep space navigation and navigation on Earth byimproving the accuracy of the Global PositioningSystem (GPS). Scientists working on the Primary Atomic Reference Clock in Space (PARCS) project are develop-ing a cesium-beam atomic clock to operate on the ISS. Inthis clock, atoms of cesium will be made to oscillate between energy states by exposure to a specificmicrowave frequency. To precisely measure the atoms'oscillation, or \"ticking,\" they will be slowed by extremecooling and trapped within the instrument by the micro-gravity environment of orbit. In December 2000, the PARCS project passed its requirements definition review, which involved definingthe engineering aspects of conducting the experiment inspace. Also, a number of components have been eitherdesigned or fabricated in prototype form. The shuttersfor the atom beam, which are critical to operation of thePARCS clock, have been fabricated, and preliminarytesting of them has begun. These shutters must be non-magnetic, produce a minimum of vibration, have anaperture larger than 1 cm, operate at a rate of at least 1hertz (one cycle per second), and should survive morethan 1 million usages. In addition, collimators (devicesfor the trapping and detection of lasers), plus a prototypetrapping chamber, have been constructed of titanium, anda prototype for the clock is under development. Amicrowave synthesizer with a performance that meetsthe need for the PARCS instrument has been constructed,and measurements of phase noise are under way. A sec-ond synthesizer design, which incorporates features thatbetter match it to PARCS and uses a number of space-qualified components, is nearing completion. The team of scientists working on the Rubidium Atomic Clock Experiment (RACE) is attempting to fur-ther improve the accuracy of laser-cooled microgravity A new design for the RACE rubidium microgravity clock was developed this year. This design, shown in the figure above, simplifies the trapping and shutter mechanisms while maintaining a high throughput of cold atoms, min-imizes the requirements on the local oscillator, and eliminates errors due to vibrations. RACERACE credit: NASA, redrawn by Jacky Edwardsclocks. By using rubidium instead of cesium, thisexperiment addresses one largest sources errorsin a clock: the fre-quency shift of atomscaused by cold collision.The collision shift of rubid-ium is 50 times smaller thanthat of cesium, allowing forbetter stability and thusmore accurate determinationof the frequency required tocause the atoms to oscillatebetween energy states. Theteam has also developed atechnique to cause theatoms to be launched inquick succession from thebase of the clock, passthrough one microwaveregion, where their energystate is measured, continuetoward the top, and passthrough another microwaveregion, where they areremeasured they fallagain. The stabil-ity of the atoms' oscillationbefore they collide is pro-portional to the launch rate,so juggling the atoms allowsa higher accuracy to bemaintained. In FY 2002, the RACE team rebuilt theclock to improve its energy state detection system. An experiment in condensed matter physics, the second Critical Viscosity of Xenon Experiment, CVX-2,was manifested on space shuttle mission STS-107. Theexperiment, which measures the change in viscosity of afluid near its critical point, is laying the groundwork fora method of predicting the viscosity of various fluids.Work progressed on readying the CVX-2 hardware forintegration into the shuttle. This experiment builds onresults from a previous successful flight on shuttle mis-sion STS-85 in August 1997. Highlights Glimpses of Cold Stars and New Laser Power Scientists have successfully used lasers to cool a cloud of lithium atoms sufficiently to observe unusualquantum properties of matter, including some that couldshed light on the behavior of stars or lead to improvedtools for space navigation. Randall Hulet and his team atRice University watched as an extremely cold lithiumcloud resisted condensation in much the same way that stars will collapse to a certain point and no further afterthey have used up their fuel and succumbed to gravity.The scientists also have been able to make the atoms in alithium cloud move in perfect, nondissipating waves, oneatom following after another, which could be an impor-tant first step in making an atom laser for clock and navi-gation applications. Both of these observations were made as the team attempted to achieve the unique conditions thatwould induce lithium atoms to behave collectively, or asa quantum system. Under certain conditions, atomsexhibit wavelike behavior, that is, sometimes an atomexists not as an object occupying a single point but ratheris spread out over a region of space, known as the wave-length of the atom. Since atoms of the same material alldisplay the same type of wave, under unique conditionsof very low temperature, the waves lock together andmove almost like troops marching in formation. In thisstate, the cold and dense cloud of atoms is known as aBose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and it exhibits unusualproperties similar to those of a superfluid, another quan-tum state of atoms. ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 54FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS 6 This is a three-dimensional rendering of an image of a matter-wave soliton train. Each peak in the train is Bose-Einstein condensate, a collection of atoms cooled to a temperature of nearly absolute zero. Solitonare localized bundles of waves, constrained to move in only one dimension, which propagate withoutspreading. Advanced optical communications systems employ solitons because ordinary light pulsesspread and require frequent signal boosters. The atom-wave solitons shown in the figure may someday buseful as the atom laser input to an atom interferometer.credit: Randall HuANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002Although a number of elements have been found to undergo this transition, lithium is of particular interestbecause it exists in two different forms, or isotopes: lithi-um-7, which consists of atoms known as bosons, andlithium-6, which has atoms known as fermions. Bosons,it turns out, reach the BEC transition at higher tempera-tures than fermions. Hulet's challenge was to cool thefermions to temperatures low enough to reach the BECstate. In an inspired technique, Hulet and his team cooleda cloud that was a mixture of the two isotopes so that thebosons, which readily respond to cooling, acted as refrig-erants, further cooling the fermions. While trying to achieve a BEC using this mix- ture of lithium atoms, the team got a surprising snapshotof a phenomenon that occurs in stars \u2014 Fermi pressure.Named for Enrico Fermi, a Nobel Laureate noted for hiscontributions in nuclear physics, Fermi pressure has beentheorized as the mechanism for star stabilization thatkeeps white dwarfs and neutron stars from collapsingpast a certain point. These stars are dense, compactobjects created when normal stars use up their fuel, cool,and succumb to the forces of gravity. As the Rice team cooled the lithium cloud to 500 nanokelvins (500 billionths of a degree above absolutezero, -273\u00b0C), the bosons compressed, because multipleatoms can occupy the same energy level. However, thefermions resisted being crowded together and did notcondense further, confirming the theory that they cannotoccupy the same energy level due to Fermi pressure.Thus, Hulet's tiny atom cloud became a quantum modelfor star behavior, even though the atoms in the two sys-tems exist in vastly different spatial and energy scales.Images of the lithium cloud have revealed some fascinat-ing insights into this force responsible for stabilizingstars. Hulet has also documented another quantum effect with a cooled cloud of lithium-7 atoms. The Ricegroup manipulated the cold atoms to form tidy bundlesof waves, called solitons, which retained their shape andstrength. Normally, when a wave forms \u2014 whether inwater, light, or clouds of atoms \u2014 it tends to spread outas it travels. Not so with a soliton wave, which maintainsits perfect shape without spreading. In their laboratory, Hulet and his team confined lithium atoms with magnetic fields, cooled them withlasers to one billion times colder than room temperature,and confined them in a narrow beam of light that pushedthem into a single-file formation. The atoms formed aBose-Einstein condensate, and Hulet's team was able toobserve a \"soliton train\" of multiple waves. The solitontrain produced by Hulet's team comprised individual seg-ments of this condensate that continued to preserve theirquantum mechanical phase with respect to each other,despite being segmented. The atom-wave solitons that the Rice University scientists observed could be used inadvanced atom lasers, which have beams made of atomsinstead of light photons. Hulet says atom lasers might have many applica- tions that few have envisioned, such as improving instru-ments that study gravity variations to locate and measureunderground water, minerals, oil, caves, and volcanicmagma on Earth. By measuring levels of undergroundmagma, for example, scientists may be able to predictvolcanic eruptions. The technology could also be used ona spacecraft to map the ocean believed to lie beneath theicy crust of Europa, one of Jupiter's six known moons. Atom lasers could also lead to other advances, including improvements in atomic clocks and computers.New clocks could be designed using the ultracold lithiumatom beams so that the atoms collide less frequently,which would allow even greater accuracy. More preciseclocks would help digital communications systems andimprove deep space navigation. Using an atom laser tofabricate computer chips with single atomic layer controlwould make computers run faster. Star quakes on YourLab Bench, Anyone? Spinning ultracold sodium gas in the laboratory, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) created a gas cloud that is a model of some quirkypulsar star behavior. As the atom cloud spins, it becomesriddled with tiny whirlpools, like those suspected ofcausing \"starquakes\" in space. The laboratory demonstration of these vortex structures in ultracold atom clouds is related to puzzlingglitches observed by astronomers in the otherwisesmooth, rapid rotation of pulsars. A pulsar is a type ofneutron star, a remnant of a dying star, one of the densestobjects in the universe. Glitches in pulsar rotation arecalled starquakes and may occur when whirlpools, orvortices, form or decay. Because the gas cloud observed in the laboratory was 100,000 times thinner than air, while a pulsar isabout ten thousand trillion times denser than air, onemight expect different behavior from the two systems.But both the sodium gas cloud and pulsars are superflu-ids, a state of matter in which a substance can flow with-out friction. Scientists know that as superfluids rotate,they form quantum whirlpools that reflect the smallestpossible increase in rotation for the gas cloud or for thepulsar. Previously, scientists in laboratories had seen only one or a few whirlpools in a superfluid; WolfgangKetterle, a physics professor at MIT, and his research6FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICteam made the first direct observation of so many vor- tices. Ketterle described the moment as \"breathtaking.\"The team was amazed as hundreds of whirlpools werecreated in the ultracold, fragile gas and the cloudremained stable. To achieve the star model, Ketterle and his team cooled the sodium gas to less than one millionth of adegree above absolute zero (-273\u00b0C). At such extremecold, the gas cloud converts to a peculiar form of mattercalled a Bose-Einstein condensate, which was predicted75 years ago by Albert Einstein. No physical containercan hold such ultracold matter, so Ketterle's team usedmagnets to keep the cloud in place. They then used alaser beam to make the gas cloud spin, a process Ketterlecompares to stroking a ping-pong ball with a featheruntil it starts spinning. The spinning sodium gas cloud,with a volume of one-millionth of a cubic centimeter,much smaller than a raindrop, developed a regular pat-tern of more than 100 whirlpools. Once the quantum system was achieved, team members were challenged by how to photograph thewhirlpools, which were too small to be seen except withspecial magnification. They switched off the magnetscontaining the gas cloud, allowing it to expand to 20times its original size. This made thewhirlpools large enoughto be photographed. Asthe cloud expanded,however, gravity madeit fall, and the team hadto take the picturesquickly. These gravita-tional limitations wouldbe absent micro-gravity environmentthat is available toresearchers on theInternational SpaceStation. The sodium cloud is an example ofa designer quantumsystem that scientistscan use to model some-thing in hadno opportunity toexplore or manipulatethem until now. How Fast Does the World Turn? A discovery that may someday help measure how clouds and earthquakes change Earth's rotation hascome from an experiment that made friction-free heliumwhistle. liquid helium-3 in ahollow, doughnut-shaped container, NASA-funded scien-tists at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, pro-duced a whistling sound that got louder or quieterdepending on the container's orientation relative to theNorth Pole and Earth's rotation. In principle, smallchanges in Earth's daily rotation rate will also vary thevolume of the whistle. Although Earth completes its rota-tion every 24 hours, clouds and the motion of Earth'scrust can make any given day slightly longer or shorter.These findings might provide an unusual new way tomeasure such changes. The Berkeley team, led by PI Richard Packard and Co-Investigator S\u00e9amus Davis, both professors atUC Berkeley, cooled the vessel filled with liquid helium-3 to a temperature nearly 1 million times colder thanroom temperature. At this temperature, the liquid heliumbecomes a superfluid, a state of matter in which a sub-stance experiences no friction, so the liquid can flow ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 56FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS6 The picture above shows images of the gas clouds in four different states of rotation.

The liquid in the doughnut- shaped container acts like a single, supergiant atom withbehavior that is dictated by the strange rules of quantumphysics. This latest discovery that the helium can act as one giant atom builds on the team's previous research. In1997, they discovered the quantum whistle when theypushed helium through a single perforated membranebetween two superfluid-filled chambers. This experimentdemonstrated a phenomenon called the Josephson effect:as they tried to push the fluid through the holes, each1/500th as wide as a human hair, the fluid jiggled to andfro. The vibration frequency increased as they pushedharder on the fluid. They used the world's most sensitivemicrophone and ordinary headphones to hear thevibrations, which made an oscillating, whistlingsound. In their latest research, the researchers put two thin membranes, each with an array of more than 4,000tiny holes, at opposite sides of the doughnut to divide thesuperfluid. When they tried to push the fluid through theholes with electrostatic pressure, it did not flow in thedirection they were pushing. Instead, it flowed in a strange, oscillating pattern, again producing a whistle. Asthe fluid flowed through the doughnut-shaped vessel, thewhistle got louder or softer, depending on the vessel'sorientation with respect to Earth's axis of rotation. In essence, the team has demonstrated that two weak links (established by the two perforated mem-branes) behave as one weak link (established by the sin-gle membrane) whose properties are influenced byEarth's rotation. The successful demonstration of thiseffect has been a goal of low-temperature physicists formore than 35 years. The promising new research mightlead to extremely precise gyroscopes to help navigatefuture NASA spacecraft. This experiment used a tinyamount of helium-3, but by using a much larger amount,an ultrasensitive gyroscope might be created. Earth is probably too noisy an environment to realize the full potential of this technology, and Packardlooks forward to maybe one day listening to his quantumwhistle in the best possible environment for the experi-ment \u2014 a free-floating satellite, which could have zerovibration. 6FUNDAMENTAL PHYSIC Doughnut-shaped hardware for this experiment included two thin membranes, each with thousands of tiny holes, at opposite sides of the doughnut to divide the fluid. When researchers tried to push the fluid through the holes withelectrostatic pressure, it flowed in a strange, oscillating pattern, producing a whistle.

Materials scientists are always on thelookout for ways to improve the propertiesof materials and to create materials that havenew properties for new purposes. A material's properties, such as how strong, how durable, or how poor or effi-cient a conductor it is, are determined by notonly by its chemical composition but also byits crystalline structure. The crystallinestructure is established as a result of themethod and conditions under which thematerial is produced. For example, if a mix-ture of liquid metal and ceramic particles issolidified at one speed, those ceramic parti-cles may congregate in undesired ways, causing theprocessed material to crack easily or be brittle. If,on the other hand, the same molten mixture is solid-ified at a different speed, the ceramic particles maybe more evenly distributed throughout the solidifiedmaterial, lending it desirable strength. By learning how to alter the conditions of material processing toget desired properties, investigators may be able tomanufacture materials with more useful propertiesthan are currently available.TT Materials scientists are on a never-ending quest to take exist-ing materials such as glass,metals, or ceramics and makethem stronger, lighter, cheaper,or better. Microgravity researchis helping researchers under-stand the fundamentals of materi-als and enabling them to developnovel solutions to technologychallenges in industry and in thespace program. OVERVIEWMATERIALS SCIENCE7ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002Because most solid materials are formed from a liquid melt or a vapor, the productionprocesses for most materials include steps that arevery heavily influenced by the force of gravity.Typical gravity-related effects that take place inmaterials processing include buoyancy-driven con-vection (fluid flow caused by temperature-drivendensity differences in a material), sedimentation(settling of different materials, liquid and/or solid,into distinct layers), and hydrostatic pressure (differ-ences in pressure within a quantity of material dueto the material at the top weighing down on thematerial at the bottom). Observing, monitoring, andstudying material production in microgravity is ben-eficial because it allows researchers to isolate someof the underlying mechanisms that govern howmaterials are formed and to determine how thosemechanisms affect the structure and properties ofthe material. This can increase our fundamentalunderstanding of materials and possibly result in improved methods for processing materials on Earth. During fiscal years (FYs) 2001 and 2002, three new research initiatives were proposed for themicrogravity materials science program: radiation shielding, advanced space propul-sion, and in-space fabrication andrepair for long-distance spaceexploration.

To providesolutions to the new problems such missions will pose,the three new research topics of radiation shielding,advanced space propulsion, and in-space fabrication andrepair for long-distance space exploration were added tothe materials science program and included in NASAResearch Announcements (NRAs) in FYs 2001 and2002. Researchers from universities, industries, and gov-ernment laboratories across the country compete forfunding in the materials science program by submittingresearch proposals in response to NRAs. Each proposalis evaluated by a peer review committee and selected onthe bases of scientific merit, applicability of the projectto NASA's goals, and feasibility. Learning how to protect astronauts from the increased exposure to harmful radiation outsideEarth's sheltering atmosphere will be critical to space-flights to other planets and habitation on those planets.Materials science is contributing to this effort throughresearch aimed at understanding the radiation shieldingeffectiveness of existing materials, as well as through research focused on developing new materials. An NRA(NRA-01-OBPR-05) was released August 24, 2001,soliciting proposals for ground-based research opportuni-ties in radiation shielding and biomaterials. Proposalswere due November 27, 2001. Another NRA (NRA-02-OPBR-02) highlighting ground-based research opportu-nities in space radiation biology and space radiationshielding materials was issued August 30, 2002, withproposals due November 25, 2002. Selections for bothNRA grants will be posted on the World Wide Web(WWW) at http://spaceresearch.nasa.gov/research_ projects/selections.html . The advanced space propulsion initiative is focused on identifying materials that will meet the chal-lenging requirements of the high-temperature and high-energy systems needed to carry vehicles deeper intospace. These advanced propulsion systems may involvechemical, nuclear, electromagnetic, magnetic, solar ther-mal, directed plasma, and photonic components. Theresearch initiative for in-space fabrication and repair sup-ports NASA's plans for construction in space and onother planets. The goals of this effort are to reduce themass of materials carried into space, to create designsthat will enable and facilitate the fabrication of large Sharon Cobb of Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, shows how a cylindrical sample will be inserted into the Materials Science Research Rack-1 furnace for processing aboard the InternationalSpace Station.

A general NRA covering all the disciplines with- in the Physical Sciences Research Division (NRA-01-OBPR-08) was issued December 21, 2001. It includedmaterials science opportunities (NRA-01-OBPR-08-F)and a special solicitation of proposals for developingmaterials for advanced space propulsion (NRA-01-OBPR-08-G). Proposals for the NRA in microgravitymaterials science were due July 16, 2002, with selectionsto be made in December 2002. Proposals for the propul-sion NRA were due October 1, 2002, with selections tobe made in spring of 2003. A total of 89 principal investigators (PIs) received research grants for FY 2001-2002. A list of allongoing materials science research projects, along withthe names of the investigators conducting the research, isprovided in Appendix A. A complete list of funded proj-ects may also be found on the WWW at http://research.hq. nasa.gov/code_u/code_u.cfm . A new cycle of NRA preparation began at the Fifth NASA Microgravity Materials Science Conference,held June 25-26, 2002, in Huntsville, Alabama. The con-ference attracted more than 268 attendees and served tospark further scientific interest in materials research inmicrogravity. Papers and posters featuring work currentlysponsored by the program were presented. The twoNRAs released in 2001 and the upcoming NRA due to bereleased in December 2002 were discussed. Oral presen-tations were selected to highlight mature research and thenew research directions in the program. These new research directions or initiatives are prompted by NASA's vision of future space exploration.If long-duration, crewed space flights are to be madepossible, new or improved technology will be needed foreach initiative. The FY 2002 NRA includes a specialfocus theme of Materials Science for Advanced SpacePropulsion. This technology will help NASA's visionbecome a reality. Ron Litchford, of the Marshall SpaceFlight Center (MSFC) Transportation Directorate high-lighted this announcement at the conference in a plenaryaddress. The importance of supporting the NASA andMSFC program in propulsion was further emphasized toall conference attendees in the banquet speech byMichael Houts, also of the MSFC TransportationDirectorate, which focused on materials requirements fornuclear-fueled space missions. Workshops in FY 2001-2002 were also organ- ized to support the new research themes. The MaterialsScience for Advanced Space Propulsion Workshop washeld October 8-10, 2001, in Huntsville, Alabama, toprovide input for the propulsion NRA. Attendeesbrainstormed possible mate-rials needed to develop newpropulsion systems that willenable the space program toexpand the frontiers ofspace. The Space Radiation Shielding Materials Workshoptook place April 3-5, 2002, at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Experts inengineering, space andnuclear physics, technology,materials science, and radia-tion safety gathered to developa comprehensive understanding of design methods andrequirements related to the design of advanced spacecraftand space habitat radiation shielding. The In-Space Manufacturing of Space Transportation Infrastructure Workshop was held June 11-13, 2002, at MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama.Sponsored by the NASA Exploration Team, the work-shop brought together a variety of engineering andmanufacturing specialists, aerospace contractors, and members of the academic science community to address strategies for developing a robust in-space transportationinfrastructure that might eventually include permanentrefueling stations and maintenance platforms in space.Attendees analyzed NASA's goals to determine itsneeds for materials advances. Several notable invitations were extended to participants in the microgravity materials science pro-gram in FY 2002. In August, Ken Kelton, ofWashington University, St. Louis, Missouri, was invitedto deliver a plenary lecture at the 11th InternationalConference on Rapidly Quenched Metals, at OxfordUniversity, Oxford, England. His research deals withthe solid-state precipitation process of oxygen, one ofthe major impurities in electronic grade silicon, and assuch, one of the remaining limiting factors to furtherprogress of the advancement of personal computers. Inhis lecture, to be published in the PhilosophicalTransactions of the Royal Society, Kelton outlined anew theory of so-called coupled-flux nucleation. Keltonis using nucleation in liquids held below their freezingpoints to validate his theories, and the work will culmi-nate in experiments on the International Space Station(ISS). Preparatory ground-based research is being donein the electrostatic levitator at MSFC. The importanceof the work is further demonstrated by the fact that, inaddition to NASA, the National Science Foundationand industry partners are helping to sponsor this work. Designed to isolate experi- ments inside the MicrogravityScience Glovebox, theg-LIMIT apparatus will is of MSFC, an invited talk at the International Symposium on OpticalScience and Technology on \"Magnetic Microspheres forTherapeutical Co-authoredby Konstantin Mazuruk, Universities Space ResearchAssociation, the paper dealt with the possible use ofmagnetic microspheres for in-situ hyperthermia therapy for cancerous tumors. Maria Zugrav and William Carswell, both of the University of Alabama, Huntsville, gave a conferencepresentation at the Microgravity Transport Processes inFluid, Thermal, Biological, and Materials SciencesConference II held in Banff, Alberta, Canada, September30-October 5, 2001. The presentation, titled \"VaporTransport Growth of Organic Solids in Microgravity andUnit Gravity: Some Comparisons and Results to Date,\"summarized and reviewed four years' worth of workstudying materials for potential applications in theemerging field of optoelectronics. This exciting area ofresearch is the merging of physical, optical, electronic,chemical, and materials sciences to develop newer,faster, and more efficient ways of exploiting the proper-ties of light. Advances can be seen in areas as diverse astelecommunications, manufacturing, aerospace, medi-cine, and entertainment. Zugrav and Carswell are co-PIsfor this investigation. Notable papers published during FYs 2001 and 2002 included \"Crystal Engineering: From Structure toFunction,\" by Mark Hollingsworth, of Kansas StateUniversity, Manhattan, which appeared in Science 295(5564), 2410-13. The paper discussed modern crystal engineering, which allows chemists to control the inter-nal structure and symmetry of crystals and producematerials with useful chemical and physical properties.Another paper, titled \"Triggered Nucleation in Ni 60Nb40 Using an Electrostatic Levitator,\" by Tom Rathz et al.,was accepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science Letters . The article describes the first occasion in which a levitated molten metal drop was forced to solidi-fy by being touched or triggered by an external probe.The purpose of the study is to establish the variety ofnew and potentially useful structures that can be produced by such techniques. Flight Experiments The materials science program conducted its first experiments aboard the ISS in FY 2002. The investiga-tions were carried out in the Microgravity ScienceGlovebox (MSG), a small, contained unit shared amongall the disciplines. Construction of the MSG was com-pleted during FY 2001 by the European Space Agency(ESA). The facility was launched to the space station inJune 2002 and began operations in July 2002. The first investigation conducted in the MSG facility was Solidification Using a Baffle in SealedAmpoules (SUBSA). SUBSA is designed to test whetherthe addition of a baffle, a device used to regulate theflow of the liquid metal in the sample, to the directionalsolidification process, in which the liquid is frozen fromone end of the container to the other, will significantlyreduce convection that naturally occurs in the melt andresult less-segregated alloy materialswith improved properties. Aleksander Ostrogorsky, Polytechnic Troy, New York, is thePI for SUBSA. Once SUBSA was completed, the Pore Formation and Mobility Investigation (PFMI) wasinstalled in the MSG, and its series of experiments wasinitiated. PFMI investigates the formation of undesirableholes, or pores, in a material as it solidifies. The experi-ment was performed using a transparent material calledsuccinonitrile; the transparency of the sample allows theresearchers to directly observe and record how the poresare formed and how they move during processing. PFMIwas led by PI Richard Grugel, of MSFC. During FYs 2001 and 2002, integration activities were under way for a series of experiments to be con-ducted in the MSG in FY 2003. These included fourexperiments from ESA plus four new NASA-sponsoredexperiments. The NASA experiments are theInvestigation of the Structure of ParamagneticAggregates From Colloidal Emulsions, the Coarsening inSolid-Liquid Mixtures-2 experiment, and the GloveboxIntegrated Microgravity Isolation Technology (g-LIMIT)apparatus. Following its on-orbit characterization andtesting, the g-LIMIT device will be made available toany future MSG experiments that have a particular sensi-tivity to low-level vibrations and require special vibra-tion isolation. In addition to the MSG, the Materials Science Research Rack-1 (MSRR-1) will house microgravitymaterials science experiments in the Destiny laboratorymodule of the ISS. The MSRR-1 continued to makeprogress toward completion and installation on the spacestation, as did experiment modules designed for the facil-ity. The MSRR-1 is scheduled for launch to the ISS in2005. For more details about the MSRR-1 and its associ-ated modules, see the International Space Station sectionof this report. During FY 2002, final preparations were com- pleted for integrating the Mechanics of GranularMaterials (MGM) investigation on the STS-107 spaceshuttle flight, scheduled for launch in January 2003. Thisexperiment is a continuation of earlier studies regarding ANNUAL REPORT 2001-20027MATERIALS SCIEN properties of granular materials for the advancement of soil science. The microgravity environment providesdata on granular materials that cannot be collected onEarth, where gravity collapses the materials so quicklythat scientists cannot take measurements. Knowledgederived from the MGM experiments will further theunderstanding of design models for soil movementunder confinement and various stresses. These modelscan be applied to strengthening building foundations,managing undeveloped land, and handling powderedand granular materials in chemical, agricultural, andother industries. The knowledge obtained is alsoexpected to be valuable in understanding technicalissues in fields such as earthquake engineering, terres-trial and planetary geology, mining engineering, andcoastal and off-shore engineering. Highlights Solidifying the Futur e The beautiful structure of a snowflake is a well- known example of the way tiny water droplets freezing intoice form branching crystals. Such branching crystals arecalled \"dendrites\" from an ancient Greek word for tree. As apuddle freezes, however, a continuing dendritic network ofice crystals forming across its surface traps air within thewater, bubbles that remain when the puddle is frozen solid. Many metals and alloys also have dendritic struc- tures. When molten metals or alloys are solidified for com-mercial applications, uniformly distributing the dendrites andcontrolling or eliminating gas pockets are crucial to ensuringthe materials' strength. Principal Investigator Richard Grugel examines his Pore Formation and Mobility Investigation apparatus inside the Microgravity Science Glovebox. The project melted samples of a transparent modeling material to observe how bubbles form in the samples and study their movements and interactions. credit: NASARichard Grugel at Marshall Space Flight Center, investigator for the Microgravity Science Glovebox(MSG) on the International Space Station (ISS), is seek-ing to understand the subtle forces that act on gas bub-bles in molten metals and alloys. Grugel and his teamhave created the Pore Formation and MobilityInvestigation (PFMI) to study how bubbles move andinteract with one another as a material is melted andsolidified in microgravity. On Earth, gravity-driven buoyancy allows the bubbles that form in most liquids to rise quickly to thesurface, pop, and disappear. But in cooling molten metal,bubbles can become trapped in the solid when they arecaught between dendrites or under the solidifying skinon the top of a casting. Such bubbles become pores, ortrapped pockets of gas \u2014 defects that undermine thematerial's strength. Gravity-driven buoyancy so domi-nates the behavior of bubbles on Earth that it hinders sci-entists from observing slighter influences on bubbledynamics. In microgravity, however, buoyancy is mini-mized, and bubbles do not rise and disappear, allowingfor a more complete study of their subtler behavior. The PFMI apparatus flew to the ISS aboard space shuttle mission STS-111 in June 2002. The PFMIthermal chamber, the experiment cameras, and otherdata-collecting devices were installed in the MicrogravityScience Glovebox. The experiment consists of the controlled melt- ing of a transparent material that is structurally similar tometals, in this case, succinonitrile and succinonitrilemixed with a small amount of water. The samples areprocessed inside a thermal chamber installed in theglovebox's workspace. As the sample melts, video cam-eras record bubble formation and movement near the liq-uid-solid interface. Once a sample is loaded into the chamber, an ISS crewmember starts the experiment with the gloveboxlaptop computer and inserts a videocassette into a VCRto record the experiment. As the temperature of a mov-able heater at the far end of the glass tube heats the sam-ple to a maximum of 130\u00b0C (266\u00b0F), the succinonitrilematerial at the end of the sample melts. The heater isthen moved down the length of the tube, melting thesolid in a controlled manner. During this step most of thebubble activity is observed and recorded. Then the direc-tion is reversed, and the tube moves through a cold sec-tion of the thermal furnace (the succinonitrile solidifiesat about 13\u00b0C [55\u00b0F]) where the liquid is directionallyresolidified. Each experimental run lasts 10 to 12 hours. Video plays a crucial role in this experiment, providing a visual record of the way bubbles form,move, and interact as the sample melts and later resolidifies. The science team hypothesized that the bub- bles would travel to the hotter end of the sample throughthe applied temperature gradient, with bigger bubblesmoving faster than the smaller ones. The video confirmedtheir hypothesis, recording the movement of bubblesemerging from the \"centerline crack\" during melting.During the solidification portion of the experiment, bub-ble generation between dendrites was observed as wellas the formation of defects known as \"rat tails.\" The PFMI investigation, with its ability to con- trol and visualize melting and solidification over a widerange of temperature gradient and translation parameters,is enhancing our knowledge of bubble movement andporosity, liquid-solid interface dynamics, and solidifica-tion phenomena. Results from this ongoing study areexpected to benefit materials scientists on Earth as wellas future flight experiment investigators. This is the first use of the PFMI apparatus in the ISS glovebox facility. It has well demonstrated its capa-bility, and Grugel believes its generic design makes it apotential candidate for use in future investigations. Baf fling Flows in Micr ogravity Better semiconductors could mean improve- ments and innovations in technologies for a range offields from telecommunications to medicine to manufac-turing. An experiment recently conducted on the ISSmay play a role in helping industry to grow better crys-tals of semiconductors and bring about a new generationof semiconductor capability. On Earth, buoyancy forces cause a fluid motion called convection that can be undesirable during materialsprocessing. During semiconductor crystal growth in par-ticular, buoyancy forces can cause an uneven distributionof dopants, or impurities used to control the properties ofthe crystals. If dopants are not properly distributed in thecrystal as it grows, the electronic and optical propertiesof the semiconductor are degraded, potentially reducingtheir ability to transmit signals using electrons andphotons. In microgravity, these buoyancy forces can bereduced by a factor of up to 1 million. Nevertheless,analyses of crystals previously grown in space have indi-cated that a weak motion can still persist in a melt evenin microgravity, interfering with the hypothetical convection-free process. SUBSA experiment, run by PI Aleksandar Ostrogorsky, of Rensselaer PolytechnicInstitute, Troy, New York, tests the use of a submergedbaffle during the solidification of semiconductor crystalsfrom a melted material to further reduce or controlconvection in microgravity. For this investigation, tellurium and zinc are added as dopants to molten indium antimonide specimens ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 64MATERIALS SCIENCE7ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002that are cooled by directional solidification to form a sin- gle solid crystal. The baffle placed inside the melt limitsthe length of the solidifying liquid column and aids inreducing convective motion, while microgravity furtherhelps to establish an extremely calm environment thatcan provide scientific data of high precision. Aftergrowth, the distribution of the dopants will be measuredand can indicate the degree of convection that existedduring the growth process. The microgravity environ-ment will enable scientists to enhance their theoreticalknowledge of the crystal growth process. From July 11 to September 10, 2002, Expedition Five's Science Officer Peggy Whitson conducted a seriesof experiment runs for the SUBSA investigation on theISS. SUBSA has the distinction of being the first investi-gation to be conducted in the Microgravity ScienceGlovebox after its installation in the Destiny laboratorymodule on the space station. During experiment opera-tions, a real-time video camera was focused on transpar-ent ampoules containing samples that were melted in theSUBSA furnace. The camera sent images to Earth so thatthe progress of the experiment could be observed directlyby the investigator and his team. Thus, during the meltingof the material, the movement of the liquid-solid inter- face toward a solid single crystal seed could be observedand crystal growth initiated on command when a smallamount of the seed had melted. Movement of the inter-face in the material was observed during both heatingand cooling cycles, and appropriate actions were takenby the experimental team through the command capa-bility of the Telescience Support Center. With the return of the samples to Earth, the effec- tiveness of the baffle will be determined after the sampleshave been comprehensively analyzed. As a bonus to themanagement of the crystal seeding, the real-time imagesallowed scientists to make a direct measurement of thesolidification rate, leading to more accurate data. Theinformation obtained during the SUBSA experimentswill increase the knowledge and understanding of thesolidification process in microgravity and determine howeffective baffles can be in producing quality semiconduc-tors in orbit. Furthermore, data will be used as a guidefor future ground-based research. If the experimentsyield the expected results, directional solidification withthe baffle may become a useful technique for futurecrystal growth in space. 7MATERIALS SCIEN One of the first materials science experiments on the space station, the Solidification Using a Baffle in Sealed Ampoules inves tigation was also the first experiment to be run in the newly installed Microgravity Science Glovebox.

Sometimes the verytools that enable an experiment to be conduct-ed in microgravity can be responsible for thesevariations. Experiment hardware, crewmem-bers, and even the flight vehicle itself cancause accelerations, commonly known asvibrations, that affect microgravity levels anddisturb sensitive experiments. Because acceler-ations can cause convection, sedimentation,and mixing in microgravity science experi-ments \u2014 effects that researchers experimentingin microgravity generally wish to avoid \u2014 informa-tion about accelerations is critical to the interpreta-tion of science experiment results. Accelerationmeasurement is the process by which data thatdescribe the quality of a microgravity environmentare acquired, processed, and analyzed. The data arethen passed on to microgravity principal investiga-tors (PIs) to aid them in analyzing the results oftheir own investigations. Experiments are usually conducted in micro- gravity to avoid the by-products of gravity, such asbuoyancy-driven convection and sedimentation;however, accelerations can strongly influence fluidmotion and the motion of particles or bubbles influids. For example, in materials science experi- ments, heavier elements such as mercury tend tosettle out of solution when subjected to steadyaccelerations. Such settling can also damage proteincrystals grown in biotechnology experiments.Convection due to low-frequency accelerationstends to cause hot gases in combustion experimentsto move. Fluid movement due to accelerations maymask fluid characteristics, such as surface tensionforces, that the experimenter wishes to observe.Mechanical vibrations over a wide range of frequen-cies may cause drastic temperature changes in low-temperature physics experiments, where the samplesare at temperatures close to absolute zero. OVERVIEWACCELERATION MEASUREMENT8 VV For many ISS experiments con stant microgravity conditions aressential. Disturbances such asthose created by a Soyuzspacecraft docking with thespace station can affect experi-ment results. The goal of theacceleration measurement pro-gram is to help researchers tounderstand the impact of accel-erations on their experiments. credit: NAANNUAL REPORT 2001-20028ACCELERATION MEASUREMEN Program Summary Accurate measurement of the microgravity con- ditions during a spaceflight is crucial. PIs use accelera-tion data to determine the influence of accelerations ontheir experiments in order to gain a more accurate pictureof the phenomena under observation. The primary objec-tive of the acceleration measurement program is to char-acterize the reduced-gravity environment of the variousexperiment carriers, such as the space shuttle; Russia'sformer space station, Mir; sounding rockets; parabolic flight aircraft; drop towers; and the International SpaceStation (ISS). Devices used to measure the quality of a micro- gravity environment onboard the various experiment car-riers are known as accelerometers. Several differentaccelerometer units have been developed to meet therequirements of a wide range of experiments and, initial-ly, to fly aboard different experiment carriers. Althoughdeveloped separately, the systems all complement eachother in their measurements. Quasisteady sensors meas- ure the microgravity environment for low-frequencyaccelerations. Vibratory sensors measure higher-frequency accelerations (up to 400 hertz, Hz). Current Space Acceleration Measurement Sensors (SAMS) operational systems include the following: Remote Triaxial System (RTS) \u2014 an ISS vibra- tory system (0.01-400 Hz). There is an RTS in everyEXPRESS (EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments toSpace Station) Rack with Active Rack Isolation Systemcapability and in the Microgravity Science Glovebox(MSG), and there are two RTS Drawers in EXPRESSRack 1. Microgravity Acceleration Measurement System (MAMS) \u2014 an ISS system using a quasisteadysensor (direct current to 1 Hz) and a vibratory sensor(0.01-100 Hz). It is deployed in EXPRESS Rack 1. Triaxial Sensor Head-Free Flyer (TSH-FF) \u2014 used to support ground facilities and aircraft operations(0.01-400 Hz). Parabolic Acceleration Rating System (PARS) \u2014 deployed on the KC-135, PARS provides a ratingnumber to the pilots and acceleration data to theresearchers. It utilizes a TSH-FF sensor head. Triaxial Sensor Head-Ethernet/Standalone (TSH-ES) \u2014 will be deployed for the first time on theFluids and Combustion Facility and the CombustionIntegrated Rack on the ISS. It greatly reduces the sizeand power required by the RTS with the same performance.Roll Rate Sensor (RRS) \u2014 enables the meas- urement of rotational accelerations by using a fiber opticgyroscope. It has been used on sounding rocket andspace shuttle flights. Helping researchers better understand the micro- gravity environment that their experiments will be exposedto and teaching them how to quantify and analyze theimpact of such an environment on their experiments is thegoal of the acceleration measurement program'sMicrogravity Environment Interpretation Tutorial. Forthe fourth and fifth consecutive years, the accelerationmeasurement program offered its tutorial to PIs and proj-ect scientists in the Physical Sciences Research Divisionduring three-day sessions in Cleveland, Ohio, March6-8, 2001, and March 5-7, 2002. The tutorials coveredtopics in accelerometer instrumentation, data collectionand analysis techniques, the quality of the microgravityenvironment on NASA's various carriers, and the impli-cations of those environments for microgravity experi-ments. A 500-page reference book provided participantswith a guide to maximizing the success of their micro-gravity research. PIs were also invited to attend the 20th Inter- national Microgravity Measurements Group meeting, heldAugust 7-9, 2001, in Cleveland. During the meeting,talks about the ISS, the effects of microgravity accelera-tions on scientific experiments, the various accelerationmeasurement systems, and analysis of acceleration envi-ronment data were presented to U.S. and internationalrepresentatives from each of the physical science disci-plines and to other ISS program participants. Proceedingswere made available on CD-ROM. In addition to sharing information with investiga- tors, the acceleration measurement program educatesastronauts about the microgravity environment. OnJanuary 28, 2002, Principal Investigator MicrogravityServices (PIMS), a team that supports researchers withdata analyses of the microgravity environment, conduct-ed a training session with the astronaut candidate class atJohnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. Seventeen astronaut candidates attended and learned about the effect of accelerations on experimentresults, sources of disturbances to the environment,means of maintaining the desired environment, andmethods PIMS uses to analyze and present the envi-ronment data. The session leaders also explained howthe astronauts themselves contribute to the environ-ment (e.g., by exercising) and offered suggestions forhow astronauts can minimize the generation of vibra-tions as they work in spacecraft. Crews for ISS incre-ments 2-9 were also trained in the operation of SAMSand SAMS subsystems as well MEASUREMENT8 PIMS takes data from SAMS and MAMS and displays it in a format that shows researchers when and at what frequency vibrations occur on the ISS.

The training was a condensed versionof the regular three-day training offered by PIMS. Themeeting of the International Microgravity MeasurementsGroup included presentations on predictions of ISSmicrogravity conditions in given situations, improve-ments to space accelerometers, and environment con-cerns of experiments, as well as discussions by membersof the International Partners program. Offering the train-ing and holding the meetings during the World SpaceCongress \u2014 a once-a-decade event attended by thou-sands of scientists, engineers, and space science-interest-ed public from around the world \u2014 made the eventsmore accessible to many more international participants. Flight Experiments In fiscal year (FY) 2001, operation of accelerom- eters aboard the ISS began. SAMS subsystems \u2014MAMS, the RTS, and the Interim Control Unit (ICU) \u2014were ferried to the ISS on STS-100 in April 2001 andinstalled. The MAMS subsystem began operations inMay, and the RTS and ICU subsystems began operationin June. The SAMS subsystems have operated on ISSwith very little need for diagnostics or corrective actions.Most operational trouble has been related to rack or ISSsubsystem problems associated with the growing pains ofoperating new equipment on a new space platform. The PIMS project has analyzed thousands of hours of SAMS and MAMS data from the ISS. Analyseshave included the following activities and conditions:space shuttle dockings to the ISS; Progress dockings to the ISS; ISS systems and subsystems operations; scienceexperiment operations; crew exercise, nominal operations,and sleep periods; ISS vehicle attitudes and methods ofcontrol; and extravehicular activity for ISS assembly andmaintenance. Tasks for the project team supporting these instruments for the first year and a half of operationshave included monitoring flight and ground systems,maintaining continuous contact with JSC and MarshallSpace Flight Center employees by using pagers, main-taining console operations on an as-needed basis, archiv-ing instrument health and status data, and supportingincrement transitions. In June 2002, space shuttle mission STS-111 delivered two sensor head electronic enclosures to theISS. They were installed in the MSG and EXPRESSRack 3, facilities that support investigations in a varietyof disciplines on the ISS. A new SAMS vibratory sensor head to simplify the installation and operation in users' equipment wasdesigned in FY 2002. The new sensor head will becomethe primary sensor for vibratory acceleration measure-ment, with the same or better performance capabilities,but in a smaller package. In an effort to further reduceresources for acceleration measurement systems, a TSH-MEMS concept was developed during FYs 2001 and2002. This head will provide acceleration measurementfrom 1 to 400 Hz and will complement the TSH-ES. The acceleration measurement program analyzes the actual microgravity environment during space mis-sions, but it also helps to predict what that environmentwill be. In 2001, the Engineering Design and AnalysisDivision at Glenn Research Center (GRC) in Cleveland,Ohio, acquired the function of producing predictiveanalyses of the ISS microgravity environment. Thiseffort contributes to ensuring that the ISS and its pay-loads will be creating a world-class microgravity acceler-ation environment for the science experiments conductedonboard. Support and assistance to PIs is also offeredthrough experiment modeling and the division's experi-ence in how science experiments can impact and beimpacted by the microgravity environment. Before experiments and equipment are installed on the ISS, their effect on the environment can be tested.GRC's Microgravity Emissions Laboratory (MEL) is aone-of-a-kind laboratory that simulates and verifiesacceleration emissions generated by ISS payloads andtheir components, including disk drives, pumps, motors,solenoids, fans, and cameras. MEL uses a low-frequency acceleration measure- ment system for the characterization of rigid body iner-tial forces generated by various operating components ofthe ISS. Twenty-six tests in MEL between May 2000 andDecember 2002 have included ISS subsystem compo-nents, payload rack subsystem components, payloadcomponents, and entire payloads. The weight capacity ofthe facility has been increased to accommodate tests ofequipment at an ISS rack-level weight. The Physics ofColloids in Space (PCS) experiment hardware was testedin MEL May 4-10, 2000. The Zeolite Crystal Growth(ZCG) flight hardware was tested January 23-26, 2001,and backup flight hardware was tested April 15-19,2001. The wire rope isolators with the air thermal controlunit fans and housing assembly of the Fluids andCombustion Facility were tested in MEL on November1, 2001. The Lord isolators for the Light MicroscopyModule were also tested in MEL June 2-14, 2002. The PCS and ZCG experiments were tested in the emissions laboratory to define on-orbit vibratorydisturbance predictions. The PCS and ZCG tests weresuccessful, and payload integrators were provided withthe necessary information to determine their compliance to ISS requirements. The MEL test data of the PCSexperiment apparatus has been validated against flightmeasurements of SAMS data from ISS operations. The Fluids and Combustion Facility and Light Microscopy Module projects have both used the MELlaboratory to demonstrate the effectiveness of vibrationisolators for their projects. MEL was utilized to definethe most effective isolator treatments during the designphase of the engineering level hardware. Flight designchanges were implemented due to the initial MEL char-acterization of the vibration response expected fromcomponent hardware. Both of these projects have also utilized the MEL component data to predict flightrack-level vibratory disturbances. On January 5-16, 2001, MEL contributed to NASA's goals for future space exploration by providingtransmissibility characterization of two opposing StirlingTechnology Company's 55-Watt TechnologyDemonstration Converters that are to be installed into apower system for onboard electric power for NASA deepspace missions. The MEL testing was a part of a success-ful technology advancement of the development of thesepower converters. ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 70ACCELERATION MEASUREMENT8 It is important for ISS crewmembers to exercise to maintain their health in a microgravity environment. Crewmembers also participate in bio-medical research experiments by jogging on treadmills and undertakingother exercise-related activities. The acceleration measurement pro-gram records and analyzes the small vibrations caused by such neces-sary activities and makes the data available to researchers.credit: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002Highlights Minimizing Shake, Rattle, and Roll Most of the experiments aboard the ISS are there to take advantage of the microgravity environmentafforded by low Earth orbit. But even the smallestmotions, such as the subtle vibrations created by move-ment of the crew or hardware (such as the robotic arm),can affect those experiments by changing the micro-gravity environment aboard the ISS. The Active RackIsolation System (ARIS) is designed to mitigate the effectsof such vibrations by absorbing the shock of motion andthereby protecting experiments from that motion. Currently operating on the ISS, the ARIS system is connected to Rack 2 of the EXPRESS program, afacility that is accommodating early ISS investigations ina variety of disciplines. The ability of ARIS to isolate theexperiments in EXPRESS Rack 2 from minor disturbancesand vibrations is being analyzed in an experiment of itsown called the ARIS ISS Characterization Experiment(ICE). ARIS operates by using sensors that detect dis- turbances on the ISS. When a disturbance is detected, theARIS actuators deliver a reactive force to the rack tocounter the effects detected by the sensors. In effect,ARIS acts as a shock absorber for EXPRESS Rack 2. ARIS, however, is much more complex than the shock absorbers that you might find on your car. ARIS compo-nents include accelerometer assemblies that measure dis-turbances and send that information to the electronicunit, \"push rods\" that apply force against the ISS frame-work, and a microgravity rack barrier that prevents acci-dental crew disturbances of the ARIS rack. During ICE,the on-orbit vibration-reduction capabilities of the ARISsystem will be examined. ICE in part involves the use ofa shaker unit that has been installed in EXPRESS Rack 2.The shaker unit provides a precise, measurable distur-bance that will allow ground controllers to evaluate theefficacy of ARIS. NASA expects ARIS to play a key role in the successful completion of a number of biological, chemi-cal, and physical science experiments that depend on amicrogravity environment for obtaining useful data.Through its ability to help maintain a disturbance-freemicrogravity environment aboard the ISS, ARIS willcontribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge onEarth and to the success of the ISS as a space-based sci-entific laboratory. T eam Develops Award-W inning Softwar e Innovative software developed by the Principal Investigator Microgravity Services (PIMS) team receiveda Space Act Award and was a first runner-up for theSoftware of the Year Award in 2002. The new Microgravity Analysis Software System collects, archives, and processes acceleration data on acontinuous, untended basis and broadcasts uninterruptedanalyses of the microgravity environment on the Internetso that PIs in the ISS program and other interested par-ties have real-time access to data. The group has devel-oped new techniques appropriate for analyzing the vastamount of microgravity acceleration environment databeing acquired from the complex ISS vehicle and itsvariety of operational modes. The PIMS team provides critical support to PIs and other Physical Sciences Research Division partici-pants in spaceflight missions, such as vibration isolationprograms. To do this, PIMS must provide accelerationanalyses both in real time during missions and afterspaceflight, as well as respond to requests to analyze spe-cific aspects of the microgravity environment fromarchived data. In addition to real-time analyses, PIMSpublishes Increment Reports describing the ISS micro-gravity environment for periods of several months at atime and prepares custom reports or data sets specificallyrequested by individual researchers. 8ACCELERATION MEASUREMEN This shaker device was used to create known distubances in EXPRESS Rack 2 to test the Active Rack IsolationSystem (ARIS).credit: NASA ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 72he International Space Station (ISS) pro- vides researchers with a permanent orbiting laboratory inspace where one of the fundamental forces of nature \u2014gravity \u2014 is greatly reduced. Conducting research in thisfacility will enable world-class scientists from a varietyof discrete fields, as well as across a wide range of mul-tidisciplinary pursuits, to obtain research results that areimpossible to reproduce in any other venue. The benefitsof a permanent human presence in space aboard thespace station are expected to be infinite in scope,enhancing our understanding of fundamental scientificprocesses and bringing exciting new applications to ben-efit humans both on Earth and in their exploration ofspace. The physical sciences division will contribute enormously to these discoveries through the develop-ment of science experiments that can benefit from theunique environment the ISS provides and through theapplication of knowledge gained about the microgravityenvironment to exploration initiatives planned by NASA.To that end, the Physical Sciences Research Division has designed several multiuser experiment facilities specifi-cally for long-duration scientific research aboard the ISS.To obtain an optimal balance between science capabili-ties, costs, and risks, facility requirements definitionshave been aligned with evolving space station capabili-ties. These facilities are the Biotechnology Facility(BTF); the EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments toSpace Station (EXPRESS) Racks; the Fluids andCombustion Facility (FCF); Science Glovebox Their descrip-tions appear below.

The facility is intended to serve biotechnologists fromacademic, governmental, and industrial venues in thepursuit of basic and applied research. Changing sciencepriorities and advances in technology are easilyaccommodated by the BTF's modular design, allowingexperiments in cell culture, tissue engineering, andfundamental biotechnology to be supported by thisfacility. The BTF brings space science forward from the era of the space shuttle payload to the new age of thelong-term space laboratory and will elevate spaceresearch productivity to a level that is consistent with theproductivity of ground-based laboratories. The BTF willbe operated continuously on the ISS. It is a single-rackfacility with several separate experiment modules thatcan be integrated and exchanged with each space shuttleflight to the ISS. The facility provides each experimentmodule with power, gases, thermal cooling, computation-al capability for payload operation and data archiving,and video signal handling capabilities. Able to process3,000 to 5,000 specimens a year, the BTF will providesufficient experimental data to meet demands for objec-tive analysis and publication of results in relevant jour-nals. Careful design of experiments can result in thepublication of two to five primary articles per year.Validation of BTF concepts and operations were success-fully completed onboard the Russian space station, Mir, using the Biotechnology System (BTS). The BTS servedas an important risk-mitigation effort for the BTF,demonstrating the technology and systems that will sup-port biotechnology investigations for long-durationoperations. In fiscal year (FY) 2002, the BTF project team initiated the requirements definition phase, whichinvolves defining the engineering aspects of operatingthe facility in space. A system requirements review(SRR) was held in July 2002, and the science require-ments and system specifications were baselined later inthe year. Currently, preparations for the facility's prelimi-nary design review (PDR) are under way. The scheduledlaunch date for the first phase of the BTF facility is late2006. Biotechnology research during the early phases of the ISS will be conducted using a modular accom-modations rack system known as the EXPRESS Rack.The EXPRESS Rack requires individual experimentsto develop additional capabilities and involves scienceimplementation trade-offs. The EXPRESS Rack willhold currently existing biotechnology equipment previously flown on the space shuttle and on Mir. It will also accommodate the first operation of equipment built specifically to meet space stationrequirements. EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Racks The EXPRESS Rack is the standardized payload rack system that transports, stores, and supports ISSexperiments. The EXPRESS Rack is housed in anInternational Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) \u2014 a refrig-erator-sized container that provides the shell for theEXPRESS Rack \u2014 and supplies standard interfacesbetween the space station and the payload. EXPRESSRack payloads can be operated from the payload frontpanel, from the EXPRESS Rack front control panels, bythe ISS crew, or from the ground. The EXPRESS Rack includes both elements that remain on the ISS and elements that travel to and fromthe ISS. While the racks remain on the ISS, experimentsmay be changed out as needed. Payloads may use theentire rack or a portion of the rack. If more than one pay-load is included in one rack, the payloads can be operat-ed individually. By providing a design into whichresearch modules can be integrated, the rack helps toreduce the cost in money, time, and complexity of devel-oping payloads, thereby making the microgravityenvironment of low Earth orbit more accessible toresearchers from academia, government, and industry.When construction on the ISS is completed, a total of sixEXPRESS Racks will be included on board. The EXPRESS Racks support payloads from a variety of research disciplines, including biology,physics, chemistry, ecology, and medicine. Various mod-ules that have been designed for use in the EXPRESSRacks are described in the following paragraphs. The Apparatus for the Study of Material Growth and Liquids Behavior Near Their Critical Point(DECLIC) facility is being developed by the Frenchspace agency (CNES) in cooperation with GlennResearch Center (GRC) in Cleveland, Ohio, to provide acompact autonomous or tele-operated capability for flu-ids research. The facility consists of two middeck lockersthat will fit into an EXPRESS Rack. It will supportresearch on fluids near the critical point and transparentmaterials systems during solidification, as well as otherfluids experiments that are compatible with availableimaging, interferometric, and light scattering diagnostics.Through cooperative interagency agreements signed inearly 2000, NASA will provide launch, integration, andresources for DECLIC and will share in the utilization ofthe facility. An experiment-specific insert is being developed for the DECLIC facility to support research related totesting the theories that describe nontraditional forces atthe diffusive interface in flow regimes. The insert isexpected to be operational in 2006.ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 74INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION9 Fluids and Combustion Facility (FCF) The Fluids and Combustion Facility is a modu- lar, multiuser facility that will be located in Destiny, theU.S. laboratory module of the ISS, and will accommo-date sustained, systematic microgravity experimentationin both the fluid physics and combustion science disci-plines. The FCF flight unit consists of two poweredracks called the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) andthe Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR). The CIR, to bedeployed to the ISS in FY 2004, and the FIR, to bedeployed to the ISS in FY 2005, will be linked by fiberoptic cable to provide direct communication between thetwo racks, resulting in a fully integrated FCF system.The two racks will operate together with payload experi-ment equipment, ground-based operations facilities, andthe FCF ground unit. The facility will also supportexperiments from science disciplines other than fluidsand combustion and commercial and internationalinvestigations. The FCF is being developed at GRC. A contract called the Microgravity Research Development andOperations Contract was initiated by GRC in FY 2000for primary development of the FCF by NorthrupGrumman, who will also develop, integrate, and supportthe operation of the initial FCF combustion science andfluid physics payloads. The FCF preliminary designreview was successfully accomplished in FY 2001,which led to the completion of engineering modeldesigns. In FY 2002, the FCF successfully finished the assembly and checkout of the CIR and FIR engi-neering model units. Results of environmental and per-formance testing of the CIR and FIR engineeringmodel units are being used to finalize the flight designin preparations for the FCF critical design review inearly FY 2003. The Granular Flow Module (GFM) is a mini- facility initially designed to conduct three microgravitygranular experiments in the FIR on the ISS. Granularmaterials, such as dry sand, soil, and powders, exhibitflow characteristics that are similar to those of liquids insome ways, but quite different in other ways. The micro-gravity environment provides data on granular materialsthat cannot be collected on Earth, where gravity collaps-es the materials so quickly that scientists cannot takemeasurements of their movement. Studying the flow ofgranular materials will further the understanding ofdesign models for soil movement under confinement andvarious stresses, including shear stress, which is theforce that causes two objects (e.g., grains of sand) toslide relative to each other in a direction parallel to theirplane of contact. These models can be applied tostrengthening building foundations, managing undevel-oped land, and handling powdered and granular materialsin chemical, agricultural, and other industries.The GFM will provide three experiment shear apparatuses; a multispeed low/high-frame-rate camera;the ability to supply and remove the spheres used tomodel granular flow; and systems to control the rotationof the boundaries, stress measurement, and nitrogenflow. The GFM will allow for on-orbit operations through imbedded software. The software will control theexperiment operations, data collection, and data transferto the ground. The module will also allow for groundcontrol. The GFM will permit on-orbit reconfigurationand maintenance that can support follow-on experiments.The ISS and the FIR will provide many significant func-tions and resources to the GFM. The ISS will provide thespace platform and communication to ground for theFIR. The FIR supplies an environmentally controlledspace, an optic bench, power, cooling fluid and gas, vac-uum exhaust, avionics, image processing, data storage,and additional science diagnostic hardware. The facilityis designed to minimize vibration transmission to theexperiment shear apparatus, the FIR, and the ISS, as well as to minimize crew time, power requirements,and mass. The Light Microscopy Module (LMM) will be the first integrated payload into the FIR aboard the ISS.The development of the LMM, an automated, remotelycontrollable microscope for experiments in complex flu-ids, has made tremendous progress toward the criticaldesign of the spaceflight hardware. The LMM is plannedas a subrack facility, allowing flexible scheduling andoperation of fluids and biotechnology experiments. The LMM flight unit features a modified com- mercial off-the-shelf Leica RXA microscope, which isenhanced to operate automatically with some interactionfrom the ground support staff or the astronaut crew. Aresearcher can choose from six objective lenses of differ-ent magnifications and numerical aperture to obtain therequired science data. In addition to video microscopytechniques used to record sample features, includingbasic structures and crystal growth dynamics, the micro-scope is modified and enhanced to provide the followingadditional capabilities: interferometry to measure vaporbubble thin-film thickness, par-ticle manipulation and confocal microscopyto provide three-dimensional visualization of samplestructures, and spectrophotometry to measure photonicproperties. This suite of measurements allows a verybroad characterization of fluids, colloids, and two-phasemedia, including biological samples. The LMM will usecameras and light sources provided by the FIR to accom-plish these imaging techniques. The LMM will receive power, communications, air and water cooling, vacuum exhaust, avionics, imageANNUAL REPORT 2001-20029INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATIO processing, data storage, and additional science diagnostic hardware from the FIR rack. The LMM will be installedwhile the ISS is in orbit, and will remain in the FIR for aperiod of 30 months performing five separate fluidphysics experiments. Low-Temperature Microgravity Physics Facility (LTMPF) The Low-Temperature Microgravity Physics Facility is a complete cryogenic laboratory that will beattached to the Japanese Experiment Module-ExposedFacility (JEM-EF) on the ISS. The LTMPF consists oftwo identical dewars, each of which can support twoexperiments in parallel operations. The facility isdesigned for studies of low-temperature (as low as 1.6kelvins) and condensed matter physics. The LTMPF project made significant progress in finalizing the critical design of the facility subsystemsfor its first mission (M1). In preparation for a systemcritical design review previously scheduled forNovember 2002, the project successfully held a series ofthorough and in-depth technical peer reviews for all sub-systems and M1 instruments during September andOctober 2002. The peer reviews validated critical designsin all key areas and examined the plans and readiness forflight fabrication, integration, and test. Schedule-criticalhardware development is well under way, with substan-tial progress made in the areas of flight dewar fabrica-tion, dewar welding, flight computer and key electronicsboards, M1 flight instrument sensor packages, and com-mon flight hardware such as superconducting quantuminterference device sensors. A two-year delay of the JEM-EF launch and budget reductions had a significant adverse impact on theLTMPF's development. Critical flight design and devel-opment were scaled back, and the project went through amajor replanning process at the end of calendar year2002. As a result, the LTMPF will not be available foruse by researchers until July 2007. Other major mile-stones for the M1 mission are delayed accordingly, withthe system's critical design review now scheduled inSeptember 2003. Additional options for attaching theLTMPF to the ISS are also being considered. Materials Science Research Rack-1 (MSRR-1) The MSRR-1 is being developed to provide a flexible, permanent platform in the U.S. Laboratory mod-ule dedicated to investigations in materials science. Thisfacility will support research on a range of materials,including metals and alloys, glasses, electronic materials,ceramics, polymers, and other special purpose materials.The MSRR-1 will be composed of experiment modulesand module inserts that can be delivered to the ISS bythe space shuttle, then integrated andexchanged by crewmembers aboard thestation. its theneed developingand support near-termand long-rangeapproaches for per-forming science investigations in themicrogravity environment on the ISS. The MSRR-1 successfully passed the phase 2 flight safety review conducted by Johnson SpaceCenter's (JSC's) Payload Safety Review Panel inSeptember 2001. This significant milestone clears theway for construction of ground and flight hardware toproceed. MSRR-1 also completed the integrated payloadcritical design review in June 2002 and the MarshallSpace Flight Center's (MSFC's) Systems ManagementOffice independent annual review in June 2002. TheMSRR-1 is currently scheduled for launch in July 2005. The first experiment module planned for use in the MSRR-1 is the Materials Science Laboratory (MSL),which is being developed by the European Space Agency(ESA). Occupying approximately one-half of the rack,the MSL module will be launched and integrated into theMSRR-1 unit in August 2003. The MSL will accommo-date materials processing inserts that contain experiment-specific hardware. NASA is building a furnace for the MSL called the Quench Module Insert (QMI). The QMI is a high-temperature, Bridgman-type furnace with an actively With its standardized hardware interfaces streamlined approach, the EXPRESS Raenables quick, simple integration of multpayloads aboard the International SpaceStation.credit: NANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 76INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION9 cooled cold zone. It is being designed to create an extremely high-temperature gradient for the directionalsolidification processing of metals and alloys. Dir-ectional solidification is a process by which a long, thinsample is melted, then slowly solidified, starting at oneend of the ampoule and proceeding to the other. This tech-nique is useful for studying the solidification behavior ofmaterials and for the growth of high-quality single crystals. The QMI also has a feature known as \"quench capability.\" This allows the furnace to rapidly freeze thesample at the liquid-solid interface, where most of theinteresting science takes place during directionalsolidification. Quenching preserves this liquid-solidinterface, allowing scientists to examine it carefully when the samples are returned to Earth, whereresearchers can develop models that recreate and explainexactly what was happening during solidification. TheQMI successfully completed its phase 2 flight safetyreview by the JSC's Payload Safety Review Panel inAugust 2001. In addition to NASA's QMI, two module inserts are being developed by ESA for the MSL, the LowGradient Furnace (LGF) and the Solidification andQuenching Furnace (SQF). Both furnaces can accommo-date processing temperatures up to 1600\u00b0C. The LGF isprimarily intended for crystal growth experiments requir-ing directional solidification processing in which precisetemperature requirements and control of translationspeed are needed. The SQF will be used for metallurgicalexperiments requiring large thermal gradients and rapidquenching of samples. Additional module inserts can bedeveloped and processed over the lifetime of the MSLand the MSRR-1. The second experiment module, completing the initial MSRR-1 configuration, is a commercial researchfacility: the Space Product Development furnace. Thiscommercial furnace will be replaced in orbit with otherNASA materials science modules after approximatelyone year. Microgravity Science The MSG facility enables scientists from mul- tiple disciplines to participate actively in the assemblyand operation of experiments in space with much thesame degree of involvement they have in their ownresearch laboratories. Developed by ESA and integrat-ed by MSFC, the MSG was launched to the ISS inJune 2002. This facility offers an enclosed work areathat is accessible to the crew through sealed gloveports and to ground-based scientists through real-timedata links and video. Because the MSG work area canbe sealed and held at a negative pressure, the crew canmanipulate experiment hardware and samples without the potential hazard of small parts, particulates, fluids, and gases escaping into the open laboratory module. For conducting investigations, each experiment apparatus is mounted to the floor of the MSG workingarea (approximately 90 cm x 50 cm) and connected onthe back wall to standard utilities such as power, comput-er communications, and control units. The work area unitis designed to slide forward on rails that can extend outof the volume of the rack. This forms an enclosed \"table-top\" for experiment containment and operation. A notable feature of the MSG system is its sub- stantial video, data acquisition, and command and control During Expedition 5, Peggy Whitson completes the installation of the Microgravity Science Glovebox in the Destiny module and prepares it for the first series of experiments.credit: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-20029INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATIO capabilities. Up to four color cameras are avail- able for viewing and recording experimentprocesses. Flat-screen monitors can displayviews of any two of these cameras and simulta-neously share the views with the investigator onthe ground. The entire system is controllablethrough computer interfaces either with theonboard MSG computer or via the ISS data sys-tem from the ground. These resources allowresearchers to adjust experiment processes as theyoccur, based on the results of their observations. To facilitate the use of the MSG by the scientific community, MSFC maintains anactive group of managers, engineers, and sup-port personnel to assist investigators with thecomplex task building and operating an experi-ment in space. Construction of the MSG wascompleted by ESA in 2001, and the facility wassubsequently launched and integrated into theISS. Prior to the end of FY 2002, the unit hadbeen successfully used to conduct a series ofmaterials science experiments in two differentinvestigations, Solidification Using a Baffle in aSealed Ampoule and the Pore Formation andMobility Investigation. In both cases, the team-work concept inherent in the MSG designdemonstrated that enhanced scientific return ispossible when the crew and scientists can easilyinteract. For future MSG experiments that are particularly sensitive to low-level vibrations, anew device, the Glovebox IntegratedMicrogravity Isolation Technology (g-LIMIT)apparatus, is undergoing final phases of devel-opment and testing. After the g-LIMIT unit hasbeen delivered to the ISS and has completedon-orbit characterization and testing, vibration-sensitive experiments will be mounted to anelectromagnetically levitated top plate of theg-LIMIT unit. Specially designed umbilicalswill connect experiments to the MSG utilities.Additional experiments, sponsored by bothNASA and ESA, are planned for FY 2003.These new experiments will extend the use ofthe MSG unit to additional disciplines, includingbiotechnology, combustion, and fluid science. Schedule of Flights Approximately 25 flight opportunities have been planned to date for the delivery of the U.S. Laboratorymodule of the ISS and its components (including themicrogravity facilities described above), the utilization ofthe space station for microgravity experiments, and thedelivery of modules and racks developed by NASA andits international partners.

These facilities includedKC-135 parabolic flight aircraft, the 2.2 Second DropTower, and the Zero Gravity Research Facility. Thereduced-gravity facilities at Glenn Research Center(GRC) and Johnson Space Center (JSC) have supportednumerous investigations addressing a variety of process-es and phenomena in several research disciplines.Microgravity, a state of apparent weightlessness, can becreated in these facilities by executing a freefall or semi-freefall condition, where the force of gravity on an objectis offset by its linear acceleration during a \"fall\" (a dropin a tower or a parabolic maneuver by an aircraft). Even though ground-based facilities offer rela- tively short experiment times of less than 25 seconds,this available test time has been found to be sufficient toadvance the scientific understanding of many phenome-na. Experiments scheduled to fly on the space shuttle andthe International Space Station are frequently tested andvalidated in the ground facilities prior to being conduct-ed in space. Experimental studies in a low-gravity envi-ronment can enable new discoveries and advance thefundamental understanding of science. Many tests per-formed in NASA's ground-based microgravity facilities,particularly in the disciplines of combustion science andfluid physics, have resulted in exciting findings that aredocumented in a large body of literature.

InFY 2002, 59 experiments were performed during 1,871trajectories over 108 flight hours. Of these 59 experi-ments, 24 were in combustion, 30 were in fluid physics,3 were in materials science, 1 was in fundamentalphysics, and 1 was in exploration research. The GRC 2.2 Second Drop Tower offers a short- er test time than the KC-135, but its simple mode ofoperation and normal throughput capacity of 12 tests perday make it an attractive and highly utilized test facility,particularly for performing evaluation and feasibilitytests. The drop tower is able to provide gravitational lev-els that range from 1 percent of Earth's gravitationalacceleration to 0.01 percent. More than 23,000 tests have been performed in the drop tower to date. In FY 2002,the number of drop tests conducted averaged more than80 per month. Reduced-gravity conditions in the drop tower are created by dropping an experiment contained within anenclosure known as a drag shield, which isolates the testhardware from aerodynamic drag during a 24-meterfreefall in an open environment. Twenty-five experi-ments were supported during 1,241 drops performed inFY 2001, and 29 experiments were supported during the1,024 drops performed in FY 2002. As in the past, sever-al of these experiments were aiding the development ofresearch that will be conducted in space. The steady uti- lization of the drop tower is expected tocontinue, as many new experiments arein the design and fabrication phases ofdevelopment for the coming years. The Zero Gravity Research Facility at GRC, a registered U.S.national landmark, provides a quiescentlow-gravity environment for a test dura-tion of 5.18 seconds as experiments aredropped in a vacuum chamber that goes132 meters (432 feet) underground.Aerodynamic drag on the freely fallingexperiment is nearly eliminated by drop-ping in a vacuum. This procedurerestricts drop tests to two per day, result-ing in fewer projects supported in thisfacility than in the 2.2 Second DropTower. However, the relatively long testtime and excellent low-gravity condi-tions more than compensate for thelower test throughput rate. In FY 2001, 8major projects were supported as 174test drops were executed. In FY 2002,10 major projects were supported with148 test drops being completed.Table 9 \u2014 Use of Ground-Based Low-Gravity Facilities in FY 2001/2002 KC-1352.2 Second aboard NASA's KC-135 turbojet transport, which flies parabolic arcs to produce 20 to 25-second periods of microgravity.

Major national educator conferences give NASA the opportunity to demonstrate new ways to teach stu-dents about the importance of microgravity research.More than 75,000 elementary and secondary school(K-12) teachers and administrators attended annualmeetings of the National Science Teachers Association,the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, theInternational Technology Education Association, theNational Association of Biology Teachers, and theAmerican Association of Physics Teachers, all of whichfeatured booths staffed by PSR Division personnel.Microgravity science and mathematics posters, teacher'sguides, mathematics briefs, microgravity demonstratormanuals, microgravity technology guides, microgravitymission and science lithographs, and WWW micro-gravity resources sheets were distributed to teachers at these conferences. The National Center for Microgravity Research K-12 Outreach Program had 12 new educational prod-ucts in process during FY 2001-2002, including threeeducator guides. Two of the guides, How High Is It? and Amusement Park Physics With a NASA Twist , are for middle school teachers and were evaluated in pilot pro-grams. The finalized publications will become availablein the spring of 2003. The third educator guide, Science in a Box: NASA Glovebox Activities in Science,Mathematics, and Technology , is for high school teach- ers. This guide contains schematics for fabricating awooden glovebox with camera, lighting, fan, and powersystems. The students can then conduct experimentactivities based on either actual glovebox flight investi-gations or microgravity research in biology, physics,and chemistry. The PSR Division, along with the Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR) and its otherresearch divisions, initiated a formal collaborative effortwith the National Association of Biology Teachers(NABT) in FY 2001. The PSR Cell Sciences Program atJohnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and the Physical Sciences Outreach and Education Program atMarshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama,developed a bioreactor education guide targeting highschool biology classes. The curriculum supplement,which demonstrates the unique cell and tissue cultureresearch possible using NASA's rotating wall vesselbioreactor, was featured in an NABT workshop. WayneCarley, executive director of the NABT, commented,\"We see NASA research as an incredibly engaging wayto bring people into the world of science.\" Carley findsthe cutting-edge fundamental biology research conductedby NASA especially valuable to NABT members: \"Wehave members who teach subjects such as neurobiologyand human performance who could use direct examplesof space research in these areas in their lesson plans.\" The Student Access to Space Program, founded by Alexander McPherson of the University of California,Irvine, teaches students how to perform crystallizationexperiments in the classroom and on the International West Virginia students worked with NASA and university scientists to load biological samples for an International Space Station experi-ment as part of the Student Access to Space program. Once deliv-ered to the space station, the samples thawed and formed crystalsto be returned to Earth for further study. The space experiment andthe educational workshops were sponsored by NASA's MarshallSpace Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and the University ofCalifornia, Irvine. credit: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002 82OUTREACH AND EDUCATION11 Space Station (ISS). The program uses the Enhanced Gaseous Nitrogen (EGN) Dewar project, an inexpensive,simple, high-capacity system for the crystallization ofdifferent samples in space aboard the ISS. Teachersattend workshops where they learn about a classroomversion of the experiment and curriculum activities onstructural biology. Students also compete to participate inthe Protein Crystals in Space Program, where they attenda Student Flight Sample Workshop. They prepare andload actual flight samples into the EGN-Dewar facility,are present at launch, and receive their samples backafter flight. This program seeks to reach underservedinner-city and rural schools, special needs and gifted stu-dents, and mainstream schools. Approximately 58,000students and almost 1,200 teachers have been involved inthis program so far. Of those, more than 420 students and260 teachers have been involved in the Student FlightSample Workshops. Microgravity News , the quarterly newsletter reporting on microgravityresearch in the physical sciences, wasredesigned and expanded in FY 2001to cover activities in all four researchdivisions of the OBPR enterprise.Now called Space Research , the newsletter continues to reach thou-sands of K-12 teachers, curriculumsupervisors, science writers, universi-ty faculty, graduate students, scien-tists, principal investigators, and tech-nology developers, among others.Each issue of Space Research includes a feature on a topic impor-tant to the entire enterprise, researchupdates for each division, spotlightsabout special events or awards, meet-ings, research announcements andselections, and a profile of a memberof OBPR's research community. Atthe end of FY 2002, the distributionfor each issue totaled about 20,000copies, almost double that ofMicrogravity News . Space Research has a subscriber base of 8,000 and ismailed to 38 countries. A significantrise has been seen in the number ofindividuals requesting to be added tothe mailing list. Both Space Research and archived issues of Microgravity News are available on the WWW at http://spaceresearch.nasa.gov/general_info/prespublic.html#newsletters . A key element of outreach is the effective use of images. Images are acritical element in telling a com- pelling and interesting science story, and the PSRDivision outreach team continues to improve its reposi-tory of still images for this purpose. The microgravityportion of the web-based image archive athttp://mix.msfc.nasa.gov grows by approximately 250 new physical sciences images each year and was chosenas the basis for an enterprise-wide image archive for theOBPR in FY 2003. Video is also an important means ofcommunicating about microgravity research. In FY 2002,a lending video library was established by JohnsonSpace Center's Biological Systems Office Outreachand Education department that is available to scientistsand outreach staff to support events such as exhibitsand lectures. The library is made up of more than 100items available in VHS, 8 mm, Mini DV , or CD/DVDformat. Topics covered include general program infor-mation, flight and ground experiments, and hardwaretests. Microgravity News , a quarterly newsletter that covered physical sciences research, was redesigned and renamed Space Research . The newsletter now covers all four research divisions of the Office of Biological and PhysicalResearch. ANNUAL REPORT 2001-200211OUTREACH AND EDUCATIO Sites on the Internet sponsored by the physical sciences research program continue to serve as clearing-houses of information for the science community, thepublic, and educators. Hundreds of thousands of Internetusers visit these program-sponsored sites each year. ThePSR Division's primary web site at http://spaceresearch. nasa.gov/research_projects/microgravity.html provides detailed information about microgravity research andhighlights of current events and milestones as well aslinks to other important sites under the physical sciencesumbrella. The Microgravity Research Program Office's(MRPO's) web page at http://microgravity.nasa.gov provides links to news highlights, information aboutupcoming conferences, and microgravity-relatedresearch announcements, as well as enhanced links tomicrogravity research centers and projects, educational links, and links to the microgravity image archive. A listof microgravity-related web sites sponsored by the pro-gram is presented on page 87. The Internet also continues to be an important distribution method for microgravity outreach and educa-tion products. Efforts were ongoing in FYs 2001 and2002 to make educators aware of all the microgravityresearch education products that are available onlinethrough the MRPO web site, NASA Spacelink, and theNASA CORE (Central Operation of Resources forEducators) education distribution system.

Highlights Make the Connection The \"NASA-Iowa Connection: International Space Station Project\" is bringing rich learning opportu-nities to I owa teachers and students through Iowa's fiber optic and broadcast system known as the IowaCommunications Network (ICN). Marshall Space FlightCenter's Education Programs Department andMicrogravity Research Program Office are participatingin this pilot distance-learning project for the educationalcommunities of Iowa. Twila Schneider, an InfinityTechnology Inc. employee based in Huntsville, Alabama,supporting the Microgravity Research Program Office,conducted a workshop on February 27, 2002, for Iowateachers. She presented an introduction to the basic con- cepts of microgravity and research conducted in theMicrogravity Science Glovebox. The teachers receivedbackground information regarding ISS physical sciencesresearch and were provided a guide for making their ownclassroom glovebox using a standard copier paper box. Middle school students involved in this distance- learning project designed and constructed models of afuture space station from everyday household materials.Students also learned about the ISS and other space-related topics, including space food. Several \"Ask theExpert\" sessions were conducted for the students. Oneincluded scientists from the NASA Food TechnologyCommercial Space Center at Iowa State University (ISU)in Ames, who explained about how space food was man-ufactured, packaged, and prepared in space. Astronautand ISU alumnus Clayton Anderson also participated inthis session. If this pilot project is successful, it could beconducted in other states with statewide distance-learn-ing networks similar to the ICN. Question and Answer Sessions About Space The Physical Sciences Research Division was heavily involved in the Second Pan-Pacific BasinWorkshop on Microgravity Science held in Pasadena,California, May 1-4, 2001. Almost 200 scientists repre-senting 82 universities and 12 countries gathered to sharetheir latest research related to microgravity and the spaceenvironment. They also learned firsthand how outreachand education can play a key role in explaining the bene-fits of their work to large numbers of people. StevenSample, chairman of the Association of Pacific RimUniversities, one of the hosting organizations, said, \"Weall recognize the common basic need for increased edu-cation and knowledge about the effects of gravity andmicrogravity in countless areas of our lives.\" A few of the scientists shared their work with yet a broader audience during two satellite broadcast ses-sions held at the California Science Center in LosAngeles. More than 800 students and adults participatedin real-time discussions about a variety of topics, fromwhy scientists conduct research in microgravity to whyastronauts get \"Moon face\" when in orbit. Participantswere all beneficiaries of NASA's efforts to increaseawareness of careers in science and mathematics andidentify ways in which members of the public can beinvolved in NASA science programs. The first session was geared toward encouraging young people to go into careers in science or mathemat-ics. For this event, the science center hosted more than100 local high school students and three panelists (amaterials scientist, a biologist, and a physician who is aformer astronaut). Students at the location, as well as Astronaut Clayton Anderson, a graduate of Iowa State University 's aerospace engi- neering program, participated in two IowaCommunications Network sessions for theNASA-Iowa Connection program. A cooper-ative project between NASA and IowaPublic Television, this program teachesmiddle school students about science andtechnology in space. credit: NASAANNUAL REPORT 2001-200211OUTREACH AND EDUCATIO another 200 students at three other science centers across the country, saw presentations by the panelists and thenasked them questions about their research and space travel. The second session was geared toward building interest in microgravity research among the generalpublic. The session featured presentations on atomicclocks and combustion research along with firsthandaccounts of travel on a space shuttle. Viewers at twoother U.S. science centers and at Flinders University inAdelaide, Australia, could see the presentations in realtime and then ask questions of the panelists: a fundamen-tal physicist, a combustion scientist, and Chiaki Mukai, aJapanese physician who is currently an astronaut. Theinvestigators at the science center explained how theirmicrogravity research resulted in commercial productsfor use on the ground. As well, Mukai, who flew as apayload specialist on space shuttle flight STS-95,described the experience of being in space and how sheperformed science experiments during her flight.Participants at both sessions also viewed a short videofeaturing conversations with students and laypeople from countries around the pan-Pacific Basin about their per-spectives on space and space travel. These outreach and education sessions supported the purpose of the conference, which was to go beyondcultural differences to advance microgravity research andpromote the understanding of its importance. As Samplenoted, \"All these [cultural] differences can be and oftenare obstacles to communication and understanding, butit's important to remember that people on both sides ofthe Pacific share quite similar fundamental ideas andgoals: to build better societies. And these goals can't bereached without building better-educated societies andwithout the open sharing of knowledge.\" Dr op a DIME for Education The NASA Dropping in a Microgravity Environment (DIME) student competition pilot projectcame to a successful conclusion April 25-27, 2001, at Marshall Space Flight Center employees visited DuPont Manual High School in Louisville, Kentucky, as part of an outreach session of the Second Annual Pan-Pacific BasinWorkshop on Microgravity Science.

The competition involved high school-aged student teamswho developed concepts for microgravity experimentsand prepared experiment proposals. A team of NASAscientists and engineers evaluated the student team pro-posals and selected two teams. Mentored by NASA sci-entists, the two student teams \u2014 one from COSI Academy,sponsored by the Columbus, Ohio, Center of Science andIndustry (COSI), and the other from Sycamore HighSchool in Cincinnati, Ohio \u2014 designed microgravityexperiments, fabricated the experimental apparatus, andvisited GRC to operate their experiments in the 2.2Second Drop Tower. The COSI Academy team investigated the effects of density and phases of matter in a microgravity envi-ronment by observing the interaction of soybeans insmall bottles of ginger ale. The Sycamore High Schoolteam investigated the effects of microgravity on the com-bustion of cotton \u2014 an experiment developed after theteam discovered that NASA astronaut clothing is oftenmade of 100 percent cotton. While the pilot yearinvolved teams based in Ohio, for school year2001-2002, teams based in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan,Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin are eligible. In futureyears, teams from the 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C.,and Puerto Rico will be eligible.
