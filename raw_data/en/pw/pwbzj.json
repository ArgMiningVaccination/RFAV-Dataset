Furthermore, those participating in [holistic treatment](https://web.archive.org/web/20140129162908/http://www.treatmentsolutions.com:80/holistic-treatment-for-substance-abuse/) for substance abuse tend to improve their self-care routines, adopt healthy coping mechanisms, exercise more, make more nutritious meal choices, get more restful sleep, be more mindful, and overall feel more relaxed and at peace than before. As a result, they are less likely to relapse and more likely to pursue a healthy, fulfilling life. What is Holistic Detox? While traditional [detox programs](https://detoxwesttennessee.com/) primarily focus on the physical aspects of withdrawal, holistic detox takes a more inclusive approach. Instead, those in a holistic drug or alcohol detox find full-body healing through natural means and medication-free solutions. As a result, individuals encounter a more meaningful and long-lasting recovery than those who only participate in medical detox. Because holistic detox focuses on improving every facet of a person, individuals are able to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them. This is beneficial during detox as they are able to identify and address their external and internal triggers in a constructive, healthy way.
