This is a closed formulary and only those drugs listed in this formulary will be covered by MedStar Family Choice - District of Columbia for the Health Families Medicaid and Alliance enrollees. For MedStar Family Choice - District of Columbia members in Healthy Families may fill HIV and AIDS medications at any in-network retail pharmacy. For members in Alliance, medications for the treatment of HIV and AIDS are supplied through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP).

Prescriptions for PreP (HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis) may be filled at any in-network pharmacy for members of Healthy Families and Alliance. The drugs listed in the MedStar Family Choice - DC Healthy Families and DC Healthcare Alliance Prescribing Guide have been reviewed and approved by the MedStar Family C hoice Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The drugs have been selected to provide the most clinically appropriate and cost-effective medications for patients who have drug benefits administered through MedStar Family Choice - Distri ct of Columbia. There may be occasions when an unlisted drug is desired for medical management of a specific patient. In those instances, the unlisted medication may be requested through the Medical Exception process. The information contained in this formulary and its appendice s is provided solely for the convenience of medical providers. This formulary is subject to state-specific regulations and rules, incl uding, but not limited to, those regarding generic substitution, controlled substance schedules , preference for brands and mandatory generics whenever applicable.

This formulary is not intended to be a substitute for the knowledge, expertise, skill and judgment of the medical provider in his or her choice of prescription drugs. MedStar Family Choice does not assume responsibility for the actions or omissions of any medica l provider based upon reliance, in whole or in part, on the information contained herein.

MedStar Family Choice will provide free aids and services to people with disabilities to communicate effectively with us (this includes qualified sign language interpreters, written in formation in accessible formats, and free language services to those whose primary language is not English, including qua lified interpreters and information written in other languages). If you need these services, contact Member Services at 888-404-3549 . We have an internal grievance procedure to help quickly and fa irly resolve complaints alleging illegal discrimination under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18116) and its implementing regulations at 45 CFR part 92, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Servic es. This section of law prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in cert ain health programs and activities. This section of law can be reviewed in the Compliance Department of MedStar Family C hoice. MedStar Family Choice has a specific person who assists us in complying with issues that involve Section 1557: Section 1557 Coordinator 4000 Connecticut Ave., NW, Pod 3NWashington, DC 20008 888-404-3549 MFCDC1557Coordinator@medstar.net MedStar Family Choice - DC Healthy Fa milies and DC Healthcare Alliance Program 6 Any person who believes someone has been subjected to discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability may file a grievance under this procedure. It is against the law for MedStar Family Choice to retaliate against anyone who opposes discrimination, fi les a grievance, or participates in the investigation of a grievance. Procedure: Grievances must be sent to the Section 1557 Coordi nator within (60 days) of the date the person filing the grievance becomes aware of the alleged discriminatory action. A complaint must be in writing and include the name and address of the person filing it. The complaint must state the problem or action alleged to be discriminatory and the desired resolution. The Section 1557 Coordinator (or her/his designee) will investigate the complaint. This investigation may be informal, but it will be thorough. There is an opportuni ty to submit evidence regarding the complaint. MFC will maintain the records regarding these grievances . To the extent possible, and in accordance with applicable law, the Section 1557 Coordinator will keep t he files confidential and will only share with those who have a need to know. The Section 1557 Coordinator will send a writt en decision on the grievance, based on what we found during our investigation within 30 days of receiving t he complaint. The notice will include what to do if you do not agree with the decision, including but not limited to the ability to appeal to the President of MedStar Family Choice. The availability and use of this grievance procedure do not prevent a person from pursuing other legal or administrative remedies, including filing a complaint of discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in court or with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Servic es, Office for Civil Rights. A person can file a complaint of discrimination electronically through the Office for Civil Rights Complaint Portal, which is available at: https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/portal/lobby.jsf , or by mail or phone at: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence Avenue SW, Room 509F, HHH Building, Washington, DC 20201. 1-800-368-1019, 800-537-7697 (TDD) Complaint forms are available at: http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/file/index.html .

MedStar Family Choice - DC Healthy Fa milies and DC Healthcare Alliance Program 7 MedStar Family Choice - DC Healthy Fa milies and DC Healthcare Alliance Program 8 MedStar Family Choice - DC Healthy Fa milies and DC Healthcare Alliance Program 9 MedStar Family Choice - DC Healthy Fa milies and DC Healthcare Alliance Program 10 PREFACE The MedStar Family Choice - DC Healthy Families and DC Healthcare Alliance Prescribing Guide is organized by sections. Each section includes therapeutic groups identified by either a drug class or dis ease state. All drugs listed were selected to be on this formulary. Products are lis ted by generic name. Brand-name products are included as a reference to assist in product recognition. Unless excepti ons are noted, generally all dosage forms and strengths of the drug cited are covered. This formulary covers prescription and selected over-t he-counter (OTC) products. Y ou are encouraged to prescribe them when clinically appropriate. A pre scription (written or telephoned) is also required for OTC medications and refills are permitted. Prescription medications for chronic condition s should be written as a 30 or 90-day supply with refills. Prescription and OTC medications can be refilled for a maxi mum of 12 months. For covered OTC products refer to the Over-The-Counter (OTC) Drug Co verage section that is located near the end of the introductory sections of this formulary. Mail order service is also available for members of MFC-DC. PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS (P&T) COMMITTEE The MedStar Family Choice P&T Committee includes ph ysicians, pharmacists, and nurses. The Committee meets bimonthly to evaluate drugs for formulary inclusion and to develop policies concerning formulary and drug utilization management. Please visit the MedStar Family Choice website at www.medstarfamilychoice.com to view the decisions of the MedStar Family Choice P&T Committ ee and any applicable changes. The main features of the MedStar Family Choice P&T Policies are also on the website in the FAQs. PRODUCT SELECTION CRITERIA The MedStar Family Choice Pharmacy and Therapeutics Commi ttee considers clinical information on new-to-market drugs that are typically included in an outpatient pharmacy benef it. The evaluation includes all or part of the following: Safety Efficacy Comparison studies Approved indications Adverse effects Contraindications/Warnings/Precautions Pharmacokinetics Patient administration/compliance considerations When a new drug is considered for formulary inclusion, it will be reviewed relative to similar drugs currently on formulary. In addition, the entire MedStar Family Choice - DC Healthy Families and DC Healthcare Alliance Prescribing Guide is reviewed on an annual basis. All the information in the MedStar Family Choice - DC Healthy Families and DC Healthcare Alliance Prescribing Guide is provided as a reference for drug therapy selection. Specif ic drug selection for an individual patient rests solely with the prescriber. GENERIC AVAILABILITY Boldface type of a generic drug name in this book indicates generic availability of that product. However, not all strengths or dosage forms of the generic name in boldfac e type may be generically available. In some cases, the brand name listed is a generic drug . Examples of the latter include Ery-tab and Zovia. GENERIC SUBSTITUTION Generic substitution is a pharmacy acti on whereby a generic version is dispen sed rather than a prescribed brand-name product. An important consideration for generic substitution is the knowledge that all approvals of generic drugs by the FDA since 1984, and many generic approvals prior to 1984, have a showing of bioequivalence between the generic versions and the reference brand product. To gain FDA approval: 1. The generic drug must contain the same active i ngredient(s), be the same strength and the same dosage form as the brand-name product. 2. The FDA has given the generic an \"A\" rating compar ed to the branded product indicating bioequivalence, and has determined the generic is therapeutically equivalent to the reference brand. The ratings of generic drugs are available by referring to the FDA reference, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book). MedStar Family Choice - DC Healthy Fa milies and DC Healthcare Alliance Program 11 When the above two criteria are met, a generic can be substitute d with the full expectation that the substituted product will produce the same clinical effect and safety profile as the prescribed product. Drug products that have a narrow therapeutic index (NTI) can also be guided by these principles . It is not necessary for the health care provider to approach any one therapeutic class of drug products (e.g., NTI dr ugs) differently from any other class, when there has been a determination of therapeutic equivalence by the FDA fo r the drug products under consideration. Also, additional clinical tests or examinations by the physician are not needed when a therapeutically equiva lent generic drug product is substituted for the brand-name product. It is recommended that generic substitution not be exercised by the pharmacist with multisource products that appear in the Orange Book and carry a \"B\" rating, indicating t hat these products cannot be considered therapeutically equivalent to other products in the group. MAIL SERVICE PRESCRIPTIONS Mail order is available for chronic medications. A 90- day supply will be provided to members using mail order services. To start the process, prescribers may call CVS Caremark Mail Service Pharmacy at 1-800-996-5772 or they may submit a prescription to the CVS Caremark Mail Service Pharmacy. Additional information can be found at the MedStar Family Choice website, www.medstarfamilychoice.com or at www.caremark.com . Simply write the prescription(s) for a 90-day supply and have the member submit it with their mail-service request forms to the address listed on the Mail Service Order Fo rm. Prescribers may also call 1-800-996-5772 to start the process. Please note that medications ordered and processed through ma il service are typically mailed to the member via U.S. regular mail. As such, please advise members to allow up to 14 days for delivery from the time mail service receives the request. Any prescriptions submitted to mail service fo r less than a 90-day supply may be returned to the member. Members are also able to order their prescriptions from CVS Caremark Mail Service Pharmacy. Receiving a 90-day supply of medication by mail may prove to be more convenient for members, especially w hen filling prescriptions for routine or maintenance type medications. Mail service may also help members stay compliant with their medications. MEDICAL EXCEPTION If a non-covered drug is desired for medical management of a patient, a medication exception may be requested by calling MedStar Family Choice - DC at: 1-855-798-4244. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (PA) If a medication on Prior Authorization is needed for a member, it can be requested by calling MedStar Family Choice - DC at 1-855-798-4244 from 8 am to 5:30 pm. After hours, fo llow the instructions in the after-hours pharmacy message on the main telephone line. The following drugs and generic versions, if available, requi re prior authorization. This list is subject to change. Drugs requiring Prior - DC Healthy Fa milies and DC Healthcare Alliance The Managed Drug Limitation program provides for a maximu m quantity of drug product that a member may receive per prescription and/or over a specific period of time. Many drug products on the MedStar Family Choice - DC Health Families and DC Healthcare Alliance Prescribing Guide have quantity limits based upon the dosage described in product labeling. MedStar Family Choice limits \"new\" opioid analgesic prescripti ons to a 7-day supply. A \"new\" prescription means that a patient has not had an opioid medication filled under MedStar Family Choice in the preceding 90 days or had one short-acting opioid at < 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME ) per day in the previous 90 days, filled within 7 days of a subsequent request. New prescriptions for more t han 7-day supply will require Prior Authorization. The following drugs are subject to MDL because they are typically not taken on a regular schedule and/or because of potential safety and utilization concerns. This list is subjec t to change. Contact MedStar Family Choice - DC at 1-855- 798-4244 for an updated list.
