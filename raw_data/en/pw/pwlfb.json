Whatever it is, it is big; there are more than half a million websites on it, and it seems to me that a lot of dosh is being made with pranic healing. But what is it? [This website](http://www.desimd.com/alternative-medicine/ayurveda/pranic-healing) might be as good as any to explain: Pranic Healing is a form of ancient energy medicine, which utilizes the inherent energy Prana (life force or energy) to balance, and promote the body's energy and its processes. Prana is a Sanskrit word which actually means, the vital force that keeps us alive and healthy. Pranic healing is a holistic approach as it assumes a person in its complexity and does not separate the body and the mind. It was developed by Grand Master ChoaKok Sui who founded the World Pranic Healing Foundation. He is a Manila-based businessman of Chinese origin - a spiritual teacher, writer and therapist of Pranic healing system. According to ancient medicine, the body is composed of several physical elements including skin, bones, muscles, organs and so on which function with the help of Prana.The pranais present in the form of +ve and -ve ions. Pranic therapy or treatment involves the act of manipulating the energy (by experts) to restore the energy of the [chakras](http://www.desimd.com/alternative-medicine/yoga/balancing-chakras-the-energy-points-in-the-body) in the body which is believed to treat the condition. Although it's difficult to detect and measure life energy, its existence is undoubtedly proved... Following health issues can be successfully treated with Pranic healing: Sleeping illness (lack of sleep) Mental illnesses including depression, anxiety etc. Stress Sprains and strains Body aches like neck pain, muscle pain, back pain etc. A recent trauma and related inflammation Improve psycho-physical aspects in athletes Improve memory Enhance energy level Treat headache Fight ulcers (intestinal) Heal respiratory illnesses, including sinusitis and asthma Skin diseases, including eczema Improves overall immunity Treat the various causes of infertility Aesthetic treatments such as Pranic face lift, bust lift, hip and tummy tuck etc. Not only is pranic healing a true panacea, it also includes all the buzz-words any self-respecting charlatan wants to employ these days: - energy medicine - ancient wisdom - life force - holism - complexity - mind-body - chakras But the real beauty is, I think, that the existence of the energy - and by implication pranic healing - is undoubtedly proven! Should we believe this statement? Not without some evidence, I suggest. Medline lists all of 4 articles on the subject of pranic healing - not too difficult a task to summarise them quickly here: The [first paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19175256) is entirely evidence-free, but we learn the following interesting thing: \"When Pranic healing is applied the molecular structure of liquid and dense states of matter can be altered significantly to create positive outcomes, as revealed through research.\" The [second article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15040779) is not actually on pranic healing and contains no relevant information on it. The [third article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12889412) is merely a promotional essay for nurses that fails to include anything resembling evidence. The [fourth paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12056313) finally is much of the same again. So where is all this science supporting pranic healing? After all any treatment that can alter the molecular structure of matter must amount to a bit of a scientific sensation! Has the evidence perhaps been published in journals that are not Medline-listed? That I find difficult to imagine after realising that even the AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF HOLISTIC NURSING (one of the above 4 publications) is included in this database. And, in any case, such a scientific sensation deserves to be published in one of the leading science-journals! Could it be that there is not science to pranic healing at all? Could the whole thing be a hoax? I sure hope one of my readers can point me to the science thus proving my suspicion to "}
