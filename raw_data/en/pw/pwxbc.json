Since the earliest times, crystals have been used to heal and restore balance. They help in releasing and clearing negative energy, thereby assisting in energy healing. The earliest records of crystal healing have been traced in Ancient Egypt. Indias Ayurvedic records and traditional Chinese medicine also claim healing with the use of crystals, dating back to 5000 years ago. What are Crystals? Crystals are natures gift to man that augment healing. Crystals are found in all shapes, sizes, colours and composition. Each crystal has a unique vibrational resonance. They owe their unique qualities to their mineral content, their inherent geometry and the colour frequency they emit. Crystals and the Human Body The human body has a complex electromagnetic system, also known as a vibrational energy system. Nature has created crystals to be perfect electromagnetic conductors, capable of interacting with our electromagnetic system. Crystals have been found to carry vibration that activates certain energy centers within our electromagnetic system, thus having a positive effect on our entire body systems.
