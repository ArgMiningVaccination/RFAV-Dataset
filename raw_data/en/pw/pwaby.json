This circumstance isparadoxical because during thepast century scientific medicine or\"biomedicine\" hasacquired nearly absolute hegemony over American health care.

Urbanization, industrialization and migration brought polluted water, poor and contaminated food and milk, overcrowded housing, poverty, andsanitary ignorance. These conditions were disclosed bysanitary inspectors and public health reformers. Socio cultural factors were also largely responsible for theeventual eclipse ofinfectious diseases. But thorough study ofthesociocultural context ofthe19th-century \"sanitary revolution\" remains tobedone. The that was toprevent infectious dis- eases inthefuture was well under way inEuropean cities bythe 1870s. This movement was also tocontribute tothe near elimination ofsuch diseases from American cities. Ascities grew, sodid recognition that ageneral improvement ofthe standard of1jiving was necessary. Public health efforts brought miraculous changes inthe 1ength andquality of life for average people. The growth ofscientific medicine was very much apart ofthe urban context inwhich rapidly spreading infectious diseases demanded most theattention ofprofessional ofwhich professional noralternative medical inter pretations and inAmerica. Consequently, biomedicine received acultural endorsement that assured its gradual acquisition ofpower over medical interpretation andtreatment. preventive and therapeutic medicine. Evidence ofthis oftransition from the \"Golden Age\" of biomedicine for theCalifornia Board ofMedical Quality Assurance (Public Affairs Research Group 1981). This board istheregulatory agency that oversees thedefinition and licensing ofmedical practice pations aschiropractic, dentistry, nursing, optometry, osteopathy, pharmacy and psychology. Butalternative therapies such asthose men tioned ontheprevious page have not been recognized aspart oflegiti mate medical practice inthestate. Recent concern over thedefinition and licensing ofmedical practice resulted inaseries ofcolloquia to discuss where these alternatives fit into public regulation ofmedicine. Alternative medical approaches have begun tobeperceived asreal threats tothemedical establishment and/or tothepopulation, and aregenerating heated andpolitical confrontations. ideological andpolitical conflict isinnoway inthe state Itsorigins and analog beseen acentury ago in 1870s San Francisco when thebiomedical approach competed with anumber ofhealth care alternatives striving forpractical domination. The struggle and ultimate success ofthis scientific ideology inthehistory ofAmerican medicine has been well documented bymedical historians and medical sociologists. But the products ofmedical historians have been branded \"iatrocentric\" bysome because inmedical ideas.Medical anthropology can view this history from anentirely different perspective. What needs tobedone istoexplain why certain social definitions ofdisease came tobepredominant. Byintroducing asocial science \"from the some ofthestulti fied antecedent discussions andstress the experience ofthe sick rather than imposed professional definitions ofillness.

Again today those who suffer from chronic andunsuccessfully diagnosed and treated illnesses seek satisfactory explanations andsolutions. Approaches proposed thus far have not been dramatically successful. Inconsequence, amovement has developed inopposition tothe harsh and traumatic accom paniments tosurgery, drug therapies, high technology diagnostics and lengthy hospitalization. People are turning togentler and more humane therapies ofwholistic, preventive health approaches, whether ornot they areeffective inscientific terms. Clearly, some larger needs in thesocial definition ofillness, particularly asense ofpowerlessness, are being appealed to. Ifthetraditional historical narrative isrecast inthis way, a dramatic analogy between 1870s and 1970s (or80s) SanFrancisco emerges. Many medical historians have cited the conquest ofinfectious diseases asthe turning point intheevolution ofthevictory ofbiomedicineover itscompetitors. These diseases were socially defined and grouped before their bacterial orviral etiologies were known. As\"miasmatic\" and \"zymotic\" diseases they joined (a\"constitutional\" disease) asthe most frustrating challenge to19th-century therapeutics ofallkinds. They also devastated of19th-century population, and theterrifying threat ofmortality forindividuals andtheir families throughout their lifetimes. Today these diseases account for only asmall proportion ofannual inSan Francisco Leading causes ofdeath now are diseases oftheheart, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and other chronic non-infectious diseases (Center forHealth Statistics 1979-80). Chronic diseases dwell still inarealm ofambiguity and anxiety with regard toetiological explanation andeffective therapy. Similarly, in1870s San Francisco theill sought relief from the ineffective and harsh therapeutics towhich they were routinely subjected. They found numerous alternatives available which were certainly nomore nor less useful incuring their ailments, but were more satisfactory in treating the ambiguity ofetiological beliefs. Much ofthe success of any therapy lies inthehealer's ability totreat social beliefs about disease that gobeyond its physical manifestations. Those who were victorious inthe power struggle todictate thedefinition and treatment ofinfectious disease inthe 1870s were the ones whose medical ideology won widespread cultural endorsement.

The rest ofthis Introduction makes these views explicit. Cultural Construction ofIllness Inthe past decade orsomedical anthropologists have study disease andillness in1\u00edght oftheir cultural perspective\". This point ofview requires holistic consideration oftheentire cultural con text inwhich illness takes place, including its social history, apoint ofview often evoked, butrarely practiced. ofillness and \"hermeneutic accounts ofdivergent interpretations ofit\".

Its surrounding sociocultural context 1977; Kleinman, Eisenberg and Good 1978; Kleinman 1980; Young 1982). Another explanatory model developed bythese theorists isthecon ceptualization ofthepluralism ofhealth care into three sectors: the professional, the popular and the folk. These structural domains have not been specifically defined byethnomedical advocates, and they seem omi nously akin tothe outmoded division ofbelief systems into \"scientific, folk, andprimitive\" (Klein 1979: 205). Advocates suggest that each domain hasits own ideology, roles, settings, andinstitutions. The professional sector consists ofthe organized medical profession often described bymedical sociologists inthe West. Inany society this group has thegreatest legitimacy orsocial power. The popular domain consists offamily, social network and community medical resources. Itismore diffused through thesociety and bridges the gap betweeen professional and folk sectors. Inthis domain people decide that they are sick and consult their social network astoappropriate actions. Here illness and the maintenance ofhealth, notdisease, are central. The folk sector consists ofnonprofessional healers (Kleinman, Eisenberg and Good 1978; Kleinman 1980). Ihave adapted this model and used itheuristically to organize this thesis; but because itissoinadequately conceptualized, derived from crosscultural studies, understanding that the experience ofillness isaculturally constructed form ofsocial maydiffer cross-culturally sociological methods applied tohistorical research Thecentral problem ofethnomedical experiences. beliefs 1959; Berger and Agar 1980). Ethnomedical studies view healing as atransactional process across the explanatory models offolk, popular, andprofessional domains. It isregarded asadynamic process of disease. Thebiomedical model ashaving \"emasculated\" medical anthropology, distorting its research bydictating emphases on either healers ortheir patients, but not ontheclinical praxis between them (Kleinman 1978, 1980; Good and Good 1980). These theorists are attempting tofollow thedirection ofinterpre tive, hermeneutic and social interaction theories. The aim ofresearch is toreveal the social construction ofeveryday reality, the meanings be hind observable behavior. Thepositivist orempirical approach ofsocio cultural research isrejected asafalse tocontinually changing inter10 pretations ofvalues, attitudes, rules and customs. Anthropologists, trained tostudy cultural differences, are aware ofthe need for existential doubt about one's ownassumptions about reality.

Social construction ofreality theorists have been criticized for the same 1imitation. The significance ofpolitical and economic power, social inequalities and social classes isgiven insufficient weight. The medical system ofasociety isnot simply the product ofnegotiations between individuals and their diverse interpretations ofreality. Viewed historically, these actions clearly take onsignificance and imperatives oftheir own. Traditions and institutions are formed and become the basis forunquestioned actions. Inequalities inthedistribution ofpower preclude participation bymany individuals indecision-making. Social forces also determine which people suffer from which illnesses. Medical practices become ideological, justifying historically produced social re 1ations through which illnesses aredefined andtheir consequences de termined Starr 1982; Young 1982).11 Inother terms, anthropologists have been criticized for engaging inmicro-analysis rather than macro-analysis. Medical anthropologists have produced studies ofspecific medical systems based onfieldwork. But they have tended toignore therole ofhistory, change, political andother social structural forces. its 1egitimacy because authority isgiven itbythe society inwhich itexists. asoccurred inthehistory ofbiomedicine inthe Western world. Asphysicians gained cultural authority through identification with science late inthe19th-century they were able toprofessionalize, institutionalize and gain economic power (Janzen 1978; Starr 1981, 1982). The success ofthis medical ideology rested in1arge part ona transition that took place after the 1880s when bacteriology made it possible totruly define diseases asentities. During the 1870s specific names were used for those diseases wecall \"infectious\" today;\" but they did not have thespecific etiologies that have now given them separ ate existences.

Reification ofdiseases ignores thedifferent meanings given illnesses andtheir potential treatments individually, cross-culturally andhistorically. For example, asTaussig notes, the idea ofobject intrusion ascausation ofdisease isculturally universal. But only in biomedicine have itsassociated social connotations been disengaged from this explanation. Inthe 1870s moral and social etiological theories were still clearly expressed. Astime went onthey were moved tothe province ofpublic health approaches toinfectious disease. The medical pro fession retained only thesingle etiological explanation ofbacteriology orobject intrusion, stripped ofitslarger cultural reverberations.

Nevertheless, asynchronic focus be15 came dominant not todocument anthropological fashion, ethnohistorians give equal weight tooral traditions astodocumentary evidence. They have expanded their work to other societies aswell (Sturtevant 1966; Euler 1972; Wylie 1973; Schwerin 1976). Independent anthropologists have also produced excellent historical studies (Balandier 1969; Wallace 1978; Wolf 1982). Inmany cases both social andcultural anthropologists conducted at least partial historical studies ofthesocieties with which they were concerned. But none achieved thesophistication ofFrench social his\u2014 torians ofthe same time period. Members school ofsocial history were chiefly concerned with mentalit\u00e9 orculture. They attempted especially todocument theordinary life and popular attitudes and values ofsocial experience (Forster and Ranum 1975). Thus they conducted historical with anessentially anthropological focus. Acorollary ofthe imputed ahistoricism science model, anempiricist andquantitative methodology.

Many historians have also felt that itwas necessary tomake history more scientific and have introduced rigorous methods ofquantifica16 tion andstatistical analysis. These approaches tend tobebased that forexplanation inboth history and anthropology, anditwill always entail value judgments. Itisdoubtful that the hypothetico -deductive model will ever produce historical Traditionally histories ofmedicine have been narrow studies of medical men, practices, andinstitutions. Some medical historians such asHenry Sigerist, George Rosen, and Charles Rosenberg have brought a sociological perspective totheir study andcall for examination ofwhat actually happened topeople inthehistory ofhealth and disease. But the primary framework forinterpretation inmedical history has been one \"conquest\" assuming aprogressive development knowledge and ofdisease. Thus ithas been aniatrocentric history ofour own folk model ofbiomedicine. Medical anthropologists and medical historians have equally come under thespell ofour owncultural model, providing little inthe way ofalternative interpretive work. But more medical historians are nowcalling for asociocultural approach (Rosen 1967; ofliterature from both anthropology andhistory, butitdepends upon primary materials popular 1870s inSan Francisco because itwas atime period substantial changes took place inthehistory ofmedicine inthis coun try.

Inanthropological terms, these physicians have presented askey informants. Itisacommon anthropological experience tobeled astray bymembers ofthe eagerly put themselves forward asinterpreters oftheir culture. Abalanced analysis requires seeking information from those most reluctant orunable toprovide it. Inhistorical research one isdefeated inthis quest because theilliterate poor and ethnic immigrants have remained largely inarticulate, leaving usonly indirect evidence oftheir experiences. Ifollow the model ofethnographic research thesocial and economic setting of1870s San Francisco inthefirst fewchapters. For this description Irely sources, although Iuse primary materials toget asense ofhow San Franciscans themselves felt about life intheir city inthe 1870s.

They regarded these causes asaberrations inan otherwise healthy city. Inreality disease statistics reveal that the foreign-born and especially their children were thevictims ofin fecious diseases. Health officers realized this bythe end ofthe decade and began toregard this population asaberrant aswell. Part Two tackles the regular medical profession, its ideology and therapeutics.

Part Three discusses popular andsectarian alternatives including thewell-established pro fessional medical groups ofhomeopaths andeclectics. The ethnomedical division ofmedical practice into professional, popular, and folk sectors breaks down atthis point because itdoes not provide for competing but equally professional sects. Inthis section Ialso discuss thevery popu lar and common alternative ofpatent medicines available to1870s San Franciscans.

Itwas necessary forphysicians todiscredit their rivals togain the legitimacy they retain today. Bythe end ofthe decade they had succeeded ingaining sufficient cultural authority tosee astate medical law passed defining andlimiting medical practice.

The controversies surrounding enactment ofthis first law resonate today as Californians again debate theregulation ofmedical practice and regular \"quackery\". physicians object tothe competition and dangers of Part Four addresses the folk medicine alternative that continued to exist aswell asthe therapeutic approach ofclimatotherapy, which crossed theboundaries ofprofessional, popular and folk sectors. That this three-part classification isanetic category isevident; for ordinary people might equally resort toany one ofthese alternatives, or ofregular medicine andallitsalternatives. This evidence indicates clearly that what people suffered wasillness, not disease. Often they did not even use contemporary disease names, but simply reported themselves ill. The common conception ofthe human body was one inwhich symptoms were illness; and they might betreated ina number ofdifferent ways. Specific etiologies andspecific disease en tities were often identified neither byphysicians nor their patients.

Almost all had come for economic improvement intheir lives, ifnot to\"strike itrich\". They came with the Gold Rush and for thesilver mines. Orthey came toprofit from serving the needs ofother immigrants. Huge numbers ofthem left when their quests failed. Fewfelt any civic responsibility tobuild a community inSanFrancisco's first decades. Itwas nonetheless unavoidable that great economic and population changes would create anurban society there. Very few who stayed acquired great wealth. Many found themselves worse off than before. Initially inthe 1850s and 1860s skilled laborers were needed toserve the new entrep\u00f4t. SanFrancisco became thetrade center andfreight handler of the West Coast. Several organizations were founded by1ocal businesses toencourage took place the economic realities ofthecity were changing. Industrialization here aselsewhere altered thenature of work. Skilled artisans and craftsmen were less needed than were unskilled machinery operators. The labor supply increased, asdid competition for jobs and unemployment. Completion ofthetranscontinental railroad in 1869 aggravated thesituation. Great numbers ofpeople migrated toSan Francisco ontrains from the East, and many others released from rail23 road construction came tothe city for work. Production inthe Nevada silver mines failed because offires and floods; sominers also retreated tothecity. After 1870 became asocial problem (Scott 1959; Shumsky 1972, 1976; Lawrence 1979). Great millionaires grew enormously rich building the Central Pacific Railroad. Expected economic benefits tothe community from the railroad did notmaterialize, however. Its completion exposed apre viously isolated community which had setits ownprices and wages. The city now faced competition from the rest ofthe country. Eastern goods became available and San Francisco nolonger controlled astrictly Western trade network. Thefull weight of anational business cycle was now felt onthe West Coast. Themillionaires profited; the city did not. Asthe decade ofthe 1870s began San Francisco suffered financial depression and unemployment. Adrought haddisastrously affected agricultural profits. The stock ex change fell because ithad been took place inthe United States, followed byadepression that lasted until 1877.

Figures onunemployment were unreliable, even asthey are today. Some estimated that twenty per cent inthestate were out ofwork. Charities inSan Francisco reported that they were feeding many people24 (Shumsky 1972: 53, 118-119). Frequently people were only semi-employed, unable tosupport families, and lacking inall but theessentials for existence. Unskilled laborers were not the only ones who suffered during this period. Merchants and businessmen suffered three times asmany bank ruptcies inthe 1870s asthey had inthe previous decade. Earlier merchant businesses were taken over by\"slaughtering, meat packing; sugar 1978: 237-239, 167, 177). Occupational mobility declined. Opportunities for blue collar workers toenter the white collar class had been greater inthe 1850s.

Other ethnic differences inoccupation existed. Germans, often Jewish, tended tobemerchants. Italians were shopkeepers orfruit, vegetable and fish peddlers and dealers. Many Irish were also shop keepers. Blacks were present atseveral social levels, both working and25 middle class. Some Blacks had Chinese servants.

Bankruptcy, Suicide, and plunder and robberies were the order ofthe day (Roney n.d.) The experiences ofJames Galloway insmall towns near San Francisco were also typical.

He commented Man but with aconscience clear that Iam anhonest man (Galloway 1853-1882: 10/7/1879). Pessimism was widespread inSanFrancisco and was augmented byincreased illness, suicide, crime, and other urban problems. Immigrants were blamed for these changes andefforts were made tocontrol their entry (Lawrence 1979: 28-39). Many workers found that they could not marry and have children because the cost of 1iving was sohigh. Roney commented inhis diary about his indebtedness: Mywife's anticipated sickness [parturition] isnot yet arrived which will leave mebetter prepared for the event when itdoes take place (Roney 1875-76: May 1875). These two years past have been aperiod ofgreat trial tomywife (Roney 1875-76: January 1876). Even those who found jobs worked long hours under poor conditions.

They shared thecapitalists' belief that anexcess ofnew immigration was responsible for employment prob lems. The Chinese especially were blamed. Inthe summer of1877 the WPC engaged inamajor 1981). The 1880s brought amore tranquil period toSan Francisco. The city stabilized new sources ofcapital infactories, agriculture, and railroad andshipping industries. They \"were years ofsober, patient advance, free from thespeculative madness, theshattering crashes, and misery inthe 1870s hadinsight into the economic conditions they observed. For example, William Laird MacGregor, travelling for theWanderer's Club ofPall Mall in1876 remarked onSan Francisco's high suicide rate and the crowded stock exchange in\"this vast gamble forwealth\". Hefelt however, that working men would suffer ifthey \"steady\" anddidn't drink (MacGregor that trade ofthe place, and way inwhich andothers goto the wall, while the seem tobetroubled bynoseared consciences\" (Trollope 1951: 541-544, orig. pub. 1875). Rabbi Isaac Wise carried this theme astep further, noting that land, business, andcapital were all inthe hands of afew, andthat there were many poor men inthecity (Wise 1967: 12,orig. pub. 1877). Ilike these meetings very much. Itdid seem nice to see somany poor people there taking such aninterest inreligious matters. There were two men intheir overalls. nice 10oking men but looked asthough they were very poor and had towork very hard. They sat beside usand sang away with awill from their sing- ing book. They all feel that they can gotoMr. Hammonds meeting and think nothing oftheir clothes and feel attheir ease.

Several commented onthe WPC street demonstrations Amelia Ransome resentment ofcoolies became theinspiration of senseless violence; and the Sand-Lot Riots resulted.\" She commended the use ofpick-axe handles bytheCitizens' Committee todisperse the crowds (Neville 1932: 197-198). Rabbi Wise happened tobevisiting San Francisco during thefateful period. Heidentified the unemployed protestors with SanFrancisco's \"hoodlums\", who often attacked Chinese (Wise 1967: 16-19, orig. pub. 1877). Population and Ethnic Composition The San Francisco Bay Area was anatural magnet tothe many immigrants who responded toCalifornia's appeal. One young woman later recalled conversations about California she overheard asasmall child inPennsyl vania. Her mother, \"who was very delicate, though notreally ill, said very little but she looked very queer when anyone spoke that name.\" Various friends andrelatives, including her father, began tostudy maps. Herparents did notdiscuss plans itorhearing and Iconnected itwith been brought out and packed atnight. Mymother looked pale, and mygrandmother stepped about much more quickly29 than usual and her chin waslifted rest ofthe family joined him inOakland several years later, just after the great San Francisco fire of1852. Many such travel accounts might becited toillustrate thegreat East toWest population movement. California's population increased by over half amillion between the Gold Rush and 1870. Most immigrants were men born elsewhere inthe United States (Wright 1941; 73-74). The primary inducement was the promise ofeconomic betterment. Those whose dreams hadfailed elsewhere migrated West for newpossibilities. The nine counties ofthe San Francisco Bay Area especially felt this population increase. Population there gained 133 per cent between 1860 and 1870. During this same decade thestate gained 47per cent inpopu lation. Half the aquarter tripled between and 1870 (Scott 1959: 50). San Francisco was thefifteenth largest city inthe country atthe beginning oftheCivil War (population according tothe U.S. Census of 1860 was 56,802). Thecity population grew cent inthe States, with apopulation of233,959. Not only was there aphenomenal growth in population during these two decades, butitwas adynamic movement, with much turnover among unskilled manual laborers people30 1959: 62). Because ofthis dramatic change inpopulation, actual figures were very contradictory. The uncertainty about total population figures becomes important inthecalculation ofdeath rates forthis period. Most commentators refer toofficial U.S.Census figures for thecity; but these were always considerably lower than figures produced bycity directories (Table One). Federal officials admitted tocensus defects (U.S. Census 1872: xlvii, xix-xxv). The 19th-century asawhole was afrustrating time for those who could foresee the census asamechanism for information gather ing. European census figures were used todetermine public policies. But the United States did not recognize this function of afederal census. Instead the census was used todetermine political representation only. Early censuses did attempt aninadequate enumeration ofthe deaf, blind, illiterate, feeble-minded and insane. But counts ofvital events (births anddeaths) begun after 1850 tothis class, are anumber who escape the canvass altogether, and alarge foreign element that does not speak the English language. These, together with aconsiderable number ofpersons residing indisreputable neighborhoods, aggregating over ofthe permanent population. ...These figures donotinclude 170,000 172,750 200,770 230,000 330,000 305,000SOURCE Health 150,361 186,000 185,000 280,000 300,000 300,000U.S. Census 149,473 233,95932 This explanation accounts for theconsistently higher city directory than federal census figures. Italso suggests howunreliable health statistics for the city were during the 1870s. Ofparticular interest tothe study ofinfectious diseases during this decade isjust this immigrant and foreign-born group. All new San Franciscans experienced thehardships andprivations ofmigration andfell victim toconsequent diseases. But bycultural and language handicaps, poverty, anddiscrimination, sothat they always appeared heavily inthelists ofill and dead. AsSan Francisco first settled between 1850 and 1860 about half its population had foreign birthplaces, compared toone intenresidents of the United States generally. The city occupied third place inthe country asanimmigrant center in1860 ofimmigrants were from Ireland, states (U.S. Census 1872: 386-391, 598; 1883: 538- 541). The percentage offoreign-born intheoverall Pacific region of the country was only 3.1 per cent in1870; while itwas 34.1 per cent intheMiddle Atlantic region (Ward 1971: 51, 67). Thus SanFrancisco's population composition was unusual. inthecity reflect generation people offoreign heritage were taking their places inSan Francisco social life.

There was also adeliberate effort tolimit family size bythis time. (Decker 1978: 325; Burchell 1980: 73, 87). One AsSan became anindustrial city inthe 1870s, the labor Supply workers increased tothe point ofchronic unemploy- ment.

Heboth romanticized and humanized thelife Similar toWiggins' Ransome Neville, who lived afashionable life inSan Francisco. For example, she said ofthis period that, Chinatown was areally exciting place. Itwasthrilling even insmallpox epidemics when thepolice guarded all entrances and yellow plague flags were flying over the quarter. But forall the lack ofsanitation and bland disregard for Western ideas oflaw andorder, SanFran cisco never resented its presence. Itwasstoo fascinatinginits 1jife and color (Neville 1932 :197). This romantic view ofthe\"color\" ofethnic life was commonly expressed bythose who regarded immigrants simply asfeatures ofthecity's cosmo politan tone. For example, Samuel Williams wrote \"Nowhere else arewitnessed the fusing ofsomany races, thejuxtaposition ofso many nationalities, the Babel ofsomany tongues. Every country onthe globe, every state andprincipality, almost every island ofthe sea, finds here itsrepresentative\" (Williams 1921: 15). Atthe same time, Williams had theillusion that the working class inSan Francisco was \"exceptionally prosperous,\" and that many owned their own homes. Heagreed with Wiggin about the\"forever-out-of-workers\". Anyone who did not work \"aworthless too lazy \"AnIrish woman had abite toeat today, etc., for one dime\" 12,orig. pub. 1877). During the decade ofthe 1870s San Francisco began theprocess of settlement inwhich families appeared and neighborhoods took on particular characters. Construction ofhousing did not keep upwith thelevel ofimmigration and increase thehighest figures inthe country. In1870 thefigures for San Francisco had been 5.77 and 4.89, respectively (U.S. Census 1872; 1978: 212). The foreign-born, inspite ofefforts to limit their family sizes, still had larger families than thenative born.\" Peter Decker (1978) has calculated that native-born merchants in 1880 San Francisco had anaverage household size of6.4 people and family size of2.8; while foreign-born merchants had anaverage household of6.0 people and family of3.4 (Decker 1978: 317). The larger household of thenative-born may have been because ofthe presence ofservants or boarders. The significance ofboarding tofamily arrangements in19th century America isasubject scientists (Modell and Hareven 1973; Katz 1975). TheIrish were probably most representative ofthe problems of immigrant adjustment toSanFrancisco inthe 1870s. They composed the largest percentage oftheforeign-born population; appeared most frequently inmorbidity andmortality statistics; they46 lived inSouth ofMarket neighborhoods; and they were settled with families including small children. They were also most likely, after the Chinese, tobetargets ofdiscrimination. By1870 theIrish lived inthefirst, seventh, ninth, tenth, and eleventh wards ofthecity, especially inthe seventh, which was along thewaterfront south ofMarket Street. During the decade ofthe 1870s they moved into the ninth and eleventh wards tothe south and west, but their population remained most dense inthe seventh. Forty tofifty per cent ofthe South ofMarket area ofIrish for both 1870 and inward seven, although the American-born predominate. Occupations inthe ward are those oflaborers and various working class employments, including anumber of female Irish servants. Ward eleven reveals Irish grocers, butchers, and areal-estate dealer, indicating thebetter-off Irish working class laborers ordomestics, aswehave seen. The Irish accounted for 34per cent ofthe servant class inthe city in1880, and only 13per cent ofthetotal population. Many of them could afford tolive only incongested neighborhoods inunsanitary andunhealthful conditions. Family life was either nonexistent ordis rupted bythe burdens oflabor and poverty. Children joined gangs of hoodlums. But Irishmen were able toorganize themselve politically, in theDemocratic Party aswell asthe Workingmen's Party. They became involved incity government and took jobs asfiremen, policemen, and Irish-born appeared ontherolls ofpublic institutions and charities. There were numerous mutual aid associations set upbytheIrish, but they relied heavily onpublic institutions as well. Irish appeared inprisons andhospitals and the almshouse. Statis tics show aconsistently much higher proportion ofIrish than other nationalities inthe San Francisco Almshouse between 1869 and 1894. Burchell suggests this excess accounted byfavoratism onthepart ofwomen inthe almshouse, Mary Roberts Smith found that among these \"erratic creatures\" 59.2 per cent were Irish, as were 41.3 per cent ofthetotal almshouse population. Her study indi cates became ofIrish women who migrated toSan Francisco inthe 1870s. She concluded that the Irish women were \"1ess efficient in domestic employments, more liable todrink, and more illiterate than female emotionality 15). Smith realized that what had happened tomany ofthese women was simply that their husbands had died and they were unprepared for any form ofself-support. Ofthe Irish women inthe almshouse in1895 71.2 sothey were intheir thirties andforties been either married orindomestic service. Eighty-three per cent had been immigrants. Most were admitted aspaupers because ofintemperance (Smith some cultural resonance:48 They're just ready tobepaupers when they come over. There isn't any usetrying toget ahead in Ireland, forwhatever you put onthe land only makes therent more; sothere isn't any use saving. And they can't bestrong, because they live mostly on potatoes, corn-meal, and sour milk (Smith 1895: 13-14). Several oftheindividual stories ofthese women may bekept in aswemove ontoexamine public health inSan Francisco and statistics oninfectious disease inthe next chapter. For example, a 69year old widow migrated toSanFrancisco in1870 and was admitted tothe almshouse nineteen years later with rheumatism andneuralgia, Her husband had been English, son, twenty-six could not support her, was recently drowned\". Another 71year old German immigrant was adomestic servant when she came toSanFrancisco in1870. She was a\"worn-out scrub woman,\" admitted tothe for old age and sore legs. Ayounger, 51year old widow who had been adomestic was admitted asanintemperate prostitute. Her data revealed: \"Husband recently killed; four children ofdiphtheria and measles; untruthful, vulgar\" (Smith 1895; Table XVII). City Surprisingly, many visitors found SanFrancisco anunattractive city inthe 1870s. William Laird MacGregor, cannot becalled apretty orapicturesque town. simply ofbricks mortar, stone and commented onthe \"dense cloud ofsmoke\" that resulted from coal-burning exile, wrote poetically San Francisco inthe 1870s.

Hesaid that among the impressive buildings of the main streets: There are humble structures, always with pointed roofs and always coming singly. These are poor-appearing carriage shops, stables, 1aundries, orwarehouses heaped with tallow and stinking hides. From them issue ragged and ill-kempt monsters whose dripping shirts are an offense toeye and nose. And behind the palaces run filthy alleys, orrather nasty dungheaps without side walks orillumination, whose loiterers smell or therichest men down-at-the-heel inaprons and evil smells inaperfumed garden. .. .Ladies ride in1andaus and carriages, leaning back negligently ontheir furs, white veils floating over their flowered hats.

Heconcluded that \"Living air, not what MacGregor had Harriet Lane Levy also recalled thecolorful aspect ofSanFran cisco's ethnic mixture. She wrote that the Saturday night promenade on Market Street was a\"carnival\" ofpeople (Levy 1975: 258, feared their influence: \"The effect onsociety has perhaps been detrimental.

Thepart ofthe community most famous for vice was that known by the 1860s asthe Barbary Coast. Thecondition ofthese women wasquite pathetic, especially those who Chinese slaves (Asbury 1933: 108-109, 114-115, 177-182).

And Hell, yawning to receive theputrid mass, isthere also (Lloyd 1876: 78-80). Inspite ofsuch tantalizing descriptions, most upper class people,53 women, were unaware oforchose toignore the Barbary Coast.

They were also places where typhus wastransmitted bylice. The same areas later became centers fortuberculosis. They additionally suffered from the continual endemic diseases weshall discover inSan Francisco in Chapter Four: scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, influenza, and Qthers (beteger 1966.

Until then most aid for immigrants came through their own aid networks andorganizations, and through charities andprivate benevolent groups. TheNineteenth-Century Public Health Movement The most significant health advance ofthe 19th-century was thesani tary reform orpublic health movement. The reformers were scientists, physicians, epidemiologists andpublic officials. The movement began in Europe and England asawareness grew that illhealth, especially infectious disease, wasseriously disabling theworking population. Thepublic health movement hadonly gradual effect intheUnited States. Both local andnational governments intervened inpublic health only very late in the century, and there was much political resistance totheir doing so.

John Snow and William Budd were able todemonstrate thespecific transmission ofcholera and typhoid fever inthewater supply. Several public health reports, more modest inscope, were published intheeastern United States New York Citizen's Association Council ofHygiene thinking inSanFrancisco. Weshall seeinthenext chapter that San Francisco physicians, while not sharing the public health consciousness \u00b0fthese unusual men, struggled todemonstrate lowmortality figures for their community, compared toother cities.

But weknow this reality only with hindsight. There were few such efforts intheUnited States during theperiod inwhich they occurred inEngland shall see, inSan Francisco as1ate asthe 1880s there was very little understanding ofsuch ideas. The medical profession remained conserva- tive intheir reliance ontherapeutic approaches. Among afew ofthe alternative health practices however, the importance ofsanitation and personal hygiene received emphasis. San Francisco experienced theill effects ofindustrialization much later inthe century than did thecities ofEurope and theeastern United States. Ideas from these places floated into San Francisco haphazardly, much asdid theinfectious diseases brought byimmigrants social and disease realities confronted aninadequately prepared medical community. Several writers have argued that improvement inpublic health did not occur inthe United States until the 1880s. Using life expectancy at birth asamajor indicator, Edward Meeker (1972) concludes that itdid not improve until 1ate inthe19th-century when fewer children were killed byinfectious diseases. Heargues too that death rates decreased anddisease-specific death rates changed significantly only after 1880. Theinfectious diseases were those primarily affected. Meeker, like McKeown andothers, believes medical practice hadlittle todowith this change. Other important features may have been genetic changes inthe disease organisms themselves, improvements inpublic health efforts, and62 improvements inlevel ofliving such asbetter diet and housing and installation ofsewers and clean water supplies. From what weknow to day about susceptibility toand transmission ofthe major- diseases ofthe19th-century, thepublic health argument makes sense. Certainly there waslittle change inthis regard inSan Francisco until well after the decade ofthe 1870s. Alan Marcus (1979) identifies afurther explanation for the slowness ofchange inhealth statistics inthe19th-century. Because ofthe belief that disease was notcontagious (see Part Two) local andstate boards ofhealth regarded disease asacommunity problem. Itwas not until there was more acceptance ofgerm theory that thesignificance ofthewider society was implicated. After the 1880s attention was given tomilk supplies, contaminated byunsanitary processing andtransportation. Disease prevention began tobeseen asanational problem bythe20th century. San Francisco inthe 1870s and localized concerns ofthat period. \"Masses ofPutrid Matter'': San Francisco Public Health The infectious diseases from which San Francisco suffered most dramatically, asweshall see inthe next chapter, were smallpox, diphther ia,typhoid, scarlet fever, measles, andinfluenza. Tuberculosis and malaria figured continually inhigh mortality and morbidity statistics. Henry Harris (1932) has summarized public health conditions inthecity. Epidemics brought aflurry ofactivity; but 1880s. sufficient attention63 during the 1870s foreffective action. But lone voices were heard on thesubject throughout theperiod.\" Asearly as1868 the following editorial Inmany places throughout thesouthern portion of thecity there are houses under which water 1\u00edes theyear round. This becomes decomposed during the summer weather, andmalarial diseases ofgreat in tensity, insidious pneumonia and rheumatic fever spring upinconsequence. These nuisances can be readily abated byphysicians notifying the Health Officer oftheir existence, and wetrust our advice onthis subject will not bedisregarded bythe profession (California Medical Gazette 1868: 1:16-17). That year another editorial inthis journal advised the use ofcarbolic acid asapreventive against theprevailing smallpox epidemic (California Medical Gazette Nov. 1868: 111). Ifactually carried out, this effort might have had some effect onthe smallpox virus, which spreads on bedding and other objects incontact with thepatient. Carbolic acid is apowerful, but caustic antiseptic. Only the next year, Dr. Arthur B.Stout waswriting onthe subject that would dominate San Francisco public health writings through the decade: sewage. Hisarticle detailed theconstruction ofthecity's sewers and tothis toflush away dangerous substances. But hediscussed other disinfectants andcalled generally for apreventive and hygienic approach (Stout 1869). In1870 Board ofSupervisors began topresent discussion of thesubject ofsewers intheir fiscal year municipal reports. The Health Officer was aware that the wards with highest disease statistics inthe city \"are miserably provided with sewerage\":64 The Second Ward nosewerage, and isdensely popu lated with alarge proportion for theordinary comforts oflife, and that isafruitful source ofTyphoid Fever. The First, Ninth and Tenth Wards are very poorly drained.

The Health Officer, Dr. C. M.Bates, attributed cholera and typhoid and typhus tothis source, probably accurately inthe ofthefirst two. Hecomplained that ordinance requiring privies, sinks and drains tobeconnected tostreet sewers allowed all thedrain age from elevated parts ofthe city toreach and accumulate intheflat land. This action accounted ..1870-71: 310). Asweshall see inPart Two, fear ofcontaminating sewage from the etiology, not from anunderstanding of bacteriology. Anumber ofSan Francisco doctors supported this point ofview in their writings. Citing Stout's article specifically, Dr. J.Campbell Shorb called Surgical Journal argued in1874 that sewers themselves were the problem. Thecity ofPhiladelphia remained healthy, itsaid, be cause open cesspools and sewers, were used there (PMSJ the sunbursts forth and dries itup, and then weknow not the hour when this magazine offever will open upon usandcut usdown likethe sword ofadevastating andrelentless (Hall 1867: 78-79). The next several Health Officers ofSan Francisco continued the campaign for improved sanitation inthecity. Henry Gibbons, Jr. wrote ofitin1875 and J.L.Meares in1876 (San Francisco Municipal Reports .. ..1874-75; Thelatter commented that most ofthecity outlet andventilation, orall ofthese features atonce: \"they theequally system which hasalready made adisease-breeding swamp ofaconsiderable portion Francisco Municipal Reports. ...1876-77: 391). Meares began abattle specifically against the Chinese Inhis indiphtheria, typhoid fever, smallpox and other dis \u20acases. The Health Officer was supported inpart bythe San Francisco news\u2014 paper press. From 1870 onarticles newspapers calling cleaning ofthe\"filthy streets\" (e.g., seeDaily. Alta California Feb. The\"filth\" instreets not rivulets when itrained carrying discharges from slaughter66 houses, stables, overflowing garbage and leaking sewage. Simply the presence ofthousands ofhorses produced aproblem totally unfamiliar toustoday. Horse manure attracted enormous numbers ofhouseflies. Health officials inRochester, New York once estimated that horses of thecity inone year produced enough manure tocover anacre 175 feet high, breeding sixteen million flies. The role offlies asdisease vectors was not understood inthe 1870s, but most people believed inthe miasmatic theory. According tothis viewpoint, rotting organic and vegetable matter inthestreets was responsible fordisease. During the summer dry season inSanFrancisco thecity's winds must have blown dry horse manure and other refuse over people's faces, clothes and merchandise, and inopen windows (Tarr 1971; Leavitt 1982: 70-71). Unlike other western cities, San Francisco did have mechanical sweeping machines by 1880, probably asaresult ofthis newspaper agitation. They cleaned busy streets once aweek, being only partly effective (Larsen 1978: 62). While J.P.Meares was Health Officer the San Francisco Chronicle joined hissanitation campaign, butcriticised his methods. For example, inJanuary 1877 aneditorial complained that heand hisinspectors told people who had \"bad smelling yards\" from defective sewers that smallpox didnotarise from this cause. Consequently people did not clean upand smallpox continued (San Francisco Chronicle Jan. 4,1877). Undoubtedly, thedisease would have continued inany event since itisnot spread in contaminated water. The newspaper further commented that month: \"The city was never inadirtier orworse sanitary condition than now. There arepestilential pools and spots all over it, and by no means the worst ofthem inthe Chinese quarter. AtNorth Beach there isaliteral 1ake offilth whose exhalations are rank with the most malignant diseases\"67 (San Francisco Chronicle Jan. 29, 1877: 2). The paper attributed the city's high death rate, and theprevalence ofdiphtheria and smallpox, tothese conditions. The public wasnaturally influenced bynewspaper revelations about the San Francisco sewer system. ABritish visitor who described life in the good hotels ofthecity commented that each room was equipped with amarble washstand with hot and cold water. This arrangement saved servants having tocarry water, butitmeant \"direct communication with the sewers and drains. Itishowever common toall Hotels inthe United this point ofview. For example, inthe medical press that same year itwas claimed that diphtheria did notarise from drains, sewers and water closets: \"In thecity ofSanFrancisco many ofits most fatal visitations were dwellings, where hygienic laws were strictly enforced ... .itwas often most active andfatal intowns andrural districts which every apparent hygienic advantage\" 1877 Aug. No. 3:117-118). Again, thecity was facing adisease communicated bypersonal contact. But the Health Officer continued his crusade toimprove thecondition ofsewers inhis municipal reports for therest ofthe decade. public health reformers were physicians. Bythe end ofthe 1870s the medical profession adopted sanitary matters as part ofits sphere ofresponsibility. For example, the major medical journal ofthecity commented in1878 that the public health movement thejournal continued toencourage members oftheprofession tosupport hygienic measures. They were reminded that \"Sooner orlater death must come, and this will always give business tothedoctor\". Besides, re duction inchildhood mortality would increase their numbers ofpatients, and these people would be\"feebly constituted, role ofmedicine incompetition with public health efforts.

Infectious diseases especially are spread bypeople onthe move. The urban settle ments of19th-century European 1ater inthecentury nopublic mechan- isms existed tocoordinate public health actions. Chaos occurred during epidemics. Immigrants were often blamed forcreating andspreading dis- ease. Itwas argued that they were being punished byGod for immoral behavior. Because ofthelack ofpublic aid, immigrants had torely heavily ontheir own InGreat Britain and Europe thepublic was highly developed bythe 1870s. Butinterest inhealth asa public matter was much slower incoming totheUnited States. Physicians inSan Francisco were familiar with the European social medicine movement, buttheir suggestions forsanitary reform were stymied physicians, ofthe use ofvital statistics and epidemiological methods. Inaccurate beliefs about theetiology ofinfectious disease ironically propelled thesanitary reforms which actually didprevent these diseases. But reforms were slower inSan Francisco than incities oftheeastern U.S.Certainly disease prevention was regarded asonly alocal community concern, even when epidemics swept the whole nation. InSan Francisco those concerned with public health, chiefly the Health Officer, focused onthestate ofthe sewer system inthe 1870s. Sewage drained through street sewers from individual cesspools, privies, anddrains. Thecity's hilly... terrain caused sewage from the ,r heights toflow totheflatlands, creating acontamination ofpoorer by richer neighborhoods. Thecondition ofSanFrancisco's sewers undoubtedly did increase incidence oftyphoid ...and cholera.

Thefirst, John Williamson Palmer, found itimpossible asCity Physician HOLDS OFINFECTIOUS DISEASE \"Died from Natural Causes\": The Collection ofVital Statistics The California State Board ofHealth was established in1870 and Dr. Thomas M.Logan' became its Permanent Secretary. Healso assumed theoffice ofRegistrar ofBirths, Marriages and Deaths. Herecommended tothelegislature that they pass anew act requiring registration of vital statistics bylocal boards ofhealth. Logan began thedifficult process ofsending circulars, blank forms and schedules toCounty Clerks, Recorders, officers ofcharitable organizations, hospitals, prisons, andprivate physicians tocollect mortality statistics (State Board of Health, First Biennial Report... 1870 and 1871: 3,19, 22, 49, 54). Faced with the overwhelming difficulties ofcollecting reliable statistics, Logan attempted toexplain some ofthepitfalls. But healso argued forcefully for thevalue ofvital statistics: Faithfully collected andskilfully managed, these statistics furnish accurate knowledge ofthe most im- portant facts ofeach citizen, and also the data upon which governments and communities, aswell asindivi duals, may base their action. ...the prevalency and fatality ofevery disease, and 1ikewise theratio of deaths aspecial disease tothetotal number of ofthe same disease; that is, the chance ofre covery, when attacked bythis disease, are revealed.

The Health Officer ofSan Francisco, Dr. C. was faced with asimilar problem. Hesaid in1870: Inconsequence ofthe heterogeneous nomenclature of byour professional brethren, aproper nosological arrangement isalmost impossible. This ismore particularly the case, when physicians fill out acertificate ofthe death ofa patient and give the cause asbeing for want ofbreath,73 ordied from natural causes (S. . . 1869-70: 214). Deaths attributed tomarasmus heargued, \"wasting away from adefect ofnourishment,\" acondition most people reach before death. \"The Very Extreme ofNecessary Mortality\": Overall Mortality Statistics Inthe ofoverall mortality thecity inthe become clear how theunreliability andpopulation figures make any conclusions suggestive atbest. The Health Officer calculated SanFrancisco's mortality rate each year. Itwas also reported inthe annual reports oftheState Board of Health. While Henry Gibbons, Jr. was Health Officer (until 1878) the fig- ures appeared inthePacific Medical and Surgical Journal.\" The mortality calculated bydividing the rawmortality, collected asdescribed, bythepopulation atrisk. oronfigures reported intheannual city directory edited byHenry Langley. Often the Health Officer calculated his own estimate ofpopulation somewhere between the two. Aswesaw in Chapter One, population figures were quite unreliable. Thus, mortality rates were based onunreliable death reports andunreliable population estimates. However, they were relied upon toprove that San Francisco was anunusually healthy city. Table Four shows themortality rates between 1866 and 1881 for the city, and thepercentages ofdeaths reported from zymotic and miasmatic (infectious) diseases.

Weshall discuss these diseases more specifically later in the chapter. Atthe opening ofthe decade, Thomas Logan introduced the theme of SanFrancisco's \"salubrity\". This concept was tobepromoted inhealth statistics for the rest ofthe 1870s. Given the tentative nature of these figures both inSan Francisco and other cities, itissurprising that their reporters insisted onmaking comparisons. Table Five shows how San Francisco compared toother cities early inthe decade. Logan reported in1871 that San Francisco was second only toSt. Louis ingood health, with adeath rate of21.4 per thousand. Hesaid enthusiastically, \"with good drainage, sewerage and attention ofsunlight into thedwellings ofthe rich aswell poor, not only San Francisco, butall the towns ofCalifornia, will pre sent alower death rate than anycity intheworld\" (State Board ofHealth, First Biennial Report... 1870 and Logan was meant byalow rate: itiswell established bysanitarians that eleven deaths annually inevery one thousand 1jiving population areun avoidable, but that any excess over this inhealthy countries ispreventable. . . .cities are more unhealthy, but even for these, seventeen per one thousand isdeemed thevery extreme ofnecessary mortality. day asafair standard ofhealth; whilst under twenty isdeemed very healthy, and over thirty decidedly unhealthy (State Board ofHealth, First Biennial Report... 1870 and 1871: 59).5 Thecalculation ofmortality figures for San Francisco was clearly directed towards theideal number. For example, Henry Gibbons, Jr. Variously stated thefigure for 1871 as19.6 using census population,76 TABLE FIVE: SAN FRANCISCO MORTALITY COMPARED TOOTHER CITIES, 1870 and 1872 1870 CITIES U.S. CENSUS 1870 RAW MORTALITY MORTALITY RATE (per 1,000) St. Louis 312,963 6,670 21.3 San Francisco 299, Philadelphia 657, 179 16,750 25.5 Baltimore 267,599 7,262 27. 1 New York 927,436 27,175 29.3 New Orleans 184,688 6,942 37.6 SOURCE: Adapted from State Board ofHealth ofCalifornia, First Biennial Report For the Years 1870 and 1871: 58). 1872 CITIES DEATH RATE CITIES DEATH RATE San Francisco 17 Liverpool 27 St. Louis 20 Leeds 27 Cincinnati 20 G1asgow 28 Baltimore 25 Manchester 28 Philadelphia 26 Dublin 29 Chicago 27 Leghorn 30 Brooklyn 28 Venice 30 Boston 30 Milan 30 New Orleans 30 Vienna 31 Newark 31 Genoa 31 Halifax 31 Stockholm 31 New York 32 Nice 31 Savannah 36 Havre 31 Montreal 37 Rotterdam 31 Memphis 46 Berlin 32 Valparaiso 66 Bolonna (sic) 32 Zurich 13 .35Geneva 19 Oren Ce 35 Basle 20 ROme 36 London 21 Prague 41 Paris 21 Munich 41Cadiz 44 SOURCE: Adapted from State Board ofHealth ofCalifornia, Second Bi ennial Report For the Years 1871, 1872 and 1873: 42 .77 17.1 using Langley's figure, and 16.9 using amean figure from 1871 and 1872. Still 1ater hereported arate variations inthe death rate continued through the decade, with Gibbons more and more favoring calculations from thecity directory rather than thefeder alcensus (which, ofcourse, had been taken in1870). Logan's rates differed from Gibbons' depending onhis choice ofpopulation source. The fact that heused fiscal years and Gibbons calendar years only made matter SWOrS e. Comparisons toother cities demonstrated SanFrancisco's excellent reputation forhealth. Thomas Logan reported adeath rate for thecity of17based onaLangley population estimate, that compared favorably torates of42American and European cities (Table Five). Only Zurich had alower rate (13), and most ofthecities demonstrated death rates inthe20's and30's. San Francisco was thehealthiest city. That these figures were undoubtedly extremely unreliable for most cities and that comparability was probably very poor did not besmirch the city's reputation. Nonetheless, Logan remained vigilant inthe cause health, and would notlet SanFrancisco rest onherlaurels: \"Let usnottrust too much toourhealthful Summer breezes, but with clean streets and well drained houses, 1et uscontinue tomaintain our position asthehealthiest city\" (State Board Report... 1871, 1873: 43). \"Were ItNot For The Chinese\" By1875 the high rate ofdisease among the Chinese residents of San Francisco worried Henry Gibbons, Jr. Thestatistics forthis78 \"alien\" population were damaging thereputation ofthecity asawhole. for the popula tions, asdid Thomas Logan (Gibbons 1875: 437; State Board ofHealth, Third Biennial Report... 1874 and 1875 :37). Gibbons commented onthe 1875 death rate of19: \"As isalways thecase... were itnot for the Chinese, our death rate would bestill further reduced, amounting to eighteen and ahalf per thousand in1875, the Chinese rate being over twenty-seven per thousand\" (Gibbons 1876: 393). San Francisco health officials used the Chinese asscapegoats for most epidemics andill health during the 1870s. Asweshall see inChapter Five, anti-Chinese sentiment was strongly expressed byDr. J.L.Meares, the Health Officer who succeeded Gibbons separate tables ofChinese statistics. In1880-81 Meares accepted the new federal census figure forcalculation ofanoverall mortality rate of18.27 from the previous low of14.8.

Thus the new, lower 1880 federal census figures onSanFrancisco's population threw allmortality calculations oftheprevious decade into severe question. Dr. Meares said taken by79 ourpopulation estimated years. This over estimating thepopulation ofcities, whether intentionally orunintentionally, much ted that population figures were deliberately exaggerated topresent a favorable death rate. The new Permanent Secretary ofthe State Board ofHealth, Dr. F.W. Hatch, stated definitively that thefederal census showed previous esti mates oftotal population tobeinerror.' Hatch said that headopted thecensus enumeration, but hewas sure that itwas inaccurate. When theenumeration was taken many people were at\"watering places\" or mountain \"sanitary resorts\" and were not counted (State Board ofHealth, Sixth Annual Report. ...1880: 6). Thus thefederal census missed not only the\"disreputable\" people mentioned byHenry Langley in1871 (see Chapter One) but thewell-to-do who escaped thecity during the summer months. These physicians must not beblamed for theunreliability of their mortality figures. Intheir efforts toput thebest light onthematter for aslong aspossible. There were good arguments fortheir assumption ofahigher city population than that re ported bythefederal census. Thelatter was notoriously incomplete, andlocal estimators were more aware ofthecity's population fluctua tions. The fact that ahealthy mortality rate had been semi-officially set at17per thousand was apowerful influence. Itwas important today whether ornot. new was not asun healthy assome oftheold, densely-populated cities ofEurope and theeastern United States. Innone ofthese places however, could people effectively deal with the chief cause ofhigh death rates, theinfectious diseases. Zymotic and Miasmatic Disease Prevalence Examination ofthespecific causes ofdeaths inSan Francisco demonstrates that certain infectious diseases were blamed for failures inthecity's reputation asmuch aswere the Chinese andfaulty sewage disposal. The State Board ofHealth and the City Health Officer both kept records onspecific diseases, according tosystems ofnosology they felt tobeuseful. They calculated limited statistical comparisons from them. Their efforts were hampered again bythevery poor reliability of thereports onwhich their figures were based. For example, infant mortality rates could not becaluculated ata11 because there were no statistics onnumbers ofbirths (S. Reports. . figures used, Ithink tofollow their own model and rely onsimple percentages oftotal deaths. Henry Gibbons, Jr. devised anosology ofdisease inwhich the class ofZymotic Diseases included three orders:81. 1.Miasmatic typhoid fever, typhus fever, Scarlet fever, diarrhea, croup, created four other classes ofdisease: A.Constitutional Diseases: including cancer and consumption (tuber culosis) epilepsy, and brain and organ diseases C.Developmental Diseases: including premature birth, puerperal fever, old age, andnutritional diseases D.Violent Deaths.

The exclusion of tuberculosis (consumption, phthisis) from the zymotic disease class is significant because itwas amajor cause ofdeath inthecity. Itwas regarded character\u2014 istics ofthose inthe zymotic category. Tuberculosis alone killed between 11and 17per cent ofthose who died each year. Again, efforts were made toshow that these rates compared favorably toother cities (Table Six). For example, 22.6 per cent of SanFrancisco's deaths in1873 were attributed tozymotic diseases, com\u2014 32.3 inNewOrleans, 31.0 percent inBoston, 26.6 per cent inBirmingham, England, and only 18.8 per cent inPhiladelphia. SanFrancisco's constitutional disease rates, including tuberculosis, tended tobehigher than those inother cities. Henry Gibbons, Jr. commented onsuch comparisons in1874 that \"at the very outset aserious classification presents itself, inthe want ofcorrectness (S. F. Municipal Reports... 1873-74: 359). Graph Twoillustrates the key infectious disease killers for each year between 1869 and 1877. Consumption showed highest percentages of total deaths, except during thediphtheria epidemic of1877.

The theme ofSanFrancisco's salubrity appeared indis- cussion ofdeaths byspecific diseases observed the ups and downs inspecific disease rates, heattempted to provide explanations, whether itwas because ofthe poor sewer system, changes intheweather, thepresence ofthe Chinese, orofthetubercular. Henry Gibbons, Jr. was clearly concerned with presenting San Francisco as ahealthy city. Tothis end, hepointedly stressed the epidemic nature ofsuch diseases asmeasles, scarlet fever, smallpox, whooping cough, etc. Otherwise, heviewed each year asextraordinarily healthy. For example, about 1874 hecomments, \"But for theprevalence ofscarlatina inepidemic form, which isnow ing, ofthemortality must have been remarkable\" (Gibbons 1875: 437). Hereiterated this argument for 1875, saying that he87 doubted ifany large city inthe world had asgood amortality record asSanFrancisco. Only scarlatina had been epidemic there over thepast five years, while many cities had hadother epidemics (Gibbons 1876: 393). Inhis own mind, Gibbons apparently kept deaths from infectious diseases separate from thetotal. Perhaps heregarded them asaberrant because most ofthese deaths bytheforeign-born and bychildren. Henoted that nearly aquarter ofthe smallpox deaths in 1876 were among children under agefive, who had probably not been vacci nated (Gibbons 1877: 401). When J.L.Meares replaced Gibbons asHealth Officer there was a return toamuch greater orientation topublic health and sanitary solutions. Hereported \"asad record ofdeaths from diseases which for the most part arepreventable\". Meares argued about thediph byfilth orwhether the germs arising from some un known cause are propagated and fed byit. Allauthorities agree asto the depressing influence ofbad drainage, other theory (see Chapter Six). Healso blamed the Chinese population for disease prevalence, aswehave seen. But his own statistics show that theChinese did not contribute heavily tothecity's death rate from infectious diseases. Statistics onthis population were sopoor that thevast majority oftheir deaths each were assigned \"unascertained causes\". Asmuch aseighty per cent oftheir deaths in some years were without known cause. Itcould not bedemonstrated that the Chinese contributed great numbers todeaths from zymotic diseases.That they tended tobesettled assingle men without families may mean that they actually suffered fewer ofthese deaths. Infectious diseases usually killed children. Somehow the fact that Chinese died asadults appeared significant toJ.L.Meares. Hestressed that nearly athird ofthedeaths among other nationalities were under age five, while only 35\"Mongolians\" ofthis age died in1880-81. Adults were held respon sible for causing their own deaths and were blamed for immorality or carelessness. But childhood mortality was regarded asunavoidable (see Chapter Five) (S. F.Municipal Reports... 1879-80: 414; 1880-81: 251). Summary Chapter Four During decade ofthe 1870s efforts were initiated todocument thehealth ofSanFrancisco's population. Health officials immediately recognized the severe limitations oftheir statistics. Poor reporting ofdeaths, confusion indiagnosis and indisease nosology, and theweak ness ofoverall population figures produced very unreliable mortality statistics. Nonetheless these health officials reported death and disease rates each year andconsistently presented San Francisco asone ofthehealth iest cities inthe world, onsuch statistics. They toa 17/1,000 death rate asahealthful extreme. They attempted tokeep San Francisco's atornear this level, even ifitmeant manipulating overall population atrisk figures. Other cities rarely reported amortality rate aslow asSanFrancisco's. Comparability ofsuch city figures must have been extremely poor, but comparisons did much toassure thepublic that San Francisco was the healthiest ofcities. Health officials tried toidentify theaberrant elements orcauses80 inthepopulation that sent rates above thehealthy level. The Chinese were regarded asone such source ofincreased disease prevalence and were condemned forit, inspite of1jittle real evidence. Another blamed source ofhigh mortality rates was thecity's faulty sewage system. Although only afewinfectious diseases (e.g., cholera and typhoid fever) canactually have derived from contaminated water, this concern followed quite logically from accepted etiological beliefs. Athird source ofincreased mortality rates was thepresence of many sufferers oftuberculosis inSan Francisco. This disease was not considered toshare thefeatures ofthe zymotic (infectious) disease class. Rather, itwas seen asaconstitutional, inherited condition. It accounted for thehighest percentages oftotal deaths each year among thediseases wecall infectious today. Health officials strongly urged that consumptive patients beremoved from city facilities toastate hos pital elsewhere.

Deaths ofchildren under five accounted for between 31.8 per cent and 40.1 per cent ofall deaths during theyears 1867 to1881 inSan Fran- cisco. Those under age one accounted for between 18.3 per cent and 24.4 per cent ofall deaths. These percentages represent avery high child mortality rate bytoday's standards.\" But they aredifficult toassess without information inthecity population. For example, in1867 and 1869 children under age five accounted for 38.7 per cent and 40.1 per cent ofall deaths, respectively. In1869 small pox raged; but inneither year could there have been avery large popu lation ofchildren inthecity, since women still composed much less than half thepopulation. Large numbers ofthechildren who were inthecity must have died during this epidemic. ThePacific Medical and Surgical Journal produced ashort butsig nificant editorial in1877, rationalizing high infant mortality figures: That one-half the deaths inagiven place should beamong children under ten years ofage, isstartling tothepop ular sense and often elicits from the laws of1jife and death. Nodoubt the mortality among infants might bevery much diminished everywhere, bysurrounding them with better circumstances. But those better circumstances belong rather toaUtopian condition ofsociety than tohumanity with its current errors andvices; and wemay expect adifferent state of things when the millennium shall commence, and not sooner.

Clearly these children died from infectious diseases. Ahigh death rate among them, asamong foreign immigrants, was accepted asanecessary evil, given human frailty. The victim (oratleast the victim's family) was blamed forliving conditions andhabits that pro duced disease. Thepercentages ofdeaths under age ten ranged between 33.8 per cent and 48.4 per cent during the decade (see Table Seven). Thus the above quotation implied that thecity was infact very healthful forthat age group. Child mortality did notusually even approach fifty per cent oftotal deaths, except during the smallpox anddiphtheria epidemics. The Health Officer reported that infant mortality ofthesalubrity ofourcity. however, that, \"Of course wecan make nopositive comparisons with these places unless we know theproportion ofchildren bythe simple absence ofchildren inthis youthful, male city. Gibbons suggested again in1874 that ifitweren't for epidemics child mortality would remain ataninevitable, healthful level. Another interesting belief isrevealed inGibbons' analysis ofthegreater female than male deaths from certain zymotic diseases. Hesaid, \"This may be95 partially explained when itisrecollected that thevast majority of deaths from zymotic diseases occurs among young children\" (Gibbons 1875: 438). Hemay have meant either that there were more female than male children, orthat female children were more susceptible todisease (Gibbons 1875: 438; State Board ofHealth, Third Biennial Report. ..1874 and 1875: 42-43). The annual San Francisco Municipal Reports show that children under age five accounted for about half the zymotic disease deaths each year. But thesignificance ofdeaths ofsmall children received 1ittle attention indiscussions as amat ter ofcourse, atleast byhealth authorities. However, aneffort to see these children were began bythe end ofthedecade. Itwassus pected that they were thechildren ofimmigrants, anditwas known that they were not Chinese. J.L.Meares' staff prepared statistics showing that ofthetotal 1644 deaths of\"minors\" in1879-80 759 (46.2%) were children offoreign parents and another 11.6 per cent had mixed parentage (S. F.Municipal Reports... 1879-80: 461). Henry Gibbons, Jr. was also concerned that thechildren of foreign-born parents were not identified assuch because they were born inthe United States. Heattempted touse the San Francisco school cen- sus toindicate their proportion ofthepopulation. Hefound that 40,056 children under age 17had foreign parents, 12,230 had native parents, and 5,956 had mixed parentage. children oftheforeign born inexcess inall ourcities and towns, especially San Francisco\". Considering similar figures, Thomas Logan agreed that \"This issimply another proof ofthegreat preponderance oftheforeign element\" (State Biennial Report... 1874 and 1875: 36, 43).96 Much asboth men claimed that thecity's child mortality rate was normal, they clearly wished toblame itontheimmigrant, not thenative population. \"The Laboring Classes\": Foreign-Born Mortality inSanFrancisco The greater mortality among foreign than native born inSan Francisco received frequent notice inhealth statistics. In1873 Henry Gibbons, 1872-73: 343). Most ofthese deaths occurred inprivate andpublic institutions, and among them theIrish and Chinese were prominent. Gibbons commented that \"In very fewcities dosomany avail themselves ofevery decedents inthevarious dying inhospitals were foreigners: \"showing what class patronize these institutions. Letitbe understood, however, that about one third ofthe deaths occurred inthe private hospitals... and hence are notcharity patients\" (State Board of Health, Third Biennial Report... 1874 and 1875: 43). Remembering that during this period almost half ofSanFrancisco's residents were foreign-born, and that four out offive had parents who were, andIssel 1981: 29). Butitisworthwhile and Irish deaths reported inmortality statistics.97 Oftotal registered deaths, those occurring ininstitutions always accounted for agreater percentage than those from specific wards ofthecity. This percentage ranged from 17.7 per cent in1870 to19.6 per cent in1877. Theinstitutions from which statistics were collected were the City and County Hospital, U.S.Marine Hospital, French Hospital, German Hospital, Italian Hospital, St. Mary's Hospital, St.Luke's Hospi tal, Small-Pox Hospital, Almshouse, and also collected bywards ofthecity. Later inthechapter Ishall look more closely atstatistics from certain wards, and from the City and County Hospital. Deaths were categorized asCaucasian (orwhite), Mongolian (or copper oryellow), andAfrican (orblack) and Indian races through the decade. Butstatistics onrace ofdecedents were not very meaningful since itisknown that reports onChinese deaths were extremely inaccurate, and Blacks and Indians were only avery small percentage ofthepopula tion. Between 1867 and 1881 Caucasians accounted for between 86.3 per cent and 92.6 per cent oftotal deaths; Chinese for between 5.8 per cent and 12.8 per cent; and Blacks and Indians for between 0per cent and 1.7 per cent (see S. F. Municipal Reports). Between 1873 and 1877 the white foreign-born population accounted for between 31.4 per cent and 36.1 per cent oftotal deaths (see Table Eight). The Irish-born accounted for between 12.1 per cent and 15.3 per cent ofall deaths between 1867 and 1880. German-born came next, account ing for 5.5 per cent to7.8 per cent ofdeaths. These twopopulations comprised approximately 13per cent and 9per cent total, spectively.

But heargues that health statistics should berelated totheentire Irish community, including first, second, third, and fourth generations.

Itappears that Irish were over-represented inmortality sult Burchell also and sexstructure ofthe community must beconsidered. We doknow that the Irish community included more women, and presumably more children, than other groups did(Burchell 1980: 148-150). Examination consistently re veals that thehighest percentages ofdeaths during the 1870s were from100 wards ten and eleven, both highly populated byIrish. There was contemporary recognition oftheextent towhich Irish appeared inhealth way oflife. the rugged 11feofthe home country tothecomfortable life ofSan Francisco, rather than poor living conditions inthecity, tended to produce this disease (Gibbons 1875: 241-242). Healso believed that theIrish demonstrated aproneness tophthisis, perhaps because they drank too much. Unlike anearlier belief that whiskey might beprophy 1actic forthis disease, Gibbons said that itobviously was not (see PMSJ Feb. 1875, 45: 423). The Chinese population ofSan Francisco incurred thegreatest amount ofvillification anddiscrimination. They composed one tonine per cent ofthepopulation between 1850 and 1880. Bynativity, they accounted for between 5.7 per cent and 11.7 per cent oftotal deaths during the 1870s, byrace between 5.8 per cent and 12.8 per cent (see S.F.Municipal Re ports). They were blamed, among other things, for thepresence ofvar ious diseases, principally tuberculosis and 1eprosy. The reasons for thisanti-chinese attitude andits consequences have been sothoroughly examined elsewhere that Health Officers theChinese during the 1870s. In1870 C.M.Bates stated that \"they are not only amoral buttheir Reports... 1869-1870:101 233). Bates excluded the Chinese when comparing mortality rates ofSan Francisco toother cities because they \"pay noregard tohygiene andsan itary laws; and not only that, but from prejudice, and not speaking or understanding our language, they fail, when attacked with disease, to avail themselves ofproper care andmedical treatment\" (S.

The cause ofmost deaths wards' deaths were attributed tozymotic diseases. Thelargest percentages Cccurred during the epidemics mentioned above. These were diseases that affected children, and these were the wards inwhich children lived. For example, in1869-70 virtually all thedeaths from thescarlet fever epi <iemic inthese wards were among children under the age often, while 89 Per cent ofthephthisis deaths were older than twenty. Ninety-two per cent ofscarlet fever deaths in1872-73 were under ten andeighty-eight Per cent ofphthisis deaths were over twenty. Similar figures occurred fordiphtheria (S. F.Municipal Reports). That these victims were also foreign-born isdemonstrated byMuni Gipal Reports figures.

Nonetheless, examination ofthese *Surces isrevealing. People often either did not know, ordid notcare about the diagnoses ofdiseases.

Similarly, ayoung man in good society who had trouble securing apermanent jobsuffered from chronic cyspepsia andbiliousness. Itseems not tohave occurred tohim that his Problem might have resulted from diet. Inhis diary andletters nine illness episodes oftwenty-six mentioned about himself and hisacquaintances referred tothis condition, which also led to\"colic\" and\"gripes and diarrhea\" (Howe 1869-1874).

Rather people identified with the romanticized illnesses ofthe famous. Thetragic lives ofstage actors were exemplary, asare those and TVperformers today. Asociety woman recalled Adelaide Neilson, anactress who died one year after hersuccessful appearance in SanFrancisco in1877. Her leading man, Henry Montague, also died the following year ofahemorrhage atSanFrancisco's Palace Hotel. Another actress who played inthecity, Fanny \"died before ofconsumption onherlast visit, but few ofher audience could have guessed it, she played still with somuch verve ....Herinsistence onplaying was not tobeovercome. ...Actors do seem tohave a courage peculiar totheir calling. Georgie Drew Barrymore played with sparkle andlightness long after her health was broken. She died ofconsumption in Santa Barbara (Neville 1932: 228). Still another actress inSan Francisco, Clara Morris, was severely ill: \"Word ofher increasing illness and theterrible remedies employed (hot irons onher spine) heralded her coming every season.

Just as17per 1,000114 was regarded asahealthy mortality rate, fifty per cent ofdeaths under age ten was also quite acceptable according tohealthy ideology ofthe time. That San Francisco rarely approached this percentage and other cities exceeded itwasindicative ofthecity's healthfulness. Itis hard toknow what these childhood mortality figures really meant because wehave noestimate ofthe population atrisk. Most children died ofinfectious diseases each year, accounting forabout fifty per cent oftheannual zymotic disease deaths. Bythe endof the decade efforts were made toconfirm thesuspicion that the victims were children offoreign immigrants ofdeaths experienced bytheforeign-born corresponded centage ofcity population. But many children born ofimmigrant Parents were classified asnative-born because they were born inCalifor nia. Thus theactual mortality rate among these families washigher than statistics offoreign-born deaths indicate. TheIrish-born tended tobe oftuberculosis, zymotic diseases, andleprosy. Inreality Chinese health statistics were extremely unreliable and they Were not permitted tousecity health facilities. Other foreign-born used the City and County Hospital and died there. About three-fourths ofpatients were foreign-born and nearly as *y died inthehospital year. They died primarily oftuberculosis, P*monia, typhoid fever andheart disease. They were admitted tothe most often with syphilis, other venereal diseases, rheumatism andtuberculosis. Most people died athome. They were usually lower class children and *nfants succumbing toscarlet fever, smallpox, diphtheria, and other115 epidemic diseases. Such children were rarely ifever hospitalized. The immigrant wards south ofMarket Street demonstrated highest death rates during thedecade, children dying ofvarious infectious diseases andyoung adults oftuberculosis. The less dramatic illnesses suffered bypeople ingeneral during this period included colds, catarrh, sore throats, dyspepsia, diarrhea, andheadaches, common ailments today aswell. Many middle and upper class children suffered \"childhood diseases\" such asmeasles, mumps, Scarlet fever, diphtheria, and whooping cough without dying from them. Onecan conclude only that better diet andliving conditions provided them with greater resistance than lower class children had. For, aswe shall see inParts Two and Three, neither theregular medical profession noralternatives offered effective therapies for these diseases. Death was nostranger even tothebetter classes per cent (State ofCalifornia Pepartment ofHealth Services 1979-80: 215). 22. Gibbons usually excluded deaths from foundling asylums from these figures. *1were infants ofCalifornia birth, but many were children ofimmigrants. There was anextremely high death rate inthese institutions because of *dequate substitutes formother's milk. Bythe end ofthe decade this list increased totwenty-five institutions, *luding jails, orphan asylums, homes for theelderly, and various116 additional hospitals and asylums. \"At least with regard tosmallpox, Germans were seen asmore susceptible than Irish early inthe decade. Germans had twice themortality as Irish from this disease, inspite ofthegreater percentage ofIrish, in both SanFrancisco and New York. Itwasbelieved too, that Germans were more likely tohave been vaccinated (PMSJ Sept. 1869, 28: 175).117 PART TWO NOBLE WORK\": REGULAR MEDICAL PROFESSION CHAPTER SIX: \"REGULAR, IRREGULAR AND DEFECTIVE\" The decade ofthe 1870s was aformative period for the\"regular\" use ofthe terms \"regular\" and\"irregular\" todistinguish members oftheestablishment from alternative practitioners symbolizes thetransition was taking place. Itwas atime when professions ingeneral inAmerica were more specifically defining themselves. They were laying down ground rules or codes ofethics, requiring certain evidences oflegitimacy such as college degrees, professional certifications, memberships insocieties. Ineffect, they were creating \"cultures\" over the years hasestablished thethoughts, habits, and responses most modern Americans have taken forgranted\" (Bledstein 1976: 81). The ferment inSanFrancisco's medical world over two decades isagood example ofaprofession's struggle todefine itself, toarrange its power structure, and togain legitimate authority over the community. Bledstein asserts that this effort was well under way by 185 Ointhemedical profession. InSan Francisco the process was delayed *til the 1870s because ofitslater settlement and theunstable nature ofthe community. One can say that bythen \"the status ofthestruggling medical profession, itsability tocontrol its berecog *ized asthe only legitimate authority bythe '1ay' public, issue\" will beseen inchapters118 to come asIdiscuss alternative practitioners and the ways inwhich regular physicians reacted tothem. First, however, thecharacter of this profession inthe decade 1870s must bedrawn. Asmany as1,500 physicians had come toCalifornia the Gold numbers were decimated bydisease The andpractice approaches became available asthecity grew (Saunders 1967: 309-310). Medical training ofdoctors atthis time mornths ofacademic training and assist consisted of\"reading with a doctor\" and\"riding with adoctor\". Asgraduation from medical schools bec ame licensing ofthose who hadserved only anapprentice shi-P wasrequired bymany states. But themedical schools were *slially proprietary, meaning that they operated tomake aprofit. They Were competitive; andstandards forgraduation might consequently below. \u00b0eurse work involved two four-month terms repeating the same material, a firmal exam and apreceptorship ofseveral years. Bythe 1870s many medi Sal schools provided clinical training indispensaries. Some were associ *ted with teaching hospitals. In1871 Harvard introduced athree year $*rriculum, and other major schools slowly followed this model (Rothstein 1972 sBrieger 1982; ofmedical education the t\u00ba was poor atbest and varied greatly with the source oftraining, E'**'s Dean orAmerican. Many hadlittle ornotraining atall.119 This lack medical education made itall the more urgent for theregular profession todefine itself, for medical profession continued to stabilize and 1egitimize itself asthe community itself did. Control Over medical competitors became amore central issue astime went on, so that atthereinstitution ofthe San Francisco Medical Society in 1868, the following statement was made: Doctors may beclassified asHugh Murray has classed the verbs ofour language into regular, irregular and defective. The regulars are those who have respected the custom bydevoting years tothe study ofmedicine and have submitted tosuch proper tests oftheir abil ity, asdue regard for the common good... isrendered obligatory. ...Theirregulars are such ashaving studied medicine, and perhaps graduated with honors, have be come solost toevery sense ofprofessional propriety, astoproclaim themselves champions ofsome exclusive idea. . ..Such individuals use thetitle of'Doctor' to secure the confidence ofintelligent and honest people, whilst they prove recreant tothe moral obligations they are under ... .The defective are those who never had any claim torecognition bytheprofession. .. .They offer 1958: 39). Ever, then was atendency athree part classification: regular 'Pre Fessional), irregular (popular), anddefective (folk). Listings inthecity's business directories indicate thesuccess of the regular medical profession. In1871 there were four columns of *>sicians 1isted, most ofthem regulars. There were also forty other *Pee ific alternative practitioners, including naturalists, botanic *>sicians, Chinese physicians, electro-magnetic physicians, spiritual **sicians, water cure physicians, and homeopathic physicians. There We*=also 1istings for female physicians, midwives, nurses anddentists.120 In1876 there were fifty-two ofthevarious alternatives and five But in1879 alternative practices nolonger existed inthecity. Their legitimacy had simply been sufficiently damaged tokeep them out ofthecity directory. Details onalternative practitioners will bediscussed inParts Three and Four. Various medical societies rose andfell inthe decades prior to the 1870s, such asthe San Francisco Pathological Society, the San Francisco Medical Society reorganized in1853, and the San Francisco Medico-Chirurgical Association. TheCalifornia State Medical Society was instituted and survived. There was also aGerman-Jewish Medical Society inSanFrancisco. Thesocieties that failed fought over the establishment offee schedules and definitions of who was and was not a legitimate practitioner (Harris 1932: 122-125; Read andMathes 1958: 2- In1868 athird Version ofthe Medical Society had been initiated. The **me year theSacramento Society forMedical Improvement was begun under Pr-F. and Dr.J.G.Tyrrell. These twosocieties survived (Harris 1932: 127). Thecity directory lists seven medical societies in ls75 including dental, pharmaceutical, homeopathic, eclectic andregular. In1870 theCalifornia State Board ofHealth had been established with Thomas M.Logan asPermanent Secretary and Henry Gibbons, Sr. asPresi c Lent - The board concerned itself with the\"salubrity ofpublic insti tut +tions\", with issues asprostitution, crime and drunkenness. Besides thecollection ofstatistics, there waslittle attention given to infectious diseases (Harris 1932: 165, 169). This State Board of Health was only the second inthenation. Meanwhile aSan Francisco Board ofHealth wasinitiated. Itconsisted offour into apower fulpolitical tool ofthe medical profession. Two medical schools had been established inSan Francisco: the Medical Department oftheUniversity ofthePacific begun byElias S. and the 1982). Therelationship between these schools was complicated and much conflict was generated bytheir rivalry. Theinternal squabbling ofSanFrancisco's regular profession illustrates Bledstein's contention that professionalization \"to The indivdualism of18th-century America had tobetamed and brought into controlling institutions as19th-century society industrialized.

This aspect of professional culture resonates today 1976: 85; Starr 1982). \"The San Francisco physicians stressed thedifficulty oftheir work and their poor remuneration. In1870 the California Medical Gazette commented that 110physicians' names had disappeared from theoriginal 249listed inthecity directory five years before, and that 123 new names had appeared.

The schools also ran twodispensaries for the poor inwhich physicians practiced andprepared medicines without charge.

Regular practitioners regarded their profession inthe 1870s Medicine was seen asacumulative, nondogmatic much asthey dotoday. science, distinguished through theages bygreat men and works. The medical Code ofEthics laid restrictions onmembership inmedical associations. Italso defined theobligations ofdoctors topatients and vice versa. Patients were obliged bythe code not toseek other medical opinions once under the care ofaregular physician. Infact the code recommended that aphysician \"ought not totake charge of. .. apatient who has been recently under the care ofanother member of the faculty, inthe same illness\" (Hatch 1873: 96-108).

AsStarr puts it,social interests began tobedefined inaway that conformed totheinterests of the regular profession (see also Ehrenreich andEnglish 1978). Janzen (1978) has observed this process cross-culturally andhistorically (in Zaire). Following Weber, hesays that \"Growing incorporation within a Sector ofthe medical system always rests onauthority received from the (Janzen 1978: 127).126 initiated atthis time remains afolk model ofdisease. Itsscientific explanations address the same socially dis- ruptive conditions that any folk model must discharge. Thescientific model contains theclassificatory features ofafolk model; itpresents supernatural, mechanistic, empirical, natural, emotional andpsychologi calfeatures. Most physicians commonly negotiate with their patients somewhere between astrict biomedical explanation and popular beliefs; sothat their \"operational\" model isaculturally defined tothe popular and folk alternatives tobedescribed inParts Three and Four. The regular profession was competing desperately with other sorts ofhealing during the1870s. Asthey endeavored toestablish prerogative over Scientific explanation, physicians reiterated their superiority over Patent medicines, \"quackery\", andother alternatives (see Chapter Twelve). The fight against these competitors was regarded asahigh and noble *esponsibility. AsDr. R.W.Murphy asked, wehave aprinciple todefend, as . . . there aregreat andqualified men inourprofession who will move inthis noble work with untiring127 zeal and energy, and never cease until thelight ofmedical science shall penetrate the gloom and darkness that envelope thepeople (Murphy 1874: 595-596). Itwas necessary inthis struggle for the physician tomaintain hischarisma. Hemust have ascientific image, keeping upwith character (Hammond 1879: 212-217; The decade ofthe 1870s was atime inwhich the regular medical community was working toachieve hegemony over thecity's health care and toestablish themselves asthe only legitimate health care pro viders. This effort wasdifficult inpart because ofthe poor medical training even members ofthe regular profession had received. From the outset medical societies were formed inSan Francisco whose chief purpose was toexclude irregulars or\"quacks\". During this decade lasting medical organizations were established inthecity andstate. Several medical schools were also begun in San Francisco embodying rivalries that were todominate theprofession. The practice ofmedicine was notparticularly lucrative atthis time, and there was much competition forpatients. Regular physicians regard\u2014 edtheir profession \u00a9fethics andtheir patients' behavior. Medical practice Was mystified tomake people regard itanditspractitioners with re Spect and awe.

The Code ofEthics ideology ofscience was accepted atthe popular level that people turned away from alternative practitioners. Both regular physicians andalternative healers used charismatic authority andmystification oftheir therapeutic actions toattract patients. The regular profession was not atall secure initscon over thepublic.

Once this faith was gained the regular profession hadachieved thecultural authority that sustains ittoday.

For centuries Galenic medicine gave continuing authority tomiasmatic theory. Itsvital feature, the that onedisease could give rise toanother, orthat different diseases could arise from asingle source.

There were many etiological interpretations proposed and believed during the19th-century; variations onthemiasmatic theory aswell as other proposals. George Rosen's (1958) three-part isa useful starting point. Itishowever, anideal-type, heuristic classi\u2014 inbeliefs: 1.The Miasmatic orAnti-Contagionist Theory held that infectious diseases (i.e., diseases) were caused byatmospheric con settings. Disease was tobelocally caused, notcontagious. This view was adopted bysuch *enowned members ofthepublic health movement asEdwin Chadwick, Rudolf Virchow and Southwood Smith. The theory was formulated inAmerica byNoah in1799. diseased people andtheir belongings (\"fomites\"),132 caused infectious diseases. Well-known British advocates ofthis position were William Budd and John Snow. Contagionists promoted isolation ofpatients andquarantine because they believed the\"direct 3.The Theory ofContingent Contagionism was acompromise position that held that infectious diseases were contagious, but only inconjunction with other conditions such asstate ofthe atmosphere, condition ofthe soil, orsocial factors. This theory because itwas so flexible.\" Itwas adopted bythe English public health reformers, John Simon and William Farr, and the German Max vonPettenkofer. The latter's belief that cholera became virulent only incertain thedistinction between contagionist andanti-contagionist theories. Heargued that the twopositions were closely allied, both being based onunreliable observations, little experimental method, reasoning by analogy, and nounderstanding oftheconcepts ofcarrier orvector. He Said theactual choice between made forpolitical reasons. Anti-contagionism coincided with therise ofpolitical liberal ism among reformers andindustrialists. They felt thequarantines dic tated bycontagionist theory were \"the itch\" theorists. Conventions had abandoned the idea ofquarantines infavor ofsanitary approaches before theCivil War (National Quarantine and Sanitary Conventions 1977). Inhersophisticated analysis of19th-century medical ideas, Margaret political tation ofadherency oranother. She objected also tohis dichotomy that allcontagionist theories evolved into germ theory, and that all miasmatic theories were anti-contagionist. She argued that all theories were undergoing change, including fungoid, animalcular, and fermentation ideas (Pelling 1978: 299-310). The three major forces interacting inany ofthese etiological schemes were atmospheric conditions, local miasms, and contagion from thedisease.\" Aswelook atrepresentative ideas among physicians comment isappropriate: \"All this confusion oftheory andcounter-theory was not diminished in any way bytheinadequate terminology used atthe time\" (Richmond 1954b : 294). Thegreat epidemiological studies and Europe *tthis time took place inacontext ofchanging orientations. The \u00b0ld, formal andabstract philosophical approach todisease theory was replaced byempirical observation and experimental documentation. It isironic that achief complaint against germ theory among San Francisco Physicians was that itwas\"closet speculation\" not confirmed bythe134 empirical evidence oftheir clinical experience. American culture stressed practical results, notscientific research. Only about one inseven physicians accepted germ theory in the 1860s, according toCharles Rosenberg (Rosenberg 1978b: 265-266), But 1897 (Rosen 1958: 313-314). Most ofthese developments took among German pathologists. Many laymen and laypublications inAmerica, such asPopular Science Monthly , accepted the theory before professionals did. After Koch demonstrated thetuberculosis bacillus in1882 however, germ theory became afad in America. Bacteriological causes were announced for many non-bacterial diseases (Richmond 1954a). Butthis history goes beyond our time in San Francisco. Exhalation\": not theUnited States, andcertainly notCalifornia. Generally, American medical journals reported little ofthediscussions occurring overseas. Conse quently, the miasmatic theory remained entrenched. This conservatism was theresult ofpoor communication from foreign sources, and oflack ofprofessional organization among American physicians. Most physicians' time was occupied bythedaily trials oftheir clinical work. But by themid-1860s there Rosenberg a\"kaleidoscope ofetiological Etiological models were \"shifting schemes\", including beliefs about heredity, habit, and environment. Because there was solittle certainty inetiological thought, immoral behavior was often blamed forcausing135 disease, especially among the\"lower\" andimmigrant classes (Rosenberg 1967; beemulated today insomewhat altered They ex amined constitutional, environmental andlife circumstances ascausa tive factors.

Medical journals inSan Francisco inthe 1870s reflected what appeared elsewhere intheUnited States. Aspectrum ofproposals and theories appeared intheir pages during the decade aswriters tried to sort their own empirical evidence from speculative thought transmitted from Europe. Aconflict was often expressed between experience and theory, the American doctors tending torely onthe former andreluctant toaccept new ideas. Bythe end ofthe decade ideas about thebacterial origin ofinfectious diseases were more common, butstill far from being accepted (Richmond 1954a). medical press summarized the views ofMax von Pettenkofer onthe necessary 176). The 1870s were not toadvance etiological thought considerably beyond this point; but the 1880s revolutionized it. Ihave found examples ofeach ofRosen's types Francisco medical journals ofthe tobeable tothink about contemporary medical ideology itisnecessary toapply some ordering principle. Ofgreater significance however, were the repeated assertions and attempts tojustify varying and overlapping etiological theories without scientific methodology. Physicians' emphasis on empiricism regular profession was togain and retain medical jurisdiction. Contagionists Those who believed indisease contagion were inthedefinite minority. Ihave found only one real instance published late inthe 1860s. The California Medical Gazette compared the current imagine, that any one now denies that these diseases are of amost infectious nature --that some thing iscommunicated from thesick tothehealthy; but when weask agerm Medical Gazette Nov. 1868: 109-112).137 There was actually considerable doubt about this belief. Some con tagionists were \"animalculists\", that is, they were able toassimilate germ theory into their understanding ofdisease. Many others believed that what was contagious was apoison orchemical (Richmond 1954b; 290). When California physicians spoke of\"zymotic\" diseases they did not accept William Farr's concept of\"asubstance orspecific ferment for each disease\" that lived inthe body but waslifeless outside it. They referred rather tomiasmatic poisons (Richmond 1954a: 436; 1978: 84). Contingent Contagionism Probably the best local were caused neither byfungi nor germs, but that they could be contagious.

Where Kunkler's theory differed from his miasmatic colleagues was inhis statement that zymotic diseases could become contagious when these ferments were \"exuded from theskin orlungs\". Interestingly, he also \"the carcass ofonesingle rat\" might become thesource ofcommunicable chief medical journal, Sr., wasrepresentative istposition toanti-germ theory the time came. J.Campbell Shorb, wrote a it,\" was produced byboth environmental and man-made conditions. Certain physical laws produced changes ontheearth's surface which favored disease; and new immigrants cleared the land, dammed rivers, and brought about other changes that produced putrefied, standing water. Shorb distinguished types ofmiasmatic diseases tobefound inforests, plains, mountains, orcities, suggesting that these environments were sodifferent that the \"germ\" ofthedisease must travel from asingle source 1872: itinteracted differently in different patients. Inthis idea Shorb was observing correctly the nature ofmalaria's conformity tothelife cycle oftheparasite. Symp toms will differ depending long thepatient has and what itusually occurred in10w-lying areas ofSan Francisco associated with standing water and poor drainage. But hehad also observed it\"on one 'aresult inourcity,' poor hygiene (Shorb 1872: 395). That ideas preceding bacteriological theory were already present inmedical thought isindicated byhis vivid139 description ofa10cal the water. when theghastly pestilence, rising like adestroying Genius from theputrid waters, might stalk abroad, hurling defiance inthe face ofmedicine, bringing death anddesolation to innumerable homes (Shorb 393). with in1874, Dr. of Oroville, north ofSan Francisco, for amiasmatic cause. He referred fever. Heremained mystified about why disease occurred inthe same place and under the same conditions one year and not thenext. But hedisagreed that \"filth\" and smells were thecause. Rather, hefelt that ofOrovi11e plain with andirrigation indeadly vapors (Miller 1874: 393-395). Thus Miller identified arural source for malaria. Aneditorial inSan Francisco that year debated the source ofdis\u2014 ease in\"filth\". Itreported that aPhiladelphia journal argued that use ofopen cesspools and not water closets and sewers was ahealthier approach. Cesspools contained only animal, and notvegetable matter, and only themixture ofthe two was seen asfatal. Poisonous vapors also concentrated near homes using sewers because they were notventila ted. The San Francisco editor commented that \"no words ofours are needed tocall upexamples where asudden puff oradiffusing stream of140 vapor rising has produced most serious illness\" (PMSJ 1874 XVI(3): 137-138). Apparently contradicting this position three years later, the same journal argued that diphtheria did notarise from \"foul emana tions from drains, sewers, water closets\". Because itattacked \"the cleanliest dwellings, where hygienic laws were strictly enforced\", and also appeared inrural areas, this explanation was notpossible. But none other constitution oftheatmosphere\". Specific references tothis idea were still being made inSan Francisco late in the 1870s. For example, in1876 and 1877 theprevalence ofvarious infectious diseases created concern. ThePacific Medical and Surgical Journal voiced general anxiety and bewilderment, butsaid, \"There has prevailed for six months orlonger, throughout agreat portion ofthe North American Continent, anunusual tendency infectious, and malignant orpernicious diseases. . Dismissing other explanations, theeditor remarked, \"Weare by nomeans satisfied with the popular doctrines onthesubject, and prefer toconfess our ignorance ofthecausation ofmost diseases which are placed head of'Zymotic\"\" (PMSJ 1876 XIX(7): 324).

They re oftheoriginal thevictims succumbing all tothe same local influence\" (Gibbons 106). Anti-Contagionism Specifically anti-contagionist statements appeared inassociation with miasmatic theory from the beginning ofthe 1870s. Referring to aproposed European conference onscarlet Pacific Medical andSurgical said that more good istobeaccomplished byadopting measures ofgeneral than byefforts directed bycontagion\" (PMSJ Dec. 1869 No. 31: 329). Theeditor, Henry Gibbons, Sr., was aligning himself with thesanitary reformers and against those who advo cated quarantine and other measures ofisolation. The same journal argued against thebelief that phthisis (tuberculosis) was communicable in1872. Nurses who were constantly around such patients did not get thedisease. Family members who became tubercular did sobecause they142 had weakened constitutions and were exposed to\"the foul diseased that contagionist andanti contagionist views were really very close. The yellow fever epidemic inother parts ofthe country inthe late 1870s aroused concern inthe San Francisco press.\" The contagion istinterpretation ofthis disease was condemned inSan Francisco in 1877 and 1878. The fact that northern cities were free ofthe epidemic wasattributed toits being local inorigin and avoidable where scrupu lous sanitary precautions were taken. The disease devastated thesouthern states, adistinct expression ofdread appeared inthe daily fever's cause, staunch anti-contagionist position: \"As ageneral rule, writers who have had theleast personal experience adopt the idea ofcontagion most read ily; while practical men, who have seen, and handled, and become famil iar with whatever disease isinquestion, are more analysts regarded itasimported (and consequently responsive toquaran tine), but those share theanti-contagionist view of yellow fever. AMrs. Hare and her four children were quarantined away from San Francisco in1878. The eldest daughter died ofthedisease while onanemigrant train from Memphis tothat city. Railroad officials decided toquarantine the family and another woman intheir car, hoping the cold nights would kill thecontagion (San Francisco Chronicle Sept. 7,1878: p. 1, c.1). In1880 ameeting ofthe San Francisco Medical Society brought together the three etiological perspectives that were onstage when germ theory made its memorable entrance. Ironically, thephysicians did not even react tothereal purport ofthe paper they discussed, butexpress edinstead their traditional biases. The paper, byDr. W. H.Mays, argued that alldiseases resulted from human communication ofliving germs. Most oftheeleven doctors who commented supported thetheory that various diseases mayarise from asingle source (miasmatic theory). Intheir personal experiences they had observed erysipelas and puer- peral fever communicate into each other (the transmutation ofdiseases), andscarlatina, diphtheria anderysipelas derive from asingle source. Three doctors rejected this unity oforigin theory. Dr. Gibbons, the most ascerbic critic ofcontagionist and germ theory inthepast, adopt edamoderate position atthis time. Hesaid that some infectious dis- eases arose denovo and that germ theory was possible. But hefelt the germs might arise outside the human body.

Hementioned such things days, uncomfortable dress and\"self abuse\" (Griggs 1873: 582-587). Both moralistic and genetic theories ofdisease were expressed in 1874 byO.M.Wozencroft.

Although ittook many years for germ theory tobeaccepted inthe United States, the idea dated asfar back astheinvention ofthemicroscope. Many 18th-century European scientists found the idea ofmicroscopic in sects orworms abetter explanation for the transmission ofdisease than prevailing theories. Few proponents ofthe idea surfaced inthe United States however. Cotton Mather was anearly advocate inthe 1720s, but aside from Daniel Drake, fewothers wrote oftheanimalcular theory there until thelate 19th-century. The reason forits slow acceptance was inpart because disease taxonomy was soconfused. Disease entities were not clearly identified, much less associated with specific causes. The anti-contagionist position further blocked thenotion ofgerms inthe United States and Great Britain. These countries developed successful sanitary reform programs partly because ofthelack ofinterest inspeci fic germs orcontagion.

In1873 the same journal again questioned that germs seen bymicroscope inmilk led totyphoid fever. Again they wondered why the cows were apparently unaffected (PMSJ 1873 VII(6): 294). The editors argued against germ theory again in1878 and cited various supporting studies. In1879 they declared the \"germ theory indoubt\" because another medical journal reported afungus yellow fever (PMSJ 1878 published anironic piece Soon there will 1eft for ustoeat ordrink We shudder tothink ofthe myriads oforganisms which enter the breath ofair.

But Nineteenth Century had argued late in1879 that themicroscope proved the presence of disease organisms intyphoid fever. The medical press inSan Francisco commented in\"The Germ Theory onStilts\" that \"The germ theory isnow under fire, and looks like losing ground rather than gaining it\". Germ theory 332). The150 article contended that contagion took place through the passage of minute solid particles through theair and into the lungs. Several months after rejecting it, the San Francisco editor, Henry Gibbons, Sr., apparently accepted the theory and began todebate its advocates on their own ground. Hewas astonished that thearticle proposed that the particles were irregularly scattered intheair, \"like flies Rather, heargued, there were thousands ofspecific germs intheair. Only an innate immunity prevented those present from becoming ill (PMSJ 1880 XXII (9): 422-424). Just twoyears earlier Gibbons hehadagainst contagionism, that itwas microscopic germs, ismore apt todevelop thedoctrine ofcontagion than inthe theater ofpractice\" (PMSJ 1878 XXI(4): 179). Henry Gibbons, Sr., in his early seventies, isakey informant inthat heepitomized American medical thought during this period, conservative intheory aswell as practice. But by1880 hewasreluctantly considering bacterian theory israpidly being disproved and abandoned, and the theory that these diseases have each adistinct living germ still lacks that confirmation which will induce thethinking, practical physician toadopt it\" (Snider 1880: 249). For example, S.Hittell151 reconfirmed that malaria originated inachill. He rejected in1880 thereport oftwo European doctors that beliefs that were typical ofAmerican medical thought ofthe time were expressed inSan Francisco inthe 1870s. The oldmias matic theory predominated, with its accompanying anti-contagionist position. Infectious diseases (then called \"miasmatic\" or\"zymotic\"), both rural and urban, were believed toderive from local sources of decaying animal orvegetable matter. Disease was created from resulting miasms joining an\"epidemic constitution\" intheatmosphere. Some San \"contingent contagionist\" position, be Francisco physicians adopted a lieving that the miasms were potent only when certain other environ mental orclimatic conditions, orbodily predispositions were present. Fewer physicians adopted astrict contagionist theory that some poison ous character ofdisease could bedirectly transmitted from person to person, orthrough affected belongings. The term \"germ\" was frequently used inthese writings, butits meaning was vague and did not guaranteed bytherelative effectiveness ofsanitary reform measures. diseases was infact affected for the better. Thevariety ofetiological theories present during this decade reflected adynamic period inscientific thought and therapeutic152 approaches. Beliefs inpredisposing immorality leading todisease produced accusations from upper andmiddle classes and some physicians that immigrants and the poor were responsible forinfectious disease epidemics. Itwas notuntil the end ofthe century that physicians andscientists, laboring under thetraditional philosophical approach todisease theory, recognized what people ingeneral hadempirically observed; i.e., the communicability ofinfectious diseases. Itis ironic that advocates ofmiasmatic theory inSan Francisco insisted that their empirical observations were more reliable than the\"closet speculation\" ofexperimental science. Physicians andtheir patients were obviously making different observations since the doctors could find noevidence ofcommunicability and lay people could. Although the idea insects orgerms filled theintellectual atmosphere ofthe 1ate 1870s, San Francisco physicians accepted them. Asinthe case oftheanti-con tagionist position, the feeling was that this theory derived from scien tific experimentation, not from practical, on-the-job observation. By1880 leading medical men ofthecity were having toconsider bacterial theory more seriously. They were still inclined toreject it.

The atmospheric theory stated that the atmosphere iscorrupted by diseased persons andtheir fomites. The chemical position ofJohn Snow was that disease discharges communicated poisons. The miasmatic theory was that contagion occurs when these discharges decompose (von Pettenkofer). Under theinfluence ofJustus Liebig's chemical experiments, William Farr proposed his zymotic theory. This argument defined aferment or \"zyme\" specific toeach disease that reproduced itself asaliving organ ism inthe body. The term \"zymotic\" was used inAmerica for what wenow call infectious diseases, butFarr's theory adopted (Richmond 1954b; 296-298; Eyler Foretiological centuries, see Winslow (1943). Such concepts could becompared toetiological classifications established byethnomedical studies ofother were seen ascontributory. Fear might beregarded asapredisposing factor. This idea should becompared to modern anthropological studies ofsusto (see Rubel 1977). *Shorb between as\"the pestilential exhalation\" arising from \"the stagnation or vegetable matter inastate ofdecomposition;\" andmalaria asthe more specific term referring to\"poisonous matters... defective154 drains, choked sewers, foul fuzziness ofthese distinctions is typical.

Itisprobable that they did not mean that smells themselves were dangerous, but they were no doubt often taken literally (see Pelling 1978: andunpleasant. The toerase bad odors might cross culturally (Douglas 1966). *This \"soon there will benothing left for ustoeat\" argument is strikingly similar tocomplaints made today bythose who say that if \"everything causes cancer\" there isnopoint inavoiding food additives, be\u2014 tween medical theory andpractice ofthis period. Hepoints out that therapeutics involve more than physical manipulations. Cultural factors including personal and social characteristics ofboth physician and patient interact toproduce the context ofmedical care. The ways in which this process occurs are regulated bytraditional social rituals (e.g., see Emerson 1970). Nineteenth-century therapeutics have been described both aspart ofaprogressive evolution inmedical knowledge and astheproduct of economic market-place competition. Rosenberg notes however, that these explanations refer only tochanges inmedical ideology. They donotex plain therelationship between medical Heargues that therapeutics resulted from ametaphorical understanding ofthe human body asabalanced system. The body was continually juxtaposed between inherited constitution and environment. Anequilibrium model explained the balance inits functions which equalled health and thedisturbance which caused disease. Balance could beaffected byboth internal bodily chemistry and external factors such asmiasms and climatic change. Physicians relied onthis common cultural understanding ofhealth when they treated their patients. Natural functions ofthe body such as perspiration, urination and defecation became central signs ofboth disease and theeffectiveness oftreatment. Thephysician's equipment consisted primarily ofhisbasic sensory abilities toobserve these functions inthe absence ofmore sophisticated technology. Drugs were de157 signed toaffect these functions aswell. Thus cathartics and emetics were used inboth regular medicine and popular and folk practice. The equilibrium model ofhealth and disease was shared byregulars, irreg\u2014 ulars and lay people alike. Itwas akin tothe popular conception of wholistic health today (Chapter Nine). The public health movement was tohave greater impact oninfectious diseases than any medical therapeutics (see Chapter Three). Butitwas the rare physician who encompassed both apreventive and curative approach todisease. Most regular physicians thedetails hospital and home treatment. Itwas based on atheory ofrigorous treatment tocounteract volved bloodletting, blistering, emetics, purgatives, opiates, and meager diet. These active therapeutic measures declined inuse generally by 1860, but claimed ardent advocates inSan Francisco well into the 1880s. Some ofthe major medicines oftheheroic approach, shown tobeineffective byexperiments inthe 1860s. But few San Francisco physicians were impressed bythe experimental methods developed bytheParis Scheol. They preferred time-honored approaches (Powell 1949; Berman 1978; Duffy 1982). Patients could readily observe theeffects ofheroic medicines. They knew they were receiving treatment and were reassured, despite un pleasant side effects. Thepopularity ofcertain ingredients ofreg ular aswell this affirmation byphysiological response. Asisthe case with such dis eases ascancer today, there was nonecessary connection between etio158 logical theory and therapeutics. The imbalance ofdisease was evident from physiological symptoms, and these symptoms were treated bydrugs or bleeding toreestablish bodily equilibrium. Itwas important neither todesignate specific diseases nor disease-specific cures. Theetiological theorist and thepracticing MDhadlittle need ofeach other. Where alternative practitioners and regular physicians disagreed was onthe means ofbodily restoration. Bythe 1870s eclectics and others emphasized thenatural healing capacity ofthe body, helped by proper diet and exercise. They rejected themateria medica ofthe regulars, but nottheir understanding ofhealth and Three). Fewregulars or\"irregulars\" were ready inthe 1870s toaccept the idea ofspecific disease entities. Rather certain constitutional susceptibilities and certain environmental influences resulted in specific physiological responses. Inasense, specific diseases were not treated. Bodily imbalances were theobject oftherapy. This approach did not emphasize prevention totheextent that wholistic health advo cates dotoday. But ofthe body tosurvive inpopular conceptions ofhealth and disease. The regular practitioner nolonger shares this viewpoint, although some medical critics suggest reintroduction ofa\"systems\" view ofthe body (Engel 1977). Today regular practitioners must rely onthe charismatic authority ofmodern science topersuade their patients to comply with their advice, for they can nolonger rely onashared defi inthe ethnomedical sense. This change began among (see Chapter butits drugs were commonly experienced byanyone seeing aregular physician until late inthe 19th-century. Treatment was accepted bypatients generally because patients and physicians shared acommon conception ofhealth anddisease and the human body. Evidently these remedies \"worked\" be cause they produced significant physiological responses. As10ng as patient and physician shared this understanding ofillness these thera peutics met social expectations, andillness, treated (Young 1976: 7-8; Rosenberg With the growing change inmedical ideologies ofthe 1870s however, more people became disillusioned with heroic techniques. People sometimes expressed their opinions ofmedical care intheir letters ordiaries. For example, Helen D'Apery recalled her treatment asaschoolgirl inOakland fordiphtheria. She was weak and could scarcely eat orwalk: and then Dr. Porter was sent for, and hedosed mewell, after the generous some oftincture ofcayenne pepper.

She was extremely bitter andresentful about this outcome (D'Apery ca1852- 1872: cupping, ofthepast; but most drugs (Kaufman 1971: 110-113).\" Physicians of the 1870s stressed that they were not dogmatic. They rejected thedesig nation \"allopathic\", assigned them byhomeopaths because itimplied the exclusive use ofmedicines which produced effects opposite tothedisease symptoms. Rather, they claimed touse\"remedies according toreason and experience, availing themselves ofall The term \"allopath\" suggested that theregulars were just another medical sect. Thewell-regarded physician, Dr. Gerard G.Tyrrell, stated in1873 that hehad ceased bloodletting, purging and using opiates forinfluenza,161 using stimulants andtonics instead. Inaddition, patients were no longer kept inclosed rooms, sweating under blankets. They were given \"strong soups, albuminoids, andcarbo-hydrates\" zymotic diseases (Kunkler others continued heroic remedies. For example, in1878 aneditorial remarked that diphtheria had been cured byaphysician ofcalomel ormore hourly \"till used inthis case (PMSJ 1878 XXI(2): 75). Dr. R.H.Dalton argued that year that for some unknown reason epidemic diseases had been more intense inthepast, justifying the harsh remedies used bydoctors then: \"Fifty years ago... thepractice was totreat all Dalton used such measures only inacute illnesses. The reason physicians were becoming defensive about their therapeutic approaches was inreaction to\"Conservative medical sects which favored natural cures and botanic medicines (see Part Three). The term wasoriginated byDr. Austin Flint and meant \"conservative In1863 further use ofcalome1 andtartar emetic inthe army. This decision followed upon arguments, such asthose ofOliver Wendell Holmes and Jacob Bigelow, against mineral remedies (Brieger 1967). But \"medical nihilism\", asitwascalled, did not significantly change orientation ofsome San Francisco physicians as1ate as1880. Ittended tobepopular among sophisticated academic physicians and younger doctors (Rosenberg 1967: 244). Medical nihilism did notchallenge thegenerally shared equilibrium body, and ofhealth anddisease. Several infuential articles onConservative Medicine appeared in San Francisco. In1868 Dr. E.Malcolm Morse patients: \"Whole armies ofmen, women, and children, intyphoid and yellow fever alone, have been hurled into their graves byblood-letting, mercury, depleting cathartics, anddepriving them ofproper avoidance ofuseless andinjurious therapeutic measures\" and circumspect application ofany medicine. Im proved diet wasits most important feature, inMorse's view. Several years later Dr. A.B.Nixon read apaper onthis subject before the Sacramento Society forMedical Improvement. Itwas followed byremarks ofhiscolleagues. Because doctors believed inartificial treatment, hesaid, they were unaware that \"the life power ofthesystem ...without had been over-rated.163 Eight physicians responded toNixon's paper, but none agreed with him. Some argued that nature was merely theally ofthe doctor, who must con tinue hisministrations. Otherwise one was practicing homeopathy. Dr. Tyrrell noted that nature could work for evil aswell asgood, and must sometimes berepressed. Heand several others seized upon the proven ofGalen, the wonderful discovery ofthe value ofcinchona, iodine, bromine, cod liver oil; reject asun true the thousands ofcures attributed totheir use, adelusion?\" (PMSJ 1873 VI(12): 583). Asthe heroic and conservative medicine heated upduring the 1870s, physicians became more defensive. In1873 T.A. Snider defended bloodletting, saying that some doctors had gone toofar expecting nature tocure disease, andrejecting medicines \"asifallmedi cation however skillfully employed tonature, instead of being what itreally is,auxiliary toher healing, and only opposed to her destructive tendencies\" (Snider 1873: 158). Henry Gibbons, Sr. agreed with Snider that aprejudice against blood letting had developed. Speaking tothe graduating class ofthe Medical College ofthePacific in1878, aroused from myarm, and Ihad hooping\u2014cough, asmymother informed memany years after wards, and was more than twoyears old. ...That Isur vived theprocess isevident (Gibbons 1878b: 290).3 Gibbons argued had been abused, but not aswidely as164 itsdetractors alleged. People were commonly bled \"once ayear, onthe return ofspring, not because they were sick, but from the idea that they required itasapreservative orpreventive\". Thus thebody's equilibrium was renewed and maintained asayearly ritual. Inhis hospital practice Gibbons had resumed bleeding for the pain ofpulmonary andbronchial diseases, along with counter-irritation and blistering, use ofmercury orcalomel. Itwas the most commonly used medicine, even though mercury poisoning was afrequent iatrogenic effect. Gibbons re marked that calomel and antimony had been recklessly used, but primarily byquacks and people who overdosed themselves with patent medicines. Heregarded thecontinuing popularity ofthese medicines asevidence of their potency. Henoted that his father had used such heroic measures and had not lost ahome patient infifty years (Gibbons 1878a :301-305).\" Vaccination and Quinine The only really successful medical approaches toinfectious disease during this period were vaccination against smallpox and the use ofquinine totreat malaria. Vaccination kindled strong public resistance insome communities, leading to\"smallpox riots\" aslate as1894 among German and Polish immigrants inMilwaukee (Leavitt 1976). People feared that vaccination created and spread other diseases.\" They were joined by \"irregular\" doctors andpatent medicine manufacturers who resented com\u2014 pulsory into puncture sites\") did produce smallpox inmany cases. The inoculated person could spread thedisease because 'humanized' virus was sometimes Itwas Theskill infected scarring. Before calf lymph (containing cowpox) became available in1870, the method ofvaccination also spread syphilis, erysipelas and other There was somuch variety intype ofvaccine matter andability ofvaccinators that the outcome evidence that people resisted vaccination inSan Francisco. Itwas very much promoted during the smallpox epidemics of themid-19th-century. Richard Stanwood, who lived northeast ofthecity, reported tohissister the problems ingetting daughter. vaccination isnot going totake\". Hecommented inJanuary 1880 that she had been vaccinated again, and wrote hissister ofhis new awareness of the controversy about it: istaking this time 'for surely' as you ever read any ofthe against vaccination? The opponents figure upanincrease incon sumption, scrofula, and other old diseases, ofanumber ofnew ones, asdirectly attributable toit, soastoquite shake ones faith inits being the blessing tohumanity wehad supposed. Some distinguished physician inGermany, where vaccination was compulsory, advised hisclients her that \"Bessie's arm was so sore for afew days that wehad it, butithas healed very nicely now\" (Stanwood 1852-1884: 2/3/1880). This may have been an effect Mrs. Margaret Pierce wrote hersister inMay 1876: hard, Mollie only looked herreproaches\" (Pierce 1869-1888: 5/1/1876). During the smallpox epidemic that year Lucy Pownall wrote from SanFran cisco toher mother that she had been vaccinated atthe direction ofher father, while they visited her aunt inthecity. She commented that \"My arm isquite sore but Idonot mind it\". She was not achild atthe time, for shemarried three years later (Pownall 9/13/1876). Poorer people were regularly vaccinated atpublic dispensaries atthis time. During the 1868 epidemic aneditorial berated theinefficiency of public vaccinations, saying that the whole city should have been vaccina ted during thefirst month (California Medical Gazette Nov. 1868: 112). In1879, over tenyears later, Henry Gibbons, Sr., asPresident ofthe State Board ofHealth, again stressed the need for compulsory vaccination against smallpox, onthe European model (Gibbons 1879a: 89). Smallpox, asother diseases, was associated with immigrants. In1869 aneditorial speculated that Germans and Irish were more susceptible to the disease (PMSJ 1869 No. 28: 175). Chinatown was blamed asthe source for the smallpox epidemic of1875-76, presumably inpart because the Chinese were unvaccinated. The main reason was because they were alien (Trauner 1978: 73). The use ofquinine against malaria was bark) kills Plasmodium intheperipheral bloodstream, thus tempo rarily controlling thedisease.

Standard doses ofquinine were about one-third what isaccepted today (20-30 grains daily now), but too small tobevery useful. Still, quinine tends toretard the development ofimmunity tothedisease, so receiving only small doses may have helped some people (Ackerknecht 1945: 126; Smith 1976: 354). ofthe 1820s malarial fevers were treated with Peru vian bark. were always toprotect theliver andspleen 1878b: 292-293).

Later inthecen tury such hospitals retained this function onthe grounds oflarger general hospitals. Poor people, who were the usual patients, often hid from the authorities inorder toavoid going toapest house. They knew they were quite 1ikely todie there. Removal also separated them from their families and made eviction from their houses orloss oftheir jobs possible. Itwas known that \"patients were peremptorily managed byunderpaid, frightened and callous nurses. Such hospitals found itdifficult to attract and hold staff andSairey that examinations took place inpublic places. Treatment wasoften actually conducted bystudents.

Even today with new emphasis ontreating \"the whole person,\" doc tors rarely seetheir bearing ondisease ortherapy. InSan Francisco these conditions were typical. During the 1868 smallpox epidemic victims were required togotothe smallpox hospital. The City Health Officer atthe time stated that hedid not expect people who could betreated athome (i.e., the upper classes) tocomply. Public outcry during this epidemic brought attention toconditions inSan Francisco hospitals (California Medical Gazette 1868 I:37-40; 1958: 45).\" Aneditorial inthemedical press said isno reason should not have ahospital that would becom\u2014 fortable forpatients, and atleast not areproach and disgrace and wealth ofthecity\" (California Medical Gazette 1869 I:133).

Apest house had existed inSanFrancisco with every epidemic, be ginning with ashanty during the 1850 cholera epidemic.

But the Secretary and Attending Physician and Surgeon disputed each ofthese criticisms.

There were also societies forother special groups such asreligious groups, orphans, mechanics, clerks, women, veterans, and deaf and dumb. There were 63 Protective Societies listed that year, mostly based onoccupation, and probably functioning asbanks andinsurance companies. Bythe end ofthe decade there were and Swedish (Langly 1871, 1878; TheStranger's Guide... 1875; Stern 1973). The French and German hospitals supported bybenevolent societies survive tothis day, asdoSt. Lukes and St.Mary's, originally staffed byIrish Sisters ofMercy. Other groups during the 1870s included the West Indian Benevolent Society and the Six Chinese Companies. All these groups were set uptoprovide aid during illness later, Chinese patients were own community, but did not have ahospital proved bythe marked ofcases ofextreme poverty andsuffering, from the community. ...sothat to-day there should not beasingle worthy person suffering that the key word here is\"worthy\". Those poor who were not treated byprivate doctors orinhospitals also had the option ofattending one oftheclinics ordispensaries con ducted bythecity's medical schools. Before the 1870s clinics were run \"in acompletely incidental and haphazard manner asthe need arose orin173 accordance with the whims ofindividuals\". The City Hospital provided prescriptions to1,000 outside patients amonth. The City Health Office provided medicines totheill, and some private physicians developed free clinics. Inaddition most oftheother hospitals and benevolent organizations provided free care (Read and Mathes 1958: 66). Charles Rosenberg (1974) reports that dispensaries ineastern cities atthis time usually had aresident physician and anapothecary aswell as aconsulting staff from city medical establishments. They were pri vately endowed and usually hadlittle money. InSan Francisco the medi\u2014 cal school dispensaries were open three orfour days aweek. Thecity supplied medicine thephysicians nolonger contributed tothese clinics. About 300-400 private physicians then provided approximately $100 amonth each infree services (Read and Mathes 1958: 80). The primary function ofdispensaries was tovaccinate and toprovide prescriptions. They treated the\"worthy\" poor initially, those who did not end upinpublic institutions. Asimmigration increased theclientele became increasingly foreign and more and more destitute. Rosenberg notes that the almost exclusive drug therapy conducted bydispensaries contrasted therapeutics inprivate practice. The middle class patient received more attentive treatment andappropriate regimen adjustments; but \"The city poor could not well vary their diet, take uphorse-back riding, visit the seaside, orvoyage tothe West Indies\" (Rosenberg 1974: 36). Private physicians inSanFrancisco often suggested such approaches totheir patients (see Chapter Fourteen). The establishment ofdispensaries was motivated inseveral ways.174 Itwas ahumanitarian andChristian responsibility tocare for the less fortunate. Caring for them was also ameans ofprotecting higher classes from contagion. Most important however, was thefunction ofdispensaries asteaching hospitals, providing clinical training and theprestige associated with that background (Rosenberg 1974: 38-41). The twomedical schools inSanFrancisco established dispensaries because neither had hospital affiliations when they began. Intheearly years physicians could control the type ofpatient seen indispensaries; i.e., the \"worthy poor\". These honest poor could thus bekept from poorhouses and public hospitals. Bythe 1850s and the 1870s inSan Francisco theclientele fordispensaries changed with the immigrants. They nolonger appeared tobe\"deserving poor\" todispensary physicians. Physicians found themselves faced with people who spoke foreign languages, followed different customs, andresisted treatment.\" Many who worked indispensaries became aware that the drugs they were dispensing were not the answer tothehealth problems oftheir patients. Fundamental changes were needed inliving conditions ofurban immigrants. Physicians could not escape their 19th-century context how ever, andinterpreted these problems inmoral terms. Nor could they hide their feelings ofdistaste and contempt for the truly alien, destitute anddiseased people they served (Griscom 1970, orig. pub. 1845; Smith 1973, orig. pub. 1911; Brieger 1977, 1978). Moral judgments about theorigin of disease 1ed tofatal criticisms ofthe dispensary system. Itwas regard edasanunnecessary charity, nolonger aiding thedeserving poor, but the unworthy. Rosenberg (1974) concludes that thefall ofthedispensary sys tem inthe20th-century reflected to analytically associate their etiological beliefs andtheir therapeutic practice. Practice was based onacommonly accepted equilibrium model ofthe human body. Regular physicians, alternative practitioners and thegeneral public alike regarded disease asadisruption ofthebody's natural balance that might arise from either internal orexternal causes. Thejustification forharsh \"heroic\" medicines such asmercury and practices asbloodletting was evident. People could observe imme diate physiological responses that were believed tocounteract the disturbance ofdisease. Physicians did not have diagnostic tools other than their basic senses, sothe focus was onobservable bodily changes. Drugs were used that produced such changes. Therapeutic pro cedures addressed ashared cultural definition ofillness, sowhether or not disease was reinforced. . Intime thesocial definition ofeffective therapeutics began to change, although theequilibrium model ofthe body remained undisturbed. Conservative medicine and other alternative approaches began tostress milder treatments with more attention topreventive and hygienic measures. San Francisco physicians remained adamantly infavor oftheolder, heroic approaches until well past the 1870s. Their only really effective efforts were vaccination against smallpox and the use ofquinine intreatment of malaria. Inspite ofphysicians' identification with science, both of these successful measures had been discovered bychance, notexperimenta tion. Theregular profession involved themselves intherapeutics that176 inhospitals, dispensaries and other institutions which treat edthe poor and immigrant classes. But they could notcontrol theten dency for people ofall classes todoctor themselves ortousealterna tive practitioners. Because ofthis competition, physicians allied themselves with traditional, time-tested therapeutics and ridiculed other members oftheir profession and other healers who believed inallowing nature totake its course. Butpatients tended tochoose methods that seemed effective andleast unpleasant, atleast until regular physicians could depend onthecultural authority ofscience towards the end of the century. Until then there waslittle security inthemedical profession. Itisnotsurprising that the miasmatic, anti-contagionist, anti-germ theory, pro-heroic medicine ideology epitomized byDr. Henry Sr., was strongly defended inthe face ofchanges andchallenges onallsides. Tension inthe was respon sive toahigh level ofsocial change. The city was rapidly experiencing 19th-century growth, urbanization andindustrialization. Accompanying economic stress could notrely ononly theregular especially tobeshunted todis pensaries andpublic institutions forlargely custodial care. *Doris Muscatine (1975) has noted that \"the pioneer Anchor Drug Company inNorth Beach stocked leeches until thelate 1950's, and shrinks from employing po tential remedies whenever there are good grounds forbelieving that diseases will pursue afavorable course without active interference.

This belief survives aspart ofthehealth ofAmericans today, either explicitly orimplicitly experience cross-culturally todivide illnesses into those naturally orsupernaturally ofanillness may also bedistinguished from itsultimate cause. Thus anultimate supernatural causation may act through amore mundane earthly cause. This operation issometimes thought ofas the \"why\" and \"how\" ofdisease. Itisnot unusual tofind germs asan immediate etiological explanation (how) associated with witchcraft orsome other supernatural cause (why). Cross-cultural etiological explanations share with early 19th-century Western medicine arecognition ofmulti causality inthis contagion could both beresponsible fordis- ease. They accounted for both ultimate explanation and immediate etiolo gical cause. People inthe19th-century were could not figure outscientifically the mode oftrans in1849 poor, who were itschief victims, understandably began toreject thedivine justice explanation. Middle and upper class people continued toregard the causes ofcholera as amoral issue. They held immigrants and the poor responsible for living conditions that spread contagion. Itwas believed that only the poor died from resulting diseases. Evidence supported this point ofview. For example, more than 40per cent ofthe\"dying\" inNew York that year were Irish-born. In1866 public health reformers persisted inbe\u2014 1ieving inpredisposing immorality andsloth. The issue had subtly changed from areligious vsscientific controversy into class conflict (Rosenberg 1962).\" Prior tothe 1870s domestic health manuals taught people that they had some control over thepresence ofhealth ordisease intheir lives. Good health systems ofthe body. Ifthis equilibrium was maintained byattention tohygienic rules, sickness was avoided. Attention todiet, cleanliness, rest and bowel regularity was emphasized. Thenatural corollary tothis viewpoint was that disease resulted from transgression ofthese natural \"laws\" of the body. Disobedience tohygiene practices was equivalent tosin and \"would certainly bring down wrath inthe form ofbadhealth\". Judgment might not come from God, butitdid come from Nature, asuitably super natural authority tomotivate people tocurb excessive behavior. Disease was the punishment for immoderation (Fellman and Fellman 1981: 28, 33-35, 43-45). People were not toblame disease onProvidence, when in fact disregard forhygienic matters was responsible. The Family Health182 Annual published inOakland, blamed were with anoverwhelming number ofunassimilated The victim was blamed. The immoral way oflife ofthese people was regarded asresponsible for thedisturbance ofnatural equilibrium that was causing disease. Until conformity tosocial expectations was achieved bythese newcomers their behavior would beregarded andtheir illnesses assupernatur ally sanctioned. Thus theincreasing heterogeneity and urban life, in creasing competition forjobs, and ageneral sense ofdeteriorating social life resulted inpeople beginning toblame others, not themselves, for transgressing natural health laws. Inner mental andphysical control became more and more necessary inthe face ofthis outer chaos. But illness was now seen asmore than apersonal responsibility. External conditions could create it; andothers' lack ofpersonal control could be blamed. The newcomers were diseased and 1jved insqualor andsocial corruption. They transgressed natural law and spread their transgressions and punishment through contagion. While physicians found germ theory difficult toaccept, people ingeneral found that itsuited admirably183 their changing perceptions. People could now blame germs fordisease and their spread onthe same folks who were creating social disruption in general incontagion ofinfectious diseases was common atthepopular level inthe19th-century. Professional physicians were often scornful ofthis belief. Butpatent medicine manufacturers were more attuned to popular views. For example, William Radam patented his pink liquid \"Microbe Killer\" in1886. This medicine killed all germs. Hisetiologi\u2014 cal explanation was aconvenient amalgam ofmiasmatic and evidence ofpeople's belief incon tagion. example, Newmark often mentioned inherauto biography herbeliefs about theetiology ofthevarious diseases she and her family experienced.

When she returned toSacramento after seeing him, she took off184 all herclothes toair them inthe yard because, bad. theother ofthechildren took diphtheria and even myJoe was not immune. What fear andfright Isuffered 1The strangest thing was that this disease 1880s her son again came down with diphtheria. This time Mrs. Newmark expressed amiasmatic etiological idea. Shesaid, One day mydear Milton was coming home from school and the ground was dug up. Hehadleft home quite well and when hereturned atnoon, hecomplained .itwas bythe exhalations from underground, where mydear son had passed. ...When Iexpressed myfear tomydear Millie that she might become infected, she would notlisten; God hadprotected her (Newmark 1900: 14). The doctor shecalled inmay have provided Mrs. Newmark with the miasmatic explanation. She continued tofear contagion from thedisease. She also belief inultimate causation bycalling onGod's protection. Theartist Mary friend about fear ofcontagion in1868: Mysister Bessie has been ill for along time ofscarlet fever--so very ill, that for afew days wehad almost forgotten that there was aworld outside ofher sickroom. Then came theanxiety lest the trouble should spread, and the members ofthe family who had been exposed fall vic tims tothe disease. Wespent two weary weeks ofsus pense, until atlast when nonew cases appeared and the Dr. said that all further precautions were unnecessary, wecould breathe freely (Foote 1868-1915: 9/16/1868). Mrs. Margaret Pierce expressed asimilar fear in1881 when her two children had scarlet fever. Friends and her aunt had not visited be cause they feared getting the disease themselves ortransmitting itto other children. Another friend came tosee her, 12/14/1881).185 Temperaments, Humors, Heat and Cold Some general health beliefs were shared bypeople ingeneral and their physicians inthe19th-century. The rather fatalistic herited temperaments orconstitutions was one such idea. Asbeliefs in divine punishment for wrongdoing became more secularized, they were re placed bynotions oftheinheritance ofacquired characteristics. Thus any excessive behavior might bepassed tounborn children. This in herited constitution possessed anaccompanying disease susceptibility. Thus immorality continued toreceive appropriate retribution inthe form ofdisease (Rosenberg types were healthy but had apredisposition toheart andartery diseases. They were morally weak Thebilious hadover-active livers. and tohave gout, rheumatism, apoplexy, cholera, cancer, tuberculosis, and other infections. The nervous types were most susceptible toillness, such asemotional illnesses, liver problems, indigestion, neuralgia, epilepsy and insomnia (Haller 1981: 3,18-21). These beliefs were held bymedical professionals and laypeople. Life insurance companies asked aperson's temperament ontheir application forms. Physicians diagnosed andprescribed onthis basis. Asmedicine became more sophisticated, physicians began touse the term diathesis toindicate susceptibility toacertain disease, and temperament tosug186 gest the whole physiology oftheperson. Clearly the predominance ofsuch ideas lent itself tosocial con- structions ofdisease. Attitudes towards people ofcertain racial and national backgrounds derived naturally from thenotion ofinherited constitutions andsusceptibilities, andcontributed todeveloping social attitudes about (Haller 1981: 3,16-18). When the Pacific Medical andSurgical Journal printed articles associating certain ethnic groups with certain diseases itwas expressing the common con- ception ofinherited predispositions. Thus Germans might bemore likely toget smallpox, and the Chinese tohave leprosy. TheIrish to atleast reluctant toattribute illness directly todivine retribution, the idea ofinherited disease suscepti regarded Efforts could bemade both individually and onasocietal level toovercome this destiny. Thus both personal hygiene and moral behavior and public health, andsanitation efforts were needed (Rosenberg 1976: 25-53). With thebeginning ofthe20th-century these ideas had coalesced into racist andeugenicist forms, especially directed atthe \"new\" immigrants from southern Europe andatBlacks. Today beliefs intemperament andconstitution have been attenuated187 toepidemiological associations between sex, andsusceptibility constructions ofdisease heredity along environmental and psychological causation. Thediseases attributed tothese causes often overlap (multifactorial causation) and may not correspond tobiomedical classifications. For example, women interviewed inScotland recently regarded some infectious diseases assubject toheredity orinherent susceptibilities oras resulting from environmental exposures and poverty. The very ancient belief inbodily humors still exists insome American communities today and was certainly part ofthe folk health beliefs ofthe19th-century. The four humors: blood, phlegm, black and yellow bile, each arose from certain parts ofthe body and were related toheat and cold, wetness and dryness (Snow 1974: 88-89; Foster 1979; Blaxter 1983). Thehot/cold theory ofdisease has been common through history and around the world. Recent research inGreat Britain reveals such beliefs still among theolder population. Hot and cold conditions are further broken down into wet and dry. Chills and cold are produced environmental 1y; but the heat offevers isattributed tocontagion, togerms, and thus tosocial relationships (Helman 1978). Similar beliefs were present in both professional and popular 19th-century disease ideologies. They were based, asare many medical beliefs, onatheory ofopposites. Much of heroic therapy reflected ideas ofopposition, anotion homeopathy directly contradicted. The heroic approach ofbleeding afeverish patient derived from the idea that this would relieve over-heated blood (Foster 1979). In1878 and 1879 the San Francisco medical press reported that cold water treatments for fevers were unsuccessful. InGermany this therapy had been188 used for typhoid fever: Fever being heat, and thetemperature ofthe blood being elevated several degrees, physiological medicine dictated external cold, andquinia internally, astheproper apyretics. But the cold water hasalready run out, and the German physicians, who were loudest initspraise, have ceased sectarian approach todisease treatment as well. Inpopular ideology thehot/cold theory states that thenormally warm body ismade vulnerable toattacks ofcold. Thus susceptibility occurs especially after eating, bathing, exercising, sleeping and during menstruation, all ofwhich warm the body. Some ofthe folk reme dies tobediscussed inthis chapter reflect these beliefs. For example, barley water cools the blood and mustard plasters extract cold from the chest (Helman 1978; Foster 1979). Europeans who migrated tothe United States may have had good reasons fortheir belief inhot/cold theory. Liniments and other temporary applications ofheat briefly warmed people who lived incold countries ininadequately heated orunheated dwellings (Smith 1979: 303, 339). Hot/cold theory remains quite common inLatin America today (Snow 1974: 89-92; Foster 1979). Afinal very important popular health belief was again shared by 19th-century physicians (Chapter Eight). Itwas the idea ofavoiding disequilibrium orimbalance orany expression ofextremes. This idea was propounded inpopular home health manuals. For example, intemperance, eating too much, dancing too much, sleeping toolate, exercising toolit tle, might all lead todisease (Jones 1967: 259). Similar ideas exist in America today, and also form a1arge part ofnewwholistic health approaches. Excess ofvarious kinds weakens the body and makes itsusceptible todis189 ease sooner orlater (Snow 1974: 87). Those who catered topopular health beliefs, the purveyors ofpatent medicines, made imbalances central to their sales pitches. Popular Health Beliefs inSan Francisco Inher amusing account oflife inSan Francisco inthe 1870s, Harriet Lane Levy explained was amisdemeanor, astigma tobedefended And anemia, whisked away toacountry farm. .. .Aman wanted asound wife, Mother said, and itwas well that health should announce itself inahigh color and afull figure (Levy 1975: 72,orig. pub. 218, orig. pub, 1937). Even today the features that people ingeneral use todefine dis eases are seldom those chosen byscientists andphysicians (unless people adopt professional nosologies). The illnesses\" arestressed rather than definitions ofetiological andphysio logical features. People are concerned with the why and how ofillness and with itsimplications -its level ofseriousness orcurability. Then these considerations ofinheritability, age-relatedness, andpsychological effects (D'Andrade 1976: 159). In another illness episodes areinterpreted bythesick through pragmatic \"everyday thinking\" andphysicians engage in\"systematizing thinking\" bywhich190 they bring the episode into coherence with their premises and assumptions (Young 1976: 9-10). Toreally understand the impact ofdiseases about itmust beexamined 179). For achieved by looking atletters anddiaries. Examination ofcontemporary San Francisco manuscripts yields ex amples ofhealth beliefs mentioned. For instance, Mrs. Margaret Cameron Pierce was abeliever inthehot/cold theory. Shesuffered all herlife from amalady which was never properly diagnosed. She had chronic sore throats and heart pains andpalpitations. As ayoung woman in1868 she once treated her headache and drenching inthe rain with awarm foot-bath, acold head-bath and going tobed (Pierce 1868: 3/13). asan adult she attributed her illness tothe reaction ofher thin blood tocold weather. \"got cold\" getting upatnight with asick child and became ill herself asthe result. Mrs. Pierce worried that her husband would besick with diarrhea because ofhot weather (Pierce 1869-1888: there was however, that itwas unusual for thechildren not tohave acquired immunity, since they had had thedisease before (Newmark 1900: 13). Beliefs inbodily equilibrium and thenecessity ofmoderation to maintain are SanFranciscans ation, inthe overeating and sexual overindulgence inevitably led todisease. Even the unnatural rhythms ofcity life, with artificial lighting atnight, might encourage immoderate habits (Fellman and Fellman 1981: 31-33, The idea that extremes are deleterious tohealth reflected anawareness that social change was producing stress. Competition inbusiness and the freedom ofchoice ofAmerican life produced ambiguity andanxiety, which inturn encouraged behavioral extremes. The morally wholesome position was one ofmoderation inall things, including class level. Alocal physician produced abook in1867 that discussed indetail thirteen causes ofdebility that predisposed people todisease. These causes were imperfect nourishment, impure air, excessive exertion of body and mind, want ofsleep, want ofexercise, long-continued heat, long continued cold, spirit drinking andhabitual intoxication, depression or grief, excessive emotion, defective cleanliness, defective ventilation, and diseased orimproper food. Healso discussed theseriously defective drainage and sewage removal inSan Francisco. Heremarked that resulting diseases were notclass-specific: InSan Francisco the lodging-houses are crowded, and Iam frequently nearly stifled onentering one where there are anumber sleeping together, and unless great supervision takes place insome ofthese places, fever (where least expected) will break out initsworst form --namely, ofa low, typhoid character; and that, andvegetable will bring adevas tating plague, not confined only toour poorer classes, but reaching those parties who imagine that byliving in the suburbs they will escape theinfection, and therefore interest themselves butlittle inthis question. They must not, however, forget that they come into town tobusi ness, and that they may bestricken perhaps attheir count ing houses, orthe contagion may seize upon their clothes, and they can take itinto the bosoms oftheir families, and thus strike down thelittle ones who come clinging to them togive the welcome-home kiss. Every one isinter ested inthis question, high and low, rich and poor (Hall 1867: 77-78). Thedisease-producing nature ofurban life affected all. Butitclearly from itspread to the innocent.192 Anumber myinformants commented onimbalances and excesses lead ing todisease. Onseveral occasions Mrs. Pierce attributed illness to excessive activity. In1869 she wrote that her husband, \"James has not been well for aweek ormore; inthefall there isalways arush ofware house business, and heworks very hard indeed, and then theheat and work combined, and abad state ofthe system brought onabilious attack so that hewas quite miserable for awhile\" 10/10/1869). Afew run activities andcaring for ayoung baby. This excess ofactivity caused her old complaints and aloss of appetite andpaleness (Pierce 1869-1888: 7/22/1873). Mrs. Newmark also suffered from over-work. Taking care ofher sick daughter and also working inthe family store once caused her tobecome very ill with abad cough, sothat she had toretreat tothe country.

This con stant strain was too much for any man tostand long, and assoon asthe body was taken sick his mind gave way under thepressure, and the malady soon found his weak estorgan--the heart (diseased byinheritance)--and that soon ended him (How 1869-1874: 6/23/1872). This extract illustrates how inherited susceptibility could bebrought out byexcessive activity. One's natural constitution could also dictate survival. Howe commented that inspite ofthe poor health andgrief of the widow, \"Ibelieve she may eventually recover entirely, for she has naturally avery strong constitution\" (Howe 1869-1874: 5/6/1872). Having various ofone's systems out lead toillness.

Could such excesses affect the good 1ife inthe Bay Area ofthe1980s? Auto-immune deficiency disease andherpes virus have both received much attention recently asdiseases attributed tosexual194 excess and immorality. Regularity inone's life and care with one's diet were valued. Mrs. Pierce commented onthese issues frequently. She watched her owndiet and that ofher children, and she wrote hersister that she should eat more and take less medicine. She recommended that anolder woman who was notstrong \"eat good rare steak and aglass ofport every day, will\". And sheattributed the and Seasoning The concern that professional medical men had for conditions ofthe climate and atmosphere was found also atthepopular level. For example, thepopular 19th-century theory ofacclimation proposed resi dence immunity to10cal Inits most general sense, the\"seasoning\" process referred toaperiod ofsettlement in which diseases and other hardships \"became aparticularly direct form of natural selection which took both stamina and luck tosurvive\". Settlers who crossed the country were expected toexperience this seasoning process for thefirst fewyears, after which they were acclimated. The actual illness referred towas usually malaria (ague, chills). Malaria became soprevalent onthefrontier that itwas accepted asanormal part of life there. People with chronic malaria could predict the cycles of chills and fever, sothey could schedule their activities inthe interims. The disease was common inSanFrancisco andoutlying communities (see Chapters Five andEight). There was acommon belief that long residents were immune toother infectious diseases, who communicated popular health ideas expressed beliefs intheassociation between health, disease, andclimate. The Family Health Annual published inOakland bytheEclectic sect placed great emphasis onthe dangers ofseasonal diseases. InJanuary staying in doors toavoid the cold resulted inthe spread ofsmallpox, measles, scarlatina and diseases, especially ventilated dwell ings ofimmigrants. InFebruary rain brought croup, diphtheria, pneumonia, and colds. The sudden changes oftemperature and cold winds ofMarch produced throat ailments. This changeable weather continued inApril, \"spring Housekeepers ornear ease\". heat brought putrefaction ofdecaying matter and subsequent bowel disturbances. And inJuly convulsions were produced bydysentery and disordered digestion resulted from badair, water and food. InAugust infant mortality became \"really appalling\" from cholera infantum, diarrhea, and dysentery. These diseases again resulted from poor air and food aswell asdrinking iced drinks and eating ice cream during hotweather (hot/cold theory). September brought the\"autumnal fevers\", i.e., malaria, which continued into October. Inaddition, tostart wearing \"warm suits ofunderclothing\" influenza. Typhoid, typhus andscarlet fever occurred inNovember when many women and children confined themselves indoors in poorly ventilated rooms. December was the most fatal month forcon sumptives whose lungs gave outalso from staying instuffy rooms. It was important for them toget sun and airoutside, warmly dressed, of course (The Family Health Annual 1878). The dampness ofCalifornia's winter wet season wasespecially cited asdangerous inthis advice: Mold frequently makes its appearance, adding tothe chilling dampness another danger, that ofgerm poison ing. Vapors laden with organic matter ascend from the kitchen ...condense upon the cold walls ofunwarmed rooms. Soon, decomposition ofthe organic matter begins, and poisonous germs and gases are developed. Colds, croup, diphtheria, catarrh, consumption, rheumatism, neuralgia, goitre, originate inthe\u00ba dwelling rooms(The Family Health Annual 1878: 3). Roney remarked \"It was not going toagree with me.

Chapter Eleven explains how such almanacs were asuccessful 19th-century promotional technique forcertain patent197 medicines. Summary Chapter Nine Popular etiological beliefs about disease inthe19th-century re flected distinctions that are made cross-culturally concerning the immedi\u2014 ate (orinstrumental) andultimate (orpredisposing) causes wrath ofGod might beregarded astheultimate causes ofanillness that was not theidea ofcontagion agreed with thepopular view that theliving conditions oflower and immigrant classes were responsible for high disease rates. Nineteenth century domestic health manuals emphasized thenecessity ofgood diet and hygiene tomaintain systemic balances inthe body. This view reflected thecultural ideology ofthe body asanequilibrium model. Illness was aviolation ofsome natural law. Moderation was the key to good health. Obedience tonature replaced obedience toGod. Inthe case ofurban immigrants, thevictims ofdisease were blamed for causing their own fate through immoderate behavior. They became the focus ofpopular beliefs about disease contagion. Furthermore, any excessive behavior might bepassed onasanin herited predisposition toone's children. Thus immorality became an inescapable andfatal characteristic ofthe poor. Anyone might inherit aconstitutional type ortemperament such asthehealth department's periodic clean-up and close-down attacks onChinatown. Other folk orpopular beliefs about disease etiology included the hot/cold theory, and theavoidance ofany extremes oftemperature, work, exercise, eating, orsleeping. Excesses ofall kinds weakened the body and made itsusceptible todisease. These beliefs areillustrated in contemporary 1etters anddiaries. People were concerned more with the how and why ofdisease anditsimplications than with itsetiology and \"illness\" thus treatment. Their social orcultural construction of differed from that ofthephysician who brought theindividual experience into hissystematized conceptions of\"disease\". People shared the physicians' equilibrium model ofthe human body andattributed illness episodes toimmoderate behavior, including thestress ofurban life. They feared that the excesses ofcrowded immigrants would create communicable diseases reaching allclasses. Unemployment, overcrowding, anxiety and overwork and consequent excesses inself-indulgence obviously resulted in disease inthis conception. Moderation and regular habits were recom\u2014 mended, asthey are today, topreserve one's health. Additionally, climatic changes determined health and disease. Again extremes orsudden changes oftemperature, winds, andother features were regarded asdeleterious, andcertain seasons brought characteristic diseases. SanFrancisco's cold, rain, and fog were blamed for many ills. InChapter Fourteen Ishall describe how climate was regarded asthera peutic aswell. Endnotes Chapter Nine \"confirming these American attitudes, Haley (1978) notes that inGreat -/ I.199 Britain among the middle and upper classes there was noclear distinction between mind and body, whether mind implied areligious, social, ormoral condition. Upper class people believed inamental ormoral ultimate cause and aphysical immediate cause for poor health. Health and disease were thus indicative ultimately ofgeneral societal well-being (Haley 1978: 11, 21-29, 45, 59). The general populace there had accepted acontagionist explanation ofdisease since their 14th-century experience with plague. But they blamed its spread onoutcast groups, suggesting amoral interms of appetite and weight gain. Women atthat time, quite unlike women today, proudly announced increases intheir weight. For example, Hannah Bourn Ingalls was pleased towrite her husband when she went from 142% to145 pounds. She aimed for 150 pounds, and hoped to10sethat weight (Ingalls 1865-1866: 1etters 5,8,11). *In herhistory ofhousework, Susan notes liked the upheaval ofspring cleaning. Shequotes Emily Dickinson, who said, wet season, Icanattest totheconviction that damp and mold breed headaches, sore throats and runny noses.200 CHAPTER TEN: SECTARIAN ALTERNATIVES Medical sects appeared inthe United States inthe 1830s when Thomsonianism, hydrotherapy and homeopathy became popular. There were numerous other sects that came and went aswell, but these three were most successful. The Thomsonian sect promoted self-treatment with herbal orbotanic medicines (Berman 1951). Hydrotherapy involved water cures, usually conducted atspas. Its advocates, like the Thomsonians, eschewed professional medicine (Weiss and Kemble 1967; Legan 1971a). was, andis, and cures, was areaction theharshness Faculty through the use of emetic 10belia, cayenne pepper, and steam baths. These techniques health movement ofthelate 20th-century. Definitely anti-establishment, Thomsonianism disappeared asits approaches became institutionalized. movement fractured into splinter groups debating thevalue oftraining andprofessionalization. The eclectic group later established their own colleges andjournals. Known201 as\"progressive Thomsonians\", they added standard medicine tothebotani cals. eclectic practitioners split from the Thomsonians they desig nated themselves asMedical Reformers. oreclectic. Wepropose todispense with harsh, unpleasant, and antiphlogistic remedies, substituting those that act kindly andpleasantly, andincrease organized Medical Society ofCalifor nia with its own board ofmedical examiners. The regulars responded by suggesting that \"These 'Eclectics' are acurious folk.... Thefirst and only distinctive article oftheir creed isthat they shall not beat liberty tochoose certain remedies. With such acreed 1875 inOakland. school moved toSan Francisco in1888, having \"the distinction ofbeing the only Eclectic Medi cal College onthe'Pacific Slope''' (Wilder 1901: 729). Eclecticism was defined in1877 byone ofits local adherents, J. H. Bundy, inhis Society ofCalifornia: demands aconservation ofthevital 1877: 6). Bundy declared that itwas not asect, but a scientific understanding ofdisease etiology and treatment. Eclectics202 recognized the advances being made inNatural Philosophy; i.e., in anatomy, physiology, organic chemistry. They condemned regular physicians forrelying simply onnosology fortherapeutic choices. Theeclectics viewed themselves asmedical reformers: Eclecticism seeks tobuild up, strengthen, and support, aiding, inevery possible way, thenatural vital powers ofthe system toovercome disease. Allopathy teaches depletion. ..inits blind endeavors the of oneaffection bysubstituting another. Eclecticism. .. . professes tohave themselves upon thedisease. thedisease isremoved, the remedy goes with it(Bundy Bundy stressed that medicine was in atime andconflict, and that eclectic physicians felt aresponsibility tokeep upwith these currents ofthought and change. That the average person was cognizant ofthe fine points ofmedical andetiological debate Butbelief in vital powers orforces ofthe body was popular. The theory ofvitalism suggested that disease was animbalance inthebody's vital force that required correction. This belief was formulated for popular consumption bylocal eclectics inthe Family Health Annual. Itwas published bythePacific Press of Oakland, associated with the Oakland Health Institute, ofwhich J. H. Bundy was one oftheproprietors. It, inturn, was associated with the Battle Creek, Michigan College and Sanitarium, which were supported by J. H.Kellogg.\" Inaddition toadvice about hygiene and diet disseminated byThe Family Health Annual, the Oakland Health Institute offered various forms oftreatment, including \"Turkish, Roman, Russian, Magnetic, Electric, andall Medicated Baths. Vacuum apparatus forParalysis, Rheumatism, Lung Affections, etc. Health-lifts for strengthening and restoring muscular power... Lying-In Rooms\" (The Family. Health Annual 1878).203 Regular physicians inSanFrancisco were socontemptuous ofthis approach that they published frequent barbs about theeclectics. For example, in1872 they quoted from theAmerican Eclectic Medical (PMSJ (5): physician, Robert H.Cowen, in1871. Mrs. C.A.Cook was added in1873, along with aneclectic physician, G. W.Eggleston. In1875 another City Directory listed twobotanic physicians, T.M. D.Fillmore and Mrs. C.0.Regal; and five eclectic physicians. One ofthelatter advertised himself as\"Dr. H.N.Miner, Eclectic Physician Prof. ofObstetrics, Bishop 1875: 1190). used various kinds oftherapeutic baths fortheir patients. Hydrotherapy usually took place inspecial water-cure establish ments (see Chapter Fourteen).\" Itincluded drinking mineral waters as well asbathing, exercise, massage, sweating, drugs, andheat (Legan 1971a: 268). appeared inAmerica of Grahamism and under the 1eadership ofJohn Harvey Kellogg, modified hydro therapy continued Weiss edited practice ofthese approaches, asdid thelater hydropathic published Seventh-Day Adventists (Numbers 1977: 63-68). The City Directory ofSan Francisco listed Water Cure physicians each year inthe 1870s. were able toboard athisestablish ment and take \"Electro, Russian, Turkish and Thermal Baths, and every form to skin and lungs (Lloyd 1876: 343-348). People ofallclasses did tryvarious types ofwater cure. The Kingsley family, farmers ofRed Bluff, California, occasionally took steam baths locally fortheir health (Kingsley 1874). Harriet Lane Levy remin isced about her childhood spring all ofunimpaired digestion, but Father relish edthe easy sociability ofthe springs and, once there, felt itwould bewasteful not toprofit bymedication offered free toguests. surely beable toprevent trouble, hereasoned, and heforthwith established arigorous regime for himself and his family, drank deeply and often, and returned home enthusiastic and sunburned, declaring that hehad never felt better, forgetting that hehad never felt worse. The following year wewould seek new waters and lay the family kidneys upon thealtar of hisradiant faith (Levy 1975: 67-68, orig. pub. 1937). Some regular physicians were sarcastic about thewater-cure approach; others recommended it. Dr. Clemens M.Richter, aGerman physician who arrived inSan Francisco in1872, commented that Dr.Zeile there \"had been apioneer, wore arich fur coat when driving, ordered steambath as the sovereign remedy for most ailments (he owned the steambath building) and never had time toexamine apatient\". Inspite ofhiscriticism, Richter inherited Zeile's patients (Richter Mrs. Joseph Newmark wrote inthelate 1870s that hersister became ill and was treated for four weeks by\"Dr. thebest went there her twochildren. Mrs. Newmark said, \"The trip helped mydear sister very much. The spring water and the mud baths in Karlsbad strengthened her. They were inEurope twoyears sothat they might visit Karlsbad again\" (Newmark 1900: 11). Some years later theill ness returned, and hersister became deaf, paralyzed andmentally weakened before she died (Newmark 1900: 15). Electro-Magnetic Treatment Electro-magnetic treatment was apparently quite popular inSan Francisco. The City Directory listed five such physicians in1871, two206 ofthem women. There were eight in1873, and nine in1874, only six or seven for the next fewyears, and then twelve in1879 (Langley). In1870 the leading poked ofthe Homeopathic Healing Institute\" who wasactually hydrotherapy.

Theeditors were sarcastic about this treatment, but they did not point out that itwas clearly not homeopathic. Itwas awell known battery andsalt bath treatments inthe mid 1880s from aDr. Fine in Oakland. She received theelectric treatments almost daily atthedoctor's office and then took the salt baths at asanatarium. This doctor was also their general practitioner (Stein 1878-1886). ofelectromagnetism andelectric therapy began Dr. Elisha Perkins' \"metallic tractors\". Perkins believed that touching the body with these gold andsilver points would draw off dangerous electricity which accumulated and produced disease. Many subsequent electromagnetic therapists advocated either drawing electricity from the body oradding it. They manufactured magnetic belts, electric wrist bands, cravats, anklets, elbow pads, necklaces, head caps and corsets icians because they questioned claims that itcould cure anything. It was also distasteful tosome physicians because, Theapplication oftheelectrode tonerve after nerve, ormuscle after muscle ofapatient's body, menial process, not exactly consistent with thedignity whereof thedashing turnout, heavy watch and Itisrather too suggestive and chirurgic arts (Hopkins 1875: for\"chronic appeared inthe became amajor medical sect bythe 1870s.

Most homeopathic doctors were trained asregular physicians. Their clientele tended tobeupper class andaristocratic. Consequently, this208 sect became the most competitive with regular practitioners. Itwas especially popular because homeopathic treatments did not produce the harsh side effects ofregular medicine and theequally rigorous early Thomsonian approach. Women appreciated the domestic kits for home practice medica, aswesaw inPart Two. regulars calomel, treat ments, the homeopaths began toquestion thedoctrine ofinfinitesimal dosages. Some homeopaths adopted regular medicines. Bythe the sect had divided into purists andeclectic homeopaths. Thelatter group became more and more 1egitimized.

For example, Edward Howe wrote his aunt in1871: Ihave suffered awfully with dyspepsia. ...You may be pleased tohear that Ihave been trying theeffect of homeopathy lately, and Ithink Ifeel better for a little dosing. Soon after coming here Imade the acquaintance ofayoung homeopathic physician who had210 graduated atthe medical school inNew York, and who seems tounderstand his business well.

These were major attractions ofhomeopathy. In1877 aBay Area society matron wrote toher aunt from atrip back east that both her children had been troubled with severe coughs. She diagnosed her son ashaving anattack ofcroup (1aryngeal obstruction). She reported that, Iused what Icould then get -molasses vinegar &cold water, and asIhave quite alarge collection of homeopathic medicines with me, and amost excellent book ofdirections, Igave him doses every 15minutes until 6 inthe morning when heseemed better and went tosleep (Pierce 1869-1888: 3/18/1877). She found however, that acure came about through use ofafriend's recommended \"wort syrup, which acted like acharm\". Another appeal of homeopathic medicines was that one could doctor oneself, asMrs. Pierce did when travelling. Military people inunsettled and remote areas used homeopathic remedies. For example, Robert LaMotte was anarmy captain who hadleft San Francisco toserve inKansas and Montana. Hewrote his mother about life there with his wife and small son inthe 1ate 1860s. His mother was especially interested indetails about her grandson Harry. InApril 1867 LaMotte wrote her: homeopathy has done him somuch that heisnow almost, ifnot quite his oldself.

Summary Chapter Ten The sectarian medical alternatives available toSan Franciscans in the 1870s included homeopathy, hydrotherapy andelectro-magnetic treat ment. The eclectics carried onthe tradition ofbotanic medicine. The homeopaths andeclectics each organized themselves into local medical societies and colleges. Eclectics regarded themselves asmedical re shared popular beliefs inthe homeostasis ofthe human body. Hydrotherapy usually occurred inspecial establishments where patients drank water, bathed, exercised, sweated and were massaged. Many eclectic physicians included this approach intheir repertoire. Hydrotherapy car ried onthe European tradition ofhealth spas and thecurative powers of spring water. Itwas often accompanied byforms ofelectro-magnetic treat ment inwhich bath water was \"magnetised\" orelectrodes were touched to nerves and muscles.212 The most respected sectarian alternative was homeopathy. This approach originated intheearly 19th-century bySamuel Hahnemann, remains apopular alternative tothis from the upper classes andappreciated themildness ofhomeopathic medicines. These medicines were available topeople for home prescription and use, although this practice was discouraged byhomeopathic phys icians. The San Francisco City Directory listed members ofthe medical sects aswell asregular physicians each year. Though fewer innumber, thesectarians ofdifferent kinds of \"irregular\" medical practitioners, asthe name implies. They were usually nottrained in\"regular\" schools, andrejected most heroic medicines. *By the 1890s abranch ofthe Battle Creek Institute was established near SanFrancisco attheKellogg's spa atSt. Helena inthe Napa Valley, where some health spas survive today (Anderson 1890). *There isalong history towater cure, dating from classical was brought officially toAmerica byVincenz Priessnitz inthe inducing kind ofsuffering.

These medicines derived from along history in which cures were regarded asespecially efficacious ifsecretive. Patent medicines often retained anair topeople's beliefs regular profession increasingly justification ofits medicines offered distinction, experience, effort, and reason are valid; onthebelief that hope cannot fail nordesire deceive\" (Malinowski 1948: 87). The regular physicians were attempting togain hegemony over medical practice inSan Francisco byrationalizing their beliefs ized onthe advantage ofopenly appropriating magic and mystery. The general public, concerned with prognosis, looked forreassurance that they would becured; that both thephysical disease inwrongdoing could increasingly pre ofscience they defeated their ownefforts tocompete with \"quacks\". Patent medicines could offer magic theactual words magic, miracle, and mystery intheir names.215 Patent medicine manufacturers secured their hold onsuch beliefs about healing byobtaining copyrights onthe labels orliterature which described their nostrums,\" without revealing actual contents. There were thousands ofsuch medicines, but fewobtained patents because they required revela tion ofingredients (Young 1961: 40). Since the term patent medicine was more popular than thealternative proprietary medicine, Ishall useitin spite ofits inaccuracy. The spread ofnewspaper advertising inthe United States produced great popularity for these medicines. The usual approach was toadvertise long lists ofgeneral symptoms, such that anyone might identify him orher self asill. Examination ofpatent ads reveals the use ofevery adver tising ploy from sex toexploitation offear. Beautiful young women glowed with health, death's heads anddistorted bodies illustrated disease. Exotic sources ofcures were claimed. Testimonials were widely used, often from professional men, clergymen, regular physicians, aswell ascured patients. Some testifiers were convinced that the remedy worked, others were paid fortheir recommendations (Young 1961: 176, 183, 188). Often these remedies did work, aspurges orlaxatives bringing relief toAmeri cans who typically overate and ate toofast. Promoters ofpatent medicines were often dishonest about their in-- gredients. Patients sought alternatives totheharshness ofregular practice; butpatent remedies often contained mercury, alcohol and opium. They operated under alaissez-faire economy inwhich American cultural values venerated success, notethics. Ittook many years theregular profession toachieve enough success ascendency ofits ownethics. The medicine salesman shared thebusinessman's ethic ofshrewd practice (Young 1974: 5). Competition among patent manufacturers was216 fierce and fewreached thelevel ofthebigadvertisers. They promoted their products not only innewspapers but infree literature left in stores anddelivered door-to-door. They advertised inmail-order cata\u2014 logs, even innovels. They formed trade associations (Young 1961: 103- 108). Patent medicine promoters developed the idea ofdistributing alman acs toreach thepublic. Some were onhome remedies, orchildren's books (Hechtlinger 1970: 127). The most famous, Ayer Almanacs, were translated into 21languages to reach the immigrant population. Dr. Hostetter, who sold his Celebrated Stomachic Bitters Tonic, put out analmanac inCalifornia inthe 1870s. Almanacs reinforced Inspite oftheir effort toget thebusiness ofimmi grants, almanacs typically presented cruel ethnic cartoons, caricaturing Irish, Jews, Blacks and American Indians. These manufacturers sold books that gave general medical advice as well asadvertising their remedies and asking fororders.\" Such books did infact educate people. Asistrue today, useful advice about pre ventive care and hygiene rarely came from professional physicians, who concentrated ontreating and curing established disease. Someone refer ring toW. W.Hall's 1869. The Guide-Board toHealth, Peace and Competence would have found advice onsuch topics asbathing, marriage, exercise, sleeping inthe same bed, rapid eating, tea and coffee, foul air inun ventilated places, care ofthehair, use oftobacco, and soon. Hall also advised that cholera was transmitted spread tothehonest \"voluptuous\" them Readers and books bypurveyors ofpatent medicines were early informed ofincipient germ theory. The manufacturers quickly capitalized onclaims that their nostrums were germ killers (Young 1961: 144). They could easily adapt their flexible views onetiology ofdis- ease toinclude germ theory. They were able toprofit from the grave state oftransition oftheregular profession. For example, R.W.Pierce, inThePeople's Common Sense Medical Adviser published in1889, explained medicine tohis readers .Shrewdly rejecting the term, patent medicine, since hehad never applied forpatents, Dr. Pierce said his remedies ananti-periodic for cure ofmalaria and other miasmatic diseases. Itneutralized poison inthe system the badeffects ofquinine (Hechtlinger 1970: 183-189). Many patent medicines deliberately excluded ingredients found in regular medicines, such asquinine orcalomel. Most infact relied on alcohol. For example, Hostetter's Bitters was 44per cent alcohol. Patent medicines also contained opium and morphine and various minerals such as iron, steel, creosote and petroleum. Inaddition, they contained thetra ditional herbs and home remedies that had been recommended ascures atan earlier time. In1877 thePacific Medical and Surgical Journal published thecontents of 12patent medicines. They quoted directly from Steiger's Popular Health Almanac. Forexample, Ayer's Ague Cure was,218 six ounces ofadark red syrupy liquid, with aslight white sediment, avery bitter of bythe aid itissweetened with sugar and flavored with white sediment consists ofsulphate oflime. AndJayne's Ague Mixture: capsicum, spirits and cannabis. People spent much oftheir money onpatent medicines when they were sick, but probably less than they would have wasted ontheusually ineffective treatments ofdoctors. And they felt some personal control over their situation (Smith 1979; 345). Although the American Medical Association and the American Pharma ceutical Association were both organized inpart toprotest patent medi cines and other forms of\"quackery\", effective legislation was not passed until the20th-century. The Food and Drug Act of1906 was greeted bytremendous opposition among patent medicine manufacturers (Young 1961: 244). Current controversies propose legislation tocontrol \"quackery\" in1980s San Francisco (Public Affairs Research Group 1981). Many people disliked anddistrusted regular medicines inSanFran cisco. The homeopaths suggested that people avoid all regular, and patent, medicines. For example, they opposed the use ofquinine inmalaria treatment: \"It may stop your ague, but leaves aworse disease behind, the quinine disease, from which you may beyears inrecovering\". Homeopaths219 recommended home treatment with their remedies only under aphysician's direction, and warned against medicines sold ashomeopathic \"specifics\". They criticized other \"domestic medication\": \"the amount ofsuffering engendered andperpetuated, and the amount ofmoney wasted annually by the purchase anddomestic use pills, teas, and sundry other 'regular, domestic compounds\" (The Family Health Annual 1878; 17). People commented ontheside effects ofmedicine. For example, Carolina Kingsley noted inher 1874 diary that taking sulphur for \"a breaking out\" made her \"almost sick\". The medicine must not have helped her, for she remained ill forseveral more weeks (Kingsley 1874; 3/1874). Margaret Pierce referred objected topatent medicines, but otherwise they had an accepted place among alternative practices inSan Francisco. Guillermo Prieto, visiting from Mexico ofthelively presence ofpatent other alternatives in San Francisco : Athousand tricksters, sharpers and charlatans display their anelectri cal device fortreating hemorrhage, rheumatism, dyspepsia, and every scourge ofunhappy mankind.

Not surprisingly, the regular professionals were distressed tosee this \"charlatanism and quackery\" all about them.

His wholesale agents inSan Francisco distributed a number ofpatent medicines aswell asthe almanac earlier. The almanac advertised \"Triumphs ofHostetter's Stomach Bitters inCalifor miners inthese states Many deaths hadresulted from the use of standard heroic remedies, quinine andalcohol, until this \"great Antidote toEpidemic Diseases\" arrived (Hostetter's Almanac 1868). two respected members oftheprofession published criticisms ofpatent medicines.

Thus estab lished for such patent medicines asMrs. Young who \"flashed into fame andinto business through theinstitution which graduates nearly all the quacks intheworld--the newspaper press\", according toGibbons.

This man may have been Benjamin F.Josselyn, who advertised inthe 1870 Overland Almanac for the Dr. Medi Street. The adlamented the poisoning Itproposed ormoney refunded (Overland Almanac 1870: 25). Gibbons described the process bywhich men have taken natural sources such aswild cucumber, yarrow, and dogwood and turned them into bitters. These remedies were endorsed byclergymen and advertised innewspapers. Success was ensured fortheir \"doctor\" manufacturers. Lamenting the alcohol content ofbitters, teetotaler Gibbons felt they were \"1ittle more than lures todrunkenness: The formula then, for medicinal bitters ingeneral, runs thus: Take ofcheapest herb, root q.s. Mix, and flavor with anything ornothing. Put employ anexpert liar towrite labels and clergymen oftaste. Advertise largely andsell legitimate drugs. One such medicine, advertised in 1868, wasBristol's Sarsaparilla, \"The Great Spring and Pills. These pills ofroots, barks, flowers, leaves, plants and balsamic gums (Hostetter's Almanac 1868). Gibbons also mentioned twowell-known patent purveyors who had passed through San Francisco: Van Ehrenburg, who advertised heavily anddis appeared inthenight, \"King ofPain\" who sold aconite liniment (Gibbons 1874: 13). The journalist, W.F.Rae, observed King ofPain's methods in1870: Heprofessed not alldiseases, ahandsome carriage, hehalts now and then, and makes ashort speech. While heisretailing some ofthemiraculous cures which hehas effected, having the appearance ofasailor, oramechanic, stops and exclaims, 'What's that you say about Boston?' The quack replies, 'Sir, Ihave just told these gentlemen how Mr. John A.Jones, aprominent citizen ofBoston, was cured by asingle bottle ofthis specific after all theother doctors had given himup.' 'Well, sir, that's so. Icome from Boston, and Iknow was cured medicine' possessing remarkably \"according toitspromoter. Lloyd further observed curative properties, ' that \"quacks\" inSanFrancisco focused onspecific diseases resulting from the damp chill ofthecity, such ascatarrh and rheumatism. Most exploited the high incidence ofvenereal diseases. Hedescribed a McBride, whocalled himself \"ascientist, ofthe his patent medicines bytravelling through thecity with acoach and four, first with anemaciated patient, and then with ahealthy one, supposedly thefirst man cured (Lloyd 1876: 360, 443-445). Did people support thecareers ofthese medicine men simply out of ignorance orsimple-mindedness asphysicians suggested, orwasitbecause they found norelief inregular medicines and turned toalternatives as people with incurable diseases dotoday? Aformer San Franciscan and employee ofalocal newspaper, wrote tothe mayor in1874 expressing con cern about the smallpox epidemic. Hewished tocommunicate asimple, swift cure which had worked for him the year before and for four ofhis friends, without aid ofphysicians. Heargued that hewas notselling the remedy, just recommending it. ThePacific Medical andSurgical Journal printed his statement, butleft out the name ofthe medicine. The editors commented onhowincredible for medical treatments forsmallpox didlittle more forthis terrifying disease than whatever his cure entail ed. That patent medicines were extremely popular inSanFrancisco, asin other cities, issuggested bythe very newspaper advertising ofthe Daily Alta California. The San Francisco Chronicle presented many medi caladvertisements. Sanford's Radical Cure forCatarrh appeared daily in 1877 inalong Two ads appearing people who know nobetter medicine complaint. The effects ofeither ofthese drugs aredestructive tothe system, producing headache, intestinal disorders, vertigo, dizziness, ring ing oftheears, and depression oftheconstitutional health. AYERS AGUE CURE isavegetable discovery, containing neither Liver andbiliary apparatus, thus stimulating the system toavigorous, healthy condition.

White swell ing, salt rheum, tetter, abscesses, liver complaint and eruptions ofevery description are invariably conquered by it. Druggists sell it(San Francisco Chronicle 11/23/1878: p.2,c.2). These advertisements expressed two ofthe most prevalent and worrisome diseases experienced inSan Francisco atthis time. They illustrate a number ofpopular medical themes. The use ofregular medicines isdeplored asdangerous and unpleasant. The importance oftheconstitution, biliary system and bloodstream are emphasized. Both miasmatic andviral theories ofdisease are suggested. The horrors ofdisease are played upon, but cures are assured. Other patent medicines advertised inthis newspaper included Boscher's225 German Syrup which had\"astonishing success incuring severe coughs, colds settled onthebreast, consumption, oranydisease ofthethroat and lungs\"; Peruvian Chronicle 1877). Examples issued bypatent medicine men appeared in1870s SanFrancisco. LeDoyen's Pacific Almanac for the Use ofFarmers, Miners, Merchants, andFamilies promoted LeDoyen's Sarsaparilla through the reminder: \"HOW DREADFUL ISDISEASE! HOW JOYOUS LIFE 1BEWARE OFPOISONS''' Unlike heroic remedies, this medicine could begiven toanyone without injury. Itwas used against all fevers Pacific People ofallclasses responded tosuch ads, tothe dismay ofregular physicians. The labor leader Frank Roney noted inhis diary that hefelt sick after drinking, and continued sick \"after taking anew kind ofbitters called tosee adoctor after several weeks ofillness, and cure\" for him (Stein 1878-1884: 2/25/1884). Recalling her childhood, Harriet Lane Levy described hermother's use ofpatent medicines. Physicians recommended \"plasters,\" which could be homemade with flour and mustard, orbought aspatent medicines: 'Alcock's Porous Plaster cures every ill,\" announced the billboards, and everybody agreed that, for chronic dis226 comfort, itwas the remedy. The porous plaster, once clapped onto the body, withstood temperature and water and survived weeks ofbaths anddryings, eventually tobe parted from the skin after savage resistance (Levy 1975: 201, orig. pub. 1937). Summary Chapter Eleven Aneven more popular alternative than the medical sects was the use ofpatent medicines. They were promoted, readily available, relatively cheap, andself-prescribed. Bythe 1870s there were thousands ofthese products competing forpublic consumption. Their manufacturers were not constrained bythenecessity ofrational, scientific medical explan ations. They capitalized instead onpeople's desire for amagical cure. They advertised inthe popular press and emphasized thehorror ofillness contrasted toextravagant cures. annual almanacs topromote their products. Tosome extent they offered helpful advice forpreventive care and hygienic practice, advice often neglected byregular physicians. Patent medicines contained alcohol, cannabis, morphine and opium, which undoubtedly dulled thedaily aches and pains for which people use Extra-Strength Tylenol orstronger tranquilizers today. The patents also contained various minerals and traditional herbs. The regular profession aswell aseclectics and homeopaths naturally fought the use ofpatent medicines, but noregulations were effective until the20th-century. Patent medicine purveyors did alively business inthe newspapers and onthestreets ofSan Francisco. They directed their appeals tospecific diseases suffered there, such astuberculosis, malaria, rheumatism, andsyphilis. Certain patent medicine purveyors such Doctor Young, achieved quite forquackery patent ads deplored the use ofharsh and dangerous227 \"regular\" medicines, but many contained some ofthe same ingredients. Endnotes Chapter Eleven *Anostrum used diseases, malaria, neuralgia, dyspepsia, andscrofula. John Haller suggests that the chronic dyspepsia among Victorians might have resulted from the use ofFowler's Solution containing arsenic (Haller 1981: 91-96). QUACKS AND CHARLATANS: THE PHYSICIANS\" RESPONSE Regular physicians inSan Francisco complained through the 1870s about the presence ofcompeting practitioners. Several arguments appear edconsistently from 1869 to1880: other arguments appeared only late in the decade. Debates between regulars and\"irregulars\" have revived in the 1980s, supplemented bythe commentaries ofsociologists, representa tives ofspecific interest groups, health activists, andradical critics (Public Affairs Research Group 1981). Most importantly, alternative practitioners inthe 1870s were pre sented as\"quacks\" andcharlatans\"; that hoax. Bylabeling their compe titors inthis way regular practitioners were able tofurther legitimize their ownposition. Alternative practitioners were described throughout the decade asexploiting and fleecing the unsuspecting public. Forex ample, in1870 thePacific Medical and Surgical Journal reported the story ofaconsumptive who had come specifically toSan Francisco toconsult a doctor who advertised cures. Friends had raised the money for this visit. The doctor demanded twenty dollars attheoutset, made noexamination; and proposed that itwould cost Hecommented that \"No one other than aheartless and mandacious villain would have held out hopes ofcure tothis poor man and taken his Hewas exposed during alecture when someone telegraphed tothat city com\u2014 mented that \"people still proclaims hisskill inthe cure ofdisease\" (PMSJ 1875 XVI(10): 501-502). The People Are Ignorant Another argument consistently made against quacks was that they relied onthe ignorance andcredulity ofthepublic. In1869 anarticle circulated inthepress entitled that too few people onhuman credulity (California Medical Gazette April 1869: 172). The following year anews paper editorial argued that \"brazen humbuggery exists everywhere\". People would stop resorting tosuch practitioners asthey became better educated, and assoon astheregular profession improved its owntherapeutics. If theregular physicians stopped claiming infallibility, people would not turn toalternatives (Daily Alta California 1/7/1870: p. 2, c.1).\" Also in1870 amedical journal editorial complained that regular physicians were forced out ofpractice inthecity because ofthe ignorance ofthepublic: \"never was there aplace where somany desperate charlatans were pushing themselves upon unsuspecting invalids and thriving upon their fears\". This writer blamed theregular profession inpart fortheir \"apathy anddemoralization\" about the problem (California Medical Gazette Feb. 1870 2:126).230 Toward the end ofthe decade similar arguments were made about medi\u2014 calignorance. Dr. M. M. Chipman said in1878 that most people under stood little about anatomy, pathology, health and disease: orabout the skill ofphysicians. Hefelt that public education inhygiene eventually... towards evolving wise andefficient sanitary ofthepeculiar American urgings, awealthy and respectable citizen was responsible for leading people tothehealer, Mrs. Preater, that year. This man had been treated foryears byhomeopathy, which Dr. G.W.Graves felt accounted that, \"She has amoustache and a goatee, and inthese probably lies herstrength. Itisthe old story re peated. Thousands ofsuch miraculous healers have appeared atdifferent times and runtheir course for aseason. They enough (PMSJ 1878 XXI(7): 329-330). The thepublic preferred theless iatro genic effects ofalternative medical approaches (see Chapter Eight). But some physicians felt that itwas apoor policy toexpose The newspaper advocated such publication tohelp educate thepublic and improve their choices ofphysicians. Theeditorial suggested that the medical pro fession must improve its schools anditsqualifications forpractice, for \"the science ofmedicine... isand has been full ofblunders and blunderers\". Regular physicians could learn even from alternative schools ofthought (Daily Alta California 1/7/1870: p.2,c.1). Agreeing with this criticism ofthemedical profession, Dr. Q.C. Smith wrote nine years later that people turned toquacks because lazy physicians did not keep upwith their profession. This unqualified group, when notvisiting patients, spend their time sitting and loitering around places ofpublic resort, telling and hearing puns and jokes, whittling splinters down tothelittle end ofnothing, arguing politics and party measures, toying afancy cane, and smoking long nine cigars, and maybe, occasionally 'taking asmile,\" 1azily wasting their precious time insilly efforts tocurry favor with thepublic (Smith 1879: 542-545). Such physicians were clearly not conveying the proper professional and scientific image. Only Quacks Advertise Physicians objected strongly tomedical handbills and public ads. Itprotested that some members ofthe San Francisco Medical Society were given credit in newspaper ads forvarious cures andoperations. This ments forpatent medicines that enticed people, especially appealing to sexual problems. Reviewing thehistory ofvarious patent medicines pur veyors, Gibbons remarked that the quack must drum upbusiness: \"Pamphlets, newspapers, distribute that reading ofdiseases causes persons tofancy themselves sick, and sometimes even makes them sick\". Gibbons presented thetypical scenario: Inthis city... there are... hundreds ifnot thousands of men, who have been startled from their daily 1abors in the mines andfields and work-shops byreading thewell devised, sensational advertisements which pollute the columns ofalmost every newspaper. Gathering uptheir hard earnings, they hie them away tothecity and rush into the trap. Their fears are realized; their apprehen sions are promoted, and inadvance. inthetoils, their course isonward and downward, forever (Gibbons 1874: 10). Gibbons himself knew how touse high rates ofboth unemployment and syphilis were somehow attributable to quack advertising ! Also in1874 Dr. R. W.Murphy published anarticle criticising the use Hedescribed the ways inwhich they were adver tised: The numerous traveling agents that overrun our land, painting their advertisements onevery house, fence and board; posting handbills onevery corner and sending them thousands ofmiles through thePost-office; distributing them infamilies, publishing sworn certi ficates, purchased for apaltry sum, inpamphlet form, accompanied, perhaps, with the calendar for the year (all ofwhich isgraciously given away); columns of advertisements inour daily and weekly newspapers, offering specific cures for any and every disease (Murphy 1874: 590).233 Herecommended legislation tocontrol these medicines. ofMedical Ethics, asthey had orpharmacists for the promotion ofquack advertising. Henry Gibbons, Sr. had commented in1874 that \"apothecaries sometimes prostitute their office andbeget nostrums\". They themselves became \"nostrum-mongers\", using knowledge acquired intheir pharmacies (Gibbons 1874: 2). Dr. Murphy commented that year that patent medicines accounted fortwo-thirds ofdruggists' sales (Murphy 1874: 592-593). What was worse was when quack advertising appeared inmedical jour nals themselves, and inother professional journals. This practice was also blamed onthepharmacists. Infact pharmacists' ads provided most ofthe revenue onwhich these journals relied. But Henry Gibbons, Sr. found in1878 that the ads were \"impregnated, ifnotsaturated, with quackery. .. .Even proprietary remedies and secret nostrums are allowed to thrust their brazen fronts into thejournals\". Hegave examples ofsuch ads and called upon the pharmaceutical organizations toclean uptheir act. Heremarked that their job was toprepare medicines, not topre scribe them (Gibbons 1878c). The pharmacists had responded tosuch criticism in1874 that the physicians were responsible forthis problem because they were thepre scribers. And many physicians provided certificates ofmerit topatent medicines (\"puffs\"). Theregular profession responded that thepharmacists should puttheir own house inorder before they criticized others (PMSJ234 1874 XVI(5): 254-257). Thus accusations andcounter-accusations were exchanged. In1875 areligious journal deplored patent medicine advertising inother such journals. The Rev. Stephen H.Tyng commented that such \"uncivilized countries\" like Africa and medicines might beall right in \"Feejee\" where native doctors might beaworse evil than thepatents, orinrural areas where doctors were often incompetent. But where edu cated physicians were available, such advertising was people not togotoadoctor. The medical profession was naturally angry about this, especially since they sent prescriptions tobefilled bythe same druggists. Theobject ofphysicians' attacks clearly newspapers tothe pharm. acists: Wesay nothing ofthe newspapers selling their columns to quacks and impostors. This istheir business, and people expect nothing better. But have wenot aright tolook forbetter conduct from druggists, Power ofNature Early inthe decade anargument was made that appeared thereafter. Itwas that medical cults used ingredients from regular medicines, and therefore contradicted themselves. For example, in1869 aneditorial asked, \"What isEclecticism?\" Itquoted Dr. Scudder's approaches infavor of\"\"those that act kindly andpleasantly, and increase vital power'\". But theeditorial triumphantly No. 30: theeclectics not only used contradictory ingre\u2014 dients, but they also relied onregular medicine without In1870 aneditorial inthemedical choosing materials fortheir journals from among thewritings ofthe regular schools which they denounce\" (PMSJ May 1870 No. 36: 569). Again in1874 the same journal complained that theeclectic Medical Times copied many pages from \"the 'blood and murder' periodicals ofthe'regu 1ars' whom oftheir ownfaith !\"(PMSJ 1874 XVI(2): 104). Theeclectics would not deny however, that they used some regular medicines. Itwas part oftheir eclecticism (see Chapter Ten). The idea that alternative medicines were successful because they secretly used regular ingredients was counterpointed bythe argument that they succeeded because most diseases have anatural course. Dr. A. B. Nixon said in1872 that \"The apparent success ofhomeopathic treatment of (PMSJ 1873: 532). The Daily California newspaper inaneditorial that \"Alarge part ofthesuccess ofcharlatans is due tothe fact that they prescribe harmless stuff and their patients re cover bythehealing power ofnature\". Ifregular physicians used their strong medicines only for severe cases, more ofthose who were only \"slightly affected\" would recover more quickly (Daily Alta California 1/7/1870: p.2,c.1).236 Several regular physicians who favored Conservative Medicine were exceptionally honest about these realities. Dr. F. W.Hatch for example, argued that \"all intelligent physicians will two-thirds tothree-fourths oftheir sooner anddifficulty, recover without medicine\". Headvo cated diet, rest and hygiene (Medical Society oftheState ofCalifornia, Transactions... 1872 and 1873: 102). Rivalry with alternative medical systems became hostile and even irrational attimes. Akey point raised again and again during this de cade bymembers oftheregular profession was over the term \"allopath\" applied tothem byhomeopaths. For example in1873 physicians asked that people not bemisled bythis term into believing that regular practition ers were sectarian. They blamed eclectics and others for, attempting toterrify the uninformed with anugly sounding name like the man who mortally insulted another bycalling him and tomake the world, are murderous sectaries (PMSJ 1873 VII(3): 151-152). regular medical itdiffered from sectar ians not only inmedical training, but also inthat regular physicians were not exclusive ordogmatically constrained byasingle medical theory (see Coulter 1973: 140-236). The well-known public health physician, Dr. F. W.Hatch, stressed in1873 that legitimate medicine was acumula tive, progressive, nondogmatic science, unlike hydropathy, homeopathy, and that the term allopath not beused, because itimplied that regular doctors were inflexible intheir approaches. He also argued that patients ofalternative practitioners often recovered simply because oftheself-limited nature ofmost diseases. alternatives asfashionable \"medical they and were notmedical systems. They rested \"upon anexclusive dogma... narrowed down toasingle from which, ifthere beamomentary departure, thevitality ofthe Regular medicine however, was notexclusive (Hatch 1873: 98).\" Rather, the regular physician was empirical inhis approach, using what worked, often not knowing and not caring why, asinthe case of quinine. Hatch also strongly advised against \"roaming about after differ ent medical advisers inevery new many physicians still prefer such paternalism today. The argument against the term allopath continued through the decade. In1876 physicians argued that they were not dogmatic intheadministra practices became focused bythe end of the decade onthe two most threatening toregular medicine, the homeopaths and theeclectics.\" ThePacific Medical andSurgical Journal hadprinted numerous short, sarcastic pieces making fun ofthese two groups (e.g., Nov. 1869, No. No. alternative practices (e.g.,238 Nov. 1871, No. 54: No. however, sarcasm began tobeaccompanied bymore serious criticism, asthe two alternative schools became more popular. Thejournal suggested that there had been a\"change ofbase totheregulars, were \"exudation\" inadisease might produce now aware that different forms of similar symptoms, but require different treatments (PMSJ 1873 VII(4): 199 200). But inthe next year this cautious praise was replaced bythe usual carping about homeopathy (PMSJ 1874 XVI(7): 350). In1875 formation oftheEclectic State Medical Society was announced inthis journal. The editors again complained that their approach was tooexclusive and 1ed toquarreling among adherents, who then often left the\"Eclectic Church\" and entered theregular profession. This thehomeopaths, whose \"preposterous pharma sary for ahomeopathic aneditorial reported that ahomeopathic doctor sought advice from his colleagues torecover from a fall from ahorse. Hereported that hehad tried numerous remedies both from ahorse asnearly aspossible in the way you yourself fell.

They advertised treatment for Liver Complaint, giving, according tothecritics, \"atrain ofsymptoms with one ormore 360).

Sotheregulars argued that again they did not object tohomeopathic remedies when they were appropriate: \"Liberty touse what wewant is what distinguishes dogmatic\" (1): 21 22).240 The Medical Law Desire toincrease control over irregular practitioners brought about calls forlegislation tolicense themedical profession. In1875 Thomas Logan, Permanent such which nowsits like avampire upon the body politic, and which isnever satisfied until the last drop ofthe blood ofitsvictim isexhausted\" (State Board ofHealth, Third Biennial Report... 1874 and 1875: 6).

Patent medicine purveyors were con trolled byrequirement ofaone hundred dollar amonth (11):241 524). Fines were stipulated between fifty and five hundred dollars for illegal medical practice, orthirty days toayear inprison (PMSJ 1876 XVIII (11): 521-524). effectively given control over medicine totheregular profession ifithad been fully enforced. But itwas not (Dunlop 1965: 5).' The immediate criticism ofthe law inSan Francisco was that each State Medical Society was permitted aBoard ofExaminers. Thus the Homeo\u2014 pathic and Eclectic Medical Societies were allowed to1egitimise the practice oftheir adherents. The major San Francisco medical journal commented that the homeopaths immediately went out and organized asecond society for there would betwo inthestate (PMSJ 1876 XVIII (12): 586). Debate about the new medical law continued through the end ofthe decade. In1878 S.P.Crawford ofDixon, cures for astated thereputation ofa professional brother, catch cases byhook tomake money out of them\". Theeditors ofthePacific Journal responded that each ofthe three Boards ofExaminers had its own code ofethics. Ifall conformed tothe same code, homeopaths andeclectics would have the same status asregulars. That possibility was tobeavoided. In stead the law was meant tosegregate these practitioners from regular practice (PMSJ 1878 XXI(2): 64). The same editors, responding tocriticism, denied that the law was motivated byadesire toprotect the regular profession from rivalry: Itwas moved bythe same humane impulse which prompts the extended movements all over the world infavor ofhygienic and preventive medicine. Physicians are not tobebenefit tedpersonally through theculture and operation ofwhat242 has been called sanitary science. Onthecontrary, they cut medical law made noprovision atallcon cerning sanitation did not deter these editors from identifying regula tion ofmedical practice with thepopular sanitary movement. Laws of laws controlling were somehow aDr.Breyfogle, ahomeopath had graduated from aregular medical college, was appointed tothe California State Board ofHealth. The regulars complained that homeopaths were not concerned about public health. Aneditorial argued that \"The great principles ofhygiene and fact that many homeopaths opposed vaccination was presented asa particular danger. But that alternative practitioners were much earlier advocates ofhygienic and preventive health measures than were theregu 1ars was not mentioned. That aneclectic practitioner was found tobeonthe State Board of Health was not regarded astroublesome, since eclectics were similar to regular physicians, and\"less clannish andless aggressive than the homeo paths; and they have more common sense\". Eclectics were believed tobe soon absorbed intheregular profession, even though the examining boards \"some ofthe most notorious ofboth sects one ineighteen regular physicians was licensed onexamination diplomas, (49) (PMSJ243 1880xxIII (5):221).\" Summary Chapter Twelve The more general arguments against alternative medical practitioners inthe 1870s were that first ofall, they were charlatans. They relied onthe ignorance ofthe public which did not understand medical matters. Itwas argued that people also avoided physicians because they used heroic measures, had made errors which were publicized, and were lazy and did not keep upaprofessional image. The medical regulars also objected strenuously totheadvertising ofalternative practitioners andpatent medicine manufacturers. Finally they blamed their profes Sional colleagues, thepharmacists, for promoting, advertising andsell ingalternative medicines. Inaddition tothese general criticisms, more specific complaints were directed athomeopaths andeclectics. Regular physicians complained that the term allopath applied to them byhomeopaths relegated them tothestatus ofsect aswell. They wisely asserted that theirs was the\"regular\" or\"rational\" approach to medicine, with none ofthe dogmatic taint ofasect. The regular pro fession used several arguments toprove their legitimacy over compe titors. They claimed that eclectics and homeopaths actually used regular medicines toeffect their cures under theguise ofphony theories and methods. Finally ting thepractice chief rivals, eclectics and homeopaths, into licensed practice as well. Although itwas rarely enforced, this law served tooutlaw all Other alternative medical practices, such asthose Ishall discuss in244 Part Four. The medical law was defended byits proponents through an identification with the growing sanitary reform movement, inspite of thefact that itmade nostatement onthesubject. Nevertheless, the regular profession benefitted from the symbolic power ofthis law, which both identified illegitimate practitioners andassociated regular phys icians with the success ofthe public health movement.

Beyond meaning and reassurance, the healer isaided inhis effectiveness bythe nature ofmost diseases. self-limited diseases, ingdiseases, and somatized psychological problems. Inthese andcultural treatment, usually defined byprescribed rituals, play agreater role than attempts tocure disease. The pragmatic approach ofmost people cross-culturally leads them todistinguish types ofill nesses appropriate for types ofhealers. Thus itiscommon for people to take acute conditions toburgeoning Western scientific practice newly introduced totheir societies, and other illnesses totheir indigenous healers (Erasmus 1952; Paul 1955; Gould 1957; Foster 1962; Kleinman and These ofthehealing areuniversal andexisted athome were self-limited, chronic, orbeyond current curative abilities. Physicians themselves recognized theself-limited nature ofmany infectious diseases (Chapter Eight). Thebelief that the \"family doctor\" was may belargely amyth. From what weknow of heroic treatment and the immense popularity ofalternative practitioners, itseems likely that many regular physicians were viewed asimpersonal and mechanical, asthey are today. Class differences inmedical care meant that poor andethnic immigrants rarely saw a\"family doctor\" unless hewas one oftheir own. They attended dispensaries atbest and ended upinpublic medical institutions atworst. Given that regular physicians could not cure infectious diseases anyway, itisnotsurprising that people were attracted tothehealing powers ofothers. Atleast one contemporary physician recognized thepsychosocial nature ofthedoctor-patient interaction, and his ideas were reported in the SanFrancisco medical press in1879. Dr. J.S.Hammond ofNevada Wrote: theaverage professional man finds tenderness ofmanner toward the sick (Hammond 1879; 212). Hammond felt that patients were especially sensitive tothedoctor's attitude because oftheexcitable state Hestressed begentler and more respectful towards their patients; forotherwise patients would resort toalternative healers (Hammond 1879: 215). Unless regular physicians inspired confidence intheir patients,249 they would lose them tosuch alternatives. Asimilar phenomenon may be observed aschildbirth, orinthe harsh toappeal more and more tothecharismatic authority ofscience toattract patients (see Chapter Six). Inthis they initiated aprocess that came tounderlie the huge power of20th-century scientific medicine. Patients need nolonger share the medical ideology oftheir healers, for theritual paraphernalia andpractices ofmodern technology are overwhelming. Still, while this medicine may cure, itfails toheal. \"I11ness\" remains more common than \"disease\"; but modern physicians are\"trained tosystematically ignore illness\" (Kleinman and Sung 1979). Inboth centuries alternative healers have filled thesociocultural and economic gap between curing and healing. In19th-century New York City \"midwives and 'oldladies\" provided much medical care. Faced with infectious diseases, people turned to patent medicines, supplied bymany pharmacists. There were also \"pox \"elec doctors\" whospecialized invenereal herb doctors, specialized incancer and 1ung diseases. Among theregular profession competition was strong enough toenforce amodel ofhome visits and family practice.\" Atleast among the middle class, people had a personal relationship with their physicians (Rosenberg 1967: 226-231). The working class and the masses ofpoor were treated atdispen saries, byvisiting public health doctors, inhospitals, and byalterna--250 including ethnic immigrant doctors (Rosenberg 1967: 236-238). Thesuffering ill wanted medicines sophysicians often pre believing them tobecomforting ifnot therapeutic. But most ofthe drugs taken were patent medicines orhome remedies. \"Granny\" ormidwife medicine was very much apart ofwestern fron tier life. Doctors with varying degrees oftraining also practiced. But often there were nophysicians available.\" Even inurban settings new immigrants often relied ontheir own resources rather than seeking help from aphysician. Following theequilibrium model ofhealth and disease, people emphasized preventive practices. When disease needed treating, people used home remedies usually made ofcommon materials which where rubbed on, bathed in, eaten, orinhaled. Some ofthese remedies did bring relief and others received credit for thenatural disappearance ofself-limited diseases. Grannies knew some effective remedies. They used cheese mold onopen sores (penicillin derives from mold); wet tea 1eaves onburns acid solution); most folk medicines were aseffective and 1ess than patent medicines ortheheroics life, alterna tive practitioners survived professionally later into the19th-century than they had inEurope and England.

One ofthe well-known Black practitioners was Dr. Ezra Rothschild Johnson, \"The Natur a1Physician and Great Pain Annihilator\". Hehadhisoffice onWashington Street, conducted experiments with laughing gas foranesthesia inthe mid 1860s (Parker and Abajian 1974: 4). Chinese residents ofthecity had established health treatment through the Six Companies which oversaw their social and economic organization. Inthe 1860s associations based onplace usually consisting oflittle more than afewbare rooms furnished with straw mats\". They257 were allowed tooperate because thecity did not finance any medial ser- vices for the Chinese andlargely excluded them from thepublic hospital. Medical care was provided byChinese pharmacies andherbalists and ditional Chinese doctors, none ofwhom were 1icensed inthe state. Some Chinese merchants sought surgery, obstetrical orpediatric care from Caucasian physicians. But most Chinese were put off by''the language barriers, thehigher fees, andstrange medications and methods' \" (Trauner 1978: 81-82). Chinese healing became popular among white clients however, asone among many alternative approaches. W. F.Rae, travelling from England intheearly 1870s, commented on San Francisco's Chinese doctors: These with modesty oftheir powers. Atthe entrance toanalley saw projecting from side that 'Dr. Hung Lycures alldiseases up stairs.\" Inthe newspapers these doctors advertise regularly. Thus may beseen among other announcements one totheeffect that Dr. Jay Hon Chung, graduate of the highest medical college inChina, has opened an office inWashington-street: ---\"The most obstinate and painful chronic diseases treated with entire success, andcures guaranteed'\" (quoted inLewis 1962: 173). Another such Physician, cures alldiseases, internal Francisco 1877 p.1). The Langley city direc tory provided and 1879, probably because of aneditorial change (Langley). The most famous Chinese physician wasLi-po-tai, because many members ofthe white upper classes were among hispatients. Heviewed the1iver tine 1975: 240). The medical press quickly began toridicule com\u2014 petition.

Commenting that Li-po-tai had enough money toinvest incity property, theeditors related the death ofone ofhispatients. hadad reduced\" The Caucasian belief isthat consumption ismore than sufficient for the reducing process, but the Mongolian M.

About the time that hehad accomplished such amarked success inthephysical reduction ofthepatient, however, theservices oftheundertaker were required, thebuilding ofregular doctors forthis disease. Instead thepaper commented that Li-po-tai's white patients \"still crowd his rooms, fill hispockets and swallow his draughts, and heinconsequence isenabled tofeather his nest with valuable estate\" (Daily Alta California 1/2/1870: p.1,c.1). Later inthe decade his name was frequently invoked incomparison to some \"quack\" approach. For example, that one ofthe rare instances inwhich the Chinese were defended appeared inaneclectic publication. TheFamily Health Annual published ashort piece entitled \"Chinese Respect for Cerms\" in1878. Itcommented that inmost countries people pay noattention dangers offoul odors, but The 'heathen Chinee' more rational duct inthis respect. ofignoring foul smells andmalarial and other similar causes ofdisease, he elevates them tothedignity whom heworships under ofFung-Shuy. every locality where noxious odors and present. His own spot ortovacate that, he sodoes not die oftyphoid, typho malarial, orbilious fever, asdohis more civilized Christian brethren (The Family Health Annual 1878: 21). This viewpoint certainly contrasts that ofthe San Francisco Health Officer, J.L.Meares, who that year was\"rigorously condemning many of thepest pens yet over-crowded with infilth\" (San Francisco Chronicle 9/4/1878: p.2,c.3). Life inSanFrancisco was undoubtedly different for Chinese than ithad been intheir homeland. Inspite ofthecriticisms and acrimony displayed toward Chinese doctors, the public still sought their cures. James Manning Pierce wrote hissister in1869 that afemale cousin was improving under Li-po-tai's treatment. Referring tohiswife, Pierce reported that the\"celebrated Chinese physician. ..realy cured Maggie of avery bad pain inthe side which was very bad for about 2years and baffled the most skilful M.Ds, inthe city\" (Pierce 1869-1888: 8/22/1869). Asweknow from reading further letters, Mrs. Pierce continued tosuffer chronically from this mysterious pain, never diagnosed properly byChinese orCaucasian doctors. James Galloway, who lived invarious communities east ofSan Francisco during the 1870s, consulted Chinese physicians onseveral occasions. In1869 he260 wrote inhisdiary that hiswife's breast was very sore after giving birth (she eventually died ofbreast cancer): Nov. 101969 Did not much Emmas breast isgetting very sore. ...Nov 121869.

In1876 Galloway suffered from abad cold for several weeks. Hereported that he\"got some Medicin bene fit ofeither professional oralternative medical consultation. Ithas been estimated that today asmuch as70-90 per cent ofillnesses are treated byalternative forms ofhealth care (Kleinman, Eisenberg and Good 1978: 251). Onephysician today believes that folk medicine inthe19th century may have been \"objectively helpful\" fifty per cent ofthe time (Gebhard 1976: 97). Millions ofAmericans still rely onittoday (Hand 1976: 5). Empirical success must account for atleast some ofitsstaying power, inaddition tothe explanations offered earlier inthechapter. Previous chapters have already discussed theprofessional class of physicians inSan Francisco, sectarian alternatives, and patent medicines. Inthis chapter other healers and home remedies are discussed ;and inthe next chapter, clima totherapy. Ithas become clear health care toSan Franciscans inthe 1870s does notfit neatly into theconceptual categories ofprofessional, popular, and folk discus--261 sed intheIntroduction. These analytic concepts present only the perspective oftheresearcher orhistorian (the etic perspective), not that experience. Itisalso flawed innotsufficiently recognizing class differences in treatment alternatives. Any one ofthese approaches might beused by middle and upper class SanFranciscans; but the poor rarely ornever saw private physicians. Inthe face ofillness anddisease, indigenous, folk, orpopular remedies develop inevery society. Even where Western orregular medicine isthe dominant model, people still distinguish between problems which can behandled athome, through analternative healer, orthrough regular medicine. For example, Chinese residents ofSan Francisco sometimes sought Caucasian regular medicine forcertain conditions, while using Chinese medicine for therest oftheir health care. Erasmus (1977) has argued for thebasic empiricism ofsuch choices, and Gould (1957) has distinguished nonincapacitating medicine\" from incapacitating ones issought. choices beseen as\"derive sometimes been pre sented, from thesimplest home remedy through increasingly sophisticated orcomplex therapeutic strategies. Rather itisadynamic mixture of choices and actions with little ornoregard fordistinctions between professional, popular, orfolk medical nature ofanalysis topresent theseparate content ofpatent medicines, home remedies, sectarian practices, and soon. But inthe mind ofthe patient theessential concern iswith what works (Young 1976), Nineteenth century San Franciscan medical practitioners were not unusual inthe vehemency oftheir attack onalternative approaches. From the vantage point ofmodern medicine indigenous practices around the world have been regarded asannoying obstacles, or as actually productive offurther spread oraggravation ofdisease. role offolk measures inactually anthropological research (Foster and Anderson 1978: 223-262). Nineteenth century Americans developed preventive and therapeutic approaches ontheir own against therecurring epidemics ofinfectious disease. Tar and pitch, sugar, vinegar and animal skins were burned indoors and outagainst the miasms ofcholera. Gunpowder blasts were used tocleanse theatmosphere. pepper, laudanum, calomel, wine and broth were used asremedies. People also avoided becoming over heated 1968; Japp 1982). Home medical guides were used widely around the country. They were written usually byphysicians and were \"standard equipment ofmost pioneer orpack trains\". Two orPoor Man's book emphasized simple exercise, andcleanliness for good health (Brieger 1976: 1977 for and see Hecht- linger 1970 and Fellman and Fe11man 1981). The books varied inthe extent towhich they were outside regular orprofessional medicine. Most suggested variations onstandard heroic therapeutics. Some ignored such approaches andconsisted ofcollections ofhousehold remedies. In1869 George M. Beard published Our Home Physician, anexample oftheformer type, inwhich people were urged tobecome knowledgeable about scientific medicine. Frederick A.Castle took this attitude astep further in1880 with Wood's Household Practice ofMedicine, Hygiene and Surgery. People were advised totreat themselves only inemergency situations. During the 1870s and 1880s patent medicines increasingly substituted fortraditional home remedies orkitchen medicines 1977). But people made syrups, soporifics, cathartics, emetics andabortifacients from numerous plants and herbs. medically effective drugs originated inthis way: quinine, orcamphor oralive spider worn in abag around the neck. Sliced onions inthe bedroom orone inthe pocket were believed effective. Numerous herbal concoctions were prepared, along Thomsonian 1\u00ednes (Dunlop 1965: 185-191; Jones 1967: 263). Early evidence ofthekinds ofhome remedies people brought with them to the West isfound inAmos Batchelder's diary and commonplace book. Hecame toSan Francisco during the Gold Push with the following among his medical prescriptions: Phthisis Pulmonalis: B10od zinc, digitalis, gives hesays Place anounce ofcream oftartar insixteen ounces of water and take atablespoonful three times aday, and you may sleep with asmall poxpatient with perfect im punity. Ifevery citizen would dothis forfifteen days there would be an end tosmall pox inanycity\" (Batchelder 1835-1849). Suggestions were not much different inthe 1870s. Western settlers often kept journals and scrapbooks that had home remedies inthem. For example, the scrapbook kept byMollie Watson Hill ofDayton, Oregon contained recipes forspecific home remedies along with news items, poetry, family events, jokes andstories. Among the remedies forin fectious diseases she recorded the following (often taken from news papers); Atea made ofdried whortleberries, and ficulty, however bad Atea leaves for fever and ASure anhour Local application forerysipelas -acetate oflead, from fever, theconsumption ofher typhoid fever ofseveral friends (Hill aselsewhere toillness typically anempirical, trial-and-error combination ofherbal cures, patent medicines, doctor's prescriptions, home medical manual advice, and talismans. This eclectic mix isnotsurprising, given that regular phys icians acknowledged their helplessness inthe ofepidemics, andself help avalued part of19th-century American ideology. Early settlers inthe Bay Area had torely onself help. Helen D'Apery recalled that her mother was always called upon during illnesses inOak land inthe 1850s. There was nodoctor available \"until good, capable, blunt old Dr. Gibbons settled there\" (D'Apery 1872: 405). Apopular plasters orapplications ofredflannel. Theeclectic Family in1878. Asitz bath and blankets were tobeused tocause perspiration; then the head and body sponged and hot and cold compresses offlannel cloths used alternately along with lemon juice onmouth sores and avinegar andwater gargle (Family Health Annual 1878: 28-29). Margaret Pierce's hissister during thefirst year bis marriage: Iamquite aphysician now for Maggie has asore throat for thelast six weeks and have been using all sorts of remedies.

Years later Mrs. Pierce wrote ofher child: Elliott has not been very well for aweek past &Dr. Burgess (Pierce 1869-1888: 12/14/1881). Mrs. Pierce had had mustard appliations many years before for her heart pains (Pierce (Stein 1878-1884: 1/8/1886). James Galloway used in1871 1/20/1871). Richard Stanwood also reported the hisbrother-in-law Hannah Ingalls participated when adressing onthe chest and mustard water were used for her brother's bilious attack: Mrs. Bourn could think ofnothing she could dobut give him mustard water and Iput adress upon his chest and suggested aninjection and she got one ofthegirls up and heated some water and hetook itthree removed for hewasstill in great distress, but vomiting relieved him for atime, then the pain was assevere asever. . ..Willie Bourn went for thedoctor, hedid not get here until nine. The doctor gave castor oil and hethrew itupand a great deal ofbile with it. Herepeated the dose and after atime gave know what the\"injections\" used inthis case were. The doctor recommended another common home remedy, castor oil. Mrs. Stein often used itfor herchildren. Stanwood's267 daughter, Bessie, was given oil when sheapparently swallowed a button (Stanwood 1852-1884: 4/22/1879). One ofthe codliver oil: and hope when you come home\" (Pierce 1869-1888: 3/9/1875). Onanother occasion Mrs. Pierce gave her son molasses vinegar and water for anearly morning attack ofcroup (Pierce 1869-1888: 3/18/1877). Richard Stanwood's 1852-1884: were used inanumber ofremedies. Mrs. Stein gave Gertrude some tea for her hives (Stein 1878-1884: 3/11/1884). Mrs. Pierce received \"anice little salt bagfull ofcat-nip\" from heraunt. She gave her baby some inhisbottle and\"it broke his cold right away: itissonice and green &fresh!\" (Pierce 1869-1888: 12/18/1874). While visiting in Boston afew years later, Mrs. Pierce reported, Frank and Minerva are asusual. Frank has had asevere attack ofsore throat, which wealmost feared might be diptheria, which has been raging inBoston and Maine, in fact inNew England almost asviolently asinSanFran cisco --but Minerva doctored him with herbs, days; and though hecoughsstill, isbetter (Pierce 1869-1888: Hannah wrote her husband when shefirst arrived inSan Francisco in1865 that she Joseph Newmark was faced with afour-week-old child with whooping cough intheearly 1870s: \"We gave him goat milk; hecould not take theother. Then his whole lower body became sosore; itwaspiti ful, what thechild suffered. thechild much good\" (Newmark 1900: 9).\" When his son Eddie may have contracted whooping cough from a friend, and had been coughing forthree months, Richard Stanwood cured him: \"finally Idosed tea apre scription inthe Frugal (Stanwood 1852-1884: 1/5/1880). Itisunlikely that any ofthese home remedies more, orless, curative than was \"doctor medicine\". Inmany cases there was anoverlap between the two. The home remedies withstood because, ifnotcurative, they had proved tobepalliative. Local regular physicians explained thepopularity and success of home remedies much asthey dotoday. Dr. F.

Hatch neglected torealize that what hedescribed was also the approved empiricism ofthe regular profession. Hedid see theconnection between self-limited illness the attribution ofcure that has sooften been noticed bymedical anthropologists studying alternative healing. But these rational explanations did not address thedesperation and anxiety ofthose seeking cures.

Presumably theeditors presented such items toridicule folk beliefs, but thepiteous nature oftheaction is what iscommunicated. Summary Chapter Thirteen People have always relied onthe reassurance ofhaving faith in healing powers. The doctor orhealer reinforces this faith byritualiz ing theinteraction with his orherpatient. Many midwives or\"old 1adies\" provided care inthe19th-century. They may have been gentler intheir ministrations, cheaper, and more readily available. People also trusted their traditional herbs andreputations. One such \"old lady\" reputation for hercures, butitwasshort-lived. California became acenter foralternative medical in uncertainties ofthe 1870s. Itwas hoped that personal fate would sur mount social conditions. Metaphysical healing ormind cure was also a popular panacea forphysical andpsychological problems. The use of \"blue glass\" became practice during the 1870s, capital izing onbelief inmystical powers. Many upper and middle class residents ofSan Francisco consulted several Chinese practitioners such asLi-po-tai. The regular profession railed against this practice, but white patients nevertheless continued tosee Chinese doctors. Most illnesses were treated athome without any270 consultation. People relied ontraditional home remedies. Specific preventive and therapeutic remedies were directed atdevastating in fectous diseases. Home medical guides were widely available, and many people made uptheir own, filling scrapbooks with medical recipes derived from both oral tradition andprint. Self help was necessary even ina community with somany physicians because people could notafford tohire adoctor every time afamily member became ill. Among the common reme-- dies used were mustard plasters, hot and cold compresses, castor oil and cod liver oil, and herbal preparations. There were overlaps iningredients with the medicines used by physicians. Inneither case were they much more effective than thepro vision ofsymptom alleviation. Both types ofmedicine were credited with curative powers when thepatient recovered. But often the real explan ation lay intheself-limited nature oftheillness. Endnotes Chapter contemporaries todescribe all laymen (or women!) whoroutinely provided remedies intheir communi allphysicians did the (Rosenberg 1967). *The \"hierarchy ofresort\" described anthropologists inwhich based onthecultural andetiologi cal explanation ofthe disease may have here aprofound emotional exper ience, involving symptoms that inspire awe and fear and signify spiritual power, and/or receiving adivine call through adream, trance, or hallucination\" (Landy 1977: noquestions suggests adivine gift. *Inaddition tosuch Francisco ofClairvoyant Reading andPsychic Spiritual Healing, acouple who doClairvoyant and Tarot Readings, a store that sells crystal balls and other \"powerful specimens\", a homeopathic health clinic, and anarticle explaining homeopathy (Life style Nov. 1982; Whole Life Times Nov. 1982; Whole Life Times SanFran cisco Supplement Oct/Nov. 1982). \"Blue glass treatment was invented byGeneral Augustus J.Pleasanton, a Philadelphia lawyer who began experiments with itin1860, and found it tobeeffective against \"neuralgia. ..failing appetite. ..falling hair, rheumatism... even tuberculosis crystals today.

As amixture itwascalled Black (Roper 1974, Livingstone's Pocket Medical Dictionary).273 CHAPTER FOURTEEN: CLIMATOTHERAPY Climate and Consumption There were still other courses ofaction available tosick residents ofSan Francisco inthe 1870s. They could take advantage ofachange of scene. Ecological setting figured much more prominently inbeliefs about disease etiology inthe19th-century than itdoes today. Both medical professionals and laypublic regarded climate, season, geography, and topography ascausative ofdisease. They believed that patterns ofdis\u2014 ease incidence varied with location and season. Since climate and loca tion retained such astrong place inetiological beliefs, itwas natural that they were interpreted intherapeutics aswell. People regarded the West andCalifornia inparticular asalocation offering great health benefits. This reputation survives today and accounts for theorigin ofmany alternative health approaches inthis state (Baur 1959). Many California physicians studied and wrote treatises onthefinest details oflocal climatic and geographic conditions. The geographer Kenneth Thompson has made astudy ofclimatotherapy inCalifornia. He says that the medical authors ofthe time universally agreed astothe state's healthful andtherapeutic climatic phenomena\", relying onpoor climatic andmortality data. Thompson concludes that cures occurred pro bably because ofmisdiagnoses, psychosomatic causes, orthe'natural healing force' Some physicians disagreed with climatotherapy. In1876 aletter was published locally from aColorado doctor who argued against theclaims ofclimatotherapy. Hecomplained, correctly, that not enough was known274 toclaim that certain localities cured phthisis. Herecommended any change ofclimate and improved hygiene for those inearly stages. But hefelt that those inadvanced stages ofthedisease should stay put (PMSJ was the prime disease inclimatotherapy Jones 1967). Henry Gibbons, Sr. attempted anexamination oftheeffects ofSanFrancisco's climate onbronchial and pulmonary problems. He argued that the sea breeze inthis ocean climate was invigorating and swept away diseases, even though itbothered invalids. Similarly, the fog and winds ofthecity bothered ill people, but did not harm them. Hesaw many such invalids recover inthecity; but herecommended that pulmonary consumptives spend winter and spring insouthern California and only summer inSan Francisco. Additionally, herecommended anout door life for them (Gibbons 1875). In1878 the City Health Officer wrote ofSanFrancisco: \"Our location, our trade winds, our long dry season, and uniform low temperature, inspite ofour disregard ofsanitary 1aws, are theprovidential safeguards ofthe epidemics which afflict our Eastern cities\" (San Municipal 1877- 1878: 228). Inconsequence ofthis reputation, thecity became amecca (as did southern California later) fortuberculosis sufferers. Nonetheless, some visitors disagreed. MacGregor was one ofthe singled out malaria rather than tuber culosis asthesickness ofthis city, although henoted too that thecli275 mate was bad for consumptives. Leading physicians were concerned through the 1870s about theex cess oftuberculosis patients inSan consumptives. Itsuggested that those stages inthe mountains inthe summer, ahorseback orsea journey suited some; but the San Francisco winds were too cold fordelicate fe males and those inadvanced stages ofthedisease. Likewise, thein terior ofthe state was too hot. The writer said that the counties north ofSanFrancisco were too much \"abattle-ground between the twoclimates, inwhich wind and mist onthe ontheother, triumph alternately\". Herecommended theareas tothe south around Los Angeles and San Diego for the most equable climate (PMSJ Dec. 1870 No. 43: toCalifornia wasdistorting health statistics. Discussing death rates Thomas Logan noted that, here, aswell asinSanta salubrity (Logan same problem inSanFrancisco in 1875. Herecommended that those intheincipient stage ofconsumption travel around, treating themselves with outdoor life, or\"camping out\", exercising andeating wholesome food (Gibbons 1875: 235-242). In1878 Gibbons argued that somany patients with pulmonary con sumption filled the City and County Hospital that admission had tobe refused those notactually bedridden. Most came from out ofstate and276 incurred great cost tothecity. Even those who improved bytheir hospi tal stay were frustrated inpermanent cure bythe climate ofthecity, Gibbons said. Hecalled for for Consumptives away ocean winds: \"Anestablishment ofthis kind would save thelives ofmany who now drift from all parts oftheState into the inclement climate of themetropolis, that thehospital onapavilion plan take advantage ofoutdoor life (Gibbons 1878a). In1879 John S.Hittell endorsed Gibbons' call for astate hospital for consumptives. Discussing the great expense toSan Francisco ofthese patients, heargued that many died because the climate was unfavorable to them. Bynowitwasclear that the claimed general \"salubrity\" ofSan Francisco early inthe decade did not apply tothose suffering from tuber culosis asthe decade ended. Hittell ahighly pernicious influence\". Itwas and diseases. Herecommended amountain near thenorthern town ofSt. Helena asanideal place for a state consumptive hospital, since theinterior and the coast were both undesirable (Hittell 1879: 498-504). This recommendation was confirmed byDr. James Blake, who lived inthese mountains. Hesuggested an elevation of2000-4000 feet amid pine forests Aninteresting sideline with SanFrancisco's climate anditseffect ondisease was the movement toplant eucalyptus trees. These trees were introduced from Australia asearly as1850, andpraised fortheir medicinal andanti-malarial qualities and W.P.Gibbons wrote articles in1875 describing the value ofthese trees, how toplant and use them. The strong medicinal277 odor ofthe trees undoubtedly produced thebelief that they could clear the air ofmiasms. Atincture ofthe leaves was also recommended as a remedy formalaria. The trees were also expected toabsorb standing water and prevent itsproduction ofmiasms (Logan 1875; bind. Onthe one hand, they extolled thecity's climate asahealthy one, freer ofin fectious disease than most other cities (see Chapter Five). Onthe other hand, thereputation ofthecity, and thestate, brought ahuge influx oftubercular patients, health facilities. icians were forced todeclare thecity climate dangerous forsufferers ofthis disease. The presence ofmalarial patients inthecity was less dramatic because productive oflower mortality rates. Butsufferers from chills and fever retreated toSan Francisco from thestate's inter ior torecover from this disease aswell. Country Retreats and Spas Itisnotsurprising that California quickly gained thereputation itretains today for healthy outdoor life. There was aprevalent 'climate' ofsuch ideas inthelate 19th-century, emphasizing attitude, called inEngland \"muscular Christianity\". Healthy body andhealthy mind were clearly equated. Members ofthe middle and upper classes formed walking clubs and prided themselves oncovering many miles daily orweekly, much as joggers dotoday (Haley 1978). In1877 Sr. presented that was so278 influential itwas commented upon later bythe medical press (see PMSJ 1877 XX(7): suffering from pulmonary organs\". Relating various tales ofpeople ofhisacquaintance who regained their health bycamping out inthe mountains ortaking upfarm labor, Gibbons endorsed California's climate forthis treatment. He stressed that there was nosingle climate inthestate, locally for orthe foot-hills ofAlameda County across the bay south, orthe 10w toand from these locations, with thediversions ofthetrip, could be its most beneficial attribute, hesaid. Hesuggested specific equip ment andactivities for camping out, recommending asojourn ofamonth tosix weeks. Heargued that camping out was cheaper than going toone ofthespas. Supplying one's needs was easy, for game andfish were plentiful and butter and milk could beobtained from local farmers. Women oftheparty could dothe cooking. Gibbons remarked onhow many San Franciscans could profit from such anexcursion: Among men, dyspepsia and'biliousness' co-operate for evil with thetoil ofbusiness. Among women, nervous affections inendless forms, anddebility from nursing orwant ofout-door exercise have stomach orbowels, orthey arecon tinually taking cold (Gibbons 1877: onGibbons' ideas in1879 nerve apparatus279 ascamping out inthemountains\" (Blake 1879: 437). Fully advocating the mountain climate for consumptives, Blake pointed out that there were still some problems inarranging accomodations and \"good, wholesome food\". Living inthese mountains himself, hefound hehadtrouble obtaining eggs, butter and milk, and had tosend toSan Francisco for meat. Ifconsumptives did not get anadequate diet, andifthey camped inlow places where itwas hotter inthe daytime and cooler and damper atnight, thebeneficial effects ofcamping out would bedefeated (Blake 1879). About ten years later Dr. Clemens Richter reported the case ofa tubercular woman hetreated bythe camping out approach. Hesent her to the Santa Barbara foothills where she lived in atent with her mother for twoyears. Her lungs were completely cured, and she devoted thirty more years oflife, hewas sorry tosay, toChristian Science. Nonethe less, heattributed her cure more tothe camping out (Richter 1922: 34-35).\" Inthediaries andletters San The young engineer Edward Howe found that the winds and fog of San Francisco affected his tendency tobiliousness and dyspepsia, sohe moved toOakland forrelief and enjoyed outings climbing Mount Tamalpais (Howe 1872-1873). B.E.Lloyd praised Oakland and other outlying regions afewyears later, exclaiming, \"Are you weary ofcity life, and require the mountain air toinvigorate your frame? Scale the summit of Mount Diablo lAre youill, and need the waters and the midwest which affected hisliver. Hesought outdoors employ ment rather than adesk job, and atleast initially enjoyed the manual labor hedid inEureka in1871.

Hereported five months later that she had improved. Similarly, Lucy Jones, ayoung lady ingood society, reported among her innumerable acquaintances in1875 ayoung woman visiting for her health from Boston. Shebrought along asix-year-old girl \"who isvery delicate\". The plan tokeep this child for ayear, even giving hertheir name for the time, \"to seeifthePacific Ocean airwill strengthen her\". Her mother back East was \"very delicate also and may possibly spend next winter here\" (Jones 1874-1875: 5/29/1875). Among her many other illacquaintances (and itisremarkable how many there were !)was awoman who had been thrown from ahorse years before and never recovered from severe back pain. She went toLytton Springs281 for herhealth (Jones these letters isthat Chinese household servants inSan Francisco also apparently retired tohot springs fortheir health. Miss Jones complained in1874 that \"Yin was taken sick and went away today\". Shortly thereafter hewasreplaced byanother \"chinaboy\" todo the household work. Several other Chinese servants came and went before Yin's return three months later: who should come inbut'Yin'. hehad been very sick again. went toNapa. was there for his health four weeks. isquite well now.

Unfortunately, three months later Yin took sick again and was replaced byhis cousin. Mrs. Joseph Newmark's autobiography describes several retreats to San Rafael forhealth reasons. Inthe 1860s herinfant daughter became ill with continuous diarrhea. The anxiety and work ofcaring for her made itimpossible for Mrs. Newmark towork inthe family store: Iwas very ill and had abad cough which did not seem togetbetter soSan Rafael was recommended for me and thechild. Iwas packed amid blankets into a carriage and taken over. Ihad agood German maid who went along for the child and mygood sister and her 1ittle boy also (Newmark 1900: 8). They all stayed with alandlady inthe Marin County town. She offered tonurse Mrs. Newmark's daughter who was notreceiving enough nourishment from herill mother. Because theclimate was sogood inSanRafael, they remained for afew months. Afew years later, after she had had two more children, Mrs. Newmark again retreated toSan Rafael when all three had whooping cough : The doctor came daily but could donothing for the282 poor children. Mypoor Samy was theworst; hecould not swallow anything for four weeks; his throat had become so bad. Sothe doctor said achange ofair might bethe best. Said, done; Isaw that wecould not wait. When the doctor had gone, Ihad the maid wash thenecessary linen, made thenecessary preparations for thetrip: We went toSan Rafael (Newmark 1900: 9). Two ofher children improved, herdaughter still coughing, but \"otherwise 1ively and happy that she could beout ofdoors all day\". The way in which herinfant son was cured has been described inaprevious chapter. When Mrs. Newmark herself wasill and awaiting anoperation, she rode the Geary Street car toGolden Gate Park for adaily outing recommended byher doctor, inaddition tofrequently eating steaks (Newmark 1900: 12). Mrs. Margaret Pierce described several retreats tothe country inher letters. She wrote her sister-in-law in1869 that her cousin who had previously tried Li-po-tai's treatment had now gone toabrother's in Vallejo. Shesaid, \"Ibelieve inhim. . . .perhaps this climate will doagreat hope itwill for Ilike hervery much\" (Pierce 1869-1888: 10/10/1869). weak andfeeble\" atthe news of hersister's death, andretreated toVallejo again. This move was appar-- ently unsuccessful, for two months later sheleft for Los Angeles tosee another brother. Mrs. Pierce commented, \"I've nodoubt will enjoy her self, and improve too, inthe warm pleasant climate\" (Pierce 1869-1888: 2/8/1870, 4/16/1870). In1873 Mrs. Pierce herself retreated tothe country inSanta Clara. She was run down from being overactive, andsuffering from her old com plaints: \"Ilost myappetite, grew very pale &thin, and James getting frightened, sent usoff tothecountry\". Herleisure activities there cured her (Pierce 1869-1888: 7/22/1873). The next year her aunt Mary283 with whom they lived, had twostrokes ofapoplexy and was sent tothe country torecuperate (Pierce 1869-1888: 6/24/1874). Health resorts orspas became increasingly popular inCalifornia from the 1870s into the20th-century. Among those within reasonable distance from San Francisco were Byron Springs 68miles away; Calistoga, Cloverdale, Napa Soda Springs, and White Sulphur Springs inNapa County approximately 50miles north ofthecity; and California Geysers, Lytton Selzer Springs, Santa Rosa White Sulphur Springs, and Skagg's HotSprings inSonoma County approximately 100 miles north. Smaller local spas in cluded Piedmont White Sulphur Springs inthe Berkeley Hills. Each spa advertised several kinds ofmineral waters fordrinking, aswell as special baths, douches, mud baths and exercises. These treatments were regarded asbeneficial especially fordyspepsia; kidney, bowel and stomach problems; alcoholism, malaria, syphilis, rheumatism, scrofula, gout, arthritis, liver problems, glandular and skin diseases (Chittenden 1881; Anderson 1890; see also Hatch 1871; State Board ofHealth, Second Bien nial Report... 1873; State Board ofHealth, Sixth Report... 1880). Several ofthese spas were especially popular among well-to-do ofthe 1870s. Imentioned awoman who earlier inthis chapter. Itswaters were ad vertised much later for the treatment ofthe diseases listed above. At its sanitarium 70miles from San Francisco malaria was unknown, according tothis ad. Treatments for many ailments featured hydrotherapy: electric, vapor, Turkish, Russian and Roman baths; \"fomentations\", packs, douches, oxygen treatment and \"Manual and Swedish movements\" (Lytton Springs Sani tarium Co. 1896). Another popular spa was White Sulphur Springs, where friends report284 edin1869 that two women were \"sporting amid therustic scenes\". But one ofthem was (Pierce went son and Springs, struck bythe number of\"watering places\" they passed. Each provided hotel rooms with meals aswell as separate cottages. Calistoga Springs could accomodate 200guests. She described the \"swimming bath\" dark incolor because ofthe iron content her inaRussian bath: Iskrewed mycourage uptothehighest pitch, but began toperspire quite freely before Ihad half undressed, and upon opening the door ofthe1ittle room Iwas so covered with the vapor Ibegan tofeel Ihad had enough .. ..The opening for the steam was about ahalf ayard square and there were slats across, but the water came very near tothe top, and steam sohot Icould not stand it, when itoccurred been myhead out ofthe window, (there isalittle window ineach room) and Ifound I could not only breathe easier but stand more heat.

These health spas were really resorts where people went toenjoy the novelty of19th-century \"hot tubs\", pleasant climate and good meals,285 asmuch astorecover from illness. Summary Chapter Fourteen Both physicians and people ingeneral regarded climate and geography asinstrumental inthe causes and cures ofdisease. The climate of California was regarded asespecially healthful. Invalids regularly made excursions tohealth spas and country retreats. Some doctors advocated \"camping out\" asagenerally invigorating andrestorative activity. The climate ofSan Francisco was regarded asboth helpful and dangerous tohealth, depending onthewriter. The winds, moderate temperatures, and long dry season were lauded while the same winds, damp and fog were criticised. Tuberculosis was the disease singled out inmost discussions of climatotherapy and opinions varied astothe best locations forits treatment. Itwas pretty much universally recommended that consumptives leave thecity itself where they were distorting health statistics. Thesalubrity ofthecity did not extend totuberculosis victims. To improve its climate formalaria sufferers eucalyptus trees were planted throughout thecity. Their aroma was regarded ashealthful forclear middle and upper class people went tothe country ortospas such as White Sulphur Springs when they were ill. Even Chinese servants were known togotothe country when they became ill.286 Endnotes Chapter Fourteen 'Eucalyptus trees still bank the rear ofSan Francisco General Hospital today, protecting itfrom automobile exhaust fumes from thepassing freeway. *Dr. Richter introduced the damaging Weir Mitchell rest cure forhyster ical women toCalifornia. Hecommented that the Queen ofTahiti was hispatient, and she said that rest cure was traditional there. Her understanding ofrest cure was obviously subject tocultural rein terpretation. What she described was young women being banished toan island tomake them more desireable formarriage ontheir return (see also Wood 1973: 25-52).287 CONCLUDING PERSPECTIVES Yesterday and Today: Some Connections Nineteenth-century with life. But acentury ago people ofallclasses lived inthepresence of devastating infections. Principal causes ofdeath between 1800 and 1875 were pulmonary tuberculosis (the single greatest cause ofdeath over the past 200years), infant diarrheal diseases, bacillary dysentery, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and lobar pneumonia. Great epidemics ofcholera, smallpox and yellow fever diseases, physicians 19th-century San Francisco struggled tocontrol not only thediseases them\u2014 selves, but also theexclusive right tointerpret, define andtreat them. Contemporary medical ideology revealed much about social changes occur ring inanindustrializing and urbanizing city. Asthe medical profession endeavored tocircumscribe the causes and outcomes ofinfectious disease, its victims sought different interpretations and therapies. People common 1ymade use ofalternative practitioners and popular and folk remedies. There isastriking analogy between the 1870s andpresent-day medical practices inthe San Francisco Bay Area. Today acute infectious diseases nolonger have great significance. Eighty per cent ofdiseases today are chronic rather than acute, compared tothirty per cent fifty years ago (Public Affairs Research Group 1981, report two: 237-256). But heart disease, cancer and other chronic andstress--related ailments288 again present baffling etiologies and often ineffective therapeutic responses. Because ofthis ambiguity, alternative medical ideologies have again acquired great popularity. Many ofthem have inturn simply been revived from previous forms. For example, arecent wholistic health periodical fatures ahistory ofherbal medicine and numerous advertise ments forits modern proponents (Whole Life Times 1983). Itadvertises acupuncture, nutripathy, herbal anddietary cures, massage, \"synergy\", homeopathy, yoga, meditation, astrology, biofeedback, Ayurvedic medicine, Chinese herbs, naturopathic medicine, and many others. Asin19th-cen- tury San Francisco, homeopaths still sell home medicine kits. Nutri pathy would undoubtedly appeal to19th-century eclectics with its combi\u2014 ofapproaches including metabolic typing, therapy, re flexology, acupressure, flower formulas, massage, herbology, nutrient therapy and mental Magnetism isstill advertised rheumatism andinfections. touse term \"allopathic\" toplace regular physicians ina status equivalent toalternative practitioners. Local hotsprings ad vertise saunas, The focus isnolonger oninfectious, andespecially venereal diseases. Now cancer, stress dis eases such ashigh blood pressure, chronic back problems, digestive prob lems, gynecological diseases and general maintenance advertisements. Butself-help isemphasized asitwas inthe 19th-century. Today mail-order cassettes home manuals (Whole Life Times April/May 1983).289 This newpopularity ofalternative health scientific medicine. Illness isculturally constructed, de fined anddealt with. When theexplanations ofone system become un satisfactory, others arise toreplace oralter it. Even today when sci entific medicine wields greater power than anyother modern profession, itscultural authority can bechallenged bynewsocial definitions of disease. Recognizing this reality, theusually conservative American Medical Association has recently lifted itscentury-old ban onconsulta tions andreferrals between its members andalternative practitioners such aschiropractors and homeopaths. The medical law that ended the decade ofthe 1870s inCalifornia has been elaborated andrefined inintervening years. Recently the California Board ofMedical Quality Assurance has suggested greater flexibility intheregulation ofmedical practice diagnosing, andinserting instruments beyond body orifices\". Alternative practitioners could not perform these actions; although acupuncture andchiropractic X-rays are already permitted. Alternative practitioners' other activities would thus beboth 1jimited andlegiti mized. They would berecognized, but would face stricter penalties for overstepping these newly defined boundaries. Physicians thought ofthe 1876 law inasimilar way: its purpose was toclearly define and exclude alternative practitioners from the290 legitimated realm ofregular practice (see Chapter Twelve). Many today retain amarketplace argument incontrast tothis attempt toregulate They feel they have aright toremain unregulated entrepreneurs inafree society. But they donot recognize that they are nolonger thefree competitors ofthe19th-century, but instruments ofbureaucratic andcorporate control. Some medical sociologists and health activists have argued that medical licensing isnolonger the crucial issue inatime when the dominant profession has enormous poli tical and economic power toshape how wethink about health andillness. This isourcentral reality today because cultural authority, buttressed bybureaucratic power, isthe prime shaping force atwork inadvanced industrial society (Public Affairs Research Group 1981; Starr 1982; Whole Life Times April/May 1983: 10,29). Medical ofacentury ago were successful ines tablishing hegemony and wresting control from alternative practices primarily because their efforts coincided with the remarkable discoveries that followed upon theintroduction ofbacteriology, Inthe next century most ofthe killer diseases discussed inthis work were eliminated from ordinary experience. Some, such asmalaria, were eliminated from North America. Others, notably smallpox, were eliminated altogether. The drama ofthis change can beillustrated bythe decrease bymore than 50 per cent inAmerica's infant mortality rate intheearly 20th-century. Inreality however, only those physicians who engaged insanitation and public health work contributed tothedecline ininfectious diseases. Most ofthese diseases had already demonstrated their diminution prior tothe discovery ofantibiotics, astheresult ofimproved nutri tion, hygiene, andgeneral public health. The strength ofscientific291 medical ideology was such that credit for the amazing elimination ofthese diseases from ordinary 1ife accured tomedical therapeutics ofeach ofthese disease discovery ofantibiotics andantiseptic techniques assured faith inthecurative abilities ofregular medicine. The popular cultural ideology ofhealth and disease was totally redefined. Diseases became reified entities representing anobjective \"otherness\" that seizes hold ofbodies. People came toexpect ailments with single identifiable causes, tobecured after the fact bythe drug therapies orsurgeries ofscien tific medicine. The equilibrium and almost \"object intrusion\". Causation nolonger entirely replaced byanotion of rested inpersonal and social responsibility, but occurred randomly, unpredictably anduncontrollably. Scientific medicine was the only hope forcure. Although public health and hygiene against germs (the intruders) became ritualized andculturally affirmed asaway of1jife, little asimproved nutri tion and avoidance ofenvironmental dangers. Nineteenth-century social recognized multifactorial social etiologies and sources ofdisease inclass differences. But this model was replaced byscientific explanations, based according toone physician on\"amindless application ofmolecular biology\". Even though this movement away from asocial causation ideology ofdisease took place, cultural explanatory constructions ofdisease continue tochange. As people have become more disappointed with theimpossibility ofinstant cures and sure definitions ofchronic diseases that now dominate, they have begun torevive social explanatory models. Preventive health care has become increasingly emphasized asaway toavoid heart disease,292 cancer, arthritis, and other chronic afflictions. Itmay well happen that attention toprevention will indeed eliminate these diseases asit apparently affected infectious diseases acentury ago. Again, themedi calprofession will infact cure only aminority ofpeople who happen to become ill because ofunavoidable environmental exposures, orbecause ofpoor personal health maintenance (see Dubos 1959; Engelhardt 1974; McKeown 1979; Public Affairs Research Group 1981, Report Two: 42). The real conquest ofcurrent ambiguities indisease mayparallel that ofin fectious diseases; i.e., itwill place outside the medical pro fession. Health statistics in1870s San Francisco revealed many deaths from cancer and heart disease. The classes of\"constitutional\" and \"local\" idseases incontemporary disease nosology accounted for People died from cancer aswell ascon sumption, and from heart, brain, and organ failures. But these diseases were overshadowed bythe more frightening and dramatic \"fevers\". Alter native healers are most successful intreatment ofchronic, non-life threatening diseases, just asregular medicine has been most successful inquick antibiotic cures ofacute infections. Incases ofchronic dis ease orself-limited infections that have not received antibiotic treat \"inethno ment, thesuccessful healer treats \"illness\" not\"disease medical terms. Therituals involved inhis orher healing activities assume great importance, for they provide asocial explanation that alle viates thepatient's psychological stress andmetaphysical doubt. The great appeal of19th-century homeopathy, herbal cures, patent medicines, magnetic treatment andhydrotherapy (and oftheir offshoots today) lay inthepatient's inclusion inthesocial participation ofhealing. People293 faced with stresses, environmental pressures and undefined poor health today find attractive for the same reason the approaches of\"self programming\", both in1870s San Francisco and inthe present time, theanalyst can uncover theattitudes and expectations that give authority toone form ofhealing over another. Successful healers appeal tothe experience ofillness with allitsassociated culturally defined features. The whole life experience oftheillper son comes into play inhis orher expression ofillness. Being ill has psychological, familial, occupational andfinancial implications, among Inseeking treatment, theill person tobehealed both byindividuals and society. invarious in San Francisco acquired immune deficiency icians today have been deliberately trained toignore inconsultations with patients all such social explanations ofdisease and tofocus solely onits\"objective\" features. Alternative therapists however, mayspecifically treat social andpsychological causation, either directly orindirectly through the symbolism ofritual. Nineteenth century eclectic physicians proposed anassortment ofhealing activi- ties, including attention to\"lifestyle\" behaviors, mentally and physically soothing therapeutics, improved hygiene anddiet andother approaches over their ownfates byencouraging self diagnosis and treatment. Patent medicines and herbal home remedies also provided people with asense ofself-determination. The sometimes exotic etiological explanations offered byalternative healers were no more inaccurate than those ofregular physicians inthe19th-century. Patent medicine adsdirectly referred tothebehavioral excesses toresult indisease. Alternative practitioners continue tooffer this wholistic approach today, while regular medicine seeks bacterial, viral, genetic orother single causes tobeeliminated by\"magic bullets\". Medical anthropology offers acombination ofperspectives that serve toexplain not only the popularity ofalternative medical practice during both these time per iods, but also abasis forunderstanding the larger social changes that occurred inthecultural construction ofdisease over thepast century. The ethnomedical model provides aninitial perspective for the first ofthese tasks, the conceptual distinction between disease and illness epitomizes thegreat gap between from that seen inthehospital ordoctor's office. Inthe19th century asinpresent-day San Francisco one's body andone's definition ofhealth isvery important topeople. The present medical system has lost touch with this key philosophic and psychological reality because ofits great success intechnological in tervention inacute disease episodes. The ethnomedical approach has ahighly individualized focus, odd for asocial theory. Other anthropologists, sociologists andhistorians add thecontributions of1arger social forces tocultural construction of disease theory. Medical practices areideological because they exist inalarger context ofconflicting social relations. Inthe19th-century industrialization inthe Western world brought about profound economic changes with accompanying population movements and new social arrange ments. Thealteration and growth ofurban environments inparticular produced changed and increased disease incidence and prevalence. San Francisco isaninteresting community toexamine inthis regard because itwas the only sizeable urban setting onthedeveloping West Coast of this period, and thedestination Thecity and into the 1880s public health conditions that had already occurred inmajor European cities since the 1830s orbefore. There thesanitary reform movement was well under way andsocial medicine had become adominant ideological position. Asanew andisolated American city, SanFrancisco clung toolder health values and moved only very slowly towards public health solutions. About the time such approaches were recognized, the296 bacteriological revolution took place, altering the whole nature of infectious disease medicine. SanFrancisco, then acity oftemporary housing andprimitive public works, was swept forces ofchange. Asudden and exponential growth inpopulation occurred atthe same time that the nature ofwork changed, producing massive unemployment. Thedestitution andmiserable living conditions ofSanFrancisco's immigrant classes may not have been asshocking asearlier reports from cities such asNew York. But they were sufficiently bad tocreate high rates ofalcoholism, venereal disease, suicide andother indicators ofsocial disruption and pessimism. Members ofthe upper classes expressed common social values ofthe time, allaying any sense oftheir ownpersonal responsibility by beliefs inthe immorality ofothers asthe source ofdisease. Blatant class and ethnic prejudices were expressed incontemporary writing, especially against Chinese residents ofthecity. The Irish-born who suffered such calumny inother American cities were largely spared itin San Francisco even though they appeared heavily instatistics ofpoverty, disease, and death. Few American physicians ofthis period were able toenvision the role that epidemiology was eventually toplay inthe documentation of health and disease. Thecollection ofvital statistics was severely limited. But SanFrancisco health officers compared thecity's mortal ityrates tothose ofother cities inthe nation and world. They assured thepublic inevery report that San Francisco was thehealthiest of cities. Etiological and social beliefs dictated certain choices inthe interpretation ofhealth statistics, asthey dotoday. Three sources of health aberrance were singled out. Those concerned with public health wrote continually ofthedeplorable state ofthecity's sewage system.297 The predominant miasmatic theory because oftheir alien andimpoverished way of1jife. Actually, statistics ontheir health conditions were so poor astobetotally inconclusive. Finally, some physicians were con cerned that San Francisco was becoming ahealth mecca fortuberculosis sufferers andidentified that kind ofimmigration asresponsible for increased disease prevalence. While each ofthese sources ofdisease existed inthecity, none ofthem could have had thesignificance assigned them atthe time. Examination ofSan Francisco health statistics demonstrates who the ill and dying really were and what diseases they suffered. About 45 per cent ofdeaths inthecity each year were among theforeign-born, which corresponded ofthecity population. Fre quently athird were among theIrish. With 35-45 per cent ofalldeaths each year being ofchildren under the age often, itisclear that many younger members ofimmigrant families were ill and dying. These children died ofinfectious diseases. The crowded and unsanitary 1iving conditions ofthe foreign-born were the ineluctable cause ofmuch ofSan Francisco's illness and death. Ironically, medical ideology ofthe time flatly denied thedirect communicability ofthese diseases until well into the 1880s. Meanwhile, manuscript sources indicate that people generally were much more likely toaccept common-sense empirical evidence fordisease contagion. The\"regular\" medical profession stood onshaky ground in1870s SanFrancisco. They quarreled among themselves and competed forclients.298 Their success rate intreatment ofinfectious diseases waspoor, despite their all-out attack onalternative practitioners towhom their patients turned. Much oftheregulars' effort went into theprofessionalization andlegitimization oftheir medical ideology. Almost none ofthese physicians engaged inresearch and few were interested inissues ofpublic health. They relied oncharismatic authority andidentification with \"science\" tomaintain public faith intheir brand oftherapeutics. In many ways their attitudes are analogous tothose ofphysicians today. Medical alternatives put forth the same inducements wholistic health offers today: personal control, preventive approaches, mild therapies, cheaper and less impersonal treatment, and noinstitutionalization. People could diagnose and treat themselves athome. The emphasis onhygiene and personal control also justified accusations against people ofother classes and ethnic groups assources ofdisease. Personal immorality and excessive behavior were believed topass ontochildren asaconstitutional diathesis or\"bent\" that carried its owndisease susceptibility. Thus whole groups ofpeople were responsible through immoral behavior for the incidence and prevalence ofdisease. People could clearly see disease brewing not only inthe miasms arising from raw sewage, but also inthe squalor ofhuman living conditions. Moderation and obedience tonatural law were the best preventives against disease. Theaffected poor hadlittle choice inthese matters however. Nor did they have the luxury ofattendance byprivate physicians. Their use ofhome remedies, patent medicines and other alternatives was not amatter offree choice, but necessity. The insecure economic and social conditions of1870s San Francisco produced anxiety andsocial stress resulting inmental andphysical ill ness. Suicide and heart disease were common. People desired togain299 control over their condition. Physicians did sobyorganizing themselves professionally andlaunching repeated attacks theprofession. Other SanFranciscans sought control over their lives through consultation with mediums, clairvoyants, ormetaphysical healers. They looked for cures they could administer tothemselves in the form ofpatent medicines, home remedies and other palliatives. Both physicians and others blamed thespecial climate ofSan Francisco for increasing disease. They believed that retreat tothecountry ortothe mineral springs and spas ofnorthern California would bring relief. Examination ofthecultural context ofhistorical disease experience makes itpossible for ustobecome more self-conscious about our own time and place, just asdoes current cross-cultural research. This examina tion of1870s San Francisco theearly struggle ofprecursors to today's dominant medical profession todefine themselves and gain social control. Medical anthropologists have discovered again and again the conflicts between this ideology ofscientific biomedicine and indigenous medical systems. Similar conflicts occur today asacentury ago inour ownsociety, asillustrated inthis work. Historical research makes it possible for ustosee beyond thecultural containment ofour own time and place. Most social scientists concerned with health and disease have worked well within thelegitimated framework ofbiomedicine, neither inter pretations were very much theproducts ofbelief and ideology. Medical paradigm changes occurred specifically around newunderstanding ofthe300 etiology and treatment ofinfectious thehistoric growth ofthefields ofepidemiology and public health. Additionally, asforeign immigration continued into the United States through the end ofthe19th-century and into the 20th, recognition ofthesuffering of10wer classes from infectious diseases had tooccur. Itled tovarious social attitudes and responses ranging consciousness andefforts toestablish public health epidemics such as\"Legion naires' Disease\", herpes, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome have joined newviral interpretations ofchronic killing diseases toalter popular health perceptions. But the average person inAmerica today still expects tobespared acute infectious diseases. Heorshe takes for granted themiracles ofantisepsis, antibiotics, pain-killing drugs, miraculous surgery, and life-saving technology. These developments have assured the remarkable success and power ofthe\"regular\" profession. But wearestill faced today with aninevitable bodily death sentence. Those who die today are much older than they were acentury ago, but they also face afar more entrenched and inflexible medical establishment con trolling theculture ofmedicine. Historical andcultural awareness makes clear thecontradictions between health needs andpractice. Italso forces theanthropologist torecognize that the most basic questions about society revolve around those structures that have the power toinculcate beliefs and define cultural reality.301 BIBLIOGRAPHY Abbott, Edith 1924 Select Chicago: ofChicago Press.
