High blood pressure should never be ignored, as it can lead to health complications, diseases like heart disease, retinopathy (eye disease) and chronic kidney disease, and even death. An easy way to keep tabs on your blood pressure levels and ensure they aren't in an elevated range is with an [at-home blood pressure monitor.](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/best-blood-pressure-monitors/) There are an array of blood pressure monitors out there that make tracking your readings easy, and once you know your numbers, you can take the necessary steps to get them within a healthy range. While medications may be necessary to lower your blood pressure, reducing high blood pressure at home is possible with some dedication. Even if you're on doctor-prescribed medication, there are steps you can take to reduce your blood pressure naturally. 12 Ways to Lower Your Blood Pressure Naturally In addition to determining whether you need medications, which you should discuss with your doctor, healthy lifestyle choices can make a significant difference in reducing [high blood pressure](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/high-blood-pressure-symptoms/). Try incorporating the following changes and habits into your daily life. 1. Lose Weight if You're Overweight [Weight loss](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/how-to-lose-weight-fast/) is an important part of reducing high blood pressure, especially for people with obesity, as it's a strong risk factor for hypertension. Dr. Mehta says people who are overweight can have between a two- to six-fold increase in risk of developing hypertension. \"With less weight, the heart and arteries do not have to work as hard,\" says Dr. Desai. \"The heart muscle and the muscles in the arteries do not thicken. Thickening can lead to further increases in blood pressure because of reduced give or elasticity of blood vessels.\" Talk to your doctor or registered dietitian about a safe [weight loss program](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-weight-loss-program/) that will work for you, or consider trying a support app like [Noom](https://noom.8utb.net/c/1955282/846198/8591). \"Even modest weight loss in these patients\u20144 to 10 pounds\u2014is associated with a significant reduction in blood pressure levels,\" says Dr. Mehta. However, a 2013 study of more than 740 people found long-term reductions in blood pressure only persisted with weight loss exceeding 2% of the person's initial weight [[1]](#footnote_1). 2. Exercise Regular exercise not only aids in weight loss, but also helps decrease high blood pressure. A 2016 study found blood pressure decreased in the hours after an exercise session regardless of a person's age, sex and other characteristics [[2]](#footnote_2). This effect can result in \"somewhere between a 10 and 15 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure levels,\" says Dr. Mehta. Most doctors recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each day. \"Aerobic exercise gets the heart rate up in a gradual and consistent fashion, helps to stretch the heart and arteries, and also increases blood flow to the organs,\" says Dr. Desai. If you can't do 30 minutes, Dr. Desai recommends at least 15 to 20 minutes a day, five to seven days a week. Some aerobic exercise options include walking, running, swimming, using an elliptical machine, cycling and playing tennis. 3. Decrease Your Salt Intake \"Salt is the enemy of high blood pressure,\" says Dr. Desai. When you eat too much salt, it increases the amount of fluid that enters the bloodstream and arteries from the surrounding tissue, which raises the pressure in the arteries. While you may not have to remove salt from your diet completely, avoid foods very high in salt like chips, French fries, salted nuts, soups, store-bought salad dressings, processed foods and cheese. 4. Avoid Excess Caffeine Drinking too much coffee or too many energy drinks that contain caffeine isn't recommended for people with high blood pressure. \"Caffeine is a form of adrenaline,\" says Dr. Desai. \"It constricts the arteries and raises the heart rate, both of which increase blood pressure.\" If you have high blood pressure, ask your doctor whether you need to adjust your morning coffee habit, as Dr. Mehta says high levels of caffeine can worsen blood pressure control. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers the equivalent of four cups of coffee a day (400 milligrams) safe for the general population, but most experts recommend 200 milligrams or less (two cups of coffee) for people with established hypertension, says Dr. Mehta. 5. Drink More Water Staying hydrated may be an important way to keep your [blood pressure reading in a normal range](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/normal-blood-pressure-chart-by-age/). \"When you're dehydrated, the body produces stress hormones to maintain blood flow to organs,\" says Dr. Desai. This response can increase blood pressure. Meanwhile, a 2015 study found a link between dehydration and high blood pressure, although more research is needed [[3]](#footnote_3). Reducing your caffeine intake and drinking water regularly are both effective ways to prevent dehydration. 6. Drink Less Alcohol A large 2019 study conducted by the American College of Cardiology found moderate alcohol consumption, defined as seven to 13 drinks a week, can substantially increase risk of high blood pressure [[4]](#footnote_4). Alcohol can increase your body weight, deplete the body of [magnesium](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-magnesium-supplement/) and potassium, and dehydrate you, according to Dr. Desai. What's more, alcohol increases stress levels, which [cause elevated blood pressure](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/high-blood-pressure-causes/) over time as well, he says. 7. Try Blood Pressure Support Supplements A small study in the International Journal of Hypertension found magnesium supplementation can reduce blood pressure in small amounts [[5]](#footnote_5). Talk to your doctor before taking magnesium supplements, especially if you have kidney disease. You can also safely incorporate high-magnesium foods into your diet. Dr. Desai recommends foods like leafy green vegetables and unsalted almonds. Beyond magnesium, research in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology suggests [supplements for blood pressure](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/supplements-lower-blood-pressure/), such as potassium, flavonoids, beetroot juice, coenzyme Q10, controlled-release [melatonin](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-melatonin-supplements/) and aged garlic extract may also help reduce blood pressure [[6]](#footnote_6) 8. Avoid Processed Foods A healthy diet plays an important part in reducing high blood pressure, so many doctors recommend reducing consumption of processed foods. Processed foods are often loaded with sodium and saturated fats, two things people with hypertension want to avoid. \"A good rule of thumb is to have multiple colors of food on your plate,\" says Dr. Desai. He recommends eating more berries, bananas, beets, dark chocolate, kiwis, watermelon, oats, garlic, lentils, pomegranates, cinnamon, unsalted pistachios and fermented foods like yogurt. 9. Reduce Stress Through Meditation and Rest \" [Chronic stress](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/what-is-chronic-stress/) can lead to chronic elevations in the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline,\" says Dr. Desai. \"These hormones constrict the arteries and cause weight gain, which further increases blood pressure.\" He recommends reducing stress by using breathing exercises, practicing meditation, completing physical exercise, practicing yoga, logging quality sleep, taking breaks throughout the day, spending time in nature, listening to music and [eating a balanced diet](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-diets/). 10. Quit Smoking \"Smoking leads to constriction of the arteries acutely, and long-term use greatly contributes to the development of high blood pressure,\" says Dr. Mehta. One study in Hypertension found smoking can cause an immediate but temporary increase in blood pressure [[7]](#footnote_7). Take the steps you need to [quit smoking](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/how-to-quit-smoking-expert-tips/) if you have hypertension. 11. Eat Dark Chocolate Small amounts of dark chocolate aren't just tasty\u2014they might help lower blood pressure as well. One large 2010 study found people who didn't have hypertension and ate more dark chocolate had lower blood pressure than those who ate less dark chocolate [[8]](#footnote_8). Dr. Desai notes the dark chocolate should have high amounts of cocoa\u2014aim for at least 70%\u2014and should be low in sugar. \"It's likely that a compound in dark chocolate known as flavonoids releases a substance known as [nitric oxide](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/nitric-oxide-supplements/), which relaxes blood vessels,\" says Dr. Mehta. 12. Try the DASH Diet If you're unsure how to change your diet to lower blood pressure, Dr. Mehta recommends trying the [ Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/what-is-the-dash-diet/), which he says is \"the best studied dietary approach to helping with hypertension.\" It consists of foods rich in potassium, calcium, magnesium, [fiber](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-fiber-supplements/) and [protein](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-protein-powders/) and low in saturated fat and sodium. What Is High Blood Pressure? \"Blood pressure is basically the pressure within our arteries, which are the tubes that carry blood away from the heart in order to distribute oxygen to the rest of our bodies,\" says Sameer K. Mehta, M.D., a cardiologist at Denver Heart in Lakewood, Colorado. A blood pressure reading consists of two numbers: systolic blood pressure, which is the top number, and diastolic blood pressure, which is the bottom number. A reading lower than 120/80 mmHg is considered [normal blood pressure](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/normal-blood-pressure-chart-by-age/), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As of 2017, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology define elevated blood pressure as systolic readings between 120 and 129 mmHg and diastolic readings less than 80 mmHg. And as of 2021, nearly 50% of U.S. adults have high blood pressure [[9]](#footnote_9). Unless blood pressure is extremely elevated, at least three separate blood pressure readings are required to diagnose hypertension, and one of those readings should be performed outside the doctor's office, says Dr. Mehta. Up to a third of the population develops high blood pressure readings isolated to the doctor's office because of a phenomenon known as \"white coat hypertension,\" which is when your blood pressure readings are higher in a doctor's office exclusively, often thought to be caused by the stress of being there. \"High blood pressure means that this consistently elevated pressure is more than what your organs and arteries can handle,\" says Aseem Desai, M.D., a cardiologist with Providence Mission Hospital in Southern California. \"As a result, the heart and arteries work harder to deliver blood and oxygen to organs. If this occurs, part of our organs do not function properly and/or can die.\" For instance, if the heart has to pump against high blood pressure constantly, the heart muscle can hypertrophy (enlarge) and eventually lose its ability to function properly. High blood pressure can increase your risk of developing a heart attack, stroke, death, kidney failure, eye damage and heart failure. What Causes High Blood Pressure? In many cases, the cause of high blood pressure can be difficult to determine. \"At least 90% of blood pressure is defined as essential hypertension, which basically means there is no distinct cause identified,\" says Dr. Mehta. According to the CDC, hypertension develops over time and can often occur due to unhealthy lifestyle choices like poor diet and a lack of exercise. According to Dr. Mehta, less than 10% of patients have identifiable [causes of high blood pressure](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/high-blood-pressure-causes/), which can include: - Tumors in the adrenal glands - Aorta abnormalities - Narrowing of the kidney arteries - Thyroid abnormalities Dr. Desai adds other risk factors include: - A family history of high blood pressure - Obesity - Physical inactivity - A high-salt diet - Alcohol and caffeine use - [Sleep apnea](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/sleep-apnea/) According to the CDC, diabetes can increase your risk, too, and hypertension can occur during pregnancy. Some medications, such as oral contraceptives, [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/pain-relievers-can-raise-blood-pressure/), corticosteroids, antidepressants, weight loss medications and antacids that contain sodium, can exacerbate hypertension as well. Symptoms of High Blood Pressure Doctors and researchers like Dr. Desai refer to high blood pressure as \"the silent killer\" because there typically are no symptoms, which is why it's so important to monitor your blood pressure, especially if you are already at risk. However, a small number of people do experience symptoms, according to Dr. Desai. [Symptoms of high blood pressure](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/high-blood-pressure-symptoms/) may include: - Headache - Poor vision - Shortness of breath - Blood in urine - Dizziness - Chest pain - Nose bleeds What Is the Best Way to Lower Blood Pressure Quickly? To lower your blood pressure within minutes, experts at Tufts Medical Center recommend performing one of the following actions: - Take a warm shower or bath for at least 15 minutes, which may also alleviate muscle tension. - Take a deep breath, hold it for two seconds, then exhale slowly. Repeat as needed. - Enjoy a relaxing activity, such as meditating, going for a leisurely walk, reading or stretching. What Can You Drink to Lower Blood Pressure? Studies show drinking green and black tea may help lower blood pressure. Certain juices, such as pomegranate, beet and unsalted tomato juice, may help as well. Additionally, dehydration is linked to high blood pressure. To maintain healthy blood pressure levels, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies recommends adult women drink 2.7 liters (95 ounces or 9 cups) of water per day and adult men drink 3.7 liters (131 ounces or 13 cups) of water per day. What Foods Can You Eat to Lower Blood Pressure? Foods high in magnesium, such as unsalted nuts and leafy green vegetables, can help [lower blood pressure](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/best-food-to-lower-blood-pressure/). You might also try eating more dark chocolate and foods featured in the DASH diet, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, lean meats, seeds and healthy fats. When to See Your Doctor About Blood Pressure Concerns If you have a family history of high blood pressure or any of the risk factors or symptoms listed above, make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your blood pressure, says Dr. Mehta. You should also get it checked at least once a year. If your systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 180 mmHg or your diastolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 120 mmHg, call your doctor immediately. If, in addition to these blood pressure readings, you have symptoms including headache and chest pain, call 911.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is considered high blood pressure? High blood pressure, also referred to as hypertension, is defined by systolic readings of at least 130 mmHg and diastolic readings of at least 80 mmHg, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). What is the most popular medication for high blood pressure? Depending on your specific health situation, if you're diagnosed with hypertension (high blood pressure), your doctor may recommend a [medication](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/blood-pressure-medications/) (or medications) from the following classes: - ACE inhibitors - Alpha blockers - Alpha-2 Receptor Agonists - Angiotensin II receptor blockers - Beta-blockers - Calcium channel blockers - Central agonists - Combined alpha and beta-blockers - Diuretics - Peripheral adrenergic inhibitors - Vasodilators ACE inhibitor lisinopril is one of the most popularly prescribed medications for high blood pressure, followed by calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate. What does high blood pressure feel like? High blood pressure often carries no noticeable symptoms. However, a study in the British Journal of General Practice found some patients reported [[10]](#footnote_10): - Headaches - Shortness of breath - Nosebleeds - Flushing - Dizziness - Chest pains - Visual changes - Blood in urine - Mood changes - Constipation How does drinking water lower blood pressure? Dehydration is linked to various heart conditions, including high blood pressure. It may cause the brain to secrete vasopressin, a hormone that, in high amounts, causes blood vessels to constrict and the kidneys to reabsorb water rather than pass it as urine. As a result, dehydrated individuals may experience high blood pressure. Drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day\u20142.7 liters (95 ounces or 9 cups) for women and 3.7 liters (131 ounces or 13 cups) for men\u2014can help manage blood pressure levels. How does exercise lower blood pressure? Physical activity can help lower blood pressure by keeping the heart and blood vessels healthy. Additionally, adequate exercise may aid in healthy weight maintenance, reduce stress and strengthen the heart, all of which contribute to healthy blood pressure levels, according to the AHA. Does aspirin lower blood pressure? Taking low-dose aspirin on a regular basis may help lower a person's risk of heart attack or stroke by preventing blood clots. Some studies indicate that taking aspirin may reduce blood pressure in certain individuals; however, more research is needed to validate these claims. Consult with a health care provider to determine whether you should incorporate aspirin into your wellness routine. "}
