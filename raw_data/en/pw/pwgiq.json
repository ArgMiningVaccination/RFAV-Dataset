This type of preparation mixes beneficial foods and promotes fitness and a healthy lifestyle we all want to jump into. But let's face it: at some point, we all had some doubts about the so-called magical effects of drinking healthy detox drinks. So what is the truth behind detox drinks? In this article we will explain what healthy detox drinks are, their benefits and risks, what are they useful for and which of them you can give a try to! What does detox mean? The term 'detox' (derived from 'detoxification') refers to all kinds of preparations such as juices, smoothies or even diets that have such a purpose on our body. This name seems to automatically evoke sensations of cleanliness or body purification. These preparations are commonly used both for weight loss and for 'purifying' or 'detoxifying' the body from both eating excesses and unhealthy habits. Within this denomination we find smoothies and juices, usually containing a mixture of fruits and/or vegetables, with added supplements such as spirulina. We can also find some fashionable 'superfoods' among the ingredients, such as kale, ginger or a\u00e7a\u00ed. The detox process is supposed to clean your digestive system and help your body eliminate the toxins absorbed from the air, soil, water and, of course, food. A detoxed body prevents the onset of health issues like bloating, gases, headaches, constipation, headaches, fatigues, nausea and even problems with your skin. Are they really useful? It would seem that, given that healthy detox drinks are prepared from fruits and vegetables, they can be an interesting alternative to introduce these foods into our diet. However, there is nothing in this type of preparation that will make your body purify or detoxify automatically. You will just get the nutritional value of the vegetables and fruits you are consuming. Given that detox fruits and vegetables are usually rich in fiber, drinks made of them can work as natural laxatives. An issue around detox is the preservation of enzymes. Cooking food has been repeatedly proven to destroy them: most of them lose their function from as low as 45 to 50 \u00baC, denaturing themselves as proteins. However, these enzymes are also denatured when they get in contact with highly acidic environments. So, by the time they reach the stomach, they lose their function anyway. In addition to all of the above, these enzymes contained in food probably would not have any beneficial effect, even if they were not denatured, contrary to what is often attributed to them. Are healthy detox drinks so healthy? [The alarm has gone off](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2903/sp.efsa.2016.EN-1067) in Germany since the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has identified the high consumption of oxalates associated with drinking detox juices as an emerging risk. Apparently, some of the foods generally used in these kinds of preparations such as spinach, kale or beets are very rich in those components. However, excessive consumption could lead to an increased risk of kidney stones. To sum it up: too much of everything is bad. There is no need to demonize detox drinks, just keep in mind that they are not something you should have on a daily basis. Should we have healthy detox drinks? Although it is true that these shakes do not 'detoxify' the body, they are recommended drinks for refreshing and hydrating ourselves and therefore avoid the consumption of industrial-prepared drinks. Healthy detox drinks are one of the best alternatives to popular commercial soft drinks, since they do not contain sugar or other detrimental ingredients for the body. On the contrary, they are full of high-quality nutrients. So, sorry to break it to you: detox drinks are not magical drinks. That said, it doesn't mean you can't enjoy them once in a while and take advantage of the benefits they do provide!
