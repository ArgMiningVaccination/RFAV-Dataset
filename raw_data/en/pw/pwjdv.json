I was having autoimmune thyroid issues and not getting anywhere with my Primary Care Physician. Dr. Layne came highly recommended and I knew after my first visit, that I was in the correct place. She truly looked at the whole picture and listened to me about how I was feeling and all I had gone through. Simple testing helped us figure everything out and I feel better than I have in years. I truly feel like \"myself\" again and my Primary Care Physician was so impressed, that she is now going to see her as well. Thank you Dr. Layne!\" \"Dr. Layne was the first doctor to listen and believe me when I told her how horrible my period cramps were. She has supported me unconditionally through my journey addressing endometriosis. I am so thankful to Have found a naturopathic doc like her who takes my insurance. She's very easy to talk to and makes solving problems a lot less stressful for me.\" \"Harmony is the most informed, credible, empathetic, and genuinely helpful naturopath I have ever worked with. She truly understands clean eating, healing the source cause instead of symptoms, and is easy to communicate with. I've met with many many various health professionals over the years and I recommend her above anyone else 10/10.\" \"What a huge blessing Dr. Harmony Layne has been to me. I first saw her for a chronic sinus infection that had plagued me something fierce. She carefully and thoughtfully listened to ALL my concerns. I never felt rushed or hurried during our visits which is a rarity in this day and age. Her attention to detail is what I believe helped finally solve this health concern of mine...A long ongoing issue that 3 other doctors had missed. I find Dr. Layne highly intelligent, kind and so thoughtful. Most importantly, I felt cared for and that I mattered. We are a team. That's big in my book. I now see her for other health concerns and feel great that she is in my corner. What a gift Dr. Layne is to me and I suspect all her patients. I am lucky to have found her.\" \"Dr. Layne is the single most important practitioner in my life. Without her, I'd be suffering from lingering symptoms, taking who-knows-how-many medications, and - perhaps worst of all - feeling confused and dismissed. Instead, I'm extremely well-cared-for and - very importantly - healthy!\" Receive a Consultation From The Comfort of Your Own Home We want to remove all barriers and help you achieve your health and wellness goals.
