It part of an ongoing train of exploration in my own practice around how to build energy in meditation ergonomically and effectively. My monthly [Monthly Qi Gong & Taoist Breathwork Clinic & Mini-retreat](http://integralmeditationasia.com/workshops-classes/monthly-qi-gong-taoist-breathwork-clinic-mini-retreat/) on 25th February is now full, waiting list only. I have added an extra session on [Sunday the 26th](http://integralmeditationasia.com/workshops-classes/monthly-qi-gong-taoist-breathwork-clinic-mini-retreat/) for those who may want to participate. In the spirit of regeneration, Toby Energizing stillness - Regenerating within your energy body The below meditation is a way to regenerate your energy more powerfully when you are feeling tired or low energy. It is designed to be low-intensity and relaxing, as well as 'plugging you in' to sources of energy that can start to percolate through your body and energy system as you relax. It's based around principles of Qi gong (eastern) and Tree of Life (western) meditation practices that I have done for many years, but you don't need to know anything about these practices the meditation. Once you are familiar with it, you can set it up at the beginning of your meditation session, and then go onto do your main meditation, whatever that is. If you do this then the energy flow will continue in the background as you do your meditation. The exercise can be done standing, sitting or lying down. What is your energy body? For the purposes of this meditation, consider your energy body as being essentially the biological life-force that flows through and radiates from your physical body, but then includes the emotional, mental and consciousness dimensions within you. It can be imagined simply as a body of light, same shape and size as your physical body, and occupying the same space. You can also imagine it as having an energy field around your body, like an egg or sphere of light. Beginning the meditation includes simply relaxing and gently sensing into your energy body, getting a feeling for it as you breathe. Connecting your energy body to the Earth's field After centring in your basic light body, in your minds eye look down through the surface of the earth beneath you all the way down to the solar core of the planet. Visualize beneath your body a ball of light about a meter in diameter. At the bottom of the ball see a line of light like a rope dropping down all the way into the centre of the planet. From that line, energy from the Planetary being flows up and into the ball, filling it with Earth-light. Now imagine your body sinks down 3-5cms into the ball beneath you, so that the energy from the Earth starts to flow into your energy body from below. Just feel and allow that to happen without any special effort, this is a gentle, yin energy body exercise. Connecting it to sky and stars Imagine there is a ball of light about the size of a golf-ball, half way in, half way out of the crown of your head. Imagine it to be a little bit like an antenna. Be aware of the huge dome of sky and stars above and around you. Feel a gentle flow of subtle energy from the sky and stars descending and connecting to the crown of your head, from there gently flowing down into your energy body. Practicing non-striving Once you have set up the circuit then simply practice relaxing your body-mind as deeply as you can into a state of [non-striving](http://tobyouvry.com/2014/06/non-striving/), do as little as possible and allow the energy from above and below to start to circulate gently through your energy body, organically and without forcing anything. Stay with this for as long as you have decided to meditate. Everyday awareness Once you are familiar with this meditation you can do it walking around or in the bus. You can even do it lying in bed at night whilst you wait to go to sleep. Without forcing anything, this practice connects you to the meta-energies of the Planetary being beneath and the sky and stars above, letting the flow of their energies enter, balance and exchange in a regenerative way with our own energy body. \u00a9 Toby Ouvry 2023, you are welcome to use or share this article, but please cite Toby as the source and include reference to his website [www.tobyouvry.com](http://tobyouvry.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f468ff8928b502cdd57df0ec4&id=8f38877e2a&e=934a6ce6e8) All upcoming classes and workshops at IMA: Ongoing - [Weekly Tuesday, Wednesday Online class schedule](http://integralmeditationasia.com/workshops-classes/online-integral-meditation-mindfulness-classes/) Ongoing on Wednesday's, 7.30-8.30pm - [Wednesday Meditation for stress transformation and positive energy with Toby](http://integralmeditationasia.com/workshops-classes/wednesday-integral-meditation-classes-at-basic-essence-with-toby/) (Bukit Timah) Ongoing on Tuesday evenings, 7.30-8.30pm - [Tuesday Meditation for stress transformation and positive energy with Toby ](http://integralmeditationasia.com/workshops-classes/tuesday-meditation-classes-at-oner-heart-with-toby-east-coast/) (East Coast) Ongoing - [Introduction to Integral Meditation & Mindfulness Practice - An eight-week course](http://integralmeditationasia.com/workshops-classes/intro-to-i-m-p-an-8-week-course/) Saturday & Sunday February 25/26th, 9.30-11.30am - [Monthly Qi Gong & Taoist Breathwork Clinic & Mini-retreat](http://integralmeditationasia.com/workshops-classes/monthly-qi-gong-taoist-breathwork-clinic-mini-retreat/) Tues 21st & Weds 22nd March, 7.30-8.30pm - [Spring Equinox balancing and renewing meditation](http://integralmeditationasia.com/workshops-classes/spring-equinox-balancing-and-renewing-meditation/) Sat & Sunday 1st, 2nd April - [Two day integral meditation retreat](http://integralmeditationasia.com/workshops-classes/integral-meditation-two-day-retreat/) Integral Meditation Asia "}
