Introduction In recent years, acupuncture has gained popularity in Western med- icine in part due to successful treatment of chronic pain ( White, 2009 ). Despite its increasingly widespread use by the general population, clinical trials evaluating the ef cacy of acupuncture report inconsistent results. Often they show the general advantage of acupuncture overother physical interventions ( Corbett et al., 2013; Manyanga et al., 2014; Vickers and Linde, 2014 ). The lack of understanding of the under- lying mechanisms of acupuncture and reported cases of a failure to elicit greater clinical improvement compared to sham acupuncture ( Hinman et al., 2014; Kong et al., 2013; Langevin et al., 2011 ), however, have ham- pered incorporation of this treatment modality into mainstream medical practice. Functional neuroimaging investigation into the mechanisms of acu- puncture shows that acupuncture needle stimulation is associated with fMRI signal increase in the insula, thalamus, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, caudate, posterior cingu- thalamus and parahippocampus, as 2013 ). addition,connectivity between these pain regions and the periaqueductal gray(PAG) is modulated during acupuncture ) and dif- ferentiates verum (genuine) and sham treatments. However, to dateneuroimaging studies focused on either the brain regions responding to acute pain sensation and/or measured resting state changes during or immediately after an acupuncture session. Long-term treatment effects and changes in brain regions associated with chronic pain re- main unknown. In parallel, substantial effort has gone into identifying the brain regions and networks that show signi cant changes during the transition from acute to chronic pain ( Apkarian et al., 2011; Hashmi et al., 2013 ), associated, inter alia, with long-term pain learning (Mansour et al., 2014 ). Most often the medial frontal cortex (MFC) (Baliki et al., 2011, 2014; Cauda et al., 2014; Mutso et al., 2013 )a n d bilateral hippocampus (Hpc) ( Gondo et al., al., 2013; Ploghaus et al., 2001; Vachon-Presseau et al., 2013 ) are implicated. These brain regions appear to be the hubs involved inpain perception ( Gondo et al., 2009; 2007 memory and emotion ( Lang et al., 2009; Ploghaus et al., 2001 ), and as such con- trol pain perception and modulation. Of special relevance is the connectivity between the MFC, Hpc and the PAG. While both MFC and Hpc are directly involved in any type of learning and memory consolidation and retrieval ( Carter et al., 2006; van Kesteren et al., 2010 ), the PAG is speci cally implicated in aversive learning and prediction error generation, which is crucial for forming long-term pain behavior and nociceptive memory ( Roy et al., 2014 ).

This led us to investigate whether acupuncture, known to work through the descending pain modulation system ( Kong et al., 2010 ), including the PAG, could be instrumental in normalizing chronic pain braincircuitry. In this study we examined the relationship between chronic knee osteoarthritis symptoms (measured with the Knee injury andOsteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain and sport subscales) and resting state connectivity between PAG -MFC and PAG -Hpc, as both MFC and Hpc are crucial for pain learning, attention and memory. Wehypothesized that lower PAG -Hpc connectivity (associated with less attention to pain, anxiety and nociceptive memory) would correlatewith better pain and sport scores; in contrast, lower PAG -MFC connec- tivity (indicating increased attention to pain, low analgesia expectation,higher pain avoidance) would correlate with increased pain and sport scores. We also hypothesized that connectivity in PAG -Hpc and PAG -MFC would be improved by repeated verum acupuncture (compared to sham). 2. Materials and methods The full details of subject enrollment and inclusion, study design, acupuncture procedures and fMRI acquisition are reported elsewhere (Chen et al., 2014; Spaeth et al., 2013 ). Here we provide a brief descrip- tion of the methods and focus on the procedures and analysis details relevant for this study. 2.1. Subjects Forty-four knee osteoarthritis patients (19 females) were enrolled in the study, of which 30 (13 females, aged 57.5 \u00b1 8.3, mean \u00b1 SD) com- pleted all experimental stages. The Institutional Review Board of the Massachusetts General Hospital approved all study procedures. The subjects provided informed consent at the beginning of the study and were debriefed at the end of the study. 2.2. Experimental design Subjects in this study had either unilateral or bilateral knee pain, however, they all received acupuncture treatment on either right or left knee (whichever presented with more severe pain). Subsequent treatment and pain assessment only focused on one knee. Subjects were randomized into one of the three groups: 1) verum acupuncture at 6 acupoints, 2) verum acupuncture at 2 acupoints, or 3) sham acu- puncture (6 acupoints with Streitberger placebo needles), keeping knee condition (bilateral/unilateral pain predominantly in right/left knee) balanced across groups. After the initial screening, each subject received a total of 6 acupuncture sessions within one month (twice a week during weeks 1 -2 and once a week during weeks 3 -4). Treat- ments 1, 3, and 6 were conducted with the patient lying in a 3 TeslaMRI scanner. Treatments 2, 4 and 5 took place in a behavioral testing room. Verum acupuncture was performed on ST35 and Xiyan points for the low-dose verum groups and at GB34, SP9, GB39 for the high-dose group. Both ST35 and Xiyan points are located near the knee. They are typically used in knee pain treatment and have been pre- viously used in osteoarthritis clinical trials ( Berman et al., Cheng, 1987; Scharf ). Placebo acupunc- ture was performed in 6 spots on the lower leg, where no meridians pass through. All subjects received acupuncture treatment on the ipsi-lateral side (i.e., on the painful knee); subjec ts receiving acupuncture at 6 points had acupuncture performed on both legs, but never uniquely on the con-tralateral side ( Yi et al., 2011 ).Each acupuncture session lasted approximately 25 min and was the same for all subjects, regardless of t he group assignment. For the purposes of this analysis, subjects in the two verum acupuncture groups were com- bined, as the two treatment types evoked similar deqisensation, had the same stimulation time and treatment effect, as indicated by KOOS(Spaeth et al., 2013 ). Compared to verum acupuncture, in which the nee- dle penetrates the skin, sham acupuncture was performed with non- penetrating Streitberger needles (the needle retracts up into the shaft when pressed against the skin). Sub jects were blind to the site of needle insertion and to whether the treatment was verum or sham. For the dura-tion of the treatment, subjects agreed not to receive any other medical in- tervention or medication for their knee osteoarthritis. Treatment clinical outcomes were measured using the KOOS ( Roos et al., 1998 ), comprising 5 subscales: 1) pain, 2) other symptoms, 3) function in daily living, 4) function in sport and recreation, and5) knee-related quality of life. Each subscale is measured from 0 -100, with a greater score signaling improvement. The KOOS was adminis-tered to all patients at baseline (up to one week before treatment 1) and after the nal treatment (treatment 6). The scale requires patients to assess their state during the preceding week. Based on ourhypotheses and previous results showing signi cant differences between sham and verum acupuncture ( Chen et al., 2014 ), we only focused on 2 subscales: pain and sport, the latter representing pain ratings during increased physical activity; the other subscales were not analyzed. 2.3. fMRI acquisition and pre-processing Each subject underwent 3 fMRI scanning sessions. Each scanning session included a 6-minute resting state scan (a), two functional scans during acupuncture (25 min) (b), as well as another 6-minute resting state scan (c), see Fig. 1 . We here focus only on the resting state scans (a) before acupuncture treatment during fMRI session 1and session 3. Resting state session 1 (henceforth 'pre'-acupuncture resting state) was performed before the beginning of repeated acupunc- ture treatment and within about a week of the measurement of the baseline KOOS (KOOS-pre). Resting state session 3 (henceforth 'post '- acupuncture resting state) was performed approximately 25 days laterfollowing 5 acupuncture treatments but before the nal (6th) acupunc- ture treatment. For the resting state scan subjects were required to keeptheir eyes open. The nal KOOS (KOOS-post) was measured on the same day but after the 6th acupuncture treatment was performed, see Fig. 1 . Scanning was performed using a 3-axis gradient head coil in a 3 Tesla Siemens MRI scanner with echo planar imaging (EPI). Structuralscans were acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with TR = 2200 ms, TE = 9.8 ms, flip angle of 7\u00b0, eld of view of 230 mm 2, and slice thickness of 1.2 mm. For the resting state analysis, 47 slices were acquired with the following param- eters: TR = 3000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle of 85\u00b0, the eld of view of 216 mm2,a n d3m m 3m m 3 mm in-plane spatial resolution. The preprocessing of resting state images was done using SPM 8 soft- ware ( http://www. l.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ) implemented in a MATLAB suite (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts). It included slice time correc- tion, head motion correction, co-registration to subjects' structural im- ages, segmentation, normalization, linear detrending and smoothing (FWHM = 6 mm). Functional connectivity analysis was carried out with the CONN toolbox ( www.nitrc.org/projects/conn )(Whiteld-Gabrieli and Nieto- Castanon, 2012 ). Timecourses from the components associated with white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were regressed out of whole-brain gray matter activity, 12 motion regressors (6 realignmentparameters and rst derivatives) were used to control for correlations during movement. Data were ltered between 0.008 and 0.09 Hz, global brain signal was not subtracted. Functional connectivity analysis was performed using an ROI-to-ROI approach. PAG was used as a seed ROI. As PAG mask is not available in431 N. Egorova et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 9 (2015) 430 -435the Harvard -Oxford atlas implemented in the CONN toolbox by default, a bilateral PAG ROI mask was created using Mango software (http://rii.uthscsa.edu/mango/ ) based on several of the previous 30,14 (Leknes et al., 2013 ); \u00b14, 26,14 (Kong et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2014 ); \u00b12, 26,10 (Amanzio et al., 2013; Derbyshire and Osborn, 2009 )) reported in representative pain/analgesia studies and meta-analyses. We created partially overlapping spheres (3- mm radius) around the given coordinates to form one mask (volume 808 mm3) and used it for further analysis. We chose to create this func- tionally rather than an anatomically de ned mask, as PAG is involved in a number of functions not related to pain. This functionally de ned mask covers the coordinates reported for pain, acupuncture and placebo,as identi ed in a recent meta-analysis ( Linnman et al., 2012b ), as well as of other studies ( Kucyi et al., al., tivity of PAG seed with the anatomically de ned bilateral Hpc (combined volume 38,189 mm 3) and MFC (volume 30,833 mm3)( b a s e do nt h eH a r - vard -Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlases, implemented in CONN) was examined. In the rst-level analysis, we produced a correlation map for each subject by extracting the BOLD time course from the PAG seed ROIand computing Pearso n's correlation coef cients between the time course in the PAG and the MFC and Hpc. Connectivity values betweenthe PAG and and MFC ROIs for the pre-acupuncture and post-acupuncture sessions were extracted for each subject. First, we used the PAG -MFC and PAG -Hpc connectivity values for all 30 patients and correlated them with the pre-acupuncture KOOS pain and KOOS sport scores, in order to determine whether these be- havioral measures correlated with the PAG -MFC and PAG -Hpc con- nectivity at baseline. Importantly, identifying the direction of the correlation (positive or negative) with the clinical outcome would allow us to understand how the connectivity needs to change (de- crease or increase) to lead to the improvement in KOOS. As the dif- ferences in age and gender have been previously reported to influence MFC, PAG and Hpc connectivity (Hashmi et al., al., 2013; Linnman et al., 2012a ), we used partial Pearson correlations (controlling for age and gender) to explore the relation of PAG -MFC to pain and sport KOOS. The two subscales were chosen based on a previous study that suggested that acupuncture can pro-vide greater pain relief and improvement in function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee ( Chen et al., 2014 ); as well as based on our previous study (using the same dataset) showing that verum acu-puncture signi cantly improves KOOS pain and sport scores com- pared with sham treatment ( Spaeth et al., 2013 ). After that we performed a second-level connectivity analysis, with a between group factor acupuncture group (verum minus sham) and a within subject factor treatment ('post'\u2014repeated acupuncture treat- ment, i.e. post 5 acupuncture sessions minus 'pre'\u2014acupuncture treat- ment) to identify the effect of verum vs. sham acupuncture post- treatment compared to pre-treatment on the PAG -MFC and PAG -Hpc connectivity. We included age and gender as covariates. Planned com-parisons \u2014between-session differences in each of the acupuncture groups were performed using the CONN toolbox to understand thenature of the change. For all analyses the threshold of p b0.05 FDR- corrected was used.In addition, head motion analysis was performed using the artifact de- tection toolbox (ART) (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/ ). Timepoints were marked as outliers if global signal exceeded threestandard deviations of the mean and if movement exceeded 0.5 mm of scan-to-scan deviation. As head moti on can affect connectivity measures (Power et al., 2012 ), we examined whether there was a difference between the groups in the number of outliers in each session, using 2- sample t-tests (2-tailed). As we primarily used the contrast between sessions ( 'post 'mi nus 'pre') throughout all analyses, we also computed a difference between the number of outliers between the sessionsand compared it between the verum and sham groups with a 2-sample t-test (2-tailed). 3. Results3.1. Behavioral results Full behavioral data analysis of the effects of the verum and sham acupuncture treatment is reported elsewhere ( Chen et al., 2014; Spaeth et al., 2013 ). In summary, typical acupuncture sensations, such as perceived soreness, and aching differed signi cantly between the verum and sham acupuncture groups, suggesting that real acupuncture reliably evoked stronger deqi sensations compared to sham, and led to signi cant improvement (decrease) in knee pain (F (1,28) =5 . 5 9 6 , p = 0.025) and improved function in sport (F (1,27) = 4.252, p = 0.049), as indicated by a repeated measures ANOVA with the Acu-puncture group (verum vs. sham) as the between subject factor and Treatment (pre vs. post) as a within subject factor. Post hoc analysis indicated that repeated verum acupuncture produced a signi cant pos- itive effect on pain (Mean = 12.1, SE = 3.0) and sport clinical outcomes(Mean = 18.4, SE = 5.7), compared to sham. In the sham group almost no difference between KOOS-post minus KOOS-pre was observed for pain (Mean = 0.83, SE = 3.9), and on average slightly negative change was observed for sport (Mean = 1.5, SE = 6.8). We here concentrate on the resting state ROI-to-ROI connectivity analysis and its relation to the pre-treatment KOOS pain and sport subscales. 3.2. Functional connectivity results Partial correlation analysis of the baseline PAG -MFC and PAG -Hpc connectivity and baseline KOOS pain and sport subscales controlling for age and gender, revealed a signi cant negative correlation between the PAG -Hpc connectivity and KOOS pain score r (N = 30) =0.40, p = 0.033 (2-tailed), suggesting that increased PAG -Hpc connectivity was associated with worse pain symptoms in patients with osteoarthri-tis of the knee. It also revealed a signi cant positive correlation between PAG -MFC connectivity and KOOS sport score r (N = 30) = 0.43, p = 0.021 (2-tailed), showing that higher PAG -MFC connectivity accompanied less dif culty experienced when being active on a higher level (sport and recreational activities). No signi cant results for the PAG -MFC and KOOS pain or PAG -Hpc and KOOS sport were found. The analysis of the effect of verum repeated acupuncture treatment ('post 'minus 'pre') compared to sham (verum minus sham) controlling Fig. 1. Study design. Elements of the study design marked in red are relevant for the current report. Elements of the original design marked in gray were not included in the analysis (see ref). Baseline KOOS-pre pain and sport values were used to investigate a correlation between baseline resting state connectivity of PAG -mPFC and PAG -Hpc. The post-acupuncture resting state took place following 5 acupuncture sessions (marked in pink). KOOS-post pain and sport measurements were collected after 6 acupuncture sessions and are mentioned in this study only to show pain and sport KOOS improvement in the verum compared to sham group but are not analyzed in relation to the reported resting state changes. The main analysis is focused on the comparison of the baseline and post-acupuncture resting state in the two acupuncture groups and their relation to baseline KOOS-pre scores.432 N. Egorova et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 9 (2015) 430 -435for the between-group differences in age and gender revealed a sig- nicant change of the PAG -MFC connectivity, b = 0.22, t (26)=2 . 1 8 , p = 0.038, as well as a signi cant change in the PAG -Hpc connectivity, b = 0.19, t (26)=2.34, p = 0.027, both surviving the FDR correction (adjusted p FDR= 0.038). More positive PAG -MFC and more negative connectivity following verum, compared to sham acupunc- ture treatment was observed, consistent with the direction of the corre- lations of PAG -MFC and PAG -Hpc with KOOS scores at baseline, signaling better brain-connectivity and clinical state. In order to understand the nature of the change we plotted the con- nectivity values for each group (verum and sham) and session ( 'pre'and 'post '),Fig. 'post 'sessions acupuncture groups, revealing de- crease in PAG -Hpc connectivity in the verum group (b = 0.12, t(19)=3.47, p = 0.002) and a decrease in PAG -MFC in the sham group (b = 0.2, t (9)=2.95, p = 0.016). No differences in the number of outliers between the verum and sham groups were observed in either of the sessions ( 'pre'\u2014p= 0.23; 'post '\u2014p = 0.24), or in between sessions ( 'post' minus 'pre'\u2014p = 0.66), suggesting that reported differences between the verum and sham groups in connectivity cannot be explained byhead movement. 4. Discussion In this study we investigated the relationship between the connectiv- ity in the brain regions involved in pain learning, attention and memory also implicated in pain chroni cation, and baseline clinical outcome scores (KOOS pain and sport) in patients with osteoarthritis of theknee. We speci cally studied the effect of repeated verum acupuncture (compared to sham) on the change in both connectivity and clinical out-come. We found that PAG -Hpc connectivity was negatively correlated with baseline KOOS pain scores (the lower the connectivity the betterthe pain score) and that it decrease d following repeated verum acupunc- ture resulting in pain score improvement. We also found that PAG -MFC connectivity was positively correlated with KOOS sport scores (thelower the connectivity the worse the sport score), and that it decreasedin subjects who received sham acupuncture, also resulting in minorworsening in the sport score. In contrast, in the verum group maintained PAG- MFC connectivity level was observed together with increased sport scores. Our results suggest that repeated verum acupuncture might re-verse chroni cation in patients by interrupting persistent nociception and reducing attention to pain. 4.1. Pain learning and nociceptive memory Chronic pain has been conceptualized as a type of long-term learning (Apkarian et al., 2011 ), characterized by accumulation of nociceptive memory ( Yi and Zhang, 2011 ) and inability to extinguish negative emo- tional associations and anxiety ( Mutso et al., et al., 2001; Vachon-Presseau al., 2013 ), in which both Hpc and mPFC are involved (Carter et al., 2006; Lang et al., 2009 ). In rats, disrupting hippocampal function has been shown to reverse persistent nociception ( Ma et al., 2013 ). In humans, a recently proposed model of aversive prediction error in pain learning has suggested the PAG as the primary hub in the pain learning neural network ( Roy et al., 2014 ) relying on mPFC and Hpc. However, whether the PAG is directly associated with Hpc or theirconnectivity is mediated through other brain regions, requires further investigation. In our study, at the time of the rst treatment session both the verum and sham groups were na\u00efve to acupuncture, had ongoing pain and had high expectation of relief with treatment as assessed by a pre-treatment rating questionnaire ( Spaeth et al., 2013 ). In terms of connectivity, this stage corresponded to high PAG -Hpc and baseline PAG -mPFC connectivity on average in all subjects (although both posi- tive and negative individual connectivity was observed in the correla-tion analysis). Following treatment, the connectivity of PAG and Hpc in the verum group decreased. In line with the previous studies, this re- duction in connectivity could be the result of updating of nociceptive memory, reducing aversive prediction, leading to lower anticipation and salience of incoming pain. Therepea tedaspect of the treatment could b e crucial for this process of pain-related re-learning, possibly through the immediate pain relief with each verum acupuncture session boosting expectation and introducing Fig. 2.

All connectivity values were calculated as the correlation between the time course from the PAG ROI seed and the time course in the mPFC and Hpc ROIs. A decrease in PAG -Hpc connec- tivity (observed in verum, compared to sham) possibly indicates less attention to pain, anxiety and nociceptive memories; a decrease in PAG -mPFC (observed in sham, compared to verum, resulting in a positive connectivity in the verum Nsham contrast as shown here) possibly indicates more attention to pain and a decrease in relief expectation following repeated acupuncture treatment.433 N. Egorova et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 9 (2015) 430 -435positive re-assessment o f the pain state. As verum acupuncture was asso- ciated with stronger deqisensations (Spaeth et al., 2013 ), it is possible that it activated the descending pain modulation system, initiating the release of endogenous opioids and inhibiting nociceptive signaling from the al., 2009b ), maintaining subjects' ex- pectancy and leading to pain improvement as the treatment progressed.In contrast, maintained high PAG -Hpc connectivity level in the sham group could indicate that no prediction or pain behavior update took place, as subjects did not experience pain relief from se ssion to session, apart from the non-speci ct r e a t m e n te f f e c t s \u2014expectation and 'placebo ' (Kong et al., 2009a ) that decreased over the course of treatment. This speculation is further corrobor ated by the decrease in the PAG- MFC con- nectivity in the sham group, possibly re flecting a reduction in relief expec- tation. Based on these ndings, we suggest that pain reduction during repeated verum acupuncture in patients reverses chroni cation by updating nociceptive memory, while sham acupuncture, relying on ex-pectation alone, fails to maintain this expectation effect in the absence of actual pain relief. 4.2. Attention to pain Another key aspect of pain chroni cation related to pain learning is increased attention to pain ( Durnez and Damme, 2015 ) and aberrant default mode network (DMN) connectivity in chronic pain conditions, suggesting inability to disengage from attending to painful sensations (Baliki et al., 2014 ). Distraction from pain and ( Kucyi et al., 2013; Tracey et al., 2002; Valet et al., 2004 ), as well as acupuncture (Li et al., 2014 ), have been associated with enhanced PAG and increased mPFC activations suggesting that correlated activity between the tworegions results in reduced pain sensation. In line with this, we also found a signi cant positive association between PAG -mPFC connectiv- ity and KOOS sport score at baseline, suggesting that greater PAG -mPFC connectivity is associated with less dif c u l t ye n g a g i n gi ni n c r e a s e d physical activity, such as performing sport and recreational activitieson a higher level. This subscale re flects increased motivation, reduced pain avoidance and emphasis on overcoming the discomfort, likely by shifting attention away from pain and changing pain processing from xed negative emotional back to sensory evaluation ( Hashmi et al., 2013 ). Following acupuncture treatment, subjects in the verum group felt less pain and also demonstrated improvement in sport (increased phys-ical activity), which was coupled with maintained baseline PAG -mPFC connectivity. This pattern of mPFC activation and PAG -mPFC connectiv- ity has been observed in healthy subjects not paying attention to pain, as reported in a previous study ( Kucyi et al., 2013 ), showing baseline DMN activity levels (i.e. no activation) when attention fluc tuated away from pain. The same study also reported a decrease in PAG -mPFC connectivity when subjects paid attention to pain (and felt more pain). Another study on chronic low back pain also linked decreased PAG -mPFC connectivity with worse pain ratings following a pain- inducing maneuver, i.e. increased physical activity similar to that im- plied in the KOOS sport subscale ( Yu et al., 2014 ). Consistent with these previous ndings, we observed decreased PAG -mPFC connectivi- ty in the sham group, possibly representing a sustained focus on pain, which was accompanied by virtually no behavioral pain score improve- ment and, if anything, a decrease in the sport score. This relationship be- tween pain and attention potentially has implications for pain behavior. The difference in connectivity and behavioral patterns between verum and sham acupuncture in our study suggests a possible difference in coping behavior in the two groups. Subjects treated with verum acu- puncture seemed to exhibit more pain tolerance following treatment, engaging in sport and experiencing less pain, possibly by paying less at- tention to it, while sham acupuncture group subjects likely continued to focus on their pain and use pain avoidance strategies. One limitation of the study is that we did not collect any behavioral measures of attention or memory function to con rm a direct relationshipwith the observed connectivity changes. Future research could capitalize on these preliminary ndings to further investigate the relationship be- tween attention and memory improvement following acupuncture.Note, however, that we do not claim any speci c acupuncture-induced improvement in memory and attention in general, but only discuss atten-tion and memory as they relate to pain, placebo and coping strategies, based on previous literature. Although the study was initially designed to test differences be- tween low and high dose acupuncture, we did not make the distinctionbetween the two in the connectivity analysis, due to the absence of be- havioral differences in the clinical outcome between the two groups. As the differences in the neural responses are likely to be subtle, larger sample size to achieve suf cient power teasing apart behavioral and connectivity differences would be required. However, the more promi-nent distinction between verum and sham acupuncture reported here, was apparent in both behavioral and connectivity measures with this sample size. We, therefore, speculate that immediate relief from verum acupunc- ture as part of a series of treatments could help maintain strong relief ex- pectation, ultimately resetting previously learned pain behavior and leading to less avoidance and attention to pain that characterizes chronic pain states. Our results suggest that measuring resting state PAG -mPFC and PAG -Hpc connectivity could be used to provide an estimate of chroni cation in patients with chronic pain disorders. In this study a rel- atively small sample of 30 patients was examined; further validation ofPAG- mPFC and PAG -Hpc connectivity as a marker of pain severity and a measure of success of acupuncture treatment is required. 5. Conclusion This study showed how repeated verum acupuncture treatment changes the behavioral outcomes, as well as the connectivity in key brain regions associated with pain learning, memory and chroni cation. The results suggested that repeated verum acupuncture might normalizepatients' attention to pain and reset xed predictive, motivational and emotional learning, changing patients' pain behavior and reinstatingthe healthy balance within the mind, body and brain. These results have implications for the assessment of the ef cacy of acupuncture treat- ment with regard to reversal of chronic pain disorders.
