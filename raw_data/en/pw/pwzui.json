Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome that is characterized by hyperglycemia, change in the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins [1](#272574:6148255). Diabetes mellitus is the most common chronic and metabolic disease characterized by an increase in glucose levels due to absolute or relative insulin deficiency. The disease is associated with eye, renal, cardiovascular, and neurological complications in the long term. This disease is also associated with symptoms such as polyuria, fatigue, weight loss, delayed wound healing, blurred vision, increases in urine glucose levels, etc. [2](#272574:6148260) [3](#272574:6148274) [4](#272574:6148269). Destruction of beta-cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas and consequently development of insulin-dependent diabetes is one of the impairments of the regulation of the immune system. Several environmental and genetic factors affect the immune system, leading to the attack of lymphocytes, especially lymphocytes, and pancreatitis. This inflammatory response may cause insulitis and diabetes [5](#272574:6148267) [6](#272574:6148273). There are currently more than 150 million people with diabetes across the globe, which seems to reach 300 million by 2025 [7](#272574:6148252). In the absence of proper treatment, cardiac, vascular, neurological, and renal damage and neuropathy may occur. Treatment includes diet, exercise, and medication [8](#272574:6148245). Currently, the main and effective treatment for diabetes is the use of insulin and hypoglycemic drugs, but these compounds also have many adverse side effects [9](#272574:6148262). Medicinal plants have a long history of usage and today, they are being extensively used for various diseases [10](#272574:6148263) [11](#272574:6148241) [12](#272574:6148264) [13](#272574:6148270) [14](#272574:6148261). There are several reasons for increasing the use of medicinal plants. Many plants from different parts of the world have been investigated for antidiabetic effects. This review article reported some of the most important medicinal plants with hypoglycemic properties according to reliable clinical and laboratory evidence, and also touched on the medicinal plants that are prescribed, in Iranian traditional medicine, for the treatment of diabetes. Materials and methods The information in this review was obtained from the eligible articles retrieved using the search terms diabetes mellitus, medicinal plants, type 1 diabetes and medicinal plants, type 2 diabetes and medicinal plants, and the effect of extract and essential oil of medicinal plants affecting diabetized tissues in the human body indexed in databases such as Iran medex, Irandoc, ISI, PubMed, Scopus, SID, Magiran, Google Scholar, etc. Results Based on the results drawn in this review the are effective to control and treat diabetes. The names, families, and used parts of the medicinal plants are summarized is shown in northern Africa||Bangladesh||In vivo2009||Aqueous extract of U. dioica leaf improved the glycemia levels in type 2 diabetic rats, which is mediated by the central effect on the functional status western North America||India||In vitro 2010||The action mechanism of hypoglycemic effect of S. punicea was confirmed by the improvement of insulin resistance in the mice with of jamun pulp showed hypoglycemic activity in streptozotocin-diabetic mice within 30 min of administration while the seed of the same fruit needed 24 h. These extracts also inhibited insulinase activity in the saponins ofFenugreek with sulfonylureas hypoglycemic drug lowered the blood glucose level and ameliorated clinical symptoms in 46 cases of T2DM compared with of the leaf extract was also associated with an increased GFR in STZ-diabetic rats. although the rate important role by improving the morphology and / or function of beta cells. Preventing damage to beta-cell cells, repair damaged beta cells, rebuilding new cells, and stimulating insulin secretion in functional cells is one of the mechanisms of action of the extract of is a condition that is characterized by high blood sugar levels. Millions of people worldwide are affected by the disease. Research on diabetes is ongoing. When a person develops diabetes, insulin deficiency or the body's inability to consume it causes the sugar to remain in the blood instead of reaching the cells and producing energy. This excess amount of sugar in the blood causes the blood sugar level to exceed normal level. Before the discovery of insulin and hypoglycemic drugs, diabetic patients were treated with medicinal plants and traditional treatments. So far, the positive effects of over 1200 herbal drugs in reducing blood glucose levels or the complications due to hyperglycemia have been established. Each plant may have its own effective component to reduce hyperglycemia. However, these plants have been shown to [31](#272574:6148251) [32](#272574:6148281) [33](#272574:6148250) [34](#272574:6148282) [35](#272574:6148284) [36](#272574:6148242). Oxidative stress is involved in development of diabetes and a lot of other diseases [35](#272574:6148284) [36](#272574:6148242) [37](#272574:6148275) [38](#272574:6148272) [39](#272574:6148246) [40](#272574:6148243). Therefore, these plants, at least in part, impose their anti-diabetic activities through this mechanism. Because oxidative stress is the cause of a wide variety of other disease and these plants have antioxidant activity, hence, they may have beneficial effects on other diseases, too [41](#272574:6148271) [42](#272574:6148247) [43](#272574:6148278) [44](#272574:6148283) [45](#272574:6148266). It is noteworthy that these plants due to their antioxidant activities and other mechanisms are able to reduce the toxic effects of toxic agents or other drugs [46](#272574:6148258). However, they themselves may have toxic effects and might be used with caution [47](#272574:6148244). More importantly a lot of other plans have antioxidant capacity [48](#272574:6148257) [49](#272574:6148248) [50](#272574:6148265). Conclusions Hence, these plants may also have anti-diabetic activities and/or can reduce diabetes complications.
