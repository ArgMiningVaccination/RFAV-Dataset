A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 218A IS CREATED TO 3 READ AS FOLLOWS: 4 The General Assembly finds that: 5 (1) Cannabis's recorded use as a medicine goes back nearly five thousand (5,000) 6 years. Modern medical research has confirmed the beneficial uses for cannabis 7 in treating or alleviating the pain, nausea, and other symptoms associated with a 8 variety of debilita ting medical conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, 9 and HIV/AIDS, as found by the National Academies' Institute of Medicine in 10 March 1999; 11 (2) Studies published since the 1999 Institute of Medicine report have continued to 12 show the therapeutic v alue of cannabis in treating a wide array of debilitating 13 medical conditions. These include relief of the neuropathic pain caused by 14 multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, and other illnesses and injuries that often fail to 15 respond to conventional treatments, and r elief of nausea, vomiting, and other side 16 effects of drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C, increasing the chances 17 of patients continuing on life -saving treatment regimens; 18 (3) Cannabis has many currently accepted medical uses in the United States, having 19 been recommended by thousands of licensed physicians to more than five 20 hundred thousand (500,000) patients in states with medical cannabis laws. 21 Cannabis's medical utility has been recognized by a wide range of medical and 22 public health organization s, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, 23 the American College of Physicians, the American Nurses Association, the 24 American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, and 25 many others; 26 (4) Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigat ion's Uniform Crime Reports and the 27 UNOFFICIAL COPY 17 RS BR 409 Page 2 of 132 BR040900.100 - 409 - XXXX Jacketed Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics show that approximately ninety -nine 1 (99) out of every one hundred (100) cannabis arrests in the United States are 2 made under state law, rather than under federal law. Consequently , changing 3 state law will have the practical effect of protecting from arrest the vast majority 4 of seriously ill patients who have a medical need to use cannabis; 5 (5) The states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, 6 Hawaii, Illin ois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 7 Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, 8 Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of 9 Columbia, have removed state -level criminal penalties from the medical use and 10 cultivation of cannabis. Kentucky joins in this effort for the health and welfare of 11 its citizens; 12 (6) States are not required to enforce federal law or prosecute people for engaging in 13 activities prohibited by federal law. Therefore, compliance with Sections 1 to 29 14 of this Act does not put the state of Kentucky in violation of federal law; and 15 (7) State law should make a distinction between the medical and nonmedical uses of 16 cannabis. Therefore, the purpose of Sections 1 to 29 of this Act is to protect 17 patients with debilitating medical conditions, as well as their practitioners and 18 providers, from arrest and prosecution, criminal and other penalties, and 19 property forfeiture, if such patients engage in the medical use of cannabis. 20 SECTION 2.
