Data Sources and Study Selection: We searched multiple databases through February 2019 for systematic reviews (SRs) of aromatherapy and EOs for health conditions . Using pre -specified inclusion criteria, al l abstracts and full -text articles were dual -screened for inclusion. When there were several qualified reviews for the same health condition, we selected a single review based on its recency, methods, scope, and applicability . Data Abstraction: From each review, we abstracted the focus of the SR, the number of controlled trials included, combined number of participants , duration of trials, condition treated, and relevant findings from controlled trials . We abstracted separate data for each of 5 outcome categories : psychological outcomes, nausea/vomiting, pain and other physical outcomes, sleep outcomes, and global health outcomes. Data Synthesis: For each review and outcome category we assigned values representing the effectiveness level of the interventio n and confidence in the evidence and used these values to generate evidence maps . Additionally, we provide a narrative synthesis of the findings. Results: We included 26 SRs representing the most recent and comprehensive evidence available. There is moderate -confidence evidence that aromatherapy is beneficial for pain in dysmenorrhea . Aromatherapy is potentially effective for pain in labor/childbirth; blood pressure reduction in hypertension; stress, depression , and sleep in hemodialysis patients ; stress in healthy adults; anxiety in perioperative patients; and sleep quality in various populations , with low to moderate confidence in the evidence. For EOs applied topically, there is moderate confidence in the potentially positive effect of tea tree oil for tinea pedis. There is insufficient evidence of efficacy for all other conditions examined. Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION This topic was nominated by Dr. Ben Kligler, National Director of the Integrative Health Coordinating Center (IHCC) and Dr. Peter Glassman, Chair of the Medical Advisory Panel, Pharmacy Benefits Management Services at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The purpose of this report is to provide a broad overview of the effectiveness of aromatherapy and essential oils for v arious health indications . We will summarize the findings of systematic reviews in the form of evidence maps that will be used to guide and support decision -making about these treatment modalities in the VHA. The key question for the evidence map was: What evidence is available that examines the effectiveness of aromatherapy or essential oils for health - related indications? METHODS Data Sources and Searches We developed search strategies in consultation with a research librarian. We searched multiple data sources from database inception through February 2019 for systematic reviews (SRs) and meta -analyses of aromatherapy and essential oils. Study Selection Two investigators independently assessed all abstracts and full -text articles for inclusion using pre-specified selection criteria and resolved disagreements through discussion and consensus. We included SRs and meta -analyses that included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of clinical aromatherapy or topically applied essential oils (EOs) for specific health indications, risk populations, or targeted settings such as healthcare waiting spaces. From these SRs, we excluded results of trials in children, aromatherapy -massage trials without a massage -only control group, and trials that did not control for concurrent interventions. We excluded data from interventions in which EOs were applied to mucos al membranes , either orally, vaginally, or taken via ingestion . Potentially eligible SRs met all the following quality criteria: 1) clearly report ed their search strategy and inclusion criteria; 2) performed a comprehensive search of at least 2 electronic databases; and 3) assessed the included studies for potential risk of bias and reported the findings. When there were several qualified SRs of an intervention for the same health condition, we selected a single review to represent the evidence for that health condition or population, based on recentness, methodological quality, scope, and applicability. Data Abstraction From each SR selected for th e evidence map, we abstracted the following data: targeted health condition or population of the SR, intervention modalities and comparators used among trials, number of eligible RCTs and CCTs, sample size , and findings. Data were abstracted by 1 investiga tor and confirmed by at least 1 additional reviewer. We abstracted outcome data in 6 categories: psychological symptoms, nausea/vomiting, pain and other physical outcomes, global outcomes (specifically measures of functional status or quality Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 3 of life), sleep quality , and adverse effec ts. If the effect sizes or P-va lues for the primary trials were not reported in the SR, we relied on the qualitative summary of findings provided by the SR authors. Quality Assessment To qualify for inclusi on in our evidence map, SRs were required to assess the methodolog ical quality of RCTs using a standardized instrument, among other criteria. We took the adjudications made by the primary SR authors at face value and used their quality assessments to rate the overall body of evidence. Data Synthesis and Rating the Body of Evidence Using the vec tor graphics in Microsoft Excel (2016), we generated scatte r plots representing the findings in 2 dimensions: level of effectiveness and confidence in the evidence. Two reviewers independently assessed the effectiveness of the interventions and confidence levels, based on data from eligible trials as reported in the systematic review s. Each bubble represents the summary of finding s for 1 of 5 outcome categories (psychological, nausea/vomiting, pain or other physical, global, and sleep). We did not include harms in the evidence map because they were seldom reported. See the figure below for the map of the evidence. We classified the effect of the intervention for each health condition and outcome as follows: No effect : a preponderance of null or negative findings. Unclear : the systematic review reported mixed findings for a single outcome, or mixed findings across multiple outcomes within the same category, with no preponderance of either benefit or negative effects. Potential positive effect : multiple outcomes within the same category ( pain/ physical, nauseas/vomiting, psychological, global health, or sleep) with at least 1 clear finding of benefit; or mixe d findings for a single outcome with a preponderance of evidence of a positive effect. Positive effect : numerous studies or a large sample showing a positive effect. We classified the levels of confidence in the evidence as follows: High: Consistent findings from at least 2 studies with a large combined sample size and low risk of bias. Moderate: Evidence comes from a single large study with no major flaws, or from 2+ studies with limitations in sample size, study quality, applicability, or consistency of findings. Low: Small combined sample size, or major deficiencies in the body of evidence. Insufficient: The body of evidence consists of only 1 small study or has unacceptable deficiencies. Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 4 For the evidence maps, we grouped together st udies with either unclear effect or insufficient level of confidence into a combined category of unclear/insufficient evidence . We also provide a narrative synthesis of findings according to treatment modality and outcome. RESULTS Results of Literature S earch Our search of electronic databases, bibliographies, and other sources resulted in a total of 1,646 citations. After dual review of titles , abstracts, and full -text articles, we selected 25 SRs representing the most recent and comprehensive evidence available on each intervention, as applied to distinct health -related conditions and target populations. Summary of Results Twenty -six health -related conditions/target populations were examined by the 25 SRs selected for the evidence map . Twenty -two SRs p rovide evidence on inhaled EO interventions, which encompass aromatherapy combined with massage (EO -massage) as well as inhaled -only aromatherapy . Three SRs provide evidence on topical EO interventions. Evidence from 171 eligible trials is represented amo ng the 25 SRs . Hemodialysis, perioperative patients, dysmenorrhea, labor/childbirth, sleep, anxiety, and depression were the most widely studied conditions and/or populations. Aromatherapy interventions were most commonly delivered via inhalation, though the method of application varied widely. SRs of aromatherapy frequently included trials of aromatherapy -massage, which may involve direct dermal exposure through the addition of EO to massage lotion or oil or may be diffused in the room during massage . There is moderate -confidence evidence that inhaled EOs are beneficial for pain in dysmenorrhea. Inhaled EOs have potential benefit for pain in labor/childbirth (moderate confidence) and for blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension (low confidenc e). Two SRs provided low-confidence evidence of potential positive effects on sleep quality in various populations. There is moderate-confidence evidence that aromatherapy has no effect on anxiety in palliative care. The effects of inhaled EOs are unclear for nausea/vomiting in all studied populations, and for all other conditions studied. Among the topical EO interventions, there is evidence of potential effectiveness in the use of tea tree oil for tinea pedis and the level of confidence in the evidence is moderate. The effectiveness of topical EOs is unclear for onychomycosis, acne, and episiotomy wound healing. Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 5 Figure. Map of the evidence from systematic reviews of inhaled and topical essential oils for targeted health conditions/populations Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 6 DISCUSSION These evidence maps provide a broad overview of the evidence on clinical aromatherapy and topical EO interventions. The only condition for which we found a preponderance of evidence suggesting benefit was pain in dysmenorrhea. We found severa l potentially promising areas, including pain in labor/ childbirth; blood pressure reduction in those with hypertension; stress, depression , and sleep in patients on hemodialysis; stress in healthy adults; anxiety in perioperative patients undergoing variou s surgery types; and sleep quality in various populations . We also found evidence of potential effectiveness in the use of topical tea tree oil for tinea pedis . In most of the conditions studied, however, we found insufficient evidence to characterize treatment effects . Limitations Evidence maps such as these are not designed to provide definitive conclusions about benefit, and there are several reasons for cautious interpretation: 1) we relied only on SRs and did not search for more recently published trials or conditions for which no SR has been written (so we cannot be definitive in our characterization of the evidence for each condition, nor is this an exhaustive list of conditions/populations for which aromatherapy has been used), 2) we cannot comm ent on the magnitude of treatment effect, 3) we relied on others' study quality assessments, and 4) our measure of the level of confidence cannot approach the rigor represented by standardized approaches1 given the previously listed constraints. These maps provide only broad \"brushstrokes\" regarding the potential benefits of these interventions. One should be particularly circumspect about the \"potential for positive effect\" findings since these were - by design - weighted toward identifying any potential area of benefit to aid with research prioritization. Similarly, evidence maps provide a broad overview about evidence gaps, but cannot be definitive in determining an absence of evidence. Data for these evidence maps came from systematic reviews ; therefore, individual trials not included in prior reviews or areas for which there were no reviews meeting inclusion criteria are not represented in these evidence maps. It is possible that the maps have identified area s of insufficient evidence in which there is individual trial data, or systematic reviews that did not meet our minimum quality criteria. Research Gaps/Future Research The maps highlight many potential areas for future research. The interventions and heal th conditions for which there was evidence of a \"potential positive effect\" may be one place to start to prioritize research, since these findings underscore potentially fruitful areas of research. The comparative effectiveness of different, standardized a romatherapeutic approaches should be examined especially in conditions for which there is potential promise. Future studies should capture potential adverse effects data, and the safety of aromatherapy should be examined in patients with comorbidities espe cially those of the respiratory tract. Furthermore, the use of a non-EO fragrance comparator would improve blinding and allow comparison of effects and harms of aromatherapy containing EO versus synthetically generated fragrance oils. CONCLUSIONS There i s moderate confidence that aromatherapy is effective for pain in dysmenorrhea. We found potential positive effects of aromatherapy for pain in labor/ childbirth; blood pressure reduction in Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 7 those with hypertension; stress, depression , and sleep in patients on hemodialysis; stress in healthy adults; anxiety in perioperative patients undergoing various surgery types; and sleep quality in various populations , with low to moderate confidence in the evidence. For EOs applied topically, there is moderate confidenc e in the potentially positive effect of tea tree oil for tinea pedis. There is insufficient evidence with which to determine whether aromatherapy or topically applied EO is effective for all other examined conditions.

The use of various low-risk complementary and alternative health interventions has been increasing both within and outside of the VHA. Essential oils (EOs) are part of a tradition of herbal medicine dating back thousands of years.2 EOs are volatile oils that contain the \"essence\" of an aromatic pl ant's fragrance . Conventional methods for extracting EOs include steam or water distillation from raw plant material ,3 or cold - press extraction from citrus peel.4 The therapeutic inhalation of EOs is thought to have physiological and/or psychological benefits.5 Aromatherapy using EO is thought to mediate emotional response s by affecting the neuroendocrine system and autonomic nervous systems .6 In addition to the inhalation of EOs, there are various topical applications that are purported to be beneficial apart fro m their aromatic qualities, for instance as antiseptics. The chemical components of EOs have been shown to inhibit microbial and fungal growth.7,8 EO aromatherapy is being used increasingly in hospitals and other healthcare settings .9,10 For instance, a romatherapy ha s been used to help manage the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, such as restlessness and aggression, and to improve sleep .11 Despite their increasing use, little is known about the benefits and risks associated with the use of EOs. The purp ose of this report is to provide a broad overview , using evidence maps, of the health conditions and target populations for which EO interventions have been studied . Evidence maps are a relatively new form of evidence synthesis, and their purpose is to ide ntify research gaps and future research needs, rather than to conduct comprehensive, in -depth analyses or form conclusions about a focused research question. Although standardized definitions and methodology are still being established, an evidence map generally include s a systematic search of a broad field of research and a visual representation of the body of literature .12 This report and evidence map characterize the current knowledge about the effectiveness of inhaled and topical EOs and will inform decision -making about these modalities in the VHA. Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 10 METHODS TOPIC DEVELOPMENT This topic was nominated by Dr. Peter Glassman, Chair of the Medical Advisory Panel, Pharmacy Benefits Management Service, in conjunction with Dr. Benjamin Kligler, National Director for the Integrative Health Coordinating Center, Patient -Centered Care & Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT) . The scope was refine d through a process that included a preliminary review of published peer -reviewed literature and consultation s with our operational partners and a panel of technical experts . The research question for th is evidence map was: What evidence i s available that examines the effectiveness of aromatherapy or essential oils for health - related indications ? Our approach to the research question is shown below in Figure 1. Figure 1. Analytic framework SEARCH ST RATEGY We conducted a comprehensive search for systematic reviews (SRs) and meta -analyses of EO interventions . We consulted with a research librarian to develop the search strateg y, and a second research librarian peer-reviewed the search strategy using the instrument for Peer Review of Search Strategi es.13 The search of electronic databases queried Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In -Process & Other Non -Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily and MEDLINE, HL, Epistomonikos, Ovid EBM Reviews Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR, D ARE, HTA, and Cochrane CENTRAL ), and includ ed all available years of publication from database inception (1946 for Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae) through February 2019 ; Appendix A prov ides the search strategies for each database . We further examined the bibliographies of relevant publications , search ed the PROSPERO registry for Essential oils administered topically or via inhalation (aromatherapy ) Adults of a defined risk group or targeted health condition Physical outcomes Harms Global health outcomes Psychological outcomes Sleep outcomes Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 11 completed systematic reviews, and consulted subject matter experts for potentially relevant studies . STUDY SELECTION We applied pre-specified selection criteria (Appendix B) to assess the titles and abstracts yielded by the literature search . We used Abstrackr ,14 an online tool for screening citations, and retrieved potentially relevant articles for review at the full -text level. Two investigators independently assessed all abstracts and full -text articles for inclusion and resolved disagreements through discussion and consensus . We selected SRs and meta -analyses that included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of clinical aromatherapy or topically applied essential oils for specific health indications , risk populations , or targeted settings such as healthcare waiting spaces . We exclude d reviews examining only children or adolescents . If an eligible SR included both pediatric and adult populations, we abstracted data from only the trials in adults. We classified aromatherapy -massage (EO -massage) as an inhaled modality, and only included data from trials that included a massage -only control group. We similarly included data from 1 trial of aromatherapy combined with acup ressure that included an acup ressure -only control group. We excluded data from trials that did not control for concurrent interventions. We excluded data from interventions in which oral or mucous membranes made dir ect contact with EOs, such as mouth rinses, vaginal applications, or orally ingested EO formulations. Table 1 specifies t he criteria for population, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, and setting (PICOTS) . Table 1. PICOTS Key Question What evidence is available on the effectiveness of aromatherapy or essential oils for health -related conditions? In which health conditions/target populations have they been studied? Which formulations have been studied? What is the effect of the intervention in each health condition studied? 4 effect categories: No effect Unclear Potential positive Positive What is the level of confidence in the evidence for that effect? 4 confidence levels: Insufficient Low Moderate High Population Adults (18+) receiving an EO intervention for a targeted health condition or risk group . Interventions Include: Essential oil preparations that are inhaled or topically applied ; massage with EO is included as an inhaled modality. Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 12 Exclude: Essential oil preparations that are ingested , consumed , or absorbed through oral and mucosal membranes. Also exclude preparations where essential oils are combined with another drug or active ingredient . Comparators No limits for comparators of inhaled -only EO interventions . For EO -massage interventions, include only data from trials that had a massage -only comparator arm ( eg, using an inert/carrier oil) . Outcomes Psychological symptoms Physical outcomes Global outcomes ( measures of quality of life or function, such as activities of daily living, mobility, social functioning, and employment) Harms Timing Any duration of treatment and follow -up Study design Systematic reviews and meta -analyses that include randomized controlled trials. Non - systematic r eviews, reviews of reviews, and primary studies are excluded. Setting No limits Potentially eligible SRs met all the following quality criteria: 1) clearly reported their search strategy and inclusion criteria; 2) performed a comprehensive search of at least 2 electronic databases; and 3) assessed the included studies for potential risk of bias and reported the findings.15 We identified the distinct health conditions and target populations that were examined by the potentially eligible SRs. When there were several qualified SRs of an intervention for the same health condition, we selected a single review to represent the evidence for that health condition or population, based on recentness, methodological quality, scope, and applicability. DATA ABSTRACTION From each SR selected for the evidence ma p, we abstracted the following data: targeted health condition or population of the SR, intervention modalit ies and comparators used among eligible trials , number of RCTs and CCTs, sample size , and findings . Data were abstracted by 1 investigator and confi rmed by at least 1 additional reviewer. Some of the SRs selected for the evidence map examined a range of complementary therapies for a targeted health condition or included trials of EO interventions that we excluded from our scope, such as orally ingeste d formulations, or trials comparing EO-massage v ersus usual care . We abstracted data from trials that met our PICOTS criteria (Table 1). We abstracted outcome data in 6 categories: ps ychological symptoms, nausea/vomiting, pain and other physical outcomes , global outcomes (specifically measures of function al status or quality of life) , sleep quality , and adverse effects. If the effect sizes or P -values for the primary trials were not reported in the SR, we relied on the qualitative summary of findings provid ed by the SR authors. QUALITY ASSESSMENT To qualify for inclusion in our evidence map, SRs were required to assess the methodological quality of RCTs using a standardized instrument, among other criteria .15 We took t he Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 13 adjudications made by the primary SR authors at face value and used their quality assessments to rate the overall body of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS We used the vector graphics in Microsoft Excel (2016) to generate scatter plots based on categorical values representing levels of effect and confidence in the evidence . The rows in the scatter plot s present each of 26 health con ditions/target populations . Each bubble represents the summary of findings for 1 of 5 outcome categories ( psychological, nausea/vomiting, pain or other physical outcomes , global, and sleep ). Because harms were infrequently reported, they are not represente d in the evidence maps. Two reviewers independently assessed the effect iveness of the interventions and confidence levels , based on data from eligible trials as reported in the systematic reviews . We resolved disagreements through discussion or by consulti ng a third reviewer until we reached consensus. We classified the effect of the intervention for each targeted health condition and outcome as follows : No effect : a preponderance of null or negative findings. Unclear : the systematic review reported mixed f indings for a single outcome , or mixed findings across multiple outcomes within the same category, with no preponderance of either benefit or negative effects . Potential positive effect : multiple outcomes within the same category (physical, psychological, global health, or sleep) with at least 1 clear finding of benefit; or mixed findings for a single outcome with a preponderance of evidence of a positive effect among RCTs . Positive effect : numerous studies or a large sample showing a positive effect . For a modality t o be classified as having a positive effect required consistent, statistically significant effects from well -conducted trials . When there were mixed findings for a single outcome that included both positive and null findings, we classified the overall effect as either unclear or potential ly positive , depending on the preponderance of findings particularly among RCTs . If the findings across a group of studies were truly mixed to the extent that there was no preponderance of evidence in 1 directi on or another , or if there were methodological limitations in the included trials , we classified it as unclear/insufficient . However, if there were a clear signal for benefit on at least 1 outcome in a category , we classified the overall body of evidence as having a potential positive effect . We provide a narrative synthesis of findings according to treatment modality and outcome . Some SRs of inhaled EOs focused on a specific outcome such as nausea or sleep quality . Other SRs examined a specific health cond ition and reported multiple outcomes . We therefore compiled the findings for similar outcomes, grouping together psychological outcomes, nausea/vomiting, pain and other physical signs/symptoms, global outcomes, sleep quality, and adverse effects . Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 14 RATING T HE BODY OF EVIDENCE For each conclusion on the effect of an intervention ( ie, no effect, unclear, potential positive, or positive effect) we characterized the level o f confidence in the body of evidence specific to th at outcome category and health -related condition . We calculated a rough estimate of confidence based on the number of participants in the included trials; the number of studies; the quality of the included trials , and the overall risk of bias; whether there were serious inconsistencies in the findings; and any limitations in the applicability of the evidence (Appendix C). Table 2 outlines the criteria we used for scoring. Table 2. D omains for assessing level of confidence Domain; range of points Description Sample size; 1 to 3 1: N 100 2: N = 100 -500 3: N = 500+ Number of studies; -1 or 0 0: More than 1 study -1: Only 1 study Consistency; -1 or 0 0: No major flaw -1: Serious inconsistency Directness; -1 or 0 0: No major flaw -1: Limited applicability Overall ROB/study quality; -1 or 0 0: Unclear or low ROB (good quality) -1: High ROB (poor quality) ROB = Risk of bias We used the sum of points from each domain to classify the level of confidence into 4 categories as follows : (3 points ) High : Consistent findings from at least 2 studies with a large combined sample size and low risk of bias. (2 points ) Moderate : Evidence comes from a single large study with no major flaws , or from 2+ studies with limitations in sample size, study quality, applicability, or consistency of findings. (1 point) Low: Small combined sample size , or major deficiencies in the body of evidence. ( 0 points ) Insufficient: The body of evidence consists of only 1 small study or has unacceptable deficiencies . For the evidence maps, we grouped together studies with either unclear effect or insufficient level of confidence into a combined category of unclear/ insufficient evidence . Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 15 RESULTS LITERATURE FLOW Our search of electronic databases, bibliographies, and other sources resulted in a total of 1,646 citations. After reviewing titles and abstracts, we included 171 for further screening at the full -text level. Of these, 56 SRs met our inclusion criteria. After reviewing all eligible SRs, we selected 25 SRs representing the most recent and comprehensive evidence available on each health -related condition and/or population (Figure 2 ).

Twenty -six health -related conditions/target populations were examined by the 25 SRs selected for the evidence map . Twenty-two SRs provide evidence on inhaled EO interventions ,16-37 which encompass aromatherapy combined with massage (EO-massage) as well as inhaled -only aromatherapy . Three SRs provide evidence on topical EO interventions.38-40 One SR of topical EOs for various fungal infections included both tinea pedis and onychomycosis, and we present the findings for these health condition s separately. Figure 3 shows the number of trials for each health condition according to treatment modality . Evidence from 171 eligible trials is represented among the 25 SRs . Hemodialysis, perioperative patients, dysmenorrhea, labor/childbirth, sleep, an xiety, and depression were the most widely studied conditions /populations . Aromatherapy interventions were most often delivered via inhalation, though the method of application varied widely. Inhaled EO studies used a range of administration methods: the E O could be released to the air by diffus ion or vaporization , applied to cotton and attached to the subject 's clothing, inhal ed directly from a vessel, appli ed to the inside of a ventilation mask, or added to the lotion /oil used during massage - all of these were commonly described as aromatherapy . SRs of aromatherapy frequently included trials of aromatherapy -massage (Figure 3), which may involve direct dermal exposure through the addition of EO to massage lotion /oil or may be limited to inhalation only if the EO is diffused in the room during massage . In many cases the SR referred to the intervention simply as \"aromatherapy -massage\" without specifying whether the exposure was administered via massage oil or diffuser . When details of the methods of the E O-massage trials were provided, dermal contact was the most commonly described exposure method. Table 3 specifies the outcomes reported for each health condition/target population. The results for these outcomes are presented in Figure 4 , a map of the evid ence for inhaled EO interventions in 22 health conditions . There is evide nce that inhaled EO s are beneficial for pain in dysmenorrhea,23 and the level of confidence in the evidence i s moderate . Inhaled EO s have potential benefit for physical symptoms during labor/childbirth26 (moderate confidence) and for patients with hypertension25 (low confidence) . Two SRs p rovided low -confidence e vidence of a potential positive effect s on sleep qualit y.24,35 There is moderate -confidence evidence that aromatherapy has no effect on anxiety in palliative care .18 The effects of inhaled EOs are unclear for nausea/vomiting , and for all other conditions studied. Figure 5 presents an evidence map for the effects of topical E O interventions for 4 health conditions . There is evidence of potential effectiveness in the use of topical tea tree oil for tinea pedis,40 and the level of confidence in the evidence is moderate . The effectiveness of topical EO s is unclear for onychomycosis , acne, and episiotomy wound healing. Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 17 Table 3.

Map of the evidence from systematic reviews of inhaled essential oils for targeted health conditions/populations Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 21 Inhaled EO interventions - Psychological outcomes Seven SRs examined the effects of inhaled EO s on anxiety and reported mixed findings . Table 4 provides a summary of the findings . An SR of hemodialysis patients found potential positive effects on anxiety, depression, and stress,24 and an SR of perioperative patients found a potential positive effect on reducing anxiety .31 The level of confidence in these findings was low . A meta - analysis of 3 RCTs found no effect on anxiety in palliative care (low confidence).18 Evidence of effectiveness for anxiety was unclear for waiting room setting s,17 burn patients,20 cancer,21 hemodialysis,24 women aged 45+,32 and in a n SR of various populations.19 Of 3 SRs that examined stress, 2 found evidence of a potential positive effect (low confidence) in healthy adults36 and hemodialysis patients .24 Evidence of effect was unclear in a n SR of occupational stress among nurses.37 The effects of inhaled EO interventions on depression, behavioral problems in dementia, and other psychological outcomes wer e also unclear (Table 4).

Table 6 provides a summary of the findings . An SR of dysmenorrhea found statistically significant effects on pain reduction in a meta -analysis of 7 RCTs e was significant heterogeneity in both analyses.23 The overall effect was positive and the level of confidence was moderat e, in part due to the large number of trials (17) and combined sample size (N=1,534) . There was evidence of a potential positive effect on labor pain,26 and the level of confidence was moderate . Inhaled EO was associated with reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension, based on evidence from a small high -ROB RCT and 4 CCTs.25 Given limitations in the study methods, we rated the evidence of effectiveness for hypertension as potential positive, with a low level of confidence .

Table 7 provides a summary of the findings . Potential positive effects were reported in 2 SRs . Evidence of effectiveness in 2 other SRs was unclear . An SR of inhaled EO in hemodialysis patients provided evidence from 4 trials that suggested a potential positive effect on sleep quality,24 though the confidence in the evidence was low . Another SR examined the use of aromatherapy for sleep promotion in a variety of populations that included patients with a health condition as well as healthy volunteers .35 Among the 9 trials identified, 6 reported statistically significant improvements in sleep quality . The preponderance of benefit suggests a potential positive effect, although methodological limitations in the trials rendered the level o f confidence low . An SR of non -pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in critical care patients identified 1 RCT (N=25) of aromatherapy, and found no evidence of benefit.34 Because the evidence is based on only 1 small trial, the level of confidence in this finding is unclear/insufficient . An SR of aromatherapy for symptom relief in burn patients provided data from an RCT comparing lavender with music therapy, which also provided unclea r evidence of effectiveness.20 Table 7.

A n SR of aromatherapy for dementia16 reported adverse effects from 2 trials of EO -massage: In a n RCT of 114 patients, 2 patients treated with massage using Melissa oil had unspecified serious adverse events; and 1 small RCT (N=7) reported the occurrence of allergic reactions from EO -massage (number of patients not specified), and 1 participant reported drowsiness. Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 33 Topical EO interventions Three SRs o f topical EO interventions provided evidence on acne,38 fungal infections,40 and wound healing in episiotomy .39 Figure 5 and Table 9 present the findings on effectiveness and harms . The SR of fungal infections,40 reported mixed findings with a preponderance of benefit in 3 trials of topical EO s for treating tinea pedis . The overall evid ence suggested a potential positive effect, and the level of confidence was moderate . The same SR included a trial of tea tree oil v ersus clotrimazole for onychomycosis, the findings of which were inconclusive. Significantly positive findings for acne38 and wound healing in episiotomy39 were reported, but because in each case the evidence was based on a single trial (N<100), the level of confidence was insufficient . The overall effect was therefore rated un clear for these health conditions. Figure 5.

We systematically searched the literatur e for SRs and meta -analyses of these interventions, and we included 25 SRs examining these interventions across a variety of targeted health -related conditions and populations. We compiled evidence maps to illustrate the reported effects of each interventi on in the populations studied. The only condition for which we found a preponderance of evidence suggesting benefit was pain in dysmenorrhea . This was o ne of the best -studied conditions and we found evidence of positive effects on pain in dysmenorrhea with inhaled EOs with and without massage , with moderate confidence . We found several areas where EOs are potentially promising for particular populations and/or conditions - including labor/childbirth, hypertension, hemodialysis, stress, perioperative care, and sleep quality - in which inhaled EOs were inconsistently associated with positive effects across studies or across ou tcomes within a given domain ( eg, positive effects for 1 measured psychological outcome but not another, or positive effects in some st udies but not a majority) . We also found evidence of potential effectiveness in the use of topical tea tree oil for tinea pedis . However, w e found insufficient evidence to character ize treatment effects in most of the conditions studied . The most common r easons we rated evidence as insufficient was a simple pauci ty of trials, small sample size s, and methodologic limitations of the studies . On the other hand, aside from low -confidence evidence examining aromatherapy for anxiety in palliative care patients, we found very little evidence with which to characterize aromatherapy as ineffective . In other words, in broad terms, the literature examining aromatherapy does not yet appear to provide enough information to determine whether it has any effects for most c onditions . One challenge in interpreting and applying the aromat herapy literature is the variation in interventions across studies . There are many sources of intervention variation: the compounds used for aromatherapy, their concentrations, the equipment through which they are delivered, the frequency and duration of their application, their combination with co -interventions like massage , and the inhalation instructions provided to patien ts. In this evidence map, we were unable to determine the comparative effectiveness of different aromatherapy interventions for different conditions . Applying this evidence to clinical settings in the United States is also complicated by the lack of regula tory oversight and standardization of these interventions . Determining how much of an intervention's effect iveness is a direct effect of the specific intervention and how much is due to the placebo effect may be less important if the intervention is low cost and has few adverse effects . The costs and cost -effectiveness of EO interventions were beyond the scope of our review, though compared with conventional treatments these are generally considered low-cost interventions . Inhaled -only and topical EO inter ventions could be administered by a variety of providers in a range of settings , whereas massage would add cost and specialization on the part of the provider.41,42 We have very little data about adverse effects from the included reviews , as they were seldom reported . Sensitive populations, such as those with asthma or allergies, may be at potentially greater risk of adverse effects from inhaled or topical EO interventions.43-45 Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 36 Limitations There are several limitations related to e vidence map methodology and related to the body of evidence itself . These e vidence maps provide a broad overview of the existing evidence compiled by SRs. These maps provide only broad \"brushstrokes\" regarding the potential benefits of these interventions. Evidence maps such as these are not designed to provide definitive conclusions about benefit, and there are several reasons for cautious interpretati on: 1) we relied only on SRs and did not search for more recently published trials or conditions for which no SR has been written (so we cannot be definitive in our characterization of the evidence for each condition , nor is this an exhaustive list of cond itions/populations for which aromatherapy has been used ), 2) we cannot comment on the magnitude of treatment effect, 3) we relied on others' study quality assessments, and 4) our measure of the level of confidence cannot approach the rigor represented by s tandardized approaches46 given the previously listed constraints. One should be particularly circumspect about the \"potential for positive effect\" findings since these were - by design - weighted toward identifying any potential area of benefit to aid with research prioritization . The body of evidence was itself limited in many ways . Many studies in the reviews were rated as having a high risk of bias because they failed to report quantitative measures, used inadequate placebos, or because the interventions were not well standardized . One explanation for the poor study quality provided by some practitioners of aromatherapy is that it does not lend itse lf well to standardization in the trial setting, because usual practice involves a great degree of personalization of dosage, dilution, and scent.22,35 The authors of the included reviews often noted insufficient patient blinding or the use of a non -odor placebo . Attention controls were seldom used. There were also limitations within the SRs included in this report. Several SRs did not report effect sizes or p -values, stating only the pres ence or absence of a treatment effect, and whether the finding of difference was statistically significant . We relied on the reporting of the systematic reviews; therefore, it is possible that primary trials included in these reviews reported more detailed analyses, but this would not have been reflected in our report . Research Gaps/Future Research The maps highlight many potential areas for future research. The interventions and health conditions for which there was evidence of a \"potential positive effect\" may be one place to start to prioritize research, since these findings underscore potentially fruitful areas of research. The comparative effectiveness of different, standardized aromatherapeutic approaches should be examined especially in conditions for which there is potential promise . Future studies should capture potential adverse effects data, and the safety of aromatherapy should be examined in patients with comorbidities especially those of the respiratory tract. The use of a non -EO fragrance comparator would improve blinding and allow comparison of effects and harms of aromatherapy containin g EO versus synthetically generated fragrance oils. CONCLUSIONS There is moderate confidence that aromatherapy is effective for pain in dysmenorrhea. We found potential positive effects of aromatherapy for pain in labor/childbirth ; blood pressure reducti on in those with hypertension ; stress, depression , and sleep in patients on hemodialysis ; stress in Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 37 healthy adults; anxiety in perioperative patients undergoing various surgery types; and sleep quality in various populations , with low to moderate confidenc e in the evidence . For EOs applied topically, there is moderate confidence in the potentially positive effect of tea tree oil for tinea pedis . There is insufficient evidence with which to determine whether aromatherapy or topically applied EOs is effective for all other examined conditions .

PEER REVIEW COMMENTS/AUTHOR RESPONSES Reviewer Number Reviewer Comment Author Response Are the objectives, scope, and methods for this review clearly described? 1 Yes 2 Yes 3 Yes 4 Yes 5 Yes 7 Yes Is there any indication of bias in our synthesis of the evidence? 1 No 2 No 3 Yes - The report states that it \"included 25 SRs examining these interventions across a variety of targeted health - related conditions and populations\" which one expects would mean that conditions as well as the population/s will be described. However, the report goes onto describing \"several potentially promising areas - including labor/childbirth, hypertension, hemodialysis, stress, perioperative care, and insomnia.\" In this list, the report aggregates conditions and populations as if they were comparable items. For example, you may find a SR on labor/delivery population, but what you are really looking for is the effect of an intervention (i.e. aromatherapy) on a certain condition/symptom (i.e. anxiety) on a specific population (i.e. women undergoing labo r/delivery). Therefore, the graphic provided as \"map\" reflects this same confusion regarding the evidence. For example, see Figure 1. Map of the evidence from systematic reviews of inhaled and topical essential oils for targeted health conditions/populatio ns. In this figure, you see a list under the title \"Inhaled EO Interventions\" that includes: We agree that the heterogeneity in the labels used for health condition/population categories presents a challenge. We have added a table to define the specific outcomes for each population, with additional notes about the study samples. We have also relabeled the categories to specify symptoms or outcomes that were targeted by the intervention - for example, \"SBP/DBP , hypertension \" instead of simply \"Hypertension\" indicates that the condition treated was blood pressure, and not some other type of condition such as stress . 3 [Continued from above] Anxiety in palliative care populations [this seems correct, it describes \"Inhaled EO Interventions\" on a certain condition/symptom (i.e. anxiety), on a specific population (i.e. palliative care patients) Agree. No change was made. 3 [Cont.] Burn patients - this seems to be missing information that would make the analysis helpful, as it describes \"Inhaled EO Interven tions\" on a specific population (i.e. burn patients) but does not explain for what condition/symptom (i.e. anxiety). How is one supposed to understand the information? We know that the same intervention may have evidence for one symptom/condition, but not for another. Replaced with \"Symptom relief, burn patients\" 3 [Cont.] Cancer - Same as above, this seems to be missing information that would make the analysis helpful, as it describes \"Inhaled EO Interventions\" on a specific population (i.e. cancer patien ts) but does not explain for what condition/symptom (i.e. anxiety? Pain? Nausea?). How is one supposed to understand the information? I am having a hard time understanding what the information is that the report is conveying to a clinician who is trying to identify what Replaced with \"Symptom relief, cancer patients\" Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 57 to recommend to his/her patients asking if they could try aromatherapy for a certain symptom. 3 [Cont.] Hemodialysis patients - Same as above, this seems to be missing information that would make the analysis helpful, as it describes \"Inhaled EO Interventions\" on a specific population (i.e. Hemodialysis patients) but does not explain for what condition/symp tom (i.e. pruritus? Pain? fatigue?). when analyzing the literature, the evidence may be existing for some symptoms and not for others or may be of different quality for one symptom than another symptom. We have relabeled the category to read, \"Complication s, hemodialysis patients\" 3 [Cont.] Similarly, in the conclusions, the report states: \"There is moderate confidence that aromatherapy is effective for pain in dysmenorrhea. We found potential positive effects of aromatherapy for labor/childbirth [populati on missing condition/s], insomnia [condition, missing popula tion/s], with low to moderate confidence in the evidence.\" According to the data abstraction paragraph in the report, this should be possible to do with the data abstracted. I also looked at the actual SRs on PubMed and all SRs included provide a list of the symptoms/conditions, so it is unclear why the report does not specify them (i.e. Bouya et al, 2018: The results showed that aromatherapy reduced some of the complications of hemodialysis, including anxiety, fatigue, pruritus, pain of arteriovenous fist ula puncture, sleep quality, depression, stress and headache). Agree, as above. We have more clearly noted the targeted conditions/ symptoms and populations in Table 3. 4 No 5 No 7 No Are there any published or unpublished studies that we may have overlooked? 1 No 2 No 3 No 4 No 5 Yes - Fismer and Pilkington (2012). Lavender and sleep. Europen J Integrative medicine. Lakhan, Sheafer and Tepper (2016) Effectiveness of aromatherapy in reducing pain. Pain Research & Treatment. This systematic review may not have met all your criteria as I don't see a rigorous review of risk of bias. Thank you for bringing the Fismer review to our attent ion. It was not captured by our search. We have reviewed it, and all the studies it included (minus 1 dissertation by Borromeo) were also included in the more recent review by Lillehei and Halcon which is included in this evidence map. The Lakhan review, while captured in our search, did not meet our criteria due to lack of ROB assessment. 7 No Additional suggestions or comments can be provided below. If applicable, please indicate the page and line numbers from the draft report. 1 2 Really excellent job Thank you! Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Evidence Synthesis Program 58 3 it will be helpful to consistently report in the same format for all SRs, including the intervention, condition/symptom and population Agree - we have relabeled the categories for greater consistency and added Table 3 to clarify the conditions/symptoms and populations. 4 The report was complete and accurate within its scope. I assume that the criteria used are standard criteria for any health care intervention, but I wondered if other clinical intervention studies wo uld normally have sample sizes of over 500 in order to be judged adequate. The authors were very clear about the limitations of the report given the paucity of systematic reviews. They also were clear that they did not evaluate the individual studies inclu ded in the reviews. However, I would recommend in the future adding a column to the review tool addressing whether the SR authors addressed product integrity indicators (Latin name, chemotype, GC/MS analysis) in their review. For the sample size criteria ( 500+), we combined samples from all trials that reported the outcome of interest. The excellent suggestion to capture product integrity indicators is noted. Because we relied on evidence from systematic reviews rather than primary studies, product informa tion was generally absent. We captured data about EO type and concentration when available, but even this information was sparsely reported. 5 7 "}
