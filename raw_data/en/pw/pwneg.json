Nobles,1Eric C. Leas,2Mark Dredze,3John W.

While these services represent a new mode of healthcare delivery, study of these online health communities and how they are used is limited. In particular, it is unknown if these platforms replicate existing barriers and biases in traditional healthcare delivery across demographic groups. We present an analy- sis of AskDocs, a subreddit that functions as a public AtD platform on social media. We examine the demographics of users, the health topics discussed, if biases present in offline healthcare settings exist on this platform, and how empathy is expressed in interactions between users and physicians. Our ndings suggest a number of implications to enhance and support peer-to-peer and patient-provider interactions on on- line platforms. Introduction People increasingly turn to online sources for health infor- mation and advice (Antheunis, Tates, and Nieboer 2013a; Amante et al. 2015)) and there is strong demand for online communication with physicians (NIH National Cancer In- stitute 2014). One modality to communicate with physicians online is Ask the Doctor (AtD) services. AtD services allow people to connect and obtain information and advice from physicians without a previously established relationship. For example, Fenda, a commercial Chinese Q&A platform, al- lows patients to ask a question and receive a one-minute voicemail response from a physician (Ma et al. 2018). As online health care grows understanding how these ser- vices differ from traditional physician-patient interactions will be critical to ensuring high quality care. Reddit pro- vides an avenue for studying this new healthcare modal- ity. Established in July 2013 the subreddit r/AskDocs facili- tates AtD services through an online community peo- ple can access information from moderator-veried physi- cians cannot provide all the ben- ets of a traditional setting (e.g., medical testing) or com- mercial AtD infrastructure (e.g., selecting a physician to re- Copyright c 2020, Association for the Advancement of Articial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.spond) provide, it has the advantages of being free, conve- nient with 24-7 access, and provides pseudo-anonymity, all within an existing popular social media interface. The public format enables study of the emerging AtD landscape. Health disparities are a particularly interesting aspect that may differ between traditional and AtD healthcare delivery. Racial, ethnic, and gender minorities - regardless of their insurance status, income, age, and severity of conditions - often have less access to health care than their counter- parts. Even with access, minorities frequently receive lower quality care with worse health outcomes than their counter- parts for similar health issues. Despite substantial efforts to close this gap (e.g., insurance reforms and promoting greater workforce diversity) barriers and bias persist and contribute to a gap of unmet healthcare needs (Hardeman, Medina, and Kozhimannil 2016). This paper examines how the public and physicians are leveraging publicly available social media for AtD services, and if biases present in traditional healthcare settings tran- scend mediums into this online community. Our analysis considers four research questions. RQ1: What are the self-reported demographics (gen- der/sex and race/ethnicity) of posters on r/AskDocs? automatically extract self-reported gender/sex and race/ethnicity from posts. RQ2: What health topics do posters commonly ask about on r/AskDocs and how does this vary across demo- graphics? We conduct a topic model analysis and examine how topics vary across demographics using odds ratios. RQ3: Does receipt of a response in general or by a physician vary across demographics? We examine the as- sociation between demographics and the probability of re- ceiving at least one response (in general and by a physician) using logistic regression. RQ4: Does the empathy of response(s) by a peer or a physician vary across demographics or health top- ics? We examine variation in empathetic responses among the posters' demographics and health topics using language style matching (LSM). We contextualize our ndings using previous works on online AtD services, bias and barriers in traditional health care settings, and peer-to-peer and patient-provider interac-tions in the health information exchange. We discuss impli- cations to facilitate these organic interactions on a publicly available social media setting. Ethics and Privacy. Our research was exempted from an ethics review by the University of California San Diego Hu- man Research Protections Program and Johns Hopkins Uni- versity Institutional Review Board. However, given the sen- sitivity of the topics discussed and vulnerable groups par- ticipating in r/AskDocs, we adhere to suggested data pro- tections (Benton, Coppersmith, and Dredze 2017) including modifying quotes to avoid reverse identication (Ayers et al. 2018). Related Work Barriers and Biases in Traditional Health Care Affordability About half of Reddit users live in the United States (US) (Alexa 2019). The US is the only high-income country without a publicly nanced universal health system (Squires and Anderson 2015), and one-third of people (43% of low-income families) reported costs impeded access to health care (Osborn et al. 2016). Moreover, one-third of the 23 million uninsured US adults report forgoing necessary medical care in the past year because of costs (Hero et al. 2016). Convenience and Accessibility Many US adults are un- able to procure timely medical appointments (Liaw et al. 2019; Uscher-Pines and Mehrotra 2014), waiting an average of 24 days to see a physician (Team 2017). Travel and sched- ule availability create additional barriers with the time bur- den for racial/ethnic minorities averaging 25% longer (Ray et al. 2015). Stigma Internalized or experienced stigma can hinder people from seeking health care assistance (Link 1987; Eisenberg et al. 2009; Scambler and Hopkins 1986; Haus- mann et al. 2011). In lieu of face-to-face health care, people often turn to the internet to look for health information when they perceive stigmatization (Zhang 2014). Biases in Healthcare Delivery Patients with similar con- ditions, but differing social categorizations, often experience differences in the health care that they receive (Gengler and Jarrell 2015; Bailey et al. 2017; Homan 2019). For example, women and racial minorities receive less pain relief (Pryma 2017; Meghani, Byun, and Gallagher 2012) and Hispan- ics and blacks are less likely to receive the most effective forms of pain relief (Meghani, Byun, and Gallagher 2012). Gender minorities often have higher healthcare needs, but disproportionately receive less care (Reisner et al. 2016; Winter et al. 2016; James et al. 2016) and experience bias and microaggressions while receiving care (Marcelin et al. 2019), some being refused care entirely (James et al. 2016; White Hughto et al. 2016). Online Ask The Doctor Services All of these reasons - nancial barriers, convenience, and dissatisfying interactions with medical care - are reasonspeople seek information on AtD services (Umefjord, Pe- tersson, and Hamberg 2003). In response, many commer- cial and non-commercial platforms have emerged (Vinker et al. example, CrowdMed, a US-based commercial platform, allows users to present their medical case for a fee and professional case solvers make diagnoses, and Infomedica's AtD, a Sweden-based non- commercial platform, allows users to ques- tions (Meyer, Longhurst, and Singh 2016; Umefjord, Peters- son, Hamberg 2003). However, non-commercial plat- forms often are short-lived because they are under-staffed, lack funding, and lack scalability (Ma et al. 2018). We ex- amine how patients and providers leverage free social media to create an online AtD community. Empathy in Offline and Online Health Settings Empathy - the ability to perceive and understand another person's feelings - is a crucial human interaction directly linked to health outcomes (Miller and Wallis 2011). Higher ratings of perceived empathy from a physician are associated with increased trust in the medical establishment and com- pliance with preventative care (Hojat et al. 2010). Moreover, even online empathy is associated with a greater sense of a virtual community and supportive communities are associ- ated with positive health outcomes (Welbourne, Blanchard, and Boughton 2009). Empathy often expresses itself with non-verbal cues (e.g., synchrony in voice tones or body language), but online in- teractions restrict the cues to language (Pfeil and Zaphiris 2007). Previous work on online empathy evaluated percep- tions using surveys (Nambisan 2011) or with qualitative dis- course analysis (Pfeil and Zaphiris 2007). Linguistic cues can be a simple restatement of content (indicated by nouns and verbs) or a more complex reflection of style (as indicated by pronouns and articles) (Ireland and Pennebaker 2010; Lord et al. 2015). Ireland and Pennebaker (2010) developed a method for measuring linguistic conversation synchrony (using function words) in offline settings (hereafter referred to as LSM), which was validated with measures of perceived empathy in an offline patient-medical provider setting (Lord et al. 2015). A variation of their LSM measurement has been applied in an online setting to verify linguistic accommoda- tion on Twitter (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Gamon, and Du- mais 2011). Ours is the rst study to examine cues of per- ceived empathy in an AtD service using LSM as a proxy. Data Reddit is a social media site with 330 million monthly users, primarily from the US (Alexa 2019). Individual commu- nities (subreddits) host discussions about specic subjects. r/AskDocs is a large online health community with more than 185k subscribers (January 2020). The community al- lows users to submit questions about personal medical con- ditions which are answered by physicians that are veried by community moderators and indicated by user-level tags, or \"flair,\" displayed next to username (e.g., dermatologist, physician, surgeon).

Subreddit participants comment on the poster's inquiry (hereinafter re- ferred to as commenters). We collected comments, (e.g., usernames, timestamps) from its incep- tion in July 2013 through December 2018 from pushshift.io archives. Our nal dataset (Table 1) contained 190,974 posts from 131,020 posters with 694,533 comments from 106,306 commenters. Physicians authored 12% of all comments. The number of posts has increased over time, while the percent- age of posts that supply demographics and receive a com- ment in general or specically from a physician has re- mained relatively stable. The average time to rst response decreased substantially from 2013 to 2014 and has since sta- bilized at a median of 63 minutes. At least one new physi- cian has joined and commented on r/AskDocs each month since 2014 with an average of 5 (SD = 3) new physicians commenting each month. Methods RQ1: Self-Reported Demographics in Posts Our rst research question quanties the self-reported de- mographics of posters to contextualize the users of this on- line community. While r/AskDocs asks posters to provide demographics, including sex and race, they do not require a specic format. A 21 year-old Hispanic female may describe herself as \" 21 year old Latina female \" or \" Age: 21 Sex: Fe- male Race: Hispanic .\" Rather than adhering to pre-dened racial categories (e.g., dened by the US Census Bureau), we conformed to how posters described themselves. For ex- ample, although Hispanic is an ethnicity, posters commonly used it as a race. Additionally, some posters chose to pro- vide their gender as opposed to binary sex. Similarly, we conformed to how posters described their gender. The nal gender/sex categories were female, male, transgender, or un- known, and the nal race/ethnicity categories were Asian, black, Hispanic, Indian, Middle Eastern, white, or unknown. We developed regular expressions to extract a poster's binary sex (male/female) and race/ethnicity based on how posters self-described themselves using iterative samples of 100 random posts until no new descriptions of demograph- ics appeared in the sample. If the regex identied a singular match for a demographic category, we labeled the post with the matching demographic. However, if we found multiple matches that differed within a demographic category, we la- beled the post as unknown. Additionally, we negated com- mon English patterns that are not references to race (e.g., Indian food). After applying the rules to extract binary sex,we applied rules to extract posts that self-identied as trans- gender using patterns for trans, transgender, MtF (male to female), and FtM (female to male). If a transgender pat- tern matched, we overrode the binary sex label to assign the transgender label. Performance of our rule-based approach for binary sex and race/ethnicity was measured based on a heldout sample of 100 random posts. A total of 50 posts that were labeled as transgender were reviewed for precision. RQ2: Health Topics in Posts Our second research question examines the content of posts using topics to contextualize the types of medical issues dis- cussed in the community. We applied Latent Dirichlet Al- location (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003), a probabilistic topic model that identies major topics in a text corpus by inferring topic distributions for each post and a word dis- tribution for each topic; topics are dened as distributions over words. LDA has been previously employed to iden- tify themes in health-related social media (Paul and Dredze 2014; Wang et al. 2014; De Choudhury and Resnik et al. 2015; Surian et al. 2016; Park and Conway 2017; Record et al. 2018). Text was pre-processed to lower case, remove punc- tuation, remove stop words, and replace numbers with 'num token.' We used the LDA implementation in MAL- LET (McCallum 2002) via the Gensim package ( Rehurek and Sojka 2010). Each post was assigned the highest proba- bility topic (Chen and Dredze 2018). Two authors collabora- tively labeled the topics by qualitatively reviewing the top 10 words associated with the topic and ve randomly selected posts associated with the topic. The authors' backgrounds are in digital health; author one has a background in online health information seeking and computational social science and author two has a background in public health. We re- peated this process for models with varying numbers of top- ics (50, 75, 100), and selected the model with 100 topics as it had the highest quality topics based on human judgement. We compared differences in topic prevalence across de- mographics (e.g. what do females versus males talk about) by calculating the odds of each topic in the demographic of interest to the reference group (i.e. the majority group). RQ3: Receipt of Response Our third research question measures the association be- tween self-reported demographics and the receipt of a response either in general or by a physician. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relation- ship between the explanatory variables of gender/sex and race/ethnicity in the post and the probability of (1) receiv- ing any response and (2) receiving a response from a physi- cian. While holding the other explanatory variables at their means, we estimated the probability of receiving a response (any response or a response from a physician) for each vari- able and corresponding 95% condence intervals (CIs) by using 1000 simulations from the multivariable normal distri- bution with the mean equal to the maximum likelihood point estimate and the variance equal to the coefcient covariance matrix (King, Tomz, and 2000).Category Examples Personal pronouns I, his, their Impersonal pronouns it, that, anything Articles a, an, the Conjunctions and, but, because Prepositions in, under, about Auxiliary verbs shall, be, was High-frequency adverbs very, rather, just Negations no, not, never Quantiers much, few, lots Table 2: Functional word categories for LSM as dened by LIWC 2015 (Pennebaker et al. 2015) . RQ4: Empathy of Response Our fourth research question measured the empathy of re- sponses by physicians and non-physicians. Adapting the procedure in Ireland and Pennebaker (2010), we measured the LSM of each conversation (i.e., the post and associated response(s)) as a proxy for empathy. We included all posts with at least one response that was not the original poster (follow-up comments from original posters were excluded). First, we used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (Pennebaker et al. 2015) to calculate the percentage of the total words that fall into nine function-word categories (see Table 2 for categories). Second, separate LSM scores were calculated for each of the function-word categories using Equation 1, where aux pis the percentage of auxiliary verbs used in the post and aux ris the percentage of auxiliary verbs used LSM score for each post-response pair was calculated using the mean of the nine function category- level LSM scores. Finally, if there were multiple responses, we calculated a single conversational LSM score for each post as the mean of the composite LSM scores. To calcu- late the conversational LSM for peer-to-peer interactions, we only responses the conversational LSM for patient-provider we only included responses from physicians. Con- dence intervals were calculated from bootstrapped samples. Results RQ1: Self-Reported Demographics in Posts Performance of identied race/ethnicity of the posts in the heldout sample. Sixty-six of the posts contained a gender/sex and 34 posts did not. Thirty-two of the posts contained a race/ethnicity and 67 did not. The one mislabeled post was a false negative; the poster mentioned their race, but our regex matched sev- eral other keywords so race/ethnicity was incorrectly marked as unknown. Of the 50 randomly selected posts labeled as transgender, two were incorrectly labeled. These results ex- hibit a high condence in our inferred demographic labels.

Of the posts that included self-reported gender/sex, 67.5% were authored by individuals identifying as male, 32.3% as female, and 0.3% as transgender. Of the posts that included self-reported race/ethnicity, 81% were authored by individu- als identifying as white, 7.7% as Asian, 5.2% as black, 2.7% as Hispanic, 1.7% as multiracial, 1.3% as Indian, and 0.4% as Middle Eastern. RQ2: Health Topics of Posts Figure 1 visualizes the topics with manually assigned labels. The 100 topics collapsed into 75 because of duplicate topic labels. Table 4 presents the odd ratios for the prevalence of topics from demographics of interest (minority users of r/AskDocs) compared to reference groups (majority users of r/AskDocs: whites and males). The ten most frequent medical topics included dermatol- ogy, reproductive health, diagnostic testing, dental and oral care, issues related to lower extremities, colds/sinus infec- tions/allergies, fractures/sprains, cardiology, issues related to upper extremities, and nutrition. We briefly describe some of the topics and share example posts to highlight the diver- sity of questions in this online community. The most common topic requested crowd-diagnosis (No- bles et al. 2019) of a dermatological issue. These posts were often accompanied by a photo to aid diagnosis. For example, one post requested a second opinion from r/AskDocs about a cluster of painful bumps that had been previously diagnosed as a bacterial infection and was prescribed a topical antibi- otic. An alarmed physician indicated that the poster had been misdiagnosed, diagnosed the poster with shingles (a viral, herpetic infection), and provided instructions for care. The poster followed up that they sought a second opinion in per- son and it was indeed shingles. As suggested by previous research (Umefjord, Petersson, and Hamberg 2003; Nobles et al. 2018), posters may prefer the pseudo-anonymity of the platform to discuss and request information about stigmatized health issues, such as sexu- ally transmitted infections. For example, I was treated for chlamydia with antibiotics several months ago. I started to feel similar symptoms a week ago. Is it pos- sible for it to come back? Similarly, people posted about subjects that are often con- sidered taboo or volatile in mainstream culture. Posts on substance use discussed dangers of long-term alco- hol consumption, the potential relationship between dys-Figure 1: Dot plot of the topics present in the posts. The dot indicates the number of posts that were assigned the topic. pnea (shortness of breath) and marijuana usage, risks of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) for peo- ple who have a history of epilepsy, and the symptoms of lung cancer for a long-term smoker. For example, I have a history of epilepsy, but stopped having seizures a few years ago. I want to take MDMA for the rst time. Is there a serious health risk for seizures with molly? I'm desperate to sleep so I've been taking benzos I got from a friend to help. I'm having trouble weening myself off the benzos without symptoms. I'm afraid to tell the doc for fear of being labeled a drug addict. Could this be withdrawal? Another example are posts inquiring about the efcacy and potential complications of vaccinations. For example, I had a severe reaction to the rst pertussis vaccine as a child and did not receive the rest of the series. Now with the anti- vaccination movement, I'm worried about my risk of whoop- ing cough. Has the vaccine changed in the last two decades? Posts focused on health issues, such as dental/oral care and mental health that are often compartmentalized and per- ceived as less essential (Petersen et al. 2005). For example, I have small red painful bumps around my teeth. It could be from a new toothpaste. Should I see a doctor? Posts about mental health focused not only on mental health disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, schizophrenia), but also on cognition and memory. For example, I'm in my mid-50s and noticed that I can't remember what happened in the past few weeks. I'm really scared because I'm the only provider in my house. Could this be from de- pression or stress? Should I go to the emergency department?Finally, posts also sought information about how to pro- vide care while waiting on an appointment with a physician or the necessity of medical care. For example, I broke my front tooth while I was eating [link to image]. It doesn't hurt. I'm going to see the dentist, but meanwhile is it safe to drink and eat? Should I brush the tooth? An urgent care center told me that I may have angiodema [rapid swelling that can be due to an allergic reaction]. I'm hesitant to go to the emergency department because of cost. Should I wait it out? Differences in Topics Among Gender/Sex. The odds of inquiring about female-specic health issues were 110 times higher among posts authored by females than males. Female-specic health issues exhibited concerns about birth control efcacy, painful menstruation, hormones, miscar- riages, physical signs of pregnancy, and bleeding during pregnancy. For example, one poster inquired about the best method to manage their recent pregnancy loss - whether to miscarry naturally or to have a dilation and curettage proce- dure. The odds of inquiring about female-specic health issues and hormonal issues were 44 and 18 times higher, respec- tively, among posts authored by transgender people than males. For example, one poster, assigned female at birth, ex- pressed that they had severe gender dysphoria and because of the discomfort could not bear to receive gynecological care. The poster inquired about cervical cancer and the abil- ity for a viable pregnancy if they neglected gynecological care. One poster, assigned male at birth and transitioning to female, inquired if hormone replacement therapy wouldCategory Five Largest Odds Ratios Gender/Sex Female female-specic health (110.75), chronic conditions (3.12), antibiotics (2.02), emergency care (1.92), urgency of care (1.92) Transgender female-specic health (43.95), hormone-related (17.28), side effects (5.19), medication (4.22), previous interaction with health care (3.87) Race/Ethnicity Asian acne and hair growth (1.76), allergies (1.60), school-related (1.57), nutrition (1.47), previous interaction with health care (1.42) Black environmental health (5.27), nails-related (5.02), accidents (3.20), hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding (3.15), vision (2.88) Hispanic descriptive language (expressing concern) (1.93), school-related (1.92), urgency of care (1.64), family (1.47), health insur- ance and affordability (1.47) Indian second opinion (2.64), acne and hair growth (2.15), side effects (2.00), supplements (1.97), diagnostic testing (1.79) Middle Eastern family (5.40), chest (3.83), health insurance and affordability (3.78), school-related (2.84), supplements (2.58) Multiracial substance use (ingested) (5.26), side effects (4.55), environmental health (4.50), hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding (3.85), substance use (inhaled) (3.12) Table 4: The ve largest odds ratios for the prevalence of topics from minority users of r/AskDocs compared to reference groups (white and male). Odds ratios greater than 1 indicate that the topic is more likely to occur in the posts of minority users. achieve desired facial attributes. Another poster, assigned female at birth and transitioning to male, had elevated lab results indicative of a blood cancer and inquired about the safety of starting testosterone. A physician responded that despite the blood work, the symptoms seemed indicative of a more benign condition. Differences in Topics Among Race/Ethnicity There were fewer differences in race/ethnicity compared to dif- ferences by gender/sex. While a few high odds ratios stand out, we caution in interpretation because the number of posts grouped by racial/ethnic category and topic is substantially smaller than the number of posts grouped by gender/sex cat- egory and topic. The odds of inquiring about environmen- tal health were ve times higher among posts authored by people identifying as black than white. Posts mentioning a family-related issue were ve times more likely by peo- ple identifying as Middle Eastern than white. Substance use posts were ve times more likely by people identifying as multiracial than white. RQ3: Receipt of Response Table 5 shows the probability of receiving a response associ- ated with each demographic and 95% condence intervals. In the logistic regression models estimating the association between demographics and receiving a response, there was no evidence that self-reported gender/sex or race/ethnicity were associated with a practically signicant difference in the probability of receiving any response or receiving a re- sponse from a physician. Receipt of Any Response Across the entire sample, the probability of receiving a response was 71.6%. Males had a slightly lower probability of receiving a response than fe- males and posts where gender/sex were unknown. Posts au- thored by transgender people had a similar probability of receiving a response as females, males, and unknown gen- der/sex. Posts authored by people identifying as white had a slightly lower probability of receiving a response than posts authored by people who identied black, multiracial, or posts where race/ethnicity were unknown. Overall, we found that poster demographics had little to no effect in re- ceiving a response.Receipt of Response from a Physician Across the entire sample, the probability of receiving a response was 11.2%. A null association of self-reporting gender/sex and prob- ability of receiving a response from a physician was ob- served for posts authored by females, males, transgender people, and unknown gender/sex. A null association of self- reporting race/ethnicity and probability of receiving a re- sponse from a physician was observed for posts authored by people who identify as Asian, black, Hispanic, Indian, Mid- dle Eastern, multiracial, white, and unknown race/ethnicity. RQ4: Empathy of Response(s) Empathy across Demographics Table 5 presents the LSM and differences in LSM between physician and non- physician responses across demographics. Posts that self- identify as female are associated with slightly more em- pathetic responses than males. Posts that self-identify as Asian, black, Hispanic, Indian, or Middle Eastern are associ- ated with slightly less empathetic responses than their white counterparts. To better understand these computational differences in empathy, we qualitatively reviewed a random sample of 20 posts identifying as female and 20 posts identifying as male inquiring about dermatology (the most common topic in this community). The posts contained similar types of inquiries (e.g., questions about skin irritation, insect bites), had sim- ilar lengths (mean 161.9 \u000665.0 words female-authored posts and mean 161.4 \u0006157.6 words for male-authored posts), and received a similar number of comments (mean 1.7\u00061.2 for female-authored posts and mean 1.1 \u00060.7 for male-authored posts). Despite similarities, the comments for male-authored posts often focused on brief diagnoses con- trasted to comments to female-authored posts which often focused on providing contextual information, resources, and suggested treatments in addition to diagnosing. We share conversations below that exemplify this. Post (male author): I've had a red rash on my face for several years (see image). The only med I take is [medication name] for a mood disorder.

Positive values indicate physician responses are more empathetic; negative values that non-physician responses are more empathetic.

I also used to smoke. What is this? Comment: That looks like seborrheic eczema. It's a very common condition, I even have it myself. I suggest trying an over-the-counter anti-fungal cream and hydrocortisone. Physician responses were slightly less empathetic than re- sponses by non-physicians for posts that self-identied their race/ethnicity as Asian, black, white or unknown, and their gender/sex as female, male, or unknown. Empathy across Topics The LSM across topics varied more than across demographics ranging from 50.1% (der- matology) to 62.4% (emergency care). Topics with the most empathetic responses were emergencies (62.4, 95% CI [61.4, 63.4], general mental health (62.4, 95% related to cognition (61.6, 95% CI [60.6, 62.5]). Topics with were dermatology (50.1, 95% CI [49.7, 50.6]), discussions with a lot of descriptive language about their history (52.1, 95% CI [51.6, 52.5], and nails (53.1, 95% CI [51.2, 54.0]). We qualitatively reviewed a random sample of 10 posts inquiring about dermatology (the topic with the least em- pathetic responses) and 10 posts inquiring about emergency care (the topic with the most empathetic responses) authored by white males (the most common demographic in this com- munity). The posts inquiring about emergency care were longer (mean 501 \u0006303 words compared to mean 178 \u0006 131 words for dermatology inquiries), received more com- ments (mean 2.3 \u00062 compared to mean 1.5 \u00061.0 for derma- tology inquiries), and received longer comments (mean 97 \u0006112 words compared to mean 42 \u000664 words for derma- tology inquiries). Emergency care inquiries focused on the immediacy of receiving care for a number of issues includ- ing chest pain, infections, fevers, car accidents, falls, and complications with existing medical issues, whereas der- matology inquiries mostly focused on the issues previously described. In contrast to the dermatology inquiries, emer- gency care inquiries often received responses prompting theposter to supply additional contextual information and used hedges (e.g., \" sounds like \") to avoid bold statements (Re- casens, Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, and Jurafsky 2013). We share an emergency care conversation below that exempli- es this. Post: I need urgent advice! I have heart palpitations that I thought were panic attacks. Yesterday I went to the ER, where they did several diagnostic tests. I was cleared. It's worse to- day. The nurse line tole me to seek care, but I don't have the money for another ER visit. Am I having a heart attack? Could it be something else? Comment: I'm not a doc, but I have [medical condition]. It sounds like you may have a serious heart condition. Diagnos- tic tests that you mentioned can be normal even when there is a problem. I suggest you go to the ER for a wearable device that will track it for longer. Try not to worry. I manage my condition using [medication name]. Keep us updated! Responses by physicians were either similar in empathy or less empathetic (e.g., the greatest difference were discus- sions related to nails than responses from non-physicians across topics. We qualitatively reviewed a random sample of 20 posts inquiring about nail-related issues (the topic with the largest difference in empathy between physicians and non- physicians) that had comments from both a physician and non-physician. Inquiries about nails focused on injuries, dis- coloration, ingrown nails, and fungal infections. Not surpris- ingly, posts received more comments from non-physicians (mean 1.6 \u00060.6) than physicians (mean 1.2 \u00060.4). Com- ments from non-physicians were longer (mean 43 \u000641 words compared to mean 34 \u000634 words for physicians). Re- sponses from non-physicians with higher scores of empathy tended to use more pronouns to empathize of share a per- sonal experience (e.g., \" I understand how you feel ,\" \"I know someone who was diagnosed with that \"), whereas responses from physicians with lower scores of empathy tended to fo- cus on supplying direct, factual information (e.g., \" Unless the nail is removed, it will stay like this \"). We share a con-versation below that exemplies this. Post: I injured my nail several years ago (see image). My primary care doctor said that it would grow back with time and it hasn't. Will it? Physician Comment: It won't grow back unless you have surgery to remove it, but sometimes the surgery makes it worse. Non-Physician Comment: I also injured my nail and I think it grew back immediately after the incident, but now I also have a a white spot underneath that nail. Discussion Using self-reported demographics and discovered health topics on a social media platform with AtD services, we identied that this online community was primarily male and white, users most commonly sought help for low acu- ity conditions like dermatology, and females and trans- gender people sought help on sensitive topics at a higher rate than their male counterparts. There were also small differences in how empathetic a response was across de- mographics, where females received more empathetic re- sponses than males and racial/ethnic minorities received less empathetic responses than their white counterparts. In gen- eral, physicians responses were also less empathetic than non-physicians across demographics and topics. Contextualizing the Findings Online Ask the Doctor Services To our knowledge, this is the rst study examining how patients and providers have leveraged publicly available social media to establish an or- ganic AtD service. Most AtD services are either facilitated by health agencies (Deldar, Marouzi, and As- sadi 2011b; Vinker et al. 2007) or for-prot companies (Ma et al. 2018). The barriers to participation (as either a poster, peer responder, or physician responder) in this community are low in comparison to other AtD services. For example, all posts and responses can be read without an account; ac- counts to participate are free; and physicians can verify their status by providing identication to the moderators. Since most information seeking is limited to passively viewing websites (Zhang 2014), the audience of this Reddit commu- nity is likely larger than the active users of the platform. Known motivations for using commercial AtD platforms are supported by this community (Ma et al. 2018). For exam- ple, people seek information to weigh if they should receive clinical care, are preparing for a clinical visit, are looking for a second opinion, need help deciphering medical diag- nostic results or instructions following a clinical visit, and need help navigating their health insurance or health care system. Unlike commercial AtD platforms, criteria to verify the credentials of the participating physicians is less stringent and not continuously veried. As of January 2020, the sub- reddit accepts a \" medical ID, diploma, or other forms of verication \" as valid for verication. Additionally, physi- cians are allowed to self-describe their expertise for their flair therefore there is no consistency on how a physician de- scribes themselves (e.g., a dermatologist may opt to identify as a physician or a dermatologist).Bias & Barriers in Health Care Users inquire about nu- merous health issues, including issues that are often com- partmentalized and perceived as less vital when nancially constrained (e.g., dental health, mental health) (Petersen et al. 2005), or stigmatized (e.g., mental health, substance use, reproductive health, sexual health). Previous research has shown that stigmatized issues can generate discomfort and lead to help-seeking outside of the traditional health care set- ting (Corrigan 2004; Magee et al. 2014; Flanders et al. 2017; Aicken et al. 2016). Conversing with peers and physicians in a pseudo-anonymous setting may help the poster better understand how seemingly compart- mentalized issues contribute to a holistic impact on health as well as normalize stigmatized health issues (Nobles et al. 2019). Consistent with the demographics of Reddit in general, most posters identify as male and white (Perrin and An- derson 2019). However, gender and racial/ethnic minori- ties participate in this community, albeit at lower rates than their majority counterparts. Some of the health issues that receive differential care in the offline setting are inquired about in this community at higher rates for females and transgender people than their male counterparts. We found that females and transgender people have higher odds of inquiring about sensitive or stigmatized topics than their male counterparts. For example, females and transgender people both discuss female-specic health concerns includ- ing pregnancy, pregnancy loss, and menstruation at higher rates. All of these are taboo topics in mainstream culture, and, most recently, there has been a push for technology that helps people connect over these topics (Andalibi and Forte 2018). Females also discuss chronic issues, such as - bromyalgia, at higher rates than males. In the offline setting, patient-provider conversations about chronic issues, includ- ing pain, are strained (Frantsve and Kerns 2007) and these conversations are more tense for females (Juni et al. 2010; Homan 2019). Transgender people have higher odds of in- quiring about hormonal issues, side effects, medication, and health care interactions than males. Inquiries are often in the context of navigating a transition and, as previous research has shown, people often have difculty obtaining care dur- ing this period (James et al. 2016). Peer-to-Peer & Patient-Provider Interactions While we did not nd variance of response rates across demograph- ics, we found that response empathy does vary across de- mographics and topics, which supports previous work that found differences in other online communities and informa- tion seeking contexts (Joiner et al. 2014; Wang and Jurgens 2018). We also found that responses from physicians are less empathetic than responses from non-physicians. Empathetic communication, especially with medical pro- fessionals, is critical for coping with a health issue and obtaining a positive outcome (Ha and Longnecker 2010). Training for empathetic communication in face-to-face interactions has become standard in medical education (Shapiro, Morrison, and Boker 2004). As patient-provider communication shifts towards computer mediated interac- tions (Weiner 2012) there will be an increased focus on em-pathetic linguistic cues (Pfeil and Zaphiris 2007). Implications Supporting Patient-Provider Interactions on Social Me- dia This study has implications for enhancements that may facilitate and support interactions on AtD platforms, as well as other online health communities. First, the number of physicians participating in this com- munity is low in comparison to the number of posters. Physi- cians' use of online tools to communicate with patients is low, in part because physicians' experiences and attitudes towards information technology vary (Antoun 2015). Some do not believe their patients want or can communicate ef- fectively online; others do not feel condent they can ef- fectively use these platforms or perceive it as an additional burden (Antheunis, Tates, and Nieboer 2013b). However, as Thompson, Younes, and Miller (2012) noted, social media is the new vehicle for patient engagement in medicine - \"our patients are doing it [using social media], so this is where we need to be.\" There are a number of ways that physi- cian participation could be encouraged. For example, physi- cians must undertake continuing medical education (CME) and could receive CMEs by participating in online health communities. Similarly, medical trainees could use online communications as training for one-to-one communications with patients. Previous work found that physicians that par- ticipated in AtD services saw growth in their personal devel- opment, such as being better able to understand the patient's perspective, develop strategies to best answer patients' con- cerns, communicate empathetically, or explain medical ter- minology in lay terms (Bj \u00a8ork et al. 2017b). Second, beyond interpersonal interactions, information sharing and exchange that 'flows' is an important factor for a user to have a positive online experience (Nambisan 2011). Thoughtful tools, designed hand-in-hand with user experi- ence experts, may improve our abilities to effectively search, locate, and extract information in online health communi- ties. For example, auto-complete suggestions could be in- corporated into the search function to allow people to use common terminology so their posts can be more easily lo- cated by peers/experts as well as allow them to better for- mulate their queries. By adding these types of features these communities may begin to serve as a knowledge repository and even allow public health experts to engage in resource sharing (Nambisan 2011). Limitations and Future Work Some limitations of this study suggest promising areas for future work. First, we did not distinguish between female- to-male or male-to-female transitions or examine the role of intersectionality. While certainly important (Kelly 2009), we could not make these assessments because of the small sample size once a post was grouped by race/ethnicity, gen- der/sex, and health topic. Second, we cannot infer physi- cians' or peers' motivations for volunteering to participate on the platform without complementary offline informa- tion. Related, we cannot assess the underlying motivations of posters who use the platform to seek health informationor provide (versus not provide) self-described demograph- ics when doing so. Collectively, these limitations point to the utility of future participatory human-centered research strategies, such as interviews, that can elucidate the vary- ing motivations of stakeholders using this platform (Baumer 2017; Chancellor, Baumer, and De Choudhury 2019). A bet- ter understanding of this could help design a better platform for health-based interactions. Fourth, we analyzed interac- tions using two measures: response rates and empathy. We sought to observe whether differential response rates were associated with demographics and found no practical dif- ferences. We did not consider other potential factors that may explain a differential response rate including the health topic, timing of the post (note that pushshift.io normalizes timestamps to UTC so this is not possible), or voting as a proxy for rendering of the display for posts (note that pushshift.io does not archive comments contextualized with the voting score at the time of the comment). Other mea- sures could examine the quality of the response including computational approaches, such as linguistic approaches to examine potential biases of the language, and participatory approaches, such as whether a user perceives the responses as helpful or trustworthy. Finally, although we are encour- aged that we do not immediately see very large biases in response rates or empathy across demographics, differences could exist in ways we were unable to detect. Future com- putational and qualitative discourse analyses could focus on examining if other linguistic cues may indicate if potential bias is present in the responses.
