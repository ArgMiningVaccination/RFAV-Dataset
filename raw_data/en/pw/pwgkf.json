HEALTH EFFECTS 3.1 INTRODUCTION The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide public health officials, physicians, toxicologists, and other interested individuals and gr oups with an overall perspective of the toxicology of benzidine. It contains descriptions and evaluations of toxicologi cal studies and epidemiological investigations and provides conclusions, where possible, on the relevance of toxicity and toxicokinetic data to public health. A glossary and list of acronyms, abbreviations, and symbols can be found at the end of this profile. The toxicity and toxicokinetic information presente d in this chapter focuses on studies that involved benzidine, either in its free base or dihydrochlor ide forms (all doses are expressed in terms of the free base). Data from various benzidine derivatives (including benzidine-based dyes) are occasionally mentioned for comparative purposes, or because such chemicals may serve as potential sources of benzidine exposure. 3.2 DISCUSSION OF HEALTH EFFECTS BY ROUTE OF EXPOSURE To help public health professionals and others a ddress the needs of persons living or working near hazardous waste sites, the information in this section is organized first by route of exposure (inhalation, oral, and dermal) and then by health effect (d eath, systemic, immunological, neurological, reproductive, developmental, genotoxic, and carcinogenic effects). These data are discussed in terms of three exposure periods: acute (14 days or less), intermediate (15-364 days), and chronic (365 days or more). Levels of significant exposure for each route and duration are presented in tables and illustrated in figures. The points in the figures showing no- observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) or lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels (LOAELs) reflect the actual doses (levels of exposure) used in the studies. LOAELS have been classified into \"less serious\" or \"serious\" effects. \"Serious\" effects are those that evoke failure in a biological system and can lead to morbidity or mortality (e.g., acute respiratory distress or death). \"Less serious\" effects are those that are not expected to cause significant dysfunction or death, or those whose significance to the organi sm is not entirely clear. ATSDR acknowledges that a considerable amount of judgment may be require d in establishing whether an end point should be classified as a NOAEL, \"less serious\" LOAEL, or \"serious\" LOAEL, and that in some cases, there will be 16 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS insufficient data to decide whether the effect is indicative of significant dysfunction. However, the Agency has established guidelines and policies that are used to classify these end points. ATSDR believes that there is sufficient merit in this appr oach to warrant an attempt at distinguishing between \"less serious\" and \"serious\" effects. The distinction between \"less serious\" effects and \"serious\" effects is considered to be important because it helps the users of the profiles to identify levels of exposure at which major health effects start to appear. LOAELs or NOAELs should also help in determining whether or not the effects vary with dose and/or duration, and pl ace into perspective the po ssible significance of these effects to human health. The significance of the exposure levels shown in the Levels of Significant Exposure (LSE) tables and figures may differ depending on the user's perspective. Public health officials and others concerned with appropriate actions to take at hazardous waste s ites may want information on levels of exposure associated with more subtle effects in humans or animals (LOAELs) or exposure levels below which no adverse effects (NOAELs) have been observed. Es timates of levels posing minimal risk to humans (Minimal Risk Levels or MRLs) may be of inte rest to health professionals and citizens alike. Levels of exposure associated with carcinogenic effects (Cancer Effect Levels, CELs) of benzidine are indicated in Tables 3-1 and 3-2 and Figures 3-1 and 3-2. Because cancer effects could occur at lower exposure levels, Figures 3-1 and 3- 2 also show a range for the upper bound of estimated excess risks, ranging from a risk of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 10,000,000 (10 -4 to 10-7), as developed by EPA. A User's Guide has been provided at the end of this profile (see Appendix B). This guide should aid in the interpretation of the tables and figures for Levels of Significant Exposure and the MRLs. 3.2.1 Inhalation Exposure Benzidine is a solid with a low vapor pressure (see Table 4-1) at normal ambient temperatures; therefore, inhalation of the vapor would not commonly be expected in the general environment. However, in the past, many occupational exposures involved inhalation of airborne dust or vapors from benzidine. Although exposure by the dermal route may also have been significant, most epidemiological studies will be discussed in the Inhalation Exposure section rather than in the Dermal Exposure section. 17 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.2.1.1 Death No studies were located regarding death in humans or animals after acute- or intermediate-duration inhalation exposure to benzidine. Death from cancer following chronic-duration occupational exposure of workers is discussed in Section 3.2.1.8. Of 48 rats exposed to benzidine dust in air (10-20 mg/m3), 20 died within 13 months (Zabezhinskii 1970). However, the significance of this is unclear because neither survival in the control population nor information on the causes of death was reported. 3.2.1.2 Systemic Effects No studies were located regarding respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, musculoskeletal, hepatic, renal, dermal, or ocular e after inhalation exposure to benzidine. 3.2.1.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects Total natural killer cell activity against target cells from a human cancer cell line was found to be normal in 63 Japanese workers occupationally exposed to benzidine and -naphthylamine when compared to unexposed workers from the same fact ory (Tanigawa et al. 1990). However, the number of circulating natural killer cells actually mediating cytotoxic ac tivity was increased in exposed workers relative to controls, indicating a decrease in cytotoxic activity pe r natural killer cell. Mechanisms to explain this apparent effect of benzidine (and/or -naphthylamine) on natural killer cell activity, and particularly its persistence for nearly 20 years, are currently unknown. It is important to note that these data do not prove that benzidine exposure actually impairs immune sy stem function since the observed differences between exposed workers and controls may have been specific to -naphthylamine and not benzidine. Furthermore, no attempt was made to statistica lly account for smoking, although there was a similar number of smokers in both groups. In another study, the blood of 27 high-exposure and 25 low-exposure male dye workers who had been exposed to -naphthylamine and benzidine prior to 1972 was analyzed for T lymphocyte subpopulations, Leu11a-(CD-16) positive lymphocytes, and total lymphocytes (Araki et al. 1993). These values were compared to a control group of 33 workers at the same plant that 18 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS had no known exposure to aromatic amines. The total and relative numbe rs of CD4+ and CD3+ lymphocytes in the high-exposure group were significantly lower than those in the control group, but there were no significant differences regarding CD 8+, CD16+, and total num ber and percentage of lymphocytes. There were no significant differen ces between the 25 low-exposure workers and the 33 subjects in the control group with respect to th e parameters examined. Some people in the group examined by Araki et al. (1993) may have been also subjects in the Tanigawa et al. (1990) study; therefore, the observations may not be independent . Sung et al. (1995) and Tanigawa et al. (1996) reported on male dye workers also exposed before 1972. High-exposure workers exhibited a reduction in the relative number of total CD4+ T lymphocytes and c oncurrent reductions in the absolute and relative numbers of subpopulation CD4+CD 45RA+ (suppressor-inducer) T lymphocytes; the authors suggested that this T lymphocyte subpopulation may be the majo r target of effects related to aromatic amine exposure (Sung et al. 1995). Tanigawa et al. (1996) found significantly increased numbers of natural killer cell subpopulation CD57+CD16- in high-exposure workers, and indicated that this increase might be compensation for observed decreases in the number of CD4+ lymphocytes. It is important to note that none of the study subjects exhibited signs of infection at the time of the study; the authors also stated that the subjects were not taking any drugs (at the time of the study) which might have affected immunological analysis (Sung et al. 1995; Tanigawa et al. 1996). No studies were located regarding immunological effects in animals after inhalation exposure to benzidine. No studies were located regarding the following effect s in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to benzidine: 3.2.1.4 Neurological Effects 3.2.1.5 Reproductive Effects 3.2.1.6 Developmental Effects 3.2.1.7 Cancer A number of epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed workers have demonstrated that benzidine exposure is associated with an elevated ri sk of developing urinary bladder cancer (Bulbulyan et al. 1995; Goldwater et al. Meigs et al. 1973). Bo th inhalation and dermal routes of exposure are 19 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS likely involved in most of these studies; therefore, none of the available data are adequate to permit the establishment of accurate inhalation dose-response re lationships. The power of these studies to find an association between exposure to benzidine and increased incidence of bladder cancer varies greatly from study to study, largely due to the different sample sizes and to the difficulty of determining the extent to which workers were exposed to benzidine and/or other carcinogens. Acknowledging that while some studies may have evaluated a less than optimal number of individuals, the number of studies that found a positive association between bladder cancer and exposur e to benzidine leave little uncertainty regarding the true nature of such an association. Most st udies located were cohort studies, but a few case control studies were also available. In general, it is likely that the level of exposure in the case control studies is, on average, much lower that in the cohort studies, which tend to focus on workers with highest benzidine exposures. It should also be mentioned that in case control studies, information is collected on past events which may be inaccurately recorded or not av ailable, and information supplied by an informant may be consciously or unconsciously biased. T hus, because of over exposures and the potential for misclassification, case control studies are less useful than cohort studies in making causal statements. Among 83 Italian dye-stuff workers exposed to benzidine between 1931 and 1960, 20 were diagnosed with bladder tumors (Vigliani and Barsotti 1962). Measured airborne concentrations of benzidine ranged from 0 to 2.0 \u00b5g/m 3 (mean=0.3 \u00b5g/m3), and urinary concentrations ra nged from 6 to 26 \u00b5g/L. Similar findings were reported for a coal tar dye factory, where 17 of 76 workers exposed to benzidine between 1912 and 1962 developed bladder cancer (Goldwater et al. 1965). An English case control study of 1,030 bladder patients showed an elevated risk for developing bladder cancer among textile and dye workers with the potential for benzidine exposure (Anthony and Thomas 1970). Working in the textile industry or as a dye worker was associated with 2-fold and 7-fold increases in bladder cancer risk, respectively. Two control groups were used in this study, patients with cancer at other sites and surgical patients who did not have cancer. Among 105 male wo rkers at a Connecticut benzidine manufacturing facility who were estimated to have 2 or more years of exposure, 6 bladder tumors were observed (standardized incidence ratio=1,303) when only 0.46 we re expected (Meigs et al. 1986). No significant increases were found for other anatomical sites. In a case report described by Tsuchiya et al. (1975), there were 65 workers who developed bladder tumo rs among an estimated 542 workers (11.3%) involved in the production of benzidine, compared to 11 of 761 (1.4%) involved with its use. A cohort of 25 males occupationally exposed to benzidine during its manufacture was followed for 13 years (Zavon et al. 1973). Although the common chem ical to which all were exposed was benzidine, exposure to other suspect chemicals could not be en tirely discounted. Airborne benzidine concentrations 20 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS at various locations within the plant varied from <0.005 to a maximum of 17.6 mg/m3 at a location where the workers shoveled benzidine into drums; the approximate mean urinary concentration reached 0.04 \u00b5g/L by the end of the workshift. Thirteen men (52%) developed trans itional cell bladder carcinoma after a mean exposure of 13.6 years and an average la tency (time from first exposure) of 16.6 years. The mean duration of exposure for those who did not deve lop tumors was 8.9 years. No cases of tumors were observed in any man who spent less than six years in the production of benzidine. Four renal tumors were also observed. Of four men who had died, only one died as a result of urinary tract malignancy, and he had refused all therapy after the initial treatment. The other three died from causes unrelated to urinary tract pathology. Zavon et al. (1973) stated that (at the time of the study) the mean survival time for all 13 tumor patients was 10 years, and 9.7 years for the 11 patients with conditions diagnosed as cancer. Although dermal exposure was also likely, it appears that inhalation was the major route of exposure. Age at first exposure to benzidine has been correlate d with bladder cancer risk in several epidemiological studies. Shinka et al. (1991) observed that 105 of 874 Japanese workers who were engaged in the manufacture and handling of benzidine (but not -naphthylamine) develope d urothelial (primarily bladder) tumors. The approximate mean latency period was 24 years (consistent with peak tumor incidence occurring 25 years after peak benzidine produc tion), and varied inversely with the worker's age at first exposure. In a more recent study of 363 dye workers, Shinka et al. (1995) found urothelial tumors in 58 of the workers. The risk factors significantly related to tumor occurrence were benzidine as a dye intermediate (odds ratio [OR], 8.302, P<0.05), manuf acturing work exposure (OR, 1.018, P<0.05). Relative risk of bladde r cancer mortality in a cohort of 664 Italian workers exposed to various aromatic amines, including benzidine, was also found to vary inversely both with age at first exposure and time since last exposure (Piolatto et al. 1991). In a retrospective cohort study of 1,972 Chinese workers exposed to benzidine between 1972 and 1977, the standardized incidence and mortality ratios for bladder cancer were 25 and 17.5, respectively (Bi et al. 1992). Further, bladder cancer was positively correlate d with both estimated exposure level and exposure duration. The authors noted that occupational risk of benzidine-associated bladder cancer appeared to be comparable for Chinese and western workers, despite a significantly lower prevalence in Chinese workers of the slow-acetylator phenotype associated with increased bladder cancer risk (see Sections 3.5.2 and 3.10). An industrial hygiene study identified benzidine and/ or its metabolite N-acetylbenzidine in the urine of 8 of 38 workers exposed to benzidine-based dyes (NIO SH 1980c). Several of these workers were in the 21 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS textile dyeing industry rather than in dye manufacture, and thus were primarily exposed to the dyes, not free benzidine (contaminant levels of benzidine in the dyes were <1-20 ppm). This suggests that individuals may be indirectly exposed to benz idine via the reduction of benzidine-based dyes to benzidine, and that occupational exposure to such dyes may present an excess risk for cancer of the bladder or other sites. Somewhat elevated relative risks for bladder cancer have been noted in textile dyers (Anthony and Thomas 1970). However, no sim ilar excess risk for workers in the Chinese textile printing and dyeing industry was found, despite a de monstrated occupational link between benzidine or benzidine-based dye manufacture and worker bladder cancer (Xue-Yun et al. 1990). One possible explanation for this latter result is that there was little actual exposure to the benzidine-based dyes (or to contaminating benzidine); however, no exposure data were reported. The data of Xue-Yun et al. (1990) also provide support that there is no relationship between exposure to benzidine-based dyes and increased bladder cancer risk. Benzidine-exposed workers who also smoked cigarettes were reported to have nearly a 31-fold higher risk of developing bladder cancer compared to an 11-fold risk of developing bladder cancer among nonsmoking coworkers (Bi et al. 1992). This synergistic effect of smoking on benzidine-associated bladder cancer risk was also observed in a retros pective cohort study of 2,525 Chinese workers exposed to benzidine for at least 1 year (Wu 1988). When compared with nonsmoking controls (nonexposed), the relative risk for bladder cancer of smoking controls was 6.2, compared to a risk of 63.4 for nonsmoking exposed workers, and a risk of 152.3 for smoking exposed workers. The potential role of increased benzidine ingestion due to the increased hand- to-mouth activity associated with smoking was not addressed. For all males exposed to benzidine, the standardized incidence ratio was calculated at 2,610, in remarkably close agreement with the standardized incidence ratio of 2,500 from the previously discussed findings of Bi et al. (1992). Although there have been some studies to the contrary (Meigs et al. 1986; Naito et al. 1995), there is some evidence suggesting that exposure to benzidine may elevate the risk of developing cancer at sites other than the bladder. However, the evidence suppor ting such an association is much weaker than that for bladder cancer. Contributing to the weakness of the evidence is the fact that the number of cases is usually small, such that the biological significance of any statistical analysis is questionable and also, there seems to be little consistency in the findings re garding tumor sites. Based on what is known about the mechanism of carcinogenicity of benzidine (see S ections 3.4.3 and 3.5.2), findings of carcinogenicity in the liver and kidney, as some studies have reported, are not totally unexpected. 22 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS In the previously mentioned study by Wu (1988), in addition to the principal findings related to bladder cancer, a slight increase in the incidence of lung and stomach cancers was noted in workers exposed to benzidine, but quantitative data were not provided. In a study of 639 white males in Ohio exposed to benzidine and/or -naphthylamine during 1938 and 1939 and fo llowed until 1965, Mancusco and El-Attar (1967) reported not only excess bladder cancer, but also six cases of pancreatic cancer. The calculated mortality rates per 100,000 due to pancreatic cancer were 39 for the exposed workers and 7.5 for the general white male population of Ohio. Though of questionable significance, one case of kidney cancer was also observed. A large cohort of 3,322 Japanese workers exposed to benzidine and/or -naphthylamine between 1950 and 1978 was studied by Morinaga et al. (1982). The observed period of the study cohort ranged from 0.1 to 22 years (mean=8.2 years) and that of a c ontrol cohort from 0.3 to 13.5 years (mean=5.3 years). The control cohort consisted of 177 male unexposed patients with bladder cancer. Among employees exposed to benzidine and/or -naphthylamine, 244 workers were found to have suffered from and consequently died of cancer of the genitourinary organs (first primary cancer). Of these, 11 (4.5%) developed second primary cancers of the liver, gallbladder, bile duct, large intestine, or lung. For the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct cases, the differen ce between the study cohort and control group was statistically significant (p<0.05). The first prim ary cancers in these 11 cases were all transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary tract. The second primar y cancers were all adenocarcinomas except for a cancer of the maxillary sinus. Similar findings were reported in another Japanese study comparing 117 bladder cancer patients exposed to benzidine and/or -naphthylamine with 117 nonexposed control bladder cancer patients (Okubo et al. 1985). Multiple primary cancers were observed in eight of the exposed bladder cancer cases compared to only one of the control cases (three adenocarcinomas of the colon and/or rectum, three adenocarcinomas of the lung, one adenocarcinoma of biliary tract, and one hepatoma). Interestingly, the study also showed that benzidine-exposed workers developing bladder cancer had shorter survival times than persons wit hout benzidine exposure who developed bladder cancer. This could indicate either that there are more mu ltiple primaries in benzidine workers (bladder cancer among benzidine workers is more deadly), or that benzidine workers are diagnosed later with bladder cancer, which is unlikely given that they are under surveillance. A case of kidney, bladder, and liver cancer was recently reported in a Japanese dye worker at autopsy (Morikawa et al. 1997). Analyses of the tumors led to a diagnosis of triple primary tumo rs. The worker had been exposed by inhalation for eighteen years to benzidine, but not to -naphthylamine or other carcinogens. 23 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS A cohort of workers exposed to azodye-related com pounds, including benzidine, was examined as part of a larger retrospective study of 2,642 workers employed at a New Jersey dye and resin manufacturing plant from 1952 to 1985 (Delzell et al. 1989). The mortality experience of the workers was related to former employment at the Cincinnati Chemical Wo rks, which had produced or used benzidine and -naphthylamine. The 2,553 workers who had never worked at the Cincinnati Chemical Works and therefore, had little potential for benzidine exposure, had fewer than expected deaths from all causes combined and equal numbers of observed and expected cancer deaths. The 89 former Cincinnati Chemical Works workers had an excess of cancer (17/8.6, P=0.02), which was due to excess mortality from bladder (3/0.25, P=0.004), kidney (2/0.21, P=0. 04), and central nervous system (2/0.22, P= 0.04) cancers. Further evidence suggesting the potential for additional target organ sites for benzidine carcinogenicity was found in the previously discussed study of 664 Italian dyestuff workers (Piolatto et al. 1991). In that study, elevated ratios of observe d-to-expected deaths were noted for cancer of the bladder (49/1.6), oral cavity (6/2.2), esophagus (4/1.7), and larynx (9/2.4). The mortality of a cohort of 1,244 workers (870 men, 374 women), exposed to benzidine-based azo dyes (as well as other chemicals used in the tanning process) during employment at an Italian chrome tannery between 1955 and 1988, was studied until 1994 (Montanar o et al. 1997). While all-cause mortality was similar to that of the general population, morta lity for all cancers was 12% higher than expected. Observed (10) versus expected (4.13) deaths due to bladder cancer yielded a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 242. An excess of colorectal cancers was also reported (17 observed, 9.4 expected, SMR=180). An earlier study by Siemiatycki et al. (1994) found no excess bladder or other cancer risk among leather workers; it should be noted, however, that the aut hors did not assess exposure to specific amines, but only to aromatic amines as a class. Cancer incidence and mortality were evaluate d among aniline dye workers employed in a Moscow facility as of January 1975, and followed until Decembe r 1989 (Bulbulyan et al. 1995). In a group of men (514) and women (287) who had ever been exposed to benzidine or -naphthylamine during a combined total of 9,048 person-years of employment, there were 115 observed cases of all cancers versus 62.57 expected cases. The ratios of observed/ expected cases of bladder cancer were 19/1.76 (standardized incidence ratio 1,082) in men and 5/0. 24 (standardized incidence ratio 2,097) in women. The risk for bladder cancer did not increase with dur ation of employment for workers ever exposed to benzidine, but it did for workers ever exposed to -naphthylamine. Excess risks were found in men for esophageal and lung cancer. Excess cancer rates, incl uding bladder cancer, were also found in groups of employees considered to have been exposed only to \"other\" chemicals. 24 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS In a case control study, Wilkins and Sinks (1990) analyzed parental occupational histories for 110 cases of childhood malignant neoplasm of the brain, and fo r 193 matched controls. A cluster methodology was used to group jobs with similar exposures to certain ch emicals. In jobs categorized as having moderate to high exposure to aromatic amines, paternal employment during preconception, prenatal, or postnatal periods was associated with the following elevated odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals): 2.4 (0.7-7.8), 1.8 (0.5-6.2), and 2.7 (1.1-6.8), respectively. When paternal exposure to benzidine during the postnatal period was inferred to be from moderate to high, there was an associated elevated odds ratio of 4.3 (1.3-13.8). In both the prenatal and prec onception periods, the frequency of moderate-to-heavy occupational exposure among fathers was low and no odds ratios were calculated for benzidine. Few maternal exposure associations were identified, proba bly due to the small number of employed mothers in the study. The value of this study is weakened by ill-defined exposure routes (inhalation is presumed to be the primary route for benzidine exposure), as we ll as the lack of sufficient validation of the job exposure matrix used in estimating exposure levels. The results and conclusions of this study are largely speculative, and considerably more evidence will be required to draw any conclusions with confidence. Two studies that did not find significant increased in cidences of cancers other than bladder cancer are Meigs et al. (1986) and Naito et al. (1995). In a study of workers at a Connecticut benzidine manufacturing facility, Meigs et al. (1986) did not find significantly elevated risks for cancers at sites other than the bladder in men or at any anatomic site in women, and no pattern of increasing risk with increasing benzidine exposure for sites other than the bladder. The authors did find, however, nonstatistically significant increases in the incidence of prostate cancer, stomach cancer, and lung cancer; in the latter case, 8 of 11subjects had a history of heavy smoking, and no information was available for the other three. In the Naito et al. (1995) study, a cohort of 442 workers (437 men, 5 women) exposed to one or more substances including benzidine at a dyestuff factory in Japan during employment between the years of 1935 and 1988, was followed until December 1992 (average observation period, 39.4 years). A significant increased risk for bladder cancer w as found among workers engaged in the manufacture (SMR=63.6) and use (SMR=27) of benzidine, but th e increased risk for cancer mortality for other organs was not significant. It was also found in this study that the risk of bladder cancer increased with duration of exposure to benzidine. In the sole reported animal inhalation study, out bred albino rats of both sexes were exposed to 10-20 mg/m 3 of benzidine dust in air 4 hours/day, 5 days/week for 20 months (Zabezhinskii 1970). Of the 28 experimental rats that survived beyond 13 m onths, 5 were found to have myeloid leukemia, 2 had fibroadenoma of the mammary gland, 1 had a squamous carcinoma of the male mammary gland, 1 had a 25 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS hepatoma, and 1 had a mammary adenocarcinoma. Among the 21 surviving control rats, 2 had mammary gland adenomas. No urinary bladder tumors were reported in either group. The earliest carcinogenic effect (myeloid leukemia) was noted in an exposed an imal after 13 months of the study. This CEL value for cancer in rats is recorded in Table 3-1 and pl otted in Figure 3-1. Several study weaknesses should be noted. Only 28 of 48 (58%) experimental animals survived to 13 months. It is not clear whether this is an indication that the Maximum Tolerated Dose (M TD) was exceeded, because su rvival in the control group may have also been low (21 control rats survived until this time). However, the initial number of control animals used was not reported, and possible reas ons for poor survival in either the experimental or control groups were not discussed. Further, the purity of the benzidine used was not reported, and no mention was made of particle size distribution, or possible dermal and oral absorption from dust accumulation on the skin and grooming, respectively. Therefore, this study can only be considered inconclusive evidence that inhalation of benzidine can produce cancer in rats. EPA has derived an inhalation cancer potency factor of 2.3x10 2 (mg/kg/day)-1 using the linearized multistage model (EPA 1999a). This factor was deri ved from data on bladder tumor incidence in humans occupationally exposed to benzidine as described by Zavon et al. (1973). The corresponding inhalation unit risk is 6.7x10-2 per \u00b5g/m3. The air concentrations corresponding to excess cancer risk levels of 1x10-4, 1x10-5, as indicated in Figure 3-1. 3.2.2 Oral Exposure Few data have been reported on the toxicity (other than carcinogenicity or genotoxicity) of benzidine after oral exposure. However, significant oral e xposure to benzidine is unlikely, particularly for populations not located near waste sites or dye production facilities. Ingestion of benzidine-based dyes may be a more likely occupational exposure scenario than ingestion of benzidine. It has been shown that ingestion of benzidine-based dyes can cause effects in animals similar to effects caused by ingestion of benzidine, and that these dyes can be converted meta bolically and environmentally to benzidine (Gregory 1984). See also Chapter 6. 28 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.2.2.1 Death No studies were located regarding death in humans af ter oral exposure to benzidine. The reported oral LD50 is 214 mg/kg body weight for mice and 309 mg/kg body weight for rats (DOT 1972). Oral doses approximating 200 mg/kg are also estimated to have caused the deaths of rabbits and dogs (Adler 1908). All reliable LOAEL values for death in each species a nd duration category are recorded in Table 3-2 and plotted in Figure 3-2. 3.2.2.2 Systemic Effects No studies were located regarding respiratory, gastroin testinal, musculoskeletal, dermal, or ocular effects in humans or animals after oral exposure to benzidine. The systemic effects observed after oral exposure are discussed below. The highest NOAEL values and all LOAEL values from each reliable study for observed systemic effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 3-2 and plotted in Figure 3-2. Cardiovascular Effects. No studies were located regarding cardiovascular effects in humans after oral exposure to benzidine. One study reported that benzidine administered or ally to 6 rabbits (50 or 100 mg 1 day/week, or approximately 13 or 26 mg/kg/day), and 2 dogs (100 mg 1 day/week, or approximately 7.9 mg/kg/day) for 1958a, 1958b). Five rabbits died during the study and the cause of death w as not reported; also, no controls were used. This study is not considered reliable for the assessment of car diovascular effects and, therefore, is not included in Table 3-2. No other studies were located re garding cardiovascular effects in animals after oral exposure to benzidine. Hematological Effects. No studies were located regarding hematological effects in humans after oral exposure to benzidine. Mice were provided water containing 30-400 ppm benzidine dihydrochloride (equivalent to 2.5-26.2 mg/kg/day of benzidine base) for 40, 60, and 80 weeks (Nelson et al. 1982). Hemosiderin 35 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS pigment in the spleen was found in significant am ounts for both sexes of the two crosses examined (F1 hybrid of C57BL and BALB/C3H strains and subsequent monohybrid cross) at the 40- and 60-week terminations. The increase in the level of pigment was also significant at the 80-week termination in the males. Erythropoiesis in the spleen was significantly increased in females (but not males) for both strains at the 60-and 80-week terminations. The doses at which these effects were first observed were not reported. In another mouse study, macrophages containing hemosiderin pigment were observed in the spleen after lifetime exposures to benzidine at do ses of 10.7-12.0 mg/kg/day, but not at 0-7.2 mg/kg/day (Littlefield et al. 1983, 1984). Though typical hematol ogical examinations were not conducted in these studies, the results suggest that benzidine may be capable of damaging erythrocytes, with a resulting deposit of hemosiderin in the spleen. Hepatic Effects. No studies were located regarding hepatic effects in humans after oral exposure to benzidine. Cirrhosis of the liver was found in rabbits (perhaps al so in dogs, but this was not clearly indicated) orally exposed to approximately 13 or 26 mg/kg/day of benzidine, 1 day/week over a period of 20-128 days (Oida 1958a, 1958b). However, five of the six rabbits died during the study and the cause of death was not reported. Also, no controls were used. This study is not considered reliable for the assessment of hepatic effects and, therefore, is not included in Table 3-2. Cirrhosis of the liver was observed in another rabbit study 8 months following treatment with benz idine (0.5-7.0 grams total dose over periods of up to 3.5 years) (Bonser 1959). The cirrhosis was frequently associated with changes in bile duct tissue. No further details were provided in this abstract; thus, this report is also not included in Table 3-2. Bile duct hyperplasia was observed in rats administered appr oximately 5.3 mg benzidine/kg/day in the drinking water for 6 weeks (De Pass and Morris 1981). Bile duct hyperplasia was also observed in a lifetime mouse study (Littlefield et al. 1983) at benzidine doses of 5.6-12.0 mg/kg/day, but not at lower doses of 0-3.7 mg/kg/day. The effect was more prevalent in females (21% at 10.7 mg/kg/day) than in males (8% at 12 mg/kg/day). The authors hypothesized about a possible hormone-mediated component of the response. No morphological alterations were observed in the livers from mice administered approximately 32 mg benzidine/kg/day in the dr inking water for 6 weeks (DePass and Morris 1982). Renal Effects. No studies were located regarding renal effects in humans after oral exposure to benzidine. 36 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Nephrosis, nephritis, hematuria, and pr oteinuria were reported in rabbits orally exposed to approximately 13 or 26 mg/kg/day of benzidine, 1 day/w eek over a period of 20-128 days (Oida 1958a, 1958b). However, five of the six rabbits died during the study and the cause of death was not reported. Also, no controls were used. This study is not consid ered reliable for the assessment of renal effects and, therefore, is not included in Table 3-2. Protein aceous casts were observed in the renal tubules from rats dosed with approximately 5.3 mg benzidine/kg/day in the drinking water for 6 weeks (DePass and Morris 1981). Although not statistically significant (p<0.10) , Nelson et al. (1982) observed proteinaceous casts in the kidneys of F1 hybrid (C57BL x BALB/c) female mice exposed to benzidine for 60-80 weeks, but the particular doses (between 0 and 26.2 mg/kg/day) causing the effect were not identified. Hematuria and proteinuria were reported in tw o dogs within 2-5 weeks of being orally exposed to 7.9 mg/kg/day of benzidine, 1 day/week over a period of 20-128 days (Oida 1958a, 1958b). Even though no other visible signs of toxicity were noted, recurrent episodes of cystitis were observed in the bladders of seven dogs fed benzidine for 5 years (Spitz et al. 1950). The dogs were exposed by capsule to doses of approximately 17.6 mg/kg/day for the first 15 months , then 26.4 mg/kg/day for the remaining 45 months. Histologically, focal collections of lymphocytes were observed, often forming follicles. There was no notable reaction of the mucosa, and the lesions improved without therapy. Body Weight Effects. No studies were located regarding body weight effects in humans after oral exposure to benzidine. No significant treatment-related changes in body weight were reported in mice administered approximately 32 mg benzidine/kg/day in the dr inking water for 6 weeks (DePass and Morris 1982). Schieferstein (1982) reported decreased body weight gain (greater than 10%) in mice exposed to benzidine at 2.5 mg/kg/day in the drinking water for 80 weeks. Also, Littlefield et al. (1983, 1984) reported that mice administered benzidine in the wate r for 2 years at dose levels of about 1.8 mg/kg/day gained approximately 28% less weight than controls. 3.2.2.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects No studies were located regarding immunological effect s in humans after oral exposure to benzidine. Two animal studies have been reported that address the immunotoxicity of benzidine following oral exposure. In a study by Luster et al. (1992), an unspecified number of female B6C3F 1 mice were exposed by gavage for 5 days to three unspecified doses of benzidine, and were then subjected to a battery of 37 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS immune response assays used to screen for potential immunotoxicity. Based on induced alterations in spleen/body weight ratio, natural killer cell activ ity, T-cell response to mitogen and mixed leukocyte antigens, and on a delayed hypersensitivity respon se, benzidine was classified as an immunotoxicant. Spleen cellularity, thymus/body weight ratio, num ber of B and T lymphocytes as quantified by cell surface markers, and number of splenic lymphoc ytes producing IgM antibody were not altered by benzidine exposure. Rao et al. ( 1971) reported hyperplasia of the lymphoid cells in the spleen and thymic cortex in mice exposed to benzidine dihydrochloride in the feed for 6 weeks; however, the lowest dose at which this effect occurred could not be determined from the study. 3.2.2.4 Neurological Effects No studies were located regarding neurological effect s in humans after oral exposure to benzidine. Spongiform leukoencephalopathy (central nervous system damage resulting in vacuolization of white matter) was observed in mice after lifetime exposure to 20 ppm of benzidine dihydrochloride in drinking water (Littlefield et al. 1983; Morgan et al. 1981). These vacuoles may represent swollen glial cells and/or intramyelinic vacuoles between the larger a xons. Using average weekly dose rate data provided by the authors in another publication concerning th is study (Littlefield et al. 1984), 20 ppm was estimated to be equivalent to a benzidine dose of 1.8 mg/kg/day. The LOAEL value (1.8 mg/kg/day) from this study for neurological effects is recorded in Table 3-2 and plotted in Figure 3-2. 3.2.2.5 Reproductive Effects No studies were located regarding reproductive effects in humans after oral exposure to benzidine. The only information regarding reproductive effects in anim als is that from a lifetime study in mice, which reported a 31% incidence of atrophy of the ovaries in animals given benzidine in the drinking water at a dose level of approximately 7.2 mg/kg/day (80 ppm) compared to 11% in control mice (Littlefield et al. 1983). 3.2.2.6 Developmental Effects In a 5-year retrospective study of residents living near a Superfund site contaminated with benzidine, -naphthylamine, and benzene, no significant increase in incidence rate was detected for any of 37 most common birth defects (only 4 of which were observed) , or in the rate for all combined birth defects 38 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS (Budnick et al. 1984). However, the authors noted that the number of births was small, and that birth defects are often under-reported on birth certificates. Th e extent of actual exposure (if any) to benzidine was not determined. No studies were located regarding developmental eff ects in animals after oral exposure to benzidine. 3.2.2.7 Cancer A retrospective study of residents who lived, during the 1970s near a Superfund site, that was contaminated with benzidine, -naphthylamine, and benzene detected an excess of bladder cancer, leukemia, and other lymphomas, as well as cancers at sever al other sites (salivary gland, larynx, bone and jaw, uterus and chorion, rectum, and breast) (Budnick et al. 1984). The principal routes of potential exposure were not identified, but are likely to have included oral exposure to contaminated water and soil. The specific contribution of environmental benzidin e (if any), or of possible occupational exposure to benzidine or other carcinogens, could not be ascerta ined. A retrospective study of Japanese kimono painters who were exposed to benzidine-based dyes (Direct Black 38, Direct Red 28, Direct Red 17, and Direct Green 1) by licking their brushes and spat ulas indicated an increased risk for bladder tumors (Yoshida 1971; Yoshida and Miyakawa 1973). Of 200 painters who worked for up to 50 years, 17 (8.5%) contracted bladder cancer. When comp ared with 148 controls having urinary disease, this represented a relative risk of 6.8 for these cohorts. The average age-adjusted death rate from bladder cancer for the general population in Japan during 1965 was reported to be less than 3 deaths per 100,000 persons. Although direct exposur e to benzidine was not described, these data are consistent with the concept that benzidine-based dyes may be metaboli cally reduced to free benzidine, and thus cause the same cancer effects. A number of animal studies indicate that oral expos ure to benzidine can increase the incidence of a variety of tumors. In female rats given 3.4 mg/kg/ day once every 3 days for 30 days, 5 out of 10 animals developed mammary carcinomas within 9 months, compar ed to 5 out of 132 in the controls (Griswold et al. 1968). In hamsters fed either 0.1% benzidine base (61 dihydrochloride (equivalent to 44 mg/kg/day benzidine base) in the lifetime diet, malignant and benign multiple cholangiomas, hepatomas, and/or liver carcinomas we re reported in more than 50% of the surviving hamsters (Saffiotti et al. 1967). No bladder pathology was found in these animals. 39 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS In a total of 13 rabbits fed a total dose of 0.5-7.0 gram s of benzidine base in the diet for up to 3.5 years, one female developed a transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder after 2 years, while another female developed adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with wid espread metastasis at 6 years of age (Bonser 1959). The author concluded that two tumors occurring in organs of excretion in 13 rabbits is probably significant, and that it is possible that higher dosag e levels would have caused more tumors. However, the incidence of tumors in control animals was not stated, making it difficult to assess the findings. No bladder tumors or other significant neoplasia were noted in rabbits intermittently given 13 or 26 mg/kg/day (50 or 100 mg weekly doses over 20-128 days; total doses of 0.1-1.4 grams) (Oida 1958a, 1958b). These reports were lacking in experimental de tails. The weekly dosing is difficult to evaluate and histopathological procedures were not adequately described, making the data of limited quantitative value. Spitz et al. (1950) administered benzidine to 1 male and 6 female dogs by capsule for 60 months at a dose of 17.6 mg/kg/day (200 mg daily, 6 days/week fo r 15 months), followed by 26.4 mg/kg/day (300 mg daily, 6 days/week for 45 months). Dosing may ha ve been suspended for brief periods because of recurring cystitis in dogs. One dog developed a urinary epidermoid carcinoma of the bladder at 19 months. It was later reported that three dogs (the longest survivors) of the Spitz et al. (1950) study developed papillomas and carcinomas of the bla dder after 7, 8, and 10 years (Bonser 1959). The most thorough animal study of oral carcinogeni city of benzidine was conducted at the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) using two strains of male and female mice (a total of 3,456 animals) at five dose levels of benzidine di hydrochloride (Frith et al. 1979, 1980; Nelson et al. 1982; Schieferstein 1982). Doses (in water) were 30-400 (equivalent to benzidine doses of 2.5-26.2 mg/kg/day). The mice were sacrificed at 40, 60, and 80 weeks for pathological evaluations. Statistical analysis of th e pathology data and the data pertaining to animal weights, water consumption, survival, and tumor incidences was performed. A series of publications resulted from this study. Hepatocellular alterati ons, hepatocellular adenom as, and hepatocellular carcinomas were all significantly elevated in one or more of the sex-strain combinations, even at the lowest dose level of 30 ppm (2.5 mg/kg/day). The primary target organ observed in the studies was the liver, where dose-response relationships could be observe d. The data suggest that the lesions may first have appeared as foci of cellular alteration (acidoph ilic, basophilic, or vacuolated cellular foci), which may then have given rise to hepatocellular ade nomas, which in turn progressed to hepatocellular carcinomas, the main cause of death among treated an imals. These altered foci are thus considered preneoplastic lesions, an early stage in the progression from normal tissue to frank cancer. 40 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Hepatocellular carcinomas were also observed in mice given as little as 20 ppm of benzidine dihydrochloride in drinking water for about 33 months (Littlefield et al. 1983, 1984). From experimentally derived average dose rates in mice (Littlefield et al. 1984), this equates to a dose of 1.8 mg/kg/day which is presented in Table 3-2. At this same dose, there was also a substantial increase in the fraction of mice displaying Harderian gland adenomas (18-24%) when compared with controls (4-8%). The response generally leveled off at the mid and high doses. Other tumors that occurred at significantly greater rates than in controls were a ngioma of the uterus, lung tumors, and reticulum cell sarcomas. This study also provided information on la tency and sex and strain differences. Female mice were significantly more susceptible to these adverse e ffects than male mice, as was the genetically more homogeneous F 1 stock (BALB/c males x C57BL/6 females) when compared with the more heterogeneous F2-monohybrid cross stock (F1xF1). CEL values from each reliable study for cancer in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 3-2 and plotted in Figure 3-2. EPA has derived an oral cancer potency factor of 2.3x102 (mg/kg/day)-1 using the linearized multistage model (EPA 1999a). This factor was calculated fro m inhalation exposure data reported by Zavon et al. (1973) regarding incidence of bladder tumors in humans occupationally exposed to benzidine. The lifetime average doses that would result in risks of 1x10-4, 1x10-5, in Figure 3-2. Several benzidine-congener-derived dyes during dye manufacture and dye use have been tested for possible carcinogenicity. The need for c onducting such bioassays was based on the known carcinogenicity of benzidine in humans and the r esults of cancer epidemiology studies in Japanese kimono painters exposed congeners empl oyed in the dye industry, were found to increase tumor incidence in rats (Haley 1975). Five chemicals were 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine-based dye), Acid Red 114 (a representative 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine-based dye), and Direct Blue 218 (a metallized 3,3'-dihydroxybenzidine-based dye) (NTP 1990, 1991a , 1991b, 1992, 1994). Rats and mice were used in the Direct Blue 218 study, and only rats were used in the other four bioassays. Direct Blue 218 was administered in the feed and the other chemicals in the drinking water. The following brief summary of the results regarding neoplastic lesions has been taken from Morgan et al. (1994). 3,3'-Dimethoxy\u00ad 41 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS benzidine, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride, Direct Blue 15, and Acid Red 114 all caused a similar spectrum of neoplastic lesions. The primary chem ical-related neoplasms were tumors of the skin, Zymbal's gland, oral cavity epithelium, liver, pre putial/clitoral glands, and intestines of both males and females. Direct Blue 218 induced an entirely different spectrum of neoplastic lesions. Tumor incidences were not as dramatic, and were seen primarily in the oral cavity epithelium of rats, and in the livers of mice. Morgan et al. (1994) noted that quantitativ e comparisons of the carcinogenic potencies of the chemicals other than Direct Blue 218 is difficult b ecause of the lack of dose-response relationships, as well as differences in doses and durations of treatments. 3.2.3 Dermal Exposure 3.2.3.1 Death No studies were located regarding death in humans or animals after dermal exposure to benzidine. 3.2.3.2 Systemic Effects No studies were located regarding respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, musculoskeletal, hepatic, renal, or ocular effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to benzidine. Dermal Effects. One human case of severe, recurrent, allergic eczematous dermatitis from benzidine use has been reported (Baer 1945), but data on exposur e levels were not available. Of 4,600 patients tested over a 5 year period, 231 (5%) showed derm al sensitization to benzidine (Grimalt and Romaguera 1981). Occupational allergic contact dermatitis was clinically diagnosed in 88.5% (208 cases) of such dermally sensitized patients. No studies were located regarding dermal effects in animals after dermal exposure to benzidine. 3.2.3.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects As noted above, allergic contact dermatitis has b een observed in workers occupationally exposed to benzidine (Baer 1945; Grimalt and Romaguera 1981) . No other studies were located regarding immunological effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to benzidine. 42 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS No studies were located regarding the following h ealth effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to benzidine: 3.2.3.4 Neurological Effects 3.2.3.5 Reproductive Effects 3.2.3.6 Developmental Effects 3.2.3.7 Cancer No studies were located regarding the carcinogenic effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to benzidine. Although dermal exposure was identified in many of the occupational studies, the relative contribution to the carcinogenic effect of benzidine could not be quantified. 3.3 GENOTOXICITY The cytogenetic effects of occupational exposure to benzidine and benzidine-based dyes (Direct Black 38 and Direct Blue 6) were studied in workers at a manufacturing plant in Bulgaria having a recognized high risk of occupational cancer (Mirkova and Lalchev 1990). Twenty-three workers exposed for a mean of 15 years were compared with 30 controls presumed to have had no exposure. A statistically significant (10-fold) increase in the number of circulating peripheral lymphocytes displaying chromosomal aberrations was observed in exposed workers when co mpared with controls. The highest frequencies of aberrant lymphocytes were associated with the high est airborne dust concentrations of benzidine (0.42-0.86 mg/m 3) or benzidine-based dyes (7.8-32.3 mg/m3), and with the highest mean levels of benzidine found in the urine (1.8-2.3 \u00b5g/L). The frequency of polyploid lymphocytes was also elevated in workers when compared with controls. No significant association with smoking was observed. A major strength of this study is the monitoring and biomonitoring of benzidine. These data provide clear evidence of benzidine's genotoxicity in humans under occupational exposur e conditions, and are in agreement with oral genotoxicity results from animals and in vitro test systems (see below). Several studies have addressed the in vivo genotoxicity of benzidine in animals following oral or parenteral exposure (Table 3-3). Although early studies were conflicting or equivocal, benzidine was clearly demonstrated to induce bone marrow micronucle i in two strains of male mice (C57BL6 and CBA) 24 and 48 hours after a single administration of 300 mg /kg benzidine by oral gavage (Mirkova and Ashby 1988). The number of micronucleated cells per 1,000 normal cells for test groups (5.75-8.75) was 43 Table 3-3.

HEALTH EFFECTS aLiver cells evaluated in partially hepatectomized mice. - = negative results; + = positive results; DNA = deoxyribonucleic acid 44 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3 times that observed in control groups (2.0-2.9). Th ese findings were extended in a subsequent study in which male C57BL6 mice, treated by oral gavage w ith either a single dose (900 mg/kg) or with three consecutive daily doses (150 or 300 mg/kg), evidenced a positive dose response for bone marrow micronuclei induction (Mirkova 1990). Negative results, however, were reported for a different strain of mice (ICR) treated with single oral gavage doses of 100 or 200 mg benzidine/kg. No significant increases in micronucleated cells were observed in the bone ma rrow of treated male, female, or pregnant female mice (gestation days 16-17), nor in the livers from the fetuses of treated pregnant female mice (Harper et al. 1989). Noting that adult liver is more sensitive than bone marrow to the chromosome damaging effects of benzidine, and that fetal liver can be more sensitive than adult liver for certain chemicals, the authors had speculated that micronuclei might be detectable in fetal liver. Lower doses, nonoptimum sampling time, and/or strain differences may have c ontributed to the negative findings in this study. When administrated by single oral gavage to male rats, 200 mg benzidine/kg induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in liver cells, which is a repair r esponse to DNA damage (Ashby and Mohammed 1988; Ashby et al. 1990). In a study in mice, intraperitoneal administration of benzidine to pregnant dams increased the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythroc ytes in the liver of fetuses, which suggested that benzidine (or metabolites) can cross the placenta (Sanderson and Clark 1993). When tested in many in vitro assays (Table 3-4), benzidine has generally tested positive for reverse mutation in Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation (e.g., liver S-9) (Ames et al. al. Pueyo et et al. 1981; Zeiger et al. 1992); negative for SOS DNA repair in Escherichia coli (Von der Hude et al. 1988); positive for mutation in yeast (Buchholz et al. 1992; Mitchell and Gilbert 1991); positive (Oberly et al. 1990) or negative (Phillips et al. 1990) for gene mutation in Chinese hamster ovary cells; positive (Fassina et al. 1992) or negative (O'Donovon 1990; Oglesby et al. 1983) for gene mutation in Chinese hamster V 79 cells; and positive (TK locus) or negative (HGPRT locus) for gene mutation in mouse lymphoma cells (Henderson et al . 1990; Myhr and Caspary 1988). Benzidine has also tested positive for chromosome breaks (Swenberg et al. 1976) and sister chromatid exchange (Grady et al. 1986; Lindahl-Kiessling et al. 1989) in cultured human and animal cells; generally positive in cultured hepatocytes for unscheduled Williams transformation (Ashby et al. 1978; Pienta 1980); and negative in cultured mammalian cells (but positive with calf thymus DNA) in the absence of exogenous activation for DNA adduct formation (Phillips et al. 1990). 45 Table 3-4.

HEALTH EFFECTS 3.4 TOXICOKINETICS Many studies have been devoted to clarifying the mechanism and etiology of bladder and other cancers caused by benzidine in animals. Both benzidine t oxicity and the elimination of benzidine from the body are substantially mediated by metabolic transformation. While some metabolites are detoxication products, others are precursors of proximate and ultimate carcinogens. The latter form adducts with nucleic acids and is presumed to initiate carcinogenesis. The differences in target organs among rodents, dogs, and humans are related to species differences in their metabolic pathways and enzyme activities. No studies have been reported that indicate that benzidine is absorbed by an y process other than passive diffusion. Absorption follows inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure, with the inhalation and dermal routes probably being the most likely for humans. In general, there appears to be a rapid plasma clearance of absorbed benzidine, followed by a mo re gradual metabolism and clearance of benzidine metabolites (Lakshmi et al. 1990a; Shah and Guthrie 1983). Enterohepatic circulation may contribute to the persistence and toxicity of metabolites of benzid ine in the bile (Chipman and Mohn 1989; Percy et al. 1989). Benzidine metabolism involves multiple a nd complex enzymatic pathways, the relative importance of which may vary according to both species and tissue (Babu et al. 1992, 1993a, 1994a, 1994b; Wang Zenser et al. 1996). In the liv er, benzidine is thought to be N-acetylated and by the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase by prostaglandin H synthase or oxidation by lipoxygenases may play a significant role in benzidine metabolism. Excretion of benz idine, its metabolites, and their conjugates appears approximately equally divided between the urine and the bile/feces (Lakshmi et al. 1990a; Shah and Guthrie 1983). Some studies also indicate that benzidine-based dyes can be metabolized to benzidine, and that human exposure to the dyes is associated with bladder cancer (Genin 1977; Yoshida and Miyakawa 1973). After oral administration, benzidine dyes can be metabolized to benzidine by microflora of the gastrointestinal tract (Bos et al. 1986). These investigators detected mutagenicity in the urine of ordinary (intestinal microflora-containing), but not germ-free rats after oral administration of two benzidine-based dyes, whereas benzidine produced mutagenic urine in both germ -free and ordinary rats. It is generally agreed that because of the size of the molecule, benzidine-based dyes are unlikely to be absorbed intact; therefore, azo reduction occurs most likely in the intestine and less likely in the liver. 52 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.4.1 Absorption 3.4.1.1 Inhalation Exposure No quantitative studies were located regarding absorp tion in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to benzidine. However, mean urinary levels of benzidine in workers exposed to 0.005-17.6 mg/m3 benzidine in air increased 4-fold (from 0.01 to 0.04 mg/L) during the course of a workshift, suggesting significant and relatively rapid absorption and excretion. The available data are highly variable, and it is not clear whether high air concentrations correlated w ith high urinary levels. The relative contribution of dermal or oral absorption was also not rigorously examined in this study (Zavon et al. 1973). Similarly, urine from workers exposed to the dust of Di rect Black 38 was found to (D ewan et al. 1988; NIOSH 1980c). In addition, it is possible that significant oral exposure to the dyes occurred since inhaled particles are frequently coughed up or brought up by ciliary action and then swallowed. However, the relative contributions of pulmonary and dermal absorption were not discussed in these pub lications. More recent studies have also provided evidence of inhalation absorption in workers exposed to benzidine (DeMarini et al. 1997; Rothman et al. 1996a). 3.4.1.2 Oral Exposure No quantitative studies were located regarding absorp tion in humans or animals after oral exposure to benzidine. Qualitative evidence of absorption after oral administration of 3H-benzidine to mice in their drinking water was indicated by covalent binding of a benzid ine metabolite to DNA in the liver (Martin et al. 1982). A similar experiment with dogs that were fed 3H-benzidine by capsule resulted in covalent binding to DNA in the epithelium of the bladder (Beland et al. 1983). Another study demonstrated transport of benzidine (but not benzidine-based dyes) across the mucosa of an isolated segment of rat intestine in a perfusion chamber, suggesting that benzidine, but not benzidine-based dyes as such, can be absorbed in the intestines (Bos et al. 1986). 53 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.4.1.3 Dermal Exposure It is generally agreed that benzidine bases and salts can be readily absorbed through the intact human skin (Ferber et al. 1976; Meigs et al. 1951, 1954; Zavon et al. 1973). The salts are produced by strong acids acting on a weak base, and consequently, readily hydrolyze in aqueous media to yield some free base at equilibrium. The log 10 octanol-water partition coefficient of the base is reported to be 1.36 (Lu et al. 1977). This is considered sufficiently high to allow significant dermal absorption, particularly during long term exposures or when exposed populations ar e subject to warm, humid weather and/or strenuous working conditions that result in excessive perspiration. Levels of benzidine and its metabolites were measure d in the urine of industrially exposed workers in March and in August of 1958 (Sciarin i and Meigs 1961). During the cooler weather of March, a mean of 5 mg/L of benzidine and its metabolites was reported, compared to a mean of 21.8 mg/L during the warm weather of August. The highest excretion was 31 mg/L in August. Given the conditions observed at this plant, these urinary levels are probably largely due to dermal contact with dust containing benzidine. This conclusion is supported by ear lier data showing that daily showers and fresh work clothes reduced the quantity of benzidine and its metabolites excreted in the urine of exposed workers (Meigs et al. 1951). In animals, radioactivity was observed in tissues, urine, and feces following application of 1 mg/kg of radioactive benzidine for 1, 8, and 24 hours to the sh aved skin of male F344 rats in a well-controlled study in which the animals were prevented from grooming themselves and licking at the site of benzidine application (Shah and Guthrie 1983). At 24 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered from the skin site, indicating that approximately half of the app lied benzidine had penetrated the skin. Since almost 50% of the radioactivity was recovered in the excreta, the results suggested that 50% of the applied dose was absorbed. A preliminary report submitted to EPA under Section 8(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) stated that nearly all of the benzidine-based dye, Direct Black 38, is absorbed directly through the intact skin of rabbits (Intern ational Business Machines 1979). However, this was later attributed to probable ingestion (licking of th e skin) (Aldrich 1993). In contrast, Aldrich et al. (1986) applied radiolabeled Direct Black 38 to the shaved dorsal skin of the male F344 rats and New Zealand rabbits that were prevented from licking the s ite of application, and then measured radioactivity in urine and feces 24-144 hours following dye application. Approximately 3% of the administered radioactivity was detected in the urine and 5% in the feces of rabbits at 144 hours. Excretion of radioactivity was negligible in rats (0.05% in urin e and 0.16% in feces). Because skin penetration by the whole dye was considered very unlikely, the absorb ed and excreted radioactivity in the rabbits was presumed to represent benzidine liberated by azo-reduction of the dye. 54 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.4.1.4 Other Routes of Exposure In an in vitro study designed to assess the percutane ous absorption and penetration of 14C-benzidine in combination with various other chemical mixtures wh ich might be found in occ upational settings, isolated perfused porcine skin flaps were topically treat ed with (SnCl2), or various combinations of these mixtures (Baynes et al. 1996). Flow- through diffusion call systems were also utilized. Absorption was defined as the total amount of radioactivity detected in the perfusate for the en tire 8-hour perfusion period. Skin penetration was defined as the sum of total absorption and total ra dioactivity in the skin. Maximum absorption (and maximum penetration over an 8-hour exposure period were approximately 3 and 22%, respectively, for a mixture of benzidine+DMSO+surfactant+vasodilator. It was noted that DMSO enhanced absorption more than acetone, and that the reducing agent inhib ited benzidine absorption. It was suggested that chemical-biological interactions between the surfactant and vasodilator might enhance while chemical-chemical between benzidine and SnCl 2 might inhibit benzidine absorption. The percentage of the dose absorbed in this study is much less than the approximately 50% dermal absorption reported by Shah and Guthrie (1983) in rats in vivo . 3.4.2 Distribution There is no information regarding pharmacokinetics of benzidine in children nor is it known whether benzidine can be stored and excreted in breast milk . Although there have been no direct measurements to determine whether it can cross the placenta, there is some indirect evidence that benzidine and/or its metabolites do. This evidence is based on the results of a study in which intraperitoneal administration of benzidine to pregnant mice resulted in the induction of micronuclei in the liver of fetuses (Sanderson and Clark 1993); however, when pregnant mice were ora lly exposed to benzidine, there was no increase in micronucleated cells either in their livers or the liv ers of their fetuses (Harper et al. 1989). There is no information on whether benzidine can be stored in maternal tissues and be mobilized during pregnancy or lactation. 55 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.4.2.1 Inhalation Exposure No studies were located regarding distribution in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to benzidine. 3.4.2.2 Oral Exposure No studies were located regarding distribution in hum ans or animals after oral exposure to benzidine. 3.4.2.3 Dermal Exposure No studies were located regarding distribution in humans after dermal exposure to benzidine. One study was found that reports data on the distribution of benzidine in rats following dermal exposure (Shah and Guthrie 1983). When radiolabeled benzidine was applied to the skin of rats, radioactivity was distributed approximately as follows (percentage of applied radioactivity 1, 8, and 24 hours after application): blood (0.2, 0.3, and 0.7%), liver (1.5, 1. 0, and 0.7%), lung (0.09, 0.2, and 0.2%), intestines (1.0, 14.0, and 1.3%), stomach (0.5, 0.4, and 0.08%), carcass (1.9, 4.1, and 6.9%), urine (0.08, 4.1, and 22.8%), and feces (0.01, 0.7, and 18.7%). Twenty-four hours after administration, approximately half of the applied radioactivity remained at the site of application. 3.4.2.4 Other Routes of Exposure Following intravenous injection of 0.2 mg/kg of radi olabeled benzidine, radioactivity was distributed rapidly throughout the body in rats, dogs, and monkeys (K ellner et al. 1973). In rats, substantial activity was found after 4 hours in the lung, the small and large intestines, the bladder, and the kidney, with smaller amounts in all other tissues and fluids examin ed. Findings were generally similar in dogs, except that there was a 10- to 15-fold higher level of radioactivity in the bladder tissue (consistent with benzidine bladder carcinogenicity in dogs), and much lower activity (about 10% that of rats) in the lung. Approximately 90% of the radioactivity was cleared from the blood during the first 24 hours after dosing, with the remainder being cleared more slowly. Hal f-lives of radioactivity in the blood from day 1 to day 6 or 7 were 65 hours in rats and 88 hours in dogs. Af ter 7 days, activity was much reduced in all organs examined from rats, dogs, and monkeys. Highest resi dual activity was found in the liver for all three species. Expressed as concentration of benzidine in wet tissue, the mean liver value for rats was 56 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 0.042 \u00b5g/g, and values were 0.087-0.19 \u00b5g/g for three dogs, and 0.01 and 0.027 \u00b5g/g for the two monkeys. Plasma clearance of benzidine in dogs has been found to be fairly rapid (of the amount present 5 minutes after infusion, approximately 10% remained afte r 5 hours), while metabolism and metabolite clearance occur more gradually. In a study of four dogs over a 5-hour period following intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg radiolabeled 1990a), the initial plasma half-life of benzidine was reported to be approximately 30 minutes, while that fo r total radiolabel (benzidine plus metabolites) was approximately 3 hours. Five hours after infusion, 75% of recovered radioactivity was found collectively in the bile (12-25%), urine (23-52%), and carcass muscle (15-30%). Significant amounts of radioactivity were also detected in fat (3-8%), the liver (4-8%), and plasma (2-7%). Smaller quantities were found in the stomach, intestines, spleen, kidney, heart, and lungs. While the bladder contained the lowest fraction of recovered radioactivity (0.1%) , the bladder transitional epithelium exhibited a consistently higher concentration of bound radioactivity than bladder muscle. In liver, kidney, bladder muscle, and bladder epithelium, the majority of radioactivity was bound to protein. Smaller amounts were also bound to DNA. Lynn et al. (1984) performed a similar study in rats after intravenous injection of radiolabeled benzidine. Tissues retaining the most radioactivity after 3 days were muscle and liver. A higher amount was found in the stomach as well. Activity was low in the bladder; this is consistent with the liver, but not the bladder, being a target or gan for benzidine-induced carcinogenesis in rats. The importance of enterohepatic circulation has been demonstrated in both rats and mice, where biliary benzidine and benzidine metabolites can be reabsorbed from the intestines and transported again to the liver (Chipman and Mohn 1989). This enterohepatic r ecycling contributes to the persistence, the further metabolism, and presumably the hepatotoxi city of benzidine and its metabolites. 3.4.3 Metabolism There is substantial information available from human, animal, and in vitro studies regarding various aspects of benzidine metabolism. Numerous in vivo metabolites have been reported in a variety of species and a brief discussion of the major ones can be found in earlier EPA documents (EPA 1980a, 1986c) and in more recent publications (Whysner et al. 1996; Zenser et al. 1998). As a general guide, Figure 3-3 presents some of the principal features of several metabolic pathways thought to be involved or potentially involved in the metabolism of benzidin e. Although there is no evidence suggesting that the metabolism of benzidine is substantially influenced by route of exposure, there are clear differences in Figure 3-3. Metabolic Schemes for Benzidine H H H HH P -450 NATNH2 OAT H2N NH2 Ac N Ac PRX = peroxidase 58 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS metabolism among species or organs. It is not the pur pose of this section to present an exhaustive review of all of the studies that investigated the meta bolism of benzidine, but to summarize some basic information from the main contributors to this t opic and to provide a foundation for the understanding of the mechanism of carcinogenicity of benzidine, which is further discussed in Section 3.5.2. The urine of humans exposed to benzidine has b een reported to contain free Following oral or in travenous administration of benzidine to rats, at least 17 metabolites were identified in the urine or bile, principally (Lynn et al. 1984). Similar findings were reported using isolated perfused rat liver (Lynn et al. 1983). Results from these and also from more recent studies suggest that three main chemical reactions are involved in the metabolism of benzidine: N- acetylation, N-oxidation, and N-glucuronidation. Because primary amines are easier to oxidize than the acetylated amide products, N-acetylation is considered a detoxification reaction and competes with N-oxidation. Also, because amides do not form glucuronides, N-glucuronidation and N-acetylation are also competing pathways. The prevalence of any one of these reactions is species-specific and will ultimately determine the potential development of organ-specific cancer. These three pathways are discussed below. N-Acetylation is a reaction that involves the transfer of acetate to the nitrogen or oxygen atom of aromatic amines, hydrazines, and N-hydroxylamines, catalyzed by N-acetyltransferase Two NAT isozymes, NAT1 and NAT2, have been reported to differ significantly in their intrinsic stabilities and acceptor substrate selectivity. In several species, including humans, acetylator polymorphism results in rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylator phenotypes. The acetylation of benzidine was studied in liver sli ces from rats and humans (Lakshmi et al. 1995a) and dogs (Lakshmi et al. 1995b). In rat liver slices incubated for 1 hour with [H 3]benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine represented 8.8 and 73% of the total radioactivity recovered, respectively. No unmetabolized benzidine was detected, indicating that rats favor N,N'-diacetylbenzidine formation. In contrast, of the total radioactivity recovered from human liver slices, 19% was benzidine, 34% inhibitor paraoxon was included in the experiment with human liver slices, 2% of the radioactivity was recovered as benzidine, 24% as N-acetylbenzidine, and 51% as N,N'-diacetylbenzidine. These findings suggested that 59 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS humans favor N-acetylbenzidine formation, and th at a deacetylase influences hepatic metabolism of benzidine more than specific NAT genotype (this issu e is further discussed in Sections 3.5.2 and 3.10). Similar experiments conducted with dog liver slices showed that benzidine was converted to metabolites more polar than benzidine; no acetylated metabolites we re detected (Lakshmi et al. 1995b). This suggests that the dog is a nonacetylator with respect to benzidin e and, as explained further in Section 3.5.2, this is consistent with the fact that no acetylated DNA a dduct was observed in this species. In contrast, N'-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-N-acetylbenzidine w as the major DNA adduct detected following administration of benzidine to rats and mice and of N-acetylbenzidine to hamsters (Kennelly et al. 1984; Martin et al. 1982), in rat liver in vitro (Frederick et al. 1985), and in exfoliated urothelial cells of exposed humans (Rothman et al. 1996a). Further studies of the acetylation of benzidine using recombinant NAT1 and NAT2 showed that NAT1 had higher K m and Vmax values than NAT2 and that N-acetylbenzidine was a preferred substrate for NAT1 (Zenser et al. 1996). Moreover, a higher acetylation ratio was observed in liver slices possessing the NAT1*10 compared to NAT1*4 allele, indicating that NAT1 may exhibit a polymorphic expression in human liver. The NADPH-dependent oxidation of benzidine has b een studied by Lakshmi who showed that microsomes of cytochrome P-450 (families 1-3) confirmed that benzidine was metabolized by cytochrome P-4501A1/1A2. This metabolite had been found to be the most prominent urinary metabolite in workers exposed to benzidine (Sciarini and Meigs 1961). An earlier study had demonstrated that N-oxidation of N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine occurred in rat and mouse liv er subcellular fractions fortified with NADPH and NADH (Frederick et al. 1985). In both species, N-oxidation of N-acetylbenzidine to N'-hydroxy\u00adN-acetylbenzidine was faster than the formation of N-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine. Further studies by Lakshmi (1996b) showed that both control and -naphthoflavone-treated rat liver microsomes oxidized N-acetylbenzidine and N'N'-diacetylbenzidine and th at the relative rate of formation of oxidized compounds was N'-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine > N-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine >> N-hydroxy\u00adN,N'-diacetylbenzidine. Lakshmi (1996b) also pr esented evidence suggesting that P-4501A1 activity was more involved than P-4501A2 and that, under the c onditions of the experiment, N-oxidation exceeded ring oxidation. Glucuronidation is a major metabolic pathway fo r generating water soluble substances from toxic substances. Glucuronidation of aromatic amines is carried out by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, which 60 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS are membrane-bound enzymes of the endoplasmic reticulum and that exist in multiple forms. The role of glucuronidation in the metabolism and carcinogenicity of benzidine has been evaluated in numerous studies (Babu et al. 1992, 1993a, 1994a, 1994b, 1995). In th e study of Babu et al. (1992), the influence of glucuronidation in the metabolism and carcinogenicity of benzidine was determined using dog liver slices and microsomes. This study demonstrated that the half lives of purified N-benzidine glucuronide in dog urine at 37 E C were 99, 25, and 3 minutes at pH 7.3, 6.3, and 5.3, respectively. It was also shown by Babu et al. (1992) that the N-glucuronide of benzidin e was stable in dog plasma at pH 9.3. While the N-glucuronide was found bound to plasma, the binding was weaker than that shown by benzidine. Glucuronide formation of the N-hydroxy metabo lites of N-acetylbenzidine (Babu et al. 1995) and N-acetyl-N'-glucuronidation by human, dog, and rat liv er (Babu et al. 1993a) was also studied. Human liver slices glucuronidated benzidine and N-acetyl benzidine and the proportion of benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine glucuronidated was affected by th e extent of acetylation (Babu et al. 1994a). In contrast to dogs, N-glucuronidation appeared to represent a major pathway for the metabolism of benzidine in humans. Furthermore, results from expe riments with inhibitors of glucuronidation in human liver microsomes suggested that more than one UDP-glucuronosyltransferase metabolizes benzidine (Babu et al. 1994a). Recently, the same group of investigators studied the capacity of five different human recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in COS-1 cells to glucuronide benzidine and its metabolites and found that UGT1A9 exhibited the hi ghest relative rate of metabolism followed by UGT1A4 > UGT1A6 > UGT2B7 >UGT1A1 (Ciotti et al. 2000). UGT1A9 was effective the two hydroxamic acids, oxy-N-acetylbenzidine and N-hydroxy-N,N'-diacetyl 2.3-fold higher rate for N'-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine than UGT1A9. Additional studies by the same group of investigators showed that incubation of N-acetylbenzidine with human liver slices produced a significant amount of N-acetylbenzidine-N'-glucuronide and that rat liver slices needed a much higher concentration of N'-acet ylbenzidine to produce the glucuronide (Babu et al. 1993a). liver slices (Babu liver slices did not produce N'-acetylglucuronide. Liver microsomes from human, rat, and dog produced N-acetyl\u00adbenzidine-N'-glucuronide and the relative glucuronidation rate of acetylbenzidine was human >> dog > rat. The fact that glucuronidation of N-acetylbenzidine occurred in dog microsomes but not in dog liver slices suggests that dogs rapidly metabolized N-acetylbe nzidine, and that deacetylation to benzidine is a major pathway in this species; lack of glucuronida tion of N-acetylbenzidine was essentially due in part to lack of substrate. 61 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Human liver microsomes were also found to glucur onidate N-hydroxymetabolites of N-acetylbenzidine (Babu et al. 1995). of glucur was N'-hydroxy-N,N'-diacetylbenzidine >> N'-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine = benzidine > N-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine. At pH 5.5 and \u00b0C, half-lives of the conjugates of N-acetylbenzidine, N'-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine, and N-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine were 7.5 minutes, 3. 5 hours, and 1.8 hours, respectively. Much longer half-lives were obtained for the glucuronides of acet ylbenzidine and N'-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine when the incubation was carried out at pH 7.4. Compared with N-acetylbenzidine, glucuronides of its N-hydroxymetabolites are more stable at acidic pH. Thus, in acidic urine, it would be more likely that the glucuronide conjugate of N-acetylbenzidine would be hydrolized than those of its N-hydroxy-metabolites. It is not known whether metabolism in adult humans differs qualitatively or quantitatively from metabolism in children or fetuses. However, the expression of two enzyme families (NAT2 and glucuronosyltransferase [UGT]) that contribute to benzidine metabolism is known to vary develop\u00ad mentally (Leeder and Kearns 1997). There is so me NAT2 activity present in 16-week-old fetuses. Almost all infants show the slow metabolizer phenot ype between birth and the age of two months. NAT2 reaches the adult phenotype distribution in infants at 4-6 months, and by 1-3 years, adult activity is present. For UGT, ontogeny is isozyme-specific, and adult activity is reached at about 6-18 months. The expression of P-450 enzymes varies developmentally as well, but the precise P-450 isozymes involved in metabolism of benzidine are not known. The relevance of metabolism to the carcinogenic proper ties of benzidine is summarized in Section 3.5.2. 3.4.4 Elimination and Excretion 3.4.4.1 Inhalation Exposure No quantitative studies were located regarding excre tion in humans or animals after inhalation been demonstrated in the urine of workers who were potentially exposed to a number of benzidine-based dyes (D ewan et al. 1988; can be reduced to free benzidine by azoreductases of the liver and intestinal microflora. Exposure is assumed to have been largely by inhalation, but dermal expos ure may also have been significant. Conversely, inhalation exposure was likely a factor in several occupational studies showing urinary excretion where 62 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS dermal exposure to benzidine was reported as the prin cipal route (Meigs et al. 1951, 1954; Sciarini and Meigs 1961). 3.4.4.2 Oral Exposure Information regarding excretion in humans after oral exposure is extremely limited. After a single oral dose of 1.4 mg/kg/day, a human was found to excrete free benzidine, monoacetylbenzidine, and diacetylbenzidine (Engelbertz and Babel 1953), while in another study (Troll et al. 1963), six humans excreted N-hydroxyacetyl amino compounds when dosed with 2.9 mg/kg/day benzidine. The major route of excretion in rats after a single oral administration of 0.5-50 mg/kg radiolabeled benzidine appeared to be via the feces (Lynn et al. 1984). At the lowest dose studied, 74% of the radiolabel was excreted in the feces during the first 3 days after exposure, as opposed to only 17% in the urine. With increasing dose the percentage of radiolab el excreted in the feces d ecreased, while that in the urine increased. At the low and mid-level doses (0.5 and 5.0 mg/kg), the major radiolabeled compounds were identified as 3-hydroxy-N,N'-diacetylbenzidine and free benzidine (2%). As the dose was increased (50 mg/kg), the percentage of N-hydroxy\u00adN,N'-diacetylglucuronide increased substantia lly (to 24%), largely at the expense of N,N'-diacetylbenzidine (reduced to 4%). No radioactivity was detected in expired air. The analysis of urine and feces after intravenous injection of benzidin e confirmed that feces was the main excretory route of radioactivity (Section 3.4.4.4) (Kellner et al. 1973; Lynn et al. 1984). Oral exposure of monkeys to 10 or 100 mg of benzidin e resulted in the urinary excretion of free benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine (Rinde and Troll 1975). Th e combined 72-hour excretion of these two compounds represented only a small fraction (1.5%) of the administ ered dose in contrast to the approximately 6% for these two compounds reported by Lynn et al. (1984) in rats. 3.4.4.3 Dermal Exposure Urinary excretion of benzidine and its metabolit es was found to occur in humans during workshift exposure, which was determined to be primarily dermal, although inhalation may also have been a contributory route (Meigs et al. 1951, 1954; Sciarini and Meigs 1961). Mean concentration of urinary compounds detected after exposure in the spring we re: benzidine (0.28 mg/L), When determined duri ng hot, humid summer weather, these values increased 1.5- to 5-fold, presumably due to enhanced dermal contact and subsequent absorption. Fecal excretion was not determined. When radiolabeled benzidine was applied dermally to rats, radiolabel was detected in both the urine and feces as early as 1 hour after treatment (Shah and Guthrie 1983). Excretion was significantly greater (6\u00ad to 8-fold) in urine than in feces during the first 8 hours, but by 24 hours, it was virtually the same for both routes (23% in urine, 19% in feces). Identifi cation of the excreted products was not performed. 3.4.4.4 Other Routes of Exposure The excretion of benzidine after other routes of e xposure has been studied in several animal species. Following intravenous exposure of rats to 0.2 or 2. 5 mg/kg radiolabeled benzidine, the majority of radiolabel was excreted in the feces during the first 3-7 days (63-80%), as opposed to in the urine (17-29%) (Kellner et al. 1973; Lynn et al. 1984). Expe riments with bile duct cannulated rats indicated that virtually all fecal metabolites originate via biliary excretion (Lynn et and levels were similar in bile, except that about half of the 3-hydroxy-N,N'-diacetylbenzid ine glucuronide was replaced by the 3-glutathione\u00ad N,N'-diacetylbenzidine conjugate. In contrast to the findings in rat studies, urinary excretion in dogs after intravenous benzidine injection has been reported to range from 1.0 to 2.5 times that found in the bile or feces (Kellner et al. 1973; Lakshmi et al. 1990a) up to about 10 times in an ol der report (Sciarini and Meigs 1958). About 30% of the radiolabel excreted in the urine or bile was identified as free benzidine. 3-Hydroxybenzidine was a major metabolite (6%) in the bile, but not in th e urine, where it apparently appeared as various conjugates. No acetylated metabolites were excreted , in keeping with the lack of N-acetylase activity in dogs. The earlier study reported that urinary concentr ations of free benzidine ranged from 2 to 9%, and concentrations of 3-monohydroxybenzidine or its su lfur-conjugate ranged from 25 to 50% (Sciarini and Meigs 1958). Excretion patterns in three monkeys following intrave nous injections of 0.2 mg/kg benzidine varied too substantially to make generalizati ons (Kellner et al. 1973). Cumulative excretion during the first 7 days 64 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS varied from 30 to 70% in the urine, and from 5 to 36% in the feces. Thin-layer chromatography of urine samples was thought to indicate the presence of N-acet ylated benzidine metabolites; however, these were not identified. Intraperitoneal injection of benzidine in rats led to the biliary excretion of bioactivated metabolites as indicated by the bile's induction of nuclear anomalies in intestinal epithelial cells (Percy et al. 1989), or bacterial mutagenicity in a host-mediated assay (Chipman and Mohn 1989). injection of with 100 mg/kg benzidine, benzidin e and its metabolites were found in the urine in the pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models use mathematical descriptions of the uptake and disposition of chemical substances to quantitativel y describe the relationships among critical biological processes (Krishnan et al. 1994). PBPK models are also called biologically based tissue dosimetry models. PBPK models are increasingly used in risk assessments, primarily to predict the concentration of potentially toxic moieties of a chemical that will be delivered to any given target tissue following various combinations of route, dose level, and test speci es (Clewell and Andersen 1985). Physiologically based pharmacodynamic (PBPD) models use mathematical descriptions of the dose-response function to quantitatively describe the relationship between target tissue dose and toxic end points. PBPK/PD models refine our understanding of complex quantitative dose behaviors by helping to delineate and characterize the relationships between: (1) the external/exposure concentration and target tissue dose of the toxic moiety, and (2) the target tissue dose and observed responses (Andersen et al. 1987; Andersen and Krishnan 1994). These models ar e biologically and mechanistically based and can be used to extrapolate the pharmacokinetic behavior of chemical substances from high to low dose, from route to route, between species, and between subpopulations within a species. The biological basis of PBPK models results in more meaningful extrapolations than those generated w ith the more conventional use of uncertainty factors. 65 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS The PBPK model for a chemical substance is deve loped in four interconnected steps: (1) model representation, (2) model parametrization, (3) model simulation, and (4) model validation (Krishnan and Andersen 1994). In the early 1990s, validated PBPK models were developed for a number of toxicologically important chemical substances, both volatile and nonvolatile (Krishnan and Andersen 1994; Leung 1993). PBPK models for a particular substance require estimates of the chemical substance- specific physicochemical parameters, and species-specific physiological and biological parameters. The numerical estimates of these model parameters are incor porated within a set of differential and algebraic equations that describe the pharmacokinetic processes. Solving these differential and algebraic equations provides the predictions of tissue dose. Comput ers then provide process simulations based on these solutions. The structure and mathematical expressions used in PBPK models significantly simplify the true complexities of biological systems. If the uptake and disposition of the chemical substance(s) is adequately described, however, this simplification is desirable because data are often unavailable for many biological processes. A simplified scheme redu ces the magnitude of cumulative uncertainty. The adequacy of the model is, therefore, of great importance, and model validation is essential to the use of PBPK models in risk assessment. PBPK models improve the pharmacokinetic extrapola tions used in risk assessments that identify the maximal (i.e., the safe) levels for human exposure to chemical substances (Andersen and Krishnan 1994). PBPK models provide a scientifically sound means to predict the target tissue dose of chemicals in humans who are exposed to environmental levels (for example, levels that might occur at hazardous waste sites) based on the results of studies where doses were higher or were administered in different species. Figure 3-4 shows a conceptualized representation of a PBPK model. No PBPK modeling studies were located for benzidine. 3.5 MECHANISMS OF ACTION 3.5.1 Pharmacokinetic Mechanisms There have been no reports that provide any data th at benzidine is absorbed by any process other than passive diffusion, regardless of the route of exposure. Benzidine appears readily absorbed across the Figure 3-4.

Source: adapted from Krishnan et al. 1994 67 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS intestinal mucosa (Bos et al. 1986), through the skin (Aldrich et al. 1986; Meigs et al. 1951; Shah and Guthrie 1983), and probably by pulmonary tissue as well (Zavon et al. 1973). Benzidine and/or its metabolites are distributed thr oughout most of the body after dermal exposure in rats (Shah and Guthrie 1983), and after injection in rats and dogs (Kellner et al. 1973). No evidence has been reported to indicate that distribution is mediated by any carrier or binding protein, although conjugation of partially bioactivated benzidine metabolites with gl ucuronide may aid in their transport to target sites (e.g., from liver to bladder). In dogs administered benzidine intravenously, be nzidine-glucuronide was a major metabolite in plasma (Babu et al. 1992). There is evidence in rats (patterns of genotoxic effects induced in the intestine by bile) to suggest that enterohepatic circulati on may be involved in the persistence and/or further bioactivation of be nzidine reactive metabolites (Chipman and Mohn 1989; Percy et al. 1989). 3.5.2 Mechanisms of Toxicity Cancer is the principal and best documented toxic effect of benzidine in both humans (Bi et al. 1992; Bulbulyan et al. 1995; Delzell et Xue-Yun et et al. and animals (Bonser 1959; Frith et al. 1979, 1980; Griswold et al. Littlefield et al. 1984; Nelson many other benzidine is postulated to require metabolic activation to electrophilic derivatives in order to manifest its carcinogenicity and genotoxicity through covalent binding with DNA (Beland et al. 1983; Brouns et al. 1982; Iba 1987; Lang and Iba 1988). One metabolic scheme for bladder cancer, summarized by Wang et al. (1990), involves N-acetylation, N-hydroxylation in th e liver, transport of the glucuronide conjugate of the resulting intermediate to the bladder, then hydr olysis of the conjugate followed by absorption and ultimate activation via O-acetylation. This scheme was based on results from experiments in rats with implanted heterotrophic bladders (Wang et al. 1990). In order to circumvent systemic circulation and nonbladder-associated metabolism, benzidine and several metabolites were instilled once a week for 20 weeks directly into these heterotrophic bladders. Heterotrophic bladder cancer was observed in 1 of 39 control animals, 1 of 29 treated with benzidine, 18 of 30 treated with N'-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine, and in all 28 treated with N'-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzid ine N'-glucuronide. This, however, did not entirely explain the fact that benzidine induces primarily liver cancer in rats, whereas dogs and humans develop bladder cancer as a result of exposure to benzidine. Studies by Zenser and coworkers have provided a 68 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS hypothesis that is supported by experimental data. Based on the fact that rats favor acetylation of benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine (Lakshmi et al. 1995a), it was proposed that N-acetylated\u00ad N'-glucuronide would not accumulate in rat urine because (1) little N-acetylbenzidine is available and (2) rat hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity for N-acetylbenzidine is much lower than in humans. Transient increases in hepatic N-acetylbenzidine that might occur because deacetylation could lead to N-oxidation to hydroxylamine, or N,N'-diacetylbe nzidine could undergo N- oxidation subsequent or N,O-transacetylation to yield mono or diacetylated DNA adducts seen in rat liver. Undetectable or low levels of urinary benzidine or N-acetylbenzidine and/or their glucuronides is consistent with the low incidence of bladder cancer in rats. Results from Morton et al. (1980) demonstrated that in rodents, N-hydroxy-N,N'-di acetylbenzidine can be esterified to an electrophilic reactant by hepatic sulfotransferases and suggested the involvement of this metabolite in the liver carcinogenicity of benzidine. In humans, Lakshmi et al. (1995a) proposed that be nzidine and N-acetylbenzidine are glucuronidated in the liver and transported to the bladder lumen where they are hydrolyzed by acidic urine. Activation in the bladder could include peroxida tion by prostaglandin H synthetase (Flammang et et al. 1984c), oxidation by cytochrome P-450 (Butler et al. 1989), and by O-acetyltransferase (Frederickson et al. 1992), or N,O-acetyltransferase (Hatcher et al. 1992). N-Acetylbenzidine can be further hydroxylated before glucuroni dation. Dogs are nonacetylators, but their ability to form benzidine\u00ad N-glucuronide (Babu et al. 1992, 1993a) may contribute to the high incidence of bladder rather than liver cancer. The glucuronides of benzidine and N-acetetylbenzidine were found to be much more stable at pH 7.4 than 5.3 (Babu et al. 1992, 1995). The propo sed role of metabolism in benzidine-induced cancer in liver and urinary bladder is presented in Figure 3-5; this figure has been adapted from Babu et al. (1995). Regardless of the pathway involved, DNA adducts with N-acetylated benzidine derivatives have been observed in rodents and humans, principally th at of N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-N'-acetylbenzidine (Kennelly et al. 1984; Martin et al. 1982; Rothman et al. 1996a; Yamazoe et al. 1988). This DNA adduct is presumed to be formed by O-acetylation of N'-h ydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine and subsequent binding to a DNA base. As previously mentioned, acidic urine is thought to release the amine from the glucuronides; the amine can then be activated, for example, by prostaglandin H synthase to initiate carcinogenesis. The predominant reactive intermediate generated by pr ostaglandin H synthase and related peroxidases has been identified as benzidinediimine, and it reacts primarily with the C8 position of deoxyguanosine (Yamazoe et al. 1988). Lakshmi et al. (1994) suggested that at acid pH, benzidinediimine is in 69 Figure 3-5. The Proposed Role of Metabolism in Benzidine-Induced Cancer BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS ABZ = et al. (1995) 70 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS equilibrium with nitrenium ion, the species proposed to bind to bladder DNA. Furthermore, they showed that the in vitro formation of benzidinediimine could be pr evented by conjugation with glutathione to generate 3-(glutathion-S-yl)-benzidine. The forma tion of the conjugate was dependent upon diimine and not benzidine, suggesting that c onversion of benzidine to diimine occurs before formation of the conjugate. Susceptibility to bladder cancer has been linked to the slow acetylator type of the polymorphic NAT2 N-acetyltransferase gene (Blum et al. 1991; Ohsako and Deguchi 1990). A study of Chinese workers with high exposure to benzidine demonstrated a 100 -fold increased risk for bladder cancer (Bi et al. 1992). However, when members of the benzidine- exposed cohort were screened for their acetylator phenotype and genotype, no positive association was found between N-acetylation phenotype or genotype and bladder cancer risk (Hayes et al. 1993). The au thors suggested that the difference between their results and those of the previous investigators may be due to the fact that their subjects were only exposed to benzidine, while those in earlier studies were al so exposed to other aromatic amines (monoamines). This was consistent with the fact that N-acetylmonoamines undergo much less oxidation than the monoamine; therefore, for monoamines, acetylation is a detoxification reaction. In contrast, N-acetylbenzidine is relatively reactive and still susceptib le to N'-oxidation or N'-glucuronidation; thus, acetylation of benzidine is an activation process pot entially leading to bladder cancer. Further research conducted in recent years has shown that slow acetyl ators are not at increased risk for bladder cancer relative to fast acetylators (Lakshmi et al. 1995a; Rothman et al. 1996a; Zenser et al. 1996). These data are consistent with the observation that benzidine can be acetylated by NAT1 for which genotypic differences in acetylation rate have not been obser ved. NAT1 in humans may have a dominant role in acetylation of benzidine (Zenser et al. 1996). In addition, the deacylase could have a dominant effect on the profile of benzidine metabolites formed (Laksh mi et al.1995a). These studies are discussed in more detail in Section 3.10. The genotoxicity of benzidine is also mediated thr 1988; al. 1990; al. 1992); in vivo and in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis tests 1990; Steinmetz Sinsheimer et assays for micronucleus formation (Harper et al. 1989; Mirkova and 1988; Sanderson and Clark 1993; Tice et al. 1990); and in tests for sister chromatid exchanges (Lindahl-Kiessling et al. 1989). Benzidine metabolites also bind to protein and RNA (Kadlubar et al. 1986b; Lakshmi et al. 1990a; Zenser 71 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS et al. 1983), and hemoglobin (Birner et al. 1990; Zwirner-Baier and Neumann 1998), although specific toxicological responses are not yet attributable to these effects. When male mice were administered 86 ppm benzidine as benzidine dihydrochloride in drinking water for 1 year, 13 of 22 (59%) observed liver tumors were found to contain a mutation in codon 61 of the H- ras oncogene (Fox 1990). Although a sim ilar frequency of oncogene mutati ons were observed in sponta\u00ad neous liver tumors, much lower frequencies (7-21% ) were observed in tumors induced by several nongenotoxic agents. These results are consistent w ith genotoxicity being at least a component of benzidine's observed carcinogenicity. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be involved, however, as H- ras and K- ras oncogenes in benzidine-induced liver tumors were found to be hypomethylated in comparison to adjacent nontumor tissue (Vorce and Goodman 1989). Hypomethylation of a gene is thought to enhance its transcription, and thus, benzidine may be capable of facilitating aberrant expression of genes that are involved in carcinogenesis. 3.5.3 Animal-to-Human Extrapolations Relatively little information is available on noncancer e ffects of benzidine. Therefore, an attempt to discuss potential interspecies differences or similar ities in benzidine noncancer toxicity based on the limited information available is speculative at this time. Benzidine is a bladder carcinogen in humans and dogs, and primarily a liver carcinogen in rodents. The differences in target site are attributed to the species-specific metabolic pathways for activation of benzidine to a reactive intermediate. Extrapolation of carcinogenicity data for benzidine from any one an imal species to humans is inappropriate unless there is information suggesting that the particular animal species and humans share common metabolic pathways that produce similar carcinogenic chemical species. 3.6 ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION Recently, attention has focused on the potential hazar dous effects of certain chemicals on the endocrine system because of the ability of these chemicals to mimic or block endogenous hormones, or otherwise interfere with the normal function of the endocrine syst em. Chemicals with this type of activity are most commonly referred to as endocrine disruptors. Some scientists believe that chemicals with the ability to disrupt the endocrine system are a potential threat to the health of humans, aquatic animals, and wildlife. Others believe that endocrine disrupting chemicals do not pose a significant health risk, particularly in light of the fact that hormone mimics exist in the natural environment. Examples of natural hormone 72 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS mimics are the isoflavinoid phytoestrogens (Adlercreutz 1995; Livingston 1978; Mayr et al. 1992). These compounds are derived from plants and are similar in structure and action as endogenous estrogen. While there is some controversy over the public health significance of endocrine disrupting chemicals, it is agreed that the potential exists for these compounds to affect the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in th e body that are responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis, reproduction, developmen t, and/or behavior (EPA 1997). As a result, endocrine disruptors may play a role in the disruption of sexual functi on, immune suppression, and neurobehavioral function. Endocrine disruption is also thought to be involved in the induction of breast, testicular, and prostate cancers, as well as endometriosis (Berger 1994; Giwercman et al. 1993; Hoel et al. 1992). No studies were located regarding endocrine disruption in humans or animals after exposure to benzidine. 3.7 CHILDREN'S SUSCEPTIBILITY This section discusses potential health effects from exposures during the period from conception to maturity at 18 years of age in humans, when all biological systems will have fully developed. Potential effects on offspring resulting from exposures of parental germ cells are considered, as well as any indirect effects on the fetus and neonate resulting from mate rnal exposure during gestation and lactation. Relevant animal and in vitro models are also discussed. Children are not small adults. They differ from a dults in their exposures and may differ in their susceptibility to hazardous chemicals. Children's uni que physiology and behavior can influence the extent of their exposure. Exposures of children are discussed in Section 6.6 Exposures of Children. Children sometimes differ from adults in their susceptib ility to hazardous chemicals, but whether there is a difference depends on the chemical (Guzelian et al. 1992; NRC 1993). Children may be more or less susceptible than adults to health effects, and th e relationship may change with developmental age (Guzelian et al. 1992; NRC 1993). Vulnerability often depends on developmental stage. There are critical periods of structural and functional devel opment during both prenatal and postnatal life and a particular structure or function will be most sensitiv e to disruption during its critical period(s). Damage may not be evident until a later stage of developmen t. There are often differences in pharmacokinetics and metabolism between children and adults. For ex ample, absorption may be different in neonates because of the immaturity of their gastrointestinal tract and their larger skin surface area in proportion to body weight (Morselli et al. 1980; NRC 1993); the gastrointestinal absorption of lead is greatest in infants 73 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS and young children (Ziegler et al. 1978). Distribu tion of xenobiotics may be different; for example, infants have a larger proportion of their bodies as ex tracellular water and their brains and livers are proportionately larger (Altman and Dittmer 1974; Widdowson and Dickerson 1964). The infant also has an immature blood-brain barrier (Adinolfi 1985; Johanson 1980) and probably an immature blood-testis barrier (Setchell and Waites 1975). Many xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes have distinctive deve lopmental patterns. At various stages of growth and development, levels of particular enzymes ma y be higher or lower than those of adults, and sometimes unique enzymes may exist at particular developmental stages (Komori et al. 1990; Leeder and Kearns 1997; NRC 1993; Vieira et al. 1996). Whethe r differences in xenobiotic metabolism make the child more or less susceptible also depends on whethe r the relevant enzymes are involved in activation of the parent compound to its toxic form or in detoxifi cation. There may also be differences in excretion, particularly in newborns who all ha ve a low glomerular filtration rate and have not developed efficient tubular secretion and resorption capacities (Altman and Dittmer 1974; NRC 1993; West et al. 1948). Children and adults may differ in their capacity to repair damage from chemical insults. Children also have a longer remaining lifetime in which to express da mage from chemicals; this potential is particularly relevant to cancer. Certain characteristics of the developing human may increase exposure or susceptibility, whereas others may decrease susceptibility to the same chemical. For example, although infants breathe more air per kilogram of body weight than adults breathe, this di fference might be somewhat counterbalanced by their alveoli being less developed, which results in a disproportionately smaller surface area for alveolar absorption (NRC 1993). There are no studies that specifically addressed the hea lth effects of exposure to benzidine in children or immature animals; therefore, it is unknown whether children differ from adults in their susceptibility to health effects from benzidine. Data in adults ar e mostly derived from occupational studies and, despite the inherent limitations of this type of study, ther e is unequivocal evidence that benzidine is a bladder carcinogen in humans (Bi et al. 1992; Ferber et al . 1976; Goldwater et al. and El-Attar et al. 1990; Zavon al. 1973). There is also suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity at other tissue sites as well (Delzell et al. 1989; Morinaga et al. 1982; Okubo 1985; Piolatto et al. 1991; Wu 1988; Zavon et al. 1973). 74 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS The only information regarding possible adverse developmental effects in humans is that provided by a study by Wilkins and Sinks (1990) which suggest ed an association between parental exposure to benzidine and childhood brain tumors. However, resu lts and conclusions of this study are largely speculative due to lack of sufficient validation of the job exposure matrix used to estimate exposure levels. Also, a somewhat limited epidemiological study failed to detect any evidence of elevated rates for birth defects in residents living near a Superfund site contaminated with benzidine (Budnick et al. 1984). However, the extent of actual exposure (if any) to benzidine was not determined. There is considerable evidence that benzidine or its metabolites can be genotoxic, but it is unknown wh ether parental exposure could result in benzidine metabolites reaching parental germ cells, or whether this might affect childhood development or cancer incidence. There is no information regarding pharmacokinetics of benzidine in children nor it is known whether benzidine can be stored and excreted in breast milk . Although there have been no direct measurements to determine whether benzidine can cross the placenta, there is some indirect evidence that it or its meta\u00ad bolites do. The evidence is based on the results of a study in which intraperitoneal administration of benzidine to pregnant mice resulted in the induction of micronuclei in the liver of fetuses (Sanderson and Clark 1993); however, when pregnant mice were ora lly exposed to benzidine, there was no increase in micronucleated cells either in their livers or the liv ers of their fetuses (Harper et al. 1989). There is no information on whether benzidine can be stored in maternal tissues and be mobilized during pregnancy or lactation. There is no information on the metabolism of benzidin e in children. Analysis of urine and bile from humans exposed to benzidine revealed the presen ce of metabolites derived from phase I and phase enzymatic reactions (EPA 1980a, 1986c; Sciarini with N-acetylation. N-Acetylation in humans is likely done by one of two families of N-acetyltransferases. One of these families, NAT2, is developmentally regulated (Leeder and Kerns 1997). Some enzyme activity can be detected in the fe tus by the end of the first trimester. Almost all infants exhibit the slow acetylator phenotype between birth and 2 months of age. The adult phenotype distribution is reached by the age of 4-6 months, whereas adult activity is found by approximately 1-3 years of age. Results from earlier studies had suggested that humans possessing a slow acetylator phenotype may be at a higher risk for developing bl adder cancer (Hanke and Krajewska 1990). However, more recent data suggest that the acetylation rate ma y not be an important risk factor (Hayes et al. 1993; Rothman et al. 1996a). It was also shown that in humans, NAT1 rather than NAT2 plays a more important role in the acetylation of both benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine (Zenser et al. 1996). UGT also 75 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS contributes to benzidine metabolism and is known to vary developmentally as well (Leeder and Kearns 1997). Ontogeny is isozyme-specific and adult activity is reached at the age of 6-18 months. It is generally accepted that benzidine, like many ot her arylamines, requires metabolic activation by the cytochrome P-450 system in order to manifest genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. The expression of some P-450 enzymes does vary developmentally (Leeder a nd Kearns 1997). However, for benzidine, the precise cytochrome P-450 isozymes involved in its metabolism by humans are not known. There are no biomarkers of exposure or effect for be nzidine that have been validated in children or in adults exposed as children. No studies were located regarding interactions of benzidine with other chemicals in children or adults. No information was located regarding pediatric-sp ecific methods for reducing peak absorption following exposure to benzidine, reducing body burden, or interfering with the mechanism of action for toxic effects. In addition, no data were located rega rding whether methods for reducing toxic effects of benzidine in adults might be contraindicated in children. 3.8 BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE AND EFFECT Biomarkers are broadly defined as indicators signaling events in biologic systems or samples. They have been classified as markers of exposure, markers of effect, and markers of susceptibility (NAS/NRC 1989). Due to a nascent understanding of the use and interpre tation of biomarkers, implementation of biomarkers as tools of exposure in the general population is very limited. A biomarker of exposure is a xenobiotic substance or its metabolite(s) or the product of an interaction between a xenobiotic agent and some target molecule(s) or cell(s) that is measured within a compartment of an organism (NAS/NRC 1989). The preferred biomarkers of exposure are generally the substance itself or substance-specific metabolites in readily obtainable body fluid(s), or excreta. However, several factors can confound the use and interpretation of biomarkers of exposure. The body burden of a substance may be the result of exposures from more than one source. The substance being measured may be a metabolite of another xenobiotic substance (e.g., high urinary levels of phenol can result from exposure to several different aromatic compounds). Depending on the properties of the substance (e.g., biologic half-life) and environmental conditions (e.g., duration and route of exposure), the substance and all of its metabolites may have left the 76 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS body by the time samples can be taken. It may be difficult to identify individuals exposed to hazardous substances that are commonly found in body tissues and fluids (e.g., essential mineral nutrients such as copper, zinc, and selenium). Biomarkers of expos ure to benzidine are discussed in Section 3.8.1. Biomarkers of effect are defined as any measurable bi ochemical, physiologic, or other alteration within an organism that, depending on magnitude, can be recognized as an established or potential health impairment or disease (NAS/NRC 1989). This definition encompasses biochemical or cellular signals of tissue dysfunction (e.g., increased liver enzyme activity or pathologic changes in female genital epithelial cells), as well as physiologic signs of dysfunction such as increased blood pressure or decreased lung capacity. Note that these markers are not often substance specific. They also may not be directly adverse, but can indicate potential health impairment (e.g., DNA adducts). Biomarkers of effects caused by benzidine are discussed in Section 3.8.2. A biomarker of susceptibility is an indicator of an i nherent or acquired limitation of an organism's ability to respond to the challenge of exposure to a specific xenobiotic substance. It can be an intrinsic genetic or other characteristic or a preexisting disease that r esults in an increase in absorbed dose, a decrease in the biologically effective dose, or a target tissue res ponse. If biomarkers of susceptibility exist, they are discussed in Section 3.10 \"Populations That Are Unusually Susceptible\". 3.8.1 Biomarkers Used to Identify or Quantify Exposure to Benzidine As indicated by a number of studies previously discussed in Section 3.4.3 (Meigs et al. 1951, 1954; Sciarini and Meigs 1961), a variety of benzidine co mpounds can be detected in the urine of humans exposed to benzidine or benzidine-based dyes. These glucuronic acid conjugates of these compounds. For example, Dewan et al. (1988) used a high performance liquid chromatography instrument equipped with an absorbance detector to monitor benzidine and its mono- and diacetylated derivatives in the urine of workers exposed at a dye-manufacturing facility. Detection limits were 0.25 \u00b5g/L for the former two compounds, and 0.5 \u00b5g/L for the latter. These biomarke rs are specific for benzidine or benzidine-derived compounds, and can be confidently identified with the use of appropriate standards, especially in situations where exposure to such compounds seems reasonable. Although there are no background levels of such biomarker compounds, their urinary le vels are likely to fall below detection limits within several days to 2 weeks due to relatively short biological half-lives. 77 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS With respect to biomarkers that can indicate or quantify exposure, covalent binding of benzidine and some of its congeners to hemoglobin has been dem onstrated as a promising approach (Birner et al. 1990; Neumann 1988; Zwirner-Baier and Neumann 1998). After oral treatment of rats with 142 mg/kg of benzidine, hemoglobin adducts were hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions, extracted, and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector (Birner et al. 1990). The method is based on the cleavage of sulfinic acid amides formed in vivo with hemoglobin by the reaction of metabolically generated nitrosoa renes and the SH-group products were (the major component), benzidine itself, and 4-amino\u00ad biphenyl (suggesting the occurrence of a previously unknown metabolic pathway for benzidine). The authors proposed using the analysis of hemoglobin adducts in human blood to monitor for exposure to carcinogenic compounds such as benzidine. The sam e cleavage products (benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine, and 4-aminobiphenyl) were found in a ratio of 1:17:1 in a more recent study by the oral route in rats (Zwirner-Baier and Neumann 1998). Adducts of benzidine and its metabolites with DNA can also be an extremely sensitive biomarker for detecting and quantifying exposure (Levy and We ber 1988). Hepatic DNA was isolated from mice injected intraperitoneally with 90 mg/kg of benzidine, hydrolyzed, and then solvent-treated to enhance nucleo tide-benzidine adducts. 32P postlabelling, these high performance liquid chromatography. The major benzidine adduct appeared to be acetylated. This method detected adducts after as little as 3 hours of exposure, and required less than 1 \u00b5g of mouse hepatic DNA. A similar approach has detected attomoles (10-18 moles) of benzidine-DNA adduct in human peripheral lymphocytes exposed in vitro to benzidine (Gupta et al. 1988). The use of standards and controls ar e important to this methodology of DNA adduct characterization, which is extremely sensitive and relatively rapid. Benzidine-DNA adducts have also been found in vivo in peripheral white blood cells (WBC) and exfoliated urothelial cells of workers occupationally exposed to benzidine (Rothman et al. 1996a; Zhou et al. 1997). The most predominant adduct (N-acetylated) co-chromatographed with a synthetic N-(3'-phosphodeoxyguanosin-8-yl)\u00ad N'-acetylbenzidine standard; the median level (range) of this adduct in WBC DNA was 194.4 (3.2-975) RAL (relative adduct labeling) x 10 9 in exposed workers and 1.4 (0.1-6.4) in the control subjects. There was a striking correlation between levels of this DNA adduct in WBCs and exfoliated urothelial cells; additionally, benzid ine, N-acetylbenzidine, and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine correlated with the levels of the major DNA adduc t found in both WBCs and exfoliated urothelial cells (Zhou et al. 1997). A recent study reported that the mutagenicity of urine from workers to Salmonella strain YG1024 was exposure related (DeMarini et al . 1997). That is, the mean urinary mutagenicity 78 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS (revertants/\u00b5mol creatinine) of unexposed controls w as 2.8 compared to 8.2 in low-exposure workers and 123 in high-exposure workers. In addition, urinar y mutagenicity showed a strong positive correlation with benzidine urinary metabolites and the level of the presumptive urothelial DNA adduct. Adducts of benzidine with either hemoglobin or DNA are specific fo r exposure to benzidine or to any substance that, as a result of biotransformation in the body, may give origin to benzidine. The possibility that mutations in specific genes can be used as biomarkers of exposure (and/or effect) to benzidine (and other arylamines) has also been exam ined. For example, Taylor et al. (1996) compared the frequency and pattern of p53 (a well-known tumor suppressor gene) mutations in 34 bladder tumors from American workers with past high-level occupational exposure to arylamines to those in 30 bladder tumors from people without such exposure. Thei r analysis revealed no differences for p53 mutations between the two groups suggesting that exposure to arylamines does not leave a mutational \"footprint\" in the p53 gene. In contrast, Yasunaga et al. (1997) found that bladder lesions from 26 Japanese workers occupationally exposed to aromatic amines exhi bited different patterns of p53 mutations from nonoccupational bladder lesions. Cytosine to thymidine transitions were the most common mutations. The reason for this discrepancy is not apparent. The results of Yasunaga et al. (1997) also suggested that the multifocality noted in most occupational bladder cancer arises both from multiple clonal lesions and from the dissemination of a single clone. Sorlie et al. (1998) analyzed the pattern of mutations in four genes (p53, p16 MTS1, p21WAF1, and H- ras) in 21 cases of bladder cancer among western European workers exposed to aromatic amines and found that only p53 had a high frequency of mutations. The spectrum of mutations found was highly suggestive of an involve ment of exogenous carcinogens and was identical to the spectrum of p53 mutations detected in bladder cancers of the general population. In the exposed workers, p53 mutations were associated with tu mor grade and with high occupational and tobacco exposure. The data further suggested that the sam e carcinogens may be responsible for the development of bladder cancer in workers exposed to aromatic amines and in the general population. An additional study of workers exposed to 2-naphthylamine and benzidine reported over expression of the ras oncogene in bladder biopsies relative to unexposed cancer patient s, patients with benign conditions of the bladder, and healthy subjects (Novara et al. 1996). c-erB-2 (an oncogene whose expression is associated with invasiveness and prognosis) was over expressed in both unexposed and exposed bladder cancer cases and, therefore, was not associated with occupational exposure. 79 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.8.2 Biomarkers Used to Characterize Effects Caused by Benzidine Early studies (Meigs et al. 1986; Vigliani and Ba rsotti 1962; Zavon et al. 1973) used bloody urine and cytoscopy as a biomarker for observation of bladder carcinomas. More recent studies have focused on the binding of benzidine's activated metabolites to cellular macromolecules. As discussed in the previous section, hemoglobin and DNA adducts derived from benzidine and its me tabolites have been identified and quantified in cells of the blood and liver. Fo llowing intravenous administration of radiolabeled benzidine in dogs, significant amounts of DNA binding we re observed in the liver, kidney, and bladder (Lakshmi et al. 1990a). The highest concentrati on of binding was found in the bladder transitional epithelium, the principal target tissue for benzidine's carcinogenic action in this species. DNA adducts were also identified and quantified in bladder epithelial and liver tissues of dogs exposed orally to benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine (Beland et al. 1983). Arylamine substitution at the C8 position of deoxyguanosine was the dominant adduct, and the level of adduct formation correlated with the bacterial mutagenicity of these compounds. As evidence of genotoxicity, human exposure to benz idine and benzidine-based dyes has been shown to induce chromosomal and in circulating peripheral lymphocytes (Mirkova and Lalchev 1990). Mutagenicity has also been detected in the urine and bile of rodents treated with benzidine (Bos et al. 1980, 1981; Chipman and M ohn 1989). The formation of nuclear anomalies (micronuclei, pyknotic, and karyorrh ectic nuclei) in intestinal epith elial cells of rats treated with benzidine is consistent with its in testinal carcinogenic effect in this species (Percy et al. 1989), as is the induction of DNA repair synthesis in explanted rabb it bladder tissue exposed to benzidine (McQueen et al. 1987). However, these and other manifestations of benzidine's genotoxicity are not specific to benzidine or even arylamine exposure. The liver cytosol activity of arylsulfotransferase was found to be reduced in rats treated with 120 ppm of benzidine in drinking water (approximately 0.26 mg /kg/day) (Ringer and Norton 1988). In rats, this pattern may be characteristic of, though not uni que to, liver carcinogens which can utilize the arylsulfotransferase pathway for bioactivation. It s sensitivity, relative specificity, and relevance as a human biomarker are not currently known. The same uncertainties exist for extrapolation to humans of most of the other toxic effects noted in animals. In humans, detection and examination of exfoliated bladder cells by urine cytology may be useful in detecting bladder cancer (Crosby et al. 1991; Mason et al. 1986; Tsuchiya et al. 1975). Although relevant 80 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS to benzidine's principal toxicological effect of concern in humans, this biomarker would not be specific to benzidine exposure. It has been reported that bladder cancer patients who have been exposed to benzidine are at increased risk of developing multiple primary tumors at other sites in comparison with nonexposed bladder cancer patients (Morinaga et al. 1982; Okubo et al. 1985). This clinical presentation might suggest that a possible benzidine exposure has taken place. Tanigawa et al. (1990) observed an unusual and persistent natural k iller cell activity pattern toward a target human cancer cell line in individuals who had been exposed to benzidine or -naphthylamine. Although overall activity was apparently normal, the unusual natural killer cell pattern was achieved by an increase in the number of circulating natural k iller cells, each of which possessed a lower than normal per cell activity. This effect was observed even 20 years after exposure, and the mechanisms are currently unknown. Should this observation be confirme d and verified as a benzidine effect, investigation of its scientific basis, reproducibility, and specificity might allow for its development as a sensitive biomarker. This study also reported an increased proportion of Leu11a-(CD-16) positive circulating peripheral lymphocytes in workers exposed to benzidine or -naphthylamine. A follow-up study (Araki et al. 1993) reported that the total and relative numbers of T lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4+ and CD3+) in the high-exposure group were significantly lo wer than those found in the control group. The authors concluded that measurement of CD4+ lymphocytes provides a useful biological marker of past exposure to aromatic amines, including benzidine. The more recent studies of Sung et al. (1995) and Tanigawa et al. (1996) also found changes in th e numbers of T lymphocyte subpopulations in high- exposure groups of dye workers exposed to aromatic am ines. Tanigawa et al. (1996) suggested that the observed changes in T lymphocytes resemble those noted in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Additional information concerning biomarkers for e ffects on the immune, renal, and hepatic systems can be found in the CDC/ATSDR Subcommittee Report on Biological Indicators of Organ Damage (CDC/ATSDR 1990), and on the neurological system in the Office of Technology Assessment Report on Identifying and Controlling Poisons of the Nervous System (OTA 1990). A more detailed discussion of the health effects caused by benzidine can be found in Section 3.2. 81 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.9 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER CHEMICALS No specific quantitative data on the interaction of benz idine with other chemicals were located. However, it is reasonable to assume that the combined effect of the carcinogenic arylamines that impact the same target organs would be at least as great as the additive effect of their individual exposures. Data from at least one retrospective epidemiology study provide s upport for this hypothesis (Goldwater et al. 1965). It was reported that 21% of workers exposed to benzidine between 1912 a nd 1962 developed bladder cancer, while the rate was 46% for those exposed to both benzidine and another known bladder carcinogen, -naphthylamine. The significance of these findings regarding a possible synergistic effect between the two chemicals cannot be evaluated b ecause neither the levels of exposure nor the dose- response relationships could be adequately determined. Rat studies on the chlorinated benzidine analog 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine suggest that concurrent or sequential exposure with other know n bladder carcinogens results in at least an additive carcinogenic effect (Tatematsu et al. 1977; Tsuda et al. 1977). Th e relevance to benzidine of these findings is unclear because differences in metabolism between the two chemicals have been reported. Though not universally found, synergistically elevated rates of bladder cancer in workers exposed to benzidine who also smoked were reported in several epidemiology studies (Bi et al. 1992; Wu 1988; Xue- Yun et al. 1990). These findings suggest interactions between benzidine and the carcinogenic or enzyme- inducing compounds found in cigarette smoke. It is also possible that alcohol might potentiate the toxicity of benzidine, probably by altering its metabolism. Exposing rats to 15% (v/v) ethanol in drinking water for 6 weeks resulted in increased cytochrome P-450 content and enhanced N-acetylation capacity of isolated hepatocytes (Neis et al. 1985a). Further, relative to the mutagenicity meditated by control hepatocytes, the in vitro mutagenicity of benzidine to bacteria was increased following meta bolic activation by hepatocytes isolated from the ethanol-treated rats. Again, the relevance of these findings to humans is unclear, given that the bladder appears to be the principal human target orga n, and that noncytochrome P-450 pathways may be significant in the human metabolism of benzidine. Finally, as discussed in Section 3.11.3, various pharmaceutical compounds may influence the toxicity of benzidine, either by affecting its metabolism or by interacting with its reactive metabolites. 82 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.10 POPULATIONS THAT ARE UNUSUALLY SUSCEPTIBLE A susceptible population will exhibit a different or enha nced response to benzidine than will most persons exposed to the same level of benzidine in the envi ronment. Reasons may include genetic makeup, age, health and nutritional status, and exposure to other toxic substan ces (e.g., cigarette smoke). These parameters result in reduced detoxification or excre tion of benzidine, or compromised function of organs affected by benzidine. Populations who are at greater risk due to their unusually high exposure to benzidine are discussed in Section 6.7, Populations With Potentially High Exposures. Evidence suggesting that N-acetylation plays a key role in the metabolism and toxicity of benzidine has been previously addressed (Section 3.4.3), and the possibility of genetic polymorphism for acetylation capacity and cancer susceptibility to certain drugs a nd chemicals has recently been evaluated (Brown 1988). During the 1950s and 1960s, it was demonstrated that differential sensitivity to drugs such as isoniazid and sulfamethazine were based on a Mende lian distribution in the population of two genetic alleles for N-acetyltransferase, with the allele responsible for low acetyltransferase activity being recessive to that for high enzyme activity. In the United States, it has been estimated that approximately 50% of the population is homozygous for the slow a llele, 40% heterozygous for the two alleles, and 8% homozygous for the fast allele (Brown 1988). This equates to phenotypic population of slow and fast acetylators (possibly also very fast acetylators\u2014tho se homozygous for the fast allele). The relative proportions of these subpopulations can vary w ith ethnic origin and geographical location. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular basis of the human N-acetylation polymorphism through gene cloning and sequencing (Blum et al. 1991; Ohsako and Deguchi 1990). At least three mutant alleles with specific DNA base-substitutions have been isolated, and they appear to account for the vast majority of slow acetylator phenotypes. Two of the alleles seem to cause a decrease in amount of the NAT2 isozyme of N-acetyltransferase (probably by de fective translation of the RNA message), whereas the third produces an unstable enzyme. Based on these findings, a simple DNA amplification assay was developed which appears to allow the predictive ge notyping of more than 95% of the slow and fast acetylator alleles (Blum et al. 1991). Since the early drug work, other chemicals, includi ng benzidine, have been found to be differentially acetylated in humans (and rabbits), apparently by the same N-acetyltransferase involved in isoniazid and sulfamethazine metabolism (Glowinski et al. 1978; Pe ters et al. 1990). As suggested by the metabolism data previously discussed and as noted by Brow n (1988), N-acetylation appears to contribute to 83 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS benzidine's carcinogenic activation in the liver (e.g., rodents) but not in the bladder (e.g., rabbits, dogs), where it seems more likely to be involved in deactiv ation and elimination. Several studies in humans suggested that the slow acetylator phenotype significantly enhanced the risk of arylamine-induced bladder et Mommsen and Aagaard 1986). However, more r ecent data indicate that the acetylation rate may not be as important as previously thought (Hayes et al. 1993; Lakshmi et al. 1995b; Rothman et al. 1996a; Zenser et al. 1996). For example, Lakshmi et al. (1995a) showed that human liver slices from individuals with the rapid NAT2 genotype formed only 1.4-fold more N-acetylbenzidine than slow acetylators; this difference was not significant. They also found no apparent correlation between NAT2 genotype and N-acetylbenzidine or N,N'-diacetylbenzidine with paraoxon, deacetylase inhibitor, no difference in yield of N,N' -diacetylbenzidine was seen between slow and fast acetylators, suggesting that a second acetylation pathwa y may be involved in the human liver. Additional studies by the same group of investigators showed that both benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine are preferred substrates for NAT1 (Zenser et al. 1996). In a study of benzidine-exposed workers in India, almost all benzidine-related metabolites in the urine were acetylated among slow, as well as rapid acetylators, and NAT2 activity did not affect the levels of any DNA adduct measured (Rothman et al. 1996a). These findings suggested that it is unlikely that interindividual variation in NAT2 function is relevant for benzidine-associated bladder carci nogenesis (Rothman et al. 1996a). A study of 196 urothelial cancer patients in an area with ear lier benzidine production in Germany also found no increased prevalence of slow acetylators in comparis on with the general (unexposed) population (Golka et al. 1996) (see Section 3.5.2 for further discussion on acetylator type and bladder cancer risk). In the same cohort evaluated by Rothman et al. (1996a), Rothman et al. (1997) evaluated the influence of urine pH on the proportion of urinary benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine present in the free, unconjugated state and on exfoliated urothelial cell DNA adducts. Th e authors found that post-workshift urine pH was inversely correlated with the proportions of benz idine and N-acetylbenzidine present as free compounds. They also noticed that the average of each subject's pre- and post-workshift urine pH was negatively associated with the predominant urothelial DNA a dduct. These observations are consistent with in vitro studies of human (Babu et al. 1994a) and dog liver (Babu et al. 1992) preparations in which the glucuronides of benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine, and N'-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine became unstable (releasing a potential active intermediate) as urine pH was decreased from 7.4 to 5.5. The potential implication of this observation is that benzidin e-exposed workers or individuals from the general population who smoke and consume foods that contribute to urine acidification (cheese, meat, fish, and grains) may be at a higher risk for bladder cancer. 84 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS A deficiency of the glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) gene has been associated with bladder cancer in the general population in a number of studies (Bell et al. 1993; Brockm\u00f6ller et al. 1996; Daly et al. 1993); however, other studies found no association between this gene deficiency and the incidence of bladder cancer (Lin et al. 1994; Zhong et al. 1993). In a recent case-control study (38 bladder cancer cases, 43 controls) of workers in China previously exposed to benzidine, the GSTM1-null genotype was not associated with increased risk of bladder can cer, although \"highly exposed\" workers with the null genotype exhibited a nonsignificantly greater risk of bladder cancer compared to similarly exposed workers without this allele (Rothman et al. 1996b) . The GSTM1 genotype had impact on urothelial cell DNA adduct and urinary mutagenicity levels in workers exposed to benzidine at the time of the study; additionally, human GSTM1 did not conjugate be nzidine or its metabolites. Shinka et al. (1998) found no significant association between urothelial can cer patients and GSTM1 gene deficiency among 137 workers who had prior exposure to dyestuff in termediates, 36 of whom had urothelial cancer. However, in a multiple logistic analysis of the contributions of both GSTM1 gene polymorphism and occupational environmental factors, a \"strong trend\" toward development of urothelial cancer was noted. As previously discussed, there is epidemiological evidence to suggest that people who smoke or are exposed to other arylamine carcinogens are likely to be at increased risk for benzidine-induced cancer (Goldwater et al. 1965). There is also laboratory evidence based on rats that indicates that significant alcohol consumption could increase susceptibility to benzid ine toxicity (Neis et al. 1985a). Likewise, it is possible that populations having a diet high in meat and fat, and low in grain and fiber, might experience some excess risk due to resultant effects on benzidine metabolism by intestinal microflora (Gorbach and Goldin 1990; Levine 1991) (see Section 3.11.3). 3.11 METHODS FOR REDUCING TOXIC EFFECTS This section will describe clinical practice and resear ch concerning methods for reducing toxic effects of exposure to benzidine. However, because some of the treatments discussed may be experimental and unproven, this section should not be used as a guide for treatment of exposures to benzidine. When specific exposures have occurred, poison control cente rs and medical toxicologists should be consulted for medical advice. No texts were found that provided specific informa tion about treatment following exposures to benzidine. 85 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.11.1 Reducing Peak Absorption Following Exposure No data were located regarding methods for reduci ng absorption after inhalation exposure to benzidine. Following oral exposure, there are several methods by which the removal of benzidine from the gastrointestinal tract may be facilitated. Induced emesis, gastric lavage, use of saline cathartics, or activated charcoal are all common methods used to diminish the gastrointestinal absorption of compounds such as benzidine S ittig 1991; Stutz and Janusz 1988). In general, these treatments are most effective when used within a few hours after exposure. In some cases, these treatments may be contraindicated. For example, some authors contend that emesis should not be induced (Bronstein and Currance 1988), possibly due to risk of the chemical's aspiration into the lungs. In addition, emesis is definitely contraindicated in obt unded, comatose, or convulsing patients. Oils should not be used as a cathartic, as they may enhance the gastrointestinal absorption of benzidine. Saline cathartics should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function. Several methods exist for reducing absorption following dermal or ocular exposure to benzidine. All contaminated clothing should be removed, and contact ed skin should be immediately washed with soap and water (Bronstein and to facilitate eye irrigation (Bronstein and Currance 1988) , which should be initiated immediately. 3.11.2 Reducing Body Burden Activated charcoal is sometimes admi nistered in serial doses to minimize the enterohepatic recirculation of persistent chemicals. Studies in humans and animals indicate that benzidine is cleared from the body fairly rapidly, most of which appears in the urine (Meigs et al. 1951, 1954). Although it has not been studied in humans, animal data suggest that enterohe patic circulation may be i nvolved in the persistence and further metabolism of benzidine and its meta bolites (Chipman and Mohn 1989). Relatively prompt administration of activated charcoal may, therefore, be of benefit. 86 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.11.3 Interfering with the Mechanism of Action for Toxic Effects Benzidine must undergo metabolic activation to produ ce its deleterious effects, probably through binding of oxidized reactive intermediates to nucleic acid (DNA, RNA) and protein target molecules. Currently, there is little that can be done to alter the progressi on of toxicological events once binding of reactive intermediates to target molecules has occurred. Therefore, interfering with the metabolic activation of benzidine and the activity of its reactive in termediates seems a more promising approach. The only reports specifically addressing the inte rruption of benzidine metabolism focus on the prostaglandin H synthase activation pathway (Lakshmi et al. 1990b; Zenser and Davis 1990; Zenser et al. 1983), a pathway speculated to be of significance particularly for bladder and other nonhepatic carcinogenesis. These authors note that tissue level of peroxide is an important determinant of prostaglandin hydroperoxidase activity, and that cat alase and glutathione peroxidase are the principal enzymes responsible for maintaining low levels of hydrogen peroxide and fatty acid hydroperoxides, respectively. Therefore, any actions capable of enhancing the activities of these enzymes might be of some value in inhibiting prostaglandin H synthase's cooxidation of benzidine. Tissue content of arachidonic acid, a substrate of prostaglandin H synthase, is normally very low, and steps to minimize its release from phospholipids after hormonal, neuronal, or mechanical stimuli would also be of theoretical value. A specific inhibitor of the peroxidatic activity of prostaglandin H synthase is not currently available, but thioureylene drugs (propylthiouracil, methimazole) have been used to competitively inhibit the activity of thyroid peroxidase. Prostaglandin H synthase, however, is capable of generating its own peroxide substrate through its cyclooxygenase activity. Inhib ition of this cyclooxygenase by nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs such as aspirin can result in re duced prostaglandin hydroperoxidase activity, if the endogenous tissue content of peroxide is sufficiently low. In this respect, supplemental treatment with antioxidants might prove beneficial. Zenser and his colleagues (Zenser and Davis 1990; Zenser et al. 1983) further propose the following model of benzidine activation in wh ich prostaglandin H synthase activity itself may be inhibited at any one of several steps. First, generation of peroxide cosubstrate by the enzyme's own cyclooxygenase could be inhibited with aspirin or indomethacin. In some cases, peroxide formation from sources other than fatty acids might also be minimized (i.e., inhi bition of lipoxygenase activity with phenidone under conditions of high peroxide tone). 87 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Second, the actual prostaglandin hydroperoxidase-cat alyzed activation of benzidine would likely be interrupted by competitive substrates for the enzyme . These might also compete with benzidine for possible interaction with other enzyme-generated oxidants which have been proposed to oxidize cosubstrates such as benzidine by chemical r eaction. Such competitive inhibitors include propylthiouracil, phenidone, methimazole, and MK447. Third, the oxidized reactive intermediates (e.g., benz idinediimine) could be reduced back to the parent compounds (e.g., benzidine) by reducing agents such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Antioxidants (such as ethoxyquin and butylated hydroxytoluene) have been shown to inhibit the carcinogenicity of a number of compounds presumed to be activated by the cytochro me P-450 system, but may also be postulated to act at either the second or third steps just noted in the proposed prostaglandin H synthase pathway. Finally, benzidine and its oxidized reactive interm ediate, benzidinediimine, may by conjugation with molecules such as glutathione. Zenser et al. (1983) point out that only intervention via this latter step results in the actual elimination of benzidine, whereas steps 1-3 simply prevent the formation of, or reduce the amount of, already existing activated intermediates. Also, the inhibition of the fatty acid cyclooxygenase activity in step 1 has the potential disadvantage of altering physiologically important prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Evidence supporting the possible efficacy of such intervention was found in a study by Zenser et al. (1983). When expressed as a percentage of control values, the levels of benzidine's prostaglandin H synthase-catalyzed in vitro binding to microsomal protein were significantly (p<0.05) lower after treatment with most of the above compounds in the presence mmol using arachidonic acid, or 1% at 1 mmol using hydrogen peroxide). Only indomethacin in the presence of hydrogen peroxide cosubstrate was found ineffective. Similarly, several of the compounds were demonstrated to substantially reduce the prostaglandin H synthase-mediated in vitro binding of benzidine to DNA in the presence of arachidonic acid; values expressed as a percen tage of aspirin (4%), and therefore seems possible that pharmacological in tervention following benzidine exposure might be of value in mitigating deleterious effects, especially as the antioxidant, reducing, and conjugating types of 88 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS compounds discussed above would be expected to also be of value for metabolic activation catalyzed by other enzymes (cytochrome P-450, flavin monooxygenases, and lipoxygenases). As discussed in a number of review articles (e .g., Gorbach and Goldin 1990; Levine 1991), and as suggested by some of the bacterial acetyltransferase studies referred to previously (Section 3.4.3), microflora of the gastrointestinal tract may also play a significant role in the metabolic activation of benzidine. Microbial enzymes relevant to the gene ration of benzidine from certain azo dyes, or to its subsequent metabolism, include azoreductases, -glucuronidases, and acetyltransferases. It is possible that a diet high in grain and fiber and low in m eat and fat could contribute to lower risk following benzidine or benzidine-based azo dye exposure by lo wering levels of the first two types of enzymes (Gorbach and Goldin 1990). 3.12 ADEQUACY OF THE DATABASE Section 104(i)(5) of CERCLA, as amended, directs the Administrator of ATSDR (in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and agencies and programs of the Public Health Service) to assess whether adequate information on the health effects of benzidine is available. Where adequate information is not available, ATSDR, in conjunction with the National Toxicology Program (NTP), is required to assure the initiation of a program of research designed to determ ine the health effects (and techniques for developing methods to determine such health effects) of benzidine. The following categories of possible data needs have been identified by a joint team of scientists from ATSDR, NTP, and EPA. They are defined as substance-specific informational needs that if met would reduce the uncertainties of human health assessment. This definition should not be interpreted to mean that all data needs discussed in this section must be f illed. In the future, the identified data needs will be evaluated and prioritized, and a substance- specific research agenda will be proposed. 89 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.12.1 Existing Information on Health Effects of Benzidine The existing data on health effects of inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure of humans and animals to benzidine are summarized in Figure 3-6. The purpo se of this figure is to illustrate the existing information concerning the health effects of benzidine. Each dot in the figure indicates that one or more studies provide information associated with that pa rticular effect. The dot does not necessarily imply anything about the quality of the study or studies, nor should missing information in this figure be interpreted as a \"data need\". A data need, as defined in ATSDR's Decision Guide for Identifying Substance-Specific Data Needs Related to Toxicological Profiles (ATSDR 1989), is substance-specific information necessary to conduct comprehensive public health assessments. Generally, ATSDR defines a data gap more broadly as any substance-specific information missing from the scientific literature. As shown in Figure 3-6, no human data exist on the leth ality of benzidine (other than death by cancer) for any route of exposure. With the exception of two studies on the acute and chronic effects of dermal exposure, no information was located regarding the sy stemic effects in humans of benzidine exposure by any route or for any duration. Four studies were located regarding immunologic effects and a study of genotoxic effects in occupational settings where inhala tion is assumed to be the main route of exposure. A single study addressed developmental effects and po ssible environmental (principally oral) exposure to benzidine. Otherwise, no information was located regarding neurologic or reproductive effects after any route of exposure, or regarding developmental effect s after inhalation or dermal exposure. A single study addressed developmental and cancer effects in reside nts living near a benzidine-contaminated Superfund site, where the principal route of exposure is presumed to have been oral. Many epidemiological studies were located regarding cancer effects, all of whic h explicitly or implicitly involved inhalation and/or dermal exposure. For animals, no information was found regarding any toxic effect after dermal exposure. With the exception of a single rat cancer study, there was a similar lack of data regarding toxic effects after inhalation exposure. For the oral route of exposure, data were located regarding death, intermediate- and chronic-duration systemic effects, and immunologic, neurologic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic effects in animals. However, no information was found regardi ng acute-duration systemic effects or developmental effects in animals after oral exposure to benzidine. 90 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 91 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.12.2 Identification of Data Needs Acute-Duration Exposure. Only one study was located regarding the acute systemic effects of benzidine in humans. Severe recurrent eczematous dermatitis was reported in one individual following dermal exposure to benzidine in a clinical la boratory setting (Baer 1945). In animals, oral LD50 values have been reported for rats and mice (DOT 1972). Ve ry early work provides some data as to the oral doses which can lead to death in rabbits and dogs (A dler 1908), but these studies lack experimental detail and information on benzidine purity and chemical form. Potential immunotoxicity was indicated in one recent acute-duration oral mouse study where exposur e to a nonspecified dose of benzidine was reported to cause a delayed hypersensitivity response, alte red lymphocyte blastogenesis and natural killer cell activity, and an altered spleen/body weight ratio (Lus ter et al. 1992). No other acute studies in animals were located. The information with respect to both target organ identificati on and levels of exposure necessary to cause acute toxic effects is insufficient to derive acute- duration inhalation or oral MRLs. Because exposure to benzidine at hazardous waste sites is most likely to be by ingestion, emphasis should be placed on studies that examine effects following oral exposure, preferably studies that could be utilized to derive an acute oral MRL for benzidine. While an acute inhalation MRL for benzidine is also lacking, additional inhalation studies are not considered a pr iority as exposure at hazardous waste sites is less likely to be by the inhalation route. Likewise, additional acute dermal studies are not considered a priority due to the unlikelihood of significant dermal exposures to benzidine at hazardous waste sites as well as the predicted relatively poor bioavailability from soil based on its strong attachment to soil. Pharmacokinetics data are available in va rious animal species as well as in humans. Intermediate-Duration Exposure. No studies were located regarding systemic effects in humans after inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure to benzidin e. In animals, there are some oral intermediate- duration data which describe cardiovascular, hepa tic, and renal (DePass and Morris, 1981; hematological (Nelson 1971), or weight-loss effects (DePass and Morris 1981; Schieferstein 1982). However, these data are too limited to allow for the identification of the critical target organs or th e NOAEL or LOAEL values for intermediate-duration oral exposure, and therefore, are inadequate for derivation of an oral MRL. Data for the inhalation and dermal routes of exposure were not located. Additional oral intermediate-duration studies that identify target organs and provide quantitativ e data on the threshold for specific toxi c effects are needed in mice or rats, rabbits, and dogs. Toxicokinetic and cancer data are known for these species and for humans, which allows for easier extrapolation of any observed intermediate-duration effects to humans. Oral exposure via contaminated media is thought to be the potential main route of exposure to benzidine at or near waste 92 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS sites. Therefore, additional oral studies in anim als involving a range of exposure concentrations and employing sensitive histological and biochemical measurements of injury to a comprehensive set of organs or systems are needed to establish dose-res ponse relationships and identify thresholds for these effects. Special emphasis should be placed on reproductive organ pathology since, as discussed below, information on reproductive effects is lacking. Although ATSDR considers skin contact with contaminated soil a source of potential exposure to benz idine at hazardous waste sites, at this time, only oral studies are given priority consideration. This is because no experimental data were located regarding the bioavailability of benzidine attached to soil partic les. However, benzidine is a weak base that can be irreversibly bound to soil matrices, thus limiting its potential bioavailability from soil surfaces. Inhalation data needs are not assigned priority because inhalation is not considered to be a primary exposure route at hazardous waste sites. No intermediate-duration pha rmacokinetics data were located, but a need for such data is not apparent at this time. Chronic-Duration Exposure and Cancer. No studies were located regarding systemic effects in humans after inhalation or oral exposure to benzidine for chronic durations. Dermal sensitization to benzidine was detected in 231 (5%) of 4,600 patient s tested over a 5-year period; of these, 208 (89%) were clinically diagnosed as suffering from occ upational contact dermatitis (Grimalt and Romaguera 1981). No studies were located regarding systemic effects in animals after chronic inhalation or dermal exposure to benzidine, so no inha lation MRLs could be calculated. Several studies provided data on chronic-duration oral effects in animals, but, as detaile d below, were considered inadequate for derivation of a chronic oral MRL. Brain vacuolization, a ser ious effect, was seen in mice exposed to approximately 1.8 mg/kg/day, the lowest dose tested in the Littlefield et al. (1983) study. Weight loss (Schieferstein 1982), liver foci\u2014which may represent preneoplastic lesions (Frith et al. 1980), hemosiderin of the spleen, and bile duct hyperplasi a (Littlefield et al. 1983) have been reported in mice after chronic-duration oral exposure to benzidine doses between approximately 2.5 and 11 mg/kg/day. A marginally significant (p<0.10) increase in protein aceous kidney casts in female mice was reported, but not the specific dose at which the effect was observe d (Nelson et al. 1982). Liver cirrhosis was observed in several rabbits orally exposed for up to 3.5 y ears (Bonser 1959); however, only a summary of the data was presented. Recurring renal cystitis was the only treatment-related systemic effect observed in seven dogs exposed for 5 years (Spitz et al. 1950), but incomplete reporting of the results precluded establishing with certainty the dose level at which this effect occurred. Future epidemiological studies of exposed workers investigating such noncancer end poi nts rather than focusing only on cancer are needed, as are additional noncancer chronic-duration studies in animals, although data from a 90-day oral study should be evaluated before conducting chronic t oxicity studies. These studies are important because 93 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS humans may be exposed to benzidine for chronic-dura tions near hazardous waste sites; such studies might be useful for the development of a chronic oral MRL. Oral data would be most relevant with respect to the most likely human exposure scenarios. Chronic- duration pharmacokinetics data were not located, but the need for such studies is not apparent at this time. Epidemiological evidence is curre ntly sufficient to qualitatively establish that benzidine is a human bladder carcinogen following occupational exposure (Bi et al. 1992; Bulbulyan et al. 1995; Ferber et al. 1976; Goldwater et al. 1965; Mancuso and El-Attar 1967; Mason et al. al. and Barsotti 1962; Zavon et al. 1973). Some studies have observed benzidine-associated increased risks for cancer at one or more other human tissue sites as well (i.e., stomach, kidney, central nervous system, oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, liver, gallbladde r, bile duct, et 1989; Montanaro et al. 1997; al. 1982; et al. 1997; Okubo et al. 1985; Piolatto et al. 1991; Wu 1988). Confirmation of these latter findings would be worthwhile, especially in the context of species and organ differences in benzidine me tabolism and susceptibility to cancer. The exposure pathways in the workplace are not known with certainty, but most probably involve a mixture of inhalation and dermal routes. One study was located regarding cancer in humans after potential oral exposure to benzidine (Budnick et al. 1984). In this study, elevated rates of cancer of the bladder and several other sites were detected in residents livi ng near a Superfund site contaminated with benzidine and other contaminants. Benzidine could not specifica lly be identified as a causative agent. Additionally, an elevated risk of bladder cancer for Japanese ki mono painters who licked benzidine-based dyes from their utensils has been reported (Yoshida and Miyakawa 1973). A study (Hanke and Krajewska 1990) has confirmed the observation that a preponderance (88% in this study) of occupationally-exposed bladder cancer patients possess the slow acetylator phenotype, thus reaffirming this characteristic as a human risk factor for developi ng cancer of the bladder. However, more recent data indicate that the acetylation rate may not be an impor tant risk factor for developing bladder cancer (Hayes et al. 1993; Rothman et al. 1996a; Zenser et al. 1996). A study using cluster analysis to examine groups of jobs with similar exposures to certain chemicals has identified an apparent relationship between exposure of parents to arylamines (including benzid ine) during preconception, prenatal, or postnatal periods and the occurrence of brain tumors in th eir children (Wilkins and Sinks 1990). When analysis was focused on inferred exposure to benzidine, e xposure of parents during the postnatal period was associated with an even greater excess risk for brain cancer in their children. However, these observations were not statistically significant, and pa rts of the analytical methodology have not yet been verified. 94 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS In animals, myeloid leukemia, several mammary tu mors, and one hepatoma were reported in 28 rats exposed to benzidine by inhalation (Zabezhinskii 1970) . A new inhalation study using more animals and a standardized protocol would be useful in expanding and extending these observations. A 30-day oral exposure was reported to induce mammary carcinoma in female rats (Griswold et al. 1968). A lifetime exposure study on both sexes with complete histopa thology would be helpful in confirming and expanding this limited study. Hamste rs fed benzidine base or benzidin e dihydrochloride developed liver and bile duct tumors, but no bladde r pathology was observed (Saffiotti et al. 1967). The primary cancer site in mice after oral exposure to benzidine is th e liver (Frith et al. 1979, 1980; Littlefield et al. 1983, 1984; Nelson et al. 1982; Schieferstein 1982), but Hard erian gland, uterine, and lung tumors, as well as reticulum cell sarcomas have also been observed (L ittlefield et al. 1983, 1984). Older, relatively limited studies have indicated that rabbits may be relatively insensitive to bladder cancer induction after oral exposure to benzidine. Of 13 rabbits exposed, 1 rabbit developed bladde r carcinoma and another developed gallbladder adenocarcinoma (Bonser 1959). No tumorigenesis at any site was noted in another study where rabbits were exposed for 20-128 days (Oida 1958a, 1958b). Oral exposure to benzidine has been shown to induce bladder cancer in dogs (Spitz et al. 1950). Exposure by subcutaneous injection has provided some additional carcinogenicity data for rats (liver and some colon tumors) (Spitz et al. 1950). Intraperitoneal injections of benzidine also incr eased the incidences of mammary and Zymbal's gland tumors in rats (Morton et al. 1981). No studies we re located regarding cancer in animals after dermal exposure to benzidine. Cancer, particularly bladder cancer, should continue to be evaluated in future epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed workers and in populations living near waste sites where benzidine has been found. However, there is no need for further animal studies at this time. Screening studies are currently being conducted in a cohort of workers occupationally exposed to benzidine both to develop a bladder cancer screening approach and to reduce the number of deaths and serious morbidity associated with baldder cancer in this cohort (see Section 3.12.3). Genotoxicity. Exposure (presumed to be primarily by i nhalation) to benzidine and benzidine-based dyes has recently been shown to induce chromosoma l aberrations and polyploidy in the circulating peripheral lymphocytes of workers (Mirkova and La lchev 1990). These observations provide evidence of benzidine's genotoxic potential in humans in an occupational-exposure setti ng, and are supported by positive gene mutation data in D. melanogaster (Fahmy and Fahmy 1977; Graf et al. 1989), as well as by positive results in rodents following oral or intraperitoneal injection exposure al. 1990; 95 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Urwin et al. 1976), chromosomal aberration induction (Das et al. 1994; Sinsheimer et al. 1992; Talaska et al. 1987), DNA adduct formation (Phillips et al. 1990), DNA damage (Parodi et al. 1981; Petzold and Swenberg 1978), and unscheduled (repair) DNA synthesis (Ashby and Mohammad 1988; Ashby et al. 1990) (see Table 3-3). When tested in many in vitro assays (Table 3-4), benzidine has generally tested positive for reverse mutation in Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation (e.g., liver S-9) (Ames et al. 1973; et al. and Pueyo Bogaert et et al. 1981; Zeiger et al. 1992); negative for SOS DNA repair in Escherichia coli (Von der Hude et al. 1988); positive for mutation in yeast (Buchholz et al. 1992; Mitchell and Gilbert 1991); positive (Oberly et al. 1990) or negative (Phillips et al. 1990) for gene mutation in Chinese hamster ovary cells; positive (Fassina et al. 1992) or negative (O'Donovon 1990; Oglesby et al. 1983) for gene mutation in Chinese ha mster V79 cells; and positive (TK locus) or negative (HGPRT locus) for gene mutation in mouse lymphom a cells (Henderson et al. 1990; Myhr and Caspary 1988). Benzidine has also tested positive for chromosome breaks (Swenberg et al. 1976) and sister chromatid exchange (Grady et al. 1986; Lindahl-K iessling et al. 1989) in cultured human and animal cells; generally positive in cultured hepatocyt es for unscheduled DNA (Kornburst Steinmetz et 1988; Williams cell transformation (Ashby et al. 1978; Pienta 1980); and negative in cu ltured mammalian cells (but positive with calf thymus DNA) in the absence of exogenous activation for DNA adduct formation (Phillips et al. 1990) (see Table 3-4). Reproductive Toxicity. No studies were located on reproductive effects in humans after exposure to benzidine by any route, for any duration. Very limited information was found regarding reproductive effects in animals. Increased incidence of at rophy of the ovaries was reported in mice receiving approximately 7.2 mg benzidine/kg/day in the drinki ng water in a chronic study (Littlefield et al. 1983). In a study in which mice were intraperitoneally in jected once per day for 5 days with 27.5-440 mg/kg/day of benzidine, no adverse effects on sperm morphology were observed (Wyrobek et al. 1981). This limited information is insufficient for drawing conclusi ons regarding the possible reproductive effects of benzidine in humans. The oral route of exposure is considered the primary route of exposure to benzidine at or near waste sites. There is no evidence of adverse reproductive effects in workers that have been exposed to benzidine. Since there is practically no information on reproductive effects of benzidine in humans or in animals, it is recommended that repr oductive organ pathology be evaluated in the 90-day oral study previously identified as data need. Multi-generation animal studies do not seem warranted at this time. Inhalation and dermal data needs are not assigned priority because they are not primary exposure routes at hazardous waste sites. 96 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Developmental Toxicity. A retrospective epidemiology study examined the incidence of birth defects in residents living near a Superfund site contaminated with benzidine, -naphthylamine, and benzene (Budnick et al. 1984). The actual extent of exposure (if any) to benzidine was not determined. If any exposure occurred, it was most probably oral, but other routes and/or toxicants could also have been involved. No increased incidence was noted for birth de fects in general, nor for any specific birth defect. A study by Wilkins and Sinks (1990) suggested an association between parental exposure to benzidine and childhood brain tumors. However, results and conc lusions of this study are largely speculative due to a lack of sufficient validation of the job exposure ma trix used to estimate exposure levels. There is no evidence that offspring from workers exposed to be nzidine have experienced adverse developmental effects. No studies were located on developmental effects in animals after exposure to benzidine by any relevant route. However, a study in which increased frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in the liver of mice fetuses fro m dams injected intraperitoneally with benzidine suggests that benzidine (or metabolites) can cross the placenta (Sanderson and Clark 1993). The limited information available is insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the possible developmental effects of benzidine in humans. The oral route of exposure is considered the primary exposure route to benzidine at or near waste sites. Given the limitations of the anecdotal report of Wilkins and Sinks (1990) and the limited evidence in animals that benzidine (or me tabolites) crosses the placenta after intraperitoneal injection (Sanderson and Clark 1993), it is recommende d that the possibility of placental transfer of benzidine or metabolites be first confirmed in an oral exposure study. Should placental transfer be established, pilot animal studies that provide inform ation on the potential embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity of benzidine may be considered. Structure activity relationship analyses performed using the TOPKAT software showed benzidine to be a developmental non-toxicant (ATSDR 1999). Inhalation and dermal data needs are not assigned priority because they are not primary exposure routes at hazardous waste sites. Immunotoxicity. Recent studies of workers exposed to benzidine (and simultaneously to other amines as well) have reported a decrease (per cell) of natural killer activity against a target human cancer cell line (Tanigawa et al. 1990) and changes in numbers of some T lymphocyte populations (Araki et al. 1993; Sung et al. 1995; Tanigawa et al. 1996). Although the status of the immune system was apparently not compromised by these effects, continued evaluati on of these workers, and of other cohorts that might be identified, could be of value in an attempt to confirm these findings and to look for additional evidence of immunologic alterations. Should the effect be substantiated, it would be of interest to investigate the underlying mechanisms, especially because in some cases, the effect was noted nearly 20 years after the last arylamine exposure. One 5-day oral mouse study has identified several manifestations of 97 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS immunotoxicity, including altered natural killer cell activity (Luster et al. 1992); however, doses causing the effects were not specified. Thus, additional quantitative animal studies to help define these apparent immunotoxic effects, their mechanisms, and associated dose-response relationshi ps would be valuable. This could be accomplished in a 90-day oral study that examines lymphoid tissues and relevant blood components (i.e., peripheral lymphocytes). No inhala tion or dermal studies are needed at this time because they are not primary exposure routes at hazardous waste sites. Neurotoxicity. No studies were located regarding neurotoxic effects in humans after inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure to benzidine for any duration. In animals, a significant incidence of spongiform leukoencephalopathy (vacuolization of brain ce lls) was observed at the lowest dose tested (1.8 mg/kg/day) in a large, oral lifetime study in mice (Littlefield et al. 1983; Morgan et al. 1981). The effect was dose-dependent and specific to a certain re gion of the brain. The relevance of this finding to human health is unknown. The fact that no studies were located that reported neurological effects among workers exposed to benzidine suggest that the nervous system may not be a target for benzidine toxicity. No studies were located regarding neurological effect s in animals after inhalation or dermal exposure. Considering the findings of Littlefield et al. (1983) and Morgan et al. (1981), it may be valuable to evaluate neuropathology in a 90-day study by the oral route, the primary route of exposure for populations living near waste sites. The inhalation and dermal route of exposures are not considered primary routes of exposure at hazardous waste sites. Epidemiological and Human Dosimetry Studies. With the exception of those who may live near certain hazardous waste sites or a small number of factories, the probability of exposure of the general population to benzidine is ve ry low. Benzidine is no longer produced for commercial sale in the United States. There are a number of published epidemiology studies that provide evidence that benzidine is a carcinogen in humans, but these studi es do not provide good quantitative exposure data and focus mainly on bladder cancer (Bi et al. 1992; Bulbulyan et al. 1995; Ferber et al. 1990; Zavon et al. 1973). Some epidemiological studies have also suggested an association between benzidine exposure and risk for cancer at one or more tissue sites as well (Bulbulyan et al. 1995; Delzell et al. et al. 1985; Piolatto et al. 1991; Wu 1988). Thus, there remains a need for epidemiological data that can provide quantitative human dose-response information, and that can better address end points such as cancer at other sites and alterations of immunocompetence. The controversy of whether slow acetylators are at higher risk for 98 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS benzidine-induced bladder cancer than fast acetylators appear to have been answered (Rothman et al. 1996a; Zenser et al.1996) such that further research on this issue seems of questionable value at this time. In addition to cancer, studies of workers exposed to benzidine (and simultaneously to other amines) have reported a decrease (per cell) of natural killer activity against a target human cancer cell line (Tanigawa et al. 1990) and changes in numbers of some T lymphocyte populations (Araki et al. 1993; Sung et al. 1995; Tanigawa et al. 1996). It should be mentioned, how ever, that the status of the immune system was apparently not compromised by these effects. W ith the exception of those who may live near certain hazardous waste sites or a small number of factories, the probability of exposure of the general population to benzidine is very low. Benzidine is no longer commercially produced or used in the United States and it has been detected in only 28 of 1,585 NPL hazardous waste sites. However, in the unlikely event that exposure of the general population (in the past or present) primarily to benzidine is identified, individuals should be monitored for bladder cancer incidence and immunological effects. Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect. Exposure. A variety of benzidine-related compounds can be detected in the urine of humans exposed to benzidine or benzidine-based dyes 1996a; Sciarini and Meigs Troll et al. 1963). These include benzidine itself, hydroxylated and or acetylated me tabolites, and various and High performance liquid chroma tography coupled with absorbance detection was reported to permit identification of urinary concentra tions of benzidine and its monoacetylated derivative as low as 0.25 \u00b5g/L and of its diacetylated derivativ e as low as 0.5 \u00b5g/L (Dewan et al. 1988). Urinary detection of benzidine and its metabolites is suitabl e only for recent exposure scenarios, as animal studies indicate that most excretion occurs within the firs t week or so following exposure (Kellner et al. 1973; Lynn et al. 1984; Shah and Guthrie 1983). In studies with rats, hemoglobin adducts of benzidine and some of its metabolites have been detected by hi gh performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrochemical detector (Birner et al. 1990; Ne umann 1988; Zwirner-Baier and Neumann 1998). This may prove a useful biomarker for exposures of intermediate-duration (or for detection of exposure after such intervals have elapsed since the last exposure), as the data suggest that levels of hemoglobin adducts are proportional to dose over a large dose range, and are indicative of cumulative exposure during the lifetime of the erythrocytes (120 days in humans). There are biomarkers of long-term exposure to benzidine. DNA adducts of benzidin e and its metabolites can also be extremely sensitive biomarkers for detecting and quantifying exposure. Such adducts could be detected in as little as 1 \u00b5g of mouse hepatic DNA, after as little as 3 hours of exposure (Levy and Weber 1988). Similarly attomole (10 -18 mole) 99 BENZIDINE 3. HEALTH EFFECTS quantities of benzidine-DNA adduct could be detected in human peripheral lymphocytes exposed in vitro to benzidine (Gupta et al. 1988). DNA adducts have also been detected in peripheral white blood cells (Zhou et al. 1997) and urine (Rothman et al. 1996a, 1997) from workers exposed to benzidine. Analysis of mutations in specific genes in bladder cancer cases will continue to provide important information for the characterization of bladder cancer induced by benzidine and other arylamines (Novara et al. 1996; Sorlie et al. 1998; Yasunaga et al. 1997). These pro cedures might help in medical surveillance for early detection of cancer and treatment. Effect . It appears likely that most of benzidine's toxic effects are mediated through the binding of its activated metabolites to cellular macromolecules. Th erefore, the previously discussed benzidine-derived adducts with DNA and hemoglobin may also be considered biomarkers of effect which could eventually be used for dosimetry. Experiments with radiolabeled benzidine or N-acetylbenzidine have demonstrated significant amounts of binding to DNA in the liver, kidney, and bladder of dogs (Beland et al. 1983; Lakshmi et al. 1990a). The highest concentrati on of binding was found in the bladder transitional epithelium, the principal site of benzidine's carci nogenicity in this species. Elevated frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and polyploidy have recently been detected in the circulating peripheral lymphocytes of workers exposed to benzidine a nd benzidine-based dyes (Mirkova and Lalchev 1990), and bacterial mutagenicity has been detected in the urine and bile of rodents treated with benzidine (Bos et al. 1980, 1981; Chipman and Mohn 1989). However, these and other manifestations of benzidine's genotoxicity are not specific to benzidine or even to arylamines. Reduced arylsulfotransferase activity in liver cytosol was reported in rats exposed to benzidine, and may be characteristic of many rat hepatocarcinogens (Ringer and Norton 1988). Its sen sitivity, relative specificity, and relevance as a potential human biomarker are not currently known. The use of urinary cytology to detect and examine exfoliated bladder cells has been reported to be useful in screening for human bladder cancer (e.g., Crosby et al. 1991; Mason et al. 1986; Tsuchiya et al. 1975). By itself, this biomarker is not specific to benzidine exposure, but studies investigating the po ssible detection of benzidine-DNA adducts in such cells may be of value in enhancing specificity. Several reports observed s ubtle immunologic alterations in workers exposed to benzidine and/or -naphthylamine (Araki et al. 1993; Sung et al. 1995; Tanigawa et al. 1990, 1996). Confirmation of these findings and an investigation of its basis, reproducibility, and agent-specificity could be useful in determining wh ether this effect has any potential as a relatively easily monitored biomarker. Evaluation of additional possible biomarkers will in part depend on the identification of additional toxic effects from any fu rther acute-, intermediate-, or chronic-duration studies. BENZIDINE 100 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion. No quantitative studies were located regarding the rate or extent of absorption in hum ans or animals after inhalation or oral exposure to benzidine. However, relatively rapid absorption can be inferred from an occupational study in which urinary levels of benzidine increased 4-fold during a workshift involving primarily inhalation exposure (Zavon et al. 1973). Similarly, significant absorption of benzidine-based dyes was indicated by the detection of benzidine and its acetylated metabolites in the urine of workers exposed to the dust of Direct Black 38 (Dewan et al. 1988). However, the rela tive contributions of pulmonary, oral, and dermal absorption were not addressed. Absorption after oral exposure to benzidine in mice (Martin et al. 1982) and dogs (Beland et al. 1983) was indirectly indicat ed by covalent binding of benzidine metabolites to DNA in liver and bladder tissue. Benzidine produced by microfloral reduction of benzidine-based dyes in the intestines was indirectly determined to be absorbable, and benzidine (but not the dyes) was demonstrated to be transported across the mucosa of an isolated segment of rat intestine in a perfusion chamber (Bos et al. 1986). Benzidine, in combination with acetone or DMSO, sodium lauryl sulfate, and/or methyl nicotinate was shown to be absorbed by isolated perfused porcine skin flaps; the addition of the reducing agent SnCl 2 resulted in an inhibition of benzidine absorption (Baynes et al. 1996). No quantitative studies were located regarding absorption in humans after dermal exposure to benzidine, but benzidine and its metabolites were detected in the pos t-workshift urine of workers exposed to benzidine (Ferber et al. 1976; Meigs et al. and Meigs 1961). After applying radiolabeled benzidine to the shaved skins of rats, the percentages of applied radioactivity detected in the blood were 0.2, 0.3, and 0.7% after 1, 8, and 24 hours, respectively (Shah and Guthrie 1983). Benzidine-derived radioactivity was distributed throughout the body, with approximately half still remaining at the site of application after 24 hours. A study of dermal applica tion of radiolabeled benzidine to the shaved skin of rabbits and rats reported 3 and 5% of the radioactivity detected in the urine and feces of the rabbits, respectively, and 0.05 and 0.16% in the urine and f eces of the rats, respectively (Aldrich et al. 1986). Although sparse, the collective data suggest that benzidine can be absorbed by all three major routes, with absorption and distribution occurring fairly rapidly after inhalation or oral exposure. The relative contribution of inhalation, oral, and dermal rout es to typical occupational exposures remains one area where further studies could be useful. More recent studies have also provided evidence of inhalation absorption in workers exposed to benzidine (DeMarini et al. 1997; Rothman et al. 1996a). No studies were located regarding distribution in hum ans after inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure to benzidine. BENZIDINE 101 3. HEALTH EFFECTS No studies were located regarding distribution in anim als after inhalation or oral exposure to benzidine or benzidine-based dyes. At 1, 8, and 24 hours after appli cation of radiolabeled benzidine to the skin of rats (Shah and Guthrie 1983), organ distribution of radio activity was approximately as follows: liver (1.5, 1.0, and 0.7%), lung (0.09, 0.2, and 0.2%), intestines (1.0, 14.0, and 1.3%), stomach (0.5, 0.4, and 0.08%), and carcass (1.9, 4.1, and 6.9%). After 24 hours, approximately half of the radioactivity remained at the site of application, while 41% was found in the urine and feces. Several studies have reported distribution data for time points ranging fro m less than 1 hour to 3-7 days after intravenous administration of benzidine to rats, dogs, and monkeys (Kellner et al. 1973; Lakshmi et al. 1990a; Lynn et al. 1984). It appears that benzidine clearance from the blood is at least several fold more rapid than that of its metabolites, that clearance is biphasic with most (90%) occurring during the first 24 hours, and that radiolabel is distributed throughout much of the body, relative amounts often reflecting species specificity for cancer target organs. Data from rats and mice also suggest that enterohepatic recycling may contribute to the continued retention, further metabo lism, and toxicity of be nzidine and its metabolites (Chipman and Mohn 1989). Although the contribution of the inhalation, oral, and dermal routes to benzidine body burden has not been clearly estab lished in occupational studies, the mechanism of benzidine toxicity is not route-rela ted, and therefore, additional animal studies to examine distribution of benzidine do not appear necessary at this time. There is substantial information available from human, animal, and in vitro studies concerning various aspects of benzidine's complex metabolism. Numerous in vivo metabolites in a variety of species have been reported (EPA 1980a, 1986c; Whysner et al. 1996; Zenser et al. 1998). The urine and bile of humans and animals have been reported to contain free benzidine, a variety of hydroxylated and/or acetylated metabolites, of Lynn et al. 1984; Sciarini and Meigs 1958, 1961). Although no studies were located to demonstrate that metabolism may be substantially influenced by route of exposure, determining the relative importance of several potential metabolic pathways in hepatic versus nonhepatic tissue could lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of benz idine toxicity and carcinogenicity. As with many other arylamines, benzidine is thought to require metabolic activation through N-oxidation to electrophilic derivatives capable of binding DNA in order to manif est its genotoxicity and carcinogenicity (Beland et al. 1983; Brouns et al. 1982; Iba 1987). Studies have shown that three main chemical reactions are involved in the metabolism of benzidine: N-acetylati on, N-oxidation, al. 1995a, 1997; Lynn et al. 1984. Because primary amines are easier to oxidize than the acetylated amide products, N-acetylation is considered a det oxification reaction and competes with N-oxidation. BENZIDINE 102 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Also, because amides do not form glucuronides, N-glucuronidation and N-acetylation are also competing pathways. The prevalence of any one of these r eactions is species-specific and seems to ultimately determine the potential development of organ-specifi c cancer. Continued research on the involvement of these main pathways in the metabolism of benzidine and the development of inhibitors of specific reactions could help in the prevention of benzidine- induced toxicity. Other enzymatic pathways in the bioactivation of benzidine, particularly in the bladder, have also been suggested (Flammang et al. 1989; Wise et al. 1984c). Studies to date have also not addressed whether saturation phenomena may come into play in the metabolism of benzidine by one or more of these pathways. Such information would be useful in extrapolating to human exposure situations. No studies were found regarding excretion in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to benzidine. However, benzidine and acetylated derivatives were detected in the urine of workers exposed to benzidine-based dyes (Dewan et al. 1988; NIOSH 1980c). These dyes thought to be reduced to free benzidine by azoreductase of the liver and intestinal microflora. Inhalation was presumed to be the major route of exposure, but dermal exposure may also have been a factor. Information regarding excretion in humans after oral exposure to benzidine is quite limited, but urinary free benzidine and various hydroxylated and/or acetylated derivatives have been reported (Englebertz and Babel 1953; Troll et al. 1963). Similar data have also been generated in th e rat (Lynn et al. 1984) and monkey (Rinde and Troll 1975). In rats treated with a single oral dose of benz idine, excretion was primarily via the feces, but the percentage excreted in the urin e increased with increasing dose (Lynn et al. 1984). The percentage of various benzidine metabolites in the urine was similar in rats treated with the low (0.5 mg/kg) and mid- level (5.0 mg/kg) dose, but changed slightly when the dose was increased to 50 mg/kg. No excretion was detected in expired air. Urinary excretion of be nzidine and its metabolites was detected in workers thought to be exposed primarily by the dermal rout e (Meigs et al. 1951, 1954; Sciarini and 1961). In rats exposed dermally to radiolabeled benzidine, excretion was again principally via the urine during the first 8 hours, but by 24 hours, was nearly equally divided between feces and urine (Shah and Guthrie 1983). Similar results were found in rats after intr avenous exposure (Kellner et al. 1973; Lynn et al. 1984), where it was also shown that virtually all fecal metabolites originate in the liver and are excreted in the bile. After intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of benzidine, excretion data have also been generated for dogs (Kellner et al. 1973; Lakshmi et al. 1990a; Sciarini and Meigs 1958), monkeys (Kellner et al. 1973), and mice (Sciarini and Meigs 1961). Current data support the hypothesis that the exposure route is not a critical variable in benzidine's excretion. BENZIDINE 103 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Comparative Toxicokinetics. Current data indicate that benzidine's principal target organ varies from species to species. For example, as noted above , in humans and dogs (and perhaps more weakly in rabbits), the bladder is the principal target organ, whereas in rats, mice, and hamsters, the liver is the primary target. In vivo and especially in vitro studies have indicated that species vary in cytochrome P-450 content (Neis et al. 1985b), acetylation al. 1982; Lakshmi et al. 1990a, 1995a, Moore et al. 1984; Wang et al. 1990), sulfotransferase activity (Martin et al. 1982), and glucuronidation activity (Babu et al. 1993a, 1994a, 1994b). These findings have helped elucidate the basis for th e species-specific carcinogenic response to exposure to benzidine. The principal route of excretion of benz idine is also species dependent, being the feces in rats (Kellner et al. 1973; Lynn et al. 1984) and the urine in dogs (Kellner et al. 1973; Lakshmi et al. 1990a) after intravenous injection. In addition, a derm al study on benzidine-based dyes (Aldrich et al. 1986) reported little absorption of benzidine on the shaved skin of rabbits. Therefore, additional toxicokinetic studies are needed to identify th e best animal model for humans. Without further understanding of relevant mechanisms and more de tailed data from different species, the rat seems insufficient, and even the dog (a frequently mentioned candidate) has its shortcomings (it cannot acetylate as well as humans and most other species can) in being a model for hum ans. In addition, more quantitative information, especially on human absorption at occupational exposure levels, would also assist in extrapolating animal data to humans. Methods for Reducing Toxic Effects. No studies were located regarding the mechanism of absorption in humans or animals after inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure to benzidine. However, it might be expected that gastrointestinal absorpti on of benzidine immediately following oral exposure could be reduced by induced emesis, gastric lavage, sa line cathartics, in obtunded, comatose, or convulsing patients. Also, oils should not be used as a cathartic, as they may enhance the gastrointestinal absorption of benzidine. Saline cat hartics should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function. Following dermal exposur e to benzidine, contaminated clothing should be removed and contacted skin washed immediately with soap and water, or the contacted eye immediately irrigated, perhaps with the assistance of proparacai ne Currance 1988; Sittig 1991; Stutz and Janusz 1988). There is no information on the distribution of benzidine following exposure in humans, but studies in animals suggest that benzidine does not tend to accumulate in the body. No studies were located regarding methods for reducing body burden after inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure to benzidine. Human and animal studi es indicate that benzidine is excreted fairly rapidly in the urine and/or feces (Lynn et al. 1984; Meigs et al. 1951; Sciarini and Meigs 1961), but much animal BENZIDINE 104 3. HEALTH EFFECTS data suggest that enterohepatic recirculation is involved in prolonging the retention and subsequent metabolism of benzidine (Chipman and Mohn 1989; Ly nn et al. 1984). Relatively prompt and repeated administration of activated charcoal (which is sometimes administered to minimize enterohepatic recirculation of persistent chemicals) may therefor e be of some benefit in reducing the body burden of benzidine. Benzidine probably produces most of its toxic effects through the binding of oxidized reactive intermediates to nucleic acid and protein target mol ecules. Currently, there is little that can be done to intervene once binding has occurred. However, several studies have discussed and provided data concerning interrupting the prostaglandin H synthase activation pathway, which is speculated to be of importance especially in bladder and other extra-hepatic tissues (Lakshmi et al. 1990b; Zenser and Davis 1990; Zenser et al. 1980, 1983). It is possible that this enzyme pathway could be inhibited with aspirin or indomethacin, that activation could be inhibited by competitive substrates methimazole, MK447), that reactive intermediates (e .g., could be reduced back to parent compounds (e.g., benzidine) by reducing agents (vitamin C) or antioxidants (ethoxyquin, butylated hydroxytoluene), or that benzidine and could be inactivated and eliminated by conjugation with molecules such as glutathione. Inte rvention with antioxidant, reducing, and conjugating agents would also be expected to be of some va lue for inhibiting bioactivation by any of the other potentially involved enzymic pathways. Further inv estigation of such approaches across animal species and in humans would be useful. Children's Susceptibility. The information on health effects of benzidine in humans is derived mainly from occupational studies. Despite the inherent limitations of these types of studies, there is conclusive evidence that benzidine is a bladder car cinogen in humans (Bi et al. 1992; Bulbulyan et al. 1995; Ferber et al. 1976; Goldwater et al. 1965; Mancuso and El-Attar 1967; Mason et al. al. 1990; Zavon et al. 1973). Occupational studies have provided also suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity at other tissue sites (Delzell et al. 1989; Morinaga et al. 1982; Okubo et al. 1985; Piolatto et al. 1991; Wu 1988). Such exposure scenarios for children seem unrealistic. There is no information available to determine whether children and adults are equally susceptible to the toxic effects of benzidine, but given the unlikelihood of exposure to benzidin e by the general population, such studies do not seem warranted at this time. There is no information on whether the developmental process is altered in humans exposed to benzidine. No data were located regarding developmental effects of benzidine in animals after any route of exposure. Experiments to determine whether benzidine (or its metabolites) can cross the placenta and/or be BENZIDINE 105 3. HEALTH EFFECTS transferred to offspring via breast milk would be helpful in assessing whether the developmental process might be affected in the offspring of animals exposed to benzidine by a relevant route of exposure. There is some indirect evidence that benzidine or its me tabolites can cross the placenta. This evidence is based on the results of a study in which intraperitoneal administration of benzidine to pregnant mice resulted in the induction of micronuclei in the liver of fetuses (Sanderson and Clark 1993). There is no information on whether prenatal or postnatal exposure to benzid ine can affect childhood cancer incidence. There are no data to evaluate whether pharmacokinetics of benzidine in children are different from adults. There are no PBPK models for benzidine, but a need for such a model is not apparent at this time. There is no information to evaluate whether metabolism of benzidin e in children is different than in adults, but there are some theoretical reasons to suspect that it mi ght be different, including the fact that subsets of metabolic enzymes thought to participate in benzidine metabolism appear to be developmentally regulated (Leeder and Kearns 1997). Children are highly unlikely to be exposed to benzidin e and, consequently, there is no apparent need to develop biomarkers of exposure for children. It is reasonable to assume that biomarkers that could be developed for adults would also be applicable to children. There are no data on the interactions of benzidine with other chemicals in children or adults . There are no pediatric-specific methods to reduce peak absorption for benzidine following exposure, to reduce body burdens, or to interfere with benzidine's mechanism of action, but it is reasonabl e to assume that exposure avoidance measures should be applied to children as needed. Child health data needs relating to exposure are discussed in 6.3.1 Identification of Data Needs: Exposures of Children. 3.12.3 Ongoing Studies A limited number of ongoing studies concerning health effects and mechanisms of action associated with benzidine have been identified in the Federa l Research In Progress database (FEDRIP 2000). These studies, summarized below, may help fill some of the data needs previously identified. Dr. K.H. Brock, from the Environmental Health Resear ch and Testing, Inc., Durham, North Carolina, is developing cell-mediated activation systems with rodent liver, bladder, kidney, and intestinal cells for benzidine-based dyes in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y TK/assay to determine the metabolite profile of these dyes in the specific tissue. Future studies w ill determine the capacity of humans cells from these BENZIDINE 106 3. HEALTH EFFECTS tissues to activate benzidine-based dyes to a mutageni c/clastogenic form. This research is sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Dr. T.R. Devereux, from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institute of Health, plans to examine a set of human bladder tumors from a cohort of people occupationally exposed to benzidin e by genomic hybridization for gains or losses of genetic material. The research is sponsored by NIEHS. Dr. G.P. Hemstreet at the University of Oklahom a Health Science Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, plans to continue screening studies in a cohort of workers occupationally exposed to benzidine both to develop a bladder cancer screening approach and to reduce the number of deaths and serious morbidity associated with bladder cancer in this cohor t. The research is sponsored by NIOSH. Dr. G.M. Lower, from BC Research, Gay Mills, Wisconsin, will use sulfamethazine phenotyping to examine well-defined Japanese bladder cancer populati ons with and without histories of cigarette smoking, and with and without known o ccupational exposure to benzidine or -naphthylamine. The results are expected to allow assessment of the re lationship between arylamine-induced bladder cancer and the slow acetylator phenotype as a determinant of susceptibility. This research is sponsored by the DHHS. Dr. T.K. Rao, from Integrated Laboratory Systems, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, proposes to conduct cell-mediated metabolism/mutagenesis studies to examine cell/tissue/species specificity for a number of bladder carcinogens. Several factors th at affect induction and promotion of bladder carcinogenesis will be investigated. This research is sponsored by the DHHS. Dr. T.V. Zenser at the Veterans' Administration Medical Center, St. Louis, Missouri, is conducting research aimed at elucidating the pathways involve d in benzidine metabolism and DNA-adduct formation in humans exposed to benzidine. This research is s ponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Under the sponsorship of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Dr. Zenser is also assessing the possible formation of the DNA-adduct, N'-(3'-monophospho-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-N -acetylbenzidine, by peroxidatic activation of "}
