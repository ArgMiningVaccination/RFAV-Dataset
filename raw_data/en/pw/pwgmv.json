Though most today have never even heard of this illness, it would routinely kill over ten thousand children in a single year\u2014more than the polio might take in an entire decade. After much trial and tribulation, a shot was developed that helped both those already afflicted with the illness, and those who might one day become infected. But the shot was dangerous, and many parents refused it for their children. In 1932, a safer version of the shot was developed, but contained a new ingredient never before tried on humans. Due to aggressive immunization campaigns, children all over the country began to receive this shot. Within a year, a new mental disorder\u2014unknown to even the most knowledgeable child psychologists in the country\u2014began to appear. It affected toddlers, and mostly boys. Children were losing the ability to speak and would take little interest in any other humans\u2014even their parents. The Autism Vaccine chronicles the story of two of these children\u2014one known throughout the world, the other completely unknown until recently\u2014and why modern medicine's attempts to explain what happened to them have so far come up short.
