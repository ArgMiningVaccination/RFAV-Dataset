Glossary of Acronyms ....................................................... 26 Introduction Vision A Healthy Texas Mission To improve the health, safety, and well-being of Texans through good stewardship of public resources, and a focus on core public health functions. Values Lead with a vision Driven by science and data Partner with a purpose Engage and connect as a team DSHS has two foundational role s in Texas public health: 1. State leader for the public and population health system, and 2. Provider of state public health programs and services. Public Health is the science and professional discipline of preventing, detecting, and responding to specific medical risks an d conditions. Public health looks at the issues, policies, and outcomes and is concerned with broad disease categories across all communities. Population Health focuses on health outcomes of a group of individuals or communities and measures the incidence and prevalence of health conditions and disease within a defined population. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part I 1 Public Health and Population Health Data Trends and Charts Leading Causes of Death In 2020, the most recent year for wh ich death data is available, chronic diseases accounted for a majority of the leading causes of death in Texas. Chronic diseases are generally ch aracterized by a long period of development, a prolonged course of il lness, functional impairment or disability, multiple risk factors, and low curability. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part I 2 Data Source Deaths: Texas Death Certificate Data County population: Texas Demographic Center 2019 population estimates Prepared by: Texas Department of State Health Se rvices, Center for Health St atistics Date of run: 05/05/2022 Please note that data for 2020 are provisional. Provisional statistics are tabulated based on data that are not yet edited and may be incomplete. Provided data are subject to change before data are finalized. Data Description and Measure Information Counts of 1-9, and their corre sponding rates, are suppressed to preven t the identification of individuals in confidential data. Calculated death rates are based on the total number of crude deaths in 2020 divided by 100,000 estimated population from the 2019 Texas Demographic Center and have not been adjusted. This death data comes from death certificates for Texas re sidents who died in state and out of state. Each death certificate identifies a single underlying cause of death th at is defined as the disease or injury that initiated the events resulting in death. Causes of death are coded using the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) implemented in 1999. Texas adopted the new U.S. Standard Certificates of Deat h and Fetal Death in 2006, so some data items might not be directly comparable with previous years. Causes of death are aggregated based on predefined list s of cause-of-death categories developed by National Center for Health Statis tics (NCHS) for tabulating mortality statistics . The causes of death presented in the table refer to the NCHS List of 113 Selected Causes of Deat h: ICD-10 Cause-of-Death Lists for Tabulating Mortality Statistics. The top ten causes of death are based on NCHS' broader 51 rankable cause-of-death categories. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part I 3 This page intentionally left blank.

DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II C-31. Introduction The Health and Human Services (HHS) System administers programs to encourage participation by historically underutilized businesses (HUBs) in all contracting and subcontracting by HHS agencies. The HHS System's HUB Programs are designed to enhance the ability of HUBs to compete for HHS System contracts, increase agencies' awareness of such businesses, ensure meaningful HUB participation in the procurement process and assist HHS System agencies in achieving their HUB goals. Each state agency is required to include in its strategic plan a HUB plan. The section below describes, in its entirety, a coordinated HUB plan that covers the HHS System's HUB programs as a whole. 2. Goal The goal o f the HHS System HUB Plan is to promote fair and competitive business opportunities that maximize the inclusion of minority, woman and service - disabled veteran- owned businesses that are certified HUBs in the procurement and contracting activities of HHS System agencies. 3. Objective The HHS System strives to meet or exceed the Statewide Annual HUB Utilization Goals and/or agency -specific goals that are identified each fiscal year (FY) in the procurement categories related to the HHS System's current strategies and programs. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II C-44. Outcome Measures In accordance with Texas Government Code Section 2161(d)(5) and the State's Disparity Study, state agencies are required to establish their own HUB goals based on scheduled fiscal year expenditures and the availability of HUBs in each procurement category. The HHS System has adopted the Statewide HUB Goals as the agency -specific goals. In procuring goods and services through contracts, the HHS System, as well as each of its individual agencies, will make a good -faith effort to meet or exceed the statewide goals, as described in Table 1, for contracts the agency expects to award in a fiscal year. Table 1: Statewide HUB Goals by Procurement Categories, Fiscal Year 202 2 PROCUREMENT CATEGORIES UTILIZATION GOALS Heavy Construction 11.20% Building Construction 21.10% Special Trade Construction 32.90% Professional Services Contracts 23.70% Other Services Contracts 26.00% Commodity Contracts 21.10% Source: Data from FY 2022 Statewide HUB Report, Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. The HHS System will collectively use the following outcome measure to gauge progress: Total expenditures and the percentage of purchases awarded directly and indirectly through subcontracts to HUBs under the procurement categories. Each HHS System agency may track additional outcome measures. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II C-55. HHS System Strategies The HHS System maintains and implement s policies and procedures, in accordance with the HUB statute and rules, to guide the agencies in increasing the use of HUBs by contracting directly and/or indirectly through subcontracting. The HHS System employ several additional strategies, such as: Implementing policies to ensure good faith effort requirements are performed and maintained from the development of the solicitation through the duration of the contract Utilizing the Centralized Master Bidders List and HUB Directory to solicit bids from HUBs Maintaining a HUB Program Office of HUB Coordinators at HHSC headquarters for effective coordination for all HHS agencies Developing and implementing reporting practices to provide updates to the Executive Commissioner, Chief Operating Officer, Deputy ExecutiveCommissioners and Associate Commissioners on HHS HUB Program activities, related initiatives, and projects Developing target- marketing strate gies inclusive of web-b ased training to provide guidance on HHS System procurements Maintaining an active upcoming Procurement Forecast schedule on website to provide notices of opportunities prior to posting to encourage HUB participation Increasing awareness of the HUB Program across the HHS System by providing information to all new employees and how they may assist in theefforts to increase HUB utilization Enhancing outreach efforts internally and externally by promoting access, awareness, and accountability through education and training Increasing HUB participation in Spot Bid purchases by mandating the agency solicit a HUB for purchases starting at $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 6. Output Measures The HHS System will collectively use and individually track the following output measures to gauge progress: DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II C-6The total number of bids received from HUBs The total number of contracts awarded to HUBs The total amount of HUB subcontracting expenditures The total amount of HUB Procurement Card expenditures The total number of mentor -prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements The total number of HUBs provided assistance in becoming HUB certified. Additional output measures which may be used by specific System agencies: The total number of outreach initiatives such as HUB forums attended and sponsored The total number of HUB training provided to the vendor community as well as internally to agency staff. 7. HUB External Asses sment According to the Comptroller of Public Accounts , the HHS System collectively awarded 10.46 % in FY 20 20, and 3.45% in FY 20 21 to HUBs . Tables 2 and 3 reflects utilization for HHSC and DSHS total spending with HUBs directly and indirectly through subcontracting use.

A substantial portion of the $5.8 billion was expended on the state's response to the COVID pand emic which were made using the emergency procurement process which resulted in the decrease in percentage spent withcertified HUBs. The HHS System agencies continuously strive to make internal improvements to meet or exceed HUB goals. HHS System agencies continued outreach efforts to educate HUBs and minority businesses about the procurement process. Other areas of progress include: Maintaining relationships with the Texas Association of African- American Chambers of Commerce and the Texas Association of Mexican- American Chambers of Commerce among other organizations focus ed on small minority, women, and/or service -disabled veteran- owned businesses Conducting post- contract- award meetings with contractors to discuss HUB Subcontracting Plan compliance and monthly reporting requirements Additional goals include: Enhancing minority/woman/services -disabled veteran- owned business participation in HHS System -sponsored HUB Forums where exhibitors may participate in trade -related conferences Enhancing HHS System HUB reporting capabilities Expanding HHS System mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program vision to maximize the DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II C-8state's resources through cooperation and assistance from other public entities and corporate businesses Promoting and increasing awareness o f HHS System procurement opportunities for direct and indirect capacity.

Executive Summary The Health and Human Services (HHS) System Strategic Staffing Analysis and Workforce Plan is an integral part of HHS' staffing plan. Workforce planning is a business necessity due to many factors, including: constraints on funding; increasing demand for HH S services; increasing number of current employees reaching retirement age resulting in fewer, less experienced workers available as replacements; and increasing competition for highly skilled employees. HHS agencies are proactively addressing this challenge by preparing for the future and reducing risks. Designed for flexibility, the HHS System Strategic Staffing Analysis and Workforce Plan allows HHS executive management to make staffing adjustments according to the changing needs of HHS agencies. State leaders in Texas recognize the importance of workforce planning. As part of their strategic plans, state agencies are required under the Texas Government Code, Section 2056.0021, to develop a workforce plan in accordance with the guidelines developed by the State Auditor's Office (SAO). To meet these requirements, this HHS Workforce Plan - a Schedule attachment to the HHS System Strategic Plan for the Fiscal Years 2023- 2027 - analyzes the following key elements for the entire HHS System: Current Workforce De mographics - Describes how many employees work for the HHS agencies, where they work, what they are paid, how many of them are return- to-work retirees, how many have left HHS, how many may retire, and whether minority groups are underutilized when compared to the state Civilian Labor Force (CLF) for Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) job categories. The workforce is examined by gender, race, age and length of state service. Expected Workforce Challenges - Describes anticipated staffing needs based on population trends, projected job growth and other demographictrends. A detailed examination of each identified shortage occupation was conducted to identify and understand retention and recruitment problems. Strategies to Meet Workforce Needs - Describes recrui tment and retention strategies that address expected workforce challenges for shortageoccupation jobs. The following is the detailed HHS System Strategic Staffing Analysis and Workforce Plan. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-8DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-92. Health and Human Services The Health and Human Services System, as reflected in Article II of the General Appropriations Act, consists of the two agencies described below : Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC).

The utilization analysis was conducted for each HHS agency using the 80 percent rule. This rule compares the actual number of employees to the expected number of employees based on the available state CLF for Black, Hispanic and Female employees. For purposes of this analysis, a group is considered potentially DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-16underutil ized when the actual representation in the workforce is less than 80 percent of what the expected number would be based on the CLF. The HHSC Civil Rights Office (CRO) reviewed and conducted analyses for each individual agency's workforce to identify potential underutilization. The utilization analysis of the HHS agencies for fiscal year 2021 indicated potential underutilization in the HHSC workforce. The foll owing table summarizes the results of the utilization analysis for the HHS System.

The other job category showing potential underutilization is Service Maintenance, which comprises 5.2% of the HHS System workforce. Figure 6: HHS System - Percent of Employees by Job Category DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-17Veterans About four percent of the workforce ( 1,646 employees) are veterans. Table 9: HHS System Workforce by Veter ans Status27 State Service Approximately 40 percent of the workforce has 10 or more years of state service. About 19 percent of the workforce have been with the state for less than two years.

When recruiting for shortage occupations, special skill required positions or for special projects, retirees provide a good source of relevant program -specific knowledge. Rehired retirees constitute about three percent of the total HHS workforce. 36 DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-19Figure 9: HHS Return -to-Work Retirees by Percent of Workforce HHS management understands that demographic trends over the next decade will increasingly impact recruitment from typical sources. Retired workers who have institutional knowledge will be needed to pass their expertise to others. Dealing with an aging workforce will require HHS agencies to attract more people to apply for work, encourage them to work longer and help make them more productive. Creative strategies are being planned to keep older workers on the job, such as hiring retirees as temporary status employees; letting employees phase into retirement by working part time; having experienced workers mentor younger employees; promoting telecommuting, flexible hours and job- sharing; and/or urging retirement- ready workers to take sabbaticals instead of stepping down. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-204. Turnover The HHS System turnover rate for fiscal year 2021 was 26.1 percent, about five percent higher than the statewide turnover rate of 21.5 percent.37 38 Table 12: HHS System Workforce - Turno ver for FY 19 - FY 21 (excludes inter -HHS agency transfers)39 Agency FY 20 FY 21 HHS System 27.6% 24.2% 26.1% Of the two HHS agencies, HHSC experienced the highest turnover rate ( 27.1 percent) .40 Table 13: Turnover by HHS Agency for FY 21 (includes inter -HHS agency transfers and excludes legislatively mandated transfers) Agency Average Annual Headcount Total Separations Turnover Rate HHSC 37,199 26.1% Turnover at HHS agencies was highest for Males at HHSC (at 28.4 percent) and lowest for Females at DSHS (at 15.1 percent).

Retirement Projections Currently, about 11 percent of the HHS workforce is potentially eligible to retire and leave state employment. About 2. 6 percent of the eligible employees retire each fiscal year. If this trend continues, approximately 13 percent of the current workforce is expected to retire in the next five years.61 Table 18: HHS System Retirements - Percent of Wor kforce (FY 17 - FY 21) Fiscal Year Retirement Losses Retirement Turnover Rate 2017 989 2.4% 2018 First -Time Eligible Projection (FY 21 - FY 26) Agency FY 21 FY loss of this significant portion of the workforce means the HHS agencies will lose some of their most knowledgeable workers, including many employe es in key positions. Effective succession planning and employee development will be critical in ensuring there are qualified individuals who can replace those leaving state service. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-256. Critical Workforce Skills The current climate of the information age, advances in technology, increasing population for the state, consolidation of services, right- sizing and outsourcing will continue to place increased emphasis on the demand for well -trained and skilled staff. The outsourcing and self -service automation of majo r HR functions, such as employe e selection, have made it critical for HHS managers and employees to improve and commit to a continual learning of human resource policy, employee development, conflict resolution, time management, project management and automation skills. It is important for HHS to employ professionals who have the skills necessary for the development, implementation and evaluation of the health and human services programs. These skills include: analytic/assessment skills; policy development/program planning skills; communication skills; cultural competency skills; basic public health sciences skills; financial planning and management skills; contract management skills; and leadership and systems -thinking skills. As the Spanish speaking population in Texas increases, there will be an increased need for employees with bilingual skills, especially Spanish- English proficiency. In addition, most management positions require program knowledge. As HHS continues to lose tenured staff, effective training will be needed to ensure that current employees develop the skills necessary to transfer into management positions. To promote this staff development, HHS must continue to grow the skills and talents of managers as part of a plan for succession. HHS has demonstrated this belief by establishing the HHS Leadership Academy, a formalized interagency training and mentoring program that provides opportunities to enhance the growth of high- potential managers as they take on greater responsibility in positions o f leadership. The primary goals of the academy are to: prepare managers to take on higher and broader roles and responsibilities; provide opportunities for managers to better understand critical management issues; provide opportunities for managers to participate and contribute while learning; and create a culture of collaborative leaders across the HHS system. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-26Through this planned development of management skills and the careful selection of qualified staff, HHS will continue to meet the challenges posed by increased retirements. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-277. Environmental Assessment COVID -19 In early 2020, the nation experienced both a public health emergency and an economic crisis as the novel coronavirus (COVID -19) spread across the country. The federal government declared COVID -19 a national emergency on March 13, 2020,62 and government entities at the state and local levels took measures to help stop the spread of the virus . Every state declared a state of emergency , and the majority put stay -at-home orders in place. The effects of the pandemic struck the economy almost immediately in 2020 : Over 22 million jobs were lost from February to April of that year.63 In response to the se challenges , Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (2020) on March 25, 2020. CARES provi ded direct financial assistance to families, workers, and small businesses .64 Subsequently, as positive COVID -19 cases fell across the country, consumer confidence grew and employment levels increased .65 Employment rose by 431,000 jobs in March 2022 and the unemployment rate for the country currently stands at 3.6 percent.66 The Texas Economy Texas, which had sustained years of positive job growth, and added over 250,000 jobs in 2019 ,67 lost 1.4 million jobs between February and April o f 202068 due to the initial stages of the pandemic. The unemployment rate reached a high of 12.9 percent in April 2020, but the rate dropped to 6.9 percent for the year. In 2021, the annual average unemployment rate for Texas fell to 5.7 percent . 69 Texas' e conomy began to bounce back as COVID cases decreased in 2021. Texas added approximately 657,300 jobs from June 2020 to June 2021 and by December 2021 all the jobs lost during the pandemic were recovered.70 In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas pre dicts employment to grow 3. 3 percent in 2022 .71 The Texas Leading Index rose 17 times in the last 19 months, which shows consumer confidence in spending and saving. This also suggests strong job growth in the future . 72 Poverty in Texas As the number of fami lies living in poverty increases for the state, combined with the challenges created by the pandemic, the demand for services provided by the HHS System will continue to increase. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defined the poverty level f or 2021 according to household/family size as follows: $26,500 or less for a family of four; DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-28 $21 ,960 or less for a family of three; $17,420 or less for a family of two; and $12,880 or less for individuals.73 It is estimated that 13.4 percent of Texas residents live in families with annual incomes below the poverty level. This rate is slightly higher than the national poverty rate of 11.4 percent.74 Population Growth According to the 2020 United States Census Bureau, as of July 2021, the estimated populati on of Texas was over 29 million people, which represents a 1.3 percent increase from 2020 and 15.9 percent increase from the census count in April 2010. 75 The distribution of age groups in Texas closely mirrors that of the nation, with the largest percentage of Texas residents ( 61 percent) being between ages 19 to 64, followed by those 18 and under (2 6 percent) and those 65 and over (13 percent).76 Figure 10 : Population Distribution by Age77 According to long term population projections by the Texas State Data Center, it is estimated that by 2050, Texans older than age 65 will triple in size from 2010 - 2050, approaching 8.3 million. 78 26% (Texas)61% (Texas) 13% (Texas)22% (US)62 % (US) 18 and Under 19 -64 65 and Over16% (US) DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-298. Expected Workforce Challenges HHS will need to continue to recruit and retain health and human servi ces professionals. Certain jobs will continue to be essential to the delivery of services throughout the HHS System. Many of the jobs are low paying, highly stressful and experience higher than normal turnover. Additionally, the demand for certain public health positions is expected to increase as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues . Direct Care Workers (Direct Support Professionals and Psychiatric Nursing Assistants) There are approximately 6,624 direct care workers employed within HHS. The direct care worker group is made up of direct support professionals in state supported living centers and psychiatric nursing assistants in the state hospitals. Though t hese positions require no formal education to perform the work, employees must develop interpersonal skills to effectively engage with residents and patients . The physical requirements of the position may be challenging due to the nature of the work and the pay is low.79 The overall turnover rate for employees in this group is very high, at about 5 3 percent annually.80 State supported living centers and state hospitals have historically had trouble in both recruiting and retaining these valuable workers. Direct Support Professionals at State Supported Living Centers There are 4,418 direct support professionals in state supported living centers across the state , representing approximately 18 percent of the System's total workforce.81 These employees provide 24 -hour direct care to residents in state supported living centers. They directly support these individuals by providing services including basic hygiene needs, dressing, and bathing, general health care, and dining assistance. They support life -sustaining medical care such as external feeding and lifting individuals with physical challenges. A trained and experienced direct care staff is essential to ensure resident safety, health, and well -being. There are no formal education requirements to apply for a job in this series; however, extensive on -the-job training is required. It takes six to nine months for a new direct support professional to become proficient in the basic skills necessary to carry out routine job duties. A typical HHS direct support professional is 40 years of age and has about seven years of state service. 82 Turnover for direct support professionals is over twice the state average at 55 percent, which is one of the highest turnover rates of any job category in the System . During fiscal year 2021, the System lost about 3 ,131 direct support professionals . Within this job family, entry- level Direct Support Professional Is DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-30expe rienced the highest turnover at approximately 72 percent. Turnover rates by location ranged from 38 percent at Austin State Supported Living Center to 77 percent at the San Angelo State Supported Living Center.83 84 The vacancy rate for these professionals is 35 percent, and it often takes up to five months to fill vacant positions. The State Auditor's Office (SAO) 2020 market index analysis found the average state salary for Direct Support Professional I s and IIIs to range from four to seven percent behind the market rate, contributing to challenges in recruitment.85 Psychiatric Nursing Assistants at State Hospitals There are approximately 2,206 psychiatric nursing assistants employed in HHS state hospitals across Te xas.86 Some of their daily essential job functions include assisting licensed nurses with medication administration or treatment in addition to monitoring patients' vital signs to ensure their health and safety. At times, psychiatric nursing assistants are the first to intervene during crisis situations and act as the frontline staff most likely to de-escalate situations to avoid the need for behavioral interventions . These critical positions also have a higher potential for on- the-job injuries, both from lifting requirements and intervention during crisis situations. They also may be required to work throughout the day and night. The SAO 2020 market index analysis found the average state salary for a Psychiatric Nursing Assistant I s and III s to be seven to 12 percent behind the market rate, increasing existing challenges to recruitment . 87 88 The average psychiatric nursing assistant is about 3 9 years of age and has an average of seven years of service .89 Turnover for psychiatric nursing assistants is very high at about 50 percent , reflecting the loss of 1,378 workers during fiscal year 20 21. Within this job family, Psychiatric Nursing Assistant Is experienced the highest turnover at 67 percent. Turnover rates vary by location, from 33 percent at Terrell State Ho spital to 66 percent at the Big Spring State Hospital.90 HHS is currently having trouble filling vacant psychiatric nursing assistant positions , as there are 873 vacancies in this job family. Vacant positions are going unfilled an average of four months.91 Food Service Workers HHS employs approximately 748 food service workers.92 The average hourly rate paid to food service workers is $ 11.51.93 The turnover rate for food service worker s is very high, at about 44 percent.94 The SAO 2020 market index analysis found the average state salary for Food Service Workers ranged eight to 11 percent behind the market rate ; Food Service Managers ranged from six to 15 percent behind the market rate; and Cooks ranged from nine to 11 percent behind the market rate.95 DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-31Rete ntion and recruitment of these workers remains a major challenge for the System. Food Service Workers at State Supported Living Center s There are 449 food service workers employed in HHS state supported living centers throughout Texas.96 The typical food service worker is about 46 years of age and has an average of approximately nine years of service .97 Turnover in these food service worker positions is very high, at 49 percent. By location, turnover rates range from 35 percent at Richmond State Living Center to 87 percent at Lubbock State Living Center.98 Food Service Workers at State Hospitals There are 289 food service workers employed at HHS state hospitals and centers throughout Texas.99 The typical food service worker is about 46 years of age and has an average of about eight years of service .100 Of the state hospitals with over 20 food service workers, turnover rates range from 16 percent at Rio Grande State Hospital Center to 56 percent at Rusk State Hospital. 101 Food Service Workers at Texas Center for Infectious Disease There are 10 food service workers employed in the Texas Center for Infectious Disease (TCID) .102 The typ ical food service worker is about 46 years of age and has an average of approximately seven years of service .103 At 26 percent , turnover for these food service worker positions is high and slightly above the state average of 21.5 percent .104 105 Dietetic and Nutrition Specialists There are 56 dietetic and nutrition specialists employed by HHS, with the majority (55 percent) classified as Dietetic and Nutrition Specialists IIIs .106 These specialists facilitate/direct operations of nutrition care services, serve as a member of the patient's recovery team, and plan special therapeutic menus for patients. Dietetic and nutrition specialists work in state hospitals, state supported living centers, and in Health, Developmental and Independence Services (HDIS). The typical system dietetic and nutrition specialist is 45 years of age and has nine years of service . Thirty -four percent of these specialists have 10 or more years of service . 107 The average salary for the dietetics and nutrition specialists is $57,229, which is below both the national average wage of $65,620 and Texas average wage of $64,560.108 109 DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-32Turnov er is about the same as the state average at 21 percent, which represents a total loss of 13 employees.110 111 The vacancy rate is 15 percent, and it can take over five months to fill these vacancies.112 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of dietitians and nutritionists is project ed to grow 11 percent from 2020 to 2030. This is faster than the average for all occupations.113 Dietetic and Nutrition Specialists at State Supported Living Center s There are 22 Dietetic and Nutrition Specialist IIs and IIIs at state supported living centers across Texas.114 On average, these specialists are about 45 years of age and have 10 years of service .115 The turnover rate for these dietetic and nutrition specialists is high at 17 percent (representing four total losses), with a high vacancy rate of approximately 24 percent.116 117 Dietetic and Nutrition Specialists at State Hospitals There are 13 dietetic and nutrition specialists employed in the state hospital system, which the slight majority working as Dietetic and Nutrition Specialist IIIs (seven specialists ). 118 The typical s pecialist at these facilities is about 50 years of age and has an average of nine years of service .119 Only the San Antonio State Hospital experienced turnover in the group, as they lost only one employee.

Registered Nurses Registered nurses ( RNs) constitute one of the largest healthcare occupations. With over three million jobs in the U.S., job opportunities for RNs are expected to grow nine percent from 2020 to 2030, about as fast as the average for all occupations. About 194,500 openings for registered nurses are projected each year, on average, over the decade.269 270 HHS employs approximate ly 1,581 RNs across the state.271 272 As the demand for nursing services increases, the recruitment and retention of nurses will continue to be a challenge, and the need for competitive salaries will be critical. Currently, the average annual salary for HHS Sy stem RNs is $63,856 . 273 This salary falls below both national and state averages for these occupations. Nationally, the average annual earnings for RNs in 20 20 was $ 82,750. 274 In Texas, the average annual earnings for RNs in 20 20 was $ 79,120.275 In addition, the SAO 2020 market index analysis found the average state salary for Nurse I I-IVs ranged from five to 10 percent behind the market rate and 10 percent behind the market rate for Public Health Nurse IIs.276 Posted vacant positions are currently taking about si x months to fill.277 To address these difficulties, HHS may consider requesting additional funding to increase salary levels for these positions.

With a vacancy rate of approximately 18 percent, RN positions often remain open for more than six months before being filled. Some facilities are experiencing even longer vacancy durations. At the Brenham and Denton state supported living centers, it takes about nine months to fill a vacancy. 281 Registered Nurses at State Hospitals About 41 percent of System RNs ( 649 RNs) work at state hospitals across the Texas, providing frontline medical care of patients. They provide medications, primary health care and oversee psychiatric treatment.282 System nurses at state hospitals are generally required to work varied shifts and weekends. The work requires special skills and staff often work long hours with minimal staffing. The work is also physically demanding, making it increasingly more difficult for the workforce to keep up with these work demands. All of these job factors contribute to higher- than- average turnover rates. Turnover for these RNs is considered very high at about 32 percent. Turnover is over 40 percent at the El Paso Psychiatric Center, the Rusk State Hospital, the Terrell State Hospital, and the Waco Center for Youth. 283 The typical RN at a System state hospital is about 48 years of age and has an average of approxim ately 10 years of service .284 At these state hospitals, there are always vacant nursing positions that need to be filled.

These nurses serve as consultants and advisors to county, local , and stakeholder groups, and educate communit y partners. These RNs assist in communicable disease investigation, control and prevention, and are critical to successful public health preparedness and response throughout the state. Public Health RNs have, on average , seven years of service , with an average age of 48 years. 288 DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-44Ove rall turnover for these RNs is about 19 percent.

Turnover is especially high at Rusk State Hospital (at 43 percent) and the San Antonio State Hospital at 35 percent.303 State hospitals continue to experience difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified staff which can be attributed to a shortage in the qualified labor pool. Market competition and budget limitations significantly constrain the ability of state hospitals to compete for available talent. Licensed Vocational Nurses in Public Health Roles About three percent of System LVNs (2 9 LVNs) work in the Public Health Regions across Texas.304 They have , on average, 11 years of service , with an average age of about 50 years.305 The overall turnover for these LVNs is high, at about 17 percent , though slightly below the state average rate of 21.5 percent .306 307 Retention is expected to remain an issue as employment of LVNs is projected to grow nine percent from 2020 to 2030 , about as fast as the average for all occupations . Budgetary limitations will continue to make it difficult for the System to offer competitive salaries. 308 Nurse Practitioners HHS employs 90 nurse practitioners throughout the System.309 310 Under the supervision of a physician, 51 of these nurse practitioners are responsible for providing advanced medical services and clinical care to individuals at state hospitals and those who reside in state supported living centers across Texas.311 These highly skilled employees have, on average , 10 years of service , with an average age of 49. Approximately 40 percent of these employees have 10 years or more of service .312 System nurse practitioners earn an average annual salary of $11 8,202.313 This salary falls slightly below the market rate.

These projects are expected to increase the demand for employees in positions that are already at critical shortage levels. Pharmacists HHS employ s 105 pharmacists, with an average annual salary of $ 106,766 .323 This salary falls significantly below the market rate. The average annual salary for pharmacists nationally is $ 125,690 and $ 127,320 in Texas.324 In addition, the SAO 2020 market index analysis found the average state salary for Pharmacist Is 15 percent behind the market rate , and Pharmacist IIs at five percent behind the market rate .325 This disparity is affecting the System's ability to recruit qualified applicants for open positions. Pharmacist positions often remain unfilled for over three months .326 Though p harmacist turnover is only moderately high at 14 percent, a significant numb er of p harmacists are nearing retirement age (or have already retired and returned to work), and over 20 percent will be eligible to retire in the next five years.327 328 Recruitment and retention of these highly skilled employees will continue to be a problem for the System. Pharmacists at State Supported Living Centers About 45 percent of System p harmacists (47 employees) work at HHS state supported living centers. The typical pharmacist at these facilities is about 47 years of age and has an average of seven years of service .329 Turnover for these p harmacists is currently moderately high at about 12 percent, though some Centers are experiencing much higher turnover, including the Lufkin State Supported Living Center at 75 percent and the Abilene State Supported Living Center at 25 percent. 330 HHS may face significant recruitment challenges in the next few years to retain these highly skilled employees who will be eligible for retirement.

These highly skilled employees are essential to the timely filling of prescribed medicatio ns for patients in state hospitals . The majority of these employees are in Pharmacist II positions ( 23 employees or 70 percent).332 These p harmacists play a key role in the monitoring of costs and inventory of medications, and in the ongoing monitoring of i n-patients' medication histories, needs and potential adverse drug issues. They provide important clinical consultation to psychiatrists and physicians regarding complex medical and psychiatric conditions that may be intractable to traditional medication treatment interventions. The typical pharmacist at a state hospital is about 48 years of age and has an average of 1 0 years of service . About 39 percent of these employees have 1 0 or more years of service. 333 Turnover for these p harmacists is currently high at about 22 percent, with positions often remaining unfilled for nearly four months before being filled.334 335 Some state hospitals are experiencing much higher turnover. With 22 percent of these pharmacists currently eligible to retire, and 38 percent eligible to retire in the next five years, HHS will need to develop creative recruitment strategies to replace these skilled and highly tenured employees . 336 Pharmacy Technicians There are 73 pharmacy technicians in HHS, with the majority (99 percent ) employed in state hospitals and state supported living centers across the state.337 These employees assist pharmacists in various technical aspects of preparation of non-routine medication orders for passes, furloughs and discharges .

Big Springs State Hospital experienced one of the highest turnover rates at 73 percent.349 The vacancy rate for these positions is high, at about 18 percent, with positions often remaining unfilled for over five months .350 HHS may face significant recruitment challenges in the next few years, as 16 percent of these employees will be eligible for retirement in the next five years.351 Dentists at State Supported Living Centers The demand for dentists nationwide is expected to increase as the overall population ages. Employment of dentists is projected to grow by eight percent through 20 30.352 The Syst em employs a total of 30 dentists across the state.353 Of the 30 dentists employed by the System, a little over half (5 3 percent) provide advanced dental care and treatment for residents living at the HHS supported living centers across Texas. The typical dentist at these facilities is about 5 5 years of age and has an average of 12 years of service .354 Facility dentists earn an average salary of $143,074, which is below the national average wage of $167,160, and lower than the Texas average wage of $150,060.355 356 Turnover for these dentists is high at about 27 percent.357 State supported living centers face challenges competing with private sector salaries to fill current vacancies. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-49It i s anticipated that HHS will face significant recruitment challenges in the next few years to replace these highly skilled employees who will be eligible for retirement. About 19 percent of these employees are currently eligible to retire, and this number will increase to about 38 percent in the next five y ears.358 Dental Assistants There are 21 Dental Assistant Is and IIs working in the state hospitals and state supported living centers , with IIs make up 86 percent of the total.359 These assistants prepare treatment areas, assist dentists with instrumentation, and instruct staff, guardians, or patients regarding treatment and hygiene. Dental assistants have, on average, 11 years of service , with an average age of 47 years of age . Over 76 percent have five or more years of service .360 Dental assistants make an average salary of $30,727, which is below the national wage of $42,510 and state wage of $38,370 average salaries.361 Turnover for dental assistants is much lower than the state av erage , at only nine percent.362 363 There were no vacancies for dental assistants in fiscal year 2021.364 Nineteen percent of dental assistants are eligible to retire this year, and over 29 percent will be eligible to retire in five years.365 Physicians There are currently about 256,670 active physicians across the country.366 HHS employs 95 physicians, with 71 percent employed in HHS state supported living centers, state hospitals.367 These highly skilled employees have, on average, nine years of service , with an average age of 57. About 37 percent of these employees have 10 years or more of service .368 System physicians are currently earning an average annual salary of $1 94,982.369 This salary is below the average nationally wage of $231,500 and lower than the Texas average wage of $237,890 .370 The SAO 2020 market index analysis found the average state salary for Physicians to be six to 10 percent behind the market rate.371 Turnover for these physicians is currently moderately high at 13 percent , though positions are remaining vacant for an average of more than six months.372 373 About 17 percent of these hig hly skilled and tenured employees are currently eligible to retire, with this number increasing to 37 percent in the next five years.374 Physicians at State Supported Living Centers There are 41 physicians working at state supported living centers across Tex as.375 Full staffing of these positions is critical to direct- care services. These physicians have, on average, eight years of service , with an average age of 58.376 Local physicians who have established long term private practices often apply DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-50as a staff physician at state supported living centers late in their career to s ecure retirement and insurance benefits, thus explaining the reason for the high average age. Turnover for these physicians is moderately high at 14 percent.377 To meet the health needs of individuals residing in state supported living centers, it is critical that HHS recruit and retain qualified physicians. However, due to the short supply and large demand, state supported living centers are experiencing difficulty hiring physicians, with positi ons remaining unfilled for an average of almost seven months.378 Physicians at State Hospitals There are currently 26 physicians at HHS who are providing essential medical care in state hospitals.379 They take the lead role in diagnosing, determining a course of treatment, making referrals to outside medical hospitals, prescribing medications and monitoring the patients' progress toward discharge. Physician services in state hospitals are essential to the ongoing monitoring and management of an increasing numbe r of complex chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, seizure disorders, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These employees are critical to the System's preparedness and response to medical services provided by the state and to major public health initiatives, such as obesity prevention, diabetes, disease outbreak control and others. These physicians have, on average, 13 years of service , with an average age of about 57. Local physicians who have established long term private practices often apply as physicians at state hospitals late in their working career to secure retirement and insurance benefits, contributing to the high overall age. More than 40 percent of the full-time physicians are 50 years of age or older. 380 Turnove r for these physicians is currently low at eight percent, though it takes about nine months to fill a state hospital physician position with someone who has appropriate skills and expertise.381 382 In addition, HHS may face significant challenges in the next few years to replace those employees who are eligible for retirement. About 31 percent of these highly skilled and tenured employees are currently eligible to retire. Within five years, about 46 percent will be eligible to retire.383 If these employees choose to retire, HHS will lose some of the most experienced medical personnel - those with institutional knowledge and skills that will be difficult to match and even harder to recruit. Psychiatrists There are currently about 2 5,520 psychiatrists nationwide .384 A 4.5 percent decrease is projected in the state government sector by 20 30.385 HHS employs 121 psychiatrists throughout the System, with about 8 4 percent employed in state hospitals across Texas.386 DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-51Thes e highly skilled and tenured employees have, on average, 12 years of service , with an average age of 5 3.387 System psychiatrists currently earn an average annual salary of $2 47,565 .388 The SAO 2020 market index analysis found the average state salary for Psychiatrist IIs and IVs ranged from 14 to 10 percent behind the market rate.389 Turnover for System psychiatrists is currently at about 11 percent.390 The vacancy rate is high at about 20 percent, wi th positions remaining vacant for an average of seven months.391 About 2 3 percent of these highly skilled and tenured employe es are currently eligible to retire, with this number increasing to 34 percent in the next five years.392 Psychiatrists at State Supported Living Centers There are 1 6 psychiatrists assigned to state supported living centers.393 Full staffing of these positions is critical to providing psychiatric services needed by residents.

Recruiting and retaining psychiatrists at the state hospitals has been especially difficult for HHS. These psychiatrists have, on average, 13 years of service , with an average ag e of 53. About 5 3 percent of these employees have 10 or more years of service.397 Annual turnover for these psychiatrists is currently well -managed at about 10 percent, although much higher rates were reported for Big Springs State Hospital at 42 percent and 19 percent for North Texas State Hospital .398 With an overall high vacancy rate of about 20 percent, most vacant psychiatrist positions go unfilled for over seven months.399 These challenges are expected to continue, as about 2 6 percent of these highly skilled and tenured employees are currently eligible to retire and may leave at any time. Within five years, this number will increase to 35 percent. 400 State hospitals continue to face increasing difficulty in recruiting qualified psychiatrists as salaries are not competitive with the private sector, and there is a general shortage of a qualified labor pool . Due to the complex medical and mental challenges that individuals residing in state hospitals exhibit, it is critical that HHS is able to effectively recruit and retain qualified psychiatrists. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-52Psychologists There are 43 psycholo gists in HHS, with 72 percent employed in state hospitals across the state.401 System psychologists earn an average annual salary of $ 84,883 .402 This salary falls below the market rate.

They also provide testing and evaluation services important to ongoing treatment, such as the administration of IQ, mood, and neurological testing instruments. These highly skilled and tenured employees have, on average, 1 1 years of service , with an average age of 51. 407 Turnover for these psychologists is very high at about 36 percent . Rio Grande State Center experienced the highest turnover at 80 percent.408 The vacancy rate for these positions is very high, at about 34 percent, with positions often remaining unfilled for over six months .409 HHS may face significant recruitment challenges in the next few years, as 13 percent of these highly skilled and tenured employees are currently eligible for retirement and may leave HHS at any time.410 Behavioral Health Specialists There are 130 behavioral health specialists within HHS.411 These specialists are employed at state supported living centers across the state, providing behavior support services, including behavior observations, data analysis, training of behavioral interventions, and the modeling of behavior support.

They participate in Program Recovery Teams, with duties of coordinating recovery planning. On average, HHS mental health specialists are 41 years of age and have about eight years of service . About 21 percent of these employees have 10 or more yea rs of service .417 The turnover rate for HHS mental health specialists is high at about 21 percent, reflecting the loss of about eight specialists during fiscal year 2021. Turnover rates by location ranged from 0 percent at the Austin State Hospital to 45 percent at the North Texas State Hospital.418 With a very high vacancy rate of 31 percent, vacant positions often go unfilled for more than six months. 419 With 18 percent of these employees eligible to retire in the next five years, HHS will need to develop creative recruitment strategies to replace these skille d employees.420 Epidemiologists HHS employs 127 epidemiologists who provide services in the areas of infectious disease and injury control, chronic disease control, emergency and disaster preparedness, disease surveillance and other public health areas.421 They provide critical functions during disasters and pandemics and other preparedness and response planning. As of May 20 21, there were approximately 8,180 epidemiologist jobs in the U.S., with a projected job growth rate of 10 percent by 2030. 422 On average, System epidemiologists have about six years of service , with an average age of approximately 3 5 years.423 DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-54Turnov er for System epidemiologists is currently high at about 19 percent. This rate is much higher for experienced Epidemiologist I IIs, at about 2 2 percent.424 Low pay is a contributing factor in the inability to attract qualified epidemiologist applicants. System epidemiologists are currently earning an average annual salary of $60,312.425 This salary is significantly below the average national wage of $86,740 , and also lower than the Texas average wage of $82,810.426 In addition, the SAO 2020 market index analysis found that the average state salary for epidemiologists range from 11 percent ( for Epidemiologist Is) to 12 percent (for Epidemiologist III s) behind the market rate.427 Currently, only about seven percent of these employees are eligible to retire and this rate will increase in the next five years to 16 percent.428 Surveillance functions involving preparedness, response and monitoring will need more qualified public health professionals i.e. , Epidemiologists. Emerging threats will require continuous and agile learning for Epidemiologists in areas such as disease prevention and population he alth. HHS will need to closely monitor this occupation due to the nationally non- competitive salaries and a general shortage of professionals performing this work. Sanitarians There are 126 sanitarians employed with HHS, with 73 percent employed within the DSHS Division fo r Consumer Protection.429 HHS registered sanitarians inspect all food manufacturers, wholesale food distributors, food salvagers in Texas, as well as all retail establishments in the 188 counties not covered by local health jurisd ictions and conduct a multitude of environmental inspections such as children's camps, asbestos abatement, hazardous chemicals/products and many others. Sanitarians are instrumental in protecting the citizens of Texas from food -borne illness and many dangerous environmental situations and consumer products, including imported foods, drugs and consumer products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) have little manpower and therefore depend on the state programs to protect citize ns. System sanitarians also respond to a variety of emergencies, including truck wrecks, fires, tornados, floods , and hurricanes. They are the first line of defense against a bioterrorist attack on the food supply. On average, HHS sanitarians are 4 4 years of age and have about 11 years of service . About 44 percent of these employees have 10 or more years of service. 430 Though the turnover rate for HHS sanitarians is currently low at about nine percent, HHS has experienced difficulty filling vacant positions, with vacant positions often going unfilled for over seven months due to a shortage of qualified applicants available for work .431 432 Historically, HHS has faced special challenges filling vacancies in both rural and urban areas of the state. In addition, the state requirement for sanitarians to be registered and have at least 30 semester hours of science (in addition to 18 hours DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II F-55of continuing education units annually) has made it increasingly difficult to find qualified individuals. With 1 4 percent of sanitarians currently eligible to retire, and 2 1 percent eligible to retire in the next five years, HHS will need to develop creative recruitment strategies to replace these skilled and highly tenured employees.433 Health Physicists Within DSHS, there are 51 health physicists, all employed within the Consumer Protection Division.434 These employees p lan and conduct complex and highly advanced technical inspections and license application review of radioactive material, nuclear medicine, industrial x -ray units, general medical diagnostic x -ray units, fluoroscopic units, mammographic units, C -Arm units, radiation therapy equipment, laser equipment, and industrial and medical radioactive materials to assure user's compliance with applicable State and Federal regulations.

DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II G-1Schedule H: Report on Customer Service The DSHS 2022 Report on Customer Service, found on the following pages, was compiled by the DSHS Center for System Coordination and Innovation, in compliance with the Texas Government Code Section 2114.002. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II H-1Introduction This \"2022 Report on Customer Service\" is prepared in response to \u00a72114.002 of the Government Code, which requires that Texas state agencies biennially submit information gathered from customers about the quality of agency services to the Office of the Governor's (OOG) Budget and Policy Team and the Legislative Budget Board (LBB). This report reflects the combined efforts of the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) divisions during the State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020 and SFY 2021 reporting period (September 2019 to August 2021). The DSHS mission is \"To improve the health, safety, and well-being of Texans through good stewardship of public resources, and a focus on core public health functions.\" In pursuit of this mission, DSHS divisions administer a wide array of surveys to assess the quality of DSHS services. This report includes results of DSHS surveys that examine customer satisfaction in various programs. DSHS divisions use survey feedback to help improve customer service for individuals served in those programs. DSHS divisions and programs independently conduct surveys that include questions about customer satisfaction with specific agency programs and services. This report presents descriptions and major findings from the following surveys: Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) Systems Development Group Case Management and Family Supports and Community Resources Family Satisfaction Surveys Business Filing and Verification Section - Customer Service Satisfaction Survey Surveillance Section - Customer Service Satisfaction Survey Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Care Services Ryan White Part B - Post Monitoring Satisfaction Survey Laboratory Services Testing - Customer Satisfaction Survey South Texas Laboratory - Water Sample Testing Survey Overall, DSHS obtained feedback from a diverse group of customers. However, given the multitude of programs operated and customer groups served, it is possible this report only reflects a subset of all customers served in DSHS. Still, most respondents provided positive feedback regarding the services and supports they received, while a small percentage offered opportunities for improvement. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II H-2Department of State Health Services DSHS conducted six surveys during SFY 20 20 and SFY 20 21 that collected customer satisfaction data . More than 2,600 responses were received through these surveys , primarily from families of children with special health care needs . For readabili ty, this chapter is organiz ed into three sections : Community Health Improvement CSHCN Systems Development Group Case Management and Family Supports and Community Resources Family Satisfaction Surveys Consumer Protection Division Business Filing and Verific ation Section - Customer Se rvice Satisfaction Survey Surveillance Section Customer Service Satisfaction Survey Laboratory and Infectious Disease Human Immunodeficiency Virus Care Services Ryan White Part -B, Post Monitoring Satisfaction Survey Laboratory Se rvices Testing Customer Satisfaction Survey South Texas Laboratory - Water Sample Testing Survey Community Health Improvement CSHCN Systems Development Group Case Management and Family Supports and Community Resources Family Satisfaction Surveys Purpose The CSHCN System s Development Group (SDG) serves children ages 0 to 21 with special health care needs. The program works to strengthen community -based services to improve systems of care for children and youth with special health care needs by funding organ izations across Texas through two different contracts: Case DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II H-3Management (CASE) and Family Support and Community Resources (FSCR). CASE contractors work in partnership with children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) and their families to asse ss needs, devel op service plans, provide linkages to state and local resources, and coordinate care. FSCR contractors help CYSHCN and their families by providing a wide range of services and activities in response to community needs. Services and activitie s include respi te assistance, educational workshops, recreational and fitness programs, parent to parent networking, and crisis prevention. In the first quarter of SFY 2020, CSHCN SDG developed separate FSCR and CASE family experience surveys to better as sess each contr actor program. Previously, the survey was the same for both contracts. The new FSCR family experience survey gauges contractor responsiveness to family inquiries, respect for culture and traditions, quality of linkages to needed resources, f acilitation of parent -to-parent connections, and support in helping families feel included in the community. Additionally, the CASE survey measures family satisfaction with service plan development, emergency preparedness planning, timeliness of follow -up, and shared dec ision-making for their child. Sample and Method s The CSHCN FSCR and CASE Family Satisfaction Surveys were distributed during two separate time periods , one for SFY 2020 and one for SFY 2021 . CSHCN SDG contractors sought responses from all f amilies served by their organization with CSHCN SDG funding. All families served were provided a survey at least once during the contract year. Paper and online surveys were offered in both English and Spani sh. To ensure distribution, the CSHCN SDG sent ea ch contractor printed surveys, return envelopes, and links to the online surveys. Individuals who completed a paper survey sent their response via postal mail to DSHS. In SFY 2020, there were 558 completed FSCR responses out of 4,715 surveys distributed b y the CSHCN SDG contractors (11.8 percent response rate). There were 116 completed CASE responses out of 1,004 surveys distributed by CSHCN SDG contractors (11.6 percent response rate). In SFY 2021, there we re 847 completed FSCR responses out of 4,687 surv eys distributed by the CSHCN SDG contractors (18.1 percent response rate). There were 146 completed CASE responses out of 1,077 surveys distributed by CSHCN SDG contractors (13.5 percent response rate).

Laboratory Services Testing Customer Satisfaction Survey Purpose The DSHS Laboratory Services Section (LSS) provides unique testing services for a myriad of sample types and facilities across the state. Services include testing newbo rn blood samples for inherited, potentially deadly disorders ; testing water quality for biologic contaminants from local sources ; and testing milk and meat. LSS's goal is to improve the public health and patient outcomes for all Texans and serve thousands of facilities across the state that submit samples to the laboratory. The purpose of the DSHS LSS Survey was to allow laboratory m anagement to gauge client satisfaction with the type of services provided, ease of use with electronic reporting systems, and experience with customer support services. The goal is to improve client satisfaction. Surveys were conducted annually by the LSS Quality Assurance Unit and included all facilities that received LSS services from 2019 through 2020. DSHS Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, Part II H-18Sample and Methods DSHS LSS issued a survey for services rendered in 2019 and 2020 with surveys issued the following year, 2020 and 2021 respectively. Facilities were made aware of the survey opportunities through notices placed on results web portals, issued via GovDelivery o r ListServ, email, and the DSHS website. The responses could be completed electronically by facility representatives for 30 days. T he 2020 DSHS LSS Survey closed February 28, 2020 and the 2021 DSHS LSS Survey closed on April 15, 2021. The surveys were offe red in English and were available online only. Performance Metrics Table 16 provides output measures for the DSHS LSS Survey . The number of customers who received access to the survey (26,323) is much larger than the number of customers served in the progr am for several reasons : The laboratory openly advertises to everyone via the laboratory websi te, online portals, and email distribution lists. The website can be seen by everyone, including the general public. Online portals are actively seen by a subset o f active submitters (not all submitters use the online portals). The email distribution lists are open to anyone who takes the time to subscribe. The laboratory maintains seven email distribution lists and took count of the number of email addresses part o f each distribution list to arrive at 26,323. For every active submitting entity, many suppor ting staff members interact with the laboratory on a regular or sporadic basis. Each submitting entity, whether it be a clinic, hospital or individual, has support ing staff including administrative, nurses, techs, etc. In the cases of hospitals and clinics , their support staff, all those who work for the submitting doctor/hospital/clinic/etc., can be large and often siloed. For instance, techs sending out specimens are in a different area from those attaching results to patient records, etc. Each has a port ion of the job to ensure their patients are taken care of. Each has its own experiences when interacting with the laboratory. To get the information to the staff t hat needs it, the laboratory maintains email distribution lists that send out periodic alerts , reminders, etc. Customers, including all support staff, can sign up to be on any email distribution list available.
