For some people, a Hepatitis B or [Hepatitis C infection](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-c) goes away on its own, but in other cases, it can cause serious liver damage, leading to chronic liver disease. Acupuncture and TCM treatment, including Chinese herbs, offer a way to [help improve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229916300759) liver function and reduce symptoms of Hepatitis. There are several variants of the Hepatitis virus that can cause inflammation of the liver, leading to scarring (liver cirrhosis or liver fibrosis), and in some cases leading to chronic liver problems or liver cancer. Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hep C (HCV) are the types of infection that can lead to long-term illness and even liver failure. It is estimated that over [300 million people worldwide](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1) are living with the effects of HBV or HCV infections. There is a vaccination that offers protection against Hepatitis B and Hepatitis A, but there is no vaccine for Hepatitis types C, D, and E. People who have contracted Hepatitis A or an acute form of HBV are usually told to rest and drink lots of fluids. Medical treatment for chronic Hepatitis that lasts for more than six months usually involves antiviral medications that help slow down the spread of the virus through the body. [TCM treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22083981/) for Hepatitis with acupuncture and herbs works to [improve the function of the liver](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-detox-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and related organs (spleen, kidneys, gallbladder) and to strengthen the immune system so that the body can overcome the effects of the Hepatitis virus. What Causes Hepatitis? There are currently five different types of Hepatitis infection, referred to as: Hepatitis A, [Hepatitis B virus (HBV)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802), Hepatitis C (HCV or Hep C), Hepatitis D, and Hepatitis E. All of these viral infections affect the liver, causing inflammation and possibly scarring, known as cirrhosis of the liver or fibrosis of the liver. Hepatitis A and E viruses are carried in contaminated water or food supplies. People might contract the Hep A or Hep E virus through eating something like raw shellfish that was in contaminated water, or eating food prepared by a worker who did not wash their hands properly. These variants of Hepatitis may cause an acute infection, but do not lead to chronic conditions. [HBV](https://www.hepb.org/what-is-hepatitis-b/the-abcs-of-viral-hepatitis/) and HCV are spread through bodily fluids like blood and semen, and can therefore be spread through sexual contact, or the sharing of needles, or a woman may pass the infection to her baby during birth. Hepatitis is a common co-infection in [people living with HIV/AIDS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hiv-aids-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). People with [Cystic Fibrosis (CF)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-cystic-fibrosis-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) can also be more prone to infections and liver problems. These more serious forms of Hepatitis can lead to chronic illness, including cancer of the liver, or liver failure, making it one of the primary reasons people end up having a liver transplant. Top 10 Symptoms of Hepatitis Symptoms of a HBV or Hepatitis C infection often do not show up for a few weeks, a few months, or in some cases, years later. Some people, especially children, do not feel any symptoms of Hepatitis. The most common Hepatitis symptoms include: - Abdominal pain, pain in right side - Swelling in liver area, swollen belly (ascites - fluid buildup in the liver) - Jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin - Dark urine, pee is dark - Light colored stools, poop is clay-colored - Fatigue - Nausea - Fever - Loss of appetite - Joint pain Bleeding easily or bruising easily are also potentially [signs of Hep C](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/hepatitis-c-skin-problems), as is a skin rash, or itchy skin (pruritus), little blisters, or itchy patches of skin like psoriasis. Some people have a sensation of their internal organs itching. What Is the Treatment for Hepatitis? If a person shows high levels of liver enzymes and still has the Hepatitis B virus in their body after six months or more, they will often be prescribed medications aimed to slow the spread of the virus and prevent further damage to the liver. There are several types of [antiviral medications](https://www.hepb.org/treatment-and-management/treatment/approved-drugs-for-adults/) used to treat patients with long-term effects of Hepatitis, some of them are pills (adefovir, entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir) that are taken daily for a year, or for several years. Some, known as Interferons, are given as an injection a few times a week over the course of several months or more. These medications can slow the virus in some patients, but for some people, they may not do much to protect the body from liver damage or stop the virus from spreading. These medications can cause serious side effects, including headaches, dizziness, fever, and severe depression. Acupuncture and TCM methods offer an alternative or adjunct support to help promote better liver function and boost the body's defense against the Hepatitis virus. What Acupuncture and TCM Can Do for Hepatitis Hepatitis infection is closely associated with the liver, as it is the liver that shows the most obvious damage as a result of infection, often resulting in cirrhosis or scarring of the liver. But according to TCM philosophy, the other internal organs work in concert with the liver, helping it to do the job of cleaning the blood and supplying it to the rest of the body. Patients with chronic Hepatitis B infection will demonstrate symptoms that help the acupuncture practitioner recognize a particular syndrome pattern, allowing them to use acupuncture points and Chinese herbs to work on deficiencies in the liver and other organs. In [TCM theory, Hepatitis](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Chinese+Traditional+Medicine+for+Hepatitis+C) infection occurs due to pathogenic forces of toxic Heat and Dampness invading the body. The infection moves through different stages, and the TCM provider will tailor treatment with herbs, acupuncture, and moxibustion to the [stage of infection](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2018/7482593/) and specific pattern of symptoms. TCM differentiations of Hepatitis include: - Liver Qi stagnation - causes symptoms like nausea, poor appetite, distension of the belly or [bloated stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Spleen and/or Kidney Yang deficiency - associated with poor appetite, loose stools, sallow complexion, weakness, loss of muscle - Liver - Gallbladder Dampness and Heat - causes jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), fever, nausea - Liver - Kidney Yin Deficiency - indicated (tinnitus)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/) - Blood stasis - accumulation of blood in the liver contributes to fibrosis or cirrhosis, also causes pain in the lower rib area, [menstrual problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [PMS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). A person may be more susceptible to getting Hepatitis because of some underlying deficiencies in their Qi, and/or the virus may cause those deficiencies to manifest. The main goal of acupuncture treatment for HBV or HCV, therefore, is to strengthen the liver, spleen, and kidneys, to clear any dampness or excess heat from these organs, and to increase the circulation of blood through the systems. Traditional Chinese herb formulations have been shown in [clinical trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229916300759) to help improve liver function in patients with chronic Hepatitis B. [Herbs that help](https://www.asiabiotech.com/01/0105/0124_0124.pdf) improve spleen function are believed to help rid the body of the virus and allow for healing of the liver. Diet and nutrition are, naturally, also very important in helping to strengthen and detoxify the liver and other organs. Your TCM practitioner will go far beyond the usual advice (drink fluids, avoid alcohol), and will give you specific advice for a [hepatitis diet](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Acupuncture+and+Diet+for+Hepatitis+B) plan. Acupuncture Near Me for Hepatitis in West LA Chronic Hepatitis B and Hep C infections can be difficult to treat. Using acupuncture and herbs as an adjunct to conventional antiviral therapy for HBV may help to prevent further damage to the liver and improve organ function so that patients can recover from a chronic viral infection more fully. At Art of Wellness, we have over 30 years of experience providing integrative care for those suffering from chronic illnesses of all kinds. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

Therefore acupuncture and Chinese herbs are often not supported by double-blind, randomized trials, and they are considered alternative medicine therapies in the United States. [ How to Treat Toothaches With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Sharp tooth pain, toothache, or throbbing pain in teeth usually means you need to see the dentist. The pain of dental work often necessitates the use of anesthetics, while post-operative pain from dental surgery is usually treated with over the counter pain medications or opioid painkillers. Acupuncture offers an alternative way of [dealing with dental pain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29231508/) and can also [relieve the dental anxiety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1876382018300544) many people experience when they have to have dental work done. Oral pain makes it hard to eat, hard to talk, hard to even think straight. Mouth pain felt in relation to problems with the teeth, or a hurting tooth, is often nerve pain that may be sharp in one place, or radiate to other parts of your face and head. Acupuncture acts upon the neurotransmitters that carry signals between parts of the body and the brain, helping to block pain sensations and relieving tooth pain. Different types of mouth pain, not necessarily related to dental problems or the teeth, can also be alleviated by acupuncture, including [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), clicking or locking of the jaw, tension from grinding teeth, and dry mouth (xerostomia). Myofascial pain, pain in the muscles of the face, and [migraines](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) that cause pain in the neck and side of the head can also be helped with acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture and herbs do not replace the need for regular dental visits or necessary dental procedures. However, [TCM methods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270142/), used in conjunction with good oral hygiene, can help to promote the development of strong teeth in children, and the maintenance of healthy teeth and gums in adults. TCM treatments help improve immune function, as well, which can help prevent mouth infections. While dentists have a variety of anesthetics they can use to help reduce pain during dental procedures, many people find the injection of anesthetic to be painful and anxiety-inducing in and of itself. There are definitely downsides to the pain relief offered during dental visits, so much so that many people avoid going to the dentist, or at the very least wish there was some alternative form of anesthesia. Recently, there is [growing interest and research](https://www.dentistrytoday.com/news/todays-dental-news/item/1847-acupuncture-explored-as-an-alternative-dental-treatment) to show that acupuncture can be an effective means of [providing pain relief](https://medcraveonline.com/JDHODT/evaluation-of-acupressure-effect-on-reducing-the-need-for-dental-injection-in-fixed-prosthodontics.html) before, during, and after dental procedures. It is estimated that up to 30% of people report feeling dental anxiety, while about 10% of patients experience dental phobia. [Acupuncture has been shown](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/FullText/2007/02000/Auricular_Acupuncture_for_Dental_Anxiety__A.13.aspx) to help produce a clinically significant decrease in feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/anxiety/) or fear of going to the dentist. Managing Dental Pain It is common to experience pain while you are waiting to get into the dentist for a toothache caused by a broken filling or because a crown has fallen out. Most dental pain is [usually managed](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/dental-anesthesia#side-effects) with non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), also known as OTC pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. However, some people cannot tolerate the regular use of these medicines, as they can cause damage to the lining of the stomach. Different types of anesthesia used during dental work include: - local anesthetics (lidocaine, articaine, etc.), which numb the area where a tooth is being worked on - sedation (nitrous oxide gas, Valium, Versed, etc.), which helps relax the patient - general anesthesia, which means a patient is rendered unconscious for the duration of the dental procedure Pain after oral surgery is most often treated with over the counter analgesics like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, but severe dental pain may be treated with [opioid](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/opioids/more-info) painkillers. Dentists in the U.S. are far [more likely](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2734067) to prescribe opioid pain medications than they do in other countries. Dentists are also more likely to prescribe long-acting opioids, and to prescribe opioids for a longer period of time. The growing numbers of people addicted to opioids in America is largely [due to over-prescription](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(19)30527-6/fulltext) of these drugs. [TCM methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/4800704) like acupuncture can relieve a toothache and reduce post-operative pain and bleeding without side effects or risk of dependence. Can Acupuncture Help Tooth Pain? Acupuncture treatment has an analgesic effect, reducing pain and inflammation of all kinds. Acupuncture not only offers natural pain relief for toothache, but can also help [reduce bleeding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29231508/) during dental procedures such as tooth extractions. A [controlled study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/2036-acupuncture-stops-dental-surgery-pain-and-bleeding) that compared two groups of patients have teeth extracted, one group treated with articaine hydrochloride injections and the other groups treated with acupuncture needles, found that pain relief was comparable between the anesthesia and acupuncture groups, while bleeding was less amongst those patients given acupuncture. In addition to helping with pain and bleeding during and after a dental procedure, many people find it helpful to come in and have an acupuncture treatment just prior to their dental appointment in order to help alleviate anxiety. Acupuncture may also help to reduce a person's gag reflex, which can be easily triggered during fittings for orthodontic devices, or impressions. With acupuncture treatment, we can also effectively treat dental [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), allowing for patients to feel more relaxed going into their dental appointment and feel less pain during and after a dental procedure. Top 3 Pressure Points to Help Tooth Pain [Acupressure](https://www.healthline.com/health/pressure-point-for-toothache#the-pressure-points) has been shown to help reduce anxiety, gag reflex, and the [need for dental injections](https://medcraveonline.com/JDHODT/evaluation-of-acupressure-effect-on-reducing-the-need-for-dental-injection-in-fixed-prosthodontics.html) for pain during fittings for prosthetics. Specific [points on the head](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) and face, in particular, can help relieve toothache and swelling. If you are experiencing acute tooth pain, plan to see your dentist as soon as possible. In the meantime, using these [acupressure points](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/pressure-points-for-toothache#best-pressure-points) for toothaches can help you stay calm and alleviate the pain until you can get treatment. - ST6, Stomach Meridian Point 6, is located in the cheek, equidistant between the corner of the mouth and the earlobe. Apply pressure to the jaw muscle here to help relieve toothache and jaw pain. - SI18, Small Intestine Meridian Point 18, is right in the cheek hollow, perpendicular to the corner of the eye and outside of the nose. Apply pressure to this point to help relieve tooth pain and swollen gums. - LI4, Large Intestine Meridian Point 4, is located in the webbing between the thumb and index finger. Squeeze with firm pressure here. Often used to relieve headaches, but this point helps tooth pain, as well. Acupuncture Near Me for Tooth Pain on the Westside of Los Angeles No one likes going to the dentist. However, if you have a hurting tooth but you've been avoiding the dentist out of fear, or if you know you have to have some major work done, and you are dreading it, please consider scheduling an acupuncture appointment before your next dentist appointment. Discover for yourself how acupuncture can help relieve dental anxiety and post-procedural dental pain. You may find you feel much more relaxed about the whole thing, and herbs and acupuncture can help staunch bleeding and speed recovery after dental work. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat UTI With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Why do I feel like I have to pee all the time? A urinary tract infection, usually referred to as UTI, is a bacterial infection that affects the bladder and/or other parts of the urinary system, causing urinary urgency, often accompanied by a burning pain when you go to the bathroom. [Acupuncture and TCM](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=28133) is a good way to get to the root causes of [frequent urination](https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/frequent-urination/basics/causes/sym-20050712), including [recurrent UTIs](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.16315). Urinary frequency, or an unusual urgency to urinate, can be caused by several different health conditions. A common cause of bladder pain, pressure on the bladder, or a burning sensation when peeing is a bacterial infection in the urinary tract, or UTI. But there can be many other reasons for constantly feeling like you have to pee, including [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), interstitial cystitis (IC), pregnancy, prostate problems, [ovarian cysts](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and more. Over half of all adult women have experienced a UTI (also called cystitis) at some point in their lives. Many [women get UTIs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502976/) frequently, making them the most common type of non-hospital-related infection in the U.S. Up to 6% of all doctor visits are related to UTIs. A UTI can occur when bacteria, usually E. coli, gets into the urethra and travels up into the bladder, or further into the urinary tract. This can happen because of hygiene habits, after sex or exercising, or the use of contraceptives or period products. It can also happen when urine sits in the bladder for too long, or because a person has a weakened immune system. While UTI treatment at home remedies such as drinking cranberry juice are popular, most women recognize that once they get that constant urge to pee, they have no choice but to rush to the doctor for antibiotics. Typical [UTI medical treatment](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353453) almost always involves confirming the infection by lab analysis, and a prescribed course of antibiotics, along with analgesic medicine (such as Pyridium) to help the UTI pain in bladder. Unfortunately, many women keep getting UTIs. Infections that are [antibiotic resistant](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/antibiotic-resistant-urinary-tract-infections-are-on-the-rise-2019101417982) are increasingly common, and antibiotics do not get to the root of the problem. [Interstitial cystitis (IC)](https://www.ichelp.org/about-ic/causes-of-ic/), or [painful bladder syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-interstitial-cystitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), is a condition that causes a constant sensation of having to pee, or bladder pressure, even when there is no infection present. Recurrent UTI and IC are a significant source of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) for women, as they can cause almost constant pain and an inability to leave the house due to the constant urge to urinate. UTI in men is not as common as UTI in women. The more common cause of frequent urination in men is [benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), in which an enlarged prostate presses on the urinary organs, blocking the flow of urine, and causing backup that can lead to bacterial [urinary tract infection men](https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/urinary-tract-infection-in-men-a-to-z). Sometimes what feels like a UTI might be something else. Growths in the pelvic area, such as ovarian cysts, [uterine fibroids](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or tumors can cause pressure in the bladder, bladder pain, or urinary frequency at night. Even when there is no infection, there may urinary symptoms such as: - Strong urge to pee frequently (more than 8 times per day) - Difficulty urinating - Urine is different color than usual - Pain during peeing, or burning sensation when peeing - Nocturia, frequent urination at night The conventional medicine answer to UTI is antibiotic treatment, but this is not the only answer for everyone. TCM methods of acupuncture and herbs can help with improving the function of bladder and kidney systems, reducing symptoms from recurrent UTIs, as well as helping to address the deeper problems that cause inflammation and pressure in the bladder. Top 10 Urinary Frequency Causes There are many possible causes of [frequent urination](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15533-urination--frequent-urination). - UTI (urinary tract infection, also called cystitis, or bladder infection) - Kidney infection - when bacteria move further up into the urinary tract, the [kidneys](https://www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-disease/kidney-problems/kidney-infection.html)can become infected. Sometimes people with [nerve damage](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)in the spine cannot feel UTI symptoms (neurogenic bladder), so the infection becomes more widespread. [Bladder stones](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20354339)- when the bladder does not empty completely, urine can crystallize and form hard stones, causing pain during urination. - Interstitial cystitis (painful bladder syndrome) - a syndrome of urinary pain symptoms, the exact cause of which is unknown. Inflammation of the bladder lining may be due to trauma (from surgery or delivery/birth), overdistension, or dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles. - Prostatitis - inflammation of the prostate accompanied by irritation of the nerves in the area; not necessarily an infection, although a bacterial infection of the prostate can occur. - Urinary incontinence - leakage of urine, occurs when the urethral sphincter that controls the flow and stoppage of urine is weak. More common in women and older people. - Vaginitis - inflammation of the vagina, usually due to infection. [Candida, or yeast infection](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-candida-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), is one type of vaginitis. - Diabetes - can cause a variety of urinary problems, due to the body producing more urine to process blood sugar, and nerve damage that leads to urinary retention and incontinence. Constant thirst is also a sign of diabetic urinary symptoms. - Side effects of [cancer treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/)in pelvic area - [cancer treatments](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/urination-changes)that affect the pelvis, including radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and surgeries to remove pelvic organs, can all cause irritation or damage to the bladder. - Overactive bladder (OAB) - a group of symptoms, including frequent urination, leakage, nocturia (getting up to pee at night), and primarily, a strong urge to urinate often. Considered to be caused by inappropriate signalling of the nerves that communicate between the brain and the urinary tract organs. Causes of frequent urination vary somewhat according to biological sex. Frequent urination in men is often caused by prostate problems, while frequent urination in women may be due to pregnancy or other womens' health conditions related to the ovaries or uterus. Pressure on the bladder because of pregnancy, or from other organs, can also cause urinary frequency and discomfort. This can happen due to an anterior prolapse, when the pelvic floor is weakened, and the uterus, intestine, or bladder drop from their normal position. When a woman is pregnant, the heavy uterus often causes more frequent urination, or, in some cases, urinary retention. Damage or trauma to the pelvic floor can occur during delivery, so many women experience weak pelvic floor muscles, prolapsed uterus or bladder, and ongoing urinary urgency after they have had a baby. In men, an enlarged prostate or [prostatitis](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/p/prostatitis-(infection-of-the-prostate)) (infection and inflammation of the prostate) can put pressure on the bladder and other parts of the urinary system. A frequent need to pee can also be caused by drinking too much coffee or alcohol, or taking diuretics. Can Acupuncture Help Frequent Urination? In Chinese Medicine, urinary problems come under the classification of \"Lin Syndromes.\" Lin disorders generally involve painful, \"dribbling\" urination and are caused by disharmonies in the Bladder and Kidneys, as well as involving other major organs like the Heart, Liver, and Spleen. Dampness and Heat are the primary pathogenic factors, so we use acupuncture treatment and herbal formulations to clear heat and dampness from the body. Top 5 TCM differentiations of UTI: - Damp Heat - characterized by frequent urination, burning sensation when peeing, painful pressure in bladder, dark urine or cloudy urine that smells unusual, feelings of nausea, bitter taste in mouth - Heart Fire - frequency and urgency, thirst, hot, red face and chest, trouble sleeping/insomnia, irritability, anxiety, [heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Liver Fire - excess heat causes painful burning during urination, headaches, [ringing in ears/tinnitus,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/)constipation, feelings of anger and frustration, redness in eyes and face. - Fatigue Lin - covers urinary disorders that involve incomplete emptying of the bladder, due to prostate enlargement or prolapsed pelvic organs. - Stone Lin - obstructions of the urinary system due to buildup of minerals that create stones in the bladder, [kidney stones](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), etc. Patients who have problems with recurring UTIs may be resistant to the antibiotics they've been given. TCM herbs can be used as an additional or alternative remedy from antibiotics and help to strengthen the immune system overall. [One review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6481503/) of studies involving the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for UTIs concluded that the herbs, whether used alone or in conjunction with antibiotics, worked better than antibiotics alone. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447293/) showed that women who were prone to getting UTIs who were treated with acupuncture as preventative care only got a UTI one-third as often as women who didn't receive acupuncture. Acupuncture has also [been shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28326514/) to be highly effective for bladder pain due to interstitial cystitis. Studies have also shown that [TCM treatment](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1823-acupuncture-restores-urine-flow-blocked-by-enlarged-prostate) can relieve the blockage of urine caused by an enlarged prostate (BPH). Top 5 Tips for Preventing UTI What a relief! Now that you've gotten over that urinary tract infection, it's important to take steps to prevent getting another UTI. Here are some natural ways to prevent UTIs: - Drink more water - This may seem counterintuitive, as you don't want to have to pee even more. But you do want to be constantly flushing bacteria out of the urinary tract. Avoid drinks like coffee and soda, which can be irritating to the bladder. - Go when you feel you need to - Some therapies for overactive bladder or IC involve training yourself to hold urine, but for most people, this is not a good idea. Retaining urine for too long contributes to bacterial growth and causes overdistension of the bladder. - Hygiene - be sure to wipe from front to back when you go to the bathroom. Change clothes and underwear often, especially after sweating. During your menstrual period, change your pad and tampon frequently. - After sex - always go to the bathroom and urinate before falling asleep. - Avoid chemical products - Avoid using deodorants, douches, or scented wipes around the genital area. Consider whether contraceptive products like spermicides might also be part of the problem. Acupuncture Near Me for UTI While it is rare for a UTI to become so serious that you have a fever or become nauseated, urinary problems should be taken seriously before they become worse. If your UTIs keep coming back, or you constantly feel like you have to pee, it may be a sign that there is something deeper going on. As people age, urge incontinence, prolapsed organs due to weak pelvic floor muscles, and nerve damage can lead to more serious bladder problems. TCM provides a holistic way to treat urinary tract issues, as well as other, possibly hidden conditions in the pelvic region. Urinary urgency may be a signal of something else, so don't ignore it. Consult with your acupuncturist to find urinary frequency relief. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Herpes Simplex With Acupuncture and TCM & Xiaomei Ph.D. Cold sores around mouth, blisters on lips? Burning, itching sores around the genital area? Herpes simplex is a skin disorder caused by one of two viral infections: HSV-1 or HSV-2. TCM methods, including a painful [herpes](https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/treatment.htm) outbreak and prevent herpes simplex outbreaks in the future. Herpes simplex is one of the [most common](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-05-2020-massive-proportion-world-population-living-with-herpes-infection) kinds of infectious disease, affecting several billions of people worldwide. It is estimated that about 66% of the world's population has had a HSV-1 infection at some point in their lives. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the viral infection that is associated with [oral herpes](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/herpes-hsv1-and-hsv2/oral-herpes) or orolabial herpes-the one that causes sores around the mouth, often referred to as \"cold sores\" or \"fever blisters.\" Herpes simplex virus type is the kind that causes genital herpes. Herpes virus is related to varicella-zoster viruses, the viruses that cause Chickenpox and [Shingles](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shingles-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). How do you get herpes? The skin infection caused by herpes simplex spreads from person to person through close contact. HSV-1, or oral herpes, can spread through sharing utensils, toothbrushes, or towels, or by touching one of the mouth sores, or kissing. HSV-2, or genital herpes, is usually spread through sexual contact is therefore considered a sexually transmitted disease (STD). In fact, either one of the two viral infections can cause sores on the mouth or genital area, or even on other parts of the body. If oral herpes, or HSV-1, gets into the eyes, it can cause serious damage, even causing scarring or permanent loss of vision. A person can pass herpes to another person even if they aren't having an active outbreak with visible sores. A pregnant woman can pass the herpes virus to her baby during birth, and the virus can also be passed during breastfeeding. Once a person has been infected with HSV-2, the virus stays in the body and can lie dormant, then resurface in periodic recurrent outbreaks. Initially, herpes skin disorders manifest in the skin cells, causing the red, painful, blister-like sores. After a while, the infection moves deeper, into the nerve cells, where it can lie dormant until something happens to activate it again, like an illness or stressful life event. Medical treatment for herpes simplex focuses on minimizing the pain of an outbreak of sores and attempting to prevent future outbreaks with antiviral medications. People who have genital herpes must take care to practice safe sex and avoid sex during outbreaks in order to prevent spreading herpes to their partners. People with herpes can suffer from [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) brought on by the knowledge that they may have to live with this highly contagious viral infection for the rest of their lives, and with the danger of possibly transmitting herpes simplex to others with whom they are intimate. Fortunately, TCM herbs and acupuncture offer an alternative medicine option for dealing with herpes simplex. TCM can help with quick healing of the burning sores that signify an outbreak, but can also work on a deeper level to strengthen the immune system so that it can fight the virus better from within. Top 5 Symptoms of Herpes Simplex [Signs of a herpes](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/herpes-simplex-symptoms) simplex infection depend on which type of viral infection you have, and where the infection spreads. Usually, symptoms manifest either around the mouth or genital area, but sometimes the herpes virus can spread to the eyes (herpes keratitis). The most common symptoms of herpes include: - Itching, burning, tingling around the mouth or genital area - Painful, fluid-filled blisters or sores around the mouth or genital area - Flu-like symptoms: fever, body aches, swollen glands - Trouble urinating, [burning sensation when peeing](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Pain in eyes, cloudy vision Once a person has had their first symptomatic period of a [herpes infection](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4248-genital-herpes-hsv-2), they may have recurrence of symptoms periodically-in some cases, frequently. The majority of people who have been infected with HSV-2 experience another outbreak within a year; some people experience recurrent outbreaks several times a year or as often as once a month. There are a few other skin conditions that might sometimes be mistaken for herpes simplex. Impetigo is a bacterial infection that can cause red sores to form around the mouth and nose. \"Jock itch\" is a fungal infection that can cause a red rash in the groin area. Folliculitis is when hair follicles become inflamed and form pimples with pus; this can happen in the facial or genital region due to shaving, but it can also be related to herpes, if the viral infection causes irritation and blockages in the hair follicles. Molluscum contagiosum is another viral skin infection that causes raised lesions to form; however, they are generally painless and flesh-colored, not similar to herpes lesions. [Bacterial vaginosis](https://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/default.htm), a common bacterial infection which can cause a burning sensation in the vagina, may increase a woman's chances of getting herpes and other STDs. What Triggers a Herpes Outbreak? The herpes virus is similar to the varicella virus (chickenpox) in that it stays in the body long after the initial infection, and can flare up and cause trouble later on. The varicella virus can lie dormant for many years, and then emerge as a case of Shingles late in life, causing a very painful rash. Herpes can cause rare or frequent outbreaks, depending on the severity of the initial infection, how or if it was treated, and what sort of care a person takes to prevent recurrences. A person who has experienced recurrent outbreaks may become aware of early signs that show up a few days before sores actually break out on the skin, such as tingling or shooting pain in the genital area or around the hips or legs. The things that can trigger a herpes simplex outbreaks include: - Illness, fever - Suppression or weakness of the immune system - Exposure to sunlight, changes of the season or temperature - Menstrual period, hormonal changes - Prolonged period of stress, emotional stress - Surgery, trauma Medical Treatment for Herpes Simplex The typical treatment for herpes simplex HSV-1 and famciclovir These medications may be taken intermittently, to help treat outbreaks when they occur, or, in some cases, may be recommended for daily usage to help prevent outbreaks from occurring. For some people, these medications help to reduce the frequency of outbreaks, and there is some evidence that they may help prevent a person's sexual partner from being infected. However, these antiviral medications do not help everyone who has herpes simplex. They can only reduce the spread of the virus in the body; they do not eliminate it completely. Some people may become allergic or resistant to the drugs. Some people experience side effects, including potentially serious kidney problems or unusual bleeding. TCM treatment with herbs and acupuncture can help to reduce the severity of herpes outbreaks and prevent recurrence, without any negative side effects. Can Acupuncture Help Herpes? From the TCM point of view, the redness and burning of the blister-like rash that accompanies viral infections like herpes and varicella is caused by heat and dampness. Clearing heat and damp from the liver and gallbladder will usually be one of the primary goals of acupuncture treatment and herbal supplementation, as this will help to quickly cool down an outbreak of the painful sores. Maintaining the health and balance of the liver system long-term will help to prevent future outbreaks. TCM also factors in emotional well-being when considering each individual's presentation of a disease. The flare up of herpes simplex viral infection is associated with stress and negative emotions, especially anger. Anger is connected to the Liver and Gallbladder, and also to the eyes, which is why sometimes the herpes skin disorder will manifest in the eyes. Learning lifestyle behaviors and dietary choices that will help to balance the emotions and reduce excess heat in the body will also help reduce the occurrence of herpes flare ups. Some herbal formulations work well to heal sores related to herpes outbreak. There are also specific Chinese herbs that function as \"antivirals.\" These [herbs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9950099/) can help control the virus in the body, which, when combined with treatment and herbs that strengthen the immune system, can be effective at reducing the risk of recurrent outbreaks of herpes. Acupuncture Near Me for Herpes Simplex While herpes simplex is often considered a disease one has to \"learn to live with,\" it is not necessary to suffer the pain and emotional burden of herpes simplex infection without relief. Alternative medicine for herpes in the form of acupuncture and herbs offers a holistic treatment option that can help relieve the physical symptoms of recurrent herpes outbreaks as well as associated mental and emotional struggles with shame, [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), depression, and relationship concerns. Boosting the immune system, strengthening the Qi and organ systems, reducing heat through proper nutrition, and relieving stress can all work to help people with herpes live free of the fear of the next outbreak. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Lyme Disease With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lyme-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Qineng Tan, Ph.D. Red, circular rash that looks like a \"bulls-eye?\" Joint pain, muscle aches, and fatigue? These are signs that a person may have [Lyme disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651), an infectious disease that humans can contract when they are bitten by an infected tick. Lyme, a bacterial infection, can take a while to develop, and can cause chronic symptoms if it is not treated effectively. Acupuncture and TCM offer an alternative or adjunct way to help resolve the painful, debilitating symptoms of long-term Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a type of bacterial infection transmitted by ticks. Ticks are parasitic arachnids, small spider-like creatures who bite other animals and feed on blood. If a tick is infected with a disease, it can infect the person or other animal it bites. Lyme disease, which is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium, is just one of several infectious diseases that ticks can spread, including [Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF)](https://www.sepsis.org/sepsisand/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/). These critters are sometimes called \"deer ticks\" or \"bear ticks\" because they generally thrive in forest environments where they live symbiotically with these kinds of animals. But being bit by deer tick (tick on deer) doesn't only happen in deeply wooded areas; anywhere that deer, squirrels, lizards, or birds may come into suburban areas, it is possible to be bitten by a tick. Actually, ticks, and therefore the infectious diseases they carry, are growing more prevalent because of humans encroaching into animals' habitats. Tick bites most commonly occur in spring and summer. Ticks do not fly; they can only get onto dogs or humans by crawling on them. This can happen quite easily if a tick is on a bush or other plant, and a person or dog brushes up against it. Ticks attach themselves to a host, and slowly suck their blood. [Lyme disease in dogs](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/lyme-disease-in-dogs/) cannot be transmitted to humans, nor is lyme disease contagious, passing from human to human; you can only get Lyme disease by being bitten yourself. [In order to pass Lyme disease to a person,](https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/lyme-disease/lyme-disease/10-facts-about-lyme/) a tick generally has to have been attached to that person's skin for 36 hours or more. Ticks can be as small as the head of a pin, and they burrow in moist, hairy areas of their host's body, so it is actually quite easy to have a tick on you without knowing it. After the tick drops off, a person may not feel anything at all, or only have a small, red bump that resembles a mild insect bite. In some cases, though, a person may feel right away that the area of the bite is hot, swollen, or causing a burning sensation. If the tick was carrying Lyme disease, it can take several days to a few weeks for the more serious symptoms of Lyme to develop. Even then, the symptoms are not necessarily distinctive. The early [symptoms of Lyme disease](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/index.html) can feel like a flu; fever, fatigue, aches and pains. Not everyone infected with Lyme will have the characteristic tick bullseye rash that develops around the site of the tick bite. When treated promptly with antibiotics, most cases of Lyme disease will resolve within a few weeks. However, many cases of Lyme disease are not diagnosed right away, and if it goes undetected, chronic problems can develop in the ensuing months. Once the bacteria has spread throughout the body, even a long course of antibiotics may not be able to get rid of it. Long-term Lyme symptoms may appear similar to other chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, or neurological conditions, such as [fibromyalgia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-musculoskeletal-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [Bell's palsy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bells-palsy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [MS](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-ms-how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [chronic fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) syndrome, cases Lyme disease causes [shoulder pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shoulder-pain-by-acupuncture-and-tcm/), hip pain, knee pain, fatigue, and other symptoms so severe that people can't go about their regular daily routine. Sometimes diagnosis and treatment is further complicated by coinfections: concurrent other infections, that can also have been transmitted via the tick bite, or occur independently of it. Lyme and other tick-borne illnesses like RMSF can also trigger sepsis infections, which can be life-threatening, or lead to chronic pain, and/or PTSD (post-traumatic [stress disorder](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)). An [MRSA skin infection](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mrsa/symptoms-causes/syc-20375336) (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), a type of staph infection that enters the skin through a wound, can develop around the infected tick bite; this staph skin infection is particularly resistant to antibiotics. Unfortunately, symptoms of Lyme can become progressively worse over time, leading to disability and even death. Acupuncture and TCM offer an alternative for helping to heal Lyme disease, whether it is still in the early stages, or when it has become a [chronic infectious disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23400696/). Top 10 Symptoms of Lyme Disease Signs of Lyme disease develop slowly, in stages, and can vary widely from person to person. Without the presence of the tell-tale bulls' eye rash, both patients and doctors may have difficulty linking the spectrum of symptoms to a Lyme infection. - Joint pain, swollen joins, [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Neuropathy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), numbness or tingling, Bell's palsy (face drooping) - Fatigue - Bulls-eye rash, also known as [Sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [sleep - Brain fog - Trouble breathing - Vertigo, dizziness - Blurred vision Other possible symptoms of Lyme include: [ringing in the ears (tinnitus)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), [heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [problems with memory](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [concentration](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), vision problems or inflammation around the eyes, and liver problems, like hepatitis. [Symptoms of lyme disease in dogs](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-dogs/lyme-disease-lyme-borreliosis-in-dogs) are similar to those in humans, including stiff, swollen joints, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Long-term effects of Lyme disease are sometimes referred to as \" [post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.](https://www.aldf.com)\" Doctors are not sure why some people, even after being treated with antibiotics, seem to still be affected by long-term effects of Lyme disease. Medical Diagnosis and Treatment of Lyme Disease Getting a clear diagnosis of Lyme disease can be difficult. Currently, there is a [two-step diagnostic process](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/diagnosistesting/index.html) recommended to determine if a person has contracted Lyme disease. Two main [kinds of tests](https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-disease-test/) can detect antibodies the body's immune system creates to fight off the infection. However, it takes a while-at least several weeks, usually-for the body to build up enough of the antibodies that they become detectable. Often when people are aware early on that they may have been infected, and they get a test, it turns out to be negative. Usually, doctors try first one type of antibody test, and then the other to see if they get a positive result. Even then, medical science acknowledges that many (perhaps half of) Lyme disease cases are not detected this way. A newer, still somewhat unproven form of testing involves taking a blood culture and trying to grow the bacteria that cause Lyme in a laboratory setting. This testing is more advanced and may be difficult for patients to access. Once physicians have determined that Lyme infection is present, the usual [ treatment](https://www.columbia-lyme.org/treatment-options) is a course of antibiotics that lasts a few to several weeks. In many cases, this seems to clear up the infection. In others, though, the antibiotics do not resolve the myriad symptoms patients are experiencing. Using antibiotics on a long-term basis is often not effective, and carries other risks to a person's health. Ongoing joint pain and inflammation is then usually treated with steroid medications or NSAIDS. Sleep problems and fatigue are often treated with antidepressants. These medications may help relieve symptoms temporarily, but they come with side effects, and do not address the root causes of the chronic symptoms of Lyme disease. 3 Stages of Lyme Disease When early detection occurs, the Western medical approach of using antibiotics can often resolve Lyme disease within a few to several weeks. However, if the infectious disease is not found soon enough, Lyme disease will progress to more advanced stages. TCM methods can be helpful during all three stages of Lyme. - First Stage Lyme disease - Within the first few weeks of the infection, and with early detection, antibiotics can be very helpful, working pretty well to stop the spread of the bacteria. However, because Lyme disease is often misdiagnosed, many people do not receive this treatment soon enough. During this phase, the symptoms are similar to those of the flu: chills, fatigue, heaviness in the limbs. As the infection moves in deeper, it can cause the skin rash, or hives. TCM treatment during the first stage will focus on clearing heat and detoxifying the body to rid it of infection. - Second Stage Lyme disease - If the bacteria causing Lyme disease is not halted in its spread, it begins to affect the organs and the blood. The central nervous system and heart can become infected. These infections can last for months, and if not taken care of, can develop into the third phase. This is when a person may begin to feel joint aches, and arthritis-like symptoms. The body's Qi and blood become deficient. Treatment with acupuncture and herbs at this point will work to help boost the Qi, clear heat and strengthen the whole immune system, and clear inflammation. - Advanced stage Lyme disease - As the infection drags on, it can cause joint, skin, and nerve damage can take hold. Ongoing Qi and blood deficiency and stagnation cause fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, and memory loss. A TCM provider will recognize what stage of Lyme disease a patient is in according to their symptoms, and customize the acupuncture points and herbal formulae used depending on their needs. Acupuncture for Infectious Diseases For millennia, TCM has recognized a type of disease that is caused by infection and can affect all systems of the body. We call this type of illness [Gu zheng](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2019/07/26/lyme-treatment-success-with-chinese-medicine), or \"Gu syndrome.\" This classification covers illnesses caused by \"invisible\" pathogens, like viruses, funguses, and parasites. Along with the toxins from the tick bite, we consider how pathogens like heat, wind, and dampness all play a role in the illness. According to TCM theory, extreme heat in the body is also considered \"toxic.\" This category of condition helps us understand a variety of different systemic inflammatory illnesses, and gives us a framework for addressing each individual's presenting symptoms. One of the key features of Gu syndrome illnesses is how terrible and hopeless they can make people feel. Not only do people suffering from chronic inflammatory or immune-related conditions feel constantly tired and ache-y, but some of the sensations seem to come and go and feel so mysterious that they can't be explained satisfactorily. If this is then compounded with the fact that many doctors don't understand or know how to deal with the illness, it can leave patients feeling very frustrated and helpless. After months or years of this, debilitating physical symptoms may be accompanied by feelings of [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). A Yale Medical University [study of patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012507/), all in their 40s, suffering from long-term Lyme complications found that they had to reduce their activities, or even give up working, and doubted that they would ever recover. In interviews, patients made it clear that working with doctors who were more holistic was far preferred, and thus many had turned to CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) providers for help with Lyme disease. Making a full recovery from long-term Lyme disease is possible, but it can take a long time to get rid of a bacterial infection that has woven itself deeply into the body's organ systems. The benefit of Chinese herbal medicine for Lyme is that the powerful substances in the herbs can penetrate deep into the body at a cellular level. Working with an experienced acupuncturist means that your [Chinese herbs for Lyme disease](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/digital/index.php?i=739&a_id=33707&pn=44&r=t&Page=44) can be regularly updated, according to your individual needs, as you progress. This, in combination with acupuncture treatment for Lyme disease, moxibustion, and nutrition guidelines for an anti-inflammatory diet can all help patients feel better faster and prevent any further damage to the organs and the nervous system. Our [TCM detox program](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-detox-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) may also be helpful. Top 5 Tips for Lyme Disease Self-Care Sometimes re-prioritizing health over all else is necessary in order to heal from a serious infectious disease. - Conserve energy. Rest as much as possible. - Drink extra water. - Eliminate coffee, alcohol, spicy foods, chips, roasted nuts, any food that adds heat and inflames further. Try to reduce heat. - Eat more cooling foods. Mung bean tea is an ideal choice. - In the later stages of the disease, we may need to add more strengthening foods, like chicken stock and soup, and will recommend different herbal formulae, as well. Overall, reducing stress and finding a meditation practice is helpful. For more detailed instructions on how to eat right to reduce inflammation, [ see our article](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) specifically addressing anti-inflammatory food and lifestyle choices. Acupuncture Near Me for Lyme Disease Dealing with a complicated illness like Lyme disease is challenging for people and doctors. A long process of discovery and commitment may be necessary. Working with an experienced TCM provider gives patients the benefits of a multi-pronged, holistic way of addressing multiple symptoms, both physical and emotional. Acupuncture for infectious diseases like Lyme takes into account each patient's individual concerns, and addresses the complex symptoms of Lyme in concert. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.
