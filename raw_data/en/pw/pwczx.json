I am thrilled to have a new oral therapy (that isn't a pill!) to provide my patients who are in need of blood sugar regulation.[...] I love that the primary ingredient is Sencha. Sencha is a Japanese green tea that is quite similar to matcha green tea and is a profound antioxidant. Ginger and Fennel are delightful carminatives- a type of herb that aids digestion and sooths gastric juices. Overall, I'm not only impressed, but also hooked on the Wellness Collection. The flavor is so appealing. It's great to have something that I can turn to as a satisfying treat to balance hunger and blood sugar swings between meals.\" Kathy Chrzaszcz Registered Holistic Nutritionist \"As a Nutritionist, there are a few key factors that I focus on when looking at a client's overall well-being. Blood sugar balance, stress levels, and digestion are some of those major components. Herbaly's Wellness Collection tea has incredible herbs and ingredients such as sencha, dandelion, tulsi, ginger, fennel, turmeric and lavender, which makes this tea a powerhouse of wellbeing! Many of these ingredients truly are some of my favorite herbs.\" Dr. Alicia McCubbins Registered Holistic Nutritionist \"Great tea! Wellness Collection by Herbaly is undoubtedly one of the best blends around; right from the moment you open the package you can feel the nicest aroma and you're sure it's going to be one of the best tea experiences. From the first sip, you can feel its delicate taste, no bitterness at all or harsh flavors. It tastes smooth and fresh, and thanks to all its powerful ingredients, gives you a sense of relaxing and calmness. Best of all, it's low in caffeine, no sugar added (and no need to add artificial sweetener) and also vegan and GMO-Free!\" Janeth Santiago Rios Master in Nutrition and Metabolism \"Herbaly's Wellness Collection is a delicious, innovative, and comprehensive formula.
