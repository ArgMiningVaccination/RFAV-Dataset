The sca le, scope, and terms of BRI projects remain shrouded in relative opacity, with China as of this writing only incrementally disclosing debt sustainability policies and lending terms, largely after there was significant international public clamor for more t ransparency.4 The 2017 formal handover of Hambantota5 port in Sri Lanka to China (under a 99 -year lease as part of debt repayment due to Sri Lanka's default) raises caution for populations of other BRI debtor states concerned, such as: (1) ensuring accountable democratic sovereignty in bilateral lending agre ements with China;6 (2) building in transparency as BRI debtor states act in partnership with China to design short -term and long -term development strategies;7 and (3) determining Chinese firms operating the BRI projects can be held to observe guaranteed human rights standards in the performance of business activities under the aegis 2 Jonathan E.

[and] [t]ake further measures on business and human rights in line with its international obligations and ensure that companies operating in high -risk or conflict areas conduct human rights due diligence in line with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\"19 The Conclusion (Development IS Human Rights and Human Rights IS Development: Paths Forward for the BRI) I will address certain \"human rights imperialism\"20 critiques against the \"rights -based approach to development,\"21 distinguishing the same from the crystallizing \"right to development.\"22 Human rights -based approaches to development are focused on the centrality of human rights to \"legislation, administrative practice, and policy delivery,\"23 but the crystallizing rig ht to development (both as customary norm and in the pending draft Convention on the Right to Development24) goes much further by calling for the internalization of human rights in the processes, outcomes, and assessments of development. While the prolifer ation of external capital sources is crucial to achieving raw economic growth, no single sovereign \u2014including China \u2014can reject the full application of international labor, environmental, social, and all other human rights obligations in sovereign project fi nancing activities and the long -term implementation of infrastructure connectivity to achieve genuine integral human development.

INTRODUCTION : A PROTEAN PARADIGM OF \"DEVELOPMENT \" THROUGH CHINA 'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI) The global need for infrastructure \u2014estimated25 thus far at around US$94 Trillion by 2040 with a further US$3.5 Trillion required to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for electricity and water \u2014is spurring the race for cross -border connectivity projects around the world.26 Said proje cts include the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Master Plan on Connectivity 2025,27 plans for fiber optic, digital and physical infrastructure connectivity in Africa,28 South Asia plans for infrastructure connectivity,29 the World Bank's sup port for the Global Infrastructure Connectivity Alliance (GICA),30 as well as recent European Union initiatives to build climate change adaptation for major infrastructure projects.31 Arguably, of the many cross -border infrastructure connectivity project s proliferating throughout the globe in this decade, none might be as staggering in scope, scale, and breadth as the People's Republic of China's announcement of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) announced in 2013.32 As of this writing, the full contours of financing, projects, partnerships, and contract terms under the BRI are elusive for researchers, lending the impression that this fluidity is both a key strength and at the same time a point of critique. While there is considerable official documentatio n detailing China's grand dramatic geopolitical vision for the BRI,33 it is significant to note that, as of this writing, the BRI does not have an identifiable 25 See Forecasting Infrastructure Investment Needs and Gaps , GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE OUTLOOK , https://outlook.gihub.org/ (last visited J anuary 15, 2020). 26 See Competing Visions , CTR.

What is readily known about the BRI since the announcement of its creation in 2013, is its massive scop e of allegedly available (but not necessarily already earmarked, allocated, or actually distributed or transferred to BRI debtor countries42) funding, estimated at between USD$1 Trillion to USD$1.2 Trillion43 and USD$8 Trillion44, and which is to be drawn predominantly from a single sovereign source, the People's Republic of China.

In his 2017 keynote add ress at the May 2017 Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing, China's President Xi Jinping described the BRI as exemplifying China's grand vision for global development, with political, economic, cultural, scientific, and multilat eral dimensions built under a China's state -driven development architecture: First, we should build the Belt and Road into a road for peace . The ancient silk routes thrived in times of peace, but lost vigor in times of war. The pursuit of the Belt and Road Initiative requires a peaceful and stable environment. We should foster a new type of international relations featuring win -win cooperation; and we should forge partnerships of dialogue with no confrontation and of friendship rather than alliance. All countries should respect each other's sovereignty, dignity and territorial integrity, each other's development paths and social systems, and e ach other's core interests and major concerns...Some regions along the ancient Silk Road used to be a land of milk and honey. Yet today, these places are often associated with conflict, turbulence, crisis and challenge. Such state of affairs should not be al lowed to continue . We should foster the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and create a security environment built and shared by all. We should work to resolve hotspot issues through political means, and promote mediatio n in the spirit of justice. We should intensify counter -terrorism efforts, address both its symptoms and root causes, and strive to eradicate poverty, backwardness and social injustice. Second, we should build the Belt and Road into a road of prosperity. Development holds the master key to solving all problems. In pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative, we should focus on the fundamental issue of development, release the growth potential of various countries and achieve economic integration and interconnecte d development and deliver benefits to all ...We should establish a stable and sustainable financial safeguard system that keeps risks under control, create new models of investment and financing, encourage greater cooperation between government and private ca pital and build a diversified financing system and a multi -tiered capital market. We should also develop inclusive finance and improve financial services networks ...Infrastructure connectivity is the foundation of development through cooperation. We should p romote land, maritime, air and cyberspace connectivity, concentrate our efforts on key passageways, cities and projects and 45 See DELOITTE INSIGHTS , CHINA 'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE : RECALIBRATION AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES 2 (2019) ; Evelyn Cheng, Amid Criticism , China's Xi Says Belt and Road Projects can be ' Shared by the World ', CNBC (Apr. 27, 2019, 7:47 AM), https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/27/belt -and-road-initiative - chinas -xi-concludes -bri-forum -in-beijing.html. 2020 THE COMPLEXITIES OF DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE 308 connect networks of highways, railways and sea ports...Third, we should build the Belt and Road into a road of opening up.... The Belt an d Road Initiative should be an open one that will achieve both economic growth and balanced development. [...] We should build an open platform of cooperation and uphold and grow an open world economy. We should jointly create an environment that will facili tate opening up and development, establish a fair, equitable and transparent system of international trade and investment rules and boost the orderly flow of production factors, efficient resources allocation and full market integration. We welcome efforts made by other countries to grow open economies based on their national conditions, participate in global governance and provide public goods. Together, we can build a broad community of shared interests. [...]46 Despite the above language emphasizing equali ty of cooperation and joint partnerships not just in BRI projects but for shaping the international economic system as a whole, scholarship in Chinese academic journals themselves superlatively depict the BRI as \"a China -specific approach for global govern ance;\"47 \"China's grand diplomacy;\"48 \"shaping a shared 21st Century;\"49 \"China's Exploration in the Construction of International Institutions;\"50 China creating a \"Regional Community of Common Destiny;\"51 \"China's Marshall Plan;\"52 with China's vast \"pot ential to redefine international trade governance and the laws that establish its order.\"53 There is no official map of the BRI projects.

The Silk Road Economic Belt focuses on bringing together China, Central Asia, Russia and Europe (the Baltic) ; linking China with the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea through Central Asia and West Asia; and connecting China with Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Indian Ocean. The 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is designed to go from China's coast to Eur ope through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean in one route, and from China's coast through the South China Sea to the South Pacific in the other. On land, the Initiative will focus on jointly building a new Eurasian Land Bridge and developing China -Mongolia -Russia, China Central Asia -West Asia and China -Indochina Peninsula economic corridors by taking advantage of international transport routes, relying on core cities along the Belt and Road and using key economic industrial parks as cooperation pla tforms. 54 Belt and Road Initiative, WORLD BANK (Mar. 29, 2018), https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/regional - integration/brief/belt -and-road-initiative. 2020 THE COMPLEXITIES OF DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE 310 At sea, the Initiative will focus on jointly building smooth, secure, and efficient transport routes connecting major [seaports] along the Belt and Road. The China -Pakistan Economic Corridor and the Bangladesh -China - India -Myanmar Economic Corrido r are closely related to the BRI. [...]\"55 All told, the BRI comprises six land corridors, one maritime corridor, and more recently including \"an Artic 'Ice Silk Road'...extend[ing] to more than 71 countries, together [comprising] up to 65% of the world's po pulation and mak[ing] up 40% of global GDP as of 2017.\"56 The unprecedented scale of these projects run parallel with China's global drive for resources, that according to an environmental scholar, creates a \"dizzying variety of resource extraction, energy , agricultural, and infrastructure projects \u2014 roads, railroads, hydropower dams, mines \u2014 that are wreaking unprecedented damage to ecosystems and biodiversity.\"57 The China -centric approach in the vision for the BRI stands in sharp contrast with the United States' Marshall Plan (the postwar European Recovery Program),58 which did not create any American economic corridors in Europe, in the way that China envisions its economic corridors globally for the BRI. Nobel Peace Prize winner General George C. Marshall made it clear that the Marshall Plan was a foreign aid program, largely to be determined by European states based on their own agreement: [...] It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of norma l economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a wo rking economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist. Such assistance, I am convinced, must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop. Any assistance that this Governme nt may render in the future should provide a cure rather than a mere palliative. Any government that is willing to assist in the task of recovery will find full co -operation I am sure, on the part of the United States Government. Any government which maneu vers to block the recovery of other countries cannot expect help from us. Furthermore, governments, political parties, or groups which seek to 55 Press Release, Nat'l Dev. and Reform Comm'n & Ministry of Com. of the People's Republic of China, Visions and Actions on Jointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st -Century Maritime Silk Road (Mar. 28, 2015). 56 Michael Amouyal, The Belt & Road Initiative: Scope of Projects and Financing Issues , EURO 3, 2019), William Legacy of China's Drive for Global Resources\", Yale Environment 360, Christenson & Eric Christenson, The Marshall Plan: \"A Short Time to Change the World ,\" in POLITICS AND CULTURES OF LIBERATION : MEDIA , MEMORY , AND PROJECTIONS OF DEMOCRACY 344 (Hans Bak et al. eds., 2018); David J.

It is already evident that, before the United States Government can proceed much further in its efforts to alleviate the situation and help start the European world on its way to recovery, there must be some agreement among the countries o f Europe as to the requirements of the situation and the part those countries themselves will take in order to give proper effect to whatever action might be undertaken by this Government . It would be neither fitting nor efficacious for this Government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a program designed to place Europe on its feet economically. This is the business of the Europeans. The initiative, I think, must come from Europe. The role of this country should consist of friendly aid in the drafting of a European program and of later support of such a program so far as it may be practical for us to do so . The program should be a joint one, agreed to by a number, if not all European nations.59 Comparing the vision for the BRI with that of the Marshall P lan, it is clear that the BRI will not constitute foreign aid but rather creates a global program for financing China's massive investments into infrastructure, energy, mining, telecommunications, and IT projects with strategic partners along the \"Belt and Road.\" The March 2018 Amendment60 to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China enshrined the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,61 whose 14 -point fundamental principles include \"a new vision for development .\" The 14 -point fundamental principles are as follows: 1. Ensuring Party leadership over all work; 2. Committing to a people -centered approach; 3. Continuing to comprehensively deepen reform; 4. Adopting a new vision for development; 5. Seeing that the people run the cou ntry; 6. Ensuring every dimension of governance is law -based; 7. Upholding core socialist values; 8. Ensuring and improving living standards through development; 9. Ensuring harmony between humans and nature; 10. Pursuing a holistic approach to national security; 11.

Upholding the principles of 'one country, two systems' and promoting national reunification; 13. Promoting the building of a community with a shared future for humanity; 14. Exercising full an d rigorous governance over the Party.62 Noting China's vision for development, the March 2018 Amendment to China's Constitution specifically amended the seventh paragraph of the Preamble to the Constitution to read as follows: The victory in China's New -Democratic Revolution and the successes in its socialist cause have been achieved by the Chinese people of all nationalities, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism -Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, by upholding trut h, correcting errors and surmounting numerous difficulties and hardships. China will be in the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come. The basic task of the nation is to concentrate its effort on socialist modernization along the road of Chines e-style socialism. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism -Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development, and the Xi Jinping Tho ught on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the Chinese people of all nationalities will continue to adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist road, persevere in reform and opening to the outside world, steadily imp rove socialist institutions, develop the socialist market economy, develop socialist democracy, improve the socialist rule of law, implement the new development concept , and work hard and self -reliantly to modernize the country's industry, agriculture, national defense and science and technology step by step and promote the coordinated development of the material, political, spiritual, social, and ecological civilizations, to turn China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperou s, powerful, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful and achieve the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.63 (Italics added.)

Safeguarding the right to development is the precondition for realizi ng economic, cultural, social, and environmental rights, and obtaining civil and political rights.\"70 The subtle but significant difference between these two conceptions lies with China's sequenced (and fairly statist) approach to achieving desired material well -being before realizing all other human rights, whereas the 1986 Declaration on the Rights refer s to the full corpus of simultaneous participation, contribution, and enjoyment rights with respect to economic, social, cultural, and political development in a manner that fully realizes all human rights and fundamental freedoms.71 In this sense, China's articulated philosophy on the right to development dovetails with another scholar's observations that: [i]n official Southern discourses, the right to development has mainly been advanced to rationalize and justify national priorities as well as legitimiz e statist political and economic agendas using the language of rights...it is articulated not so much against the developed West, but as a means of maintaining the status quo and to counter domestic and international 65 Id. 66 The Right to Development: China's Philosophy, Practice, and Contribution , STATE COUNCIL INFO.

While the earlier phase of the discourses on the right to development tended to reflect a polemic of resistance, more recent debates increasingly reflect an international politics of power. The paradox of the right to development talk coming from the South is that it is at once deployed to demand radical change in the international economic order and to resist change in the national political order. When Chinese officials invoke the right to development to demand more favorable trade terms or when the Ugan dan government invokes it to push for more development assistance from the West, the emphasis is often on challenging a hegemonic international economic system with a view to challenging the status quo. Yet, when China invokes the right to development to deflect criticism of its human rights record, or to resist pressure to cap environmental emissions, the intent is clearly to maintain the domestic economic order and preserve the political status quo.72 It is against the backdrop of these conceptual, philo sophical, and normative differences on the right to development that this paper examines China's vision, actions, and commitments in its BRI. Clearly, the BRI is \"not a selfless venture\",73 and it is \"not China's Marshall Plan\".74 Rightly or wrongly, vario us militaristic, geopolitical, strategic, hegemonic, motives have been ascribed to the BRI,75 particularly as the BRI will more predominantly involve China's state -owned enterprises (SOEs) - rather than the Chinese private sector - clearly making the BRI a vehicle for \"China's economic statecraft.\"76 It is not the purpose of this paper to engage those particular issues, but rather to take it as a given fact that the BRI is the globalized epitome of Chinese development financing. Globalizing China's paradigm for sovereign development financing through the BRI77 introduces various complexities to questions of democracy, development, and human rights. 72 Bonny Ibhawoh, The Right to Development: The Politics and Polemics of Power and Resistance, 33 HUM.

The [Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or AIIB] and the [New Development Bank or NDB] do have callable capital, but borrow in both Chinese and global capital markets. Western -led [multilateral development banks or MDBs] have callable and paid -in capital like the AIIB and NDB, but issue bonds in global as well as local currency markets. In terms of lending practices, China's national DFIs operating abroad tend to lend in extraordinarily large lines of credit and loans for bundles of infrastructure and energy and other overseas national development projects, and do so in a coordinated fashion - with a number of different (Chinese) bank and non -bank corporate actors taking part in creating what we term in this article 'coordi nated credit spaces'. The NDB, on a smaller scale, uniquely thus far, on -lends to national development banks in member countries such that the national development banks, in turn, provide financing for a number of loans. The AIIB is more like the Western MDBs, following an individual project finance approach.... Chinese national DFIs lend in both US dollars and in Chinese currency...[a]ll of these DFIs expect to be repaid in the currency that they lend in, with the exception of China's policy banks, which hav e often required that a certain amount of loans be paid back with commodity sales. In terms of the composition of lending, all of the DFIs in which China is a key shareholder tend to focus on energy and infrastructure, which is distinct from what the Weste rn DFIs have done until recently... With respect to governance, China's national DFIs have a single shareholder governance structure...Unlike the Western -led MDBs, none of the Chinese DFIs attach explicit or overt policy conditionalities to their 78 Gregory T.

The main types of China's financing into the BRI projects have been identified as: (1) syndicated bank loans by the China Development Bank, China Eximbank, and the four biggest state -owned comme rcial banks; (2) sectoral loans exclusively provided by the China Development Bank and China Eximbank; (3) equity investments by the state -owned Silk Road Fund; and (4) cross -border investments by Chinese (primarily state -owned) enterprises.84 However thes e sources are also changing, inasmuch as the tenor and focus of BRI projects themselves appear to frequently change according to China's pronouncements.85 In response to criticisms of the fluidity of this financing framework and concerns raised over the BR I as a 'debt trap' for lower income countries,86 China's Ministry 79 Id. at 247 -49. 80 Stephen B.

The document tacitly conveys that the onus falls more on BRI debtor countries to do a sufficient debt sustainability analysis for them as sov ereign borrowers, rather than reining in China's financing for BRI projects that might not meet any of these standards within a satisfactory bandwidth or range consistent with international standards and best practices consistent with both lawful, as well as legitimate, methods for debt sustainability, public debt transparency, or sovereign debt restructuring.91 The seeming ambiguity of China's views about its role and responsibility as a sovereign lender to BRI borrower countries stands in sharp contrast w ith China's stated commitments during its Third Universal Periodic Review before the Human Rights Council, where China's Vice -Foreign Minister hailed China's \"human rights achievements, human rights development path, and the country's determination to prom ote the human rights situation...China has decided to accept 284 out of 346 recommendations put forward by various parties.\"92 It is reported that among these recommendations, in particular, are commitments to respect human rights in its foreign investment a ctivities, especially to \"promote measures that ensure that development and infrastructure projects inside and 98bf1d35a056; JOHN HURLEY ET AL ., CTR.

Neither is China unused to transparency norms affecting its foreign investments. China has shown that it can conclude a foreign investment treaty imposing mutual transparenc y obligations of host States and home States of foreign investment with respect to all laws, regulations, and policies relating to foreign investment. 96 As observed by another scholar, China has in fact already begun including some provisions recognizing sustainable development, environment, transparency, labour and human rights in China's international investment agreements.97 As a treaty party to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, China has also assumed the responsibility that \"[p]arties shall accoun t for their nationally determined contributions.

Furthermore, as summarized from an academic article by the UN Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, China's own domestic regu lations appear to already require such transparency and compliance with environmental and social safeguards as part of China's external lending and outbound investment activities: Over the past decade, an increasing number of guidelines relating to busine ss and finance have been adopted by different government bodies. Some relate to human rights, such as the principles of non -discrimination, compensation of losses in case of resettlement and consultation with affected communities. The Chinese authorities have made efforts to strengthen their regulations for outbound investment in order to avoid negative environmental and social impact. Achieving greater human rights protection would also require ensuring that existing guidelines and policies are more rigorously monitored in their implementation. Most are currently voluntary and lack an accountability and enforcement mechanism. In particular, affected individuals and communities should have access to effective remedies if existing reg ulations and international norms are not adhered to. The State's most recent national human rights plan of action (2012 -2015) did not address the issue of human rights in the field of business, by for example ensuring that lending and outbound investment complied with international human rights standards. In December 2007, the State -owned Assets Supervision and Administration Council issued a set of guidelines for all central State -owned enterprises on fulfilling corporate social responsibilities. The gui delines require State -owned enterprises to give top priority to work and product safety, the legal interests of employees, compliance with regulations and laws, investment into environmental protection, and non -discrimination on grounds of gender, national ity, religion or age, including equal pay for equal work, and encourage State - owned enterprises to participate in social welfare programmes. In March 2009, the Ministry of Commerce issued Measures for Overseas Investment Management, containing detailed reg ulations for the approval of overseas investments. According to the regulations, any overseas investment considered likely to violate \"any international treaty conducted by China 98 Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change art. 5, Dec. 12, 2015, T.I.A.S. No. 16 -1104. 2020 THE COMPLEXITIES OF DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE 320 with a foreign party\" would not be approved. While in theory this allows for the consideration of obligations from international human rights treaties signed by China and partner countries, the author was not informed during his visit on how the Ministry screens overseas investments that may pose significant human rights risks. Th e Guidelines on Environmental Protection in Foreign Investment and Cooperation, published by the Ministry of Commerce in March 2013, focus on ensuring environmental protection and promote the sustainable development of foreign investment and cooperation. T hey also require, however, that enterprises should respect the religious belief, cultural traditions and national customs of community residents of the host country, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of labourers, offer training, employment and re-employment opportunities to residents in the surrounding areas, promote the harmonious development of the local economy, the environment and the community, and cooperate on the basis of mutual benefit. China Banking Regulatory Commission's Green Credi t Guidelines apply to all policy and commercial banks. Article 4 of the Guidelines covers \"hazards and risks [to] the environment and society that may be brought about by the construction, production and operating activities of banking institutions' client s and key affiliated parties thereof, including environmental and social issues related to energy consumption, pollution, land, health, safety, resettlement of people, ecological protection [and] climate change\". Article 10 stipulates that Chinese banking institutions are to \"establish and constantly improve policies, systems and processes for environmental and social risk management\", while article 11 requires clients facing major environmental and social risks to put in place risk response plans and to es tablish sufficient, effective stakeholder communication mechanisms, including third -party assessment of such risks. In 2012, an article 21 was included in the Green Credit Guidelines, requiring banking institutions to strengthen explicitly environmental a nd social risk management for overseas projects for which credit has been granted. It requires Chinese financial institutions to ensure that project sponsors comply with applicable laws and regulations on, inter alia, environmental protection, land, health and safety in the country or jurisdiction hosting the project. In addition, banking institutions are required to pledge publicly that appropriate international practices or international norms will be followed in the implementation of the project so as to ensure alignment with good international practices. The Green Credit Guidelines provide an opportunity to enhance respect for human rights in Chinese project financing and foreign investment. Yet, doubts remain around the implementation of the Guidelines by Chinese 321 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 banking institutions in overseas projects given that the mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing compliance still appear to be weak. While the Guidelines attribute the responsibility to supervise environmental and social risk management, includi ng off -site and on -site examination, to the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the author did not receive any information on any investigations conducted with regard to cases of potential non -compliance of financial institutions when lending for overseas projects. Since 2016 a new set of regulation has been developed by China to be further applicable to international lending and outbound investment. These new norms try to improve the system of risk assessment (including environmental and social risks) an d places this assessment as a key aspect to make the final decision on the pertinent project. They also emphasize on the comprehensiveness of that assessment which has to be both ex ant and ex post . They also reinforce the obligation of Chinese corporations to understand and respect the laws of the countries where they operate. Yet, these initiatives are not legally binding and it remains to be seen how they are operationalized. The new (2017) Environmental Risk Management Initiative for China's Overseas Investment encourages investors to consider environmental, social and governance factors when making and managing investments. This includes disclosing information and then working with environmental groups so that disclosure of information impro ves project management. It also calls on investors to fully understand Chinese, local and international environmental standards and wherever possible to apply the toughest of those; and to carry out full environmental due diligence. The recently (January 2018) passed Guiding Opinions of the Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce on Strengthening the Construction of the Credit System in the Field of Foreign Economic Cooperation establish that Chinese persons and entities participatin g in international economic cooperation should respect relevant laws and regulations of domestic and cooperating countries and regions, and United Nations resolutions, among other aspects...\"99 It begs explanation, therefore, that as of this writing China ha s not yet opened the BRI to the fullest transparency and information access to all communities likely to be affected by the environmental, climate change, labor, and human rights impacts of BRI projects. Other regions \u2014such as Europe through its Aarhus Con vention,100 Latin America and the Caribbean through its own Escaz\u00fa Agreement101\u2014have long recognized the importance of such transparency and information access for infrastructure and other forms of development 99 Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, A Human Rights Focus to Upgrade China's International Lending, 5 CHINESE J.

As it appears, the most inexplicably e lusive feature of the BRI, taken alongside China's articulated philosophy and normative approach to what it asserts as the content of the right to development, is not just the presence of a so -called \"rule of law -based\" sovereign development financing para digm,102 but an actual predictable legal and contractual framework for assessing project responsibility and the assumption of project, operational, political, credit, regulatory, and other types of risks;103 regularizing joint sovereign oversight over BRI pr ojects;104 and ensuring not just timely and apt piecemeal project completion,105 but the salience of the conceptualization and implementation of BRI projects in full compliance with both domestic and international laws on environment, labor, and other key norms of participation, contribution, enjoyment, and fullest realization of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights that comprise the right to development in international law.106 Close to a decade into the grand speeches and promotional pron ouncements,107 numerous international fora staged,108 and a growing constellation of lionizing commentaries attesting to the vast potentials of the BRI projects for the future of humanity,109 what stands more deafening thus far is China's silence on the role of actual binding law to ensure 102 See Guiguo Wang, Towards a Rules -Based Belt and Road Initiative - Necessity and Directions, 6 J.

In April 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared for the first time that the BRI will \"adopt widely accepted rules and standards and encourage participating companies to follow general international rules and standards in project development, operation, procurement and tendering and bidding. The laws and regulations of participating countries should also be respected.\"111 As of this writing, however, it has not been disclosed what precise international rules, operational standards, and international, regional, or local laws Chinese President Xi Jinping mad e binding or applicable to all BRI Projects. During the COVID -19 pandemic, it has been reported that China has received, and not granted, numerous applications for debt relief from BRI projects, on the reasoning that \"the BRI loans are not foreign aid...[Chi na] need[s] to at least recoup principal and a moderate interest.\"112 There is abundant academic literature speculating on various substantive international rules that may or should apply to the BRI,113 but nothing yet that has been publicly disclosed by China to apply to all the contract language and legal documentation for each BRI Project it has listed in its BRI website. Other documents released in April 2019 along with China's Debt Sustainability Fr amework (such as the Beijing Initiative for the Clean Silk Road,114 the Cooperation Initiative on Silk Road of Innovation,115 and the Green Investment Principles for the Belt and Road116) all have a similar non -binding tenor and articulate visions and princip les, rather than actual hard law applicable to BRI contracts. What is known, is that, as of July 1, 2018, the Supreme People's Court of China issued its \"Regulations on Several Issues Regarding the Establishment of International Commercial Courts\" (one in Xian and one in Shenzhen), which will reportedly take jurisdiction over any disputes involving BRI projects.117 There is no equivalent mechanism set up similar to the World Bank Inspection Panel or other compliance and accountability mechanisms in all other development banks 110 See Working Together to Deliver a Brighter Future for Belt and Road Coopera tion, MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE PEOPLE 'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (Apr. 26, 2019) https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1658424.shtml. 111 Id. 112 James Kynge and Sun Yu, \"China faces wave of calls for debt relief on 'Belt and Road' projects\", The Financial Times, 30 April 2020, full text at https://www.ft.com/content/5a3192be -27c6 -4fe7-87e7 -78d4158bd39b [last accessed 1 May 2020]. 113 See INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA UNDER THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (Yun Zhao ed., 2018); Heng Wang, China's Approach to the Belt and Road Initiative: Scope, Character, and Sustainability , 22 J.

Projects may already be in the process of being initiated,119 but all of the stakeholders to BRI projects beyond China and the BRI debtor governme nt\u2014particularly affected local communities \u2014still remain behind an iron curtain as to crucial information on the long -term governance, social, financial, and fiscal consequences, as well as all the human rights impacts, of all of the BRI projects.120 As illu strated in five case studies of Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Laos, and Kazakhstan in the following Part I ( Democracy and the BRI: Choice, Consent, and Consultation in Sovereign Lending ), the dearth of hard law and transparent and open information regardi ng BRI development projects,121 itself creates significantly problematic deficits in the exercise of informed choice, consultation with local communities, and the process of determining the meaningful consent of all constituencies and stakeholders of BRI de velopment projects. I. DEMOCRACY AND THE BRI: CHOICE , CONSENT , AND CONSULTATION IN SOVEREIGN LENDING Project finance refers to a \"nonrecourse or limited recourse financing structure in which debt, equity, and credit enhancement are combined for the construct ion and operation, or the refinancing of a particular facility in a capital -intensive industry, in which lenders base credit appraisals on the projected revenues from the operation of the facility, rather than the general assets or the credit of the sponso r of the facility, and rely on the assets of the facility, including any revenue -producing contracts and other cash flows generated by the facility, as collateral for debt.\"122 When it is a sovereign state that finances a project in a borrowing state, this introduces even further complexities to the ordinary contractual dynamics of project financing. As Lee Buchheit and Mitu Gulati famously cautioned in 2010: There are three reasons for attempting to reach a common understanding of the responsibilities of s overeign borrowers and their lenders. First, the flow of capital to sovereign debtors is exceptionally important to the world economy. Industrialized countries rely on it to finance their budget deficits, these days to a breathtaking extent. Developing countries need it to develop.

Second, sovereign finance is uniquely unfo rgiving of mistakes . Unlike corporate or personal debtors, sovereigns do not have access to a formal bankruptcy process in which insupportable liabilities can be adjusted according to preestablished rules. From a legal standpoint, sovereign debts are the refore ineradicable absent the consent and cooperation of the creditors. Unfortunately, the process by which that consent and cooperation must be sought - sovereign debt restructuring - remains unpredictable and disorderly. Third, the human cost of prodig al sovereign borrowing, reckless sovereign lending or incompetent sovereign debt restructuring is incalculable ...A consensus about the responsibilities of sovereign borrowers and lenders, together with improvements in the way in which sovereign loans are planned, executed, documented, and, when necessary, restructured, will directly affect the lives of most of the people that live on this planet.\"123 The above three reasons make it all the more crucial that there is transparency of information124 for all BRI p roject stakeholders \u2014not just the finance ministry of the borrowing state, but affected local communities, taxpayers, civil society organizations, and all other constituencies impacted by a borrowing state incurring foreign debt through a BRI project.125 Be cause these are long -term and intergenerational commitments by the government of a borrowing BRI state to repay China over time \u2014either through the allocation of infrastructure, energy, mining, communications, or other project revenues, or through China's r ecovery or repayment of debt from the actual assets and resources comprising the facilities of the project (whether through outright ownership of the assets or enjoyment of other associated long -term property rights such as usufructuary rights, long -term l eases, among others over such assets, resources, and facilities) \u2014the civilian populations of BRI borrowing states have a direct stake over the consent that their government ultimately gives to owe debt to China that would be used for the construction of BR I megaprojects.126 Since 123 Lee C.

Researchers have found that \"better fiscal transparency, political trust, and credit ratings are connected with a lower cost of sovereign debt...higher corruption, bu dget deficits, current account deficits, and unemployment make sovereign rates increase.\"128 Other researchers also affirm that \"high debt levels can limit a sovereign government's capacity to provide social services necessary for the well -being of its citi zens, and divert resources and energy from the pursuit of long - term development strategies...[and] after a government defaults, the mechanisms for managing the restructuring of sovereign debt usually act slowly, do not return the country to debt sustainabili ty, and often leave the different classes of creditors as well as the people of the indebted country feeling as if they have been treated unfairly.\"129 Genuine, ongoing, and transparent consultations with affected local communities130 of BRI development proj ects are as equally important as securing the informed consent of, and ensuring meaningful choice by, all actual stakeholders and constituencies of BRI debt to China to finance such development projects. The emerging right to development emphasizes partici pation , contribution , and enjoyment by all persons and peoples in economic, political, social, and cultural development that ensures the realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.131 Even the right to self -determination in Article 1(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (to which China is a treaty party) requires that peoples possess both \" the right to freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social, and cultural development. \"132 The freedom to pursue such development \u2014howsoever envisaged \u2014is undermined when affected communities and peoples do not have transparent access to information about the BRI projects and their likely or anticipated human rights impacts. Precisely because affected stakeholders, local communities, and wider constituencies in the borrower BRI state stand to absorb all of the impacts, externalities, and consequences of BRI development projects, they cannot be left out of the process of BRI pr oject overall project coordination costs for handling overall project complexity through partitioning of the project into more or less autonomous subprojects. Further, 'Global Megaprojects' also involve significant levels of cross - institutional complexity because they involve participants and outside groups from multiple countries with differing languages and institutions.\"). 127 Weizhen Tan, China's Loans to Other Countries are Causing 'Hidden' Debt.

Malaysia's East Coast Rail L ink (ECRL) In late 2018, Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, announced the cancellation of three BRI infrastructure projects (the East Coast Rail Link connecting the South China Sea with shipping routes in Malaysia's western provinces, and two gas pipeline projects),140 raising concerns over possible bankruptcy and the terms of repayment to China. The East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) would connect Malaysia's Port Klang on the Strait of Malacca with Kelantan on the Gulf of Thailand.141 After many negotiatio ns over a year, China and Malaysia announced in July 2019 that they are restarting the ECRL railway project, after project costs were reduced by a third, to USD$10.7 Billion.142 Malaysia Rail Link will operate the project in a 50:50 joint venture with China Communications Construction Company, subject to the regulatory supervision of Malaysia's Ministry of Transport.143 Construction had started in August 2017, and the expected completion date is 2026. The renegotiation of the cost, however, did not affect the terms of the original November 2016 Engineering, Procurement, Construction, and Commissioning (EPCC) Agreement.144 While the Land Public Transport agency of the Malaysian Government had conducted market consultations with respect to proposed business, tech nical models, and procurement strategies for this project,145 the full extent and nature of community consultations conducted for the ECRL is not yet known,146 even as Malaysia's regional 140 Amanda Erickson, Malaysia Cancels Two Big Chinese Projects, Fearing they will Bankrupt the Country , WASH.

Instead, Malay sia Rail Link committed to \"mainstreaming environmental protection into the Project and towards self -regulation to ensure that the quality of the environment is protected during the construction of and operation of ECRL. MRL will ensure organizational comm itment to environmental regulatory compliance by all personnel at all levels of the organization, including its consultants, contractors, suppliers, and all other parties involved in the Project implementation. MRL is also committed to continuous communica tion and engagement with all stakeholders throughout the life of the Project.\"156 Nothing in the 2017 EIA Report indicated that local communities impacted by the East Coast Rail Link project could have direct recourse to ensure the accountability of MRL an d all parties involved in the Project's implementation, for any environmental, social, and human rights impacts. b.

Similarly, the Octobe r 2017 EIA did not indicate the nature and contents of the community consultation process, nor the manner by which local communities would be engaged as actual development partners in monitoring the project. The focus of the October 2017 EIA was largely on providing proposed mitigation measures for anticipated impacts on air quality, noise and vibration, water quality, biodiversity, traffic management, water and sewerage management, solid waste management, archaeology and heritage, landscape, energy, and na tural as well as man -made disaster management.170 Even as fishing communities and environmental groups in Sri Lanka continue to object to the ongoing construction of the Colombo Port City metropolis on reclaimed land,171 it is not shown from the project docu mentation if these communities are even considered as actual 165 See Ning Shengnan, Rethinking the External Debt Issue of Sri Lanka: Causes and Implications , 74 CHINA INT'L STUD. 138 (2019); Bhagya Senaratne, Enhancing China's Overseas through Public Diplomacy , 72 CHINA INT'L STUD. 166, 173 (2018). 166 See Patrick Mendis, Destiny of the Pearl: How Sri Lanka's Colombo Consensus Trump ed Beijing and Washington in the Indian Ocean , 7 YALE J.

Laos' Kunming -Vientiane Railway The Kunming -Vientiane Railway project is a 414 kilometer railway line between China's Yunnan provincial capital of Kunming and the Laotian capital of Vientiane, estimated at a project cost of aro und USD$7 Billion.182 This is an extremely significant project cost, since Laos remains \"one of Southeast Asia's poorest countries...[with annual Gross Domestic Product of just USD$16 Billion]...[O]f the [estimated] USD$6 Billion cost for the China -Laos railway , the Chinese government will pay 70 percent. Laos will pay the remaining 30 percent with loans from Chinese financial institutions.\"183 The Kunming - Vientiane Railway is intended to \"connect south to lines in Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore.\"184 The Finan cial Times reported that this project was \"carried out with little public consultation. . . . Laos's government has taken on $480m of loans from China's Eximbank, on concessional terms. The amount is equivalent to about 2 per cent of Laos's gross domestic product. However, the IMF classifies Laos as a country with an 'elevated' risk of debt distress because of its high existing debt, which amounts to nearly 65 per cent of GDP. The project's backers have not made the business plan public, so little is known about its assumptions of how many passengers will use the train. . . . [T]he main problem is that the high-speed train is driven by a political economy agenda that serves the promoting nation much more than the recipient country. . . . Apart from the debt incurred by Laos, it will also be very difficult for the Lao private sector to gain benefit from this new infrastructure, as they are less competitive than the Chinese -related business ecosystem.\"185 181 See Shamsa Kanwal et. al., China -Pakistan Economic Corridor Projects Development in Pakistan: Local Citizens Benefits Perspective, 19 J.

Khorgos will soon enter the record books as home to the world's biggest dry port. Perhaps appropriately, Khorgos occupies one of the furthest points on Earth from any ocean.\"187 186SCOTT MORRIS ,THE KUNMING -VIENTIANE RAILWAY :THE ECONOMIC ,PROCUREMENT ,LABOR ,AND SAFEGUARDS DIMENSIONS OF A CHINESE BELT AND ROAD PROJECT 1 (2019). 187Khorgos: The Biggest Dry Port in The World: A Visu al Explainer ,S.CHINA MORNING POST, https://multimedia.scmp.com/news/china/article/One -Belt-One-Road/khorgos.html (last visited Jan. 15, 2020). 2020 THE COMPLEXITIES OF DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE 338 The Khorg os Gateway combines a dry port and special economic zone that has been described as a \"much less transformative project than its proponents believe...Khorgos is less of a global hub for trade than a regional rail terminal for Chinese goods to Russia and Cent ral Asia.\"188 Beyond the reported economic underperformance of the Khorgos Gateway, scarcely anything has been reported about the environmental impacts of the project, a problematic information deficit, considering that Khorgos falls squarely within biodive rsity hotspots identified by the World Bank:189 188 Henry Ruehl, The Khorgos Hype on the Belt and Road , THE DIPLOMAT (Sept. 27, 2019), https://thediplomat.com/20 19/09/the 189 Ehsan Masood, Redrawing the Map of World Science , NATURE (May 1, 2019), https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586 -019-01124 -7/index.html?fbclid=IwAR173whGJs6FqZJ7THpzP - Wcp3RDdBMH1RrdA_VcqgmL7mEK_r3 3tJ_TsFQ. 339 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace observed that the Khorgos Gateway provokes deep societal concerns at grassroots level. In Kazakhstan, there is a clear veil of reticence towards the Chinese embrace. It is due to a mix of popular ignorance (no one knows exactly how many Chinese live in Kazakhstan) and disinformation. The availability of new information and direct experience of dealing with the Chinese at different levels and travel contribute to a better sense of goodwill and trust . . . but the picture is diverse, mixed and dynamic, and growing familiarity does not necessarily lead to greater amity and trust. Although there have been few public surveys on the issue, experts and offici als during conversations report a palpable anxiety on the part of the locals [with] main fears in the Kazakh society: the first is that there will be an 'invasion' of Chinese migrants who will settle and take away local jobs. The second is that China will start questioning the border agreements and suddenly demand more land.\"190 190 Philippe Le Corre, Kazakhs Wary of Chinese Embrace as BRI Gathers Steam , CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INT'L PEACE (Feb. -of-chinese -embrace - as-bri-gathers -steam -pub-78545. 2020 THE COMPLEXITIES OF DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE 340 The absence of transparency of information and open public consultations with all affected local communities as to the environmental, climate change, social, labor, and human rights impacts of Kazakhstan's Khorgos Gateway likewise does not assuage any of the local community anxieties191 over this project. As the above five case studies demonstrate, BRI projects themselves represent the infusion of China's vast surplus capital on largely non -transparent and information -sparse commercial, operational, debt repayment, and project implementation terms to civilian populations in BRI debtor states. The development model fostered under the BRI relies heavily on state to state interactio ns, with China largely leaving it to the BRI debtor state to be accountable to its own civilian population. Disputes involving the BRI projects are confidentially negotiated at the highest level of the Chinese government and the BRI debtor state's governme nt, and often beyond the purview of public transparency and third -party scrutiny by civil society organizations. The 'democratic' nature of the BRI is to be seen mainly from the official consent of the BRI debtor government to the terms set by China as the BRI's sovereign lender, on the assumption that BRI debtor governments functionally respond to and consult their own local constituencies and project stakeholders. This lens of 'democracy' in financing development projects is problematic, and does not meet international standards requiring transparency, full stakeholder participation, and the broadest range of due diligence for environmental, social, labor, and other human rights - related impacts from international development projects. The 2002 United Natio ns Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development stressed the importance of transparent and accountable systems for mobilizing resources for development, as well as the shared responsibility of debtors and creditors for preventing and resolving unsustai nable debt situations: An effective, efficient, transparent, and accountable system for mobilizing public resources and managing their use by Governments is essential. . . . While Governments provide the framework for their operation, businesses, for thei r part, are expected to engage as reliable and consistent partners in the development process. We urge businesses to take into account not only the economic and financial but also the developmental, social, gender, and environmental implications of their u ndertakings. . . . Sustainable debt financing is an important element for mobilizing resources for public and private investment. . . . Debtors and creditors must share responsibility for preventing and resolving unsustainable debt situations.192 The UNCT AD Consolidated Principles on Promoting Responsible Sovereign Lending and Borrowing are also particularly apropos with respect to China's role as the sovereign 191 See Reid Sta ndish, China's Path Forward is Getting Bumpy , ATLANTIC (Oct. 1, 2019), https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/10/china -belt-road-initiative -problems - kazakhstan/597853/. 192 Emphasis added.

A/CONF.198/11, annex I (Mar. 2002). 341 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 lender in the BRI, given its current largely \"hands -off\" approach to how BRI debtor governments incur debt and make fiscal decisions for BRI projects: Responsibilities of Lenders 1. Agency : Lenders should recognize that government officials involved in sovereign lending and borrowing transactions are responsible for protecting public interest (to the S tate and citizens for which they are acting as agents). Lenders to sovereign borrowers are dealing with agents (the government officials directly involved in the borrowing process) who owe responsibility to the State to its citizens for which they act. An y attempt by a lender to suborn a government official to breach that duty is wrongful (for example, instances of bribes or corruption). 2. Informed Decisions : Lenders have a responsibility to provide information to their sovereign customers to assist borrowers in making informed credit decisions . Applicable due diligence standards should be followed by lenders including reasonable steps to ensure that the sovereign understands the risks and benefits of the financial product being offered. The level of financial sophistication among sovereigns differs widely. Some are well informed about markets and financial techniques, others less so. The lender's responsibility increases when dealing with an unsophisticated sovereign counterparty. 3. Due Authorization : Lenders have a responsibility to determine, to the best of their abilities, whether the financing has been appropriately authorized and whether the resulting credit agreements are valid and enforceable under relevant jurisdiction(s) . A lender has an ind ependent duty to ensure to the best of its ability, that the government officials are authorized under applicable law to enter into the transaction and that the arrangement is otherwise consistent with such law. Should the lender determine that these cond itions do not exist, it should desist from concluding the agreement. 4. Responsible credit decisions: a lender is responsible to make a realistic assessment of the sovereign borrower's capacity to service a loan based on the best available information and fol lowing agreed technical rules on due diligence and national accounts. Lending beyond a borrower's reasonable capacity to repay not only risks a default on the loan in question, it adversely affects the position of all other creditors of that sovereign deb tor. When assessing the borrower's situation, lenders should consider the broad and real 2020 THE COMPLEXITIES OF DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE 342 financial scenario, including direct and contingent liabilities according to the System of National Accounts adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission. In a transaction in which a lender is motivated solely by commercial considerations, the lender should have a direct economic interest in assessing the borrower's repayment capacity. Credits extended to sovereign borrowers as a means of enhancing a bilatera l lender's geopolitical influence, however, will involve other motivations...The desire to realize such benefits from a financing transaction should not replace a serious assessment of the borrower's repayment capacity. Lending decisions are critically depe ndent on the willingness of borrowers to provide timely and accurate information. 5. Project financing: Lenders financing a project in the debtor country have a responsibility perform their own ex ante investigation into and, when applicable, post -disbursemen t monitoring of, the likely effects of the project, including its financial, operational, civil, social, cultural, and environmental implications. This responsibility should be proportional to the technical expertise of the lender and the amount of funds to be lent. In the context of project financing, a lender carries some of the responsibility for the reasonably foreseeable effects of the project and the host government shares a corresponding responsibility. When applicable, this investigation will nor mally include post -disbursement monitoring of the use of the proceeds of the loan...This monitoring should be transparent and not affect any sovereign's faculty to decide on its developmental priorities. 6. International cooperation: all lenders have a duty to comply with United Nations sanctions imposed against a governmental regime. UN sanctions are imposed against a state in order to maintain or restore international peace and security. In instances of serious misconduct where sanctions are deemed to be necessary, lenders should not participate in financial transactions that evade or hamper such sanctions. 7. Debt restructurings: in circumstances where a sovereign is manifestly unable to service its debts, all lenders have a duty to behave in good faith and wi th cooperative spirit to reach a consensual re - 343 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 arrangement of those obligations. Creditors should seek a speedy and orderly resolution to the problem.193 Recalling that Chinese President Xi Jinping committed in April 2019 to ensure adoption and implemen tation of all international rules and standards for BRI projects,194 greater confidence can be expected from BRI project financing if China internalizes both the Monterrey Consensus and the UNCTAD Consolidated Principles as part of the binding applicable la w to its BRI projects. By assuming legal responsibility as potentially the world's largest single sovereign lender for all BRI projects, China could more authentically advance a responsible democratic vision for the BRI premised on the meaningful choices, informed consent, and regular community engagement and consultation with the affected civilian populations and local communities impacted by BRI projects, instead of relying largely on the capacities and political wherewithal of BRI debtor governments. A truly \"win -win cooperation\" to realize the right to development, as defined in Article 1(1) of the 1986 United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development, would hearken back to the participation, contribution, and enjoyment of all persons and peoples in the economic, political, social, and cultural development that realizes all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Beijing Consensus could outpace the Washington Consensus in this regard, if China commits to internalizing as hard law for all BRI p rojects the above international standards and norms ensuring the responsibility of sovereign lenders, as well as international standards of full information transparency and operational accountability to all project stakeholders beyond that of a BRI debtor government \u2014affected local communities, civil society organizations, and all other groups absorbing the environmental, social, and human rights impacts of BRI development projects in the short and long run. Transparency and operational accountability, afte r all, are part and parcel of what China has already committed to as a treaty party to the ICESCR; the Paris Agreement; as part of China's Third Universal Periodic Review commitments to the Human Rights Council; as part of China's own domestic rules and re gulations; and most importantly, as the binding pronouncement of Chinese President Xi Jinping to subject the BRI to all applicable international standards to international development projects. II. DEVELOPMENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE BRI: PARTICIPATION , TRANSP ARENCY , MONITORING , IMPACTS To reiterate, China is a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), signing this treaty on October 27, 1997 and ratifying the same on March 27, 2001.195 This reinforces China's responsi bilities to maintain oversight over BRI projects, and particularly to ensure that Chinese state -owned companies and other Chinese firms implementing BRI projects in the territories of BRI debtor states are acting in ways that are fully consistent with the ICESCR. Consistent with the obligations to respect, protect, 193 Emphasis added. U.N.

At the very least, well beyond China's voluminous non -binding documentation on its vision for BRI projects, it should already be requiring human ri ghts due diligence198 to be conducted by all Chinese state -owned companies and private Chinese firms implementing and operating BRI projects. Human Rights Watch understandably called for transparency and public consultations to ensure that BRI projects full y respect human rights,199 precisely in a climate where China's promotion of the BRI does not include complete disclosure of all information enabling public analysis of the human rights impacts of BRI projects. While the China Development Bank and China Export -Import Bank released its January 2016 Emerging Sustainability Frameworks document,200 the standards indicated therein for environmental review made no reference to any international environmental treaty commitments of China and the BRI debtor state or actual domestic environmen tal law, with the document vaguely referring only to China's possible inclusion of \"environmental and social responsibilities...in [a] loan contract.\"201 In the conduct of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for overseas projects, the same document refers to the host country's environmental policies and standards for evaluation, and \"[w]hen the host country does not 196 Comm. on Econ., Soc. and Cultural Rights, UN.

There is increasing urgency for China to exercise regular institutional oversight over the role of its state -owned companies and other Chinese firm s in BRI projects, given reports of various environmental, labor, and human rights impacts.

Thus far, China has largely favored loans over grants. It is not a member of th e Paris Club of major creditor nations, and it has shown little inclination to adhere to internationally recognized norms of debt sustainability, such as the sovereign lending principles issued by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. At the same time, many of the recipient countries participating in the project lack the capability to assess the long - term financial consequences of China's loans - or they may simply accept them, assuming the bills will come due on a future government's wat ch... Ballooning, unsustainable debt is the predictable result. Sri Lanka, where in 2017, some 95 percent of government revenue went to debt repayment, represents the best -known example of Belt and Road's negative impact on a country's balance sheet. But Sri Lanka is only the most prominent case; a recent study by the Center for Global Development identified eight countries \u2014 Djibouti, the Maldives, Laos, Montenegro, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Pakistan \u2014 that are at particular risk of debt distress due to future Belt and Road -related financing. Naturally, large government -backed loans to foreign countries come with political strings attached. The potentially destructive international economic consequences of failing to make repayments breeds long -term dependence on China and expands Beijing's influence. As a result, recipient countries will find their foreign -policy choices constrained \u2014 even if future governments seek to exit Beijing's orbit.... The Belt and Road Initiative provides a vector through which China can exert influence well beyond countries' foreign policy choices. The geographic expanse covered by the initiative includes many nations with high levels of corruption, and with domestic institutions that range from fragile democracies to ful l-blown autocracies. With Chinese companies being generally less transparent than their international peers, and with Beijing's zeal to curb bribery and corporate malfeasance limited to its domestic economy, a massive influx of Chinese funds into countries with weak governance is likely to exacerbate ongoing corruption problems. And given that some projects are clearly linked to geopolitical objectives \u2014 like gaining control over commercial assets with potential military uses \u2014 Beijing may well employ graft to ensure that foreign political elites look favourably on its offers. 347 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 China's planned development of a \"new digital Silk Road has received comparatively less attention than other elements of the initiative but is equally troubling. China's digital bluep rint seeks to promote information technology connectivity across the Indian Ocean rim and Eurasia through new fiber optic lines, undersea cables, cloud computing capacity and even artificial intelligence research centers. If realized, this ambitious visio n will serve to export elements of Beijing's surveillance regime. Indeed, Chinese technology companies already have a track record of aiding repressive governments. In Ethiopia, likely prior to the advent of Belt and Road, the Washington Post reports that China's ZTE Corporation \"sold technology and provided training to monitor mobile phones and Internet activity.\" Today, Chinese tech giant Huawei is partnering with the government of Kenya to construct \"safe cities\" that leverage thousands of surveillance c ameras feeding data into a public security cloud \"to keep an eye on what is going on generally\" according to the company's promotional materials. Not all elements of China's domestic surveillance regime are exportable, but as the \"New Digital Silk Road\" ta kes shape, the public and online spaces of countries along it will become less free. Beyond fueling corruption and enhancing surveillance, the initiative will stifle free speech, at a minimum by strengthening Beijing's ability to silence criticism. States financially beholden to China will become less willing to call out Beijing's domestic human rights abuses, for instance, and less eager to object to its foreign -policy practices. This dynamic is already playing out within the European Union. In mid -2017, for the first time, the EU failed to issue a joint condemnation of China at the U.N. Human Rights Council. Greece, which had recently received a massive influx of Chinese investment into its Port of Piraeus, scuttled the EU statement. Other cash -strapped democratic governments, when confronting the choice between Belt and Road's immediate - even if one - sided - economic benefits and the need to defend human rights globally, may well follow Greece's example. Similarly, companies dependent on the Chinese mark et are already acquiescing to Beijing's demands - such as by firing an American employee who \"liked\" a pro -Tibetan independence tweet - and by self -censoring, as in the efforts by some Hollywood producers to ensure that films contain no lines (supportive o f Tibet, say, or critical of Xi Jinping) that might arouse anger within the Chinese Communist Party. As the initiative extends its reach, it is easy to imagine government officials feeling similarly compelled.\"205 205 Richard Fontaine & Daniel Kliman, On China's New Silk Road, Democracy Pays a Toll: China's Vast Foreign Investment Program Comes at a Sharp Cost to Human Rights and Good Governance , FOREIGN POL'Y (May 16, 2018), https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/16/on -chinas -new-silk-road-democracy -pays-a-toll/. 2020 THE COMPLEXITIES OF DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE 348 In contrast, however, United Nations Secretary -General Antonio Guterres declared that the BRI could also be an important platform of opportunity to realize the Sustainable Development Goals and commitments on climate change, remarking that the United Nations is \"poised\" to support a BRI that is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals: ...China's leadership on climate action is helping to show the way. New renewable energy jobs in China now outnumber those created in the oil and gas industries. In 2017, China invested over $125 billion in renewable energy, an increase of at least 25 per cent over the previous year. And China's new cutting -edge transmission line that sends electricity along a pathway 600 miles longer than anything built to date is a further potential boon fo r renewables. China also played a pivotal role in building bridges and securing an agreement at last December's United Nations Climate Conference in Katowice \u2014 and will host next year's second Global Sustainable Transport Conference... In moving forward, I would point to three very important opportunities that can be seized. First, the world will benefit from a Belt and Road Initiative that accelerates efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The five pillars of the Belt and Road \u2014 policy coor dination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people - to-people exchanges \u2014 are intrinsically linked to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. These are conceptual pillars that can be translated into real -life progress for al l people. United Nations country teams stand ready to support Member States in capacity - and governance -building, and in achieving a harmonious and sustainable integration of the Belt and Road projects in their own economies and societies in accordance wit h national development plans, anchored in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Second, the world needs to take profit of the Belt and Road Initiative to help close significant financing gaps for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, especial ly in the developing world, in particular, the need for about $1 trillion needed for infrastructure investments in developing countries. This underlines the importance of economic growth that can generate inclusive, sustainable and durable social and environmental gains. Third, I see the Belt and Road Initiative as an important space where green principles can be reflected in green action. Countries today not only require the physical roads and bridges to connect people and markets; they 349 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 need roads and br idges from the unsustainable, fossil -fueled grey economy to a clean, green, low -carbon energy future. Fully expanding our policy options for green and sustainable development backed by green financing instruments must become the new norm. In these three a reas and more, the United Nations is poised to support the alignment of the Belt and Road Initiative with the Sustainable Development Goals, to share knowledge, and to make the most of the opportunities of this large -scale initiative for maximum sustainabl e development dividends. Let us work together to restore trust by making good on the shared promise of the 2030 Agenda and our common commitment to leave no one behind.\"206 As of this writing, it is not yet known whether China has required the conduct of h uman rights impact assessments for all BRI development projects.207 It is also unknown if China has institutionalized human rights due diligence requirements with appropriate, meaningful, and regular consultation and cooperative mechanisms with indigenous p eoples and local communities impacted by BRI development projects, taking into account China's explicit commitments on climate change and commitments to align the BRI with the Sustainable Development Goals.208 Requiring these human rights impact assessments for BRI development projects is arguably well within the purview of China's treaty obligations to protect all rights under the ICESCR. As the CESCR reminded in General Comment No. 24: 16. The obligation to protect entails a positive duty to adopt a legal framework requiring business entities to exercise human rights due diligence in order to identify, prevent and mitigate the risks of violations of Covenant rights, to avoid such rights being abused, and to account for the negative impacts caused or contri buted to by their decisions and operations and those of entities they control on the enjoyment of Covenant rights . States should adopt measures such as imposing due diligence requirements to prevent abuses of Covenant rights in a business entity's supply c hain and by subcontractors, suppliers, franchisees, or other business partners . 17. States parties should ensure that, where appropriate, the impacts of business activities on indigenous peoples specifically (in particular, actual 206 Press Release, Office of the United Nations Secretary -General, United Nations Poised to S upport Alignment of China's Belt and Road Initiative with Sustainable Development Goals, Secretary -General Says at Opening Ceremony U.N.

In exercising human rights due diligence, businesses should consult and coopera te in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through indigenous peoples' own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before the commencement of activities . Such consultations should allow for identifi cation of the potentially negative impact of the activities and of the measures to mitigate and compensate for such impact. They should also lead to design mechanisms for sharing the benefits derived from the activities, since companies are bound by their duty to respect indigenous rights to establish mechanisms that ensure that indigenous peoples share in the benefits generated by the activities developed on their traditional territories. States would violate their duty to protect Covenant rights, for instance, by failing to prevent or to counter conduct by businesses that leads to such rights being abused, or that has the foreseeable effect of leading to such rights being abused , for instance through lowering the criteria for approving new medicines, b y failing to incorporate a requirement linked to reasonable accommodation of persons with disabilities in public contracts, by granting exploration and exploitation permits for natural resources without giving due consideration to the potential adverse imp acts of such activities on the individual and on communities' enjoyment of Covenant rights, by exempting certain projects or certain geographical areas from the application of laws that protect Covenant rights , or by failing to regulate the real estate mar ket and the financial actors operating on that market so as to ensure access to affordable and adequate housing for all. Such violations are facilitated where insufficient safeguards exist to address corruption of public officials or private -to-private cor ruption, or where, as a result of corruption of judges, human rights abuses are left unremedied.\"209 (Italics added.) Thus far, however, China has not released any official documentation showing how it would operationally and legally align all BRI developme nt projects with the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals or the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Following from the April 2019 pronouncement of Chinese President Xi Jinping that the BRI would adopt all international laws, rules, and standards for b est practices in development -financed projects,210 it would be consistent with this pronouncement (and wisely respond to many 209 Comm.

China's ICESCR commitments \u2014which should be implemented domestically by China212\u2014could also be implemented by treating economic, social, and cultural rights under the ICESCR as part of the fabric of domestic \"laws, regulations, policies, and standards\" that China insists must be complied with by any foreign investment, in order to qualify for protective coverage in China's around 145 international investment agreements thus far.213 These \"in accordance with law\"214 clauses are present in many Chinese international investment agreements,215 and would help ensure that before any Chinese state -owned companies or other Chinese firms (financiers, operators, contractors, among others) could resort to investor -State arbitration mechanisms against BRI debtor countries (especially those enforcing th eir domestic regulatory prerogatives to protect the environment, ensure respect for human rights, and address any labor and social impacts), these Chinese companies and firms must show that their investment indeed qualifies for protection under an existing 211 See Oliver Ward, Is China Meeting Its Internati onal Environmental and Human Rights Obligations on BRI? , ASEAN TODAY (Apr. 23, 2019), environmental -and-human -rights -obligations See Zou Keyuan, International Law in the Chine se Domestic Context, 44 VAL.

China can show its readiness to ensure compliance with ICESCR commitments, in line with CESCR General Comment No. 24, by purposely recognizing that the host State's international enviro nmental, labor, and all other human rights treaty commitments forms part of that corpus of host State law to which all foreign investments operated by Chinese firms should comply. The absence of clear legal and operational commitments of China under the BR I thus far on ensuring local communities' participation, access, and transparency with respect to BRI project information, as well as the design of an open monitoring system and system for redress within BRI development projects for the actual stakeholders well beyond the governments that sign the contracts for these projects \u2014such as civil society organizations, local communities, indigenous peoples, among others \u2014is particularly problematic for Chinese President Xi Jinping's articulated April 2019 commitmen t that all BRI development projects will follow international rules, norms, standards, and best practices, and especially so for China's binding international legal commitments under the ICESCR , the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, China's own domestic r egulations governing foreign investment activities and foreign lending, and China's specific voluntary commitments made to the Human Rights Council during its Third Universal Periodic Review. CONCLUSION : DEVELOPMENT IS HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS IS DEVE LOPMENT : PATHS FORWARD FOR THE BRI The BRI has the potential for progress, and likewise the potential for peril. On the one hand, China's commitment of massive surplus funds as investment or sovereign loans is an opportunity to access much needed capital for over 70 BRI debtor States around the world, in a manner that may or may not be as stringent with conditionalities associated with other types of foreign loans or foreign direct investment from international financial institutions or external capital ma rkets. Thus far, there has not been any focused and detailed research streams comparing the risks of incurring foreign debt and investment from the \"Beijing Consensus,\" as opposed to historically dominant paradigms under the \"Washington Consensus .\" Both mo dels of development financing have to be scrutinized continuously for their actual human rights impacts on a case by case, project by project basis \u2014from the lens of the ultimate constituencies of foreign investment and debt: the affected civilian populatio ns who not only have to assume the burden of repayment years down the line, but who also have to suffer any negative externalities from these development projects in the hope that these projects truly redound to these populations' rights to development. Admittedly, the right to development, as of this writing, remains pending in treaty form with the draft Convention on the Right to Development,216 and is, at best, argued as a crystallizing or emerging customary norm. But it should be clear that this emerging right is not in the least simply about the narrower scope of \"rights -based approaches to development,\"217 which focus largely on ensuring human rights compliance throughout the process of international 216 See Human Rights Council, Draft Convention on the Right to Development , A/HRC/Wg.2/2 1/2 (Jan. 17, 2020). 217 See Varun Gauri & Siri Gloppen, Human Rights -Based Approaches to Development: Concepts, Evidence, and Policy 485 (Policy Research, Working Paper No. 5938, 2012). 353 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 development aid programming decisions. The right to de velopment is squarely applicable to a country's foreign lending and/or foreign investment policies, precisely because it imposes a clear responsibility to ensure that every person and all peoples participate, contribute, and enjoy economic, political, soci al and cultural development \"in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms [are realized]\"218 or \"that is consistent with or based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\"219 Either way, the right to development speaks not only to the processes of participation, contribution, and enjoyment of development, but with the substantive qualification of human rights and fundamental freedoms as the ultimate premise of development. Soaring skyscrapers, railways, bridges, infrastructure projects, mining projects, energy projects, telecommunications are simply objects of infrastructure, and the employment and economic growth associated with these forms of economic activity cannot be singularly equated with the process and outcomes of human development as conte mplated in the right to development. But would embracing human rights as the premise of the right to development amount to another form of \"human rights imperialism\" characterized by many scholars220 critical about a sense of undue privileging of human ri ghts protection throughout all aspects of national and international life? Are human rights scholars, lawyers, defenders, practitioners, researchers simply imposing human rights standards (Western, or otherwise) on around 70 BRI countries that have decided to accept China's vast credit and investment infusions, presumably out of a sense that the governments of the BRI countries know best how to realize the human rights of their own populations? To ask the question, in my view, is to answer it. The real impe rialism lies with instantiating the State \u2014whether through the BRI borrowing nation or China as the sovereign lender or investor \u2014as somehow the sole or primary bearer of human rights or the gatekeeping entity for the protection of individual or group human rights. Human rights were never vested in governments, but are inherent, indivisible, interdependent, and universal on the premise of the ultimate value of the equal moral worth221\u2014the actual human dignity \u2014 of the individual, his or her relationships and ass ociations and communities, and the whole corpus of individuals, groups, and communities that forms any State's population. Assuming that queries about human rights in State decision -making is somehow 'imperialist' because only the government has the electe d mandate of a population is a static conception of that mandate \u2014at no point, in the delegation of power by the governed to the governors, did we as individuals, groups, local communities and populations of States surrender our continuing ability to hold g overnments to account for the decisions they make. Human rights remains, as it has always been, a residually supreme source of exacting accountability under the social contract.

The availability of information access, transparency, and some procedural or institutional recourse in these settings \u2014no matter how much they are often critiqued \u2014has at least enabled open contestations, conversations, and polemics on development with actual affected communities. The BRI development projects thus far do not appear to possess similar transparency and information accessibility, much more actual environmenta l, social and human rights internalization in the operational rules for project implementation and execution. The absence of this baseline of needed information for affected communities who will have to live with the consequences of the BRI projects conclu ded by their governments with China, itself hollows out any future meaningful or effective remedy or recourse they might have for their felt and lived experiences of any human rights, climate change, and environmental impacts from the BRI projects. Takin g into account Chinese President Xi Jinping's April 2019 declaration to align the BRI will all international laws, rules, standards, and best practices for development -financed investment projects, China's existing treaty commitments under the ICESCR, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, China's expressed support for Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, as well as China's voluntary commitments to the Human Rights Council during China's Third Universal Periodic Review, alongside the emerging or crystal lizing right to development, there should be nothing extraordinary about now taking the path of verifying, monitoring, and ensuring international human rights compliance from the negotiation, planning, implementation up to the full operation of the BRI pro jects. There are many pathways for China to achieve and realize its stated commitments to international human rights and operationalize the same in the BRI in collaboration with the BRI debtor states, the United Nations, and all other affected constituenci es of BRI projects. The 222 See KIRK HERBERTSON ET AL ., A ROADMAP FOR INTEGRATING HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE WORLD BANK GROUP (2010). 223 See ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT & THE WORLD BANK, INTEGRATING HUMAN RIGHTS INTO DEVELOPMENT : DONOR APPROACHES , EXPERIENCES , AND CHALLENGES , (2013). 224 EQUATOR PRINCIPLES , THE EQUATOR PRINCIPLES JULY 2020 (2020). 355 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 following five pathways \u2014each of which can be the object of separate streams of research in sovereign development financing \u2014are sketched for future research: a. Transparency of BRI negotiations with host constituencies. The BRI suffers not just from perceived lack of legitimacy in contemporary opinion or commentaries, but from the vacuum on legal accountability to civilian populations in BRI debtor states, largely because the terms of these BRI development projects are negotiated and concluded in considerable secrecy at the intergovernmental or inter -State level. Rather than engaging in any attempt at global media propaganda or publicity campaigns, China could redress the clamor for transparency by practicing the recommendations o f the UNCTAD Consolidated Principles on Responsible Sovereign Lending and Borrowing in all of its financing contracts for the BRI, ensuring that China's responsibilities as a sovereign borrower include acknowledging the public interest responsibilities of BRI debtor states' government officials; applying due diligence and transparent information to BRI debtor states' many constituencies (and not just finance ministries) to ensure that the terms of BRI financing are clearly understood by all affected communi ties; making realistic assessments of the BRI debtor state's ability to pay, based on comprehensive due diligence including meaningful consultations with affected communities from the prospective BRI development project; ensuring responsible ex -ante and po st-disbursement investigation and monitoring of all the impacts of BRI development projects. b. Joint partnership governance over BRI projects. BRI development projects do not appear to be community -driven, and it is not clear the extent to which affected communities were consulted (if at all) in determining their needs for infrastructure, energy, telecommunications, mining, or all other types of BRI development projects. The long -term nature of BRI development projects makes it clear that China sh ould be partnering not just with BRI debtor governments, but also directly with affected local communities for needs assessment, consultations on project development and implementation, and the monitoring and evaluation of BRI project impacts. It is not en ough for China to leave it to a BRI debtor government to ensure that human rights, climate, change, environmental, labor, social and all other commitments are met in a BRI development project. China's ICESCR obligations are treaty commitments that, as elab orated in General Comment No. 24,225 makes it imperative for a sovereign lender or investor such as China to take an active hand in ensuring that all human rights of affected populations are respected, protected, facilitated or fulfilled, and that any human rights violations committed in a BRI development project could be remedied either under the BRI debtor state's domestic law and institutions or under international human rights law. Treating affected communities equally as local partners in BRI developmen t projects \u2014with full transparency, meaningful 225 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Ri ghts, General Comment No. 24 (2017) on State obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights in the context of business activities, paras. 13, 16, 17, 18, 26 -28, 32 -33, 39, 43 -44. 2020 THE COMPLEXITIES OF DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE 356 consultations, and the community's shared ownership of oversight for project impacts \u2014 would be more consistent with the expectations of participation, contribution, and enjoyment of such economic, cultural, poli tical, and social development and realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms under the right to development. c. Open monitoring and accountability of BRI projects to all affected stakeholders Thus far, there has not been any authoritative mechan ism set up for the resolution of any business and human rights disputes under the BRI development projects. While there has been a steady rise in contract -based arbitrations between China and BRI debtor states,226 China has not announced any direct recourse mechanism for populations that experience human rights, climate change, environmental, labor, or social impacts from BRI development projects. China has announced that Chinese international commercial courts in Xi'an, Shenzhen, and Beijing would adjudicat e BRI disputes,227 these new international commercial courts are wholly composed of judges from China228 and have been subject to some speculation as to their possible impartiality in cross -border disputes of China with BRI borrower states. Moreover, it is d oubtful if the subject -matter jurisdiction of these courts would extend beyond contract claims, into tort claims premised on human rights, environmental, and/or labor violations. China could address this gap by creating a similar accountability mechanism s uch as the World Bank Inspection Panel (or other compliance procedures within the Independent Accountability Mechanisms Network), or it could create the opportunity for affected individuals or communities' direct recourse in the BRI contracts themselves th rough adoption of the Hague Rules for Business and Human Rights Arbitration.229 d.

As seen in the five case studies featured in this paper, such reports of environmental and social impact assessments are variably and thinly available. China could centralize data and documentation on the BRI and make the same openly accessible to all BRI debtor States, but also the United Nations and human rights treaty bodies \u2014which could assist in tracking performance of commitments under Agenda 2030, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the ICESCR, and international human rights obligations . e. Embedded human rights auditing In the long -term, China could foreseeably anticipate any regulatory changes that could occur from BRI debtor states' enforcement of environmental, labor, social, and all other human rights laws to BRI development projects \u2014and especially in a manner that would not adversely affect project risks or anticipated investment returns \u2014if China itself were to deliberately embed comprehensive pre - and post -human right auditing230 throughout the operation of a BRI development project. T his would track not just individualized human rights impacts from project implementation, but from the time of project negotiation all the way to the debt repayment terms and conditions for BRI financing. China's \"Beijing Consensus\" model of development fi nancing and investment lending, as exemplified in the BRI, demonstrates a vast gulf thus far between China's articulated commitments (under the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, climate change law, international human rights law, and the right to de velopment, China's domestic regulations on overseas investment, and Chinese President Xi Jinping's April 2019 declaration aligning the BRI with all international norms, standards, rules, and best practices) and the paucity of information about the contract ual, legal, technical, environmental, and human rights dimensions of BRI development projects. Whether the gulf is intentional, motivated by geopolitics, a strategy by design, or paradigmatic in the fluidity of the BRI, is not the concern of this paper. Ch ina has already declared its commitments to align the BRI with treaties and agreements on international human rights, climate change, sustainable development, alongside all international best practices. Deficits remain in the ability of populations to exercise meaningful democratic choices over development decisions in the BRI; obtain the fullest picture of the development consequences and externalities of BRI projects; and investigate the facts of human rights impacts or situations that are arising (or hav e arisen or may yet arise) from BRI projects. Likewise, borrower States in the BRI have the counterpart legal obligations towards their populations, to ensure that their assumption of sovereign debts under the terms China sets in the BRI do not in any way impede or imperil the enjoyment, respect, protection, or fulfillment of their civil, political, economic, and social and cultural rights of present and future generations.231 China (whether in its role as creditor) and other States (as borrowers in BRI proj ects) each have crucial roles to cooperate, coordinate, and 230 Diane A.

If indeed it were to someday internalize such international human rights law protections, the BRI could powerfully realize the authentic right to development of communities around the world. This paper has sought to identify key deficits, but also to articulate feasible pathways, for operationalizing international human rights law in the BRI, in order to clarify and assist in removing its many complexities for the democracy, development, and human rights of the populations of over 70 BRI states for generations to come. Silence in the face of such glaring complexities would have bee n the real face of 'imperialism.'

A critique of the concept of su ch a progression must underlie any criticism of the concept of progress itself.\" \u2014Walter Benjamin, On the Concept of History3 Abstract Sexual and gender -based violence is prevalent in armed conflicts throughout all corners of the world. The elevation \u2014and recognition \u2014of sexual and gender -based violence as violence qua violence is an arduous and continual struggle. Although international humanitarian and human rights law purports to proscribe sexual and gender -based violence, the language of the law often minimizes the gravity of this violence and fails to hold perpetrators accountable. This Article argues that to elevate sexual and gender -based violence crimes in the international humanitarian and criminal law hierarchy, there must be a radical reconceptualization of gender under international law. But, in order to envision the future of sexual and gender -based violence prosecutions, it is i mperative to critically examine its past. At its heart, this Article is a jurisprudential genealogy that traces the development of international feminist activism, culminating in the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice's language negotiations of the Rome St atute for the International Criminal Court. The Caucus sought to deinstitutionalize legal language from archaic heteropatriarchal norms that classify sexual and gender -based violence as chiefly a harm to honor in favor of language that emphasizes the gravi ty of the violence itself and actual individualized harm inflicted on victims. This Article further contends that the Caucus uniquely benefitted from the human rights wave of the 1990s and the fortuitous confluence of gender mainstreaming, international cr iminal tribunals, and the Rome Conference itself. A critical examination of the successes and defeats of the Caucus provides a window into the Rome Statute's inadequate conceptual dealings with gender and illuminates a way forward to recognizing sexual and gender -based violence as violence qua violence. 2 SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR , THE SECOND SEX 849 (Constance Borde & Sheila Malovany -Chevallier trans., 2009). 3 WALTER BENJAMIN , On the Concept of History , in WALTER BENJAMIN : SELECTED WRITINGS , VOLUME 4: 1938 -1940 394-95 (Howard Eiland & Michael W.

Despite the prevalence of this violence, these acts have been relegated to the peripheral backwaters of international humanitarian law. The elevation \u2014and recognition \u2014of sexual and gender -based violence qua violence has been an arduous and continual struggle. Much of this can be attributed to the patriarchal dominati on of legal systems and the relative absence of women at the drafting table.4 When sexual and gender -based violence (SGBV) was addressed in international humanitarian law (IHL), it was associated with archaic conceptions of morality that dismiss the indiv idualized violence of the act. With the advent of the ad hoc tribunals of the 1990s, SGBV crimes have begun to be incorporated into the law as standalone war crimes and crimes against humanity. Further, these advancements were only achieved as a result of feminist theorists and activists advocating for the elevation of SGBV crimes. The Women's Caucus for Gender Justice (WCGJ) was formed in preparation for the Rome Conference in order to advocate for principles of gender justice and accountability for SGBV a t the International Criminal Court. The progress made by the WCGJ was acutely influenced by a fortuitous confluence of events5 in international politics and is the product of the 1990s human rights wave.6 The end of the Cold War distinctly altered the relationship between civil society and states: non -governmental organizations (NGOs) operated as tight networks and coupled their activism with legal action. At the same time, the human rights movement adopted anti - impunity measures and sought to prosecute human rights violators. The breakdown of multi - ethnic states and the human rights violations that followed catalyzed widespread acceptance 4 DIANE MARIE AMANN , Politics and Prosecutions, from Katherine Fite to Fatou Bensouda , in PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN DIALOGS 7 (Elizabeth Anderson & David M. Crane eds., 2012). 5 For lack of a better term, the three periods of time discussed in this project will be referred to as \"events.\" This choice of words is inspired by Michel Foucault 's conception of \"events\" in his essay Nietzsche, Genealogy, History : An entire historical tradition (theological or rationalistic) aims at dissolving the singular event into an ideal continuity \u2014as a teleological movement or a natural process. \"Effective\" history, however, deals with events in terms of their most unique characteristics, their most acute manifestations. An event, consequentially, is not a decision, a treaty, a reign, or a battle, but the reversal of a relationship of forces, the usurpation o f power, the appropriation of a vocabulary turned against those who had once used it, a feeble domination that poisons itself as it grows lax, the entry of the masked \"other.\" The forces operating in history are not controlled by destiny or regulative mech anisms, but respond to haphazard conflicts. They do not manifest the successive forms of a primordial intention and their attraction is not that of a conclusion, for they always appear through the singular randomness of events. . . . The world we know is n ot this ultimately simple configuration where the events are reduced to accentuate their final traits, their final meaning, or their initial and final value. On the contrary, it is a profusion of entangled events. MICHEL FOUCAULT , Nietzsche, Genealogy, History , in THE FOUCAULT READER 88-89 (Paul Rabinow, ed., Vintage Books 2010) (emphasis added). 6 Author's term. 365 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 of human rights norms7 and the anti -impunity model as an attempt to address past wrongs. At the same time, the 1990s were marked by an explosion of international non -governmental organizations.8 Transnational advocacy networks, whose goal is t o alter the behavior of international actors by \"pressuring target[s] . . . to adopt new policies, and by monitoring compliance with international standards,\" have become ubiquitous in activism.9 While advocacy networks may be traced back to slavery aboli tion campaigns, the establishment of the United Nations and the rapid growth of NGOs catapulted transnational advocacy networks into the international spotlight during the late twentieth century. The human rights wave is the result of paradigm shifts appro aching the new millennium.10 The transnational women's network grew from the human rights wave, embracing the normative shift towards anti-impunity with specific regard to SGBV. As this was unfolding, the transnational women's network became a powerful f orce at United Nations conferences and international criminal tribunals. The 1990s brought about a significant shift in human rights norms and canonized anti -impunity as a prevailing mechanism for the human rights movement. The WCGJ fortuitously arose from the confluence of these events and was capable of altering the language of the Rome Statute. Three distinct, yet interdependent, events provided the foundation for the WCGJ: gender mainstreaming at United Nations conferences, the rise of international cri minal tribunals, and the Rome Conference itself. The deeply interconnected nature of these events, in conjunction with the normative shifts of the 1990s, made it possible for the transnational women's network to flourish at this point in time. There is a wide breadth of literature on the transnational women's network at the United Nations, international criminal tribunals, and the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice; however, there is little academic work yoking together these three interconnected \"events.\"11 This project is at its core a jurisprudential genealogy: it seeks to tell the story of the first modern human rights network and its transformation by the consequences of the epochal ruptures of the 1990s, necessitating thick descriptions of events.12 This Article will trace the 7 See Stefan -Ludwig Hoffmann, Human Rights and History , 232 PAST & PRESENT 279, 294 (2016) (stating that a response to the failure of the international community to prevent the \"violent, catastrophic civil wars, [led to] the belated embrace of the idea of human rights interventionism. . . .\"). 8 See The Non -Governmental Order: Will NGOs Democratize, or Merely Disrupt, Global Governanc e?, ECONOMIST (Dec. 9, 1999), https://www.economist.com/special/1999/12/9/the -non-governmental -order (estimating that international nongovernmental organizations rose from 6,000 in 1990 to 26,000 in 1996). 9 MARGARET E. KECK & KATHRYN SIKKINK , ACTIVISTS BEYOND BORDERS : ADVOCACY NETWORKS IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS 3 (1998). 10 See Hoffmann, supra note 7, at 283 (\"[T]he rise of human rights . . . can be understood in part as a result of the fracturing modern time regime.\"). 11 Literature that discusses one or t wo of these three events covered in this project exists. For example, Janet Halley extensively analyzed the ad hoc tribunals and the WCGJ at the ICC but did not include a review of the transnational women's network at United Nations conferences. Janet Halley, Rape at Rome: Feminist Interventions in the Criminalization of Sex -Related Violence in Positive International Criminal Law , 30 MICH. J. INT'L L. 1, 2 (2008). This project aims to weave the three together. 12 The concept of a jurisprudential genealogy harkens back to Foucault and Nietzsche's philosophical tradition of genealogy. This form of genealogy questions comm only understood social beliefs and looks toward the conditions of their possibilities, \"requir[ing] patience and a knowledge of details, and . . . depends on a vast accumulation of source material.\" FOUCAULT , supra note 5, at 76.

This Article proceeds in four Parts. Part I will address the theoretical contours of the human rights wave and the conditions that caused its swell: humanitarian interventionism, individuals as subject s of international law, and the justice cascade. Part I will also flesh out what we mean when we talk about SGBV. Part II will examine the influence of the transnational women's network on international politics, particularly through gender mainstreaming a t mid -twentieth century United Nations conferences. Part III will delve into a thick description of the development of international criminal law that endeavors to hold individual actors accountable for human rights abuses, and the evolution of jurispruden ce addressing SGBV at the ad hoc tribunals. Finally, Part IV will trace the development of the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice and their successes and downfalls during negotiations over gender and violence, illuminating ideological schisms within the group. Additionally, this Article w ill argue that the International Criminal Court has largely been ineffective in meaningfully addressing SGBV in prosecutions. This Article will conclude that the conditions for the WCGJ's successes at Rome were the result of a long genealogy of feminist activism coupled with the fortuitous timing of the human rights wave \u2014monumental paradigm shifts in human rights theory and practice. Without the human rights wave, it is unclear if the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice would have experienced the same level of acceptance into mainstream international governance discourse. linear events and \"opposes itself to the search for 'origins'\"; rather, it is an exploration of the plural and contradictory past and the deconstruction of truth. Id. at 77. These genealogies are a study of the confluence of vicissitude s and accidents at critical times, birthing new epochs and institutions. Nietzsche rejected the pursuit of origin ( Ursprung ) \"because this search assumes the existence of immobile forms that precede the external world of accident and succession.\" Id. at 78 . Rather than relying on fictive objectivity created in modernity from the purportedly suprahistorical perspective of historians, genealogy searches for processes of descent ( Herkunft ) and emergence (Entstehung ), and understands events and contemporary pra ctices through the result of power struggles over domination and meaning: \"Genealogy . . . seeks to reestablish the various systems of subjugation: not the anticipatory power of meaning but the hazardous play of dominations.\" Id. at 83. Emergence, such as the formation of the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice or of prisons, should not be thought of \"as the final term of a historical development,\" but rather \"merely the current episodes in a series of subjugations\" produced by a convergence of forces, \"from substitutions, displacements, disguised conquests, and systematic reversals.\" Id. at 83, 86. \"Humanity does not gradually progress from combat to combat until it arrives at universal reciprocity, where the rule of law finally replaces warfare; humanity ins tills each of its violences in a system of rules and thus proceeds from domination to domination.\" Id. at 85. This Article is an analysis of the aleatory development of prohibitions against sexual and gender -based violence is thus in part a study of the de velopment of humanity through its history of morals and ideals pertaining to gendered violence. Consequentially, this Article is a search for the \"fertile ground,\" the place in which the episteme \u2014the historical conditions of a possibility of a certain disc ourse \u2014changes. In this case, radical shifts in theoretical approaches to sexual and gender -based violence altered institutional discourse on the subject at the Rome Conference. Walter Benjamin's notion of crystallization aids in understanding places of epistemic shift. See BENJAMIN , supra note 3, at 396 (\"Material historiography . . . is based on a constructive principle. Thinking involves not only the movement of thoughts, but their arrest as well. Where thinking suddenly comes to a stop in a constellation saturated with tensions, it gives that constellation a shock, by which thinking is crystallized as a monad.\"). 367 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 I. THEORIZING GENDER , VIOLENCE , AND RIGHTS IN THE FIN DE SI\u00c8CLE a. Defining Sexual and Gender -Based Violence Phrases such as sexual and gender -based violence, violence against women, and gender violence all carry very different meanings.13 By solely referring to certain prohibited acts as \"sexual crimes,\" \"non -sexual attacks on women or men based on their gender -defined roles\"14 are erased. Standard definitions of \"sexual violence\"15 have been more readily accepted under international law than \"gender -based violence\"16 due to the divisive nature of conceiving gender as anything but \"biological sex.\" There is no international agreed upon definition of \"gender -based violence,\"17 and many definitions m ay fall victim to biologically essentialist language that excludes cisgender men and gender non -conforming individuals from its purview. \"Gender -based violence\" must be imagined in an inclusive manner that does not rely on dated conceptions of gender and a ddresses its socially constructed nature.18 A similar problem arises with \"violence against women\": while its focus on \"women\" incorporates gender in some form, it is also heteronormative. As for \"gender violence,\" the term has experienced mild growth from the 1990s to today, consistent with the WCGJ's attempts to include gender violence in the Rome Statute. \"Sexual and gender -based violence\" is less popular, but more inclusive, than \"sexual violence,\" \"violence against women,\" or this: an n -gram graph19 illustrates the growth of violence 13 It is also critical to note that SGBV \"including when conflict -related, often has no relation to sexual desire, but is instead linked to power , dominance and abuse of authority.\" Gloria Gaggioli, Sexual Violence in Armed Conflicts: A Violation of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law , 96 INT'L REV.

Gender -based violence encompasses a broader category of crimes than sexual violence, including domestic violence, rape, sexual exploitation and abuse, forced prostitution, trafficking, forced or early marriage, female gen ital mutilation, honor killings, and compulsory sterilization or abortion.

However, the term \"sexual and gender -based v iolence\" is beginning to be accepted into the mainstream and represents a more intersectional20 approach to these crimes. b. The Fall of the Soviet Union and the Rise of the Human Rights Wave The embrace of individual human rights was uniquely characteristic of the new fin de si\u00e8cle . The human rights wave of the 1990s was vital to the ultimate successes of the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice at Rome and for the transnational women's network a s a whole. The human rights wave can be identified by the rapid growth of international organizations, the newfound enthusiasm for international criminal law, and the amelioration of past wrongs. Academic work pinning the inception of modern human rights i n other time periods, such as the 1970s, often fails to account for the aforementioned attributes of the 1990s.21 Locating the swell of the human rights wave in the 1990s is critical to this project's thesis: without the distinct momentum made in this era, the impact of WCGJ would likely be lessened. The human rights wave as a post -Cold War phenomenon is aptly identified by Stefan - Ludwig Hoffmann. Hoffmann's thesis pushes against Moyn's ascription of human rights as a product of the 1970s and argues that i t occurred later, in the 1990s.22 While the human rights lexicon was present in the 1970s and 1980s,23 it coexisted in conjunction with other \"moral and political idioms like 'solidarity' and included competing notions of rights, which 20 \"Yet intersectionality might be more broadly useful as a way of mediating the tension between assertions of multiple identity and the ongoing necessity of group politics.\" Kimberle Crenshaw, Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Po litics, and Violence Against Women of Color , 43 STAN. L. REV. 1241, 1296 (1991). 21 For example, Samuel Moyn's The Last Utopia argues that the rise of human rights occurred in the 1970s when human rights entered into popular use after the failed uprisings i n the Eastern Bloc, such as the 1968 Prague Spring and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Prior to the 1970s, \"human rights\" was too intertwined with notions of citizenship rights of the Enlightenment, and that \"[c]ontrary to conventional consumptions, there w as no widespread Holocaust consciousness in the postwar era, so human rights could not have been a response to it.\" SAMUEL MOYN, THE LAST UTOPIA 7 (2010). Moyn bases this classification on the Helsinki Accords, President Carter's inauguration, and Amnesty International's Nobel Peace Prize, as well as: [T]he search for a European identity outside Cold War terms; the reception of Soviet and later East European dissidents by politicians, journalists, and intellectuals; and the American liberal shift in foreign policy in new, moralized terms, after the Vietnamese disaster. Equally significant, but more neglected, were the end of formal colonialism and the crisis of the postcolonial state[.] Id. at 8. Without the canonization of human rights through President Car ter and the d\u00e9tente project of the Helsinki Accords, Moyn argued that human rights would have likely remained in the peripheral backwaters of policy. See id. at 149 (\"[W]ithout Carter, the phrase itself might never have exploded so spectacularly: even afte r she placed her op -ed pieces that helped Amnesty International publicize suffering prisoners in 1974, Laber recalled, 'I did not use the words \"human rights\" to describe our cause; it was not part of my everyday vocabulary and would have meant little to m ost people at that time.'\").

Between the end of the Second World War and end of the Cold W ar, humanitarian interventions were not rationalized with human rights language and were instead justified by realpolitik .26 The emerging global human rights movement was not \"the cause but the consequence of the epochal ruptures of the late twentieth cent ury,\"27 including the disintegration of the Soviet Union and Miloevi's Yugoslavia. As the old international order collapsed and a new one emerged, human rights gained legitimacy as a response.28 The 1990s theoretical justification of human rights was dis tinct from previous eras. While earlier thinkers, such as Kant,29 traced cosmopolitanism to sovereign states and their interests, modern theorists eschewed the nation -state as \"the greatest impediment to a global cosmopolitan democracy.\"30 The rapid develo pment of international criminal law seeking to hold individuals \u2014not states \u2014accountable for human rights violations is exemplary of this pervasive normative shift in thought. This shift is also evident in the justifications given for military intervention. For example, the Gulf War of 1990 -91 was often justified as a defense of international law vis-\u00e0-vis Iraq's violation of Kuwait's sovereignty, while Saddam Hussein's genocidal abuses against the Kurds was not sufficiently addressed.31 However, the Kosovo W ar of 1998 -99 was explicitly justified as a humanitarian intervention.32 Following the intervention of NATO in Kosovo, J\u00fcrgen Habermas penned an article on the transformation of international law into a cosmopolitan law of global citizens and \"identified the dilemma of human rights politics as having to act as if a fully institutionalized global civic society already existed, even though their very promotion was the objective of the 24 Id. at 282. 25 Id. 26 Hoffmann argues that this realpolitik reasoning includes President Carter and Secretary Kissinger's adoption of human rights language at Helsinki and in United States foreign policy broadly. See id. at 285 (\"B etween the end of the Second World War and the early 1990s there was not a single humanitarian, political or military intervention that was justified through human rights.\"). 27 Id. at 282. 28 Id. at 290. 29 Id. at 285 (\"[H]uman rights were closely tied to the idea of sovereignty or, to put this more generally, to the political participation in a democratically constituted polity.\").

See generally IMMANUEL KANT, KANT'S PERPETUAL PEACE : A PHILOSOPHICAL PROPOSAL (Helen O'Brien trans., 1927) (positing six preliminary articles that attempt to reduce the likelihood of war) . 30 Hoffmann, supra note 7, at 290. 31 Of course, this was not the only justification for the involvement of the United States. Other economic interests, like oil, were also clearly at play. See, e.g. , Hoffmann , supra note 7, at 291 -92 (\"The United States l ed a multilateral coalition against Iraq, sanctioned by the United Nations after the sovereignty of one of its member states had been violated. This was the immediate justification given for the intervention, as well as clearly identified economic interest s (in particular, control over the stability of oil procurement. . . .\"); Paul W.

V\u00e1clav Havel invoked a similar argument: This war places human rights above the rights of the state . The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was attacked by the alliance without a direct mandate from the UN. This did not happen irresponsibly, as an act of aggression or out of disrespect for international law. It happened, on the contrary, out of respect for the law, for a law that ranks higher than the law which protects the sovereignty of states. The alliance has acted out of respect for human rights, as both conscience and international legal documents dictate .34 Thus, the human rights spoken of in the 1990 s are distinct through the valuation of individuals' moral rights over state sovereignty. A cocktail of factors were responsible for the swell of the human rights wave in the early 1990s: movements for Holocaust remembrance, the violent civil wars in Rwand a and Yugoslavia, the CNN effect, and the Habermasian favoring of individual human rights over state sovereignty.35 In both Rwanda and Srebrenica, the failure of United Nations peacekeeper intervention was an \"expression of the United Nations' political fa ilure and thereby the end of hopes placed in the organization to become more of a world government.\"36 This failure to prevent and end wars led to the \"belated embrace of the idea of human rights interventionism by the generation of baby boomers and studen t protesters.\"37 The connection of Srebrenica to Holocaust remembrance \u2014genocide to human rights \u2014was historically new.38 As humanitarian intervention entered a new era, so did international human rights law. The atrocities of Rwanda and Yugoslavia also sparked \"the emergence of a new international criminal law and its institutions, and possibly the most significant legal accomplishment in human rights of the two decades since Bosnia.\"39 Alongside the ad hoc tribunals, the Vienna Declarati on adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 \"constituted the resurgence of the debate about the universality of human rights.\"40 In contrast to the human rights conventions drafted between the 1960s and 1980s, which focused on decolonization , conventions throughout the 1990s distinctly centered on the criminal prosecution of \"past wrongs\"41 and anti -impunity measures.

Kathryn Sikkink identifies the move to prosecute perpetrators of human rights abuses as a development of the early 1990s, aligned with Hoffmann's thesis. Sikkink's \"justice cascade\" chara cterizes the \"shift in the legitimacy of the norm of individual criminal accountability for human rights violations and an increase in criminal prosecutions on behalf of that norm.\"42 Sikkink uses \"cascade\" to capture \"how the idea started as a small strea m, but later caught on suddenly, sweeping along many actors in its wake.\"43 Despite the increased number of human rights treaties, \"it began to appear that human rights violations were getting worse, not better.\"44 This was in part due to the failure to pr event human rights abuses and impunity provided to human rights violators, especially high -ranking government officials.45 Anti-impunity prosecutions developed to strengthen human rights law: \"Human rights prosecutions give teeth to the law because they ca n put formerly powerful people behind bars. If human rights law didn't work because it lacked strength, this new form of enforcement should help improve compliance.\"46 Sikkink found that before the mid -1980s, prosecutions were stagnant, but \"[b]y the early 1990s, the number of such events began a steep increase . . . the rapid diffusion of [the justice cascade] follow[ed] almost immediately after the end of the Cold War and with the fall of the Soviet Union,\"47 corroborating Hoffmann's argument. Anti-impun ity48 is valued by most human rights advocates; however, anti -impunity has not been met without criticism. Karen Engle expressed her concern with the human rights movement's rapid shift towards criminal law, arguing that \"the turn to criminal law was not an obvious trajectory for either the human rights movement or international law,\" and perhaps this embrace \"has taken place with little systemic deliberation about the aims of criminal law or about its pitfalls.\"49 The conflation of anti- impunity with human rights advocacy is ultimately harmful, as many view opposition to anti -impunity measures to also mean an opposition to human rights.50 The relationship between human rights and anti - impunity has \"helped shape the direction of human rights advocacy as well as both international human rights and international criminal law.\"51 Anti-impunity may also 42 KATHRYN SIKKINK , THE JUSTICE CASCADE : HOW HUMAN RIGHTS PROSECUTIONS ARE CHANGING WORLD POLITICS 5-6 (2011). 43 Id. 44 Id. at 20. 45 See id.

WOMEN 'S RIGHTS AS HUMAN RIGHTS : GENDER MAINSTREAMING IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE a. Gender at the United Nations Women's Caucuses are prime examples of a modern activist network. The t ransnational women's network53 began to coalesce during the drafting of the Declaration for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1967 and reached its peak during the 1990s at United Nations conferences. Networks are \"forms of org anization characterized by voluntary, reciprocal, and horizontal patterns of communication and exchange.\"54 Networks provide sources of reliable information for outsiders: \"they are organized to promote causes, principled ideas, and norms, and they often i nvoke individuals advocating [for] policy changes that cannot be easily linked to a rationalist understanding of their 'interests.'\"55 Communication between networks takes place in a \"dense web\" of formal and informal connections within the group.56 While advocacy networks date back to the nineteenth century, contemporary networks are radically different and more far -reaching than their historic counterparts due to technological advancements.57 Without the organizing of the transnational women's network at United Nations conferences, it is unlikely that the WCGJ would have been primed to form at Rome and exert strong influence over gender issues. The contemporary use of the word \"network\" originated with the women's movement in the United States coining the phrase \"old boys' network\"58 as a critique of sexism. \"Women's network\" was later coopted by women's groups, and entered into popular use around 1975, the year of the First Wor ld Conference on Women in Mexico City.59 Women's caucuses were initially limited in scope, but after twenty years, the transnational women's network wielded considerable influence at conferences.60 Violence against Women became 52 Id. at 1127. 53 Transnational women's networks in the context of this project refers to the sprawling group of women that organized at the United Nations Conferences (Part III), the ad hoc tribunals (Part IV), and at the Rome Conference (Part V). 54 KECK & SIKKINK , supra note 9, at 8. 55 Id. at 8-9. 56 Id. at 9. 57 Id. at 10, 14. 58 Id. at 167. 59 For example, the International Feminist Network, Latin American and Caribbean Feminist Network against Domestic and Sexual Violence, Asian Women's Research and Action Network.

These strategies developed by the women's network influenced the way the WCGJ advocated for the inclusion of SGBV provisions at the Rome Conference in 1998. The following subsection traces the development of the transnational women's network VAW ca mpaigns at United Nations conferences and the organizing strategies utilized by the transnational women's network to mainstream gender63 into the final documents of the conferences. b. The Transnational Women's Network at United Nations Conferences (1975 -1995) The influence of women's networks in transnational politics greatly expanded between the early 1970s and mid -1980s. After lobbying by the Women's International Democratic Federation and others, the Commission on the Status of Women recommended that the General Assembly declare 1975 International Women's Year. This resulted in the First World Conference on Women and the United Nations Decade for Women conferences in Copenhagen and Nairobi.64 Gender equality groups had a considerable impact on the agenda of both gender -centric conferences and other issue -based conferences. The Mexico City Conference65 was fundamental to the development of the international women's movement as the first United Nations conference dedicated solely to women. The participation o f NGOs was very limited, \"with only two representatives per accredited NGO permitted to participate on a limited basis. . . .\"66 Mexico City was fertile ground for activists 61 Prior to VAW's emergence in the 1980s, the women's movement focused primarily on discrimination. The original Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), drafted throughout the 1970s and adopted in 1979, does not make any reference to VAW. In the early 1980s, VAW was incorporated into social justice discussions and rose to the forefront of United Nations activity in 1985. 62 See KECK & SIKKINK supra note 9, at 166 (\"By the mid -1990s [VAW] had become the most important international women's issue. At the UN Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, violence against women was a 'centerpiece of the platform,' one of four issues given special prominence.\"). 63 See, e.g. , AMY BARROW , Women, Peace and Security: Mainstreaming Gender in Transitional Ju stice Processes , in WOMEN AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE : THE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN AS PARTICIPANTS 37 (Lisa Yarwood ed., 2012): Gender mainstreaming is the process of assessing the implications of legislation, policies or programmes on both men and women at all s tages of design, implementation and monitoring. In contrast with other gender equality initiatives such as equal treatment, the central purpose of gender mainstreaming is to achieve equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity. . . . 64 Elisabeth Jay Friedman, Gendering the Agenda: The Impact of the Transnational Women's Rights Movement at the UN Conferences of the 1990s , 26 WOMEN 'S STUD.

[b]ut it also did something that, while less tangible, may be in some ways more important than anything else: It established a network of concern .\"68 When Mexico City occurred, domestic violence was still too recent in discourse to become a central focus of the conference.69 The next year, \"two thousand women from forty countries spoke out on family violence, wife beating, rape, prostitution, femal e genital mutilation, murder of women, and persecution of lesbians\" at the First International Tribune on Crimes against Women.70 Keck and Sikkink trace the origins of the network to a series of meetings at the United Nations Women's Conference in Copenha gen. Charlotte Bunch, a feminist organizer at Copenhagen reflected: We observed in that two weeks of the forum that the workshops on issues related to violence against women were the most successful . . . they were the workshops where women did not divide along north -south lines, that women felt a sense of commonality and energy in the room . . . you get a chance to deal with difference, and see culture, and race, and class, but in a framework where there was a sense that women were subordinated and subject ed to this violence everywhere, and that nobody has the answers. So northern women couldn't dominate and say we know how to do this, because the northern women were saying: \"our country is a mess; we have a very violent society.\" So[,] it created a complet ely different ground for conversation. . . . It wasn't that we built the network in that moment. It was just the sense of that possibility.71 This newfound sense of possibility culminated in the first explicit mention of SGBV in an official United Nations document.

Following trends set by Mexico City and Copenhagen, Nairobi attracted a larger number of women.75 At the NGO forum, activists formed the International Network ag ainst Violence against Women, a network of communication, and the International Women's Rights Action Watch, a Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women watchdog group.76 By Nairobi, [A]dvances in gender -based critiques o f development theory and practice showed how women's oppression can only be understood contextually, by taking into account women and men's positions within specific countries, cultures, and economies. From a focus on identifying oppression (and fighting o ver its various forms), women moved to strategizing over ways to confront its various manifestations, whatever their original causes.77 Governments then adopted the Forward -Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women, which linked peace to the eliminat ion of VAW in the public and private spheres.78 Nairobi served as an important stepping stone for the emergence of networks in the transnational women's movement.79 Months after Nairobi, the General Assembly adopted the first resolution addressing domestic violence.80 The formidable presence of women at United Nations conferences was not limited to those under the purview of the Decade for Women. In 1992, the Conference on Environment and Development was held in Rio, where women's groups maintained a defi nitive presence.81 Activists employed new strategies to advocate for gender issues in the genderless Agenda 21. The Women's Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), founded 73 Id. at \u00b6 62. 74 In 1981, participants at the first Feminist Encounter for Latin America and Caribbean decide d to hold the \"Day against Violence against Women\" on November 25th in memory of three sisters that were murdered by the Trujillo dictatorship.

When faced with exclusion, women's groups \"creat[ed] their own opportunities for mobilization around the more general opportunity of the conference [and] advocates organized the largest -ever NGO preparatory conference for a UN meeting, with 1,500 participa nts.\"82 Women used \"tribunal[s] to offer public testimony about women's connection to environmental issues\" and an \"insider/outsider\" advocacy strategy, which \"simultaneously mobiliz[ed] advocacy networks to bring pressure from outside governmental arenas and coordinat[ed] lobbying inside them.\"83 In addition to strategical innovations, a Women's Caucus was established as a group to lobby for gender issues throughout the conference.84 Precedent setting was a key strategy of the Caucus: when lobbying delegat es to include women's rights in Agenda 21, \"the Caucus assembled 'precedent setting' information from previous UN documents\" that supported the Caucus' mission to demonstrate that their positions were \"built on accepted norms within the UN, not new rights. \"85 This strategy, according to Friedman, \"was a clear effort to mainstream the women's rights message while countering objections to it.\"86 These efforts were ultimately successful: while the draft Agenda 21 contained only two references to women, by the conclusion of Rio, the chapter, \"Global Action for Women Towards Sustainable and Equitable Development,\" was added with 172 references to wo men.87 Strategies for gender inclusivity, developed by activists, permeated conferences where VAW was the focus and depicts the effect that the transnational women's network can have on conference delegates. The next year, the World Conference on Human R ights was held in Vienna, and women made up half of the 3,000 NGO participants.88 Women's groups prepared meticulously for Vienna with national data generation, media contracts, and governmental lobbying through the coordination of NGOs.89 Keck and Sikkink cite this work as an example of \"a network's ability to draw attention to issues, set agendas, and influence the discursive positions of both states and international organizations.\"90 Leaders of the community \"worked closely with international advocates to insure [sic] the representativeness of the movement and its message[]\" in order to ensure the intersectionality of the transnational women's network.91 The Global Campaign for Women's Human Rights was created to unite ninety NGOs in making the international community focus on VAW in Vienna.92 82 Id. 83 Id. 84 Chen writes that the successes of gender mainstreaming can be attributed to the formation of Women's Caucuses, where \"[m]embers negotiated with official delegations to ensure that the draft document incorporated women's concerns throughout.\" Martha Alter Chen, Engendering World Conferences: The International Women's Movement and the United Nations , 16 THIRD WORLD Q. 477, 486 (1995).

The Women's Caucus coordinated lobbying efforts by uniting upwards of 200 participants and made six plenary presentations at the governmental conference to present the demands of gender equalit y advocates.96 The extraordinary engagement efforts by the CWGL had allowed them to have a direct impact on the language of the final document. The Women's Caucus used the insider/outsider strategy to ally with the United Nations Development Fund for Wom en (UNIFEM) through Roxanna Carillo, a former CWGL staff member and the head of UNIFEM's women's rights program. Cardillo and the CWGL frequently met during Vienna, ensuring contact between NGOs and delegates.97 Like in Rio, the CWGL designed the Tribunal on Violations of Women's Human Rights, which featured testimony by women from all regions of the world on the daily, widespread abuse of women's rights.98 The Tribunal was featured in Vienna's NGO forum, where women delivered \"personal testimony of devasta ting human rights abuses to a distinguished panel of judges. Hundreds of spectators observed the day -long Tribunal, and its conclusions were presented as part of the official record of the governmental conferences.\"99 However, the Tribunal also revealed th e difficulty in unifying the vast global abuses faced by women in one coherent \"frame.\"100 At the Tribunal, women suggested that their abuse was caused by a variety of factors: \"sexism, religious belief, and poverty \u2014and blamed a range of actors, from husban ds to state agents to the structure of global capitalism.\"101 Fierce debates broke out within NGO workshops over the role that legal remedies and the state should play in the women's rights movement and the protection of women.102 As a result of the transnat ional women's network's mainstreaming efforts, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action is rife with discussions of women's human rights.103 Vienna affirmed the progress 93 Id. 94 Id. 95 Id. 96 Id. 97 Id. 98 Id. 99 Id. 100 Id. 101 Id. 102 Id. 103 The language of Section 1, Paragraph 18 recalls the \"women's rights are human rights\" mantra and explicitly discussed sexual and gender -based violence: The human rights of women and of the girl -child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. ...

Women's rights advocates convened the following year at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. Similar to Rio and Vienna, activists were ab le to exert influence on the conference in a way that framed the agenda to include gender issues. Advocates linked controlling population growth to reproductive health access. Friedman argues that activists \"were responsible for the switch from a framing o f population issues as focused on controlling population growth to inextricably tied to the promotion of women's rights, both reproductive and other. . . .\"104 Gender justice NGOs quickly formed a Women's Caucus before government preparatory processes to ad d women's rights issues to the conference's agenda105 and ran many a number of visibility campaigns.106 At Cairo, NGOs were granted a larger level of involvement by the Secretary General. Not only were NGOs allowed to \"attend even informal consultations, bu t [the Secretary General] also gave them leave to intervene during closed door sessions . . . [and] incorporated their written statements in draft governmental documents.\"107 In addition to attending the conference separately, NGOs were often a part of gove rnmental delegations. For example, half of the United States' delegates were women's advocates including leading women's health advocates.108 This Women's Caucus was the largest yet with approximately 400 to 500 women attending their meetings.109 As a result , language was added to the final document that addressed the role of women in population growth.110 During conference trafficking, are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person, and must be eliminated.

In 1995, the Fourth World Conference on Women convene d and attracted an unprecedented 17,000 participants and 30,000 activists.112 Beijing highlighted the rapid growth of the international women's rights movement in the twenty years since Mexico City. Where discourse on domestic violence was too new to breach Mexico City's agenda, Beijing delegates found themselves in an intense debate over a wide range of subjects, including VAW. The continuous mainstreaming of gender at United Nations conference had an effect at Beijing: \"it was clear that the term 'gender m ainstreaming' had achieved great popularity. It appeared throughout the lengthy Platform for Action as a strategy to redress women's unequal position in twelve areas of concern. . . .\"113 However, the conference itself also experienced substantial disagreem ent amongst delegations in comparison to the first three World Conferences on Women. Martha Alter Chen, writing at the end of the final Preparatory Committee, noted that \"on the eve of the Fourth World Conference . . . there were signs of a well -organised and well -financed backlash\"114 against the promises made at Rio, Vienna, and Cairo. Chen traces these challenges back to the Preparatory Committees held prior to Beijing.115 NGOs faced accessibility restrictions and the drafting process itself was cumbersome and inefficient.116 After the final Preparatory Committee, thirty -five percent of the Draft Platform of Action was marked with square brackets, each marking a point that at least one state was unwilling to accept and indicated that further negotiations and amendments would o ccur in Beijing.117 The Draft Platform was also introduced late into the final Preparatory Committee, \"leaving little time for delegations to prepare positions\" on the text.118 Additionally, \"the preparatory process itself [was] sufficiently participatory th at minority voices [could] slow down, derail, or obstruct the process.\"119 This \"disagreement illustrated just how fragile the global consensus around women's human rights was going into the Beijing meeting.\"120 Although Beijing was anticipated to be the mo st contentious women's conference to date, the transnational women's network had also developed effective lobbying strategies and organized far beyond Mexico City. NGOs carefully monitored bracketed issues and fourth chapter of the report is entitled \"Gender Equality, Equity, and Empowerment of Women\" and VAW is explicitly discussed eight times.

At times, \"government delegations incorporated language suggested by NGOs directly; [at other times] governments consulted with NGOs to shape their positions on issues.\"121 The ultimate goal of Beijing was to \"protect[] the gains made against the newly po werful countermovement [and against their agenda], while trying to ensure some implementation for the new frames of the 1990s.\"122 This countermovement was a coalition of countries with strong Catholic and Islamic leadership that formed after the increased visibility of the women's network at Vienna and abortion issues at Cairo.123 At Beijing, WEDO coordinated a Linkage Caucus as an attempt to preserve the progress made by the network.124 The Linkage Caucus created three advocacy documents: \"recommendations on bracketed language; a chart of precedents from other UN documents and conferences legitimating specific NGO demands; and a Pledge for Gender Justice.\"125 Lobbying occurred informally at coffee breaks and in hallways due to limited NGO access to the governm ent working groups actually negotiating the bracketed language.126 Cultivated relationships between advocates and delegates were key to maintaining lines of communication, especially when access to the governmental conference was limited.127 The Platform fo r Action at Beijing was the most contested of all statements of the discussed international conferences.128 Similar to the Rome Conference, the two most disputed issues were the use of the word gender (as opposed to sex) and perceived \"threats\" to the famil y. Catholic states, led by the Holy See, \"objected to the feminist use of the word [gender], which distinguishes between biological sex and the roles, expectations, and actions of socialized men and women.\"129 The progressive use of gender, according to man y conservative delegations, opened the floodgates for alternate definitions of gender that operate outside of biologically essentialist norms.130 Twenty countries made reservations on parts of the Platform deemed to be incompatible with Islamic law, includi ng issues of reproductive justice, homosexuality, and inheritance.131 Catholic countries expressed similar reservations on parts of the Platform that challenged the \"traditional\" nuclear family, homosexuality, and abortion bans.132 Catholic and Islamic count ries again formed blocs on these issues, which persisted after the conclusion of Beijing at the Rome Conference. 121 Id. 122 Friedman, supra note 6 4, at 324. 123 Id. at 324. 124 Id. at 324 (\"WEDO coordinated a 'Linkage Caucus' to ensure that gains made by women at prior UN conferences would not be lost.\"). 125 Id. at 324. 126 Id. 127 Id. 128 SALLY BADEN & ANNE MARIE GOETZ , Who Needs [Sex] When You Can Have [Gender]?

With regard to the use of \"gender,\" Annex IV to the Platform for Action specified, \"the word 'gender' as used in the Platform for Action was intended to be interpreted and understood as it was in ordinary, generally accep ted usage.\"133 This vague statement replaced the disputed definition in the draft Platform but allowed for some level of interpretation beyond biological essentialism. The final Platform made notable advancements in the areas of sexual and reproductive heal th, anti- choice abortion laws, rape as a war crime, and the rights of girls.134 WEDO claims that in sum, sixty -seven percent of recommendations made by NGOs on the bracketed text were incorporated into the final Platform for Action.135 c. Conclusion In the span of twenty years, the transnational women's network managed to influence the United Nations far beyond the scope of the World Conferences on Women. In 1975, Mexico City documents made no explicit reference to VAW, but by Beijing in 1995, VAW was a centerpiece of the final document. Mainstreaming VAW would have simply been impossible without the organizing work by the transnational women's network. The success of the women's network in \"gendering the agenda\" at non -gender centric conferences was due to the development of mainstreaming strategies: specialized women's networks, extensive preparatory work, precedent setting, tribunals, and insider/outsider advocacy. By Beijing, these practices were decisively a part of the women's network repertoire. The advancement of mainstreaming strategies also emboldened the opposition to respond similarly, forcing the two groups into a framing contest. Understanding the development of the transnational women's network at United Nations conferences is pivotal to u nderstanding the role of the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice at the Rome Conference. 133 Rep. of the Fourth World Conference on Women, U.N.

SHIFTING PARADIGMS OF SEXUAL AND GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW This section delves into a thick description of the justice cascade and the development of international criminal law, culminating in an analysis of landmark cases that impacted how the International Criminal Court has prosecuted SGBV crimes. The formulation of ad hoc tribunals, riding the human rights wave of the 1990s, was a key contributing factor to the passage of the Rome Statute. The history of tribunal formation must be parsed out in order to understand both the WCGJ's incorporation of SGBV crimes and the establishment of the Court itself. The rapid development of international criminal tribunals in the 1990s is exemplary of Sikkink's justice cascade and Hoffmann's temporal postulation of the rise of human rights idealism, both necessary for the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice's existence. a. Rape and the Laws of War: From Cicero to Lincol n Attempts to regulate wartime behavior have been documented as early as 500 B.C.E.,136 but for much of history, SGBV has been sidelined due to the conception of women as property. Even further, rape was often considered a legitimate spoil of war.137 By the end of the Middle Ages, the normative legitimacy of wartime rape began to be reconsidered.138 In Hugo Grotius' De Jure Belli ac Pacis , one of the most substantial contributions to 136 KELLY DAWN ASKIN , CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN : PROSECUTION IN INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNALS 19 (1997) (discussing informal wartime regulations in Cicero's Marcus Tullius, Cicero's Three Books of Offices, or Moral Duties ). 137 SUSAN BROWNMILLER , AGAINST OUR WILL: MEN, WOMEN , AND RAPE 33 (1975). 138 Both Richard II (1385) and Henry V (1419) introduc ed bans on wartime rape.

Soldiers may not be given license to murder, rob, plunder, rape, or cons train civilians; those who do such things should be as severely punished as if the crimes had been committed during peacetime.\"). A century later, Alberico Gentili reiterated de Penna's sentiments: \"It is not lawful to do this wrong [rape], even if it is s ometimes lawful to kill women. . . . If a woman fights, why should she not allow war to be made upon her?. . . . But there is no reason why she should suffer so signal an insult [as rape].\" ASKIN , supra note 13 6, at 22. In fifteenth century England, Gerrar d Winstanley, founder of the radical Protestant group known as the Diggers, advocated for rapists to face capital punishment. GERRARD WINSTANLEY , THE WORKS OF GERRARD WINSTANLEY 599 (George H. Sabine ed., 1965) (\"If a man lie with a woman forcibly, and she cry out, and give no consent; if this be proved by two Witnesses or the mans confession, he shall be put to death and the woman let go free; it is robbery of a womans bodily Freedom.\"). Winstanley locates the equality of men and women in the ability of al l genders to reason, a radically progressive belief for his time. See GERRARD WINSTANLEY ET AL ., THE TRUE LEVELLERS STANDARD 6 (1939) (\"In the beginning of Time, the great Creator Reason, made the Earth to be a Common Treasury . . . And the Reason is this, Every single man, Male and Female, is a perfect Creature of himself; and the same Spirit that made the Globe, dwels in man to govern the Globe; so that the flesh of man being subject to Reason, his Maker, hath him to be his Teacher and Ruler within himsel f, therefore needs not run abroad after any Teacher and Ruler without him, for he needs not that any man should teach him, for the same Anoynting that ruled in the Son of man, teacheth him all things.\"). 383 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 international law, rape was condemned as an \"uncivilized act\" in civilized nations139 that \"[does not] contribute . . . consequentially [rape] [should] not go unpunished in war any more than in peace.\"140 While these statements by philosophers and jurists were certainly a step in the right direction, their words did very little to actually prevent wartime rape, and substantial legal advancements were not made until centuries later. The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries brought about small, though tangible, advancements in international law that addressed SGBV. In 1863, Columbia Professor Francis Lieber attempted to codify the customary law of war during the American Civil War.141 The Lieber Code, signed into law by President Lincoln, were specific instructions to regulate the conduct of Unio n soldiers. The Code explicitly referenced sexual violence in Article 44, which prohibits rape as a capital crime.142 The Lieber Code deeply impacted the international community's efforts to regulate warfare and was a precursor to the Hague Conventions of 1 899 and 1907. Article 46 of the Hague Convention of 1907 borrowed some of Article 44's language, but notably eliminated any explicit reference to rape or sexual violence. Instead, Article 46 states: \"Family honour and rights, the lives of all persons, and private property, as well as religious convictions and practice, must be respected.\"143 While Article 46 may be read to include SGBV through the family honor and rights language, the article has rarely been interpreted in this manner.144 The absorption of S GBV under family and honor rights that tends to emphasize moral notions of chastity and honor over the physical acts of violence and is still pervasive in contemporary international law.145 The Hague Conventions laid a 139 Of course, I must note that the concept of \"uncivi lized\" and \"civilized\" societies is a racist social construct that harkens back to colonialism and imperialism, whereby the domination and subjugation of non -Western societies was typically \"legitimated\" by characterizing the colonized as uncivilized and b arbaric.

The Post -War Landscape: The IMT, IMTFE, and Geneva Conventions The atrocities of the First and Second World Wars galvanized the first international crimina l tribunals dedicated to post -war justice. The Allied powers began to explore the possibility of prosecuting the Axis Powers in October of 1941.146 Nearly two years later, the United Nations War Crimes Commission was formed in London and shortly thereafter, the Allied Powers issued the Moscow Declaration, committing to \"united action, pledged for the prosecution of the war against their respective enemies, will be continued for the organization and maintenance of peace and security.\"147 On August 8, 1945, the International Military Tribunal (IMT) was created to prosecute prominent members of Nazi Germany. The IMT's jurisdiction extended to three crimes: crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Crimes against peace was defined by the Chart er as \"namely, planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing.\"148 Where crimes against peace relate to the waging of a war itself, both war crimes and crimes against humanity refer to the treatment of individuals. The Charter classifies war crimes as violations of customs or laws of war, and clearly lists out a number o f several actions that are considered war crimes.149 Similarly, the Charter defines crimes against humanity as a number of acts committed against a civilian population, without the condition of ongoing war.150 The Charter leaves room for the inclusion of \"ot her inhumane acts,\" but SGBV is absent from the listed crimes and the categories of persecuted groups. In comparison to the Lieber Codes, which preceded the IMT by over eighty years, the Charter did very little to incorporate SGBV crimes. Due to the influe nce of the Hague Conventions on the Charter, it is unsurprising that SGBV was overlooked at this point in history. SGBV crimes were absent in the Charter and prosecutions, despite ample evidence of these crimes in the concentration camps.151 Although the IM T never pursued SGBV charges, the ability to prosecute these crimes was granted by Control Council Law No. 10 (CCL No. 10). CCL No. 10 was established in 1945, 146 From Nuremberg to The Hague: Teaching from the Past - Challenges for the Future, NUREMBERG ACADEMY , http://www.nurembergacademy.org/fileadmin/media/pdf/From_Nuremberg_to_The_Hague.pdf (last visited Jan. 5, 2020). 147 Joint Four -Nation Declaration art.1, Moscow Conference, Oct. 1943. 148 Charter of the International Military Tribunal art. 6(a), Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Volume 1. 149 Id. at art. 6(b) (\"[M]urder, ill -treatment or deportation to slave labor or for any other purpose of ci vilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill -treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity.\"). 150 Id. at art. 6(c) (\"Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population . . . or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal[.]\"). 151 See NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMPS (National Archives and Records Administration 1945) (documenting concentration camps as they were found upon liberation). 385 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 prior to the Nuremberg trials, and empowered the authorities occupying Germany to continue prosecutions of war criminals. CCL No. 10 did not substantially deviate from the Nuremberg Charter, but crimes against humanity was updated to include rape.152 The formal inclusion of rape in crimes against humanity was a major milestone for the recognition of S GBV as a crime under IHL, regardless of how few perpetrators were prosecuted. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) was founded in 1946 as the IMT's Pacific Theater counterpart. Like the IMT, the IMTFE prosecuted three crimes: crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The IMTFE Charter did not include rape as a crime against peace or crime against humanity. The IMTFE's definition of war crimes departed from the IMT's extensive list and instead simply reads: \"namel y, the violations of the laws or customs of war.\"153 At the IMTFE, perpetrators were actually charged for SGBV crimes,154 but rape was deemphasized: survivors did not testify,155 some perpetrators charged with rape as a war crime were acquitted,156 and only a single paragraph was dedicated to the Rape of Nanking, in spite of the recognition that 20,000 rapes occurred during the first month of occupation.157 The Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols were adopted in the aftermath of the Second World War as an attempt to prevent future atrocities by codifying proscribed acts during war. The four Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1949, protects four classes of people: wounded and sick soldiers on land; wounded and sick soldiers at sea; prisoners of war; and civilians. Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions addressed for the first time \"situations of non -international armed conflict includ[ing] traditional civil wars, internal armed conflicts that spill over into other States or internal conflicts in which thi rd States or a multinational force intervenes alongside the government.\"158 Common Article 3 therefore allows SGBV to be prosecuted in internal conflicts, like the Rwandan Civil War. SGBV is not limited to international armed conflicts and manifests itself in all armed conflict. 152 \"Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape, or other inhumane acts committed against any civilia n population, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds whether or not in violation of the domestic laws of the country where perpetrated.\" Nuremberg Trials Final Report Appendix D, Control Council Law No. 10 (Dec. 20, 1945) (emphasis added ). 153 Special Proclamation: Establishment of an International Military Tribunal for the Far East, art. 5(b), Jan. 19, 1946, T.I.A.S.

Rape was subsumed under general charges of command responsibility for the atrocities committed in Nanking, and the conviction of General Iwane Matsui for war crimes and crimes against humanity was based in part on evidence of rape committed by his troops. The equally notorious forcing of thousands of 'comfort women' into pr ostitution in Japanese military brothels was, however, ignored by the IMTFE.\"). 158 The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols , INT'L COMM . RED -law/geneva -conventions/overview -geneva - LEAD TO ROME: A JURISPRUDENTIAL GENEALOGY OF FEMINISM, SEXUAL AND GENDER- BASED VIOLENCE, AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW 386 The Fourth Geneva Convention and Common Article 3 made progress in addressing SGBV. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 27 explicitly forbids some SGBV crimes: \"Women Shall be especially protected against any attack on thei r honour , in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault.\"159 The First and Second Additional Protocols also address SGBV, but with peculiar language. Article 76 of Protocol I is dedicated to the protection of women as \" object[s] of special respect.\"160 Likewise, Protocol II prohibits \"outrages upon personal dignity , in particular . . . rape, enforced prostitution, or any other form of indecent assault. . . .\"161 The language of the Geneva Convention provisions related to wo men relies heavily on notions of \"honor\" and \"dignity\" as opposed to the gravity of the violent crimes themselves. This linkage places an undue emphasis on the degradation of honor and distances the violent crime from the perpetrator, minimizes the physica l and psychological harms of the crime, and reinforces harmful stereotypes of women. Although some SGBV crimes are enumerated in the Geneva Conventions, they are not considered grave breaches subject to universal jurisdiction. The failure of the Geneva Con ventions to incorporate SGBV as a grave breach and the inappropriate focus on SGBV as chiefly a violation of honor in a foundational IHL document burdened future tribunals. c. The Second Wind: Ad Hoc Tribunals After the IMT and IMTFE concluded, there was a lull in international tribunals until the 1990s. Throughout the twentieth century, IHL largely disregarded the gravity of SGBV. This was to be expected as \"these laws were written by men drawing heavily on the male chivalric tradition and were interpreted by male military lawyers, judges, and governmental experts, in an age when rape was placed on the same footing as plundering, and was considered to be an inevitable consequence of war.\"162 This mentality began to shift with the advent of the International C riminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, which actively sought to prosecute SGBV perpetrators.163 The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicated that SGBV would be prosecuted since its inception in 1993.164 Secretary General Boutros Boutros -Ghali highlighted the \"widespread and systematic rape and other forms of sexual assault, including enforced prostitution\"165 in his report on the proposed tribunal.

Rape is explicitly enumerated as a crime against humanity in the ICTY Statute167 and reiterates the widespread nature of SGBV by expressing \"its grave alarm at continuing reports of widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law . . . including reports of . . . massive, organized, and systematic detention and rap e of women.\"168 The ICTR Statute emphasized the role of SGBV in armed conflict and built upon the avenues available for prosecuting these crimes. While the ICTY Statute solely listed rape as a crime against humanity, the ICTR Statute includes SGBV as war c rimes and crimes against humanity. Article 4 of the ICTR Statute includes \"rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault\"169 as outrages upon personal dignity. However, the ICTR Statute narrowly defines armed conflict in the context of crimes against humanity.170 By adopting this definition, the ICTR Statute inherently restricted the breadth of SGBV that could be prosecuted. In addition to the advancements made by the ICTY and ICTR Statutes, each tribunal heard groundbreaking cases that address ed SGBV. These cases aided in defining relationships between SGBV and crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, and torture. This section will discuss cases that contributed to the evolving connections between SGBV and international criminal law which , in turn, impacted the prosecution of these crimes at the International Criminal Court. The indictment in Prosecutor v. Dragan Nikoli initially did not address SGBV crimes. Nikoli was the Serbian Commander of the Suica detention camp, which housed as many as 8,000 Muslim detainees between May and October 1992.171 The decision against investigating SGBV at Suica was short -lived. When the trial started, \"evidence began to emerge that many of the women detained in the camp were subjected to sexual assault s, including rape.\"172 In response to this evidence, the three Trial Chamber judges stated: The Trial Chamber feels that the Prosecutor may be well -advised to review these statements carefully with a view to ascertaining whether to charge Dragan Nikoli wi th rape and other forms of sexual assault, either as a 166 Id. at art. 15(B)(88). 167 Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at 6 (Sept. 2009), https://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_sept09_en.pdf (compilation of original U.N. resolutions) 168 Id. at 17. 169 S.C.

While Nikoli was not charged with war crimes, he was convicted of \"[p]ersecutions on political, racial and religious grounds, murder, sexual violence ,[and] torture\"174 as crimes against humani ty. Prosecutor v. Anto Furundija was the third case completed by the ICTY and was another key case that included SGBV crimes. Furundija was a local Commander of the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) and faced charges of war crimes as a result of his involv ement in the torture, rape, and sexual assault of a woman during HVO interrogation. The sole charge in Furundija was rape as a war crime under Article 4(2)(e) of the Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions, which problematically includes rape as an outrage of personal dignity. In Furundija , and in other cases, women lawyers and judges played a pivotal role in prosecuting SGBV. In particular, Hildegard Uertz -Retzlaff and her all -women prosecuting team were instrumental in aggressively pursuing SGB V charges.175 The case was brought to the Appeals Chamber in 2000, which stated: With regard to the issue of the reaffirmation by the International Tribunal of rape as a war crime, the Appeals Chamber finds that the international community has long recogniz ed rape as a war crime. In the elebii judgment, one of the accused was convicted of torture by means of rape, as a violation of the laws or customs of war. This recognition by the international community of rape as a war crime is also reflected in the Rome Statute where it is designated as a war crime.176 Goldstone and Dehon argue that based on this statement, \"the Appeals Chamber does not consider the finding in Furundija to categorize rape as a subset of outrages against personal dignity.\"177 The Appeals Chamber insinuated that \"rape is now considered to be a self-standing war crime\"178 through the direct reference to Article 8(2)(b)(xxii) and Article 8(2)(e)(vi), where forms of SGBV are categorized as free -standing war crimes, independent of \"personal dig nity.\" This decision by the Appeals Chamber is crucial in the elevation of SGBV crimes as it signals a normative acceptance of SGBV as a free -standing war crime. 173 Prosecutor v.

Dragoljub Kunarac, et al. Kunarac was \"the first indictment in the history of international war crimes prosecutions with charges based solely on crime s of sexual violence against women.\"180 Over the course of the trial, the charges were repeatedly amended. Initially, the sixteen counts of rape were listed as crimes against humanity and, \"[i]n line with prosecutorial strategy at that stage, when rape was the basis for war crimes charges, it was subsumed under torture and outrages against personal dignity.\"181 The indictment was amended to add six counts of rape as a violation of the laws or customs of war in addition to the two existing personal dignity charges.182 The charges were again amended to include seven counts of rape as a war crime.183 Kunarac expanded the definition of rape to include all instances in which consent is not voluntarily given184 and held for the first time that sexual slavery is a crime against humanity.185 Again, these charges were the result of the efforts of Uertz -Retzlaff and o ther women, who \"sought to charge sexual violence under different criminal headings, including enslavement, to reflect the diverse nature of sexual violence. . . .\"186 The ICTY also made history in Prosecutor v. Zejnil Delali by prosecuting rape as a form of torture. In this case, the Office of the Prosecutor \"began to take imaginative steps to prosecute gender crimes as war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.\"187 Goldstone and Dehon argue that the most successful strategy in elevating SGBV crimes to grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions has been to use these crimes as evidence of actus reus for recognized grave breaches.188 Under this approach, SGBV is charged as a constituent crime to a recognized grave breach. An SGBV crime is dependent on the commission of an enumerated grave breach and thus limited to instances of SGBV that occurs concurrently with a grave breach. Instead, a new category inclusive of SGBV crimes as free -standing grave breaches should be created. Strategically charging S GBV as a constituent crime was piloted in Delali , where repeated incidents of rape were charged as torture. The Trial Chamber accepted this logic, ruling that \"the rape of any person [is] a despicable act which strikes at the very core of human dignity an d physical integrity.\"189 The Trial Chamber held that rape constituted a form of torture because the rapes were \"committed with an intent to discriminate against 179 See infra Part V.B. 180 Rosalind Dixon, Rape as a Crime in International Hu manitarian Law: Where to from Here? , 13 EUR. 697, 697 (2002). 181 Goldstone & Dehon, supra note 15 5, at 127. 182 Id. 183 Id. 184 Dixon, supra note 1 80, at 700. 185 Goldstone & Dehon, supra note 15 5, at 129. 186 MICHELLE JARVIS & NAJWA NABTI , Policies and Institutional Strategies for Successful Sexual Violence Prosecutions , in PROSECUTING CONFLICT -RELATED SEXUAL VIOLENCE AT THE ICTY 77 (Serge Brammertz & Michelle J. Jarvis eds., 2016). 187 Goldstone & Dehon, supra note 15 5, at 125. 188 Id. 189 Id. 2020 ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME: A JURISPRUDENTIAL GENEALOGY OF FEMINISM, SEXUAL AND GENDER- BASED VIOLENCE, AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW 390 'Muslims in general' and 'the victim in particular.'\"190 Goldstone and Dehon highlight the relationship between SGBV and torture: Rape specifically was not enumerated in the list of grave breaches, possibly because it was not considered to be a crime of violence of the type deserving of the greatest liability under the Conventions gender crimes recog nized as grave breaches are subject to universal jurisdiction. This development allows for gender crimes to be prosecuted by domestic courts, which could facilitate the domestic implementation of the substantive and procedural advances made by the Tribunal s in their analysis and prosecution of gender crimes.191 The recognition of rape as torture by the ICTY paved the way for SGBV crimes to be charged as a constituent element to a grave breach, thus elevating SGBV by association. This recognition is significa nt because \"it reverses the dismissive attitude toward crimes perpetuated mostly against women that resulted in none of the provisions specific to women in the Geneva Conventions being designated as 'grave breaches.'\"192 The roundabout manner of charging r ape as a constituent grave breach, while a major advancement, does not go far enough in elevating SGBV. SGBV should be enumerated as free-standing grave breaches, thereby including more forms of violence and subjecting perpetrators to universal jurisdictio n. Further, the fact that the torture in Delali took the form of rape suggests that the victim was also discriminated against based on her gender identity. Gender discrimination was explicitly dismissed when the ICTY \"held that complainants were 'taken ou t' to be raped 'on the basis only of their Muslim ethnicity,' and that the Muslim men and women in Foca were 'killed, raped or severely beaten' and the ' sole reason for this treatment was their Muslim ethnicity.'\"193 This ruling highlights the ongoing need for a more intersectional approach to SGBV. By \"oscillat[ing] between essentialisms of gender and race,\"194 the ICTY failed to encapsulate the complex identities of the victims, whose experiences were informed by race and gender. The ICTY chose to identify the \"Muslim civilian population\" as the general victims of these gendered attacks instead of recognizing that SGBV was committed against Muslim women because of their dual identities.195 190 Dixon, supra note 179, at 70 2. 191 Goldstone & Dehon, supra note 15 5, at 126. 192 Id. at 125 -26. 193 Dixon, supra note 1 80, at 701. 194 Id. Biological essentialism denies the unique interaction multiple, intersectional identities that individuals possess in fa vor of viewing identities as monolithic and discrete. Angela Harris articulates this in her critique of Catharine MacKinnon's \"gender essentialism\u2014the notion that a unitary, 'essential' women's experience can be isolated and described independently of race , class, sexual orientation, and other realities of experience.\" Angela P. Harris, Race and Essentialism in Feminist Legal Theory , 42 STAN. L. REV. 581, 585 (1990). Harris argued that when feminist legal theorists proffered a unified \"women's experience\" \" in the attempt to extract an essential female self and voice from the diversity of women's experience, the experience of women perceived as 'different' are ignored or treated as variations on the (white) norm.\" Id. at 615. 195 Dixon, supra note 1 80, at 701. 391 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 Prosecutor v. Jean -Paul Akayesu196 at the ICTR affirmed for the first time that SGBV crimes may constitute genocide. Like Nikoli , Akayesu did not initially include charges of SGBV crimes,197 which were only added when witness testimonies that indicated the pervasive presence of SGBV in the commune where Akayesu was the mayor and supported the commission of these crimes.198 Judge Navantham Pillay, the only woman judge at the ICTR at the time, advocated for the indictment to be amended to include SGBV charges.199 Like many of the prior SGBV cases, the ICTR relied on the outdated \"outrages upon personal dignity\" language, but a lso recognized that \"rape committed with the aid of a public official is torture.\"200 This decision was monumental because any form of SGBV had yet to be held as constituting genocide.201 For the first time in history, an international war crimes tribunal su ccessfully convicted a defendant guilty of genocide where SGBV was a critical component of the genocide charge.202 Askin outlines just how monumental the Akayesu decision was for the prosecution of SGBV: (1) the trial chamber recognized sexual violence as an integral part of the genocide in Rwanda, and found the accused guilty of genocide for crimes that included sexual violence; (2) the chamber recognized rape and other forms of sexual violence as independent crimes constituting crimes against humanity; and (3) the chamber enunciated a broad, progressive international definition of both rape and sexual violence.203 The international criminal tribunals made significant progress in bringing substantial prosecutions of SGBV crimes to the fore. Patri cia Viseur Sellers reflects, \"[t]he ad hoc [t]ribunals by trying and convicting perpetrators [of SGBV crimes] fomented a legal climate beyond [its] jurisdiction that [made it conducive to draft] several sex -based crimes [into] the Rome Statute of the ICC.\"204 As the ICTY and ICTR were unfolding, momentum for a permanent international criminal court grew, and the drafting process for the Rome Statute ran concurrently to some prosecutions at both tribunals.205 Due to the involvement of WCGJ members in the ad hoc tribunals, many of the arguments used at Rome reflect the ad hoc 196 Prosecutor v. Akayesu, Case No. ICTR -96-4-T, Judgment (Int'l Crim. Trib. Sept. 2, 1998). 197 Goldstone & Dehon, supra note 15 5, at 124. 198 Id. 199 Id. 200 Diane Marie Amann, Prosecutor v. Akayesu.

For example, the WCGJ borrowed lines from elebii when advocating for the admission of rape in the Rome Statute's list of grave breaches.206 The WCGJ's ability to take hold of the anti -impunity momentum that spurred the creation of the ad hoc tribunals was necessary to their overall success at Rome. As a result, the Court was influenced by the advances \u2014and downfalls \u2014of the tribunals and, in turn, some ad hoc tribun al cases were influenced by the Rome Statute's more progressive SGBV provisions. The timing of the justice cascade and the preeminence of the transnational women's network by the United Nations conferences of the 1990s was not a coincidence. Both events we re the result of the \"epochal ruptures of the late twentieth century\"207 and, without these events, it is unlikely that the WCGJ would have been able to impact the Rome Statute's language on SGBV so deeply. IV. FROM PERIPHERAL BACKWATERS TO THE FORE: FEMINIST ACTIVISM IN ROME This Part is a critical examination of the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice's role in the foundation of the International Criminal Court. The WCGJ was founded as a direct outgrowth of the transnational women's network after its successes at United Nations conferences. This piece of the story was the fortuitous confluence of three events brought about by the human rights wave: gender mainstreaming, the justice cascade, and the creation of the International Criminal Court. Like the Parts bef ore, it is essential to tell the story of becoming, that is, engage deeply with the temporally and legally complex events that aided in the establishment of the Court through thick description. The issues that the WCGJ fought for at negotiations were wide -sweeping, and for the sake of brevity, this Part will focus on language modifications that sought to fundamentally alter how the law conceptualizes SGBV.208 a. Establishing an International Criminal Court: A Short History The concept of an international crimi nal court was far from new by the time that Trinidad and Tobago proposed its creation to the United Nations General Assembly in 1989, with direct efforts in recent history spanning as early as 1899 with the First Hague Convention for the Settlement of Inte rnational Disputes.209 Almost a hundred years after the First Hague 206 See id. at 12, 67 (noting the strategy of referencing ICTY and ICTR decisions when negotiating the Rome Statute). 207 Hoffmann, supra note 7, at 282. 208 The Women's Caucus for Gender Justice also impacted procedural issues involving gender, but those issues are not the subject of this project. See, e.g. , Halley, supra note 1 1, at 36, 107 -08 (surveying various procedural initiatives undertaken by the WCGJ); Goldstone & Dehon, supra note 15 5, at 136 -37 (discussing WCGJ's gender mainstreaming efforts on the Rules and P rocedures of Evidence of the ICC). 209 In 1907, the Second Hague Convention dealt with obligatory arbitration and received support from major world powers, including the United States, Great Britain, and Russia. During the interwar period, the League of Nations sought to establish the Permanent Court of International Justice with proposals from Allied powers \"containing various international rules of individual culpability for human rights abuses and aggression.\" STEVEN C. ROACH , POLITICIZING THE INTERNATIONA L CRIMINAL COURT : THE CONVERGENCE OF POLITICS , ETHICS , AND LAW 21 (2006). 393 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 Convention, the International Law Commission produced a draft statute for the International Criminal Court.210 Throughout 1995 and 1997, preparatory committees met six times to write the dra ft statute, and in June of 1998, 168 state delegations and several delegates from international organizations met in Rome to negotiate the document.211 When the conference began, the draft statute was riddled with over 1,700 square brackets, each marking points of disagreement between states.212 During the conference, progressive states formed the Like -Minded Group (LMG), \"an ad hoc group of states [that ] work[ed] on the draft and advance[d] the idea of a permanent court.\"213 The Like -Minded Group was largely comprised of \"middle powers that were not directly involved in any conflicts, and had relatively little historical baggage to compromise the credibil ity of their search for humanitarian solutions.\"214 The LMG conceived of themselves as depoliticized in an important sense: they lacked strong political interests and strategic entanglements in many parts of the world. Because they were not global powers, t hey thought of themselves as more able to construct international architecture that would be perceived as fair and legitimate by the rest of the world . . . [and] powerful states with complex interests had limited ability to advance impartial international justice.215 The Permanent Five (P5), however, remained wary of the statute and sought to preserve their Security Council privileges.216 In response, the P5 suggested that the Security Council should control the new court as an effort to insulate their citiz ens from criminal accountability and were met with great resistance.217 William Pace, the leader of the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, warned that \"some countries . . . want the court to be controlled by the Security Council, reducing the I CC to a sham status of a 'permanent' ad hoc tribunal; one which would dispense international criminal justice only to the small and weak countries, never to violators in powerful nations.\"218 In the summer of 1997, Singaporean diplomats offered an important compromise between P5 nations and the LMG: The Council could possess limited powers over the Court, and if the Council agrees that a particular inquiry would be counterproductive, they could halt investigation for a certain period of time.219 The Security Council could refer cases to the Court, but P5 210 Id. at 33. 211 Id. at 32 -33. 212 ANNA-KARIN LINDBLOM , NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 463 (2005) (\"[T]he draft Statute which was before the conference was far from a finalised text, containing around 1,700 square brackets representing points of disagreement and different alternatives for the wording of previsions.\"). 213 DAVID BOSCO , ROUGH JUSTICE : THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT IN A WORLD OF POWER POLITICS 38-39 (20 14). 214 Philippe Kirsch & John T.

Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch recalled: There was at least an implicit recognition that a number of heavyweig hts were going to remain outside the court and that the imperative was to push the negotiation across the finish line . . . and even with the disadvantage of several heavyweights on the outside, rely on the momentum that the like - minded group would provide , rely on that quantitative mass and the sense of momentum, to pull along those heavyweights who were not so favorably disposed.224 On July 17, 1998, the Rome Statute was adopted in a vote of 120 -7 with 21 abstentions.225 The final version of the Rome Statut e reflected the compromises, \"requiring the ICC to obtain Security Council permission to proceed and precluding the Security Council from any ability to stop investigations.\"226 This allows the Security Council to perform its Chapter VII duties while preven ting the P5 from unilaterally abusing their veto power to halt investigations.227 Almost fifty years after the International Military Tribunals, \"the most powerful states were losing their grip on the mechanisms of international justice.\"228 b.

Throughout the preparatory committees, the CICC found allies in the LMG and, at the third meeting of PrepCom1, NGOs were permitted to register for all informal an d formal meetings.230 By the Rome conference, the United Nations allowed the participation of NGOs, and NGO input became valued as expert information as opposed to lobbying. The reputation that NGOs earned as reliable and knowledgeable sources of informatio n, prepared to engage in a professional way about the subject matter of ICC issues, greatly contributed to the receptiveness of states to their positions and assisted the good working relationships that evolved between many NGOs and state delegations.231 The 316 NGO members of the CICC split into four working groups, including one on gender issues: the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice.232 The Women's Caucus for Gender Justice was a direct outgrowth of the transnational women's network solidified at UN confe rences. At Rome, the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice emerged as the leading feminist group credited for incorporating a \"stronger gender perspective throughout . . . [the reform.234 The WCGJ was an offici ally recognized coalition of over 300 NGOs, human rights activists, and lawyers that lobbied for feminist issues, including the expansion of language surrounding SGBV.235 Many of the activists on the WCGJ were legal scholars that actively documented their w ork in law review articles, providing a unique window into the movement's modus operandi .236 Bedont and Hall -Martinez credit the success to their \"persistent lobbying efforts,\"237 and that \"[w]omen's rights activists viewed the negotiations for the IC C as a historic opportunity to address the failures of earlier international treaties and tribunals to properly delineate, investigate, and prosecute wartime violence against women.\"238 Within 229 Fanny Benedetti & John L.

Defining Gender and Gender Violence The WCGJ started at the proverbial drawing board for their first major language negotiation: defining \"gender\" and \"gender violence.\" Bedont and Hall -Marti nez stated their rationale for the use of \"gender\" over \"sex\" in the Rome Statute: The Women's Caucus pushed for the term \"gender\" as opposed to \"sex\" because the latter is restricted to the biological differences between men and women, whereas gender includes differences between men and women because of their socially constructed roles. Similarly, \"gender crimes\" is preferable to \"sexual violence\" because it includes crimes which are targeted at men or women because of their gender roles which m ay not have a sexual element.240 \"Gender violence\" subsumes \"sexual violence,\" as \"sexual violence\" cannot encompass the expansive forms of violence that people face as a result of social constructs surrounding gender.241 The inclusion of \"gender violence\" i nto the Rome Statute also addresses actions that affect men and LGBTQ+ people. For example, men face gender -based persecution \"when young boys are either killed to prevent their becoming soldiers or coerced and humiliated into becoming killers.\"242 The United Nations has generally experienced great difficulty in negotiating mutually agreed upon definitions of gender,243 and the Rome conference was not an exception. The strife associated with negotiating gender issues is not unique to the Rome Statute . For example, in Elisabeth Friedman's survey of gender mainstreaming at United Nations conferences, she found that an alliance is often formed between states with strong religious leadership.244 These states tend to rally against language \"that could be se en as promoting 239 \"[T]hey wanted authoritative enumeration of sexual crimes in their own ter ms. They wanted to establish that rape, sexual violence, and sexual slavery are IHL/ICL crimes. They wanted these sexual crimes to be lodged as high up in the hierarchy of IHL/ICL codification as they could get them, and in terms that derive from their sha red feminist understanding of them.\" Halley, supra note 1 1, at 49 -50. 240 Bedont & Hall -Martinez, supra note 23 7, at 68. 241 Halley, supra note 1 1, at 82. An example of gender violence could include the \"impress[ion of women] into maternity a form of gender e nslavement. The same is true when women are impressed into providing domestic services whether on a large scale or individualized basis (forced temporary marriage)[.]\" Id. at 84. 242 Id. at 84. 243 See supra Part III. 244 See Friedman, supra note 64 , at 323 (\"Led by the Vatican, a coalition of countries and conservative NGOs engaged the transnational women's rights movement in a framing contest on women's rights. While claiming to 397 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 legal abortion or harming the traditional family structure.\"245 The WCGJ and more progressive states struggled against those that wished to further a more traditional understanding of \"gender\" (defining \"gender\" in a manner that would equate it to \"sex\"). As a result, a \"peculiar and circular\"246 definition of \"gender\" was drafted: \"For the purposes of this Statute, it is understood that the term 'gender' refers to the two sexes, male and female, within the context of society .\"247 The resulting quixotic article both emphasizes a biologically essentialist conception of \"gender\" and infers that this biologically essentialist conception of gender can be analyzed through social constructs. Oosterveld asserts that the United Nations has avoided defin ing gender due to the lack of consensus over the meaning of gender,248 and Article 7(3) demonstrates that gender \"is undertheorized in international law.\"249 The WCGJ's structural feminist250 definition of gender was unpopular, especially with conservative st ates. As a result, other WCGJ agenda items were at risk: \"The dispute regarding terminology [of gender] threatened the inclusion of certain gender crimes, of a non-discrimination clause, and of special protective measures under the procedural provisions.\"251 ii. Honor, Dignity, and the Geneva Conventions The pervasive language surrounding SGBV as a crime against the \"honor\" and \"dignity\" of a woman was another target for the WCGJ, who sought to elevate these crimes to a grave breach. The CUNY Clinic Memorandum252 outlined a feminist project for a new court, which argued for the inclusion of SGBV crimes as a grave breach253 vis-\u00e0-vis torture, as seen in Delali : promote an agenda that also supported gender equality, this coalition specifica lly attacked those rights that threatened the hegemony of a 'traditional' conception of gender relations.\"). 245 Id. 246 Rhonda Copelon, Gender Crimes as War Crimes: Integrating Crimes Against Women into International Criminal Law , 46 MCGILL L.

For example, the WCGJ offered a distinctly structural interpretation of the Tadi case: \"[A] man was tortured when another prisoner was forced to bite off his testicle. The sexual organs of the man were targeted in order to take away his male identity and to make him like a woman.\" Id. at 86. 251 Bedont & Hall -Martinez, supra note 23 7, at 68. 252 Jennifer Green et al., Affecting the Rules for the Prosecutio n of Rape and Other Gender -Based Violence Before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia: A Feminist Proposal and Critique , 5 HASTINGS WOMEN 'S L.J. 171 (1994). 253 See id. at 237 (\"Every act of rape in war \u2014whether a consequence of indi scipline, retaliation, or genocidal policies \u2014is a 'grave breach,' a principle that has been recently reaffirmed by international scholars at the International Committee of the Red Cross.\"). 2020 ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME: A JURISPRUDENTIAL GENEALOGY OF FEMINISM, SEXUAL AND GENDER- BASED VIOLENCE, AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW 398 Within the framework of \"grave breaches\" against the civilian population recognized by the Fourth Geneva Convention, rape, forced prostitution and forced pregnancy are not simply crimes against \"honor,\" but also crimes of violence. They constitute forms of \"willful torture and inhumane treatment\" and they \"willfully caus[e] great suffering or serious injury to body or health.\"254 Further, SGBV should also be charged as a grave breach in order to individualize the crime as opposed to a crime against humanity, which implies that the crime was predominantly a harm suffered by society.255 Categorizing SGBV as an honor crime divorces the physical and psychological violence inflicted on victims and reorients the focus to an abstract conception of honor. This approach deemphasizes the actual violence of the crimes and distances the perpetrator from the crime: \"[t]he outdated and potentially harmful message that these violent, physical crimes were to be evaluated based on the harm done to the victims' honour, modesty, or chastity\"256 is detrimental to a true rebuke of SGBV. The WCGJ sought to send the \"radical\" message that sexual violence is violence : SGBV \"is a sexual assault ; it is violent and physical ; it causes physical and emotional (or physical and psychological) harm ; it is painful .\"257 Whereas the current IHL lexicon \"assume[d] that women should be protected from sexual crimes because t hey implicate a woman's honor, reinforcing the notion of women as men's property rather than because they constitute violence.\"258 The WCGJ was only partially successful in their endeavor. The Rome Statute incorporated \"outrages upon personal dignity,\" but removed both SGBV and \"honor\" from the provision. Article 8(2)(b)(xxi) is dedicated to personal dignity violations as a war crime, but does not explicitly mention any act of SGBV.259 Article 8(2)(b)(xxii) is devoted entirely to SGBV: \"rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy ... enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence also constituting a grave breach\" may be prosecuted by the Court.260 This development, while certainly not ideal for the WCGJ, \"[t]his characterization o f sexual violence is . . . important to the ICC's capacity to indict sexual violence crimes in multiple ways.\"261 For the first time, SGBV crimes were delinked from antiquated notions of morality. 254 Id. 255 HILLARY CHARLESWORTH & CHRISTINE CHINKIN , THE BOUNDARIES O F INTERNATIONAL LAW: A FEMINIST ANALYSIS 315-21 (2000). 256 Valerie Oosterveld, Sexual Slavery and the International Criminal Court: Advancing International Law , 25 MICH.

(En)forced Pregnancy The idea to introduce forced pregnancy as a SGBV crime likely originated from feminist activists.262 The WCGJ's recommendation to include forced pregnancy as a crime launched the WCGJ into conflict with the Holy See who \"sought to delete enforced pregnancy from the draft statute on the ground that it threatened to criminalize enforcement of national laws discouraging or criminalizing abortion.\"263 To quell tension in order for forced pregnancy to move forward, the WCGJ sought to limit the scope of the crime.264 First, the WCGJ specified that \"forced pregnancy\" is \"a violent crime, committed with a violent i ntent.\"265 Second, the WCGJ narrowed its scope: \"rape or other sexual abuse carried out with the intent or having the effect of making a woman pregnant and/or confining, controlling, or coercing a pregnant woman because she is pregnant.\"266 The final definit ion reads: \"the unlawful confinement of a woman forcibly made pregnant, with the intent of affecting the ethnic composition of any population or carrying out other grave violations of international law. This definition shall not in any way be interpreted a s affecting national laws relating to pregnancy.\"267 While this is weaker than the original proposal by the WCGJ, as it focuses solely on confinement (spatial -based) and excludes coercion and control (power -based), the language still represents a step forwa rd in recognizing forced pregnancy as a crime against humanity. iv. Enforced Prostitution and Sexual Slavery: The Consent Schism Reforms involving enforced prostitution and sexual slavery, unlike previous objectives, illuminate the ideological rift between str ucturalist and liberal feminists. Structuralist feminists tended to support the view that all sex work, regardless of consent, constitutes sexual slavery and often conflate enforced prostitution, trafficking, and sexual slavery, denying the agency of sex w orkers to consent to commercial sex.268 On the other hand, liberal 262 Halley, supra note 1 1, at 8 8. 263 Id. at 89. 264 Id. 265 Id. 266 Id. 267 Rome Statute, supra note 1 5, at art. 7(2)(f). 268 See Halley, supra note 1 1, at 90 -91 (\"[B]y structuralist I mean that a commitment to the view that the subordination of women is coextensive with male/female relations is their structure . In a fully structuralist feminist view of sexuality, no sexual interaction between a man and a woman is free from the effects of male domination.\"). The conflation of sex trafficking with slavery dates back to the moral campaigns of the nineteenth century. Similar claims were made by second wave feminists, who often improperly forged links between chattel slavery and sex work. See, e.g. , Janet Halley et al., From the International to the Local in Feminist Legal Responses to Rape, Prostitution/Sex Work, and Sex Trafficking: Four Studies in Contemporary Governanc e Feminism , 29 HARV. J.L. & GENDER 335, 338 -39 n. 7 (2006) (summarizing different ideological approaches to sex work); TERESA BILLINGTON -GREIG, THE TRUTH ABOUT WHITE SLAVERY 429, 443 (1913) (disputing the historical existence of white slavery as \"an epidemic of terrible rumours ... a campaign of sedulously cultivated sexual hysterics.\"); CAROLE PATEMAN , THE SEXUAL CONTRACT 203-04 (1988) (comparing sex work to slavery); KATHLEEN BARRY , FEMALE SEXUAL SLAVERY 40 (1979) (\"Female sexual slavery is present in ALL s ituations where women or girls cannot change the immediate conditions of their existence; where regardless of how they got into those conditions they cannot get out; and where they are subject to sexual violence and exploitation.\"); Catherine A. MacKinnon, Prostitution and Civil Rights , 1 MICH. J. GENDER & L. 13, 22 (1993) (arguing for the application of the Thirteenth Amendment to sex work). 2020 ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME: A JURISPRUDENTIAL GENEALOGY OF FEMINISM, SEXUAL AND GENDER- BASED VIOLENCE, AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW 400 feminists differentiated between consensual sex work and enforced prostitution.269 The schism between the two ideologies is evident in Oosterveld's270 \"Sexual Slavery and the International Cri minal Court,\" which documents the effort by structural feminists to retire \"enforced prostitution\" in favor of \"sexual slavery\": some felt \"that sexual slavery is a broader, more sensitive \u2014and therefore more useful \u2014term that encompasses or replaces enforce d prostitution,\"271 whereas \"[o]thers argue that both sexual slavery and enforced prostitution are different terms with different elements, and that enforced prostitution should not be considered to be subsumed within sexual slavery.\"272 Because the WCGJ was composed of both structuralist and liberal feminists, the group was often prevented from endorsing language due to a lack of consensus on terminology.273 In this instance, the 269 See Halley, supra note 1 1, at 92 (\"There is a sharp divide between feminists who see 'sexual slavery' and those wh o see 'bargained -for exchange' when a woman accepts money or some other benefit in exchange for having sex . . . [the latter] seek reforms that limit criminalization of the pimp's and John's activities to instances in which the woman is coerced, and leave open the category of 'nonforced prostitution.'\"). Thomas described the structuralist approach to consensual sex work as follows: Structuralists called for a definition that included all commercial sex automatically within the ambit of sex trafficking \u2014an ex plicit finding of coercion would not be necessary since, according to the structuralist approach, all commercial sex was necessarily coercive. The structuralist proposal also called for an explicit statement disregarding any manifestation of apparent conse nt by the trafficking victim. Just as one cannot legally consent to one's own enslavement, consent could not be a basis for validating commercial sex since it was \"female sexual slavery.\" Halley et al., supra note 26 8, at 98. 270 Who, according to Halley, w as \"one of the Rome process's liberal feminists,\" but \"she supported structuralist reforms in structuralist terms. She argued for a shift to autonomy that would strengthen the liberal feminist variant.\" Halley, supra note 1 1, at 100. 271 Oosterveld, supra note 25 6, at 618 (2004) (summarizing the liberal feminist approach to sexual slavery and enforced prostitution). For example, Askin argued that \"while '(en)forced prostitution' is usually the term used when women are forced into sexual servitude during warti me, the term 'sexual slavery' more accurately identifies the prohibited conduct[.]\" KELLY D. ASKIN , Women and International Humanitarian Law , in 1 WOMEN AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW 41, 48 n. 29 (Kelly D. Askin & Dorean M. Koenig eds., 1999). 272 Ooste rveld, supra note 25 6, at 618 . 273 The December 1997 Recommendations used language to describe trafficking without explicitly using the word: \"enslavement and slavery -like practices in all their forms, including by sale, deception, coercion, or threat.\" Halley, supra note 11 , at 93. At the March 1998 Preparatory Committee, the WCGJ actively opposed using the term trafficking \"[b]ecause of the need for review of the international definition of trafficking, the Women's Caucus suggest[ed] instead that the crime be described as ' trade in and coercive or deceptive transportation of persons.'\" Id. The ideological struggle between liberal and structural feminists is painfully evident in the December 1997 Recommendations, which attempted to incorporate both ideologies without adequate ly mediating between the diametrically opposed positions on sex work: [S]exual enslavement has been diminished by calling it only \"enforced prostitution.\" The term \"enforced prostitution\" muffles the degree of violence, coercion and control that is characteristic of sexual slavery . It suggests that sexual services are provided as part of an exchange albeit one coerced by the circumstances. When, as in the Ge neva Conventions, forced prostitution is equated within the \"performance\" of degrading acts, the term also suggests that sexual services are offered rather than brutally exacted. It hides the fact that this is rape , serial rape, physically invasive and psy chologically debilitating in the extreme, and 401 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 resulting language used a blend of structural and liberal approaches to enforced prostitution and sexual slavery, highlighting the tension between the two in the Caucus.274 But, curiously, these ideological disagreements were more muted than those on trafficking, where disagreements within the WCGJ were very public.275 Ultimately, the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice adopted a more structural approach to the debate, arguing that enforced prostitution and sexual slavery have, in the past, been conflated and that the same should not be codified in the Rome Statute.276 Articles 7 and 8 include both sexual slavery and enforced prostitution as enumerated crimes against humanity and war crimes. Structural feminists experienced some defeats with regard to sexual slavery: the phrase \"trafficking in persons, in particular women a nd children\" was employed to define \"enslavement\" under Article 7(2)(c), which the WCGJ actually actively opposed throughout the drafting process.277 Similarly, enforced prostitution is still featured in both Article 7 and 8 alongside sexual slavery, despit e structuralist WCGJ efforts to retire the phrase. However, the inclusion of sexual slavery alongside enforced prostitution was a net gain for the WCGJ.278 that women are reduced to and sexually bludgeoned as property , and that they are completely under the control of the perpetrator . History has taught us that most so-called \"forced prostitution\" during armed c onflict constitutes sexual slavery. Id. at 95. Halley writes: \"In denouncing enforced prostitution as sexual slavery, identifying it with rape, and insisting that women participate in it 'completely under the control' of male attackers, the WCGJ merges enf orced prostitution into rape and sexual slavery.\" Id. But, however, the recommendations \"proceed to a conclusion that most forced prostitution is sexual slavery [and] open up the possibility that some acts of forced prostitution are not enslaving or the eq uivalent of rape.\" Id. This contradictory statement attempts to advance both liberal and structural positions without meaningfully remediating ideological conflict. 274 Halley notes this is evident in a WCGJ report, Gender Justice and the ICC : The Causus' [s ic] structure has been fundamental to creating a document that reflects the consensus of participants in the Women's Caucus who have attended the Preparatory Committee meetings, and many others, throughout the world, who participated in inspiriing [sic], d eveloping, vetting or subscribing to the recommendations. This means that on particular points, some individuals or groups may differ with the Caucus's position but, on the whole, the Core Principles which form part of these recommendations, are supported by thousands of men and women around the world . . . . Id. at 97 n. 351. 275 In the enforced pregnancy versus sexual slavery debate, documents like Gender Justice and the ICC alluded at disagreement within the Caucus but, according to Halley, \"[w]hat is so striking is how muted these disagreements were. In the context of trafficking, opposed camps exist and are willing to go public with their disagreements.\" Id. at 97. 276 See Oosterveld, supra note 25 6, at 620 -22 (outlining the arguments made by the WCGJ favo ring the use of \"sexual slavery\" over \"enforced prostitution). 277 See Halley, supra note 1 1, at 93 (\"[T]he WCGJ at first advocated alternative language and then actually opposed the inclusion of trafficking in the statute.\"). 278 \"[Sexual slavery] can be char ged as a war crime in international and internal conflicts as a crime against humanity. It remains to be seen how feminists inside the ICC and those putting pressure on it from the outside will manage the structuralist/[liberal] tension in the WCGJ's inter pretations of this crime.\" Id. at 108. 2020 ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME: A JURISPRUDENTIAL GENEALOGY OF FEMINISM, SEXUAL AND GENDER- BASED VIOLENCE, AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW 402 v. Application and Conclusion The negotiations over SGBV terminology undertaken by the WCGJ were key to shifting the normative perception of gender at the Court. One method of recognizing gender justice is through the enumeration of crimes279 with language affirming the gravity of SGBV. Recognizing gender inequities involves \"changing the gender status order, deinstitutionalizing sexist value patterns and replacing them with patterns that express equal respect for women.\"280 The WCGJ sought to dismantle heteropatriarchal institutions by redefining war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in a manner th at dispels of archaic conceptions of gender, while elevating SGBV in the criminal hierarchy. Prior to the involvement of feminist activists in international criminal tribunals, the \"existing formal codes either ignored the sexual and gender dimensions of i nternational crimes altogether or diminished their seriousness by categorizing them as acts related to 'honour and dignity' rather than grave breaches of international law[.]\"281 The WCGJ was partially successful in language -shifting: SGBV may be prosecuted as standalone crimes; honor and dignity language has been divorced from SGBV; and SGBV crimes have been enumerated as an act of war crimes,282 crimes against humanity,283 and genocide.284 In practice, adherence to the formal rules of the International Crimi nal Court with regard to SGBV has been far from perfect. During its first decade, the Court went without prosecuting any SGBV crimes. In Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo , the OTP was presented with the opportunity to prosecute SGBV crimes perpetuated aga inst child soldiers. Despite the testimony of thirty -one eyewitnesses \"that sexual violence appeared to be an integral component of the attacks against the civilian population,\"285 the OTP refused to add SGBV charges. The OTP conceded that SGBV was committe d, but did not believe that it reached the threshold of a pattern or policy.286 In Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga , the OTP for the first time charged SGBV as crimes against humanity and war crimes, including rape and sexual slavery.287 The Trial Chambers acquitted Katanga of rape and sexual slavery, but ultimately found him guilty of other war crimes and crimes against humanity.288 While advocates for gender justice have made strides in altering the language of SGBV and elevating its gra vity in the Rome Statute, in practice, the Court has been much less progressive in applying these normative shifts to international humanitarian law language.289 279 LOUISE CHAPPELL , THE POLITICS OF GENDER JUSTICE AT THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT 87 (2016). 280 NANCY FRASER , Social Justice in the Age of Identity Politics: Redistribution, Recognition and Participation , in REDISTRIBUTION OR RECOGNITION : A POLITICAL -PHILOSOPHICAL EXCHANGE 21 (Nancy Fraser et al. eds., 2003). 281 CHAPPELL , supra note 27 9, at 92. 282 Rome Statute, supra note 1 5, at art. 8. 283 Id. at art. 7. 284 Id. at art. 6. 285 CHAPPELL , supra note 279, at 111 (quoting Brigid Inder). 286 Id. at 111 -12. 287 Id. at 119. 288 Id. at 119 -20. 289 Id. at 103 -29 (surveying progress, or lack thereof, of SGBV prosecutions before the ICC). 403 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 V. CONCLUSION For the majority of international humanitarian jurisprudence, the gravity of SGBV ha s been relegated to the peripheral backwaters of international criminal prosecutions. During the post -war international military tribunals, widespread SGBV crimes were barely addressed, and when they were, the actual, individualized harm and extent of the crimes were minimized. SGBV has historically been linked to outdated \"family honor\" provisions in foundational IHL documents, which emphasize moral transgressions over the physical and psychological harm inflicted on victims. This characterization of SGBV as principally a damage to honor additionally reinforces harmful gender stereotypes and distances the perpetrator from the violent crime itself. Moreover, the failure of the Geneva Conventions to explicitly enumerate any act of SGBV as a grave breach signa ls that these crimes are lower on the IHL hierarchy and are not subject to universal jurisdiction. Women lawyers and jurists led the process of elevating SGBV in the international criminal tribunals by prosecuting perpetrators for SGBV as free -standing cr imes against humanity and war crimes, and as components of genocide. Most notably, the strategy of using SGBV to prove the actus reus of grave breaches and subsequently charging SGBV as a constituent crime was developed at the tribunals. This has been vita l in the mission to enumerate SGBV as free -standing crimes and elevate these crimes in the IHL hierarchy. At the Rome Conference, feminist lawyers and activists formed the WCGJ and embarked on the radical endeavor to expand the language surrounding SGBV an d deinstitutionalize the language from its patriarchal roots. Their endeavor was partially successful: SGBV was effectively delinked from honor provisions and a more expansive list of SGBV crimes are under the purview of the Court. However, the Rome Statut e's definition of gender is circular and tainted by biological essentialism and much of the feminist language was diluted in favor of a more moderate approach. The story of the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice is a fascinating study of the state of human rights in the 1990s: a unique confluence of events in international governance provided the WCGJ with a fortuitous opportunity to institutionalize gender into the Rome Statute with a surprising level of success. The WCGJ benefitted from the paradigmatic f uror of the human rights wave, the product of distinct epochal ruptures of the fin de si\u00e8cle . This era can be characterized by the valuation of individual human rights over state sovereignty and anti -impunity as an \"explanatory framework for understanding what had just happened.\"290 In the rush to salvage the international community's failures to prevent genocide, the prosecution of past wrongs was ingrained in international criminal law as a model, first at the ad hoc tribunals and then at the International Criminal Court. A new thirst for prosecution materialized, and the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice seized that opportunity to infuse more progressive language on gender into the Rome Statute. In order to fully elevate the status of SGBV, there must be a considerable normative shift in the language used to conceptualize SGBV. It is imperative to unequivocally and authoritatively affirm SGBV as free -standing grave breaches of the Geneva Conventio ns. This need can only be fully achieved by a dramatic reconceptualization of SGBV and gender under IHL. While this goal is lofty, it may be achieved in a variety of ways. First, existing 290 Hoffmann, supra note 7, at 282. 2020 ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME: A JURISPRUDENTIAL GENEALOGY OF FEMINISM, SEXUAL AND GENDER- BASED VIOLENCE, AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW 404 treaties may be amended to modernize language and enumerate SGBV as a grave breach. Second, criminal tribunals such as the International Criminal Court may broaden SGBV interpretations through its case law, as witnessed at the international criminal tribunals. Third, more progressive language on SGBV may be drafted into ne w bodies of IHL, such as the new convention on crimes against humanity currently being drafted by the International Law Commission. Finally, and most radically, an entirely new treaty that adopts WCGJ language on gender and SGBV could be constructed. Given the divisive debates over language related to gender in the relatively recent negotiation of the Rome Statute, this is the least practical option. Proponents of gender justice must make continual legal strides to elevate SGBV, eliminate archaic language l inking SGBV to honor, embrace an intersectional definition of gender, and recognize sexual and gender -based violence as violence qua violence. 405 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 APPENDIX Figure 1 This n -gram illustrates the increasing popularity of terms related to sexual violence. Both \"sexual violence\" and \"violence against wom en\" take off in use in the late 1970s, shortly after the Mexico City Conference, which failed to adequately address VAW. The use of VAW then rapidly increases beginning around 1987, during the apex of talks regarding VAW at United Nations conferences, part icularly at Beijing, and briefly dips at 2000. Sexual violence is comparatively less popular, but steadily grows in use overtime. Gender violence, on the other hand, is used very infrequently and only begins to leave the x -axis after 1990, and slowly gains in usage throughout the 1990s and 2000s. SGBV all together was so unused that it could not be graphed. 2020 ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME: A JURISPRUDENTIAL GENEALOGY OF FEMINISM, SEXUAL AND GENDER- BASED VIOLENCE, AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW 406 Figure 2 Figure 2 conveys the steady rise in the term \"women's network(s).\" The two are graphed separately in order to allow for variation between the singular and plural. In the early 1970s, the term enters use and experiences a sharp incline after 1975, the year of Mexico City. \"Women's network\" (singular) continues to rise and peaks in 1996, a year after Beijing. \"Women's networks\" (plural) is used less than its singular form, but still experiences growth until 1996. After which, the usage of \"women's network(s)\" tends to wane. HOW TO CLOSE THE GENDER PAY GAP: TRANSPARENCY IN DATA REGARDING COMPENSATION IS THE KEY J.

In 1940, about 28% of women in the United States participated in the labor force.4 However, World War II required about sixteen million men to join the armed forces, which meant women had to play a more active role in the labor force by securing jobs traditionally held by men.5 This allowed some women to shift from low -paying service or retail jobs into higher -wage durable goods manufacturing jobs.6 Even though women started earning more money,7 the wage effects rel ated to increases in the female labor supply were uniformly more negative for women than men.8 Since World War II, there has been a series of legislative efforts to address the gender pay gap. New laws have helped narrow the gender pay gap, but the gap still exists and explaining the causes of the gap is still a big challenge. Data suggests that the re continues to be a systematic undervaluing of the work performed by women in comparison to substantially similar work performed by men. There is no doubt that men, as a whole, earn higher wages than women; however, there is considerable debate as to whet her the wage differences are based on gender discrimination or other factors. More transparency in wage rate reporting is required to properly assess whether gender discrimination is the root cause of the wage gap and, if so, how best to close the gap. One of the most influential federal laws that addressed the United States' gender pay gap is the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (the \"Equal Pay Act), which was signed into law by President Kennedy.9 The Equal Pay Act prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee on the basis of sex.10 This means that employers cannot pay one employee a lower rate than that paid to an employee of the opposite sex in the same establishment if both employees are performing equal or similar work.11 However, employment dec isions that create differences in pay rates between employees can be justified if they are based on a 2 See Gender Pay Gap , CAMBRIDGE BUSINESS ENGLISH DICTIONARY , https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary /english/gender -pay-gap (last visited Mar. 21, 2020).

For example, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals clarified that work only needs to be \"substantially equal,\" rather than identical, to fit within the prote ctions of the Equal Pay Act.13 In Schultz v. Wheaton Glass Company , the Secretary of Labor brought an action against Wheaton Glass Company, claiming that female employees were being discriminated against because they were paid 10% less than male employees who had the same job title.14 The district court ruled that the differences in pay were justified because male employees were able to perform more tasks than women.15 The Third Circuit, however, rejected this conclusion because there was no logic al justification for men to receive 21\u00bd cents per hour more than their female counterparts when the additional tasks performed by men only paid two cents more than what was paid to women performing the same tasks.16 Moreover, Congress intended the Equal Pa y Act to act as a \"broad charter of women's rights in the economic field.\"17 To construe it narrowly, such as requiring the jobs to be identical, would destroy the remedial purposes intended.18 Several other federal laws have been passed to provide more protections to women in the workforce, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.19 Nevertheless, women today continue to earn less than men do in nearly every occupation.20 Although the gap has narrowed since 1963, it has remained relatively uncha nged the past ten years.21 In 2018, women in the United States were paid about 80 cents for every dollar paid to men.22 That disparity in wage rates suggests that women earned about $513 billion less than they would have earned had they received the rates paid to their male counterparts.23 Despite the enacted equal pay laws, it is believed that pay parity between women and men in the United States will not be reached until 2059.24 Concerns about the gender pay gap exist outside of the United States as well. Korea, Estonia, Japan, Latvia, Chile, Canada, and the United Kingdom also have significant national 12 Id. 13 Schultz v.

There is no simple answer, because th e gender pay gap may be a result of many different factors. Although not an exhaustive list, such factors include education, age, experience, familial responsibilities, and workplace choices like demand for overtime. The fact that multiple factors may influence pay rate disparities between men and women does not mean that discrimination does not exist within the workplace, or that discrimination is not a contributing factor when certain compensation decisions are made. Instead, it reveals the importance of trying to figure out which factors contribute the most to the gender pay gap, and, more importantly, why those factors exist. With so many factors at play, the ability to identify and examine wage rate differences across business sectors is critical. T he countries that have made the most progress in closing the gender pay gap are those that have increased transparency regarding compensation between employees within the same establishment. This Article will look at the problem of unequal pay and will a rgue that transparency regarding compensation of men and women must be increased before any decision can be made as to why the gender pay gap exists. This Article proceeds in three parts. Part I provides a comprehensive discussion of existing equal pay law s in the United States that prohibit pay discrimination by sex and an analysis of the most up -to-date data on the current gender pay gap in the United States. It also examines theories as to why or why not there is a pay gap and how clarity can be provided by increasing transparency. Part II provides a comprehensive discussion of the new equal pay laws in the United Kingdom. It also provides an analysis of how the United Kingdom has reduced its gender pay gap by increasing transparency and how these laws ca n provide a road map for improving the pay gap in the United States. Lastly, Part III provides an analysis of the gender pay gap worldwide and how other countries have addressed the gender pay gap by increasing transparency. In order to close the gender pay gap, countries need to amend current equal pay laws or pass new laws to require increased transparency of employer data. Increasing transparency of wage data in the workplace will better highlight the factors that need to b e addressed in order to close the gender pay gap, and it is clear that laws aimed at increasing transparency need to have teeth to ensure compliance. By doing do so, employees and regulators will also be able to more accurately determine whether women are being compensated fairly and whether pay rate disparities between men and women are the result of gender discrimination 25 Devon Delfino, 12 Countries Where Men Earn Significantly More than Women , BUS.

Without this data, it is impossible to know whether and to what extent gender discrimination factors into the pay diff erential between men and women. I.THE GENDER PAY GAP IN THE UNITED STATES The enactment of federal and state legislation has, at times, helped narrow the gender pay gap in the United States; however, the country has in no way achieved pay parity. Although th e gap was reduced significantly toward the end of the 1990s, the gap has remained mostly unchanged since.28For example, from 2010 to 2018, the difference in pay between men and women in the United States hardly improved and even increased at times.29 This chart shows the average weekly earnings for men and women from 2010 to 2018. The percentages represent the gender pay gap for each year. According to the data, the gender pay gap varies year -to-year. Source: Economic Policy Institute30 According to data, it appears that the gender pay gap is going to remain reasonably stable unless changes are made, either through new legislation or a societal shift in the way women are viewed in the workplace. The starting point to understanding how best to close t he gender pay gap is to ascertain how the gender pay gap has increased or decreased over time, in light of federal legislation and other protections that have been put in place. The corollary to that 28EPI, 413 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 is to understand how external factors influence the gend er pay gap notwithstanding the passage of laws that were aimed at closing the gap. Only then can informed decisions be made on whether the gender pay gap can, in fact, be closed, and if so, how best to accomplish this goal. a. Current Equal Pay Laws that Addr ess Wage Discrimination One of the first laws implemented to close the gender pay gap in the United States was the Equal Pay Act, which was signed into law by President Kennedy on June 10, 1963.31 The springboard for the Equal Pay Act was the National War Labor Board, which, in 1942, called for \"equal pay for equal work.\"32 Once the Equal Pay Act was enacted, employers engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce were prohibited from gender -based discrimination in the payment of employee wages.33 The scope of what constituted gender -based discrimination was thereafter molded by the court. One of the first higher courts to interpret the Equal Pay Act was the Third Circuit, which held that comparative jobs need only be \"substantially equa l\" and not identical to determine whether there was gender -based discrimination in the pay received by men and women working in those jobs.34 In Schultz v. Wheaton Glass Company , the Third Circuit explained that whether a job is \"substantially equal\" is determined by the content of a job rather than the title of a job.35 If a job requires substantially equal skills, effort and responsibility, and is performed under similar working conditions, an employer is prohibited from paying unequal wages to men and women.36 Skill takes into account experience, ability, education, and training required to perform a job.37 Effort refers to the amount of physical or mental exertion needed to perform a job.38 Responsibility is the degree of accountability required to perform a job.39 In addition, wage discrimination is only prohibited between jobs within a single establishme nt (i.e., a distinct physical place of business) and not within a business as a whole.40 The only exception is when unusual circumstances are demonstrated.41 Initially, Congress had considered implementing the \"equal pay for comparable worth\" doctrine, r ather than using the term \"substantially equal.\"42 Under the comparable -worth doctrine, sex -based wage discrimination exists if employees in job classifications occupied primarily by women are paid less than employees in job classifications filled primaril y by 31 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d) (2018). 32 Charlotte Alter, Here's the History of the Battle for Equal Pay for American Women , TIME (Apr. 14, 2015), https://time.com/3774661/equal -pay-history/. 33 29 U.S.C. 206(a). 34 Schultz v.

Although courts have not been consistent interpreting this defense, an example of a factor that can be considered by employers is market forces. In Spaulding v. University of Washington , the Ninth Circuit held that pay differences can be justified if employers are constrained by market forces to set salaries under prevailing wage rates for different job classifications.48 The Ninth Circuit has stated that the rationale is that reliance on a free market system in which employees in male -dominated jobs are compensated at higher rate than employees in dissimilar female -dominated jobs is not in and of itself discriminatory.49 A year after the Equal Pay Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted to provide further prohibitions against pay discrimination in the workforce.50 Under Title VII, employers are prohibited from discriminating against any individual with respect to his or her compensation because of the individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.51 This is similar to the Equal Pay Act, and someone who has an Equal Pay Act claim may also have a claim under Title VII. Moreover, Title VII prohibits employers from steering women into lower -paying jobs, unfairly denying women promotions, and otherwise impacting compensation based on gender -based discrimination.52 Unlike the Equal Pay Act, however, Title VII only applies if an employer has more than 15 employees.53 One of the most important similarities between the Equal Pay Act and Title VII is that the affirmative defenses set in the Equal Pay Act are applicable to Title VII actions for sex - based w age discrimination.54 This was made clear by the Bennett Amendment to Title VII, which provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining the amount of wages or compensation p aid or to be paid to employees of such employer if such differentiation is authorized by the Equal 43 AFSCME v. Washington, 770 F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir. 1985). 44 Cty. of Washington v. Gunther, 452 U.S. 161, 184 -88 (1981) (discussing why Congress reject ed comparable -worth doctrine). 45 Id. at 184. 46 Id. 47 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (2018). 48 Spaulding v.

One difference is the requirement to show that there was an intent to discriminate under Title VII. Under the Equal Pay Act, a plaintiff can recover by proving that she received lower pay for substantially equal work.58 In contrast, Title VII claims typically require proof of an intent to discriminate.59 Intent to discriminate is not needed under Title VII, however, if an employee can meet the requirements of a disparate impact claim or prove that sex was a motivating fa ctor for a compensation decision.60 Another difference between the Equal Pay Act and Title VII is the burden -shifting structures. Claims based on Title VII follow the McDonnell -Douglas framework, which is a three -step burden- shifting structure.61 Under this structure, the plaintiff must firs t establish a prima facie case of discrimination.62 If able to do so, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the alleged discriminatory action.63 If the employer is successful, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is in fact pretext.64 In contrast, claims based on the Equal Pay Act follow a two -step structure. In Stanziale v. Jargowsky , the Third Circuit Court of Appeals explained that claims b ased on the Equal Pay Act require the plaintiff to first establish a prima facie case by demonstrating that employees of the opposite sex were paid differently for performing substantially \"equal work.\"65 If able to do so, the burden of persuasion then shi fts to the employer to demonstrate the applicability of one of the affirmative defenses.66 Unlike Title VII claims, plaintiffs are not given another opportunity to prevail and will not be successful if an affirmative defense is applicable. 55 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e -2(h) (2018). 56 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (2018). 57 Cty. of Washington v.

In 1963, the gender pay gap was 41%.67 In 2018, it was about 20%.68 That measure of improvement is significant, and yet a significant gap remains. It seems logical that additional legislation could help narrow the gender pay gap further, and even President Kennedy acknowledged that the Equal Pay Act was only the \"first step\" and that \"much remains to be done to achieve full equality of economic opportunity.\"69 b. Whether Discrimination Explai ns the Gender Pay Gap Before considering how the gender pay gap can be further reduced, it is important to examine other reasons why the gap exists or is misrepresented. Individuals who support the belief that the gap is misrepresented or does not exist ha ve argued that the gap can be explained by factors other than discrimination, such as the choices women make at the workplace and responsibilities women have outside of the workplace.70 In contrast, individuals who believe that the gender pay gap is a dire ct result of discrimination have argued that data explicitly shows that the earnings of women are less than men when considering certain aspects of the workplace and achievements.71 Whichever side you support, it is beyond peradventure that women are gener ally being paid less than men. Even if the pay gap is not a direct result of gender -based wage discrimination, men generally make more than women at all ages, education levels, and within all occupations.72 As for the gender pay gap between men and women of certain ages, it is clear that women make less than men no matter how old they are. Additionally, the gap tends to widen drastically for women once they turn 35.73 Those that believe the gap does not exist or is misrepresented will try to rely on the f act that women tend to demand less hours or more flexible schedules in the workplace as they get older.74 This can be explained by several facts. 67 Lynda Robinson, Here's how The Washington Post relegated JFK signing the landmark Equal Pay Act to the women's page , WASHINGTON POST (Apr.

Second, employed women living with a child under the age of 6 generally work an average of 4.3 hours per day.76 This means that these mother s only work about 30 hours per week, which can explain why women demand less overtime compensation.77 Third, of the workers who take time off, such as for parental, family or medical leave, women are twice as likely to experience a negative impact on their job or career than men.78 In 2011, it was reported that 60% of men had access to paid leave, while o nly 57% of women had access.79 This means that women were less likely than men to have access to paid leave, which would result in women being more likely to take leave without pay. Consequently, this data reveals that factors unrelated to discrimination c an help explain why women generally earn less than their male counterparts. Although there are explanations as to why the gap is the widest for women over the age of 35 and for women with children, it does not explain the gender pay gap for women of all ages with different types of responsibilities. For example, the median weekly earnings for women that were 24 or younger was $558, while the median weekly earnings for the men in this same age bracket was $624.80 Similarly, the median weekly earnings for w omen that were 34 or younger was $763, while the median weekly earnings for the men of this age bracket was $877.81 Thus, women under the age 35 earn about 90% of what men earn.82 75 WOMEN 'S BUREAU , Overview of Working Women Toda y, U.S. DEP'T OF LABOR , https://www.dol.gov/wb/overview.htm (last visited Mar. 26, 2019); WOMEN 'S BUREAU , Mothers and Families , U.S. DEP'T OF LABOR ., https://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/mother_families -text.htm#LFPMarital -Age (last visited Mar. 30, 2019). 76 News Release, U.S. Dep't of Labor, American Time Use Survey - 2017 Results (June 28, 2018) . 77 Id. 78 Juliana Menasce Horowitz et al., Americans Widely Support Paid Family and Medical Leave, but Differ Over Specific Policies , PEW RES.

According to the data, the difference in pay between men and women significantly increases once women turn the age of 25. Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics83 Similar to the gap in pay for women of different age s, there is also a gap between men and women at every level of education. The general idea behind achieving another degree is that earnings increase for both men and women as years of education increase. Accordingly, this might suggest that an increase in education will actually reduce the gender pay gap.84 Although the earnings of women do increase as they pursue higher levels of education, the gender pay gap does not decrease.85 Individuals that believe the gender pay gap does not exist or is misreprese nted have argued that the gap regarding education can be explained by other factors, such as the types of degrees pursued by women in college.86However, according to the different earnings men and women receive at each educational level, women must obtain one more degree than men in order to receive similar compensation. For example, the median weekly earnings for women with a high school degree is only $9 more than the median weekly earnings for men with less than a high school diploma.87Moreover, men ex perience a larger increase in earnings than women do when an advanced degree is obtained.

Although the types of degrees pursued in college may explai n the pay gap for some women, this does not explain the gender pay gap for women of all educational levels with different types of degrees and achievements. This chart shows data from 2019 regarding differences in pay between men and women with certain educational levels. According to the data, women must obtain at least one more degree than men in order to have similar earnings. Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics90 Lastly, there is a difference in pay between men and women in nearly all occupations. Skeptics about the realities of gender -based wage discrimination have explained this fact in a variety of ways. The first argument is that the gap within an occupation can be explained by the fact that women make different choices in the workplace than men do, which leads to women being paid less.91For example, a group of Harvard professors have asserted that the pay differences of employees working at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 88Id. 89Id. 90Id. DegreeBachelor's DegreeAdvanced DegreeMEDIAN WEEKLY EARNINGS BY EDUCATION Women Men Total 2020 HOW TO CLOSE THE GENDER PAY GAP: TRANSPARENCY IN DATA REGARDING COMPENSATION IS THE KEY 420 (\"MBTA\") can be explained by women valuing workplace flexibility more than men and women having a lower demand for overtime work hours than men.92 This argument is based in part on the belief that women have other responsibilities outside of the workforce, such as taking care of c hildren. However, according to the President's 2015 Economic Report, workplace flexibility policies can actually help families meet both their family and professional goals, while also benefitting women and the economy.93 The second argument is that pay differentials occur within an occupation because men and women tend to gravitate toward different industries.94 However, the gap does not change drastically whether a certain occupation or industry employs more women than men. In those occupations where wo men represented 50% or more of the workforce, the average gender pay gap was still 87.24%, meaning that men were still being compensated at a higher level.95 Similarly, in the occupations where women represented less than 50% of the workforce, the average gender pay gap was 81.27%.96 Moreover, in 2018, it was reported that the median weekly earnings of men are higher than the median weekly earnings of women across almost every occupation.97 Certain occupations may have higher or lower gaps than others, but there is no tangible correlation between the percentage of women in a specific occupation or industry and the gender pay gap. Median Weekly Earnings for All Employees Median Weekly Earnings for Men Median Weekly Earnings for Women Gender Pay Gap Occupations that Women Represent < 50% of All Employees $895 $995 $845 87.24% Occupations that Women Represent > 50% of All Employees $1,099 $1,183 $952 81.27% This chart shows data from 2018 regarding the percentage of women in a certain occupation.

Although data reveals that women are generally being paid less than men, the presence of alternative methods to measure the gap can create skepticism that analyzing data is a reliable method to measure the gap.106 No matter how you measure the gender pay gap, it is clear that th ere is a difference in pay between men and women. Since it is believed that pay parity will not be reached until 2059,107 the United States needs to consider additional approaches to figure out what is causing pay inequalities. This can be done by examini ng aspects of the labor market and how social norms of women have changed over time. However, this could lead to conflicting reports, similar to how arguments based on gender pay gap data are perceived. Instead, the United States should consider several pr oposed laws and systems that could help increase transparency regarding compensation between men and women within the workforce. Although passing new laws over the past 60 years has not eliminated gender pay differences, there does seem to be a correlation between new laws and a closing of the gender pay gap. This chart shows the average gender pay gap from 1963 to 2018. According to the data, the gender pay gap tends to be reduced after an equal pay law is enacted.

The Paycheck Fairness Act One piece of proposed legislation that should be considered is the Paycheck Fairness Act (the \"PFA\").109 The intended purpose of the PFA is to \"amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide more effective remedies to [women discriminated against] in the payment of wages on the basis of sex.\"110 The PFA also would provide procedural protections to the Equal Pay Act.111 The rationale for introducing the bill was because Congress determined that, despite the enactment of the Equal Pay Act, many women continue to earn significantly lower pay than men for equal work, which suggests that pay disparities must be the result of continued intentional discrimination or the lingering effects of past discrimination.112 The first benefit of enacting the PFA would be to update the definition of a work \"establishment\" under the Equal Pay Act.113 Under the Equal Pay Act, a determination of wage discrimination is based on the comparison of the earnings between a male and female employee who perform \"substantially equal\" jobs and work within the same \"establishment.\"114 If the PFA is passed, the legal definition of \"establishment\" would be broadened. According to the PFA, wage comparisons may be made between employees who perform substantially equal jobs at any of the employer's places of business that are located in the same country or political subdivision.115 This is essential because many businesses today operate of out multiple offices in the same area. The second potential benefit of the PFA would be to clarify the \"factor other than sex\" defense in the Equal Pay A ct.116 Under the Equal Pay Act, an employer will not be liable if the employer can show that a pay differential is based on a seniority or merit system, the quality or quantity of production, or a factor other than sex.117 However, the Equal Pay Act does not explain what constitutes a \"factor other than sex.\" The PFA would provide guidance as to what qualifies as a \"factor other than sex,\" which would result in more consistent interpretations by courts. According to the PFA, a \"factor other than sex\" defense must be based on a bona fide, job -related factor, such as education, training, or experience that is consistent with business necessity.118 In addition, a factor will not qualify as an affirmative defense if the employee can show that the employer refused t o implement an existing 109 Paycheck Fairness Act, S. 862, 114th Cong.

According to the PFA, prevailing plaintiffs could recover both compensatory and punitive damages.123 The last potential benefit of the PFA would be to prohibit employers from r etaliating against employees for sharing salary information with coworkers.124 This would increase transparency regarding wage discrimination because employees would be able to learn about wage disparities and evaluate whether they are being discriminated a gainst. Under the Equal Pay Act, employers are prohibited from retaliating against an employee who asserts his or her rights under the Act, but it does not address situations involving salary discussions.125 According to the PFA, employers would not be able to retaliate against employees for either seeking redress or inquiring about the wage practices of the employer.126 Allowing transparency of wage differences without the fear of retaliation is critical to providing societal- based factors to work alongside legislation to address the gender pay gap. Although the PFA has been struck down on numerous occasions, it was recently reintroduced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in January 2019.127 Since the Republicans currently control the Senate it is possible that the PFA may be struck down a fifth time. ii. The Fair Pay Act Another introduced law that should be considered is the Fair Pay Act (the \"FPA\").128 According to the bill, the purpose of the FPA is to \"amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit discrimin ation in the payment of wages on account of sex, race, or national origin, and for other purposes.\"129 The FPA would also amend certain aspects of the Equal Pay Act. However, the last time it was introduced it was struck down.130 The first potential benefi t of the FPA would be to expand the current protections of the Equal Pay Act to additional women in the workforce. Under the Equal Pay Act, gender -based wage discrimination is prohibited only between workers performing \"substantially\" the same 119 See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 3(a)(B)(iv). 120 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e -2(k)(1)(A)(i) Act, \u00a7 3(c)(1) (2015). 122 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 Fairness Act, S. 862, Cong. \u00a7 3(c)(1) (2015). 124 Id. at \u00a7 3(b). 125 See 29 U.S .C. \u00a7 215(a)(3) (2018).

Revised EEO -1 Since neither the Paycheck Fairness Act nor the Fair Pay Act has been passed, it is unclear whether these bills would actually further reduce the gender pay gap. Thus, the United States needs to consider solutions other than a mending the current equal pay laws. Since it is unclear what factors contribute the most to the gender pay gap, the United States should consider increasing transparency regarding compensation between men and women employees. For example, transparency can be increased by collecting pay data from employers concerning pay for both men and women, including based on job titles, education levels and work experience. This allows data to be used to focus efforts on certain industries 131 See Schultz v. Wheaton Glass Co., 421 F.2d 259, 265 (3d Cir. 1970).

This kind of d ata collection system has been successfully implemented by many countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and Iceland.143 More importantly, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") has already taken the initiative to implement such a system in the United States.144 In 2010, the EEOC and other agencies were asked by President Obama to identify ways to improve enforcement of federal laws prohibiting pay discrimination.145 This led to the idea of collecting data from certain employer s in order to analyze the correlation between employee gender and compensation.146 The idea of collecting data is not novel. Since 1966, the EEOC has required employers with 100 or more employees to file a report, an EEO -1, that describes the number of indi viduals employed by a job category, i.e., sex, race, and ethnicity.147 However, the EEOC would like to make revisions to EEO -1 so more data can be gathered and analyzed, which hopefully can better explain the gender pay gap. On July 14, 2016, the EEOC sou ght approval from the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\") to revise the EEO -1 data collection system by including two new components.148 The first component collects the same data that is gathered by the currently approved EEO -1, but includes data about an employee's ethnicity, race, and sex regarding a job category.149 The second component collects data on employees' W -2 earnings and hours worked, which EEO - 1 filers are already required to maintain in the \"ordinary course of business.\"150 This data would then be formatted into twelve pay bands for the ten EEO -1 job categories.151 Both components would apply to filers, both private sector businesses and Federal contractors, who have 100 or more employees.152 However, contractors with 50 to 99 employees would only need to submit data required under the first component.153 Although O MB approved of the first component, they believed the second component violated the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.154 Under this Act, an agency that proposes to collect information must first conduct its own evaluation of the need for the collection of this information and what types of burdens this would create.155 Upon completion of this 143 See infra Parts II.C & III. 144 Press Release, U.S. EQUAL EMP'T OPPORTUNITY COMM 'N, EEOC Announces Proposed Addition of Pay Data to Annual EEO -1 Reports (Jan. 29, 2016). 145 Agency Information Collection Activities: Revision of the Employer Information Report (EEO -1) and Comment Request, 81 Fed.

By requiring certain data from employers on gender and earnings, compensation decisions of certain employers will be brought to light. It will also help determine whether there is tr ue discrimination in certain workforces, and whether other factors are being considered during compensation decisions. More importantly, these reports will be available to the public. Publicization of the reports may lead to public embarrassment or critici sm for some employers, but this may incentivize employers to change their policies in order to report more favorable data the following year. II. THE GENDER PAY GAP IN THE UNITED KINGDOM The gender pay gap is not only a problem in the United States. According to a 2018 - 2019 global wage analysis conducted by the International Labour Organization (\"ILO\"), the median gender pay gap in the United States is 18.4% (using hourly wages) and 25.7% (using monthly earnings).164 Although these numbers are large, the United States is not considered to have one of the largest gender pay gaps when compared to the other 73 countries that provided relevant data.165 According to the ILO's analysis, one country with a larger gender pay gap than the United States is the United Kingd om.166 156 Id. 157 Nat'l Women's Law Ctr. v.

The U.K. Equal Pay Act 1970 The United Kingdom did not address issues regarding the gender pay gap until the 1960s. At that time, it had been common practice in the private sector, and parts of the public sector, to have separate and lower rates o f pay for women.167 On June 7, 1968, women at a Ford factory in the United Kingdom discovered that they were being paid about 15% less than men doing the same work.168 Ford refused to amend its compensation policies, and a strike was organized.169 This eventually led to the Un ited Kingdom enacting the Equal Pay Act 1970 (the \"U.K. Equal Pay Act\"), which was designed to prevent discrimination between men and women concerning terms and conditions of employment.170 In addition, the U.K. Equal Pay Act introduced an implied equality clause into all employment contracts, which eliminated separate and lower rates of pay.171 Although the U.K. Equal Pay Act was designed to provide equal pay for men and women performing equivalent work, employers were still able to figure out ways to pay m en and women differently.172 Even though the U.K. Equal Pay Act was enacted in 1970, it was not implemented until 1975.173 This provided employers time to discover methods to avoid complying with the Act. For example, employers re -graded jobs and changed job titles of employees, which justified pay differences between men and women even if both were performing equivalent work. In addition, the term \"equivalent\" was not clear.174 For example, an employer could raise women pay rates to the lowest pay rates of me n. Thus, even if the jobs of women were more demanding than the jobs of men the terms and conditions for women were still \"not less favourable\" than those of men. b. The U.K. Equality Act 2010 Since pay inequalities still existed after the U.K. Equal Pay Ac t, the United Kingdom decided to replace several of its equal pay laws. This led to the enactment of the Equality Act 2010 (the \"U.K. Equality Act\"), which was designed to ensure that men and women, full-time or part -time, were given equal pay. 175 The U.K. Equality Act was also able to provide more protections to women in the workforce by changing certain provisions of the U.K. Equal Pay Act. One important change that was made under the U.K. Equality Act was that employers could not discriminate regarding pay, benefits, terms and conditions if men and women are performing \"equal work,\" as opposed to \"equivalent work.\"176 Another change was that 167 Equal Pay & the Equal Pay Act 1970 , NAT'L EDUC.

While the U.K. Equal Pay Act only prohibited discriminatio n in the workplace,177 the U.K. Equality Act expanded protection against discrimination in society as a whole.178 The type of discrimination prohibited was also expanded. The U.K. Equal Pay Act requires discrimination to be based on a protected characteristi c.179 Whereas the U.K. Equality Act prohibited direct and indirect discrimination, which means a woman does not need to prove they are being paid less than a man in order to bring a claim.180 For example, with the changes under the U.K. Equality Act, a woman could bring a claim against an employer simply because a provision, criterion, or practice of an employer particularly disadvantaged her. c. The Equality Act 2010 Regulations 2017 Although the U.K. Equality Act provided more protections to women in the workforce, the gender pay gap still remained an issue in the United Kingdom. In 2010, it was reported that the United Kingdom gender pay gap was still 19.8%.181 Moreover, it was reported that, even with the new laws, it could still take almost a century before pay parity was achieved.182 Instead of enacting additional laws that were similar to the U.K. Equality Act, the United Kingdom decided to take a new approach - to increase transparency wit hin the workforce. The first time the United Kingdom tried to address pay inequalities by increasing transparency was in 2011. The Government Equalities Office implemented the Think, Act, Report initiative, which asked employers to publish any gender pay g ap information that could help achieve gender equality.183 The biggest downfall of this initiative, however, was that compliance was voluntary for employers.184 Accordingly, the United Kingdom decided that it needed to legally require employers to comply wit h this reporting system and provide guidelines as to what information needed to be reported. In 2017, the United Kingdom amended the U.K. Equality Act by implementing two regulations: the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/172) (the \"2017/172 Regulations\"); and the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/353) (the \"2017/353 Regulations\") (collectively, the \"Regulations\").185 177 Equal Pay Act 1970, c. 41, \u00a7 1(1) (Eng.). 178 Equality Act 2010, c. 15, Ch. 2 (Eng.). 179 Equal Pay Act 1970 c. 41, \u00a7 1(1)(a) (Eng.). 180 Equality Act 2010, c. 15, Ch. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 19 (Eng.). 181 OFFICE FOR NAT'L.

General Application of the Regulations The 2017/172 Regulations came into force on April 6, 2017.186 According to the 2017/172 Regulations, private and voluntary sector employers with 250 or more employees are required to publish and report specific data regarding its gender pay gap annually.187 Any employer who fits within this criteria is referred to as a \"relevant employer.\"188 In addition, relevant employers are required to provide details on gaps related to average bonuses paid and the proportion of men and women who received bonuses.189 The term \"relevant employer\" includes both private and public sectors. Private sector organizations that are part of a group must report individually if they are relevant employers, and this information must be reported by April 5th each year.190 Originally, the Re gulations did not consider public or government authorities as a \"relevant employer.\"191 However, the United Kingdom included public sector employers under the Regulations by enacting the 2017/353 Regulations, which came into force on March 31, 2017.192 Relevant employers in the public sector include government departments, the armed forces, local authorities, NHA bodies, and most schools.193 As for the requirements of relevant employers, these employers must do two things. First, relevant employers must publi sh specific gender pay gap data and a written statement on its website.194 This data must be kept on the website for at least three years.195 Second, relevant employers must also publish this data on a government website, 196 which is designated by the Secretary of State and must be published by March 30th each year. The Regulations increase transparency by making gender pay gap information available to the public. However, the United Kingdom also made sure that the required i nformation covered a broad range of topics that could impact pay inequalities in the workplace. Pursuant to the Regulations, a relevant employer is required to publish the following information each year: 1.) The difference between both the mean and median hou rly rate of pay for women and men that are full -time employees; 2.) The difference between both the mean and median bonus pay for women and men; 3.) The proportions of female and male employees who were paid bonus pay; and 186 Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, SI 2017/172, \u00a7 1(1) (Eng.). 187 Id. at Explanatory Notes \u00b6 1. 188 Id. at \u00a7 1(2). 189 Id. 190 Id. 191 Id. at \u00a7 1(6). 192 Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017, SI 2017/353, \u00a7 1(1) (Eng.). 193 See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 2(3) -(5). 194 Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, SI 2017/172, \u00a7 15(1)(a) (Eng.). 196 Id. at \u00a7 15(2). 2020 HOW TO CLOSE THE GENDER PAY GAP: TRANSPARENCY IN DATA REGARDING COMPENSATION IS THE KEY 432 4.)

The Results After Implementing the Regulations The goal of the Regulations was to shine a light on the pay practices of employers and what factors could stall career adv ancements of women. By requiring relevant employers to publish and report gender pay gap information, the United Kingdom anticipated these reports would incentivize employers to avoid or respond to negative results, which would then reduce pay inequalities within the workforce. The Regulations came into force on April 6, 2017, and more than 10,000 employers publicly reported their gender pay gap data the following year.198 It was clear that the reports were going to produce embarrassing and uncomfortable results for several large employers. The data indicated that more than 78% of all relevant employers paid men more than women and that the median pay gap was around 9.7%.199 Moreover, the data produced significant results for certain industries, particularly banks, airlines, and soccer clubs. Goldman Sachs' Britain office reported that women were paid an average of 56% less than men.200 WIPP, a British advertising company, rep orted that women received about 25% less than their male counterparts.201 In addition, Stoke City Football Club reported women earned about 30.5% less than their male counterparts regarding mean hourly earnings.202 Furthermore, the Regulations induced empl oyers to address current compensation policies. For example, EasyJet, the United Kingdom's busiest discount airline, reported that men earned about 52% more than women.203 After reporting and publishing this data, a male executive of EasyJet took a 4.6% pay cut to match the salary of his female predecessor and pledged to more than triple the wages of its female pilots.204 In addition, some companies tried to weaken the negative results of reports by providing its own interpretation of the data. In 2018, it wa s reported that PwC (U.K.) had the largest gap among the \"Big Four\" accounting firms with a gender pay gap of 43.8%.205 Instead of remaining silent after publishing its report, PwC (U.K.) addressed its gender pay gap report from 2018 by publishing a supplem ental report. Although PwC (U.K.) was considered to have the highest gap amongst its peers, it was evident that the mean gender pay gap decreased 0.6% from 197 Id. at \u00a7\u00a7 2(1)(a) -(f). 198 See id. at \u00a7 1(1).

For example, Mills & Reeve LLP, a British law firm, determined that it was paying wo men 32% less than men.208 Even though executives and partners of the firm did not feel obliged to make changes to improve their pay gap, large clients of the firm requested more female representation from the firm.209 Thus, it is clear that the Regulations a re having an impact on employers, and data has shown that the Regulations have impacted the overall gender pay gap in the United Kingdom. From 2017 to 2018, the gender pay gap for all employees dropped from 18.4% to 17.9%.210 More importantly, the Regulatio ns increased transparency as to which factors contributed significantly to the gender pay gap. After receiving data from relevant employers for the first time, it was reported that the overall pay gap was higher than the pay gap of part - time employees.211 This is presumably because part -time workers tend to earn less than full - time workers, and women are more likely to have part -time jobs. In addition, this could be because women are less likely to drop out of the labor market around the time they have their first child and are more likely to stay in paid work in the years following.212 The Regulations provided the necessary data to further support these presumptions. After the Regulations were enforced, it was reported that 39% of all women employed were part -time, while only 12% of all men employed were part -time.213 In addition, the pay gap widened substantially for women after the birth of their first child.214 Based on the data collected, the United Kingdom can now justify implementing additional measures th at focus on specific groups of employees, such as women with children. iii. Problems that Remain After the Regulations The rationale for enacting the Regulations in the United Kingdom was to increase transparency regarding the gender pay gap. Under the Regulations, women are able to discover whether men in similar positions are being paid more or less, which allows the public to know whether discrimination is a factor.215 Although transparency is improved, there are several problems with the Regulations. 206 See PWC, DIVERSITY PAY REPORT 2018 3 (2018). 207 See id. at 2. 208 Alderman, supra note 200. 209 Id. 210 Briefing Paper 7068, supra note 26 , at 7. 211 See id. at 6. 212 BARRA ROANTREE & KARTIK VIRA, INST.

Unlike the private sector, it is evident that the Equality and Human Rights Commission (the \"E HRC\") is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the reporting requirements of relevant employers in the public sector. Based on the explanatory memorandum of the 2017/353 Regulations, \"[t]he [EHRC] is responsible for monitoring how public authorities ar e complying with the specific duties and can take enforcement action.\"216 In addition, the EHRC has published an enforcement policy that encourages relevant employers to meet the requirements of the Regulations.217 The enforcement policy states that the EHRC has the ability to investigate non-compliant businesses and issue publi c sector duty compliance notices for failure to comply with reporting duties.218 Thus, the text of the enforcement policy and of the Regulations makes it is clear that the EHRC can enforce the reporting requirements in the public sector.219 On the other ha nd, it is unclear whether the same holds true for the private sector. Under the explanatory memorandum of the 2017/172 Regulations, \"[f]ailure to comply with these Regulations would be an unlawful act...and would fall within the existing enforcement powers o f the [EHRC].\"220 Unlike the 2017/353 Regulations, the 2017/172 Regulations do not explicitly state who has the authority to monitor relevant employers in the private sector. Instead of stating that the EHRC is \"responsible\" and \"can take enforcement action ,\" the 2017/172 Regulations only say that it \"would fall within the existing powers of the [EHRC].\"221 Moreover, the enforcement policy of the EHRC does not mention private sector employers.222 It could be argued that the Government intended for the EHRC t o monitor private sector employees. Under the 2017/172 Regulations, \"[f]ailure to comply with an obligation imposed by these Regulations constitutes an 'unlawful act' within the meaning of section 34 of the Equality Act 2006 (c. 3), which empowers the [EHR C] to take enforcement action.\"223 The problem is that this statement is only found in the explanatory notes and not in the actual text. Moreover, the 2017/172 Regulations are issued under section 78 of the U.K. Equality Act.224 According to section 78, \"[t] he regulations may make provision for a failure to comply with the regulations \u2014(a) to be an offense punishable on summary conviction by a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale; (b) to be enforced, otherwise than as an 216 See Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public A uthorities) Regulations 2017, SI 2017/353, Explanatory Memorandum \u00b6 7.16. 217 EQUALITY & HUMAN RIGHTS COMM 'N, CLOSING THE GAP : ENFORCING THE GENDER PAY GAP REGULATIONS (2018) [hereinafter EHRC]. 218 See id. at 1-3. 219 See id. 220 See Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, SI 2017/172, Explanatory Memorandum \u00b6 7.12. 221 Compare id. , with Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017, SI 2017/353, supra note 21 6, at \u00b6 7.16. 222 EHRC, supra note 21 7. 223 See Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, SI 2017/172, Explanatory Notes \u00b6 13 (Eng.). 224 See Equality Act 2010, c. 15, pt. 5, Ch. 3, \u00a7 78 (Eng.). 435 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 offence, by such means as a re prescribed.\"225 However, neither section 78 nor the 2017/172 Regulations state which department, agency, or public body has the responsibility to enforce compliance of these requirements. It seems that Parliament intended explicitly for enforcement pol icies of the 2017/172 Regulations to be stated in the regulation itself. Parliament could have stated that failure to comply with the Regulations would be considered an unlawful act within the meaning of the U.K. Equality Act of 2006, but it did not. It is also possible that the EHRC will apply its enforcement powers to the private sector even though it is not required to. However, such a belief is misleading because the EHRC does not have the resources to monitor relevant employers in both sectors. Durin g the first year the Regulations were enforced, it was reported that over 10,000 employers reported gender pay gap data.226 Accordingly, it is unlikely that the EHRC will be able to monitor and take action against relevant employers of both sectors who fail to comply with the Regulations. Another issue related to enforcement is the inability to monitor relevant employers in both the private and public sectors, because the Regulations do not impose civil or criminal penalties if relevant employers fail to com ply with the reporting requirements. Under the Regulations, relevant employers are prohibited from evading the reporting requirements unless a specific exception applies. The first exception applies when an employee is employed under a contract personally to do work.227 The second exception applies when an employer does not possess data on an employee, or when it is not reasonably practicable for an employer to obtain data on an employee.228 Although the affirmative defenses of the Regulations are clearer tha n those of the U.K. Equality Act, there is no civil or criminal penalty for relevant employers if they fail to comply with the reporting requirements altogether. The only penalty an employer may experience is reputational damage, which may result in higher societal pressure to change. A second problem with the Regulations is the number of relevant employers in the private sector that are required to report data. Relevant employers in the private sector only account for about 0.1% of all businesses.229 In 201 8, it was reported that about 8,000 private sector businesses qualified as relevant employers or were required to comply with the reporting requirements.230 This means that the Regulations only cover about 33% of all employees in the United Kingdom.231 Therefore, the United Kingdom should consider expanding the definition of \"relevant employer\" to include small and medium sized enterprises (\"SMEs\"), which refers to 225 See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 78(5)(a) -(b). 226 What is the Gender Pay Gap at Your Company? , BBC (Apr. 5, 2018), https://www.bbc.com/news/business -43632763. 227 Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, SI 2017/172, \u00a7 2(3)(a) (Eng.). 228 Id. at \u00a7 2(3)(b). 229 Chris Rhodes, Business Statistics 5, (House of Commons Library Briefing Paper No. 06152, 2019) [hereinafter Briefing Paper 06152]. 230 Id. 231 See id .; Angela Henshall, What Iceland can Teach the World about Gender Pay Gaps , BBC (Feb.

If ab le to do so, about 35,000 additional private sector employers would be required to report gender pay gap information.234 This would quadruple the total number of private sector employers that must comply with the Regulations.

According to the data, if the reporting requirements of the Regulations were expanded to medium -sized businesses then about 35,000 companies would be added to the list of companies that are required to report gender pay gap information. Source: BEIS, Business Population Estimates235 Nevertheless, expanding the definition of \"relevant employer\" to employers with fewer employees is only beneficial if the United Kingdom can improve enforcement or make relevant employers comply with the Regulations. This is because it is clear that current relevant employers are taking advantage of the unclear language in the Regulations. Even though it was revealed that 78% of all the relevant employers paid men more than women, some relevant employers simply entered zeroes in every field, reported mathema tically 232 See Briefing Paper 06152, supra note 22 9, at 5. 233 See id. 234 See id. 235 See id. 437 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 impossible numbers, and/or removed certain employees from calculations.236 Also, about 1,500 relevant employers, or about 10%, missed the reporting deadline altogether.237 It is clear that external public pressure is not enough, and the only way to m ake real progress in reducing the pay gap is to impose civil or criminal sanctions for noncompliance with the Regulations. The United Kingdom must do more than increase transparency in order to close the gender pay gap. Nevertheless, the first step of reso lving any issue is to realize that there is an issue. Without the Regulations, companies and regulators seeking to enforce equal pay laws would have scarce evidence that a gap existed and there would also be less pressure to close the gap. Unlike the Unite d States, the United Kingdom has taken the first step and is in a better position to implement additional effective measures to close the gender pay gap. The United Kingdom should first try to resolve enforcement issues by providing clarity as to which dep artment, agency, or public body has authority to enforce compliance and by implementing penalties if relevant employers fail to comply. If successful, the United Kingdom should then try to expand the number of employers that must report and publish gender pay gap information. III. THE GENDER PAY GAP WORLDWIDE The gender pay gap is a global concern that expands beyond the United States and the United Kingdom. As of 2018, it was reported that women globally were paid 63 cents for every dollar paid to men.238 In order to reduce the global gender pay gap, several international organizations have tried to track the gender pay gap among countries. The rationale is that having this information available to the public will raise global awareness of the global gender pay gap and put pressure on countries to close the gender pay gap.239 One organization that has been collecting global gender gap information since 2006 is the World Economic Forum (the \"WEF\"). In addition to tracking this data, the WEF also created the Global Gender Gap Index, which is an annual global report based on information from 149 countries.240 According to the 2018 Global Gender Gap Report, there are two important takeaways about pay between men and women globally. First, on average, women make 6 8% of what men earn.241 Second, based on current trends, it is projected that it will take 108 years to close the global gender pay gap.242 Most equal pay laws make it illegal to pay women less than men. However, if it is illegal to pay women less than men , then why are countries not able to close the global pay gap? 236 See Briefing Paper 7068, supra note 2 6, at 8.

The United States has relied on current equal pay laws and tried to implement a data collection system. On the other ha nd, the United Kingdom has successfully implemented a data reporting system that relies on public transparency and accountability but has experienced issues enforcing the requirements of the system. a. Attempts by Other Countries to Close the Gap Through T ransparency Although the global pay gap is extremely high, some countries have implemented certain measures that are more impactful than measures of other countries. Similar to the United Kingdom, Germany has used transparency to close its pay gap. In 20 17, Germany passed the Remuneration Transparency Act (the \"RTA\").243 The purpose of enacting the RTA was to promote and enforce equal pay between women and men performing equal or equivalent work.244 In order to promote and enforce pay equality, the RTA proh ibits direct and indirect remuneration discrimination based on gender.245 Direct remuneration discrimination exists if an employee earns less based on his or her gender than what an employee of the other gender receives, has received, or will receive for eq ual work or work of equal value.246 In addition, direct discrimination can exist if a woman earns less because of reasons related to pregnancy or maternity.247 Indirect remuneration discrimination exists where apparently neutral provisions, criteria or practices would, on the grounds of gender, put employees at a particular disadvantage compared to employees of the other gender.248 However, such provisions, crite ria, or practices may be objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.249 For example, criteria related to the labor market, performance, and work results can justify differences in pay between men and women.250 Pursuant to the RTA, employees of an employer with over 200 workers have a right to review compensation information so they can compare their remuneration with the pay of colleagues of the opposite sex that perform equal or equivalent work .251 Although this does not allow employees to review the exact pay of other employees, it does allow employees of both genders to examine criteria and procedures used for wage -setting.252 Employees are also able to inspect the average gross monthly salary o f a comparison group, which consists of at least six employees.253 If employers fail to comply with these requests then an employer may 243 Entgelttransparenzgesetz [EntgTranspG] [Transparency in Wage \u00a7 3(1). 246 Id. at \u00a7 3(2) . 247 Id. 248 Id. at \u00a7 3(3). 249 Id. 250 Id. 251 Id. at \u00a7\u00a7 10 -11. 252 Id. 253 Id. at \u00a7 10(1). 439 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 be required to provide evidence in court to show principles of the RTA were not violated.254 Furthermore, if an employer h as more than 500 workers they are legally obligated to provide a report that illustrates the employer's pay structure and gender equality.255 This report must explain how the measures adopted by a company will promote gender equality and equal pay, and must also describe the impact these measures will have on the workforce.256 The assumption is that the RTA will increase transparency, which wi ll increase demands by women for higher pay. These demands will then help close the gender pay gap. This is very similar to the United Kingdom's rationale for enacting the Regulations. In order to create greater transparency, the RTA allows employees to di scover the median remuneration of a group of colleagues of the opposite sex that perform equal or equivalent work.257 The issues with the RTA are very similar to the issues of the Regulations. The RTA does not allow women to discover the exact wages men ear n and does not impose sanctions for non - compliance.258 However, unlike the Regulations, the RTA expands the number of employers required to comply by covering employers with over 200 employees. Another country that has tried to reduce its gender pay gap by increasing transparency is Australia. Although this is similar to the United Kingdom and Germany, Australia's equal pay laws contain more stringent requirements. Since 1998, Australia has required publicly - listed companies to report the wages of senior exe cutives.259 In 2012, Australia enacted the Workplace Gender Equality Act (the \"WGEA\"), which was designed to require certain employers to promote gender equality in the workplace.260 The WGEA also established the Workplace Gender Equality Agency in order to promote and improve gender equality in Australia.261 Under the WGEA, private sector employers with over 100 employees are required to report information regarding gender pay gaps.262 If any employer has over 500 employees then they also must have a formal po licy or strategy in place that improves gender pay issues.263 The equal pay laws of Germany and Australia are very similar. Both countries require smaller employers to comply and employers with over 500 employees are held to a higher standard. Unlike the RT A, however, the WGEA also places a legal obligation on employers to report information and implement strategies and has expanded the requirements for certain industries.264 For example, financial institutions have additional reporting requirements, 254 Id. at \u00a7 15(5). 255 Id. at \u00a7 21. 256 Id. 257 Id. at \u00a7 3. 258 Id. at \u00a7 11(3). 259 Brian Jebb & Sarah Henchoz, INSIGHT: Governments are Increasingly Turning to Pay Disclosure Requirements in an Attempt to Even the Corporate Playing Field , BLOOMBERG L.: DAILY LABOR REPORT 2012 (Cth) pt I s 2A (Austl.). 261 Id. at pt III. 262 Id. at pt I ss 3(1). 263 See id. at pt I s 3, pt IV s 13, pt IVA s 19. 264 Id. at pt I ss 5 sub -divs (7) -(8). 2020 HOW TO CLOSE THE GENDER PAY GAP: TRANSPARENCY IN DATA REGARDING COMPENSATION IS THE KEY 440 which ar e enforced by the Banking Executive Accountability Regime.265 Again, however, the WGEA suffers from the same flaws seen in most of these laws: the inability to enforce these laws because of the lack of civil or criminal penalties if employers fail to comply .266 b. How One Country May Close the Gap by 2022 It is clear that the greatest issue encountered when closing the gender pay gap is the ability to require companies to actually comply with the laws. Accordingly, transparency and public embarrassment are no t enough to force employers to change compensation policies that negatively affect women. A majority of the current policies in place fail to close or reduce the gap because companies lack an incentive to do so if they know they will not be penalized. Howe ver, one country that has resolved this obstacle is Iceland. Iceland has stated its commitment to closing the gender pay gap by 2022.267 Although the WEF reported that Iceland was the top country regarding gender parity for the past nine years, Iceland's ge nder pay gap still remains between 14% and 18%.268 So, is the 2022 goal feasible? The answer is uncertain, but Iceland is the first country to take gender pay gap issues to the next level. On January 1, 2018, Iceland became the first country in the world t o legally enforce equal pay by adopting the Equal Pay Standard (the \"EPS\").269 Pursuant to the EPS, all companies and institutions, public or private, with 25 or more employees are required to annually obtain a \"certificate\" that illustrates pay equality between men and women in the workplace.270 In order to obtain this certificate, employers must implement an equal pay management system that follows the guidelines of the EPS.271 The system must also be approved by an accredited auditor or regulator, who mus t determine whether the system establishes that women and men are being paid equally.272 The overall goal of the EPS is to reduce gender -based wage discrimination and to promote greater equality in wages between women and men.273 However, many countries have had the same goal and failed to close the gap. So, what makes the EPS different from other equal pay laws? First, Iceland has acknowledged that this goal cannot be achieved overnight so employers must be treated differently ba sed on size. Under the EPS, large firms and institutions that have a workforce of more than 250 employees must become certified by 265 See Explanatory Memorandum, Trea sury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017 (Cth) ch 1 ss 1.20, 1.21. (Austl.). 266 See Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 (Cth) pt IVA s 19D (Austl.). 267 Jebb & Henchoz, supra note 25 9. 268 See Emma Charlton, Women in Iceland Have Walked out of Work to Dispute the Gender Pay Gap , WORLD ECON. F. Iceland Makes Equal Pay the Law , TIME (Jan. 4, 2018), http://time.com/5087354/iceland -makes -equal -pay-the-law/. 269 New Icelandic Law on Equal Pay Certification Entered into Force on January 1, 2018 , MINISTRY OF SOC. AFF. (Ice.) (Jan. 4, See Act on Equal Status and Equal Rights of Women and Men, No. 10/2008, as amended by Act No. 162/2010, No. 126/2011, No. 62/2014, No. 79/2015, No. 117/2016, and No. 56/2017 s. 3 art. 18 (Ice.). 271 See id. 272 See id . at s. 2 art. 13. 273 See id. at s. 1 art. 1. 441 CONNECTICUT JOURNAL OF INT'L LAW Vol. 35 the end of 2018, while smaller employers are given more time to receive the certification.274 For example, employers with a wo rkforce between 90 to 149 must become certified by 2020, while employers with a workforce between 25 to 90 must become certified by 2021.275 Thus, all companies and institutions with 25 or more employees must become certified by January 1, 2021. Second, Ic eland has differentiated themselves from most countries in the area of enforcement. Similar to the United Kingdom, Iceland does rely on public embarrassment to force employers to change. However, Iceland took the next step by enforcing civil penalties if an employer fails to receive the certificate on time or violates any provision of the EPS. An employer who fails to comply with the EPS can be fined up to 50,000 ISK, about \u20ac350 or $500, per day of noncompliance.276 In addition, employees can receive compensation for financial and non -financial losses from employers.277 In the end, Iceland is able to do the very thing the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia failed to do when enacting their equal pay laws: having the ability to actually enforce the laws. Although the EPS only applies to about 1,180 employers and 147,000 employees, this represents about 80% of the entire labor force in Iceland.278 To put things into perspective, if the language of the EPS was incorpo rated into the Regulations about 245,000 additional private sector employers in the United Kingdom would be required to comply with the reporting requirements.279 In addition, about 7 million additional employees in the United Kingdom would be covered.280 Altogether, the EPS covers almost 46% more of Iceland's labor force than the Regulations do in the United Kingdom.281 It seems plausible that Iceland will become the first country to close the gap, and it might do so by 2022. In 2018, Reykjavik Energy, one of the largest energy providers in Iceland, reported that 51% of management positions are filled by women and that there was no notable gender pay gap among employees.282 Whereas, it was reported that electricity and gas companies in the United Kingdom have an average gender pay gap of about 15.2%.283 More specifically, British Gas Services Limited (U.K.), which is a subsidiary of one of the largest energy and home services companies in the United Kingdom, reported that women 274 Looking for Information About Equal Pay in Iceland?

It is difficult for female workers to complain about pay inequalities if they are not aware that they are being paid differently. In addition, greater transparency will allow more information to be revealed about wh at factors truly impact the gender pay gap. Although countries have tried to increase transparency, it is clear more is needed to close pay gaps, such as civil penalties. Accordingly, it is not only essential that countries trying to increase transparency provide effective data reporting systems, but also provide for civil and/or criminal penalties for noncompliance with reporting requirements. This chart shows the average gender pay gap regarding hourly earnings for all employees from 2010 to 2018.

Increasing transparency of wage data in the workplace will better highlight the factors that need to be addressed in order to close the gen der pay gap, and it is clear that laws aimed at increasing transparency need to have teeth to ensure compliance. To better understand the root causes of pay disparity between men and women, we need to examine employer wage data. Without this data, it is im possible to know whether and to what extent gender discrimination factors into the pay differential between men and women. Without proper enforcement mechanisms, we cannot know if there has been compliance with data reporting requirements. There is a push, worldwide, to close the gender pay gap. Most of the laws enacted have not closed the gap as quickly as expected, and the laws that appear to be having the most success focus first on transparency of employer wage data. Transparency is the key to understan ding the causes and extent of the pay disparity between men and women, and it is a critical first step therefore in closing the pay gap.
