A 3-year postgraduate therapeutic visual arts program working out of the Anthroposophical understanding of the human being. Program Leaders: Pamela Whitman and Kenneth Smith Multidisciplinary Visual Arts Program: Painting, Sculpture, Drawing, Crafts The Healing Through Art program will guide students to build knowledge, skills, and sensitivity in a range of artistic mediums and practices. The core focus of the program is on color, light and darkness work and sculpture. In support of this, students will develop capacities in form drawing, geometrical drawing, and a number of crafts. The intention is to develop knowledge of the healing potentials of a range of different activities and mediums, so that they may be included in one's therapeutic practice. Artistic work brings us into closer connection with ourselves and with nature. It opens and reveals the inner world through the colors, forms, tones, and lines that we create. It shows us to ourselves and allows us to see, to adjust, to balance, and harmonize. Art becomes healing when the archetypal lawfulness of the medium and the integrity of the creative process are able to enter and work upon the human constitution and engage the self in activating life-giving forces. Each artistic and craft activity addresses and works upon a particular aspect of the human being. Through the very nature of the activity, we are brought into alignment with and allow ourselves to be guided by the forces that stream through all of the world, including ourselves. Part-Time Modular Course Beginning in Summer 2022, the Healing Through Art program will meet in person two times per year (summer and spring) with monthly online classes and a program of weekly artistic assignments. The program will provide a minimum of 280 classroom hours plus an accompanying minimum of 280 hours of mentored, project-based work from home.* The first cohort will begin in Summer 2022 and journey through the program before graduating in Spring 2025, before another cohort begins in Summer 2025. *Requirements of iARTe accrediting body of the Goetheanum A Three-Year Journey The Healing Through Art program will guide students through a deepening process over three years from the hygienic and enlivening aspect of artistic activities into the deeper understanding of human nature, individual life journeys, and the ability to guide artistic therapies. The capacity to work artistically with others in a way that brings healing requires the development of many new personal abilities and sensitivities, knowledge, and practices. Each year supports the developing capacities that will provide a foundation for the following year. Course Outline Year 1 Creating a Foundation Introduction to foundational artistic practices in painting, light and darkness, and sculpture; introduction to Anthroposophic medicine and therapies; the human constitution. Year 2 Artistic Process as Healing Process The 7-fold principle of developmental and metamorphic process and the relevance to the healing process; creating artistic process and sequence; biographical studies.

If a doctor wishes to find a true medicine for a particular patient he must look for the principles of origination of the substance in connection with the development of man's being. If color is to become medicine, the coming into being of color must be traced to its origins in the forces of darkness and light, again in connection with man's being.\" Light, Darkness and Color in Painting Therapy by Liane Collot d'Herbois From the foreword by Elisa M\u00e9trailler Program Leaders Pamela Whitman, M.A. received her B.S. from MIT, where she studied both science and humanities.
