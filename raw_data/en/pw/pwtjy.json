While the use of homeopathy is regionally popular in both human and veterinary medicine, there is still a significant lack of scientific evidence supporting its efficacy. This is likely due to an absence of studies evaluating the mechanism of action of these compounds. Engystol\u00ae an FDA-approved antiviral agent, is a popular homeopathic commercial product. In select in vivo and in vitro observational studies, the drug showed a measureable innate immune therapeutic efficacy. The focus of the present study was to evaluate the innate and adaptive immunomodulatory effects of oral Engystol(\u00ae) (1 or 10 tablets/L water consumed), prior to and post antigenic challenge in a mouse model with a well-characterized and clinically measureable immune system. We first evaluated the murine immune response when oral Engystol(\u00ae) was given alone for 28days. Mice were then challenged with an antigen-specific H5N1 HA vaccine while on Engystol(\u00ae) for an additional 33days. Serum and supernatants from cultured splenic lymphocytes were collected with a 32-cytokine panel. Serum vaccine epitope-specific IgG titers plus T cell and B cell phenotypes from splenic tissue were also evaluated. Preliminary results showed that Engystol(\u00ae) alone did not alter immunity; however, upon vaccine challenge, Engystol(\u00ae) decreased CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios, altered select cytokines/chemokines, and anti-H5N1 HA IgG titers were increased in the 10 tablet/L group. Collectively, these data suggest that Engystol(\u00ae) can modulate upon antigenic IgG; Lymphocyte; Mouse. Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
