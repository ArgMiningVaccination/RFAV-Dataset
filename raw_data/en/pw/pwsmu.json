Just like a car runs best when the tank is filled with the proper grade of gasoline, your body needs the right kind of food. You likely already know to eat organic, whole foods rich in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals and to avoid processed, sugar-rich foods that are full of \"empty\" calories. But as an athlete, you're probably not satisfied with doing the bare minimum. Take your sports nutrition regime to the next level and \"tune-up\" your performance by supplementing with a special group of herbs known as \"adaptogens.\" What are \"adaptogens\" or \"adaptogenic herbs\"? Adaptogenic herbs are herbs that build and strengthen vital force, restore harmony and balance, and greatly improve your body's ability to adapt to stress, whether it's physical or psychological. Scientist Dr. Nickolai Lazarev coined this term in 1947. He used it to describe herbs that can protect the body in stressful and physically demanding conditions by activating the circulatory, nervous, endocrine, and other body systems, reducing stress-induced damage, and promoting regeneration and repair. The definition of \"adaptogenic herbs\" was further refined in 1968 by Dr. Israel I. Brekhman, who stressed that adaptogenic herbs are safe and have no significant side effects or contraindications; have a general, nonspecific action that improves resistance to stress; and exhibit a balancing and normalizing effect on body functions. As these criteria are quite strict, there are only a few herbs that can truly be called adaptogens, including: - American ginseng Panax quinquefolius (L.) - Asian ginseng Panax ginseng somnifera (L.) Schisandra have been shown to support optimal energy and stamina, improve the ability to carry out demanding activities, and enhance the ability to tolerate stress and recover from it. Taking these herbs may also support overall physical and mental health, help maintain an already healthy immune system, and promote normal, healthy functioning of the body. Here's a recap of some influential research for three of the best-studied adaptogenic herbs: 1. Asian Ginseng Asian ginseng P. ginseng is a tonic herb capable of providing non-specific protection against various mental, physical, and environmental forms of stress. It is often used with tiredness and overexertion. It is also claimed to be a general anti-aging tonic for the elderly. Asian ginseng is known as h\u00f3ng shn in China. Historically, in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is given to tonify qi (life energy), and is usually recommended to strengthen the heart, calm the spirit, and generate fluids[1]. It is also considered a sexual tonic in TCM, which is supported by several studies that show Asian ginseng might be helpful with erectile dysfunction.[2] But not only men will benefit from supplementation \u2014 a recent study involving menopausal women showed that ginseng can raise sexual arousal![3] Additional studies have demonstrated that Asian ginseng can help improve abstract thinking, attention, and mental arithmetic skills, and may even reduce reaction times.[4] Interestingly, it was also shown to improve the cognitive function of study participants suffering from [Alzheimer's disease](https://achs.edu/memories-matter-6-easy-tips-for-a-healthy-brain).[5] Further, Asian ginseng is believed to stimulate the immune system, and taking this [herb might help reduce the risk for the common](https://achs.edu/blog/2021/08/12/essential-oil-chemotypes-herbs-part-1/) cold or influenza[6] \u2014 prevention is especially important this time of year! 2. Eleuthero Eleuthero E. senticosus is another widely studied adaptogenic herb. It is often marketed as Siberian ginseng, and its effect is similar to American ginseng P. quinquefolius and Asian ginseng P. ginseng. It is known as c\u00ec w ji in China and, like Asian ginseng, it is commonly used in TCM to tonify qi. It is also recommended in cases of fatigue, anorexia, poor concentration, and mild depression.[7] As an adaptogen, eleuthero E. senticosus has a lot of uses. Studies have demonstrated that it can stimulate the immune system[8], raise endurance and working capacity, and improve cognitive function[8]; improve mental health and social functioning of older adults and quality of life[9]; and potentially protect against the negative effects of radiation exposure.[10] It may even help reduce the severity of alcohol hangovers. That might be good news if you're someone who likes to ring in the New Year with a glass of champagne! But remember, researchers believe you must consume eleuthero E. senticosus before or right after alcohol consumption for it to be effective.[11] 3. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha W. somnifera is one of the most highly prized herbs in Ayurveda, the traditional Indian healing system. Its name is translated from Sanskrit as \"smell horse,\" implying that taking this herb can help you to become strong as a stallion. In Ayurveda, it is also considered an aphrodisiac and is used with infertility. Interestingly, a recent study showed that it can actually improve sperm quality when given to infertile men.[12] It is commonly marketed as Indian ginseng in the United States. Studies have demonstrated that ashwagandha W. somnifera can help to maintain already healthy levels of blood glucose and cholesterol.[13] Ashwagandha W. somnifera has also been used to help ease anxiety and to helps kids with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).[14] Want to try adaptogenic herbs for athletic performance? Take the next step to learn about herbal formulas. Adaptogenic herbs can bring a lot of benefits on their own. However, they are even more useful when combined with other herbs and supplements. For example, a combination of Asian ginseng P. ginseng and ginkgo Gingko Biloba (L.) is recommended to support brain function.[15] Also, Kan Jang\u00ae, an effective immune support formula, contains eleuthero (Siberian ginseng), elder Sambucus nigra (L.), and creat Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.).[16] When taken to improve sports performance, adaptogenic herbs are usually combined with vitamins and minerals. You can find different commercial formulas in nearly every supplement store. You can also create your own formula to target your needs. You will likely need to review and use monographs that cover therapeutic properties of herbs and supplements. Dietary Supplements by Pamela Mason, Nutraceuticals by Lisa Rapport and Brian Lockwood, and the American Herbal Products Association's Botanical Safety Handbook, edited by Zoe Gardner & Michael McGuffin, are great sources of information. I also highly recommend taking [Sports Nutrition, Herbal Medicine, and Nutrition and Dietary Supplement courses](https://contact.achs.edu/request-information-sports-nutrition) to gain a deeper knowledge of the properties of herbs and supplements and to learn how to safely and effective combine herbs and supplements. {{cta('b06df686-c879-499d-b7aa-ad52b7c2dce9')}} References [1] Yang, J., Huang, H., Zhu, L., & Chen, Y.
