In nearly half of all cases, the person dies. Of those who survive, nearly seven in ten will have some permanent deficit such as cognitive, visual, or speech problems. It is estimated that six million people in the United States \u2014 one in every 50 people, the majority of whom are women \u2014 have an unruptured brain aneurysm. Because most have no symptoms, they have no idea they are harboring a potentially deadly condition. That was the experience of Jess V oskanian, 33, a manager at an educational technology firm who lives in Watertown with her husband and dogs. Fit and seemingly healthy , Ms. V oskanian was cleaning her house last spring when, out of the blue, she was overcome with pain in her head so intense \"it felt like I'd been shot in the head,\" she says. Thankfully , her husband and father-in-law were home and called 911. T aken by ambulance to BIDMC, Ms. V oskanian was soon diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a ruptured brain aneurysm. She was rushed to the OR, where she underwent treatment by neurosurgeon Ajith Thomas, MD, Co-Director of the BIDMC Brain Aneurysm Institute. The Institute is a new program established by neurosurgeon Christopher Ogilvy, MD, Director of the Brain Aneurysm Institute and Endovascular and Operative Neurovascular Surgery in the Department of Surgery . Dr. Ogilvy , one of the world's foremost neurosurgeons who was previously at Massachusetts General Hospital for almost 30 years, came to BIDMC in late 2013 to establish this unique, multidisciplinary Institute. \"We and our patients are very fortunate to have a neurosurgeon of Dr. Ogilvy's experience, talents, and stature leading this new Institute,\" says Ron Alterman, MD, Chief of Neurosurgery .

Weiner Department of Surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for faculty, trainees, staff, alumni, affiliates, and friends. The mission of the Department of Surgery: Provide care of the very highest quality Improve health through innovation and discovery Prepare future leaders in American surgery Serve our communities with sensitivity and compassion Chairman, Surgery Elliot Chaikof, MD, PhD Vice Chairman, Surgery (Communications) Allen Hamdan, MD Editor/Writer Hilary Bennett Contributor Kaitlyn Dmyterko Please forward comments, news items, and requests to be added to or removed from the mailing list to: Editor, Inside Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Department of Surgery, LMOB-9C, 110 Francis MA 02215. E-mail: surgerycommunications@bidmc. harvard.edu Tel: 617-632-9581 bidmc.org/surgeryMessage from the Chairman All meaningful achievements require two essential components \u2014 innovation and teamwork. Without innovation, progress is impossible; without teamwork, even the most promising, bold ideas cannot come to fruition. In this issue, we highlight two BIDMC Institutes that demonstrate the power of innovation and teamwork: the Institute for Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and the new Brain Aneurysm Institute. Each led by a Surgery faculty member but comprising surgeons, physicians, nurses, and many other specialists throughout BIDMC, these multidisciplinary specialty care centers reflect the reality of 21st-century health care \u2014 that to achieve the best possible outcomes, patients with complex, serious conditions like cancer or brain aneurysms require innovative, evidence-based treatment provided by an entire team of specialists working together on their behalf. Indeed, patients who come to these institutes benefit from treatment plans that reflect the combined expertise of specialists in multiple disciplines who are leaders in their fields. They have access to the latest, most promising clinical trials and cutting-edge minimally invasive therapies that, in some cases, are simply not available elsewhere. Most importantly , all receive well-coordinated, compassionate care that reflects BIDMC's \"Human First\" philosophy . The development of innovative, effective new treatments such as those we offer our patients cannot proceed without laboratory and clinical research, which today is increasingly dependent on funding from sources other than the federal government. In this issue, we share the story of a patient who, grateful for the superb care he received from urologist Andrew Wagner, MD, made a generous gift to support Dr. Wagner's prostate cancer research program. Mr. Cotter made an investment in the future by supporting the groundwork needed to benefit subsequent generations of patients. We are all grateful for his and many others' vision, generosity , and support of our mission. This issue features a profile of one of our many accomplished General Surgery Residency Program alumni, Dr. Lorelei Grunwaldt, a pediatric plastic surgeon who heads two major clinical centers at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. It also includes an interview with Dr. Lijun Sun, who leads our new Center for Drug Discovery and Translational Research. A renowned scientist, Dr. Sun has taken multiple small molecules from bench to late-stage clinical trials. I hope you will find this issue of Inside Surgery interesting and informative and, as always, encourage you to contact us with any suggestions or comments.

Harvard Medical School Faculty Promotions Congratulations to the following faculty members on their well-deserved promotions at Harvard Medical School. Continued on page 9 >HOME << | >>bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 4Coiling or clipping One option for the treatment of a brain aneurysm is clipping, a surgical procedure that entails opening the skull (a craniotomy) and placing a titanium clip or clips at the neck of an aneurysm to prevent blood from entering it. In Ms. V oskanian's case, however, open surgery was not necessary . Instead, Dr. Thomas treated her using a minimally invasive (endovascular) approach in which a tiny coil is inserted via a catheter in the groin into the aneurysm. Packing the aneurysm with the coil(s) causes the blood within it to clot, which effectively prevents more blood from entering the aneurysm. Several months later when it was safe to do so, Ms. V oskanian underwent the endovascular placement of a stent, or tiny metal mesh tube, to prevent the coil from migrating out of the aneurysm. Ms. V oskanian suffered no lasting deficits from her ordeal and is back to normal in all dimensions of her professional and personal life, which she credits to her healthy lifestyle and the excellent care she received from Dr. Thomas and the Brain Aneurysm Institute team. Calling her recovery \"miraculous,\" Ms. V oskanian says, \"Dr. Thomas always took time to patiently explain things to me and my family , and would always personally return my calls within minutes. The care he and his team provided were simply spectacular. \" Strength in collaboration Providing optimal care to patients with brain aneurysms or the conditions that can cause them is complex and requires a team approach, says Dr. Ogilvy . He and Dr. Thomas work closely together as members of a multidisciplinary team that also includes fellow neurosurgeon Ekkehard Kasper, MD, PhD, Brain Aneurysm Institute nurse practitioner Deidre Buckley, RN, NP, and a group of BIDMC specialists from a range of disciplines, including of the greatest strengths we offer patients is our truly collaborative team approach,\" says Dr. Ogilvy . \"In our weekly multidisciplinary conference, we draw on the expertise and experience of leading experts across many disciplines to develop a personalized treatment plan that offers each patient the best possible outcomes \u2014 even if that means close observation rather than intervention. \" Adds Dr. Thomas, \"We evaluate all points of view and develop recommendations as a team with the benefit of patients first and foremost in our minds. \" Multiple options In many hospitals, neurosurgeons specializing in neurovascular conditions have expertise in one mode of treatment or the other. But both Drs. Ogilvy and Thomas have extensive experience in both endovascular and open treatment of brain aneurysms, so patients who require intervention are treated using the approach (which sometimes involves a combination Brain Aneurysm Institute Director Christopher Ogilvy, MD, is one of the world's foremost neurosurgeons.< Continued from page 1 A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel ruptures and blood leaks into the surrounding area of the brain. Hemorrhagic StrokeHOME << | >>bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 5of therapies) designed to offer the best possible outcomes. Drs. Ogilvy and Thomas also offer a new flow-diversion treatment (using the Pipeline \u00ae device), which is an option for some patients, including those who were previously considered inoperable. Patients treated at BIDMC also have access to CyberKnife \u00ae, extremely targeted, high-dose radiation therapy that may be used to treat certain vascular malformations. Dr. Kasper is Co-Director of the Keith C. Field CyberKnife Center. The Brain Aneurysm Institute provides evaluation and treatment for a wide range of both ischemic and hemorrhagic neurovascular malformations (A VMs), and cavernous malformations (for a complete list of conditions, please visit the Brain Aneurysm Institute website). Research and education In addition to state-of-the-art care, the Institute also conducts innovative research that spans clinical outcomes studies and basic research. For example, Dr. Ogilvy is conducting clinical research that is evaluating techniques to minimize ischemic injury during neurovascular procedures, and laboratory research that involves using tissue-engineering techniques to treat certain types of aneurysms. Dr. Thomas is looking at how various devices influence the biology of blood vessels and, in collaboration with investigators at Massachusetts Institute of T echnology , using non-invasive methods (transcranial Doppler) to measure pressure inside the brain. The Brain Aneurysm Institute also trains neurosurgical fellows, and is one of only a few programs in the nation offering a truly blended endovascular and surgical experience for fellows. \"Every week, and often every day , I go back and forth between the operating room and endovascular suite, which allows me to use both open and endovascular skills on a frequent basis,\" says Matthew Fusco, MD, a second-year fellow . \"When you also add in the volume, breadth, and collaborative working environment, I don't know of any other program in the country that offers the same opportunity . \" The Institute also offers educational programs for patients and family members. Once a month, for example, patients and those close to them can attend a free educational/support group on topics ranging from \"grieving the loss of self\" to \"new treatments for cerebral aneurysms\" taught by Institute faculty and other experts. In addition, the Institute educates physicians nationally and internationally about neurovascular conditions through invited presentations and symposia. In May , for instance, Institute faculty will present a daylong continuing-education program for physicians, \"Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Update: Current Practices and Future Directions,\" sponsored by Harvard Medical School. As Ms. V oskanian can attest, having a brain aneurysm was a frightening experience. But thanks to the care provided by the Brain Aneurysm Institute's top-notch team of experts, her prognosis is excellent and she feels \"confident, healthy , and ready to face the future. \" Ajith Thomas, MD, treated Jess Voskanian for a brain aneurysm using a minimally invasive approach.

Lucien Capehart Photography Leading neurosurgeons neurologists from BIDMC addressed \"Rethinking the Brain\" at BIDMC's Palm Beach Gala in January . The annual event highlighted the relatively new concept in neuroscience that the adult human brain is adaptable rather than hard-wired and unchangeable. Featured speakers included Ron Alterman, MD, Chief of Neurosurgery (second from left).Distinguished Visiting Professors In February , Julie A. Freischlag, MD, William Stewart Halsted Professor and Chair of the Department of Surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, visited BIDMC as the inaugural William Silen Visiting Professor of Surgery . Dr. Freischlag spoke at Grand Rounds on \"Clinical and Personal Comparative Effectiveness. \" In March, Michael W . Mulholland, MD, PhD, was the Capper-Hermanson Visiting Professor of Surgery . Dr. Mulholland, the Frederick A. Coller Distinguished Professor of Surgery and Chairman of Surgery at the University of Michigan, spoke at Grand Rounds on \"Surgical Research in the Wiki W orld. \" During their two-day visits, Drs. Freischlag and Mulholland participated in roundtable discussions with residents and faculty and were the guests of honor at dinners at the Harvard Faculty Club. Following an on-site review, in January the Trauma Center at BIDMC was re-verified as a Level I Trauma Center by the Committee on Trauma (COT) of the American College of Surgeons. The COT's Consultation/V erification Program for Hospitals promotes the development of trauma centers that provide the entire spectrum of care \u2014 from the pre-hospital phase through rehabilitation \u2014 to address the needs of all injured patients. bidmc.org/surgeryHOME << | >>bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 7Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 7BIDMC Doctors First to Implant Aortic Valve DeviceIn January , BIDMC became the first institution in the nation to treat a patient with a new minimally invasive medical device (CoreValve) following its FDA approval. The device treats patients with severely damaged aortic heart valves who are too ill or frail to have their valves replaced with traditional open-heart surgery . The CoreValve team included cardiac surgeons Kamal Khabbaz, MD, Chief of Cardiac Surgery , and David Liu, MD; interventional cardiologists Jeffrey Popma, MD, Roger Laham, MD, and Duane Pinto, MD; and program coordinator Kim Guibone, NP . Dr. Popma is the co-principal investigator of the national CoreValve U.S. Pivotal Trial, the clinical study that led to FDA approval of the device. Dr. Khabbaz is the co-principal investigator of the local trial, which took place at BIDMC. For more information, contact Ms. Guibone at 617-632-9729. In March, Samuel Lin, MD (left), and Ahmed Ibrahim, MD, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery , and co- corresponding author David Kaplan, PhD, of T ufts University , had a paper published in Nature Communications that describes the results of their ongoing research, which found that screws made of silk could be used to fix broken bones. These biocompatible bone screws may offer many advantages over traditional metal-based ones, including the ability to degrade in the body (thus avoiding the need for a second operation to remove them), and less bone degradation that can result from the differences in mechanical properties of bone and much stiffer metal. Drs. Lin and Kaplan and colleagues synthesized silk bone screws that they implanted into the hind limbs of rats; the screws functioned successfully for the eight-week period investigated, said Dr. Lin, noting that a patent has been filed and that further research is ongoing. Silk from silkworms is the source of biocompatible bone screws.

HOME << | >>Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 10 bidmc.org/surgeryA Conversation with Lijun Sun, PhD Director of the Center for Drug Discovery and Translational Research In September 2012, after 15 very successful years in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry , chemist Lijun Sun, PhD, was recruited to the Department of Surgery to establish and lead the Center for Drug Discovery and Translational Research. By fostering multidisciplinary collaborations throughout the department, BIDMC, Harvard, and industry , the center's goal is to accelerate the translation of basic research into the clinical setting, where it can benefit patients. In this edited interview, Dr. Sun talks about the center, its services and goals, his own research, and what brought him to BIDMC. Q: You were educated in China and later at Georgetown University and then Emory University in Atlanta, where you earned your PhD in Chemistry in 1995. What led you to work in the biopharmaceutical industry focusing on drug discovery and development, versus taking a more traditional route, such as working for a chemical company? A: I'd finished my PhD and learned about a post-doctoral research opportunity in the medical school at Emory that sounded interesting, so I pursued it. At the time I knew very little about biology and it was an eye-opening experience for me to discover that chemistry could make an important contribution to medical research. After two years of post- doctoral research, I left Atlanta for Cambridge, where I worked at Shionogi BioResearch for five years [Director of Chemistry], later moving to Synta Pharmaceuticals for nearly 10 years [Vice President of Chemistry], and then to Theracrine, a biotech startup [Vice President of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences], before coming to BIDMC. During those 15 years, I took on greater responsibilities and participated in the clinical development of a number of first-in-class, novel molecular entities with the potential to treat cancers and autoimmune diseases. I was fortunate to be involved in the entire drug R&D process numerous times, which gave me a unique big-picture perspective that informs my work here at BIDMC. Q: With such a successful track record in industry, why did you choose to change course and come to an academic medical center?A: I believe the best way to discover and develop new drugs that will help patients is to understand the biological targets of those drugs at a deep level. This enables you to design biologically active molecules that take specific aim at those pathways or targets \u2014 to design drugs using a rational approach versus taking a less focused approach. I came to BIDMC because I wanted to collaborate with academic investigators who have this deep understanding so that we could, by combining our complementary skills and knowledge, accelerate their translational research. I also knew that joining the Harvard community of outstanding investigators doing cutting-edge research would present many exciting opportunities for collaboration. Q: In what ways does the center collaborate with investigators, and what are some of the results of those collaborations thus far? A: I'm grateful that I've been very well-received by investigators in the department and at BIDMC, who are HOME << | >>Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 11 bidmc.org/surgerymotivated to accelerate their translational research and welcome the opportunity to take advantage of the resources and skills the center provides. I collaborate with investigators in the development of research proposals, including contributing to study design and identifying future directions. W orking with investigators in Surgery and other departments, for example, we have submitted a number of new grant applications that are under review . We [with Vikas Sukhatme, MD, PhD] recently received a major three-year grant from an international pharmaceutical company to pursue drug design for applications in cancer. We are also working with Surgery investigators Wolfgang Junger, PhD, Elliot Chaikof, MD, PhD, and others to develop drug discovery projects relating to cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, immunology , and nanotechnology . In our current research space, we are building and expanding our capabilities in molecular design, in silico [computer] screening, computational predictive modeling, drug synthesis, and pharmaceutics, all of which will be available to investigators we collaborate with. I currently have three post-docs working with me, but by this summer expect to have five, and I'm developing partnerships with core facilities in the Longwood Medical Area and Harvard University , which will further expand our capabilities. Q: You also conduct your own independent research. What is the focus of those investigations? A: My research involves the natural product migrastatin, which has been shown to prevent cancer metastasis. I hope my research of migrastatin will lead to a better understanding of cancer metastasis, which could help us identify novel treatment and prevention strategies. I am also investigating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is a key player in modulating innate and adaptive immunity . AhR is not well understood, but may be a novel target for treating conditions such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and transplant rejection. We have generated encouraging results from a number of new series of molecules. Q: How will you define success for the center in the short term and the long term? A: In the short term, we want to help generate exciting data so we can sustain ongoing collaborations and, simultaneously , build up the infrastructure of the center so we can be more comprehensive in terms of providing expertise in drug discovery . In the long term, as a result of both our independent and collaborative efforts, we want to discover and develop new pharmaceuticals \u2014 or inspire the discovery of new pharmaceuticals for collaborators in industry to develop \u2014 with the ultimate goal of benefiting patients, which is a goal we all share. Protein co-crystal structures provide templates for computer-aided designs of new inhibitory molecules. The natural product migrastatin has been shown to prevent cancer metastasis.HOME << | >>bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 12Selected Faculty Publications Acute Care Surgery, Trauma, and Surgical Critical Care Junger WG, Rhind SG, promotes apoptosis of neutrophils in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

So when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 59 and told by his Boston urologist that he'd need open surgery within the coming year to treat it, he decided to \"do some homework\" to see what his options were. Based on his research, Mr. Cotter had a list of the three best urologists on the East Coast \u2014 and at the top was Andrew (\"Drew\") Wagner, MD, Chief of Minimally Invasive Urologic Surgery at BIDMC. Mr. Cotter made an appointment to be evaluated by Dr. Wagner and was totally impressed. \"Drew was extremely thorough, which gave me enormous confidence in him, and was widely known for his expertise in minimally invasive prostate surgery , which appealed to me as well,\" says Mr. Cotter, a married father of three adult children who lives with his wife of 40 years, Betsy , in Florida. In September 2012, Dr. Wagner performed a minimally invasive, robotic-assisted prostatectomy on Mr. Cotter. \"I was in the hospital just one night, my recovery was easy , and I had no complications,\" he says. Most importantly , his PSA levels (a potential indicator of prostate cancer) have remained undetectable ever since. Not long after Mr. Cotter's surgery , he and Dr. Wagner met for lunch, during which they discussed Dr. Wagner's ongoing research, which spans investigations of prostate, kidney , and bladder cancer. In particular, they talked about Dr. Wagner's prostate cancer research, which includes the Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study (PASS), the evaluation of quality of life outcomes following robotic versus open surgery , and novel methods to evaluate quality of life following prostate cancer treatment. Understanding that sustaining and expanding this research required immediate funding, the Cotters made a five-year, $100,000 grant to Dr. Wagner. \"My father and father-in-law had prostate cancer, and I have sons, sons-in-law, and recently a new grandson. Not only was this the right thing to do, it was the right thing to do for my family ,\" says Mr. Cotter. \"Drew and his team are doing important work that will have a positive impact on many people's lives, so it's very rewarding to be a resource to them. \" \"Bob's generous gift has been absolutely vital in helping us move our prostate cancer research program forward,\" says Dr. Wagner, noting that the majority of support for salary and supplies for his research team comes from philanthropy . \"We are so grateful to Bob and Betsy for their support and generosity . With their and others' help we can continue to find ways to extend and improve the lives of patients with prostate and other urologic cancers as well as improve teaching and training through our Urologic Fellowship Program. \" To learn more about how you can support research in the Division of Urology, please contact Michele Urbancic, Director of Surgery Development, at murbanci@bidmc.harvard.edu or 617-632-8388.

In addition to the very real risks of delaying potentially life-saving therapies, patients also suffer from the anxiety of waiting for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. The physicians and other care providers of the BIDMC Institute for Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery understand this, and have structured their multidisciplinary program to provide timely , state-of-the-art evaluation and treatment of patients with precancerous or malignant diseases of the pancreas, liver, and bile ducts. \"Our approach is different from the start,\" says Institute Executive Director A. James Moser, MD. \"We have created a specialty care center in which a team of experts works together to provide patients with an integrated approach to care that offers the best opportunity for cure, while supporting our patients and their families at every step of the way . \" Surgical innovation One of the Institute's key strengths is its world-class team of surgical specialists. This includes pancreatic surgeons Mark Callery, MD, Jennifer Tseng, MD, MPH, T ara Kent, MD, MS, and Dr. Moser, as well as liver surgeons Khalid Khwaja, MD, Amy Evenson, MD, and Kristin Raven, MD. These surgeons are members of a larger team that includes the BIDMC Advanced GI Endoscopy group, led by gastroenterologist Ram Chuttani, MD, which is widely known for its expertise in minimally invasive diagnosis and endoscopic treatment. BIDMC medical oncologists and radiation oncologists, as well as experts in pain management, palliative care, radiology , pathology , and genetic counseling, also play key roles in patients' care. The Institute's surgeons are also known nationally for their innovation in surgical technology and the development of clinical decision-making tools. Not infrequently , patients considered \"inoperable\" by physicians at other medical centers come to the Institute and undergo advanced surgical procedures, including resection and reconstruction of the portal vein, with excellent outcomes. The group is particularly known for its expertise in advanced minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery for patients with even the most complex pancreatic and liver conditions, points out Dr. Khwaja. As word has spread about the Institute's combined strengths in innovative surgery and advanced endoscopy , patients are coming from considerable distances for treatment. In fact, the Institute's surgeons now perform the highest volume of minimally invasive hepatobiliary (HPB) surgery in New England. The Institute ensures the best possible outcomes in numerous ways \u2014 by emphasizing proficiency and safety through teamwork and high surgical case volume and, as demonstrated in recent studies Tara Kent, MD (left), and A. James Moser, MD (right), perform a robotic-assisted pancreatic procedure. Institute surgeons are widely known for their expertise in advanced minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery. Assisting with the procedure is surgical resident Jeff Chang, MD.HOME << | >>conducted by senior surgeons Drs. T seng and Callery , by implementing predictive clinical tools that assist caregivers in recommending the best course of action for each patient. A single visit and CareMap Institute patients are seen quickly \u2014 typically the same week they call or are referred. And they are evaluated not over the course of many days or weeks, as is typical in many medical centers, but rather in a single day and in one location. During that one visit, patients are seen by all the appropriate specialists who may play a role in their care, including surgeons, medical oncologists, gastroenterologists, radiation oncologists, genetic counselors, and others. \" At the earliest possible point, we bring everyone into the room who touches the care of the patient,\" says Dr. Kent. The Institute's clinical coordinator, an experienced nurse practitioner, maintains the focus on quality and is the point person for communication with patients and referring physicians. Following each evaluation, patients are given a CareMap, a summary of treatment recommendations from their specialists. They also are shown how to access PatientSite, an online tool developed at BIDMC that provides 24/7 access to their medical records and test results. Each Monday , the entire multidisciplinary team meets to develop comprehensive treatment plans. High accrual to clinical trials In addition to state-of-the-art multidisciplinary evaluation and surgery , patients also benefit from access to BIDMC's technological resources, in particular its high-volume Keith C.

HOME << | >>bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 19ALUMNI SPOTLIGHT Lorelei Grunwaldt, MD, always knew that she wanted to be a doctor. She was inspired by her father, a family practitioner on Shelter Island, a small island off of Long Island with a year-round population of only about 2,000 people. He did everything from deliver babies and suture hunting wounds to perform minor surgery . It was an early lesson in the importance of being nimble when it came to medicine, one that would be reinforced years later when Dr. Grunwaldt entered the surgical training program at BIDMC. Although eventually she would become a pediatric plastic surgeon, she remains grateful for the program's broad-minded approach. \"Training in general surgery rather than specializing right away was one of the most wonderful things that could have happened to me,\" Dr. Grunwaldt says. \"The program at BIDMC helped me learn not only the fundamentals of surgery but also how to take excellent care of patients. \" After graduating from Harvard College and earning her medical degree at Upstate Medical University , Dr. Grunwaldt spent five years in the General Surgery Residency Program at BIDMC. Several mentors stand out in particular, including Christopher Boyd, MD, Jonathan Critchlow, MD, Daniel Jones, MD, and Nicholas T awa, MD, PhD. \"They were all great teachers,\" she says. Dr. Grunwaldt went on to train in plastic surgery at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, and completed a fellowship in craniofacial and pediatric plastic surgery at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, where she continues to practice today . As her career has evolved, Dr. Grunwaldt has focused more on cleft surgery and pediatric plastic surgery , although she continues to perform many types of operations. Currently she directs both the Vascular Anomalies Center and the Brachial Plexus Clinic at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and is an Assistant Professor of Surgery in the Department of Plastic Surgery at UPMC. \"I find plastic surgery rewarding because you can see the difference you are making in a person's life,\" Dr. Grunwaldt says, \"whether it means restoring arm movement to a child who has a brachial plexus injury or repairing disfiguring wounds. \"Recently , for example, she operated on a young boy who was bitten by a dog, losing part of his mouth and cheek. In a two-stage operation, she reconstructed the boy's face and reattached severed facial nerves. Although he will need physical therapy to fully recover, so far his progress has been encouraging. A particularly heart-rending case involved an infant whose penis was accidently severed during circumcision. \"I wasn't sure if I could help this child, but I knew I had to try ,\" Dr. Grunwaldt says. Using microsurgical techniques, she and a team of doctors reattached the severed organ so well that a urologist who examined the baby said it was hard to tell he was ever injured. The pressures of her practice don't leave a lot of free time, but Dr. Grunwaldt still manages to relax. She recalls a visit to a pet store to buy fish because they are low maintenance, only to return home with a puppy , Thelma, who is a bit more demanding but also a lot of fun. Dr. Grunwaldt is also passionate about travel and has visited Africa, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway , Sweden, Hawaii, and Australia. \"I'm so grateful for my residency training at BIDMC,\" Dr. Grunwaldt says. \"I would not be the doctor I am today without that training, which I still draw on all the time. \"Lorelei Grunwaldt, MD \" I'm so grateful for my residency training at BIDMC.

Patients also have access to promising new therapies and clinical trials via the Pancreatic Cancer Research T eam (PCRT) within the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC). PCRT is a non-profit collaborative organization aimed at eradicating and curing pancreatic cancer by translating genomics research into prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. \"Patients with metastatic pancreatic or liver cancers must have access to cutting-edge clinical trials, so the seamless access to novel, promising therapies that we provide is essential,\" says Dr. T seng.Behind the scenes, Institute surgeons such as Dr. Kent also work to develop post-operative care pathways for speedy recovery after a patient returns home. Institute team members also educate health care professionals and patients in the community , and collaborate with philanthropic groups, such as Project Purple, to help raise funds to support research of pancreatic cancer and hepatobiliary diseases. Through all of these innovative clinical, research, and outreach activities, the goal remains the same \u2014 \"to provide better, longer lives for patients with diseases of the pancreas, liver, and bile ducts,\" says Dr. Callery . \"That is why we are here. \" Each Monday, the multidisciplinary Institute team meets to develop comprehensive treatment plans.
