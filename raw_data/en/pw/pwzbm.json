[ HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMISSION] CHAPTER 511. [ LIMITED SERVICES RURAL HOSPITALS] The Executive Commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) proposes new Chapter 511, concerning Limited Services Rural Hospitals, comprising of \u00a7\u00a7511.1 - 511.3, 511.161 - 511.169 in Texas Administrative Code Title 26. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The proposal is necessary to implement Senate Bill (S.B.) 1621, 86th Legislature, Regular Session, 2019, relating to certain rural medical facilities; requiring a license; authorizing fees and taxes, which amends Texas Health and Safety Code (HSC) Chapter 241 by adding Subchapter K, relating to Limited Services Rural Hospital. HSC \u00a7241.302(b), as added by S.B. 1621, requires HHSC to adopt rules to establish the minimum standards for limited services rural hospitals (LSRHs) and to implement licensing standards for LSRHs under HSC \u00a7241.302 if the United States Congress enacts a bill creating a payment program for LSRHs or similarly designated hospitals that becomes law. The federal Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, became law on December 27, 2020, and required the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish a federal rural emergency hospital (REH) designation. CMS adopted federal Conditions of Participation for REHs effective January 1, 2023, and now HHSC must adopt rules as required by HSC Section 241.302(b). Pursuant to Texas Government Code \u00a72005.003, HHSC proposes a 45-day processing timeline for applications to maintain consistency processing timeframes for other acute health care facilities. HHSC is unable to provide the maximum, minimum, and median time frames required by \u00a72005.003(d)(1) because the LSRH licenses are a new licensure type and HHSC currently lacks the data to estimate these statistics.

FISCAL NOTE Trey Wood, HHSC Chief Financial Officer, has determined that for each year of the first five years that the rules will be in effect, there could be an estimated decrease of revenue to state government as a result of enforcing and administering the rules as proposed. Additionally, there is a onetime IT cost to update the Regulatory Automation System (RAS) portal for the new licensure type, but HHSC will absorb the cost using existing resources. Most entities eligible for licensure as an LSRH are currently licensed general or special hospitals. The LSRH fee is a flat $350 fee for the two-year license term versus the general and special hospital fee of $39 per licensed bed per two-year term. This is likely to cause a decrease in revenue. HHSC lacks the ability to estimate this decrease as HHSC is unable to predict how many eligible qualified hospitals will seek licensure as an LSRH. Enforcing or administering the rules does not have foreseeable implications relating to costs or revenues of local government because it is optional for an eligible rural hospital owned or operated by a hospital district, county, or municipality to seek licensure as an LSRH. GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT HHSC has determined that during the first five years that the rules will be in effect: (1) the proposed rules will not create or eliminate a government program; (2) implementation of the proposed rules will not affect the number of HHSC employee positions; (3) implementation of the proposed rules will result in no assumed change in future legislative appropriations; (4) the proposed rules will require a decrease in fees paid to HHSC; (5) the proposed rules will create a new rule; (6) the proposed rules will not expand, limit, or repeal existing rules; (7) the proposed rules will increase the number of individuals subject to the rules; and (8) HHSC has insufficient information to determine the proposed rules' effect on the state's economy. SMALL BUSINESS, MICRO-BUSINESS, AND RURAL COMMUNITY IMPACT ANALYSIS Trey Wood has also determined that there will be no adverse economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities because it is optional for a qualified rural hospital to seek licensure as an LSRH. LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT The proposed rules will not affect a local economy. COSTS TO REGULATED PERSONS Texas Government Code \u00a72001.0045 does not apply to these rules because the rules are necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Texas and are necessary to implement legislation that does not specifically state that \u00a72001.0045 applies to the rules. PUBLIC BENEFIT AND COSTS Stephen Pahl, Deputy Executive Commissioner for Regulatory Services, has determined that for each year of the first five years the rules are in effect, the public benefit will be ensuring continued access to health care services in rural communities. Trey Wood has also determined that for the first five years the rules are in effect, persons who are required to comply with the proposed rules may incur economic costs because a qualified hospital who seeks to become an LSRH must pay a licensing fee of $350 for the two-year licensing term. However, HHSC does not have sufficient information to determine cost to comply because participation is optional. TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT HHSC has determined that the proposal does not restrict or limit an owner's right to an owner's property that would otherwise exist in the absence of government action and, therefore, does not constitute a taking under Texas Government Code \u00a72007.043.

Box 13247, Mail Code 4102, Austin, Texas 78711-3247, or street address 701 W. 51st Street, Austin, Texas 78751; or emailed to HCR_PRU@hhs.texas.gov.

(k) When a visitor to an LSRH is denied in-person visitation with a patient receiving care or treatment at a LSRH because of a determination made by an attending physician under subsection (i) of this section, the LSRH shall: (1) provide each day a written or oral update of the patient's condition to the visitor if the visitor: (A) is authorized by the patient to receive relevant health information regarding the patient; (B) has authority to receive the patient's health information under an advance directive or medical power of attorney; or (C) is otherwise the patient's surrogate decision-maker regarding the patient's health care needs under LSRH policy and other applicable law; and (2) notify the person who receives the daily update required under paragraph (1) of this subsection of the estimated date and time at which the patient will be discharged from the LSRH. \u00a7511.77.Hospital Price Transparency Reporting and Enforcement. (a) A limited services rural hospital (LSRH) shall comply with the disclosure and reporting requirements of Texas Health and Safety Code (HSC) Chapter 327 (relating to Disclosure of Prices) as described in this section. (b) An LSRH shall make the information required by HSC Chapter 327 available in a prominent location on the home page of its publicly accessible website or accessible by selecting a dedicated link that is prominently displayed on the home page of its publicly accessible website. If the LSRH operates multiple locations and maintains a single website, the homepage must contain a link to the list containing the links to each location the LSRH operates in a manner that clearly associates the list with the applicable location of the LSRH. (c) Each time an LSRH updates a list as required by HSC \u00a7327.003 and \u00a7327.004, it shall submit the updated list to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) in the manner specified by HHSC on its website. (d) HHSC has jurisdiction to impose an administrative penalty against a hospital licensed under this chapter for violations of HSC Chapter 327 and this section. An administrative penalty imposed under this section shall be in accordance with the provisions of HSC \u00a7327.008. (e) In determining the amount of any penalty sought pursuant to HSC \u00a7327.008, HHSC shall consider: (1) previous violations by the hospital's operator; (2) the seriousness of the violation; (3) the demonstrated good faith of the hospital's operator; and (4) any other matters that justice may require. (f) For purposes of calculating any penalty sought pursuant to HSC \u00a7327.008, the penalty imposed by HHSC for an LSRH with one of the following total gross revenues, as reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in the year preceding the year in which a penalty is imposed, may not exceed: (1) $10 for each day the hospital violated HSC Chapter 327, if the hospital's total gross revenue is less than $10,000,000; (2) $100 for each day the hospital violated HSC Chapter 327, if the hospital's total gross revenue is $10,000,000 or more and less than $100,000,000; and (3) $1,000 for each day the hospital violated HSC Chapter 327, if the hospital's total gross revenue is $100,000,000 or more. (g) Each day a violation continues is considered a separate violation. (1) The administrative penalties for each day of a continuing violation cease on the date the violation is corrected. A violation that is the subject of a penalty is presumed to continue on each successive day until it is corrected. The date of correction alleged by the hospital in its written plan of correction or corrective action plan will be presumed to be the actual date of correction, unless HHSC later determines that the correction was not made by that date or was not satisfactory. (2) For continuing violations pursuant to HSC Chapter 327, penalties are cumulative as demonstrated in Figure: 26 TAC \u00a7511.77(g)(2)(B). The penalty amount is multiplied by the number of days the violation continues. The penalty amount for each day of the continuing violation is then added to the running total of the previous day's penalties according to the formula in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. (A) Cumulative administrative penalty = [penalty for each day of violation + (penalty for each day of violation x number of days of violation)]/2 x (number of days of violation). (B) The cumulative amounts are not subject to the per day penalty cap in subsection (f) of this section.

(a) All patients have the right to be free from restraint or seclusion, of any form, imposed as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience, or retaliation by staff. Restraint or seclusion may only be imposed to ensure the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others and must be discontinued at the earliest possible time. (b) A limited services rural hospital (LSRH) may only use restraint or seclusion when less restrictive interventions have been determined to be ineffective to protect the patient, a staff member, or others from harm. (c) The type or technique of restraint or seclusion used must be the least restrictive intervention that will be effective to protect the patient, a staff member, or others from harm. (d) The LSRH shall have written policies and procedures regarding the use of restraint and seclusion that are consistent with current standards of practice. (e) An LSRH may only seclude a patient for the management of violent or self-destructive behavior. (f) The patient has the right to safe implementation of restraint or seclusion by trained staff. (1) The LSRH shall provide patient-centered competency-based training and education on the use of restraint and seclusion to LSRH personnel and staff, including medical staff and, as applicable, personnel providing contracted services in the LSRH. (2) The training must include alternatives to the use of restraint or seclusion. (g) An LSRH shall comply with the restraint and seclusion documentation and reporting requirements under Code of Federal Regulations Title 42 \u00a7485.534(g) The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the proposal and found it to be within the state agency's legal authority to adopt.

(p) On suspension, revocation, or non-renewal of the license, the original license shall be returned to HHSC within 30 calendar days of HHSC's notification. (q) One year after HHSC's decision to deny or revoke, or the voluntary surrender of a license by an LSRH while enforcement action is pending, an LSRH may petition HHSC, in writing, for a license. Expiration of a license prior to HHSC's decision becoming final shall not affect the one-year waiting period required before a petition may be submitted. (1) HHSC may allow a reapplication for licensure if there is proof that the reasons for the original action no longer exist. (2) HHSC may deny reapplication for licensure if HHSC determines that: (A) the reasons for the original action continues; (B) the petitioner has failed to offer sufficient proof that conditions have changed; or (C) the petitioner has demonstrated a repeated history of failure to provide patients a safe environment or has violated patient rights. (3) If HHSC allows a reapplication for licensure, the petitioner shall be required to meet the requirements as described in \u00a7511.12 of this chapter (relating to Application and Issuance of Initial License).

ADMINISTRATION AND COMMUNICATION DIVISION 1. [ PERMIT HOLDER RESPONSIBILITIES] The Executive Commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) proposes an amendment to \u00a7746.201, concerning What are my responsibilities as the permit holder. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The purpose of this project is to update a reference to Texas Family Code to correct a typographical error. While the reference was accurately referenced in the proposed version of the rule as published in the September 23, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 6102), the reference in the recently adopted rule was incorrect in that it referenced Texas Family Code \u00a7261.10. This project will correct the reference to \u00a7261.101. SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY The proposed amendment to \u00a7746.201 corrects the reference to the Texas Family Code from \u00a7261.10 to \u00a7261.101. FISCAL NOTE Trey Wood, HHSC Chief Financial Officer, has determined that for each year of the first five years that the rule will be in effect, enforcing or administering the rule does not have foreseeable implications relating to costs or revenues of state or local governments. GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT HHSC has determined that during the first five years that the rule will be in effect: (1) the proposed rule will not create or eliminate a government program; (2) implementation of the proposed rule will not affect the number of HHSC employee positions; (3) implementation of the proposed rule will result in no assumed change in future legislative appropriations; (4) the proposed rule will not affect fees paid to HHSC; (5) the proposed rule will not create a new rule; (6) the proposed rule will not expand, limit, or repeal existing rules; (7) the proposed rule will not change the number of individuals subject to the rule; and (8) the proposed rule will not affect the state's economy. SMALL BUSINESS, MICRO-BUSINESS, AND RURAL COMMUNITY IMPACT ANALYSIS Trey Wood has also determined that there will be no adverse economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities because the amendment just corrects a reference to the Texas Family Code. The rule does not impose any additional costs on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities that are required to comply with the rule. LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT The proposed rule will not affect a local economy. COSTS TO REGULATED PERSONS Texas Government Code \u00a72001.0045 does not apply to this rule because the rule is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Texas and does not impose a cost on regulated persons. PUBLIC BENEFIT AND COSTS Libby Elliott, Deputy Executive Commissioner, Office of Policy and Rules, has determined that for each year of the first five years the rule is in effect, the public will benefit from having an accurate reference regarding the requirements for reporting abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Trey Wood has also determined that for the first five years the rule is in effect, there are no anticipated economic costs to persons who are required to comply with the proposed rule because the amendment only corrects a reference to the Texas Family Code. TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT HHSC has determined that the proposal does not restrict or limit an owner's right to his or her property that would otherwise exist in the absence of government action and, therefore, does not constitute a taking under Texas Government Code \u00a72007.043. PUBLIC COMMENT Written comments on the proposal may be submitted to Rules Coordination Office, P.O. Box 13247, Mail Code 4102, Austin, Texas 78711-3247, or street address 701 W. 51st Street, Austin, Texas 78751; or emailed to HHSRulesCoordinationOffice@hhs.texas.gov.

STATUTORY AUTHORITY The amendment is authorized by Texas Government Code \u00a7531.0055, which provides that the Executive Commissioner of HHSC shall adopt rules for the operation and provision of services by the health and human services agencies, and \u00a7531.02011, which transferred the regulatory functions of the Department of Family and Protective Services to HHSC. In addition, Texas Human Resources Code \u00a742.042(a) requires HHSC to adopt rules to carry out the requirements of Chapter 42 of Texas Human Resources Code.
