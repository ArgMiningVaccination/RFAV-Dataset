The new model for procuring professional veterinary services must allow work to be awarded in a manner which: better demonstrates value for money; offers greater assurance of the quality of the service performed; and is fully compliant with laws governing public procurement. The new approach, which will replace the existing Memorandum of Conditions of Appointment with the BVA, will allow quality assurance standards to be enforced through a legally binding contract. To demonstrate value for money and comply with the law, such contracts can only be awarded following open and fair competition. The details of how work will be allocated have yet to be decided. All potential models for provision of OV services will be considered with care following an analysis of the market place which may supply these services. The tendering decision will be of close interest for many with business plans built on the assumption of the ongoing receipt of OV fees. Animal Health's relationship with OVs is highly valued and consideration will be given as to how any concerns they have can be mitigated or managed. It is important that existing practices, and other small and medium sized enterprises, are not disadvantaged through a lack of commercial tendering experience. For this reason, Animal Health is considering a series of regional workshops at which the tendering process will be explained and guidance provided. Approaches from the veterinary profession that help to refine the new process of procurement are welcomed. OVs with any suggestions or recommendations are asked to pass these to Animal Health via: Janet Taylor - Janet.taylor@animalhealth.gsi.gov.ukC11, Government Buildings, Whittington Road,Worcester WR5 2LQPage 2 Impact of reduced public finances Page 3 New ways of working Page 4 New Horizons conference Page 5 New powers for Animal Health Pages 6-7 TB in Wales Pages 8-9 TB in England Page 10 More support to farmers Page 11 Bluetongue: new import rules Page 12 New and emerging diseaseNews OVs will be aware that public finances are under great strain. In addition to our regular efficiency savings targets, Animal Health has been told to make an additional \u00a37m of savings this year. This is part of Defra's overall budget reduction of \u00a3162m, and represents the agency's share of the government's overall \u00a36.2bn debt reduction programme for 2010-11. During the financial year 2010-11, Animal Health will be expected to make overall savings of \u00a315m (before the new budgetary constraints were announced we had been expected to make \u00a38m of savings). This will require the agency to look ever more critically at what it does and how it operates. In the last few years we have looked hard at ways to deliver our services in the most efficient way possible; concentrating resources on field activities, including those performed on our behalf by OVs. This will remain a priority. Our Business Reform Programme (see next page) has been changing the way Animal Health operates, moving us away from paper-based processes towards electronic systems. We are also continuing to centralise more administrative functions in national Specialist Service Centres rather than duplicate them in local offices. Although useful, these measures alone are insufficient to meet the financial challenges facing us. For this reason some work traditionally performed by Animal Health staff, but moved to OVs as we took on other duties, will be brought back in-house. Due to financial constraints this will be the last edition of the Official Veterinarian newsletter to be printed and distributed. Following the distribution of this edition, information and news relevant to the work of Official Veterinarians will be placed on the Animal Health website, www.defra.gov.uk/animalhealth The website is currently being updated with more and better content, and in future it will provide a more comprehensive source of quality information, training, advice and guidance. A new structure and improved navigation will make it much easier for OVs to access the information they need and to keep abreast of changes to legislation and working practices. It is intended that the newsletter will continue in softcopy format and will in future be emailed to practices.From early August 2010 all tracing administration work undertaken by Animal Health has begun to be transferred to a new Specialist Service Centre (SSC) in Cardiff. This will not affect the work carried out by OVs on behalf of Animal Health. When carrying out a tracing test, OVs will receive the BT4 'Request for test to be carried out' directly from the Cardiff SSC. Despite this change, OVs should continue to return completed test charts to their local Animal Health office, which will remain the OV contact for queries regarding tracing tests. Charts for animals that have been tested as a result of a tracing test request should be highlighted on the TB52A form. The following should also be written across the top of the TB52 form: 'TRACING ANIMALS INCLUDED'. This will enable the local Animal Health office to process these charts in priority order Impact of reduced public financeLast Official Veterinarian newsletterTracings centralisationAnimal Health to merge with Veterinary Laboratories Agency Animal Health is to merge with the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) Defra announced on 29 June 2010. Bringing together the two organisations, which share the core goals of protecting public and animal health, will enable better use of resources and expertise. In particular, it will improve resilience and create a strong organisation that provides a range of services - from on-farm advice and emergency response, to the world-class laboratory work and science for which the VLA is recognised. While this decision is driven by the considerable match between the roles of the two agencies in combating animal diseases, costs savings can also be expected as a result of consolidating some overlapping roles. The full impact of this decision is not yet clear, but work will begin to merge the two agencies following the completion of Defra's science review. It should be noted that in Scotland the VLA currently operates only one site, VLA Lasswade, with most laboratory work being performed by Scottish Agricultural College's (SAC) Veterinary Division. The merger will not affect these laboratories, which continue to be run separately by SAC. See page 4 for details of the VLA's New Horizons Conference to which OVs are invited. 2 OV ISSUE 7 SEPTEMBER 2010OV ISSUE 7 SEPTEMBER 2010 3 News New ways of working - managing TB test data During the first half of 2011 the way Animal Health and OVs manage TB test data will change. From this time OVs performing TB testing will be able to enter data directly onto Animal Health's core IT-system (known as Sam), making the process quicker and more efficient. Once logged on to Sam OVs will be able to enter 'Test Arranged' dates directly on to the system. Animal Health will inform the relevant paying agency of these dates. OVs will also be able to pre-populate the test data form with customer and animal ID details and, if they wish, download the form for use off-line. When they have carried out a TB test, OVs will be able to submit test data to Animal Health in one of three ways: by entering test data directly into Sam; by entering test results onto a test data form (off-line) and uploading this form; or by uploading test data from another IT application. Data validation will be carried out when data is entered on Sam or a form is uploaded onto the system. If an error or omission is identified, an on-line message will provide the user with guidance on what steps need to be taken. Once validated and accepted onto Sam the data will be used to update the 'test history' at herd and animal level. There will be no requirement for OVs to submit paper forms to Animal Health. Why is Animal Health introducing these changes? The changes will: improve speed and quality - by reducing the time required to enter test results and to remove infected animals; improve efficiency - by reducing manual and duplicate data entry, by automating processes and by reorganising the work that cannot be automated; improve processes - by providing better management information. What are the benefits for OVs? The new system will benefit OVs in a number of ways. These benefits include: improved access to work lists; improved off-line working capability; reduced time to input test results; simplified arrangements for notifying the 'Test Arranged' date to paying agencies; improved speed of results submission to Animal Health; reduced use and handling of paper; charts (visits) will be paid more promptly and will not get lost in the post. We are also looking at ways to improve OVs' access to relevant animal and herd level testing data. How will Animal Health prepare OVs for the forthcoming changes? The update to the Sam system is planned for early 2011, and detailed planning for introducing the update is at an early stage. At present we cannot be specific about the range of training and support that will be made available. However, we will keep OVs updated through our website, via networking arrangements in place at local, regional and national levels, and through the BVA. Who can I contact to find out more about these changes? Rachel Nixon,Block C Government Buildings, Telephone: 763355 e-mail: of OV appointments was centralised to a dedicated team at Worcester. The administration of OV training is due to be centralised to the same team this year, making one central point of contact for all OV appointment and training administration matters. The process of centralising the work from Animal Health offices will be undertaken on a phased basis, starting on 16 August and concluding on 11 October 2010. A flyer will be despatched to all practices notifying them when the Specialist Service Centre will become their new contact point for OV training matters, and providing further details. Queries about the centralisation project should be addressed to the Specialist Service Centre in Worcester via ovteam@animalhealth.gsi.gov.uk or 01905 768725. Centralisation of OV training Holdings (CPH) Programme New Horizons conferenceAnimal Health's Livestock Partnership has secured funding from Defra's Food and Farming Group (FFG) to progress specific components of the County Parish Holdings (CPH) Programme. The programme is currently reviewing which areas should be addressed as a priority within the available resources. Proposals under consideration include: whether to implement the extended use of isolation facilities; what action should be taken to mitigate the risks posed by BCMS (Bovine Cattle Movement Service) links and Sole Occupancy Authorities (SOAs); potential improvements to business processes and business rules for issuing new CPHs; delivery of an initial, static, integrated view of livestock keeper and land information for Great Britain, with further consideration being given to a regularly updated view. It is likely these proposals will need to be delivered as part of a package in order for the full benefits to be realised. Pig Movements Project Alongside its CPH Programme work, the Livestock Partnership has also been successful in securing funding from Defra to deliver the Pig Movements project. This project is designed to improve the accuracy of pig movement data and the speed of data delivery. It is also examining ways to reduce administrative burdens on industry and government. Work is currently underway to deliver 100% of farm- to-slaughter movements electronically by March 2011. The target for completion of reporting other movements electronically is August 2011. The project will ultimately deliver electronic reporting of 100% of pre-validated pig movements in England and Wales into the Animal Movements Licensing System (AMLS). The Pig Movements project carries on from a successful trial begun in March 2010 by the British Pig Executive (BPEX) and the Livestock Partnership. This trial enabled a selection of pig producers to submit combined movement (AML2) and Food Chain Information (FCI) data electronically. The trial demonstrated tangible benefits to both producers and local authorities, and all parties recognised benefits and improved productivity. The New Horizons Conference is a national event organised by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), the Government Veterinary Surgeons (GVS) and the Association of Government Veterinarians (AGV). The event provides a unique opportunity for professionals in the veterinary field to interact and discuss areas of mutual interest. Around 300 delegates are expected to attend from the commercial and public sector, and Official Veterinarians are welcome to register at the public sector rate. The conference will be held at the University of Warwick, near Coventry, between 22-24 September 2010. Topics will include: antimicrobial resistance (organised jointly with the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy); surveillance; food-borne zoonoses (organised jointly with the Food Standards Agency and the Department of Health); animal health and welfare; infection management (organised jointly with the VMD); case reviews; new diagnostic technology and connectivity (organised jointly with the Technology Strategy Board).

Under the new powers producers marketing eggs as class A, who have failed to comply with the Salmonella National Control Programme's testing requirements, may, for the first time, receive a penalty notice (a fine) from Animal Health, without the need to go to court. The aim of the regulations is to prevent eggs from hens of unknown or infected status being classified and entering the market as Class A. The enforcement powers are applicable to all commercial flocks in England and Wales of 350 or more laying hens. They also apply to some smaller commercial flocks. Penalties will vary, depending on circumstances, from \u00a3100 to \u00a34500. The introduction of variable penalty notices does not replace the existing penalties available through criminal prosecution. Animal Health will still be able to prosecute non-compliant operators in appropriate cases. These new powers do not replace those provided by the Zoonoses Order 1989 and the Control of Salmonella in Poultry Order 2009, which enable the restriction of premises and collection of official samples when considered appropriate. There are no changes to existing testing requirements. The new powers add to those already in place for enforcing compliance with the National Control Programme.New enforcement powers for Animal HealthNews in brief National foot-and-mouth exercise OVs warned not to 'forward' testDuring November 2010 Animal Health will be running exercise 'Silver Birch', a major national exercise designed to test Britain's ability to deal with a significant outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The exercise, which Animal Health has organised in conjunction with Defra, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Assembly Government, will simulate a significant foot and mouth outbreak and test participants' existing plans and policies for controlling and eradicating exotic notifiable diseases. The EU requires Member States to exercise their foot-and-mouth disease contingency plans twice within a five year period, or during 'the five year period after the outbreak of a major epizootic disease has been effectively controlled and eradicated'. In preparation for 'Silver Birch', which takes place over two days from 9-10 November, Animal Health has already run the first of two tabletop exercises that will provide background material. The June tabletop comprised a series of strategic meetings that took place in real time, with briefing and scenario information periodically provided by controlled 'players' to stimulate discussion and provoke responses from participants. It covered the suspicion phase of a foot and mouth breakdown, the imposition of a temporary control zone, the confirmation of disease, the declaration of a protection and surveillance zone, and the introduction of a national movement ban. The scenario used involved a mixed cattle, sheep and pig commercial farm in the Yorkshire and Humber region. The second tabletop excise takes place on 5 October, with the findings from both events going forward to the main Silver Birch exercise. For the main exercise a National Disease Control Centre (NDCC) and multiple Local Disease Control Centres (LDCCs) will be established - as they would be in the event of a real, major disease outbreak. In addition, a Disease Strategy Group (DSG) will be set up in Edinburgh, and an Emergency Coordination Centre (Wales) (ECC (W)) in Cardiff. Objectives have been established to determine the success of exercise 'Silver Birch', and an evaluation report will be published in early 2011. Some OVs are bringing forward scheduled bTB tests by a number of months, negating our requirement to undertake these tests at regular intervals. Please ensure the tests are carried out within a couple of weeks of the scheduled date and no sooner or later. If this continues, we may be forced have to introduce a payment system where only tests scheduled for a given period will be paid.The Tuberculosis (Wales) Order 2010 came into force on 25 May 2010. This introduces a number of changes to current practice. The main ones are highlighted below. The power to slaughter untested animalsWhen a livestock keeper has failed to comply with testing requirements relating to their animals, and Animal Health has not been able to test them because it has not been practicable to do so, the cattle will be treated as being affected with tuberculosis for the purposes of section 32 of the Animal Health Act 1981. Under previous legislation cattle that could not be tested for bovine TB (because of their wild nature, for example) might have remained on the livestock keeper's premises, presenting a disease transmission risk. The new Order allows the Welsh Assembly Government to arrange for the slaughter of such animals on-farm, thereby removing the potential source of disease transmission. Compensation paid in this situation will be affected by rules around overdue testing and any enforcement action associated with illegal activities.Veterinary Improvement Notice The new order also introduced the concept of Veterinary Improvement Notices to reinforce the eradication of TB by requiring good working practice and on-farm facilities management. It is not anticipated that Veterinary Improvement Notices will be issued often, but they will be used where continuing bad practice or lack of action by a cattle keeper may be having an impact on the level or duration of TB infection on a holding. The notices are currently being developed. Information about Veterinary Improvement Notices, including the type of situations where they will be issued, will be sent to all cattle keepers prior to their issue. Compensation for reactor/infected cattleThe value of compensation payable in respect of an animal slaughtered due to bovine TB is now calculated in accordance with the Schedule to the 2010 Order. This is subject to an animal being properly identifiable by means of ear tags and a cattle passport - in accordance with the requirements of the Cattle Identification (Wales) Regulations 2007.TB (Wales) Order 2010Changes to TB Policy in Wales 6 OV ISSUE 7 SEPTEMBER 2010OV ISSUE 7 SEPTEMBER 2010 7 Changes to TB Policy in Wales The Order provides a new method of calculating levels of compensation which allows for valuations to be lowered if there has been poor practice and/or non-compliance with bovine TB testing requirements on the part of the cattle keeper. The value of an animal slaughtered will be calculated using the following formula: A x B = C Where: A is the market value of the animalB is the figure provided in the Schedule to the Tuberculosis (Wales) Order 2010, by which value is calculated in cases of poor practice and breaches of obligation with regards to Veterinary Improvement Notices, breaches of obligations (illegal activities), and overdue testing. C is the value of the animal for the purposes of the Order (i.e. the payment of compensation in respect of that animal). An appeal process is in place and will ensure that compensation paid is appropriate. If you have any questions regarding the calculation of compensation under the new Order then contact the Welsh Assembly Government TB Helpline on 0800 5283300. Pre-Movement TestingA review of pre-movement testing policy suggested that some of the existing testing exemptions should be changed to reduce the risk of spreading bovine TB. The general rule is that cattle owners in Wales should test their cattle before they move. Under the 2010 Order the following exemptions no longer apply: cattle moving off premises within 30 days of arrival; cattle moving to housed shows or ones that last more than 24 hours. This means that a pre-movement test will now be required for cattle: moving to housed shows and those lasting over 24 hours in Wales; moving from Wales to housed shows and those lasting over 24 hours in other parts of Great Britain. The following exemptions remain within the legislation: cattle owners do not need to test cattle that are less than 42 days old at the date of the movement; cattle moving to get veterinary treatment, provided the animals are returned direct to their original premises after treatment, are killed, or go direct to slaughter; any movement approved by Welsh Ministers on behalf of the Welsh Assembly Government. This would only be used in extreme circumstances or occasionally in unforeseen circumstances. The Presentation of Cattle for Removal to Slaughter The Tuberculosis (Wales) Order 2006 required cattle keepers to present their cattle to an inspector for testing and valuation. However, they were not required to present cattle when it came to their removal for slaughter. The 2010 Order introduces the requirement to present cattle for removal to slaughter, as well as for testing and valuation. The Intensive Action Pilot Area Cattle keepers in the Intensive Action Pilot Area will be receiving an information pack about measures coming into force in that area that are in addition to those listed above. Further information on the Wales Bovine TB Eradication Programme and details of the new legislation are available on the Welsh Assembly Government website: wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/ahw/ disease/bovinetuberculosis/?lang=en Animal Health has revised the 'TB in your Herd' publication. You can download leaflets from the Animal Health website www.defra.gov.uk/animalhealth/Wildlife Control As part of a package of measures, Defra has committed to the introduction of a carefully- managed and science-led policy of badger control in areas with high and persistent levels of bovine TB in England. Defra will be considering all the issues carefully, including the scientific evidence, to work out the detail of the package. Vaccine and culling options will be looked at as part of the package. Vaccination Ministers have reviewed the Badger Vaccine Deployment Project (BVDP), which would have seen the trapping and vaccination of badgers in areas of Staffordshire, Herefordshire/Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Devon this summer. Following their review, it has been decided to proceed with only one area (near Stroud in Gloucestershire). This reflects both the changed policy position and the need to consider carefully all public expenditure. Vaccination began near Stroud on 5 July and will continue throughout summer and autumn and be repeated for five years. Badger sett surveys will also be completed in an area near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, since this work was already well under way at the time of the election. At the site near Stroud, the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) will trap and vaccinate badgers using the recently-licensed injectable badger BCG vaccine on up to 100km2 of cattle land. Fera will also offer training to lay vaccinators to help build capacity. Landowner participation in the Stroud and Cheltenham project areas remains voluntary, and all landowners who have applied to take part in the project are being contacted to explain the recent changes and what they mean for them. Over the coming months Defra will be actively considering other options for how vaccination might be deployed more widely as part of a badger control policy. Details of the trapping and vaccination training course will be available in due course on the Fera website, www.fera.defra.gov.uk.TB in England Changes to TB Policy in England Bovine TB Low Incidence Areas 8 OV ISSUE 7 SEPTEMBER 2010East of England Before 2006 the number of bTB incidents occurring in the East of England region each year was very low (typically in single figures). The breakdowns that did occur were predominantly related to beef animals brought into the region for finishing. Four years on, breakdowns remain low in comparison with high incidence areas of the country (there were around 20 breakdowns in 2009). However, every year has seen a steady increase in numbers. Most of the new breakdowns originated in the north of the region, in Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, but incidents have since occurred in Essex, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. This distribution of bTB incidents reflects cattle populations, with the disease first appearing in areas of highest cattle density. To date, all incidents have been linked to the movement of cattle but more of these cases are being identified by routine herd tests. Following a meeting with NFU to discuss bTB in 2009, Animal Health assisted in the production of an article in the NFU'smagazine. The article described ideas for best practice aimed at stopping the disease from becoming established in the East of England region. Since then, Animal Health in the region has stepped up its efforts to raise awareness amongst OVs, farmers and livestock keepers. Three regional OV meetings for practices involved in TB testing have been held, and followed up with meetings for farmers. In collaboration with the National Animal Disease Information Service (NADIS) and a project funded by the East of England Development Agency, Animal Health is supporting the development of a bTB module that will be delivered by OVs to their farming clients during autumn 2010. The messages delivered to OVs and farmers have been on the following themes: 1. The current disease situation 2. Detection and prevention of bTB 3. Reactors - what happens next? 4. The TB test.News in Brief: England OV ISSUE 7 SEPTEMBER 2010 9South East of England Although a Low Incidence Area (LIA), the South East region has been divided into three distinct bTB 'risk areas'. The counties bordering infected areas in the west (Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Hampshire) are considered to be at intermediate risk, in these counties the incidence of bTB is slightly higher than in lower risk counties further east where the disease only occurs sporadically. Because of this, in counties at intermediate risk a two parish wide two-year testing buffer zone has been created adjacent to all one-year testing parishes. The South East also has a single own endemic 'enclave' of bTB, with its own local spoligotype of Mycobacterium bovis, in the East Sussex South Downs. This area aside, the majority of new bTB breakdowns in the South East can be traced back to cattle movements from infected areas or from breakdown herds outside the region. Over the past 18 months, Animal Health has been actively engaged in a 'Keep TB out of the South East' campaign with the Regional Animal Health and Welfare Group and the regional NFU. As part of this campaign, four regional OV meetings for practices involved in TB-testing were organised. These were followed by a number of practice meetings for clients and/or OVs. Together with the regional NFU, Animal Health in the South East organised and participated in 16 farmer meetings across the region, to discuss bTB prevention. To improve the understanding of bTB biosecurity both among farmers and vets, Animal Health (jointly with the regional EBLEX and large animal practices) was also involved in developing the first standards for a farm-based health assurance scheme for bTB as part of the LASER-initiative. To support the bTB campaign in the South East, Animal Health has targeted two areas within the region. The first of these is the New Forest, the largest common land area in England on which approximately 3,000 cattle graze - some all year round. The common currently stretches across one, two and four-year testing parishes and cattle move across it frequently. Together with the Forest Verderers Association, Animal Health decided to implement a one-year herd testing interval on all herds using the common in the hope this would prevent gradual spread of bTB across the Forest. This initiative was welcomed by the majority of livestock keepers, and was launched in February 2010. The second area targeted by Animal Health is the East Sussex infected enclave. In this location the regional NFU and Animal Health have initiated a badger biosecurity campaign. The campaign mirrors a similar initiative in East Midlands where farmers are trained by experts to identify badger activity on their farm and develop farm-specific biosecurity measures to avoid badger-cattle contact. TB in England More support for farmers with TB in their herd OVs in England are being offered the opportunity to receive training as bTB specialist advisors for their clients, under a programme being funded by Defra. The Farmer Advice Project was established in 2009 after the TB Eradication Group in England (TBEG) raised the importance of providing enhanced support to TB affected farm businesses in the form of professional biosecurity, veterinary and business advice. The initiative is aimed at livestock owners experiencing their first bTB breakdown and those under long-term restrictions. As part of the Farmer Advice Project two pilot biosecurity events, based on the latest scientific evidence, were held on farms earlier this year. These aimed to provide livestock keepers with the necessary information for reducing bTB transmission risks between cattle, and from wildlife to cattle. Working in partnership with industry representatives, this element of the advice project is currently being refined by Defra and Animal Health ahead of wider roll-out later this year. Farmers will be able to access free business advice, helping them minimise the business impacts of TB breakdowns, through the Farm Crisis Network (FCN). The FCN, a charity providing practical and pastoral help to farmers, was identified by TBEG as having the appropriate background, experience, and industry trust to provide advice and, where necessary, to sign-post businesses to sources of other more specialist advice and support.Through its use of extended disease investigation visits, Animal Health has been delivering enhanced veterinary advice for first-time TB breakdowns since January 2010. The second stage of this process involves working with the profession to deliver enhanced private veterinary support - a key source of advice for cattle farmers. Two approaches are currently being piloted: Joint bTB meetings for private vets and their farming clients. The first of these events was held in the East Midlands in July 2010. A second meeting is scheduled to take place in the West Midlands later this year. Inviting practices to nominate a vet to be trained as bTB 'specialist'. Nominated vets will receive free CPD training so they can act as a bTB advisor for their clients and liaise with Animal Health on specific cases. A comprehensive training package is being developed, with the first training session scheduled for autumn 2010. Taking advantage of an existing Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) funded project which aims to deliver 2,000 herd health plans in the North West region, Defra is funding additional one-off bTB training for vets signed up to deliver the plans. Once trained, these TB 'specialist' vets will be able to promote on farm biosecurity to prevent bTB, and incorporate farm specific risk reduction measures into disease prevention plans. 10 OV ISSUE 7 SEPTEMBER 2010 Bluetongue import restrictions Greater controls on imported livestock to help reduce risk of bluetongue The status of BTV8 Protection Zones (PZ) across Great Britain changed on 12 June 2010 to BTV8 Lower Risk Zones (LRZ). This change has resulted in more stringent conditions for animals being moved into Great Britain. Previously, free movement had been allowed for animals coming into the country from other BTV8 PZs, but this has altered as a result of the LRZ being in place. From 12 June 2010, movements of animals from BTV8 zones into Great Britain need to be made under full 'Annex III conditions'* unless the moves are direct to slaughter. The conditions require that only animals which have been vaccinated with an approved vaccine, or that have natural immunity, are allowed to be imported. Animals are not accepted from environments which provide vector free or vector proof conditions. Currently available bluetongue vaccines are only authorised for use in cattle and sheep. UK policy remains that bluetongue susceptible species, other than cattle and sheep, that have been vaccinated without the manufacturer's marketing authorisation (i.e. under the cascade system) may not be imported.For bovine and ovine animals the most common conditions for moves into Great Britain are expected to be: vaccination with an approved vaccine, plus a 60 day wait; vaccination with an approved vaccine, plus an agent identification test 14 days after onset of immunity; booster vaccination within time period of immunity. Movements of animals into Great Britain from zones for serotypes other than BTV8 have always been required to meet the Annex III conditions and this will continue. Bluetongue post-import testing requirements for BTV susceptible animals will remain unchanged for the time being.Despite the recent changes livestock keepers should continue to vaccinate their animals against BTV8.

Please refer to the following link for more information: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/ LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CON SLEG:2007R1266:20091201:EN:PDF OV ISSUE 7 SEPTEMBER 2010 11 New diseases New and emerging disease threats In recent years considerable attention has been focussed on a number of high profile 'new and emerging' diseases such as bluetongue in northern Europe and H1N1 influenza in humans and pigs. While it has been correct to concentrate on these diseases, it is also important for OVs to be aware of a number of other less high profile disease conditions that also pose a threat to livestock in Great Britain. This article features two of these lesser known diseases: psoroptic mange in cattle cattleCases of psoroptic mange continue to be diagnosed by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) since the detection of a case in South Wales in October 2007 (the first in Great Britain since 1983). Significant concerns remain that the condition, originally thought to have been re-introduced to Great Britain via cattle imported from elsewhere in Europe, may continue to spread across wider geographical areas and become endemic. Psoroptic mange can cause severe clinical signs in affected cattle, leading to potentially significant adverse welfare effects and production losses. There may be a considerable delay between the onset of infestation and the development of clinical signs, especially as the mites associated with the disease may become quiescent during the summer months. Additionally, there have been reports that several confirmed cases have failed to respond to certain available licensed treatments, such as macrocyclic lactones and synthetic pyrethroids. There is no link with Psoroptes ovis (sheep scab) cases. An information sheet providing further details about psoroptic mange in cattle (including photos of clinical signs) is available on the VLA website at: www.defra.gov.uk/vla/diseases/docs/dis_psoroptic.pdf Correct diagnosis with laboratory confirmation is essential. Contact your VLA regional laboratory or SAC disease surveillance centre for further advice. Submission forms for the VLA and SAC may be found at the following addresses: www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/docs/ forms/VLA/vla3.pdf www.sac.ac.uk/mainrep/pdfs/ farmanimalservicessubmission.pdf Bovine Besnoitiosis Bovine besnoitiosis is a disease of cattle caused by a protozoan organism called Besnoitia besnoiti which can present clinically with both systemic and cutaneous signs. The disease is widely distributed throughout Africa. Bovine besnoitiosis has recently been classed as an emerging disease in western and central Europe due to an increase in reported cases and a geographic expansion of the disease in cattle herds. The disease has been present in some parts of France, Spain and Portugal for many years. More recently, it was confirmed in a beef herd in Germany after cattle were imported from France. The disease has not yet been identified in Great Britain. However, there is a possibility it could be imported via live cattle from affected areas. An information sheet providing a summary of the clinical signs of bovine besnoitiosis (including photos of clinical signs), and the diagnostic approach to suspect cases is available on the VLA website at: www.defra.gov.uk/vla/diseases/docs/dis_besnoitiosis.pdf A more in-depth review of the disease is available in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) journal at: www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/1499.pdf You are urged to consider bovine besnoitiosis as a potential differential diagnosis in cases with appropriate clinical signs, especially in imported animals. Surveillance and reporting suspect cases Neither psoroptic mange in cattle or bovine besnoitiosis are statutorily notifiable or reportable diseases. However, in order to assist in Great Britain-wide surveillance for the emergence or spread of these conditions colleagues are requested to report any suspected cases to a Veterinary Investigation Officer (VIO) at your local VLA regional laboratory or SAC disease surveillance centre. VIOs will be happy to offer further guidance and advice as required. "}
