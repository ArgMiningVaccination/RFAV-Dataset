Wimmer, PhD Excellence in Research George Fitchett, DMin, PhD Barbara Swanson, PhD, RN, FAAN, ACRN Back to table of contents.Michael A. Hanak, MD, FAAFP Michael A. Hanak, MD, FAAFP, is an associate professor and vice chairperson for Clinical Programs in the Department of Family Medicine. Hanak, who has a five-year history at Rush, began as a patient safety officer for the Department of Family Medicine in 2014. He then chaired and co-chaired Rush University Medical Group's Quality Committee, where he helped craft a population health strategy and identify opportunities to improve the health care delivered to patients. This led to his appointment as neighborhood medical director for Rush Health and a seat on the quality management subcommittee. He also established the Rush Center for Preoperative Care, reducing the rate of same-day surgical cancellations from 7 percent to 0.6 percent among those seen in the clinic. Steven Rothschild, MD, a professor in the Department of Family Medicine as well as Hanak's chair and nominator, says, \"He is constantly asking how our system can be improved and then taking action.\" Hanak led a $1.8 million grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a site participant in the Transforming Clinical Practice Initiative, which is aimed at practice transformation and sustainable change supporting high quality care. This drove the creation of the Ambulatory Quality Team, a performance improvement group that has led the way in best practices and quality improvement interventions across primary care and other clinical service lines. The team allowed Rush University Medical Group to achieve top decile performance on four key clinical quality measures through payer-sponsored incentive programs in 2018. Rush University Medical Group achieved new highs in rates of breast cancer screening (76 percent up to 81 percent) and colon cancer screening (64 percent up to 70 percent) all while sustaining three consecutive years of top-decile hypertension control rates (75 percent or higher) using a hypertension management toolkit that he developed, which led to Rush being recognized by the American Heart Association in its \"Million Hearts Campaign.\" The Quality Team also led Rush's involvement in the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Pursuing Equity Initiative, a two-year national collaborative of leading health centers aimed at creating and sustaining equitable health systems. Hanak joined the Information Systems infrastructure as a physician informaticist and worked to become an associate chief medical informatics officer in the newly restructured clinical informatics team. He served as a presenter before a panel of judges visiting Rush from Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, which later granted Rush stage 7 recognition for optimizing and advancing the adoption of its ambulatory health record. Hanak has also worked to reduce opioid prescribing at Rush and served as the project lead for directly connecting Rush's Epic EMR to the Illinois state Prescription Monitoring Program. His quality and safety efforts are always applied with an equity lens. He currently serves as vice president of the Illinois Academy of Family Physicians and last year became vice chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians Delegation to the American Medical Association. Excellence in Clinical ServiceFaculty Recognition RECEPTION 5Back to table of contents.Kristin J. Al-Ghoul, PhD Kristin J. Al-Ghoul, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Cell and Molecular Medicine, began teaching histology in 1999, lecturing about functional cell biology at the Graduate College in 2004, and became a co-course director in the school's Biotechnology Program in 2007. She is currently the histology discipline director for Rush Medical College among other teaching and administrative responsibilities. As a junior faculty member, Al-Ghoul noticed that many medical students arrived at histology lab sessions unprepared. She partnered with another faculty member to create laboratory preview presentations. These previews have been refined and updated since their inception and are now considered an indispensable tool. As the histology discipline director in the Medical College's block curriculum, she has been responsible for all of the histology content, including much of the didactic material, the laboratory guides and lab previews. With the introduction of case-based learning, she piloted numerous basic-science correlation presentations to align with clinical cases. She has been involved with creating session activities, study questions and assessment vignettes for histology content in the case sessions for the single-pass curriculum. These sessions utilize active-learning strategies that emphasize analysis and application. Al-Ghoul is consistently rated as being an \"effective teacher\" by 95 percent or more of the students in her Rush Medical College evaluations. She is a member of the Rush Medical College pre-clerkship workgroup of the Committee on Curriculum and Evaluation, and during the planning phase of the single-pass curriculum was a member of the Learning Objectives Subcommittee within the Curriculum Integration-Educational Design Committee. Al-Ghoul has been a co-course director and instructor for one of the core biotechnology laboratory techniques classes since the inception of the biotechnology program. Her didactic content in the team- taught Functional Cell Biology course is consistently highly rated by graduate students. With the launch of a new Graduate College program, the Integrated Biomedical Science, or IBS, Program, she participated in the planning, implementation and development of an entirely new graduate curriculum and was appointed as the IBS assistant program director. In that capacity, she was the inaugural IBS master's program administrator and participated in admission decisions, the creation of program policies and procedures, and acted as a first-year adviser to incoming students. For the 2017-18 academic year, she attained an average Graduate College student evaluation rating of 4.28/5 for instruction in the Graduate College's IBS Core Curriculum and Biotechnology Programs. \"Dr. Al-Ghoul has a tremendous grasp of the topics, providing required depth and relevant clinical applications without overwhelming her students,\" says Anita Joy, BDS, PhD, chair and associate professor in the Department of Growth, Development and Structure at the SIU School of Dental Medicine, who was a prior student and PhD advisee under Al-Ghoul. \"In small-group settings, she always allowed us to think through a challenge and deduce solutions rather than offering answers. One thing always stood out: her attention to detail. This trait speaks volumes toward her excellence and the willingness to be accountable to herself, her students and her profession.\" Excellence in EducationFaculty Recognition RECEPTION 6 Back to table of contents.7Nell S. Lurain, PhD Nell Lurain, PhD, professor in the Department of Microbial Pathogens and Immunity, joined Rush in 1994. For more than 20 years, Lurain has devoted a significant portion of her academic career at Rush to teaching in both the Graduate College and Rush Medical College. In the Graduate College, she regularly teaches the Molecular Biology core course and the seminar courses related to molecular biology and has served on numerous graduate student master's and PhD committees. In the Medical College, she was associate course director in charge of the laboratory portion of the microbiology course for several years under the school's previous curriculum. In recent years, she has been heavily involved with the development of the M1 and M2 curriculums. She is the deputy discipline director for microbiology for the new Rush Medical College integrated curriculum, working as a basic science content expert in microbiology for M1 and M2 students in small groups and collaborating with clinical educators in small group classrooms. She also served on the M2 Organ Curriculum Block Administrator Work Group and M2 Work Group. In addition, she serves on the Admissions Committee and is an application screener and open file interviewer. She uses innovative approaches such as lightning rounds in her instruction to ensure that students capture material effectively. Anonymous student surveys show the respect and adoration students have for her: \"Dr. Nell's lectures were by far the best in the block, and her lecture should be followed by other lecturers. The way she incorporated the material into our background knowledge was phenomenal.\" Lurain's research background includes over 30 years of both basic and clinical molecular studies of human cytomegalovirus, or HCMV, especially drug-resistant HCMV and assay development. With this experience, \"She strives to develop an understanding in her students that can be applied clinically, ensuring they can demonstrate competency on exams and, more importantly, in their careers as clinicians. She holds us to a high standard, and expects us to understand not just how we treat agents of disease but why we treat them the way we do. She understands our generation will confront unmet clinical challenges posed by the pathologic agents she has worked with her entire career,\" first-year medical students James Baker and Malcolm Gebauer said in their collaborative letter of support. If Dr. Lurain poses a question in class that is met with the silence of student ambiguity, she doubles back on our discussion and eliminates our uncertainty.\" Robert Leven, PhD, associate professor, Department of Cell and Molecular Medicine, says, \"Two years ago Lurain realized that many students were using the USMLE Step 1 prep program Sketchy Micro to study for the exam. She went through all of the viruses that Sketchy covered, making note of any inaccuracies so she could incorporate them into her lectures and students would be prepared and still learn the material.\" Even with her commitment to education, she still finds time to tutor kids on the West Side of Chicago through a program called Cluster Tutoring. She has been tutoring there since 2005 and became a board member of the organization in 2009. She has found this program to be inspirational for its goals to raise student reading and math skills. Excellence in EducationFaculty Recognition RECEPTION Back to table of contents.Markus A. Wimmer, PhD Markus Wimmer, PhD, is the Grainger Director of the Rush Arthritis and Orthopedics Institute in Chicago, professor and associate chair for Research in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery. He joined Rush University in 2001. His research focuses on both osteoarthritis and total joint replacement, and he uses motion analysis and tribology to study the wear and lubrication of natural and artificial joints. He has published over 190 manuscripts and 40 book chapters. Wimmer has mentored approximately 40 international short-term trainees, has been an adviser/co-adviser for 31 master's or master's-equivalent theses and an adviser/co-adviser for 13 PhD theses, two of which are current. He takes his MS and PhD advisees to one conference per year and encourages them to publish their research findings in peer reviewed journals. Nine of his PhD students who graduated during the past 10 years produced 29 manuscripts that are now listed in Scopus. He has mentored 20 postdoctoral fellows (two current). Seven of his postdoctoral fellows were eligible for NIH training grants (TGE). Six of them now hold faculty positions in U.S. institutions and four are independently NIH funded. Several of the non-TGE postdoctoral fellows are in leading positions in their respective countries. With his trainees, Markus has made major scientific contributions to orthopedics, as reflected by the large number of shared publications with his mentees. Wimmer has also been involved as a mentor in previous T32 training grants at Rush. He is the new designated co-director of a T32 postdoctoral trainee grant about joint Health at Rush. Because of his involvement in Research as the principal investigator and co-investigator on several NIH (R03, R01, R21, SCOR, RC2) and industry funded projects, he has been involved as a mentor in Rush mentoring program since its inception. Many of his mentees have prestigious accomplishments. For example, Hannah Lundberg, PhD, now an associate professor in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Rush and an NIH-funded investigator, was a recipient of a NIH F32 Postdoctoral Fellowship Grant. \"My decision to take a six-month internship at Markus's lab at Rush literally changed my professional life,\" says Thomas Nagel, chair of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, Technical University Bergakademie in Freiberg, Germany, who was a mentee under Wimmer for 12 years and still collaborates with him. \"He taught me how to structure a scientific article, how to formulate and test hypotheses and how to critically discuss the results. By now, Markus had demonstrated to me several times by example what collaboration means in the scientific community and how to keep a team productive despite its members being distributed around the globe. At the age of 34, I became the youngest full professor my university has appointed in modern times, and I owe Markus a lot of gratitude embarking on this career.\" Kharma Foucher, MD, PhD, assistant professor, Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says, \"While I worked with Markus, I published eight first-author manuscripts with him as last author and had the opportunity to contribute to many others. With his support and encouragement, I successfully competed for an NIH loan repayment award. I also successfully competed for two internal grants and was a finalist for the Orthopaedic Research Society New Investigator Recognition Award. He fosters an environment of innovative, collaborative research where mentees form strong bonds with each other with mutual respect as the foundation.\"Excellence in MentoringFaculty Recognition RECEPTION 8 Back to table of contents.9George Fitchett, DMin, PhD George Fitchett, DMin, PhD, is a professor and the director of Research in the Department of Religion, Health and Human Values at the College of Health Sciences. He also holds an appointment in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Rush Medical College. Fitchett has been a pioneer in the development of evidence-based spiritual care in the U.S. and around the world. In 1990, he initiated a program in his department aimed at using research to improve the spiritual care provided to patients, families and staff. This was the first such program in a chaplaincy department, and it has become a model for the profession. In 2002, Fitchett was the first chaplain to receive an NIH career development award. He is currently one of the principal investigators of a National Cancer Institute-funded R01 study of the effects of Dignity Therapy on spiritual and psycho-social outcomes for older patients with cancer who are receiving palliative care. It is believed this is the first NIH-funded study to include a chaplain intervention. Ten years ago, Fitchett recognized that case studies would play an important role in spiritual care research. Since then, he has edited, along with U.K. chaplain Steve Nolan, two books about chaplain case studies: Spiritual Care in Practice and Case Studies in Spiritual Care. As a result of his efforts, there are now nearly 30 published chaplain case studies from chaplains working in diverse clinical contexts from North America, U.K. and Europe as well as Israel and Australia. His initiative also led to the Dutch Case Study project, a four-year project in which 50 Dutch chaplains are meeting to share and publish case studies about their work. Fitchett's research has documented the important role of religion and spirituality in coping with illness for patients with diverse conditions, including cancer, mental illness, patients in medical rehabilitation and those receiving palliative care. An area of special interest has been patients who have spiritual concerns, pain or struggle, such as those who feel abandoned or punished by God. His research has described the prevalence and correlates of religion and spirituality struggle in diverse clinical populations. His research produced one of the first reports of the harmful effects of religion and spirituality struggle on recovery of functional status in medical rehabilitation patients. Fitchett, in collaboration with Wendy Cadge, PhD, (Brandeis University), co-directs the Transforming Chaplaincy project, an initiative to advance research literacy among health care chaplains funded by a $4.5 million grant from the John Templeton Foundation. The project has supported 17 chaplains in completing master's research degrees, has added research literacy education to one third of the chaplaincy training programs in the U.S., is introducing practicing chaplains to research basics and has brought information about research to chaplains around the world with a new chaplaincy research website. Another product of the project is the new book, Evidence-Based Healthcare Chaplaincy: A Research Reader , which Fitchett co-edited. Patricia Murphy, PhD, associate professor, Department of Religion, Health and Human Values, says, \"Fitchett has encouraged the research of these new investigators so they can become leaders in educating others about research. He worked closely with them to help them submit their first article and give public presentations of their research projects. If chaplains are to provide excellent care for patients, they need to apply evidence-based interventions. He is, probably, the most respected leader of this endeavor.\" Excellence in ResearchFaculty Recognition RECEPTION Back to table of contents.10Faculty Recognition RECEPTION Barbara Swanson, PhD, RN, FAAN, ACRN Barbara Swanson, PhD, RN, FAAN, ACRN is a professor in the Department of Adult Health and Gerontological Nursing and an assistant dean of Nursing Science Studies in the College of Nursing. During her career, she has collaborated with health care researchers across multiple disciplines, has been the principal investigator on six extramural funded grants and the co-investigator on an additional six extramural funded grants. Swanson has researched different types of treatments for HIV-associated symptoms beyond traditional antiretrovirals. Her work has led to several important findings: cortisol upregulates HIV replication in cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages in a dose-dependent manner, tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations in random plasma specimens do not correlate with neuropsychological function in early HIV infection, sugar cane-derived policosanol does not favorably modulate parameters of dyslipidemia in HIV-infected persons, and nuclear magnetic resonance-derived LDL particle cutoffs may be more sensitive in identifying HIV-infected persons at risk for CHD than standard NCEP LDL cholesterol cutoffs. One of her early studies of HIV-infected women found that women preferentially lose fat mass rather than lean mass compared to men and that body composition in asymptomatic infected women does not covary with indices of disease progression. These findings suggested gender differences in the trajectory of HIV disease and its manifestations \u2014 differences that are well known and accepted today. More recently, her work has centered on decreasing health disparities among historically disadvantaged persons with HIV infection. She is the principal investigator conducting a trial funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities researching fish oil for the following: favorably modulate cell surface senescence markers on CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, reduce production of inflammatory cytokines by immune cells and favorably modulate indirect markers of gut permeability in clinically stable HIV-infected persons. These findings hold the potential to show that nontoxic and affordable marine oil supplements may improve cardiac risk profile and improve inflammaging. \"The impact of her research has spanned multiple disciplines and has made substantial contributions to improving the clinical care of HIV-infected populations,\" says Wrenetha Julion, PhD, MPH, RN, FAAN, professor in the Department of Women, Children and Family Nursing. Applying technology in health research, Swanson with a team of clinical and basic scientists is developing a protocol to train an artificial olfactory system to distinguish volatile organic compound patterns in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients and healthy controls. Additionally, she has been instrumental in advancing the Nursing Science PhD program at Rush. She has been successful in obtaining Robert Wood Johnson, Jonas Scholar and Golden Lamp Society funding for PhD students. She has been either the adviser for or member of over 20 doctoral student committees, is a nationally recognized scholar and recently completed serving as chair of the Emerging Diseases Expert Panel with the American Academy of Nursing. Swanson, as lead editor of Association of Nurses in AIDS Care (ANAC) Core Curriculum for HIV/AIDS Nursing (third edition\u2014 a book that is recommended by the HIV/AIDS nursing Certification Board as a study guide \u2014 and associate editor of the Journal of the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care, has impacted the translation and publication of findings to improve the health and well-being of HIV-infected persons. Additionally, she has served as an editorial board member or reviewer for 17 other journals and has published over 80 articles and book chapters.
