Wnuk, Professor Yi Xiao, Assistant Professor Graduate Admission Requirements 1. A minimum undergraduate grade point average (GPA) of 3.0/4.0 in chem istry and cognate science courses and submission of official GRE scores are required. International graduate student applicants whose native language is not English are required to submit a score for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). A total score of 80 on the iBT TOEFL or 6.5 overall on the IELTS is required. 2. Applicants must send a statement of purpose and arrange to have sent transcripts and three letters of recommendation evaluating the applicant's potential for graduate work. Originals of these items must be sent to the FIU Graduate Admissions office as specified at http://gradschool.fiu.edu . In addition, copies of these items sh ould be mailed directly to the Graduate Program Director (general M.S. and Ph.D. programs) or the Forensic Science Graduate Program Director (Forensic Track Ph.D.). Prospective candidates should refer to both the above website and http://casgroup.fiu.edu/chemistry/ for details regarding the application procedure, part of w hich must be completed on -line. 3. Formal admission to the M.S. and Ph.D. programs is granted by the Graduate Admissions Office. Awards of teaching assistantships are granted by the Graduate Program Director. The Graduate Committee recommends admissions on the basis of a ranking of graduate applicants made by the pertinent committee (for example, the Forensic Graduate Committee for forensic t rack applicants). Entrance is possible at the beginning of each semester (fall, spring, summer). For consideration for a graduate assistantship, all application materials should be received at least five months prior to the desired starting date. 4. Students whose undergraduate degree is not equivalent to the American Chemical Society certified Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry may be required to make up deficiencies. For example, depending on his or her area of specialization, a student may be required to make up deficiencies in quantum mechanics, instrumental analysis, or biochemistry by successfully completing Graduate Physical Chemistry II (CHM 5426), Graduate Analytical Methods (CHM 5150), or Graduate Biological Chemistry (CHM 5305) respectively. 5. Entering graduate students must pass two proficiency exams. Proficiencies are offered in organic, physical, inorganic, analytical, and biochemistry. One pass must be in either organic or physical chemistry; the other is open. The proficiency exams will be administered to incoming graduate students in the week before the fall and spring semesters. If a student fails to receive a pass in a proficiency exam, he or she must show proficiency by completing the appropriate course with a grade of \"B\" (3.0/4.0) or better. These courses are Graduate Organic Chemistry (CHM 5225), Graduate Physical Chemistry (CHM 5425), Graduate Analytical Methods (CHM 5150), and Graduate Biological Chemistry (CHM 5305). Students are expected to complete proficiency requirements by the end of their first semester. 6. Graduate students must maintain a GPA of 3.0/4.0. Only courses applicable to the graduate program, excluding those for making up deficiencies or satisfying proficiencies, are counted in the GPA. If the cumulative GPA drops bel ow 3.0 for one semester, the student will be placed on academic probation. A student who fails to raise his or her GPA to 3.0 or higher within one semester will be dismissed from the program. 7. Full-time graduate students generally serve as a Teaching Assis tants (TA's) in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry for their first semester. Ph.D. candidates must serve as TA's for at least one 132 College of Arts and Sciences Graduate Catalog 20 13-2014 year except in unusual circumstances. TA's are awarded on a competitive basis, require a minimum cumulative GPA of 3 .0, and can be continued for up to two years for M.S. students and four years for Ph.D. students who maintain acceptable academic performance. A limited number of Graduate Research Assistantships (RA's) may be available. Transfer of Credits and Financial Support Transfer of credits. Students having an M.S. in chemistry may transfer as many as 36 credits towards their Ph.D. degree. However, no more than six of those credits will count toward fulfillment of the formal course work requirement. More than six credits for formal course work can be transferred only with special permission of the Graduate Committee, in which case the number of additional course work credits required will depend on the student's performance in courses, the date courses were complet ed, and the area of Ph.D. concentration. Financial Support. Full-time graduate students in good academic standing are eligible for financial support. Teaching and research assistantships are available on a competitive basis. Inquiries concerning applicat ion to the program and availability of financial support should be directed to the Chemistry Graduate Program Director.
