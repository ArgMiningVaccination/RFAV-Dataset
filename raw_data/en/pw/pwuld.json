Bring autumn's fall color to your front door with this easy entryway treatment that takes only minutes to create. Use three Hy-Vee fall leaf wreaths\u2014hang one from ribbon on the door and place two atop urns lled with twigs or branches. Autumn Leaf Wreath 1 2seasons / FALL 2007harvest d\u00e9cor WRITTEN BY JILANN SEVERSON PHOTOGRAPHED BY TOBIN BENNETTBring fall color and fragrance to your home with creative fl oral designs, fresh produce, and home and garden accessories from Hy-Vee. In a matter of an hour or two, your home will be a beautiful, welcoming fall retreat. Decorating for fall doesn't need to be a laborious, time-inten- sive task. As you make your way through the aisles of Hy-Vee each week, check the produce, fl oral, and seasonal departments for all you need for fall decorating. Find colors, textures, and motifs that bring the richness of autumn to both the inside and outside of your home. As the weather turns cool and crisp, the decorating options are bountiful! Lori Trotter, Iowa Master Florist (IMF), is an award- winning designer who manages the fl oral department at West Des Moines Hy-Vee #2. She suggests deciding the overall look you want rst, then creating quick and easy arrangements to achieve it. For eye-popping displays that add excitement, use complementary colors\u2014those opposite each other on the color wheel. High contrast adds excitement to a room. Orange and blue, red and green, or yellow and purple are some of the vivid combinations fl orists commonly use. The colors naturally found in fall leaves and gourds make it easy to bring con- trast to an arrangement or the whole room. Fill clear vases with miniature gourds, mixing or matching the colors and variet- ies, then add ties of raf a or ribbon. Create a simple mantel dec- oration by lining a row of gourds, tiny pumpkins, or bright green hedge apples. For a subtle look, use a monochromatic theme that keeps the colors in tune with the room as well as with each other. A combination of neutrals is the most elegant: think white pumpkins, off-white candles, and ivory roses arranged on an ironstone platter. Texture plays an important role in fall decorating. Again, the higher the contrast the more eye-catching the arrangement. The combination of rough and smooth gourds, pinecones, and waxen leaves in a large tureen is a tried-and-true winner. The woven basket of gourds, candles, and pinecones, page 5, is another example of contrasting textures. For a different take on texture, the candle in the footed hurricane, above, is surrounded by coffee beans. The smoothness of the beans matches that of the candle and the glass for a sophisticated look. Mini pinecones would create a more informal look. A wreath of brilliantly colored arti cial leaves is used in three different ways both inside and outside the house. Get several uses from a single wreath or create unity by using multiples of the same wreath throughout your home. Hy-Vee also offers other fl oral needs including glass containers and mini harvest fruits. Golden Harvest Bouquet $25.00 3season s / hy-vee.com 3season s / hy-vee.comLori says that creating displays in your home is similar to merchandising in a store. Check the arrangement from every angle. No matter where you stand, the view should be attractive and interesting. Vary the height to keep your eye moving. The little scare- crow dolls perched on miniature hay bales, left, have more interest when their heights are staggered. Gourds can be piled in vessels of different heights or even perched atop candlestick holders. When entertaining, pull out all the stops and extend the decorations beyond a single centerpiece or wreath. Lori of- ten makes the same arrangement in three different sizes and suggests people do the same thing when decorating at home. Single fall elements such as gourds, leaves, or mums makes it simple to spread the decorations around. \"Using decorations beyond the centerpiece extends the overall look beyond the tabletop,\" says Lori. \"It helps set the mood, whether it's intimate or a feeling of grandeur.\" As fall grows closer, the bounty at Hy-Vee will grow larger\u2014and so will your decorating options. Floral Manager Lori Trotter, IMF, of West Des Moines Hy-Vee (at the corner of Grand Avenue and EP True Parkway) won the prestigious B\u00f6rgen Cup award at the Super Floral Show in Columbus, Ohio. Awards are given for color harmony, cross- merchandising, signage, theme development, and use of stand- alone displays. Lori's design won for color harmony. Her display was a promotion for the Hy-Vee Triathlon and incorporated a metal tandem bicycle into the arrangement in honor of the bicycling segment of the competition. Daisies of all sorts made up the floral portion, playing off the song \"Bicycle Built for Two\" and its line \"Daisy, Daisy ... .\" \"Some people didn't get it and some thought it was corny, but I liked it,\" says Lori. Apparently, so did the judges. Lori used all types of daisies, including gerbera daisies, daisy mums, tinted daisies, daisy bouquets, and even daisy balloons. Lori incorporated color blocking, a technique of blending colors so the display looks different from every angle because the LORI TROTTER WINS B\u00d6RGEN AWARD LEFT: Harvest Stick Leg Characters 30\" 1 ct. BELOW: Assorted Fall Color Vases 11\" to 14.25\" $20.00 (vase only) colors change as you move around it yet it still looks unified and coordinated from every vantage point. She uses the technique in almost all of her arrangements and displays. Lori has won many other awards, including the Iowa Florist Association People's Choice Award, but the B\u00f6rgen Cup is the most prestigious. Lori refers to the coveted award as \"quite the big deal\" and plans to display the trophy, left, at the store. 4seasons / FALL 2007 1. Long Lasting Rover Fall Bouquet, fl owers only $12.50 2.

Here's how to prepare memorable meals in 30 minutes or less. Traditional dishes do more than fill the tummy\u2014they fill the soul. The aroma of simmering soups, roasting meats and veggies, and baking casseroles envelopes your home and heart. As family members arrive home, enticing smells draw them to the dinner table with the promise of a meal to savor. Many tried- and-true recipes have become surprisingly uncomplicated, require little time, and make use of time-saving techniques. MEMORY-FILLED MEALS Some favorite dishes, rooted in nostalgia and often accom- panied by a twinge of guilt over the calories contained, can be updated, more healthful, and even more appealing. As you tailor meals, choose lean meats for oven-roasting or braising in slow cookers. Substitute low-fat cheese and low- sodium soups for favorite casserole recipes. Reduce butter and salt and substitute other seasonings for flavor. Get more ideas for recipes at www.hy-veerecipes.com. Many of these updated favorites incorporate time-saving strategies. For simple side dishes to serve with traditional entr\u00e9es, serve vegetables and fruits in their least complicated versions. MAKE IT EASY Take advantage of the many shortcuts offered at your local Hy-Vee stores when you prepare nostalgic meals. Look for produce that is ready to use\u2014cut-up carrots, frozen pearl onions, salad greens washed and ready to serve, and breads that wrap and warm in only a few minutes in the oven. Frozen and boxed dinners that call for the addition of meat or those that go into a slow cooker or roasting pan make healthful homemade meals a snap. When time is at a premium, count on the Hy-Vee Kitchen and fresh produce aisles to bring old-time favorites to your table. Ready-to-serve meat loaf, chef's salads, roasted rotisserie chickens, and an abundance of fresh sides are ready to transfer to serving dishes and place on the table. 12 34 1112 131456 10978 7season s / hy-vee.com 7season s / hy-vee.com\"I know the look of an apple that is roasting and sizzling on the hearth on a winter' s evening, and I know the comfort that comes of eating it hot, along with some sugar and a drench of cream...I know how the nuts taken in conjunction with winter apples, cider, and d o u g h n u t s m a k e o l d p e o p l e 's tales and old jokes sound fresh and crisp and enchanting .\" \u2014 MARK TWAIN 8seasons / FALL 2007An Apple a Day WRITTEN BY JULIE MARTENS PHOTOGRAPHED BY KING AUThe harvest is in, and the produce aisles at Hy-Vee are bursting with fresh-picked apples. Visit your local store to gather a bounty of favorites. Eat them out of hand, or whip them up in our family-friendly recipes. Autumn brings crunchy leaves underfoot and crunchy apples in hand. In addition to their All-American status in pies, apples are equally delicious sauced, steamed, baked, dried, or fried. Foreign to North America, apple seeds hitched a ride with the Pilgrims and took root in New England. Massachusetts native John Chapman\u00b1\u2014better known as Johnny Appleseed\u2014staunchly believed in the health benefits of apples. For more than 49 years, he sowed seeds and planted seedlings from Pennsylvania's Allegheny River to Ohio, Kentucky, and west into Illinois. Thanks to a sea captain who slipped seeds in his pocket in London in 1824, apples sprouted in Washington, which became the top apple-producing state in the U.S. Apples, from coast to coast, are easy to grow and they store well. As health care professionals tout the benefits of apples, Americans continue to clamor for the colorful, crunchy fruit. WHAT APPEAL Because apples are so good for you, feel good about eating them. On average, Americans eat an apple a week; folks in the Netherlands consume an apple a day. Adding them to your diet makes sense. The high fiber and antioxidants in apples lower cholesterol and may help prevent some cancers. Recent research indicates that apples may improve memory and protect against such age- related diseases as Alzheimer's. With a mere 80 calories, an apple supplies 5 grams of fiber\u2014 equal to a bowl of bran cereal\u2014and 20 percent of the daily fiber requirement! Fiber makes you feel full, which is beneficial for losing or maintaining weight. An apple for breakfast with a slice of whole wheat toast and peanut butter provides protein, fiber, and complex carbohydrates to keep you going all morning. 9season s / hy-vee.comBaked Appetizer Beverage SnackBakery Fresh Apple Turnovers 3 ct. $2.99 Bakery Fresh Caramel Apple Coffee Cake 16 oz. $2.88 Kitchen Fresh Apple Crisp 32 oz. $4.59 Do no Havarti Cheese selected varieties 8 oz. $3.48 Apple Sweet Apple Slices selected varieties 5 or 6 oz. 4/$5.00; 13 or 16 oz. 2/$5.00 Mulling Cinnamon Sticks 36 ct. $1.97 Aseltine's Fresh Apple Cider 1 gal. $2.98 Stemilt Gala, Red, Golden Delicious apples per lb. $1.28/lb.

Here are a few of the many delicious apples available from Stemilt: 12seasons / FALL 2007 12seasons / FALL 2007All About Apples SHOPPING SMART Select apples that are firm. One bad apple will spoil the whole bunch, so avoid fruit with brown or soft spots. Some apples boast fantastic flavor beneath less-than-perfect skins. Color varies by apple type, and redder isn't always better. Research at the University of Idaho found that the redder a Red Delicious apple, the less flavor it had. Choose varieties that suit specific purposes: tart for pies and applesauce, firm for baking, and sweet flesh for eating fresh. STORING Apples store well in humid and cool storage\u201435\u00b0F to 40\u00b0F with 80 to 90 percent humidity is ideal. Place them in plastic bags in a refrigerator drawer that retains humidity. Or store them briefly in an unheated basement or garage, but not too long\u2014apples absorb odors. PREPARING AND USING Before using apples, wash them well to remove any skin contaminants or coatings. Cut away bruises or soft spots. To prevent freshly cut apples from browning, dip them in 1 part citrus juice to 3 parts water, or use the product Fruit Fresh. Cook and store apples so they're ready for recipes and quick use. Refrigerate or freeze apple butter for tarts and pies, make applesauce to substitute for fat in baking, can or freeze cooked apple slices for recipes and toppings, and dry apple slices for snacks and recipes.KITCHEN HINTS Get creative when you cook, bake, and serve apples. Treat family and friends often to homemade apple pie, but don't stop there! Apples boast such versatility. They're as irresistible in desserts as they are in savory main dishes and sides. Looking for a few new recipes to make use of your windfall of apples? Check the recipes at www .hy-veerecipes.com. Meanwhile, whet your appetite with these cooking tips. Main course creations. Team apples with unexpected partners for taste treats. Whip up a cream-based soup with steamed mashed apples and turnips. Give apples a kick by cooking them with pork tenderloin that's braised with horseradish sauce. And serve apple chunks, broccoli, and ham over whole wheat pasta. Great companions. Some foods naturally complement one another, with flavors enhanced and blended in a scrumptious work of art. Paired with smoked turkey, sharp cheddar cheese, fresh ginger (delicious in homemade applesauce!), apples assume the starring role. Apples tossed with greens and feta cheese, then drizzled with tarragon-vinegar-and- oil dressing, will reap compliments for the tantalizing flavors. Just desserts. Make every day of the week special. Serve grand finales that feature apples in their sweetest dress: ma- ple syrup and cinnamon-sprinkled baked apples, Apple Brown Betty (toss in cranberries for a taste twist), apple-hazelnut quick bread, and apple-cherry pie.

BLACK AND CARLEEN SIPES PHOTOGRAPHED BY KING AU, TOBIN BENNETT, PETE KRUMHARDT 14seasons / FALL 2007Armed with chili powder, jalepe\u00f1o peppers, and secret seasonings, cooks across the country battle for the title of \"chili king.\" Whether it's an all-in-good-fun family challenge, the annual of ce cook-off, or a regional competition with high stakes and honors, anyone with a spice rack and a spirit of adventure can take part. Recipe ingredients and heat from the chiles run the gamut\u2014limited only by imagination. Although chili is typically considered the reddish color beef-and-bean soup ladened with onion and spicy powder, that's only the tip of the soup ladle. Chili is served in a wide variety of colors, with an even wider range of meats as the base. And the heat for chili ranges from mild to three-alarm fire, depending on the type of peppers used. Chili contests, examples of individualism as well as regionalism, have a major impact on recipes and ingredients. To learn more about chili, we visited with five Hy-Vee chefs, each with their own recipes, and listened as they discussed the diversity of this popular and zesty dish. Midwesterners tend to remain faithful to classic ground beef and beans. \"Texans refuse to put beans in it,\" says Kim Burow, a Hy-Vee corporate executive chef in West Des Moines. \"In Cincinnati, they put pasta in it.\" Chef Kim often presides over the company chili cook-off\u2014a fund-raiser that benefits the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation\u2014and he has encountered variation upon variation. \"We see some fun stuff,\" he says. \"There's nine-bean chili, seafood chili. Some people were serving it over homemade fries.\" Alfonso Hernandez, chef at a Hy-Vee meat department in Rochester, Minnesota, also marvels at the vast array of recipes. \"There's so much out there,\" he says. \"I have a lot of customers who bring me venison, black bear, and caribou, and ask me to put it in a chili for them. Rabbit works really well, too,\" says Chef Al. \"And I like using different beans\u2014navy beans, white beans, pinto beans, kidney beans.\" Other chefs use a recipe as a guide and vary it batch by batch. \"I have my own way of cooking chili, and it has to be my way or it doesn't work out at all,\" says Billy Shelton, who works in the kitchen at an Omaha Hy-Vee. That said, \"I taste it as I'm making it. I can tell you my recipe, but as I'm cooking, I may add just a touch more chili powder. Then I'll let it simmer for five minutes and taste it again.\" Chuck Worth, chef and seafood manager in a Rochester Hy-Vee, says, \"There are so many ways of making chili. It's all very personal, but you have to start out with good ingredients\u2014 good lean meat to start with and you have to have good seasonings.\" Then simmer. And simmer some more. But ... . \"Slow-cook, but don't overcook,\" Chef Kim says. \"If you cook it too long, the beans start breaking down and turn to mush,\" says Chef Chuck. \"The meat breaks down and you lose the character of the dish.\" \"Everyone has a chili recipe in them,\" says Steve \"Swany\" Swancutt, kitchen manager at a Rochester Hy-Vee. Begin with your choice of meat and add other ingredients. Invite friends over for taste-testing, and see whether you can develop your own signature soup. Families, friends, and coworkers can easily organize an annual chili cook-off. Let your iron- chef pals display their culinary skills while everyone else samples the chili specialties. Chili cook-offs also can be a sideline\u2014at tailgate parties, family reunions, and company picnics. Or they can be the main event at charity fund-raisers, with entry fees and serious prizes.

PEG SMITH PHOTOGRAPHED BY K ING AU INVITATION AND MOCKINGBIRD DESIGNS BY HEATHER HILLDinner at Conjure up a spirited evening in honor of Halloween. IT IS A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT AND THE STAGE IS SET WITH FLICKERING CANDLELIGHT, CREAK- ING DOORS, AND THE BAREST WHISPER OF MOCKINGBIRD WINGS. IT'S THE PERFECT SETTING FOR A GATHERING IN HONOR OF ALL HALLOWS' EVE. The guests enter the mansion through a curtain of ancient cobwebs and are greeted by the Butler, a creaky, doddering entity who plays his part well. The hallway is dark and narrow, and haunting music emanates from somewhere behind the walls to greet the costumed partici- pants as they enter the scene. An occasional shriek of a crow interrupts the quiet murmur of conversation and startles the guests, causing laughter and quick glances around the room for the source of the sounds. And what does the party host have in mind for them on this haunting evening? In mock dismay, the guests get involved in the theatrics of the evening and ask each other silly questions. \"Will we be cast under some magical spell?\" \"Will we be forced to take part in a Frankenstein-like experiment?\" \"Is there really a dungeon in the lower level of the mansion?\" \"Will we be banished to it?\" The attendees suspect that as the evening unfolds, there are bound to be surprises in store. 23season s / hy-vee.com 23season s / hy-vee.com1. Create a theme and let your guests know in advance ... or not. If you want to surprise them, keep your party plans under wraps. If you want the guests to dress to a particular theme, however, let them know at least a portion of the planned activities. 2. With your invitations, give your guests an inkling of the eerie elements your party will contain. Pique their curiosities and get them in the seasonal mood with the style, wording, and pictures you include. (Find an invitation pattern at www .hy-veeseasons.com.) 3. Set the stage outside the front door. Create a theatrical set to match what lies within. Cre- ate an arrangement of pumpkins, balloons, or other seasonal items; put up posters or copies of old photos; add mood lighting and music; or create a dark tunnel of suspense that guests must pass through on their way into the house. 4. Right inside the door, have a basket of masks for donning, as some guests may not come completely wrapped up for the occasion. (A variety of masks are available from Hy-Vee.) 5. Greet guests with a suitable interior. String cobwebs, float ghosts made from cheesecloth draped over helium balloons, and fly mockingbirds from the ceiling. (Find general instructions for the mockingbirds on page 28; mockingbird pattern and step- by-step instructions are at www.hy-veeseasons.com.) 6. Cast a soft glow with mood lighting: dimmed lamps, strings of seasonal lights, and candles. Note that electric candles are safer and require less attention than wax candles. (Find a variety of decorations and candles at Hy-Vee.) 7. Set up\u2014so you don't need to change CDs\u2014a playlist of ghostly music interspersed with eerie sounds to provide a suitable background for conversations. Include some just-for-fun songs, such as \"Mon- ster Mash.\" Who knows, your monsters in attendance may feel like boogying along. 8. Serve a chilling assortment of delicious predinner \"potions\" and label each of the beverages at the bar so guests can serve them- selves as they dare. 9. Have fun setting the dinner table. Follow our example (see pages 26-27 and left ) with dishes, glassware, and flowers from Hy-Vee. Color it traditional in black, white, and orange. Cover the table with a length of black sheer fabric torn along the edges, and \"float\" tableware on clear plastic stands (created by using recycled clear plastic food containers). When it's time to draw your guests into the dining room, instruct Albert to strike the dinner gong. 10. Serve foods that fit your theme. For ease, purchase some already-prepared dishes and make one or two specialties, such as Glazed Mockingbird Wings and Carrot Pumpkin and Dip, page 28. For fun, label each food with a Halloween-themed name. Print a menu for each place at the table, if you wish. 11. Call upon old books, television shows, or movies to help create a chilling atmosphere. Read aloud a section from Bram Stoker's Dracula or Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Air sections of an old horror movie or view a DVD of a classic television show, such as The Munsters (the original inhabitants of 1313 Mockingbird Lane) or The Addams Family. 12. If you invite children, hire several teens to organize and manage the games and serve the goodies. Hold the kids' gather- ing in the basement, garage, or outdoors if the weather cooper- ates. Be sure to decorate their party space to fit the theme of their party (see pages 29-33 for ideas). 13. Join your guests in sharing the spirit of friendship, laugh- ter, and fun of this unusual holiday.Dressed for Dinner 13 WAYS TO SET UP A SPIRITED SCENE 24seasons / FALL 200751 3 7 9 1162 4 8 10 12 1.

Tie fabric ribbon around two vases and fringe the ends; use a rhinestone belt buckle (available from fabric or antiques stores) to make a belted sash on the third container.

While the fun is inevitable, the \"trick\" is to keep everyone safe during the festivities. Use common sense and follow these safety guidelines: * When carving pumpkins, let the kids draw the funny or scary face in marker on the pumpkin. Have an adult make the cuts. To light up the pumpkin, electric lights are safer than candles. Caution: Don't leave a candle-lit jack-o'-lantern on the front porch where kids' costumes might brush against it. * Choose kids' costumes that are fl ame-retardant and loose enough to allow kids to add a warm layer of clothing beneath (but not baggy enough so kids trip on them). Add refl ective tape strips to a dark costume for best visibility by car drivers. For added protection, put refl ective tape on treat bags. * Choose masks that have large eyeholes and both nose and mouth openings. Even better, use face paint instead of masks. * Adults must accompany young children on their rounds through the neighborhood. Take along a fl ashlight and a cell phone and consider having another parent drive and park near where you'll be walking. The group should have a prescribed route and a curfew and follow traf c and street-crossing rules. Remind your children they need to stay close and not enter strangers' homes or cars. A good rule is to only visit homes of people you know. * Do not allow snacking along the route. Adults should check the treats when children get home before they are allowed to sample. Eat only treats that are prepackaged and completely wrapped and sealed. Pumpkin Packages\u2014Cut a rectangle of crepe paper; loosely gather and twist one end with a pipe cleaner. Turn inside out so the cleaner is on the inside. Gather again to form a round shape; l l w i t h g o o d i e s a n d top with a twisted pipe cleaner. Add paper features using black construction paper. Crafty \"Crackers\"\u2014Cover empty toilet paper tubes in deckle-scissor-trimmed crepe paper, leaving several inches of extra length on each end. Fill with tiny treasures; twist and secure the ends (ours are sewn shut, but ribbon ties work as well). Cover with scrapbook papers cut with crafts scis- sors and embellish with stickers or rub-ons from Hy-Vee. The rub-ons shown are sold in the Halloween Scrapbook Kit on page 25. 33season s / hy-vee.comThe Gre at Pum pki n WRITTEN BY JULIE MARTENS PHOTOGRAPHED BY PETE KRUMHARDT Take home a variety of pumpkins from Hy-Vee's bountiful selection for fall decorating. Use pumpkins to tuck into outdoor displays, line a window, side- board, or entry, or create topiaries using three graduated size pumpkins, largest on the bottom\u2014smallest on the top, in pots or urns. Carving kits, also available at Hy-Vee (see pages 40 and 41), provide small tools and instructions for inspiring carved designs that can be lit with tea lights (see page 5). 34seasons / FALL 2007Picking just one perfect pumpkin among the plethora at Hy-Vee could pose a perplexing puzzle for those in pursuit of the one and only \" great pumpkin.\" But why struggle? Fill a cart and proclaim pumpkin perfection with decorations indoors and out and with our palate-pleasing recipes. You know fall is in full swing when pumpkins appear on doorsteps, hearths, and kitchen tables. Although many folks favor pumpkins for carving or the traditional turkey day pie, these orange fruits can fill any number of roles\u2014in seasonal d\u00e9cor, on the dinner table, and in crafty creations. As autumn unfolds and you see the pumpkin patch sprouting at Hy-Vee, set your sights on using these fall jewels in new ways. Let us inspire you. PASS THE PUMPKIN, PLEASE Treat your family to homey fare that features pumpkin. With its bright orange flesh, one serving of pumpkin (one-half cup, cooked) dishes up a day's supply of vitamin A and a mere 40 calories. Its high fiber content (4 g) helps curb appetites, making pumpkin a good choice for dieters. This autumn beauty also boasts vitamin C, potassium, calcium, iron, and folate. Rich in beta-carotene, pumpkins earn a spot on the list of good-for-you foods that fight cancer, heart disease, and aging. Pumpkin's culinary repertoire goes far beyond pies, nut breads, and cake rolls. Substitute pumpkin in any recipe that calls for sweet potatoes or winter squash. Or showcase them in elegant creations, such as seafood-stuffed pumpkins, roasted fall veggies with fennel and sausage, or pumpkin souffl\u00e9. For everyday autumn menus, dice a pumpkin, steam it, season with nutmeg, and serve it as a side dish. Mix pumpkin chunks with apples, cranberries, and raisins for a classic fall fruit pie. Cut small pumpkins in half, place halves cut side up in a pan with 1 inch of water, and bake, covered, at 350\u00b0F for 60 minutes. Remove cover and bake 30 minutes more or until fork tender. For a sweet dish, serve it filled with butter and brown sugar. For fewer calories, use applesauce and cinnamon. Spice it up with hot Italian sausage, curried rice, or Cajun jambalaya filling.COOKING BASICS Process pumpkin into puree to use in soups, stews, and baked goods. Slice the fruit in half, scoop out seeds and stringy membranes, then place pumpkin cut side down on a parchment- lined baking pan. Bake at 350\u00b0F for 45 to 60 minutes or until fork tender. Cool, and peel skin. If skin doesn't remove easily, bake longer. To puree, place the peeled cooked pumpkin in a food processor, blender, potato masher, or ricer. Remove any remaining strings from processed pumpkin using a mixer; strings will wrap around spinning beaters. If puree is for pie, make it extra smooth by pressing it through a fine sieve or food mill after initial processing. Puree spoils after 36 hours. If you don't plan to use it immediately, store it in tightly sealed containers in the freezer. For make-ahead ease, measure out amounts for recipes, then label containers accordingly. To use pumpkin puree in baking recipes to reduce the amount of fat, substitute equal amounts of puree for shortening, margarine, or butter. Transform fresh pumpkin into a hearty flour that can be substituted for whole wheat flour. Cut fresh pumpkin in thin slices. Dry slices in a single layer in a slow oven (250\u00b0F).

PICK YOUR PUMPKIN Celebrate fall by gathering your gang and heading out to your favorite pumpkin patch\u2014at Hy-Vee. As you sort through the pile, choose pumpkins by how you plan to use them. For carving, select robust round fruit with plenty of girth for designs. 35season s / hy-vee.comBakery Fresh Pumpkin Pie 10\" $8.99Delicious pumpkin pies, made fresh by the bakers at Hy-Vee, are too good to be enjoyed only on holidays. Creamy textured and full of fresh pumpkin and spice fl avor, these pies match perfectly with fresh whipped cream. Enjoy a slice with a cup of hot coffee. 36seasons / FALL 2007For pumpkins that will be used for cooking, select small fruits. Carving pumpkins, or field types, usually have tough, stringy flesh. Sugar pumpkins, culinary cousins, have dense, sweet, less stringy, bright orange flesh. They often are referred to as \"pie\" or \"Cinderella\" pumpkins. When choosing pumpkins to cook with, look for those that weigh from two to six pounds. Each pound of whole pumpkin yields one cup of puree. Whole pumpkins store well, lasting several months. Select fruits with no decay or soft spots and firm rinds that don't scratch easily when a fingernail is pulled across. Pumpkins with long stems (1 to 2 inches) last longest. Store pumpkins in a cool, dry place in temperatures between 50\u00b0F and 55\u00b0F. An unheated basement or enclosed porch is ideal for storing pumpkins or winter squash. GET CREATIVE! Try something new in place of typical autumn displays of pumpkins, hay bales, corn shocks, and gourds. Let these ideas inspire creativity. Serving bowl Cut the top off a small pumpkin, hollow it out, and ladle it full of your family's favorite fall soup. Candleholder Using small pumpkins that sit flat, remove stems, and use a sharp knife to carve a ring from the top that's slightly larger than the base of a candle and making the hole deep enough to steady the candle. Vase Slip a jar inside a hollowed pumpkin. Fill the jar with fresh flower food from a Hy-Vee florist and a mix of fall flowers and greens. Silk flowers last even longer. Place card holders In small pumpkins, cut a sliver just deep enough to hold place cards for guests.

Indoor efforts pave the way for holiday gatherings, leaving you time to focus on food prep and enjoying family and friends. Not sure where to start? Follow our fall chore checklist and work your way from the outside in. Or recruit family members to help, and you can tackle multiple fronts at once. LEAF PATROL Falling leaves herald the season of raking, gutter cleaning, and composting. When leaves hide the top half of grass blades, it's time to rake, vacuum, or mow. Mowing leaves can eliminate raking and gives turf a bonus feed- ing (leaves equal nitrogen). If you rake leaves into a pile, reduce the volume by renting a shredder or chipper. Choose the equipment based on reduction ratio. For instance, a ratio of 10:1 means the machine condenses 10 bags of leaves into one. Compost shredded leaves or scatter them on planting beds as mulch. Clean gutters, then run water through them to inspect drainage. Make sure water is directed far enough from the house and away from sidewalks and driveways to avoid winter icing. To compost leaves, chop them to decrease decomposition time, and pile them in a simple bin. If your family likes to stuff leaves into pumpkin-faced garbage bags, chop the leaves rst, then stack the bags out of sight through winter. You'll have bags of mulch come spring. Enhance decomposition by adding a few shovels of real garden soil to each bag. YARD & GARDEN In areas with hard freezes, empty irrigation systems, and drain and store garden hoses. Shut off water to outdoor spigots or install insulated covers. Inspect trellises, fences, and outdoor structures. Make neces-sary repairs. Consider applying a fresh coat of paint. Plant trees, shrubs, and perennials in early fall. Complete planting chores before leaves tumble from trees. Remember to water fall-planted items until the ground freezes. Plan to add a planting area? Start a new bed effortlessly by placing 4-6 sheets of newsprint or a single layer of corrugated card- board over existing grass. Pile on 4-6 inches of compost, and let winter do the rest. If you have chopped leaves, add them, too, prefer- ably beneath the compost. In spring, dig in\u2014you'll nd rich soil. Avoid pruning woody plants in fall; it triggers a rush of new growth that frost will zap. Prune perennials after a hard freeze. Leave at least 3 inches of stalk to protect crowns through winter freeze-thaw cycles. Apply mulch after the ground freezes. It's okay to spread wood ash on planting beds except around acid-loving plants, such as azalea or rhododendron. Clean and store patio furniture, umbrellas, and summer toys. Clean grills and move them closer to the house, if possible, for convenient winter cooking. LAWN Mow until turf stops growing. Make your last cut of the season an inch lower than normal and use a grass catcher attachment. This snips weed seed heads and removes them from the lawn. Aerate lawns; overseed to thicken turf. Apply a pre-emergent her- bicide now to control weeds next spring\u2014unless you plan to over- seed. Winterizer fertilizers for cool-season grasses enhance root growth. winter green, overseed warm-season turf with ryegrass. When mowing season ends, run the gas out of the mower. Change the oil, check the engine, and pull and inspect the spark plug. Before replacing the plug, dribble several drops of ve-weight oil into the hole and pull the start cord a few times. This lubricates the engine and wards off rust. Sharpen the blade now, and your mower is good to go next spring\u2014all you'll have to do is add gas. Service your snow- blower to ensure an easy start when the snow fl ies. 1 2 3 43season s / hy-vee.com 43season s / hy-vee.com$5.00 OFFRUG DOCTOR RENTAL Limit (1) offer with coupon.

Recently diagnosed diabetics often believe that normal eating \"has come to an end\" and that they will be \"tortured\" as they try to gure out what they can and cannot eat, according to Julie McMillin, R.D., at Hy-Vee in Ankeny, Iowa, and formerly at the Milan, Illinois, store. Instead, after working with her or one of the other 90 on-staff Hy-Vee dietitians, Julie says diabetics nd that they can continue to eat many of their favorite foods as they gain control of their diabetes. \"They are surprised at how easy it really is to choose the right foods,\" she says. Living with diabetes requires education, which Hy-Vee dietitians, often in partnership with Hy-Vee pharmacists, are trained to provide. More than once, Julie has found a recently diagnosed diabetic\u2014or parent of a diabetic child\u2014confused and wandering the aisles of her store searching for optimal food choices. She immediately provides basic help with shopping, then invites the patient and family to make an appointment for more assistance. Most Hy-Vee dietitians offer personal nutritional counseling for a small fee, as well as free group seminars and shopping tours. Personal sessions generally include obtaining a health history, calculating calorie and carbohydrate needs, creating a personalized meal plan, and discussing food choices and health concerns. On a diabetic store tour, dietitians take customers through the entire store, aisle-by-aisle, showing how to read labels and putting the Bountiful Health information into context. \"One of the hardest things for our customers is to avoid getting in a rut with the foods they choose,\" Julie says. \"Besides helping them plan varied menu options, we help them realize that consistency of meal times and the number of carbohydrates per meal is important. They know after our sessions that they can't skip breakfast anymore.\" Dietitians also work with diabetic customers to begin a gradual exercise plan, offering ideas to work off a few calories. \"We always recommend that patients check with their physicians before beginning any new exercise routine,\" she cautions. Mabel Dimitroff, Milan, Illinois, is a diabetic customer who Julie assisted. \"I was 73 years old when I was diagnosed with diabetes and it was very hard to learn how to control it. I had no knowledge of what to do,\" Mabel says. After attending classes at Hy-Vee, she now controls her condition through diet. \"Julie taught me how to combine foods and exercise and how to substitute\u2014for example, which brand of chocolate milk is the best choice.\" During National Diabetes Month this November, Hy-Vee will offer blood sugar screening and workshops along with tours, recipes, food sampling, label-reading, and more at many stores. For more information or to nd a dietician, check local Hy-Vee stores or visit hy-veehealth.com Dietitian Near You.\" NOTE: Hy-Vee dietitians also are available to visit businesses and organizations to present speci cally designed nutrition programs. THE DIABETES EPIDEMIC \"It's important for everyone to know more about diabetes,\" says Julie McMillin. \"Twenty million Americans have diabetes now and six million of them don't yet know they have it.\" Many symptoms appear harmless and are often ignored, especially if only one is evident. Symptoms of diabetes may include frequent urination, excessive hunger or thirst, unexpected weight loss, fatigue, or irritability. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical, Julie says, to avoid or reduce severe complications\u2014heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, blindness, kidney disease, neuropathy, limb amputations, and death. As to why diabetes has become an increasing problem in our society, Dr. Michael Case Haub, PharmD, BC-ADM, Hy-Vee Pharmacy Manager and Diabetes Educator in West Des Moines, says that type 2 diabetes goes hand-in-hand with a high obesity rate, and being obese is a major risk factor for developing diabetes. Other risk factors for type 2 diabetes are heart disease and high blood pressure, with 40 percent of diabetics having increased blood pressure. Juvenile diabetes, or type 1 diabetes, is generally genetic or triggered by a stressor, such as pneumonia. There is some advance warning for type 2 diabetes. \"Fully 25 percent of Americans now have pre-diabetes, and that's why diabetes screenings are so important,\" Mike says. \"Interventions\u2014losing weight, choosing the right foods, making better lifestyle choices, even taking medications\u2014are proactive steps to preventing full-fl edged diabetes. Those steps are critical. Mike says that some studies show that poorly managed diabetes can shorten lives as much as 5 to 15 years. 47season s / hy-vee.com 47season s / hy-vee.com2 4 6 8 10 121 3 5 7 9 11 1.

As anyone who's had the fl u may attest, it's well worth the momentary pinprick to avoid the days, weeks, or months of misery. Contact your local Hy-Vee for information and schedules for receiving fl u shots. FLU SHOT PRIMER: SHOULD I GET A FLU SHOT THIS YEAR? For healthy people, getting a fl u shot is a preventive health measure. Check with your doctor rst if you are allergic to chicken eggs or if you have had a reaction to a fl u shot. If you are running a fever, wait until you are symptom-free. Children younger than 6 months should not get fl u s h o t s . WHEN SHOULD I GET A FLU SHOT? Timing is important. Generally, the best time is October through the end of November; any earlier and the immunity will wear off. As late as December, there are some bene ts, because the season strikes the Midwest about February. It takes approximately 2 weeks after vaccination before immunity is reached. WILL THERE BE A SHORTAGE OF FLU VACCINE THIS YEAR? This year, there should be an ample supply of the fl u vaccine. If there is a shortage, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) will provide guidelines and priorities for who should get a shot. DOES THE FLU SHOT VACCINE MAKE ME MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING THE FLU? No, the vaccine is an attenuated or \"killed\" virus. There is no risk of getting the fl u from the vaccine. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF THE SHOT? There is some evidence that getting a fl u shot decreases the risk of all upper respiratory ailments as much as 47%.

Hormel Always Tender\u00ae Marinated Pork Loin Roasts onion or country $4.88 each 52seasons / FALL 2007Grab your steins and ready your appetites\u2014Oktoberfest is just around the corner! Beginning in mid-September and extending through October, many sites around the world celebrate this fun-filled annual event. Bavarian-style food, beer, music, and entertainment\u2014set in the last days of summer and beginning of autumn\u2014attract thousands. Oktoberfest has roots in Munich, Germany, when, in 1810, Crown Prince Ludwig was wed to Princess Therese of Bavaria. The royal reception, scheduled five days after the wedding, was held in the meadow that became known as Theresienwiese, or Therese's Meadow. With the royal court and most of the citizens of Munich in attendance, the celebration was such a huge success that it's become a yearly event. Immigrants to the U.S. have invented their own versions of Oktoberfest\u2014and invited everyone along to the annual affair. So there's no need to travel far to be among the revelry; the Midwest is recognized for some of the best celebrations across the country. Whether or not you make it to a festival, plan to celebrate Oktoberfest with family and friends\u2014indoors or out\u2014making selections of food, beverages, and partyware from Hy-Vee stores. To recreate a meadow or street scene, set up tents with tables and benches.

Traditional food, most of it familiar, has changed little over the past 200 years. For appetizers, serve large pickles from a jar and fist-size crusty pretzels. Grilled pork loin for dinner will have mouths watering, and bright green Brussels sprouts and tangy German potato salad are authentic fare. Add flavorful bratwurst kabobs to the mix, and guests can stroll with food in one hand and a stein\u2014of cider or beer\u2014in the other. Oom-pah music is legendary and a must, so have some CDs playing nonstop to keep the party lively. Hand out kazoos for buzzing along or inventing new sounds. For the grand finale, gather everyone for The Chicken Dance, another tradition straight from Munich, which holds the world's record for largest number of guests performing at once.

We had hot coals, great food, and the truest fans a team could hope for. Then just before daybreak, who do you think pulled in next to us? You guessed it\u2014fans from the opposing team. Let the games begin. 54seasons / FALL 2007WRITTEN BY CRAIG S. BLACK PHOTOGRAPHED BY PETE KRUMHARDTCOLORS 55season s / hy-vee.comSINCE THE FIRST TAILGATE PARTY\u2014CONSIDERED TO BE THE 1869 CLASH BETWEEN RUTGERS AND PRINCETON IN NEW BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY\u2014STUDENTS, PARENTS, ALUMS, AND FOOD AND T-SHIRT VENDORS HAVE GATHERED OFF THE FIELD TO SOCIALIZE AND CELEBRATE. Most dedicated fans agree: Competition begins long before players run onto the field. Tailgating extends the game to the parking lot as fans boast to have the greatest team spirit, grandest spread, or the body most covered with paint. But tailgating is all about sharing and amplifying the whole experience with family and friends, and while tailgate games are about winning\u2014with fans playing competitive games, pitching tents, and bringing out the best food\u2014most of all they're about the fun. Red Team Menu Theme: Gourmet Fajitas Spicy Tequila Lime Chicken Kabobs or steak and shrimp on fl avored skewers, page 62 (to grill) Tortillas (wrap separately in foil to warm on grill) Hy-Vee Kitchen Red & White Tortilla Chips Fajita & chip toppings: shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, Minute Rice with lime and cilantro, jalape\u00f1o peppers Hy-Vee Kitchen Salsa and Salsa Hy-Vee Salad Bar Guacamole Hy-Vee Bakery Fresh Personalized Football Cookies (Box of extra cookies, see below and right , for a post-game treat!) Non-Alcoholic Pomegranate Margaritas Iced water and sodas 56seasons / FALL 2007How to up the game: COLOR COUNTS Before putting on your game face (literally, when face paint is involved), think about how school colors can be used to strengthen the visual message that your tailgate sends. If you have it, flaunt it! The Fan-tastic vehicle, that is. If you own a car, SUV, or pickup in the right color\u2014or better yet, have a big ol' fan bus\u2014use it. Once the car is parked, use window-paint markers for slogans and messages. Add banners, windsocks, flags, and balloons to make your rig look big and bold. Take along decorated cookies and cupcakes. Hy-Vee offers great-tasting bakery cookies and cupcakes; and, if you order in advance, they can even add names and numbers of favorite players or names of fans in your tailgate party. Nothin' sissy\u2014 but they are kinda pretty\u2014and they offer the promise of taking down a sweet tooth craving in a flash.

Hy-Vee offers just the right gear for guys and gals to head to the big game in super style. B A R E N E C E S S I T I E S Keep it chilled, baby, if you don't want to get a case of hot-weather blues. Use separate ice-filled coolers for meats, vegetables and fruit, and other foods and beverages. And keep a watch on items such as potato salad and other heat-sensitive foods to make sure that they stay icy cold. Have plenty of drinks on hand too because when the games get started, you're gonna need 'em. Take along two sets of grilling utensils: one set for raw foods and one set for cooked\u2014just to be on the safe side. Chairs. Prevent wearing food to the game by having enough seating for everyone to have a place to sit, at least while they're eating. Many lightweight folding chairs, that collapse to the size of a baseball bat, even have cup holders\u2014get them at Hy-Vee. Water, water, and more water. For drinking, clean-up, putting out fires\u2014you get the picture. Keep it clean and use several trash bags: one for trash, one for bottle-deposit containers, one or more for other recyclables. Napkins, paper towels, wet wipes. Boom box, CD player, radio, whatever gets your groove on, and extra batteries to ensure that the music continues as long as your gang does. 4 610 123 59 1121 87 58seasons / FALL 2007 1.

Snacking goes on before, during, and after the game, so don't be shy\u2014bring it on in a big way. Then for the trip home\u2014have more snacks. Bag in individual zip-close bags so snacks are easy to hold and carry. Game shoes aren't just for the guys on the field. Wear your most comfortable pair so you can move, stand, and walk in comfort. MAKE IT EASY Match drinks to weather. From ice-cold lemonade to steaming hot chocolate. Shop for pre-cooked foods and tailgate packages. Hy-Vee has a wide selection of prepared foods\u2014from cut-up veggies to kabobs. Hy-Vee also offers homemade salsas, dips, specialty chips, and other game-day fare. Save your energy for having fun on game day, and count on Hy-Vee to handle as much of the food preparation as possible. They're good at the tough stuff. If you have 'em, use 'em. Tables make many jobs easier, from prep to serving to clean-up. TAKE IT EASY On game day, get moving early for the best party spot. If the opposing team parks next to you, make it fun for everybody with friendly competitions and even a few prizes\u2014a free bottle of water, a cookie in the opposing team's colors, etc. Make a list and check it twice to guarantee you won't leave behind the charcoal or your mother-in-law\u2014at least you'll know if you left her. Check the weather forecast. Then pack for the best and worst: parkas, mittens, raincoats, umbrellas, and the sunscreen\u2014even in cold weather sunburns happen. EXPERT ADVICE FROM FOLK IN THE KNOW KRISTI JACKSON, CATERING MANAGER AT WEST DES MOINES \"Be as creative as you want without starting from scratch. \"You can buy items that have 90 percent of the work done; the other 10 percent allows you to be creative. For example, try the seven-layer Mexican dip and our red, white, or blue corn chips. We also make a wide variety of items\u2014including sandwich wraps, kabobs, and subs up to 6 feet long.\" JOHN OLSON, HY-VEE STORE DIRECTOR IN LAWRENCE, KANSAS, HOME OF THE JAYHAWKS \"To make it easy for everyone, serve food that can be eaten out of hand.\" AL DIX, STORE DIRECTOR IN IOWA CITY, HOME OF THE HAWKEYES \"A certain number of people never even see the game. At the Ohio State game, which was sold out, as many as 20,000 people stayed in the parking lot the entire game. A view from the press box showed TV screens glowing all over the place.\" So there you have it! Even if you don't get a ticket to the game, you can win at tailgating. Along with family and friends, you can all hear the roar of the crowd and the loudspeaker, as you interpret those outstanding and upsetting plays. Being in close proximity to the stadium pumps the action. Now get out there and make us proud\u2014you're a winner! 61season s / hy-vee.com 1.

Large-screen TVs, sleek and lightweight, are being toted to games so fans can stay up-to-the-minute on games around the country. 2. Ticketless tailgaters, who have no intention of attending the game, are on the scene for pre-game festivities, to watch the game on TV, or be part of a sold-out crowd. 3. Fricasseed foes to roast rivals. Spirited fans taunt opposing teams by grilling chickens and turkeys (dubbing them Cardinals or Eagles), or lamb kabobs (at a Rams' game). You get the idea! 4 . F l a g - fl y i n g to show team spirit, personalize the encampment, brag about your alma mater, and show friends the way back to camp at halftime and after the game. 5. Responsibility and reality. Alcoholic beverage consumption is waning; drinks are getting lighter. Many responsible revelers nd sparkling apple juice and sparkling lemonade just as festive, and with no painful after effects. Playing a Florida team? Squeeze some oranges. 6. Dramatic, thematic seasonal entertaining has made its way to the gridiron apron. During October, stadium parking lots look like pumpkin patches. In November, turkey-grilling whets appetites. All through December, trees and wreaths decorate parking stalls. 7. Gourmet grub is upstaging burgers and brats. 'Gaters are trotting out Brie, shrimp, and walleye\u2014and serving it on fancy tableware with linen napkins. The next development? How about sushi? It is nger food. 8. Half-baked ideas. Short on time for full-fl edged grilling? Purchase packs of partially cooked tailgate fare. Throw it on the smoker long enough to amp that just-grilled taste. 9. In-tents surroundings. In warm weather, screened tents and awnings protect tailgaters from sun and bugs. In true football weather, they keep revelers dry. If only they could keep out the cold! 10. Gas-powered blenders. Really! Pull a cord to start, just like a lawn mower or chain saw\u2014but much more fun.
