Complications include pneumonia, encephalopathy (a disease of the brain), seizures and even death (5). This list with examples includes diseases for which vaccines are included in the national immunisation programmes, and/or are given to persons considered to be at a higher risk of getting the disease. -------------------------------------------------------------------- References: (1) ECDC factsheet - Pertussis: [https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/pertussis/facts](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/pertussis/facts) [](/en/vaccination/benefits-vaccination-community) Benefits of vaccination for the community Find out how vaccines help reduce the spread of disease in communities, and help establish herd immunity.
