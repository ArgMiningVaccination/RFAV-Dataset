[NadjaLind.com](https://NadjaLind.com) Turning in, Vol. 18 - Out of Body Testimonials: \"I think Nadja is a genius, and her musical creations are among the best transformative audio technology I have ever experienced. I feel she puts a lifetime of work on herself and compassion into every bar, every note, every beat, every chord she creates. Not to be missed.\" John Dupuy (CEO of Integral Recovery\u00ae and iAwake Technologies and teaches at John F. Kennedy University) \"I listened to Out of Body (Delta version) The music took over my overactive mind right from the beginning! My attention got drawn to the sweeping sounds. Then the super relaxing pads took me on a fantastic fantasy journey. I didn't want it to end!\" Helmut Ebritsch (CEO Music Heaven, programmer, musician, master meditator) \"WOW! I am sooooo in love with your new Out of Body track. I was totally carried away. It felt like my breath was dancing with the music. Very, very powerful! I even had a feeling of being in love. It was a total trip. This is the strongest ambient I've ever experienced.\" Yasemin (photographer, mom, meditator) Are you ready to experience multidimensional states of boundless bliss? This very exclusive \"Turning In\" album is especially designed to dive even deeper than ever before. \"Out of Body\" is like a magic ride through your innermost wonderland of who you truly are and discover new realms of endless relaxation and receptivity. Each oceanic wave of this phenomenal, warm and soothing sound blanket draws you into deeper trancelike, limitless states and comforts you into an even stronger connection to your deepest truth. Imagine how it would feel like if all judgements, boundaries and self limitations easily just melted away like ice-cream in the sun of vast and epic sounds. The perfect prerequisite for change, transformation and attracting miracles and yet unknown ecstasy into your life. In addition the seamless infinity loop versions allow you to have extensive trance and out of body experiences and other altered states of your choosing. What's inside? This exceptional album of profoundly state-altering meditation music supports you through \"the miracle tone\" of 528 Hz Solfeggio frequency. It promotes dna-repair and accelerates transformation. In addition you can choose from three binaural frequencies alpha brainwaves to support more focus, vista and creativity. Theta brainwaves to promote easy access to your subconscious, reprogram outdated habits and renew yourself. Delta brainwaves to support deep restorative sleep and rejuvenation. Seamless loop versions for extended out of body experiences. While binaural beats and the gentle asmr tickles ideally work on headphones you can also listen to this phenomenal music on speakers and as background music. It still works through the sound composition itself and the underlying Solfeggio Frequencies. How I made this music: Creating a Turning In album is more like editing a full length feature film than creating a three minute song - and you will feel the difference. An album for the Turning In series takes me at least around four weeks of studio work and constant testing, tweaking and mixing. In order to be able to feel and fine-tune the effects that even the smallest little detail has on the listener's state of consciousness and energy, I have to be in a meditative state myself while working in the studio. This meditative music is designed for a certain intention: To open up and change certain states of mind and expand the listener's consciousness. It is essential for me to be in an equal state of consciousness during the process of composing and designing this particular music. Why? Because once you are in a super relaxed, receptive and expanded state you will feel and hear every little detail and the slightest unevenness can ruin the whole experience. Along the way I test the latest version of the meditation tracks countless times in full length. Then I also send it to other experienced meditators to get their feedback before finally finishing the tracks. It is a very slow and time consuming but yet VERY relaxing process for me. I absolutely love this work and I am keen to know what the sounds are doing for you. Your feedback is very appreciated.
