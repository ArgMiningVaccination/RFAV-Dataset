A second goal was to determine whether proxy reports of mistr eatment would yield prevalence estimates similar to those of older adult respondent s themselves, thereby demonstrating the validity of an alternate method of assessing elder mistreatment. Method Random Digit Dialing methodology was used to derive a nationally representative sample (based on age, race , and gender) of 5,777 older adults (target goal 4,000) and 813 proxy respondents (target goal 500) for this study. Participants were interviewed via telephone in English or Spanish about a variety of mistreatment types and mistreatment risk factors, in addition to questions regarding health, social support, and demographics. Specific elder mistreatment categories included emotional, physical, sexual, financial, and neglect. Results The cooperation rate was 69% for the sample. 60.2% of the older adults were women and 39.8% were men. The average age of respondents was 71.5 years (SD = 8.1) with a range of 60 to 97 years. Of the 5,777, about 57% were married or cohabitating, 12% were separated or divorced, 25% were widowed, and 5% were never married. Considering race in order of magnitude, about 85% indicated that they were White, 7% Black, 2% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, and the remainder chose not to identif y. Considering Ethnicity, 4.3% indicated that they were of Hispanic or Latino origin. In addition to factors such as race and gender, the study sample was also characterized in terms of important contextual risk factors that might serve to increase or decrease risk of elder mistreatment, yiel ding the following risk factor information: low household income (i.e., less than $35,000 per year combined for all members of the household) was reported by 45.7% (2,262); being unemployed or retired was noted by 80.9% (5,174); poor health was self reported by 22.3% (1,279), a prior traumatic event (defined below) was reported by 62.0% (3,566) . Another 43.6% (1,379) indicated that they currently felt that they had very low levels of social support. Fully 40.8% (2,329) used social services of some form, and 37. 8% (2,176) reported that they needed some assistance with activities of daily living (ADL ). In order to simplify analyses, we also dichotomously grouped participants into two age groups: 'younger old' age 60 to 69 (49.9% of the sample), and 'older ol d' age 70+ (50.1%, of the sample). Past-year prevalences were as mistreatment: sexual mistreatment: exploitation by family: 5.2%. Lifeti me financial exploitation by a stranger was also obtained: 6.5%. Considering only emoti onal, physical, sexual, and potential neglect (i.e., excluding financial mistreatment), 11% reported at least one form of past year mistreatment, 1.2% reported 2 or more forms of past year mistreatment, and 0.2% reported 3 forms of mistreatment. In contra st to expectations, proxy reports were not useful in identifying mistreatment, with t he exception of family-member perpetrated financial exploitation. Thus, alternative methods of mistreatment prevalence estimation will need to be developed for community residing, cognitively impaired older adults. Overall, the elder mistreatment assessm ent strategy used in this study proved extremely effective in detecting all forms of abusive behaviors.

A second goal was to determine whether proxy reports of mistreatment would yield prevalence estimates similar to those of older adults respondents themselves, thereby demonstrating the validity of an alternate me thod of assessing elder mistreatment (for example, in cognitively impaired older adul ts who could not participate in survey research). We obtained the following past-y ear prevalences: emotional Li fetime financial exploitation by non-family was: 6.5%. Method We used Random Digit Dialing methodology to derive a nationally representative sample (based on age, race, and gender) in order to measure elder mistreatment in the US community-residing population. We exceeded our recruitment goals by almost 50%. Specifically, we interviewed individual s from 6,590 randomly selected households. Of these households, interviews were collected fr om 5,777 older adults (target goal 4,000), and 813 individuals who lived with or cared for older adults, here classified as 'proxy' respondents (target goal 500). Participants were interviewed via telephone in English or Spanish about a variety of mistreatment types and mistreatment risk factors, in addition to questions regarding health, social support, and demographics. Specific elder mistreatment categories included emotional, physical, sexual, financial, and neglect. Results The cooperation rate was 69% for the sample. 60.2% of the older adults were women and 39.8% were men. The average age of respondents was 71.5 years (SD = 8.1) with a range of 60 to 97 years.

In order to simplify analyses, we also dichotomously grouped participants into two age groups: 'younger old' age 60 to 69 (49.9% of the sample), and 'older ol d' age 70+ (50.1%, of the sample). No differences were observed based on Hispanic ethnicity in any mistreatment type. However, there were differences bet ween Whites and Non-Whites on measures of Physical Mistreatment, and this dichotomous variable is included in all univariate analyses below. Emotional Mistreatment Approximately 4.6% of adults over age 60 reported experiencing some form of emotional mistreatment in the past year, and only 8% of these individuals reported the event to the police. This contrasts wit h a prevalence of 9% reported by Laumann, Leitsch, and Waite (2008) in their recently co mpleted nationally representative sample of older adults for what they called 'verbal mistreatment.' Exhibit 1: Elder Mistreatment for Both Past Year and Since Age 60 Time Frames 14% 5% 2%2% 0% 1%5% 5%7% 0.0%4.0%8.0%12.0%16.0%20.0% Emotional Physical Sexual Neglect Financial Family Financial StrangerSince Age 60 Past Year / Current Lifetime Comparison of our definition of emotional mistreatment with their definition of verbal mistreatment explains part of this discrepancy, as their definition was somewhat liberal, and defined by a 'yes' response to the question \"Is there anyone who insults you or puts you down?\" When considering our more conservative definitions (see full report), the lower estimates in our study are t herefore not surprising. As with all forms of elder mistreatment, strangers were not usually the perpetrators. In stead, perpetrators were known to their older adult victims, and were family members in more than half the cases. Among known perpetrators, about a fifth were abusing substances around the time of mistreatment, and the same proporti on had some form of mental illness. Almost This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.half the perpetrators were unemployed and socially isolated. These emotional mistreatment perpetrator characteristics appear to define a group of individuals with limited social resources who are often in need of services to reduce substance abuse increase employment, and deal with ongoing em otional problems. These perpetrator deficits may present targets for interv ention which have the secondary benefit of reducing elder mistreatment. Exhibit 2: Perpetrators of Most Recent Emotional Mistreatment Event P artner/S pous e 25%Ref u sed 9%St r a n ge r 9% Ot h er relative 13% Ch i l d r e n / Gr a n d 19%Acquaintance 25% The 'younger old', here defined as below age 70, were at 3 times the risk of emotional abuse than those over age 70. This is consistent with recent findings of Laumann et al. (2008) and in contrast to earlier findings that our 'oldest old' are at increased risk of mistreatment (Tatara, 1997), but this difference may be due to the fact that we did not include any institutionaliz ed older adults (a group over-represented by the 'oldest old') or their representatives in our study sample. The fact that most abusers were known to the victim indicates that this form of mistreatment is probably part of a long-term pattern of interaction between these individuals, and probably began prior to older adulthood. Also at a three-fold elevated risk were those older adults reporting very low social support. The risk of negative outcomes associated with low social support is a theme echoed across mistreatment types, and speaks to the importance of considering an older adult's connection and utilization of co mmunity and interpersonal resources to prevent mistreatment. Risk was doubled for i ndividuals who needed assistance in daily life activities and in those with prior traum atic event experiences. The greater need for help and assistance of some older adults in accomplishing everyday activities appears to elicit verbal abusiveness from caregivers. While older theories of caregiver stress as a causative factor in elder mistreatm ent have been debated (Wolf, 1988; Bristowne & Collins, 1989; Homer & Gilleard, 1990; Pille mer & Suitor, 1992), some indirect and This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

A final interesting finding regarding elder emotional mistreatment was the risk associated with being employed, a risk main tained even after the effects of other variables were controlled. Note that this does not mean that em otional mistreatment occurred at work per se , however, these data do indicate that this possibility should be explored, and if observed, interventions to reduce workplace mistreatment of older adults developed. Physical Mistreatment The prevalence of elder physical mistreat ment was 1.6%. This prevalence is 8 times higher than that detected by Laumann et al. in their nationally representative study (0.2%) and speaks to the methodological sensitivity of our assessment strategy. The aforementioned study asked only one question (\" Is there anyone who hits, kicks, slaps, or throws things at you?\" ) with no contextually orienting preface statements. By contrast, our questions were structured to build on research with younger adults which revealed that survey respondents have a tendency to underreport 3 types of events: those they did not report to police, those that were not perpetrated by strangers, and those that happened more than a year ago. Thus, early research with younger adults (Kilpatrick et al., 1992) demonstrated that it is necessary to include a contextually orienting preface statement to frame mist reatment questions so that respondents are 'primed' to report non-stereotypic events; in other words: those perpetrated by non- strangers, over a year ago, that were not reported to police. Ironically, these are the majority of events. The differences in pr evalence rates between our study and that of Laumann et al. highlights the need for this type of assessment strategy. In this sample, fully 31% reported physical mistreatment to police. Strangers accounted for only 3% of physically assaulti ve behavior, compared to 76% for family members, indicating that any intervention to prevent this form of elder mistreatment must be directed at domestic relationships, and should probably borrow heavily from domestic violence research with younger adults. Perpetrators of physical assault were more likely to be abusing substances at the time of assault than those of emotional abuse, and were more likely to have histories of mental illness. Rates of unemployment and social isolation approximated those of em otional mistreatment perpetrators. Taken together, it appears that perpetrators of ph ysical assault are frequently a socially and vocationally dysfunctional group of individuals. While these are significant problems, clear targets for intervention along these lines can be derived. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Thus, as with emotional mistreatment, efforts should be directed towa rd increasing older adult's social support, perhaps in the form of maximizing their connection with and utilization of community- based resources. This would have the potent ial effect of not only reducing elder mistreatment, but also building resiliency against a variety of other negative health and mental health outcomes previously linked to low social support (e.g., Acierno et al., 2004). Sexual Mistreatment The rate of reported sexual mistreatm ent was very low, with less than 1% of respondents reporting this type of mistreat ment in the past year. Unfortunately, contemporary comparison with ot her elder mistreatment surveys is not possible, as Laumann et al. did not collect sexual mistreat ment data. Approximat ely 16% of victims reported sexual mistreatment to police; which is a somewhat higher reporting rate than that observed in younger adults (Kilpatrick et al., 1992), despite fact that majority were perpetrated by family members (52%) relative to strangers (3%). The finding that older adults appear to be more likely to report this form of mistreatment than younger adults is a positive one only when considering reporting rates of one age group relative to the other. On the other hand, fully 85% of ol der adults who are sexually mistreated do not report the event to police or other authorities. Family members were responsible for about half of the reported sexual mistreatments, with par tners and spouses specifically accounting for 40%. This echoes rates and distributions noted in younger adul ts, and indicates that a significant proportion of sexual mistreatment of older adults is a form of domestic violence.

As with most forms of elder mistreatment, individuals wit h low social support were more likely to report that they experienced sexual abuse, as were those who experience prior traumatic events. The conti nuing importance of perceived social support to the health and well being of older adults is consist ently reinforced by the present study. Neglect Potential neglect (defined here as instanc es where an older adult identified a specific essential need that was not being me t; but did not necessarily indicate that anyone had been designated to meet that need) wa s reported by 5.1% of respondents. (Laumann et al. did not collect neglect data, and comparison rates are not available). Potential neglect was independently predicted by a large number of risk factors in multivariate analyses, indicating multiple potential causal pathways, or, alternatively, multiple pathways for intervention. Spec ific risk factors included belonging to a non- white racial group, lower income, poor health, and low social support. These risk factors appear to point to a need to enhance the overall level of, and connection with community resources for older adults as perhaps the most appropriate and effective way to detect and prevent neglect.

Not surprisingly, older adults who were somewhat functionally impaired, as evidenced by their need for assist ance with activities of daily living, were most at risk. Disconcertingly, older adults w ho used social services were more likely to be financially mistreated, perhaps indicating that interaction with service providers somehow failed to act as a barrier against financial exploitation by family members, despite the increased potential for detection. Lifetime financial exploitation by strangers (about 6% of the sample), usually in the form of fraud, is a form of mistreatm ent operating via very different mechanisms than that perpetrated by family members. As su ch, it carried with it slightly different risk and protective factors. For example, financia l exploitation by strangers was not affected by older adult social service interaction. Not surprisingly, older adults with functional impairment, defined either as needing assistanc e with activities of daily life and poor health, were more likely to be targets of st ranger-perpetrated financial exploitation. More difficult to explain is the finding that y ounger older adults, and older adults with prior traumatic experiences, were also at incr eased risk for financial exploitation. With respect to the latter risk factor, it may be the case that the neighborhood or community level variables associated with traumatic ev ents are the same as those associated with stranger perpetrated fraud, however, we did not collect data to identify these common linkages, and given the finding that prior expos ure to traumatic events predicted many forms of elder mistreatment, this might be an area worthy of study.

These proxy reporters were included to determine if prevalences of reported elder mistreatment would be similar to thos e reported by the older adults themselves. If this were the case, an alternative method for assessing elder mistreatment (e.g., in cognitively impaired older adults) would be identified (institutionalized older adults will require an entirely separate form of asse ssment methodology based on sentinel and technological reports; see the work of Lachs et al. in progress). Although prior studies (e.g., Pillemer and Finkelhor, 1988) indicated t hat proxy reports might actually be more sensitive to detecting elder mistreatment than older adult respondent reports, this finding was largely not supported here, with t he exception of family-member perpetrated financial exploitation. For other abuse types, proxy reports produced significantly lower estimates of emotional mistreatment, physi cal mistreatment, sexual mistreatment, neglect, and financial exploitation by strangers than did respondent reports. Thus, alternative methods of mist reatment prevalence estimation will need to be developed for community residing, cognitively impaired older adults. Summary Overall, the elder mistreatment assessm ent strategy used in this study proved extremely effective in detecting all forms of abusive behaviors. This finding is strongly supported when contrasting this study's pr evalence estimates to those derived from another nationally-representative study on t he same age cohort conducted at roughly the same time by Laumann et al. (2008). The present study found past year prevalences of 4.6% for emotional mistr eatment (compared to 9% by Laumann et al. who used an extremely liberal, single question assessment of 'verbal' mistreatment); 1.6% for physical mistreatment (compared to 0.2% by Laumann et al.), 0.6% for sexual mistreatment (not measured by Laumann et al.), and 5.1% for potential neglect (not measured by Laumann et al.). Consideri ng only emotional, physical, sexual, and potential neglect (i.e., excluding financial mist reatment), 11% reported at least one form of past year mistreatment, 1.2% reported 2 or more forms of past year mistreatment, and 0.2% reported 3 forms of mistreatment.

It is rarely reported, and even less frequently acted upon in criminal justice settings. Most emotional abusive events are 'legal' and, though cruel, lack any criminal justice system remedy. Th is virtually assures its sustained frequency. Emotional mistreatment of older adul ts in the workplace may be more common than we predicted, as employ ed older adults reported more of this for of abusiveness. This, together with the first point seems to indicate a general societal acceptance of this behavior. Relative to the general population, it appears that perpetrators of emotional physical and sexual mistreatment have high unemployment, increased substance abuse, and incr eased likelihood of mental health problems. Particularly striking was the older adult report that perpetrators of mistreatment were socially isolat ed, having fewer than three friends in about half of all the cases in which perpetrators were known. These perpetrator deficits may present tar gets for intervention which have the direct corollary benefit of reducing elder mistreatment. Prevalence of financial exploitation is extremely high, with 1 in 20 older adults indicating some form of perceived financial mistreatment by family members occurring at least one time in the recent past. Specific resources and civil remedies should be directed to ward this type of mistreatment (e.g., dedicated prosecutors of financ ial mistreatment in geographic regions with high numbers of older adults). Financial exploitation by family me mbers and by strangers was increased among the more physically disabled adults, indicating perhaps a greater need for monitoring for this subgroup of elders. Use of social services does not seem to be associated with lower levels of familial financial mistreatment and pot ential neglect, and has little effect on the more 'typical' forms of emotional , physical, and sexual mistreatment, indicating a 'missed opportunity' for intervention and a need for training in awareness and intervention among social service staff. Low income, poor health, and low social support all independently predict neglect and point to a deficit in community connection and resources in this population. Enhanced monitoring to assure that older adults, particularly non-white older adults, are not falling victim to neglect is necessary, as is increased attempts to 'reconnect' isolated older adults to their community. Social support has emerged as a central risk or protective factor for virtually all forms of elder mistreatment. Moreover, prior research indicated that social support is linked to improved health and mental health. Programs that enhance and build relati onships between older adults and members of their community, that is , programs that act against the age- This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

A second goal was to determine whether proxy reports of mistreat ment would yield prevalence estimates similar to those of older adult respondents t hemselves. If so, then an alternate method of assessing elder mistreatment (for example, in cognitively impaired older adults who could not participate in survey research) w ould be established. We used a multi-method assessment strategy to measure elder mistreatment, and exceeded our recruitment goals by almost 50%. Specifically, we in terviewed individuals from 6,590 randomly selected households. Of these households, interviews were collected from 5,777 older adults (target goal 4,000), and 813 individuals w ho lived with or cared for older adults, here classified as 'proxy' respondents (target goal 500). Goals and Objectives 1. To implement a population-based study methodology, previously validated by our research group for use with younger populat ions, with a sample of community residing older adults. 2. To augment this methodology with an alternative method of assessment of caretakers for those non-institutionally -based elders with significant cognitive impairment. 3. To incorporate methodological refinement s to assessment of elder mistreatment specifically informed by our National Inst itute on Aging pilot assessment study with older adults. 4. To document prevalence and characterist ics of risk factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of experiencing various forms of mistreatment. 5. To use the knowledge gained about the scope, intensity, and character of elder mistreatment, including risk and protective factors, to inform public policy and community based interventions to reduce elder mistreatment and its negative effects. Background Prior Prevalence Estimates The National Center on Elder Abuse collects data on reports made to Adult Protective Service agencies (a very limit ed 'snapshot' of a much larger elder abuse problem), and shows a dramatic increase in documented cases of assault and violence by caretakers against the elderly. Despit e these high numbers, only one other large scale population-based, nationally-represent ative sample of older adults has been directly studied (Laumann et al., 2008), and the pr imary purpose of that study was not to assess elder mistreatment. When non-random samples of older adults have been directly studied with respect to mistreatment, sampling was limited to specific This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

That is, the existing national st udies either did not actually interview older adults themselves, or did not have as their central focus elder abuse; and the existing large-scale interview study on elder mistreatment did not assess a national sample. Consequently, comprehensive incidence, prevalence, outcome, and risk data are limited. The National Elder Abuse Incidence Study (NEAIS) (Tatara, 1997) sponsored by the Administration for Children and Families and the Administration on Aging confined its data sources to Adult Protective Service reports and reports of trained \"sentinels\" in the community of substantiated or \"presumed\" substantiated cases, but did not interview older adults themselves. Data were gather ed on domestic (i.e., non-institutionalized) elder abuse and neglect cases from a nationally representative sample of 20 counties in 15 states. Reports from APS agencies were considered only when substantiated, and reports from sentinels were \"presumed to be substantiated.\" The median age of victims was 77.9 years. Women were over-repres ented, particularly in instances of psychological abuse. Another disproportionatel y affected group was the oldest old (80+ years), who experienced abuse at two to thr ee times their proportion of the older adult population. Several characteristics of perpetrators were also identified. Aggressors were more often men, younger, substance abusers, and related to victims. Consistent with previous studies, children/spouses were the most frequent perpetrators. There are some limitations to this study: first, t here was no direct assessment made of the population in question, and second, two different sources of abuse report data were used. These sources of data produced very different estimates of abuse rates and demographic characteristics of victims, i ndicating potential problems with reliability and validity, or in the least, problems with met hodological sensitivity in one or both data sources. This problem is amplified by the fact that the topic of study, victimization, is an event that is tremendously under-reported. Indeed, victims of abuse actively avoid disclosure of these events to APS agencies. Overa ll, it is very likely that estimates from this study greatly underestimate the true sc ope of the problem of elder abuse because a great majority of cases go both unreport ed and undetected by monitoring agents. In the second major investigation of elder abuse, Pillemer and Finkelhor (1988) directly studied over 2,000 older adults in the Boston metropolitan area, but did not assess elders from other geographic locations. Extrapolated data from this study indicated that approximatel y 1,000,000 older adults had experienced physical or severe emotional abuse since age 60. Specifically, 2% of the sample reported physical abuse and 1.1% reported verbal abuse. Only about 1 in 14 cases of elder abuse were brought to the attention of authorities. Spouses and children were the primary perpetrators of elder abuse, and, in so far as statistical risk determination is concerned, spouses and children were equally likely to be abusers. Instances of abuse perpetrated by a spouse or a child did not appear to differ in terms of re sultant injury, level of distress, or severity of violence enacted (Pillemer & Finkelhor, 1988). As noted by Pillemer, recognition of high rates of spousal elder abuse has contri buted to the conceptualization that this crime is more analogous to domestic violence than child abuse. Other investigators have also conducted preliminary studies of elder abuse, however, the majority were conducted 2 - 3 decades ago. Podnieks, Pillemer et al. (1989) conducted telephone interviews wit h a random sample of 2,000 elderly Canadians and found that 0.5% suffered physical abuse and 1.4% emotional abuse since age 60. In a random sample of New Jersey older adults, Gioglio and Blakemore (1982) reported an abuse rate of about 1%. In a sample of Maryland elders, Block and This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Sinnott (1979) found an abuse rate of 4.1%. Considering clinic populations: Homer and Gilleard (1990) studied respite care patient s and caregivers in England and found that 45% of caregivers admitted either verbal ( 41%) or physical abuse (14%). Interestingly, frequency of patient reports of abuse was less than that of caregivers. Finally, in a record review study of 404 patients from a chronic illness center, Lau and Kosberg (1979) observed abuse symptoms in 9.6% of the sample. The most recent study in which el der mistreatment was assessed (as a component of a larger study) was report ed by Laumann, Leitsch, and Waite (2008), and used a nationally representative random samp le. This study assessed 3,005 individuals aged 57 to 85 for past year physical, verbal , and financial mistreatment. Two-thirds were interviewed in person, and the remaining third completed a 'leave behind' booklet of questions. Sexual mistreatment and neglect were not assessed. Prevalences for past year mistreatment were as follows: 9.0% fo r verbal; 0.2% for physical, and 3.5% for financial. Subsequent risk factor analyses were confined to only those mistreatment episodes perpetrated by family members. 'Younger' older adults were more likely to experience verbal and financial mistreatmen t. Women were more likely to experience verbal mistreatment and Afri can Americans were more likely to report financial exploitation, with Latinos less likely than ot her ethnicities to report either form of victimization. Older adults with physical vul nerabilities were more likely to experience verbal abuse, and those with poor reported health were more likely to experience financial abuse. A Conceptual Model of Elder Mistreatment: The Ecological Model A theory-driven approach is essential to di recting researchers to those empirical questions of greatest relevance to a given t opic, and to effectively integrating basic research with intervention strategies (Pillemer, Suitor, & Wethington, 2003). The Ecological Model (See Bronfenbrenner, 1997), as outlined and applied to older adults by Schiamberg and Gans (2000) and applied by our assessment battery, addresses four nested systems: the microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Briefly: with the individual as the referent point, one's family represents the microsystem. The relation between family and other immediate settings (e.g., institutional or informal support systems) forms the mesosystem. The exosystem encompasses environments removed from the elder individual, but withi n which the family members (microsystem members) interact (e.g., family member 's place of employment), and hence are indirectly connected with the older adult. The macrosystem includes the values, norms and State or institutional patterns of a cu lture. These systems and their relation with one another can change over time (chronosystem). Application of the Ecological Model of Elder Mistreatment The dependent measures found in the battery for the present study reflect specific assessments relative to the topic of elder mistreatment, including neglect and exploitation by trusted others, at each leve l of the older adult's ecological system. The majority of individual items were directed to ward microsystem factors; a focus that is justified given the early nature of the res earch. That is, the characteristics of the microsystem within which elder mistreatment occurs were necessarily central to this initial research in this area so that future efforts can be directed to relevant areas of This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.larger nested systems. This ordering is nec essary because, by definition, larger systems encompass an increasingly greater num ber of variables, the definition and measurement of which are progressively mo re complex. Thus, as an early national study of elder mistreatment, our focu s must be on the microsystem, with thought directed to likely aspects of larger syst ems. Consequently, much of the research directed by the ecological microsystem involved specification of event prevalence and assessment of risk factors. Microsystem variables found in our assessment battery included factors previously identified as asso ciated with risk of various forms of elder mistreatment, such as age, gender, living arrangement, marital status, race, health status, substance abuse, and social isolation. Microsystem variables are also reflected by the victimization and life stress queries. The next nested level, encompassing micr osystem variables, is the mesosystem. This system refers to relationships and factors in the lives of the older adults' significant others, most importantly caretakers, who share their environment, usually spouses and adult children living in the residence. Im portantly, many ethnic and race-based influences will be felt at the level of the me sosystem. Moreover, we begin to assess the structure of the mesosystem in terms of t he significant other's vocational and social support network, general reported level of stress, and social isolation. Directly related to and encompassing the mesosystem is the ex osystem. As mentioned, the exosystem refers to those areas of significant others' lives that are removed from the older adult respondent, but may indirectly influence the older adult. This then leads to questions regarding the ultimately encompassing macrosystem, which includes the culture and community environment in which the other systems reside. Thus, exosystem variables related to elder mistreatment include querie s regarding post-victimization contact with authorities, involvement with courts, or ot her experiences that represent the nested connection of smaller systems with larger ones , in this case State service agencies, criminal justice system agencies, or local community agencies. Moreover, exosystem assessment includes discussion of contacts wit h professionals who may, as a virtue of their professional interaction with the significant other, play a part in the victim's life. For example, we assessed whether or not the older adult's abuser was receiving counseling services. If, for example, an adult child living in the older adult's household receives counseling from a psychologist or social worker and reveals he is engaging in elder abuse, the counselor would then be mandated to in volve social services in many states. Thus, the respondent's child's counselor (mesosystem) would engage the state social services (exo- and macrosystem) which would have a direct impact on the older adult respondent's life (microsystem). Risk Factors for Elder Mistreatm ent (Microsystem / Mesosystem Level) Early research on elder abuse risk factors highlighted caregiver stress and 18 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Al so implicated were theories involving resentment of the parent or violence pa ssed down through generations. More recent research has found \"little support for the 'e xternal stress' or of violence' theories\" (p 759, Wo lf, 1988). Instead, specific factors related to caregiver personality and residential contex t are associated with increased risk of abusive behavior. These caregiver characteristics include mental disorders, substance use, social isolation, and dependency on the older adult (Bristowne & Collins, 1989; Homer & Gilleard, 1990; Pillemer & Suitor, 1992). In contrast with early predictions, degree of the elder's physical disability or dependency, or even external stress (e.g., financial difficulty) does not consistently increase the likelihood that abuse will occur. Rather, stress appears to affect the intens ity, not likelihood of perpetrated abuse. Characteristics of older adults that seem to increase the risk of being abused include abuse in young adulthood, alcoholism, advanced age, and provocative behavior (Coyne & Reichman, 1993; Pillemer & Suitor, 1992). C ontextual factors include social or geographic isolation, and income. Specifica lly, 5.7% of women in households with incomes below $10,000 were victimized in 1992 (i ntimates were responsible for almost 40% of these victimizations) compared to 3.8% of those in households earning $20,000- $29,000. Methodological Concepts in Assessing In terpersonal Violence in Older Adults There are two major points to consider when interviewing older adults: relative to younger adults, older adults evince a greater reluctance to disclose interpersonal problems of the past or present, and their ver bal reports are more affected by physical factors (e.g., fatigue, hearing difficulty) (Ouslander, 1984; Patterson & Dupree, 1994). With respect to the first point, older adults who have been abused or assaulted by family members may be unlikely to report these event s for a variety of reasons. Many older adults feel responsible, at least in part, for their adult children's' abusive behavior because they \"taught them to be that way.\" That is, they blame their own parenting style for their adult child's behavior. Older adults may also feel extremely embarrassed that their offspring or spouses are abusing them and that they ar e powerless to stop the abuse. They may be very motivated to hide this powerlessness, both out of pride, and in order to deny any physical or cognitive declines associated with aging. Older and younger adults also report that simply being stigmatized or labeled as a victim is aversive, particularly in instances of sex ual assault (Kilpatrick, Edmunds, & Seymour 1992). As with younger victims of domestic violence, abused older adults may fear retribution or more intense assaultiveness from the perpetrator or other abusive parties. Many financially or physically dependent older adults also face the very real fear that if the perpetrator is arrested or removed fr om the household following disclosure, they may be institutionalized or lose other freedom s. Finally, older adult victims may care deeply for, or love the perpetrator, and may want to avoid hurting or embarrassing the perpetrator in any way through reporting the event. 19 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. With respect to the second factor m entioned above, physical health barriers to communicating about victimization include deficit s in cognitive functioning, hearing loss, increased susceptibility to fatigue, inability to remain sitting for extended durations (e.g., due to arthritis), and effects of medicati on on concentration and memory. Other factors to consider when assessing older adults in clude ageism, interview stress, increased somatic presentations that may mirror p sychopathological symptoms, increased time needed to build trust and rapport, and increased medication use. Focusing on specific behaviors and events during assessment (e.g., using very clear, specific descriptions of behavioral events, rather than culturally -defined phrases) appears to be an objective means by which to limit these problems, and, as illustrated by our pilot study, is the essential methodological strategy to increase sensitivity and accuracy of abuse assessment (Acierno et al.,1997; 2003). The following is a description of a succe ssful application of the aforementioned methodological considerations, driven by the Ecological Theory and conceptualization of elder mistreatment. 20 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The survey was administered via Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (C ATI) script, and contained two separate interviews. The base interview was designed to be used directly with adults age 60 years or older. The second, or proxy interv iew was designed to be used with individuals who lived with an older adult age 60 + (and may or may not fulfill caretaker duties) ( Appendix B ). Given that the quota for proxy interv iews is set at approximately 11% of the total sample, screening questions and algorithm s were built into the first part of the script to identify households with elder adults, and determine who would be interviewed (adult or proxy). Whenever an index older adult (index defined as that person over age 60 who most recently had a birthday) was judged to be potentially unable to give informed consent (very liberally defined) the default response was to conduct a proxy interview. A proxy was defined as someone who lived with an adult over age 60, at least part of the week. The proportion of older adul t vs. proxy interviews was continually examined to maintain the 9:1 ratio. Both interviews covered the following topics (with the exception of Recent Health, which was only asked of the older adult respondents): Recent Health of the adult 60+ (adult interview only) Prior Traumatic Stressors of the adult 60+ Social support available Emotional Mistreatment of the adult 60+ Physical Mistreatment of the adult 60+ Sexual Mistreatment of the adult 60+ Financial Exploitation of the adult 60+ Neglect of the adult 60+ Household Demographics A pretest was conducted among 200 households. The results of the pretest were used to determine the average length of the call which was 16 \u00bd minutes. As one might expect, the length of the call tended to be longer for respondents who reported more incidents of mistreatment. The average call length did not very as a function of who was interviewed (Adult = 16:31, Proxy = 16:41). Target Population Based on the Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, it was estimated that approximately 26% of households in the U.S. would have an adult over the age of 59 living at the residence. The number of those who will be impaired (i.e., unable to participate in the interview) was much smaller. Therefore efforts were made to ensure that at least 10% of the surv eys were completed by proxy in the final 21 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The full scale test targeted a total of (n = 6,500) completed interviews, thus the proxy target was at least 650. Sample Construction Most of the statistical formulas associated with sampling theories are based upon the assumption of simple random sampling. Specifically, the statistical formulas for specifying the sampling precision (estimates of sampling variance), given particular sample sizes, are premised on simple random sampling. Unfortunately, random sampling requires that all of the element s in the population have an equal chance of being selected. Since no enumeration of the to tal population of the United States (or its subdivisions) is available, all surveys of the general public are based upon an approximation of the actual population and su rvey samples are generated by a process closely resembling true random sampling. The survey samples were based on a modified stratified random digit dialing (RDD) method, using an area probability/RDD sample rather than a single-stage/RDD sample. There are several important advantages to using an area probability base: (1) it draws the sample proportionate to the geographic distribution of the target population rather than the geographic distribution of telephone households, which is vital to constructing unbiased population estimates from telephone surveys; (2) it allows greater geographic stratification of the sample to control for known geographic differences in non-response rates; and (3) it facilitates the use of Census estimates of population characteristics to weight the completed samp le to correct for other forms of sampling and non-sampling bias. Moreover, the precision of sample estimates is generally improved by stratification. Thus the sample was first stratified by time zone within the continental United States (Eastern, Centra l, Mountain and Pacific) to better reflect population densities within each region. Once the sample had been geographically stratified with sample allocation proportionate to population distribution, a sample of assigned telephone banks was randomly selected from an enumeration of the Working Residential Hundreds Blocks of the active telephone exchanges within the region. The Working Residential Hundreds Blocks were defined as each block of 100 potential telephone numbers within an exchange that included 3 or more residential listings. (Exchanges with one or two listings were excluded because in most cases such listings represent errors in the published listings). The sampling frame for working hundreds blocks in all surveys using random digit dialing is restricted to land-li ne telephones since there are no public listings of cell phones. Further, federal law prohibits the use of auto-dialers in calling of cell phone numbers. Hence, any known cell phone banks and numbers ported from land- line to cell phone are systematically excluded from the RDD land-line samples. 22 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.In the third stage sample, a two-digi t number was randomly generated by computer for each Working Residential Hundr eds Block selected in the second stage sample. This third stage sampling process is the RDD component. Every telephone number within the Hundreds Block has an equal probability of selection, regardless of whether it is listed or unlisted. The th ird stage RDD sample of telephone numbers was then dialed by SRBI interviewers to determine which were currently working residential household phone numbers. Non-working number s and non-residential numbers were immediately replaced by other RDD numbers se lected within the same stratum in the same fashion as the initial number. Ineligible households (e.g., no adult in the household, language barriers other than Spanish) were also immediately replaced (e.g., eliminated from the denominator of the response rate). Non-answering numbers were not replaced until the research protocol was met. Household Screening The sample construction process yielded a population-based, RDD sample of telephone numbers. The systematic dialing of those numbers to obtain a residential contact yielded a random sample of telephone households. The next step was to select eligible households within the total sample of working numbers. An adult respondent at each number drawn into the sampling frame was contacted about the composition of the household. Telephone numbers that yiel ded non-residential contacts such as businesses, churches, and college dormitories, were screened out. Only households, i.e., residences in which any number of related individuals or no more than five unrelated persons living together, were eligible for inclusion in the sample. This minimal screening was only to ascertain that t he sample of telephone numbers reached by interviewers was residential households. Respondent Selection The multi-stage sampling process described in the previous sections yielded a random national sample of households wit h telephones, drawn proportionate to the population distribution. The final stage required the selection of one respondent per household for the interview. A systematic sele ction procedure was used to select one designated respondent for each household sampled. First, the total number of age- eligible adults in the household was ascertained from a household informant. If there was only one eligible adult in the household that individual was the designated respondent. The \"most recent/next birthday method\" was used for within household selection among multiple eligibles. The most recent/next birthday procedure has been widely used for two decades because it permits unbiased systematic selection without requiring full household enumerati on (Salmon & Nichols, 1983). As previously stated, in cases where t here was even the slightest indication that an elder adult respondent was cognitively impaired, the interviewer attempted to use a 23 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.proxy respondent. If the impaired older adult lived with more than one other person, the proxy was identified as the person living in the household who is closest to, or spends the most time with the adult. If the older adult lived alone, a proxy could be identified if they had face to face contact with the adult on a regular basis, that is, at least every other day. NOTE: As mentioned, proxy respondent s were also sought in order to main the 9:1 proportion outlined above. Thus, the pr oxy selection procedure was also applied to a random selection of households where the elder adult was not impaired to ensure there was enough proxy interviews in the completed sample to make meaningful comparisons. Phoning Procedures Initial telephone contact was attempted during the hours of the day and days of the week that have the greatest probab ility of respondent contact. The primary interviewing period was from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on weekdays, from 9:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturdays, and from 10:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Sundays (all are local time). Since interviewing was conducted across time zones, the interviewing shift lasted until 12:30 a.m. Eastern Time (9:30 p.m. Pacific Time). Contact Attempts If the interview was not conducted at the ti me of initial contact, the interview was rescheduled at a time convenient to the respondent. Although initial contact attempts were made on evenings and weekends, daytime interviews were scheduled when necessary. If four telephone contacts on the night and weekend shifts did not elicit a household contact, the fifth contact was attempted on a weekday during the daytime. Interviewers attempted a minimum of 10 calls to each telephone number to reach a household. When the household was reached, the interviewer asked to speak to an adult to screen the household for eligibility and to determine the designated respondent. When the designated respondent was reached but an interview at that time was inconvenient or inappropriate, interviewe rs set up appointments with respondents. When contact was made with the household, but the designated respondent was not available, interviewers probed for appropr iate callback times for an appointment. Once a household had been reached, up to 15 call back attempts were made to interview the designated respondent. These addi tional contact attempts were set to occur every 47 hours unless a scheduled callback was made with a respondent. Additional daytime contact attempts were made, along with nights and weekends. Additional answering machine messages we re left periodically during the extended callback period. Although the maximum number of contact attempts was 25 according to the study protocol (10 to reach a household and 15 to interview the designated 24 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.respondents), additional callbacks were m ade if requested by the designated respondent. The contact protocol specified that t he fifth call to reach a household be made during weekdays. Messages were left on the answering machine on the sixth, eighth and tenth calls, if an answering machine was encountered on those attempts. The answering machine message explained that the household had been selected to take part in a National Survey of Adults being c onducted by the Medical University of South Carolina and the National Institute of Justice. Households were also given the opportunity to call in to Abt SRBI's to ll-free number to schedule the interview ( Exhibit 1 ).

We are looking forward to talking with you. Thank you and have a great day. Spanish Language Interviews Spanish language versions of the survey instrument was developed in order to eliminate language barriers for the Spanish speaking proportion of the U.S. adult population ( Appendix C ). If the interviewer encountered a language barrier at the telephone number, either with the person answering the phone or with the designated respondent, the interviewer thanked the pers on and terminated the call. If the household was designated as Spanish language household, it was assigned to a Spanish-speaking interviewer. These bilingual interviewers re-contacted the Spanish-speaking households to screen for eligibility and conduct interviews with eligible respondents. Refusal Minimization The initial contact with the household and the designated respondent is crucial to the success of the project. Most refusals take place before the interviewer has even completed the survey introduction. Numerous studies have shown that an interviewer's approach at the time of the first contact is t he single most important factor in convincing 25 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.a respondent to participate in a survey. Many respondents react more to the interviewer and the rapport that is establis hed between them than to the s ubject of the interview or the questions asked. This positive first impression of the interviewer is a key to securing the interview. In the initial telephone cont act, the interviewer immediately established the following: A positive impression that he or she wa s a friendly, responsive professional person; The ways in which the survey was important to the respondent; and, What was expected of the respondent. The survey introduction included the following: The interviewer's name; Who they were calling for; What they were doing; and That they wanted to ask the res pondent questions about their experiences. While the brief introduction to the study concerning its sponsorship, purpose and conditions was sufficient for many respondents, some had questions and concerns during the interview. All respondent questions were answered clearly and simply. Interviewers were trained to answer respondent questions without prompt or biasing respondents' answers. Most importantly, interviewers had to appear willing to answer all questions in an open, positive and confi dent manner, so that respondents were convinced of the value and legitimacy of the study. If respondents appeared reluctant or uncertain, Abt SRBI's toll-free number was provided to verify the authenticity of the survey. Field Outcomes The field interviewing commenced on Febr uary 6, 2008, following training of the field interviewers. The sample was comple ted on September 9, 2008. A total of 6,589 interviews (8,134 by proxy) were conducted for the National sample. The final average interview length was approximately 15 minutes. Phone Dispositions There were a total of 275,909 numbers used for the national sample. Of these numbers 157,793 were not eligible for the st udy, 32,699 were of unknown eligibility and 38,682 were eligible but not interview ed. Among the 46,735 households that were 26 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.systematic and unbiased procedures, the achieved sample is determined by the proportion of the drawn sample who are reached and who are able and willing to participate in the study. To the extent t hat those who are reached and those who are willing to participate are different from those who are not reached or unwilling to participate, the achieved sample will differ from the population from which it is drawn. The cooperation rate represents a measur e of potential sample bias because it indicates the degree of self-selection by potent ial respondents into or out of the survey. The cooperation rate is calculated as the number of completed interviews, including those that screen out as ineligible, divided by the total number of completed interviews, terminated interviews, and refusals to interview. It should be noted that the inclusion of screen outs in the numerator and denominator is mathematically equivalent to discounting the refusals by the estimated rate of ineligibility among refusals. The response rate for the survey is based on the following elements: completed interviews; partial interviews; screen outs; refusals; and non-contacts. The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) cooperation rate 3 was 69% for the national sample.

Sample Weighting The characteristics of a perfectly drawn sample of a population will vary from true population characteristics only within certain limits of sample variability (i.e., sampling error). Unfortunately, social surveys do not permit perfect samples. The absence of perfect cooperation from sampled units m eans that the completed sample will differ from the drawn sample. In order to correct these known problems of sample bias, the achieved sample is weighted to certain c haracteristics of the total population. The weighting plan for the survey was a two-stage sequential. The first stage in the sample weighting procedure was designed to correct for procedures that yielded unequal probability of selection within sampled households. Although the survey was designed as a population survey, only one eligible person per household could be interviewed (because multiple interviews per household are burdensome and introduce additional design effects into the survey estimates). A respondent's probability for selection is inverse to the size (number of other eligible adults) of the household. Hence, the base weight was equal to the number of eligible respondents within the household. The second step in the weighting process was to correct the study design for non response bias by dividing the expected population distribution, based on Census projections, by the base-weighted sample distribution for age and gender. Specifically, the post-stratification weight corrected the sample to the cell distribution of the population for the eight separate age groups ( 60-61, 62-64, 65-66, 67-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84 and 85 or older) by gender using the 2000 Census Population estimates for Age and Sex. Notes on Precision of Sample Estimates and Statistical Procedures The objective of the sampling procedures used on this study was to produce a random sample of the target population. A random sample shares the same properties and characteristics of the total population from which it is drawn, subject to a certain level of sampling error. This means that with a properly drawn sample we can make statements about the properties and characteristics of the total population within certain specified limits of certainty and sampling variability. The confidence interval for sample estimates of population proportions, us ing simple random sampling without replacement, is calculated by the following formula: 29 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

In Exhibit 4, the expected size of the sampling error for specified sample sizes of 12,000 and less, at different response distributions on a dichomous variable are presented. As the t able shows, larger samples produce smaller expected sampling variances, but there is a constantly declining marginal utility of variance reduction per sample size incr ease. Expected standard errors will also fluctuate with the scale of the variable being measured. One might expect slight decreases in precision as the scale of measurement becomes more complex. 30 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Sampling Error for the Present Study For the present study, the sampling error was less than +/- 0.56% for all mistreatment outcomes. Estimating Statistical Significance for Sampling The estimates of sampling precision pr esented in the previous section yield confidence bands around the sample estimate s, within which the true population value should lie. This type of sampling estimate is appropriate when the goal of the research is to estimate a population distribution parameter. However, the purpose of some surveys is to provide a comparison of population parameters estimated from independent samples (e.g. annual tracking surveys) or between subsets of the same sample. In such instances, the question is not simply whether or not there is any difference in the sample statistics that estimate the population parameter, but rather is 31 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.the difference between the sample estimates statistically significant (i.e., beyond the expected limits of sampling erro r for both sample estimates). To test whether or not a difference between two sample proportions is statistically significant, a rather simple calculation can be made. The maximum expected sampling error (i.e., confidence interval in t he previous formula) of the first sample is designated s1 and the maximum expected sampling error of the second sample is s2. The sampling error of the difference between these estimates is sd and is calculated as: ) 2 1 ( sd2 2s s+ = Any difference between observed proportions that exceeds sd is a statistically significant difference at the specified confi dence interval. Note that this technique is mathematically equivalent to generating standardized tests of the difference between proportions. Variable and Risk Factor Definitions In addition to general demographic variabl es, the following elder mistreatment variables were collected: emotional mist reatment, physical mistreatment, sexual mistreatment, financial exploitation, and neglec t. Specific risk factor analyses were also conducted using the following variables, also collected in this survey: income, employment status, health status, experience of prior traumatic events, social support, utilization of social services, required a ssistance with activities of daily living. Operational definitions of these key study variables are given below. Moreover, for emotional, physical, sexual, and neglectful mi streatment, participants were asked how long ago each of these items happened most recently, and whether they happened since they were 60 years old. For familia l financial mistreatment, participants answered in terms of 'current' status. For stranger perpetrated financial mistreatment, participants answered in terms of lifetime status. Emotional Mistreatment Emotional mistreatment was defined as an affirmative answer to any one of the following four questions. After it was dete rmined that such an event had occurred, the timing and characteristics of the event (e.g., perpetrator status, reporting to police, time frame) were defined. \u0083 1. \"Now we want to ask you about some things that people in your life might do that make you feel bad, such as saying very mean things to you, or being rude to you. A lot of people say this happens to them, and we really need to find out how often it happens. Sometimes, we call these things emotional mistreatment. The person who 32 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Has anyone ever verbally attacked, scolded, or yelled at you so that you felt afraid for your safety, threatened or intimidated?\" \u0083 2. \"Has anyone ever made you feel humiliated or embarrassed by calling you names such as stupid, or telling you t hat you or your opinion was worthless?\" \u0083 3. \"Has anyone ever forcefully or repeatedly asked you to do something so much that you felt harassed or coerced into doing something against your will?\" \u0083 4 \"Has anyone close to you ever completely refused to talk to you or ignored you for days at a time, even when you wanted to talk to them?\" Physical Mistreatment Physical mistreatment was defined as an affirmative answer to any one of the following three questions. As was the case with emotional mistreatment, descriptive parameters of the event were collected when respondents indicated that such an event had occurred. \u0083 1. \"Another type of stressful event that people sometimes experience is being physically hurt by another person. The pers on doing these things could be a romantic partner, spouse, family member, friend, or someone who helps take care of you. Has anyone ever hit you with their hand or objec t, slapped you, or threatened you with a weapon?\" \u0083 2. \"Has anyone ever tried to restrain you by holding you down, tying you up, or locking you in your room or house?\" \u0083 3. \"Has anyone ever physically hurt you so that you suffered some degree of injury, including cuts, bruises, or other marks?\" Sexual Mistreatment Sexual mistreatment was defined as an affi rmative answer to any one of the following three questions. After it was determined that such an event had occurred, the timing and characteristics of the event (e.g., perpetrato r status, reporting to police, time frame) were defined. \u0083 1. \"I am going to ask you questions about unwanted sexual advances that you may have experienced over your lifetime. Peopl e do not always report such experiences to the police or discuss them with family or friends.

You may not need help with any of these things, and if that is the case, just feel free to tell us you don't need this type of help. Some older adults do need help with these things, so it's important for us to ask. Do you need someone to help you get to the places you need to go, for example do you need someone to drive you to t he grocery store, a place of worship, the doctor?\" \u0083 2. \"Do you need someone to make sure you have enough food, medicines or any other things you need in your house?\" \u0083 3. \"Do you need someone to help you with household things, like cooking meals, helping you eat, or making sure you take the correct medicines each day?\" \u0083 4. \"Do you need someone to help you with house cleaning or yard work?\" \u0083 5. \"Do you need someone to help you get out of bed, get showered, or get 34 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Is there someone who helps you take care of your finances, or is there someone other than yourself who makes decisions about your money and your property, either with or without your approval?\" \u0083 2. \"Does that person ask for your PERMISSION before deciding to spend your money or sell your property?\" \u0083 3. \"Do you feel like that person makes good decisions about your finances?\" \u0083 4. \"Do you have the copies of paperwork for the financial decisions they make or can you get copies if you wanted them?\" \u0083 5. \"Has that person ever forged your signature without your permission in order to sell your property or to get money from your accounts?\" \u0083 6. \"Has that person ever forced or tricked you into signing a document so that they would be able to get some of your money or possessions?\" \u0083 7. \"Has that person, or anyone else you ar e close to, ever stolen your money or take your things for themselves, their friends, or to sell?\" \u0083 8. \"Has a stranger ever spent your money or sold your property without your permission?\" \u0083 9. \"Has a stranger ever forged your signature in order to get some of your money or sell your property?\" \u0083 10. \"Has a stranger ever forced or tricked y ou into signing a document so that they would be able to get some of your money or possessions?\" Income (Normal vs. Low) 35 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. Low income was defined as cases where the entire household income was less than $35,000 the previous year. Employment Status (Yes vs. No) Employment was defined as working full or part time, in the military, or enrolled as a student at the time of the interview. Health Status (Good vs. Poor) Health status over the prior mont h was assessed using the general health question number 1 from the World Health Organization Short-Form 36 Health Questionnaire (Ware & Gandek, 1988). Participants were asked to rate the following question: \"In general, would you say your health is \"Excellent, Very good, Good, Fair, or Poor.\" These responses were dichotomized into Poor Health (self rating of fair or poor) and Good Health (self rating of excellent, very good, or good). Experience of Prior Traumatic Events (Yes vs. No) Participants were asked to report if they had been exposed to the following events and indicated fear that they would be killed or seriously injured during this exposure: natural disasters such as earthquake, hurric ane, flood, or tornado; serious accident at work, in a car, or somewhere else; or bei ng in any other situation where you thought you would be killed. Social Support (High vs. Low) Perceived social support during the past month was assessed via a modified five- item version of the Medical Outcomes Study module for social support (Sherbourne & Stewart, 1991). Participants were asked about emotional (e.g., \"someone available to love you and make you feel wanted\"); instrumental (e.g., \"someone available to help you if you were confined to bed\"); and appraisal (e.g., \"someone available to give you good advice in a crisis\") social support and responded to items using a four-point scale from \"none of the time\" to \"all of the time\" (sample range=0-20; M=15.8 [ SD=4.0]). Low social support was operationalized as a score in the lower quartile of the sample ratings, and the comparison high social support was operationalized as a score in the upper quartile of sample ratings. Use of Social Services (Yes vs. No) 36 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. Participants were asked if they had used any of the following programs or services: senior centers or day programs; physical rehabilitation; meals on wheels or any other meal service, social services or health services provided to the home; hospice; formal senior friends services, chur ch group home visits, any other program or service. Assistance Required with Activities of Daily Living (Yes vs. No) Participants were asked if they needed help from time to time with the following activities: shopping for groceries or medici nes; going to the doctor, transportation to friends, church or temple, paying bills or doing related paperwork, taking medicines, getting dressed, bathing, and eating. Data Analysis and Statistical Plan Two-tailed bivariate 2 analyses were performed to examine mistreatment risk in relation to demographic variables, health ra tings, social support, social services utilization and previous traumatic stressor exposure experiences. Next, all of the demographic variables, as well as risk variables that reached a cutoff of p < .05 in bivariate analyses were examined with respect to their relative risk of each mistreatment type in separate logistic regression analyses with set a priori at p < .05. 37 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Additional data for the Proxy st udy were provided by 813 individuals who lived with or cared for an individual age 60 years or higher. 60.2% of the older adults were women and 39.8% were men. The average age of respondents was 71.5 years (SD = 8.1) with a range of 60 to 97 years. Of the 5,777, about 57% were married or cohabitating, 12% were separated or divorced, 25% were widowed, and 5% were never married. Considering race in order of magnitude, about 85% indicated that they were White, 7% Black, 2% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, and the remainder chose not to identif y. Considering Ethnicity, 4.3% indicated that they were of Hispanic or Latino origin. These distributions are within 1% of US Census data for all major categories (White, Black, Hispanic). In addition to factors such as race and gender, the study sample was also characterized in terms of important contextual risk factors that might serve to increase or decrease risk of elder mistreatment, yi elding the following information: low household income (i.e., less than $35,000 per year) was reported by 45.7% (2,262); being unemployed or retired was noted by 80.9% (5 ,174); poor health was self reported by 22.3% (1,279), a prior traumatic event (def ined above) was reported by 62.0% (3,566). Another 43.6% (1,379) indicated that they curr ently felt that they had very low levels of social support. Fully 40.8% (2,329) used social services of some form, and 37.8% (2,176) reported that they needed some assistance with activities of daily living (ADL). In order to simplify analyses, we also di chotomously grouped according to 'younger old' age 60 to 69 (49.9% of the sample), and 'ol der old' age 70+ (50.1%, of the sample). No differences were observed based on Hispanic ethnicity in any mistreatment type. However, there were differences bet ween Whites and Non-Whites on measures of Physical Mistreatment, and this dichotomous variable is included in all univariate analyses below. Emotional Mistreatment Overall prevalences for emotional mistreatment are given in Exhibit 5 in terms of events occurring over a lifetime, since age 60, and in the past year time frames. Limiting discussion to the past year prevalence, about 5% of older adults indicated that they had recently experienced some form of em otional abuse. Proportions of respondents endorsing specific subtypes isolation. Only 7.9% of incidents were reported to police. 38 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

This may be because respondents were more confident in rating whether an event occurred in the past year as opposed to ratings of whether it occurred since age 60 or before age 60. Exhibit 6 gives the distribution of perpetrator status for emotional mistreatment. Note that strangers accounted for only about 8% of recent emotional mistreatment episodes, compared to 25% by romantic part ners / ex partners, and 18% by children or grandchildren and the rest by acquaintances . Clearly, emotional abuse is an event perpetrated by known individuals who are unlik ely to be confronted for their actions by police or other authorities.

Individual analyses of hypothesized risk factors produced the following list of events and situations that increased likelihood of reporting that emot ional mistreatment had occurred: being younger than age 70, havi ng experienced a prior traumatic event, reporting poor health, requiring assistance with ac tivities of daily living, and having low social support. Surprisingly, being unemployed was associated with reduced risk of emotional mistreatment.

Lower age rema ined strongly predictive of increased reports of emotional mistreatment, with individuals below age 70 more than 3 times more likely to indicate that they had experienced this event in the past year. The experience of a prior traumatic event wa s also associated with increased risk of mistreatment, a finding also observed in the literature on younger adult mistreatment. This indicates that there may be some s hared variance between causes of emotional abuse and traumatic life events. On the most obv ious level, interpersonal environments characterized by exposure to traumatic ev ents are probably more likely to contain emotionally abusive individuals. Conceptually c onsistent with this point was the finding that Low social support was equally predictiv e of increased risk, even after controlling for the effects of all other variables. Be ing unemployed continued to be associated with reduced risk, and this indicates that perhaps a significant amount of emotional mistreatment against older adults is occurring in the workplace. Finally, older adults who need help with activities of daily living we re also at increased risk of emotional mistreatment, even after all other factors were controlled. However, the risk associated with this factor was relatively lower than t hat of the other factors, arguing against the conventional wisdom that mistreatment re sults in large part from caregiver burden associated with high demand characteristics of needy older adults. Physical Mistreatment Overall prevalences of physica l mistreatment are given in Exhibit 10 . Lifetime prevalence was 12%, past-year prevalence wa s 1.6%. Considering individual physical mistreatment types, about 1.2% reported bei ng hit, 0.4% reported being restrained, and 0.7% were actually injured during the even t. Approximately 31% of these events were reported to police. 42 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Following the aforementioned data analytic plan, physical mistr eatment risk factors that reached statistical significance in univariate analyses were entered into a logistic regression to examine relative risk. Only lower age and low social support remained significant predictors of physica l mistreatment when effects of all other risk factors were considered simultaneously. Being under 70 incr eased risk four-fold, while having low social support tripled risk.

Nonetheless, our sample size was sufficient to detect some instances. Overall prevalences of sexual mistreatment are given in Exhibit 15 . Lifetime prevalence was 7.0% and past year prevalence was 0.6% . Past year prevalence for specific subtypes were as follows: approximately 0.4% reported forced sexual intercourse, 0.2% reported molestation, 0.1% sa id that they were forced to undress against their will, and 0.1% reported that they were phot ographed in the nude against their will.

Subjecting these st atistically significant predictors of risk to multivariate analyses (Exhibit 19) in which the relative effects of each risk factor were controlled, only prior experience of traumat ic events and low social support remained predictive of sexual mistreatment, with prior trauma increasing risk 14-fold, and low social support increasing risk by a factor of almost 6.

Moreover, the category has also been expanded by some researchers to include self-neglect. In this study, we focus on potential neglect where a need has been identified but there may not be anyone available to help meet this need, and neglect by an identified caregiver, where a specific person or set of persons are expected to help address this need. Overall prevalences of current neglect are given in Exhibit 20. Potential neglect over the pas t year was reported by about 5.1% of respondents, whereas neglect by an assigned caregiver was noted by 0.5%. 48 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Naturally, this falls on family members most of the time, who ma y or may not be geographically proximate to the older adult, and who may or may not have any fiduciary responsibility in the eyes of local civil statutes. Note that the sample size for this subgroup was extremely small (n = 27), nonetheless, partners were considered negligent in about a 28% of identified cases, compared to 39% of cases for children or grandchildren and 23% for acquaintances. 49 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Univariate analyses indicated that being female, a member of a minority racial group, having lower income, being unemployed, having poor health, having experi enced a prior traumatic event, having low social support, non-use of social services, and needing help with activities of daily living all greatly increased risk of potential neglec t (the final risk factor was completely expected, as only those individuals indicati ng that they needed help with activities of daily living could actually be in need of assi stance, that lack of which would be defined as neglect. Multivariate analyses ( Exhibit 24 ) in which effects of each risk factor were controlled for every other risk factor showed that risk of potential neglect continued to be predicted by minority racial status, low income, poor health, and low social support. Low social support increased risk by a factor of 4, whereas the other risk factors nearly doubled likelihood of reporting potentia l neglect. For identified neglect ( Exhibit 25 ), multivariate analyses revealed that only poor health was a unique risk factor 50 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Financial Mistreatment In this section we discuss separately episodes of financial mistreatment perpetrated by family and by strangers. Note also that only current assessment of financial mistreatment by family members, and lifetime mistreatment by strangers was conducted. Prevalence of financial mistreatment perpetrated by family members ( Exhibit 26 ) was 5.2%, making this a relatively frequently occurring type of elder mistreatment by trusted others. About 20% of these events involved spending money without the elder's permission, 3% indicated that the trusted family member did not make good decisions regarding their finances, 4% reported that t hey were not given copies of financial transactions, 3% stated that their signature wa s forged, 2% stated that they were forced to sign something against their will, and 4% repor ted that their money was simply stolen by a family member. 53 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

If this were demonstrated to be the case, then a new method of estimating the prevalence of older adult mistreatment, particularly in those older adults with cognitive deficits such as dementia, would have been validated. This methodology was pursued because early research (e.g., Pilleme r & Finkelhor, 1988) indicated that proxy reporters were more likely to uncover mistreatment ev ents than the victims themselves. Our findings were mixed with respect to th is issue, with proxy reports useful for identifying physical and financial mistreat ment, but not emotional or sexual mistreatment, or neglect. The following sect ion describes prevalence estimates from proxy reports for elder mistreatment, with gr aphical juxtaposition of reports from the older adults themselves.

Unfortunately, most forms of elder mist reatment were not adequately detected by proxy reports. The exception to this finding was for Financial Mistreatment by Family members, for which proxy reports produced higher prevalences. Overall, for both past year, and since age 60 time frames prox y reports produced significantly lower prevalence estimates for emotional mistreatment, physical mistreatment, financial exploitation by strangers, and potential neglect. These findings are illustrated graphically in Exhibits 32 and 33.

This contrasts with a prevalence of 9% reported by Laumann, Leitsch, and Waite (2008) in their recently completed nationally representative sample of older adults for what they called 'verbal mi streatment.' Comparison of our definition of emotional mistreatment with their definition of verbal mist reatment explains part of this discrepancy, as their definition was somewhat liberal, and defined by a 'yes' response to the question \"Is there anyone who insults you or puts you down?.\" Lower estimates in our study are therefore not surprising. As with all forms of elder mistreatment, strangers were usually not the perpetrators. Instead, perpetrators were known to their older adult victims, and were family mem bers in more than half the cases. Among known perpetrators, about a fifth were abusing substances around the time of mistreatment, and the same proportion had some form of mental illness. Almost half the perpetrators were unemployed and socially is olated. These emotional mistreatment perpetrator characteristics appear to define a group of individuals with limited social resources who are often in need of services to reduce substance abuse increase employment, and deal with ongoing emotional problems. These perpetrator deficits may present targets for intervention which have the secondary benefit of reducing elder mistreatment. The 'younger' old, here defined as below age 70, were at 3 times the risk of emotional abuse than those over age 70. This is consistent with recent findings of Laumann et al. (2008) and in contrast to earlier findings that our 'oldest old' are at increased risk of mistreatment (Tatara, 1997), but this difference may be due to the fact that we did not include any institutionalized ol der adults or their representatives in our study sample. The fact that most abusers were known to the victim indicates that this form of mistreatment is probably part of a l ong-term pattern of interaction between these individuals, and probably began prior to older adulthood. Also at a three-fold elevated risk were those older adults reporting very low social support. The risk associated with low social support is a theme echoed across mistreatment types, and speaks to the need for consideration of an older adult's connection and utilization of community and interpersonal resources to prevent mistreatment. Risk was doubled for individuals who needed assistance in daily life activities and in those with prior traumatic event experiences. The greater need for help and assistance of some older adults in acco mplishing everyday activities appears to 62 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.elicit verbal abusiveness from caregivers. While older theories of caregiver stress as a causative factor in elder mistreatm ent have been debated (Wolf, 1988; Bristowne & Collins, 1989; Homer & Gilleard, 1990; Pille mer & Suitor, 1992), some indirect and limited support for this presumption is given here for emotional mistreatment (but not for physical or sexual mistreatmen t, or neglect, as noted below). A final interesting finding regarding elder emotional mistreatment was the risk associated with being employed, a risk main tained even after the effects of other variables were controlled. Note that this does not mean that em otional mistreatment occurred at work per se , however, these data do indicate that this possibility should be explored, and if observed, interventions to reduce workplace mistreatment of older adults developed. Physical Mistreatment The prevalence of elder physical mistreat ment was 1.6%. This prevalence is 8 times higher than that detected by Laumann et al. (2008) in their nationally representative study (0.2%) and speaks to the methodological sensitivity of our assessment strategy. The aforement ioned study asked only one question (\" Is there anyone who hits, kicks, slaps, or throws things at you?\") with no contextually orienting preface statements. By contrast, our ques tions build on research with younger adults which revealed that survey respondents have a tendency to underreport 3 types of events: those they did not report to police, those that were not perpetrated by strangers, and those that happened more than a year ago. T hus, early research demonstrated that it is necessary to include a contextually orienting preface statem ent so that respondents are 'primed' to report non-stereotypic events, including those perpetrated by non- strangers, over a year ago, that were not reported to police. In other words, the majority of events. The differences in prevalence rates between our study and that of Laumann et al. highlights the need for this type of assessment strategy. In this sample, fully 31% reported physical mistreatment to police. Strangers accounted for only 3% of physically assaulti ve behavior, compared to 76% for family members, indicating that any intervention to prevent this form of elder mistreatment must be directed at domestic relationships, and should probably borrow heavily from domestic violence research with younger adults. Perpetrators of physical assault were more likely to be abusing substances at the time of assault than those of emotional abuse, and were more likely to have histories of mental illness. Rates of unemployment and social isolation approximated those of em otional mistreatment perpetrators. Taken together, it appears that perpetrators of ph ysical assault are frequently a socially and vocationally dysfunctional group of individual s. While problematic, clear targets for intervention along these lines can be derived. In terms of risk factors, only low age and low social support predicted physical mistreatment, but both of these did so at very high levels. Thus, as with emotional mistreatment, efforts should be directed towa rd increasing social support, perhaps in 63 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.the form of maximizing their connection with and utilization of community-based resources. This would have the potential effe ct of not only reducing elder mistreatment, but also building resiliency against a variety of other negative health and mental health outcomes previously linked to low social support (e.g., Acierno et al., 2004). Sexual Mistreatment The rate of reported sexual mistreatm ent was very low, with less than 1% of respondents reporting this type of mistreat ment in the past year. Unfortunately, contemporary comparison with ot her elder mistreatment surveys is not possible, as Laumann et al. did not collect sexual mistreat ment data. Approximat ely 16% reported to police; which is a somewhat higher reporting rate than that observed in younger adults (Kilpatrick et al., 1992), despite fact that ma jority were perpetrated by family members (52%) relative to strangers (3%). The findi ng that older adults appear to be more likely to report this form of mistreatment t han younger adults is a positive one only when considering reporting rates in relative terms. That is, fully 85% of older adults who are sexually mistreated do not report the event to police or other authorities. Family members were responsible for about half of the reported sexual mistreatment, with partners and spouses specifically accounting for 40%. This echoes rates and distributions noted in younger adults, and indi cates that a significant proportion of sexual mistreatment of older adults is a fo rm of domestic violence. The predictor set of risk factors for sexual violence was based on very small sample sizes, and risk ratios should be considered somewhat tentatively. As with most forms of elder mistreatment, individuals with low social support were more likely to report sexual abuse, as were those who experience prior traumatic event s. The continuing importance of perceived social support to the health and well being of older adults is consistently reinforced by the present study. Neglect Potential neglect (defined here as instanc es where an older adult identified a specific essential need that was not being me t; but did not necessarily indicate that anyone had been designated to meet that need) wa s reported by 5.1% of respondents. (Again, Laumann et al. did not collect negl ect data, and comparison rates are not available). Potential neglect was independently predicted by a large number of risk factors in multivariate analyses, indicati ng multiple potential causal pathways, or, alternatively, multiple pathways for interv ention. Specific risk factors included belonging to a non-white racial group, lower income, poor health, and low social support. These risk factors appear to point to a need to enhanc e the overall level of and connection with community resources for older adults as perhaps the most appropriate and effective way to detect and prevent neglect, a form of mistreatment that. 64 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Financial Exploitation Financial exploitation by family members in one form or another was present in over 5% of respondents, making this fo rm of mistreatment by trusted others unexpectedly common. Not surprisingly, older adults who were somewhat functionally impaired, as evidenced by their need for assist ance with activities of daily living, were most at risk. Disconcertingly, older adults w ho used social services were more likely to be financially mistreated, perhaps indicating that interaction with service providers somehow failed to act as a barrier against financial exploitation by family members, despite the increased potential for detection. Lifetime financial exploitation by strangers (about 6% of the sample), usually in the form of fraud, is a form of mistreatm ent operating via very different mechanisms than that perpetrated by family members. As su ch, it carried with it slightly different risk and protective factors. For example, financia l exploitation by strangers was not affected by older adult social service interaction. Not surprisingly, older adults with functional impairment, defined either as needing assistanc e with activities of daily life and poor health, were more likely to be targets of st ranger-perpetrated financial exploitation. More difficult to explain is the finding that y ounger older adults, and older adults with prior traumatic experiences, were also at incr eased risk for financial exploitation. With respect to the latter risk factor, it may be the case that the neighborhood or community level variables associated with traumatic ev ents are the same as those associated with stranger perpetrated fraud, however, we did not collect data to identify these common linkages, and, given the finding that prior ex posure to traumatic events predicted many forms of elder mistreatment, this might be an area worthy of study. Considering Risk Factors In addition to considering each form of el der mistreatment in terms of its risk factors as above, we next consider risk fa ctor in turn in order to more adequately identify patterns across mistreatment types. This is a useful endeavor when considering that risk of one form of mistreatment is increased in individuals who have experienced any other form of mistreatment. Age Lower age (between 60 and 70 years) increased risk of physical, emotional, and stranger-perpetrated financial mi streatment of older adults. Age was not related to increased or decreased risk of sexual abuse, fi nancial mistreatment by family members, or neglect. The fact that the 'younger old' were more likely to receive physical and emotional mistreatment is somewhat at odds with findings that the 'oldest old' are most likely to suffer mistreatment (Tatara, 1997). However, these conflicting results may be due to the fact that our study did not include institutionalized elderly, who are arguably 65 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.more vulnerable to mistreatment in terms of their inability to defend themselves due to physical frailty; or, in cases of cognitive im pairment, in terms of their inability to report the crime to authorities. [An interesting asi de related to mistreatment in institutional settings is provided by the data of Lachs & Pillemer (2004), who has recently noted that older adults in institutional settings are at tremendous risk of repeated violence perpetrated by other similarly impaired resi dents, and that this resident on resident violence is by far the most common type of elder mistreatment in these settings, indicating an essential problem in the institutional mileau]. Gender While female gender predicted sexual a ssault in univariate analyses, no form of mistreatment was associated with gender in multivariate regressions. This outcome was somewhat surprising considering the literat ure on risk factors for sexual assault of younger adults in which gender is the most pow erful predictor. However, risk of sexual assault in younger adults does decrease wit h age within females, and it may be the case that gender based differences are not obs ervable in individuals over age 60. On the other hand, these logistic regressi on analyses may well have been underpowered, and findings of no differences (i.e., findings in support of the Null Hypothesis) should be considered with great caution. Thus, what c an be said is that gender plays much less of a predictive role for mistreatm ent in older than younger adults. Racial Status At the univariate level, belonging to a non-white racial group was associated with increased risk of physical mistreatment, fi nancial mistreatment, and potential neglect. However, when effects of other risk factors were considered, minority racial status predicted only potential neglect. As mentioned, negl ect is different from other forms of mistreatment because it represents the absence of an act, rather than the presence of a malevolence. As such, it is not unreasonable to posit that individuals who may or may not be designated caretakers for an older adult may act in this caretaking role only if other responsibilities of a more imm ediate and apparent nature (e.g., childcare, employment) are met, and sufficient time and resources re main to both (1) detect that a particular older adult has an unmet need and then (2) act to fulfill this need. The increased risk of neglect in non-white older adults (and by connection, the increased risk of 'neglectful behavior' by their designated or undesignated caretakers) may indicate fewer resources available to their potential caretakers. This is consistent with research on community resources conducted by Galea et al. (2005) and indicates, perhaps, an increased need for extra-familial senti nel monitoring to detect neglect in this subgroup of minority older adults through increased community education, increased medical personnel training, and programs specifically designed to detect essential but unmet needs in older adults, such as expansi ons of the 'meals on wheels' programs. 66 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.[Note that the preceding discussion did not conc ern the resources of older adults, which are considered in the next paragraph and were independently related to neglect, over and above racial status.] Income Lower income (below $35,000 per year) was predictive of physical and sexual mistreatment and neglect when effects of ot her variables were not statistically controlled. However, in multivariate anal yses lower income was associated only with neglect. Findings regarding the effect of low income on neglect are not surprising, and further strengthen the notion that having only limited resources enhances potency of a variety of other risk factors to increase the likelihood that negative outcomes will befall older adults. The process by which limited re sources of the older adult (as opposed to those of their caretakers) increases likelihood of neglect is probably linked to the socially isolative effect of low income. This 'forced withdrawal' of an older adult with specific needs from social settings in wh ich these needs could otherwise be observed and acted upon is particularly disheartening when one considers that social isolation is also predictive of both medical and mental health problems. Neglect can be added to this list of negative outcomes for older adults who lack the resources (e.g., cab fare, automobile insurance, etc) to maintain soci al interactions and who then fall out of our awareness. Employment In many studies, either income or employment status, but not both, are assessed. However, in the present study we measured employment status in addition to income because we thought that in older adul ts employment preserves a connection to the community and its resources, and hence would be protective against neglect and perhaps other forms of mistreatment. This expectation was supported at the univariate level only for neglect. However, and quite against predictions, being unemployed was associated with reduced risk of emotional mistreatmen t. Given that the majority of emotional mistreatment is perpetrated by family members, we predicted that the workplace would be a 'refuge' from this type of abusiveness, but this was not the case. Note, however, that our assessment methodology did not specifically measure whether the reported emotional abusiveness was taki ng place at work. Thus, while being employed was independently predictive of emoti onal mistreatment, it does not directly translate that the mistreatment occurred at work. Older adults who are employed may be so out of necessity and financial dist ress, and may thus exist in environments conducive to verbally aggressive behavior. However, income was not predictive of emotional abuse, and mitigates somewhat this hypothesis. Further study of this finding is warranted. 67 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Health When effects of other risk factors were not considered, poor health was associated with every form of elder mistreatment. However, after effects of other risk factors were accounted for, poor health was uniquely associated only with financial mistreatment by strangers and potential neglect. The later finding is not surprising, given that in this study neglect and potent ial neglect was defined, in part by having unmet needs of a medical nature. Individual s in poor health will have proportionately greater numbers of needs and healthcare, and hence, proportionately greater numbers of unmet needs as well. Thus, it may be very useful to increase sentinel training for geriatricians in order to detect potential negl ect in their more medically compromised patients. The finding regarding increased lik elihood of financial mistreatment by strangers of the medically ill is particula rly disconcerting and morally repugnant. It is very likely easier to financially mislead or mistreat older adults who are either preoccupied with health related concerns , or significantly less able to defend themselves as a direct result of their health problems. The predatory nature of some individuals to exploit older adults is well doc umented by findings that this age group is the one most at risk of financial exploitation. This study indicates that those elderly in poor health are even more likely to be financially mistreated. Prior Traumatic Experience In this country, exposure to at least one traumatic events is actually a normative experience, with over 60% of the population reporting at least one such experience in their lifetime (Norris, 1992). Nonetheless, prior traumatic event exposure is an understudied risk factor in elder mistreatmen t. This position was strongly supported in the present study in that traumatic event experiences predicted all forms of elder abuse and neglect at the univariate level, and continued to predict emotional, sexual, and stranger perpetrated financial mistreatment when effects of other variables were controlled. This contextual risk factor appears to be a proxy for environmental risk, in that individuals who have experienced very traumatic events in the past may be more likely to remain in environments that facilit ate risk of current emotional, sexual, or financial mistreatment. This finding, combi ned with the findings regarding social support as a protective factor (see below), may indica te that the social environment is the most important target for intervention to prev ent many forms of elder mistreatment. Social Support Older adults who reported higher levels of social support were less likely to report all but one form of elder mistreatment (the exception was financial exploitation by family). When effects of other variables were held constant, high social support was protective against (and low social support was predictive of) emotional, physical, and 68 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.sexual mistreatment as well as neglect. This is an extremely important finding, particularly in light of data from other studies (e.g., Acierno et al., 2004) showing that social support is one of the strongest and most re liable predictors of risk or resiliency in older adults following stressful life events acro ss a variety of psychological outcomes, in addition to mistreatment. This is a relatively uncomplicated area of potential intervention for a variety of negative outcomes, and one that remains to be effectively exploited for the benefit of older adults. Indeed, many ri sk factors (lower income, poor health) may interact with low social support to greatly increase social withdrawal, leading to both increased risk of mistreatment and increased likelihood that this mistreatment will go undetected. Social Service Utilization We predicted that older adults who use social services would reduce their risk of all forms of mistreatment by placing themse lves in contact with professionals who (a) might be able to directly mitigate risk of mist reatment through provision of the services themselves (b) might indirectly reduce risk of mistreatment by presenting a potential risk of discovery to a perpetrator (c) might indire ctly reduce risk of one form of mistreatment by reporting another form of mistreatment to authorities. This prediction was not well supported, with the notable ex ception of reduced financial exploitation by family members of older adults who were 'connected' with social services. This is a disappointing finding and may indicate that soci al service providers require much more training in the detection of and intervention with elder mistreatment. Next to their medical doctors, social service providers repr esent the most likely point of contact with potential sources of help for older adults w ho are being mistreated. The fact that one's risk of mistreatment was not related to one's us e of social services indicates that these service contacts may represent missed opport unities for intervention and prevention. Assistance with Activities of Daily Life The final major risk factor for elder mist reatment sought to define the functional status of an older adult in terms of his or her reported need for assistance with activities of daily life, as defined above. We tentat ively predicted that i ndividuals with greater need for assistance would represent greater caregiver burden, and might, therefore be more likely to be mistreated. This predi ction was supported in both univariate and multivariate analyses for emotional mistreat ment, and financial exploitation by family members or strangers. In contrast to ear lier 'caregiver stress' hypotheses for elder mistreatment, it was not predictive of physi cal or sexual abuse, once effects of other variables were controlled. Considering Perpetrator Characteristics 69 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Relative to the general population, it appears that perpetrators of emotional physical and sexual mistreatment had high unemployment, increased substance abuse, and increased likelihood of mental health problem s. Particularly striking was the older adult report that perpetrators of mistreatment were socially isolated, having fewer than three friends in about half of all the cases in which perpetrators were known. These perpetrator deficits may present targets fo r intervention. Reducing substance abuse and increasing social connections in isolated fa mily members of older adults may have the secondary benefit of reduci ng elder mistreatment. Summary Overall, the elder mistreatment assessment strategy used in this study proved extremely effective in detecting all forms of abusive behaviors. This finding is strongly supported when contrasting this study's pr evalence estimates to those derived from another nationally-representative study on the same age cohort conducted at roughly the same time by Laumann et al. (2008). The present study found past year prevalences of 4.6% for emotional mistr eatment (compared to 9% by Laumann et al. who used an extremely liberal, single question assessment of 'verbal' mistreatment) ; 1.6% for physical mistreatment (compared to 0.2% by Laumann et al.), 0.6% for sexual mistreatment (not measured by Laumann et al.), 5.1% for potential neglect (not measured by Laumann et al.), and 10.6% for fi nancial exploitation (compared to 3.5% by Laumann et al.) Proxy Data: Summary and Conclusions Although prior studies (e.g., Pillemer & Finkelhor, 1988) indicated that proxy reports might actually be more sensitive to detecting elder mistreatment than older adult respondent reports, this finding was largely not supported here, wit h the exception of family-member perpetrated financial expl oitation. We had hoped to demonstrate the validity of this alternative method of elder mistreatment detecti on, with the eventual intention of applying it to estimate prevalenc e of mistreatment in cognitively impaired older adults who do not live in nursing homes (institutionalized older adults will require an entirely separate form of assessm ent methodology based on sentinel and technological reports; see the work of Lachs et al. in progress). However, proxy reports produced significantly lower estimates of emotional mistreatment, physical mistreatment, sexual mistr eatment, neglect, and financial exploitation by strangers than did respondent reports. Thus, alternative methods of mistreatment prevalence estimation will need to be developed for community residing, cognitively impaired older adults. 70 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Limitations This study is not without its limitations. Fo remost among these is the fact that all prevalence estimates are based on self-report of precisely those types of events that are notoriously under-reported in this age group. However, several steps were taken to maximize the likelihood that abuse events would be disclosed. First, and in light of research on younger adults and NRC recommendations, we did not use either open ended or \"culturally-loaded\" questions to determine victimization status. Open ended questions in which patients are encouraged, with minimal prompting, to respond to general queries (e.g., \"Please tell me about any times where people might have treated you badly\") do not regularly result in descr iptions of assault events. Culturally-loaded questions are those queries associated with re sponses that may be affected, in large part, by the background or societal context of the respondent. Also, report of all risk and protective factors (e.g., social support) and all perpetrator characteristics was in terms of t he perception of the older adult. No objective indicators of social support were collected. Nor were perpetrator reports of their own substance abuse, isolation, etc.. Thus, the accuracy or validity of these reports may have been less than that obtained directly from perpetrators. Our study design and subject protection procedures precluded such direct involvement of perpetrators. Another limitation of this study was its fa ilure to include, as a covariate or a risk factor, some measure of cognitive f unctioning. Instead, control was achieved experimentally over this variable by requiri ng interviewers to have no doubt whatsoever as to the ability of respondents to understand and respond to questions. That is, all interviewers were trained to review consent procedures over the telephone with potential participants, and were instructed to termi nate the interview, politely, if even the slightest question as to competence was raised. In this way, our data reflect the responses of a cognitively intact, communi ty residing sub-population of older adults, and prevalences and risk factors should be cons idered in that context. By connection, generalization of these results to what may be the group most at risk of mistreatment, the cognitively impaired elderly, is not appropriate. For this at-risk group, and particularly for those members of this gr oup living in residential settings, alternate methodologies are required, and will probably resemble the Sentinel approach used with children. The exclusive use of telephone intervie ws may also be a limitation. Although some research indicates that people are more likely to disclose interpersonal violence experiences over the phone, an in person com parison sample using the same interview would have been useful. Moreover, increased hearing loss among older adults may have artificially excluded some participants. In addition, we only conducted the interview in English or Spanish, and speakers of other languages could not participate. This is a potentially significant problem for some ra ce-based comparisons because older adults of racial subgroups who immigrated to this country are less likely to use English than their children (e.g., Chinese immigrants). 71 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Another limitation may have been the use of live interviewers. An alternative is to use computer, internet, or kiosk based interviews in which no social embarrassment due to the presence of a live interviewer is possibl e. However, this involves significant costs to utilize these technologies in real time. However, one compromise that may be useful in future research is to combine RDD sampling with internet based interviews, in which initial recruitment via telephone is followed by subsequent interviewing via computer. Yet another limitation is the use of a cross sectional design. Of course, though much more expensive, longitudinal designs , particularly of risk factor and outcome relationships, are preferable. This is because longitudinal designs, while not sufficient to establish causality, per se, do establish the first necessary step of causality: that of temporal ordering of risk factor before out come. In this study, our risk factors for mistreatment and our mistr eatment events were sampled simultaneously, thereby precluding this first step of ordering of events. Two additional limitations centered on the fa ct that we did not cover all forms of active neglect (such as deliberate withholding of food) or pharmacological abuse (e.g., inappropriate behavioral control via over-sedation). Although we did cover some forms of active neglect, future research should in clude the totality of these potential behaviors. The extent and character of pharmacological abuse is relatively unknown. Moreover, the definitional parameters of this form of mi streatment will require significant study. For example, does a doctor's prescription for a s edative allay all concerns that giving this medication to an older adult might be abusive, that is, does the prescription 'shield' the caregiver. Alternatively, what degree of intent of over-sedation on the part of the caregiver is necessary for abuse to have occurred? These are questions that deserve direct study and were not addressed by this study. A final limitation is one characteristic of all research with interpersonal violence: that of definitional specific ation and acceptance. This study attempted to break down each form of mistreatment into multiple ye s / no questions that could be combined at later dates to form composite mistreatm ent variables consistent with universal definitions, should such uniform definitions ev er be established by the field. In this report, we made an 'educated guess' as to what these composite variables would look like, and reported prevalences accordingly. Future research should be directed to ward assessing health and mental health conditions associated with elder mistreatment in the context of identified risk factors. Though we have intuitive awareness of the negative effects of elder abuse, it is necessary to determine just what forms of abus e, in the context of which risk factors, lead to what types of negative emotional, functional, and health outcomes. 72 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Unfortunately, most of the mi streatment probably would not ' qualify' for criminal justice system prosecution under most current statut es. This factuality is disappointing and speaks to a societal acceptance of abusiv e behavior, particularly emotionally abusive acts. Analysis of risk factors and characterist ics does lead, however, to some specific areas for intervention. Specific Suggested Areas of Intervention or Prevention Rate of financial exploitation is extrem ely high, with 1 in 20 older adults indicating some form of perceived financ ial mistreatment occurring at least one time in the recent past. Specific resources and civil remedies (e.g., dedicated prosecutors of financial mi streatment in geographic regions with high numbers of older adults) should be derived. Financial exploitation by family me mbers and by strangers was increased among the more physically disabled adults, indicating perhaps a greater need for monitoring for this subgroup of elders. Emotional mistreatment is a relative ly common event, with 1 in 20 older adults experiencing this form of abuse in the past year. It is relatively rarely reported, and even less frequent ly acted upon. Most emotional abusive events are 'legal', though cruel , and the lack of civil remedy virtually assures its sustained frequency. Relative to the general population, it appears that perpetrators of emotional physical and sexual mistreatment have high unemployment, increased substance abuse, and incr eased likelihood of mental health problems. Particularly striking was the older adult report that perpetrators of mistreatment were socially isolat ed, having fewer than three friends in about half of all the cases in which perpetrators were known. These perpetrator deficits may present tar gets for intervention which have the direct corollary benefit of r educing elder mistreatment. Use of social services does seem to be associated with lower levels of familial financial mistreatment and potent ial neglect, but has little effect on the more 'typical' forms of emotional , physical, and sexual mistreatment, indicating a need for training in awareness and intervention among social service staff. Low income, poor health, and low social support all independently predict neglect and point to a deficit in community connection and resources in this population. Enhanced monitoring to assure that older adults, particularly non-white older adults, are not falling victim to neglect is 73 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Social support has emerged as a central risk or protective factor for virtually all forms of elder mistreatment. Moreover, prior research indicated that social support is linked to improved health and mental health, and also seems to reduce risk of physical, sexual, and emotional mistreatment. Programs that enhance and build relati onships between older adults and members of their community, that is , programs that act against the age- related forces of isolation (reduc ed mobility, poorer health, increased morbidity of friends and family) have t he potential to yield extremely high benefits. Overall, it appears that the most effect ive, useful, and feasible intervention to prevent or limit older adult mi streatment is 'reconnection' to community resources at multiple levels. Specifically, maximizing levels of social support, social service utilization, and interaction with community, health, and social agencies will very likely produce immediate reductions in a variety of mistreatment types, and most certainly will limit the frequency and intensity of abusive behav iors. This suggested course of action is possible immediately if existing social service and societal community resources for older adults are made maximally accessi ble. Prior studies demonstrate that transportation is the single biggest issue facing older adults who are trying to engage with their community. It may, therefore, be t he case that lack of such transportation represents a very modifiable risk factor for elder mistreatment. Thus, the first step in building community reconnection with older adults to prevent or limit mistreatment will address the issue of inadequate transportation for these individuals. An alternative tack would be to attempt to change societal accept ance of elder mistreatment, such as has been accomplished somewhat successfully in child abuse and domestic violence realms. However, such movement of soci al mores takes years, if not decades, and more rapid, feasible, and effective steps should be taken, based on the aforementioned data and study findings, in the short term. 74 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.
