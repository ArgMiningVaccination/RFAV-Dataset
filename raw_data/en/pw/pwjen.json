Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy. We need your help. I would like to contribute Study on possible COVID-19 brain effects looked at virus, not vaccines If Your Time is short - A recent study by German researchers did not find that COVID-19 vaccines could cause long-term brain damage, its author told The Associated Press. - The study examined the possible effects on the brain from the coronavirus itself. - The claim originated on a site known for spreading misinformation. A TikTok video shared a since-deleted tweet claiming that \"a European study has found COVID-19 vaccines could be causing 'long-term brain damage.'\" But the study examined the possible effects on the brain of COVID-19 infection \u2014 not effects of COVID-19 vaccines. The [video](https://www.tiktok.com/@kingbaubow/video/7232906178601225474) included a screenshot of a tweet from Leading Report, which [describes](https://twitter.com/LeadingReport?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) itself as a source for breaking news. After reading aloud the tweet, the video's narrator said, \"We knew that.\" The tweet's wording was very similar to a [headline](https://archive.is/NzAfr) from The People's Voice, a site [known](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/07/websites-post-fake-satirical-stories/) for [spreading](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-study-covid-vaccines-infection-brain-damage-914340054420) misinformation. The People's Voice article, in turn, summarized an [article](https://archive.is/fRpE8) by Natural News, which has [spread](https://healthfeedback.org/outlet/natural-news/) misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and was [banned](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/jun/05/health-misinformation-website-rebrands-pro-trump-o/) from Facebook in 2020. Featured Fact-check The Natural News article falsely reported on a [study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.04.535604v1.full) published in April by German researchers. The study, which has not been peer-reviewed, examined the coronavirus's effect on human brains \u2014 not vaccines developed to fight the virus. The study found that the presence in the brain of the virus' spike protein suggests that it \"may contribute to long-term neurological symptoms.\" One of the study's co-authors, Dr. Ali Ert\u00fcrk, [told](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-study-covid-vaccines-infection-brain-damage-914340054420) The Associated Press: \"We have done zero experiments using vaccine, and we have shown and claim zero side effects of the vaccine.\" We rate the claim that \"a European study has found COVID vaccines could be causing 'long-term brain damage'\" False.
