The clinical and economic bene fits which are offered by HPV vaccination for Indonesia are higher than those in developed countries, since considerably more cervical cancer cases will be averted. Although the implementation of HPV vaccination would require a large part of the Indonesian health -care budget, some evidence showed that HPV vaccination on top of cervical screening is considered as a cost - effective strateg y. Introduction Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small non -enveloped dsDNA viruses, belonging to the family Papillomavirid ae. More than 100 types of HPV have been identified (1,2) , among which the h igh-risk types (hrHPVs) are associated with the development of skin or mucosal (1,3 -5). These hrHPV include HPV16, -18, -31, -33, -45 and -52, which may cause cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus and the nasopharyngeal area (3,4) , with HPV16 and -18 being responsible for approx. 70% of cerv ical cancer cases among women (5). Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates consistently present as the second most common cause of cancer among women worldwide (6). Especially in developing countries, the burden of disease is high with HPV -associated cervical carcinoma representing about 25% of all cancers among women. In addition, serious social and economic burdens are generated by HPV -related cancer (7,8) . As a consequence, there is strong incentive among health authorities to combat those burdens through all possible interventions, including HPV vaccination and screening to prevent HPV infection and progression to cancer, respectively (9). HPV prevention strategies in the Netherlands: Cervical cancer as a reference cases Cervical screening and HPV vaccination are the most successful prevention strategies for fighting HPV -related cancer worldwide (10-12). Many developed countries, such as the Netherlands, have integrated these two strategies into their health -care systems, often covered by national health -care insura nce systems with full reimbursement of costs (13). Since most of the studies on cost -effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention in the Netherlands showed that the Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) were below the normative cost -effectiveness threshold of \u20ac20,000 to \u20ac50,000 per QALYs, implementation of these preventive measures is considered that both HPV vaccination and cervical screening represent cost -effective strategies in the Netherlands (14-17). In the Netherlands, since the introduction of HPV vaccination in 2010 (12,18) , the coverage of vaccination has been increasing up to ~60% in 2014 (18). An update of the HPV Chapter 1 12 vaccination practice, from a three -dose to a two -dose regimen, is currentl y under evaluation (13) since several studies have found a comparable effectiveness between two and three doses of vaccination for, so far, uninfected populations (19,20) . Furthermore, a new screening method, involving d etection of HPV DNA, is fully reimbursed since January 1st, 2016 in the Netherlands. This new screening method offers higher sensitivity and is less invasive compared to cytological screening (21). HPV vaccine for developing countries, a greater prospective benefit Studies on the characteristics of HPV vaccination, including immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy with regard to prevention of HPV infection or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) for both develo ped and developing countries generally show comparable outcomes. Although the efficacy of HPV vaccination on HPV -related cancer will formally be available only in the next few years, observations on the prevention of HPV infection and CIN are quite promisi ng, as the natural history of HPV -related cancer includes HPV infection and CIN as prerequisite early stages (5,22,23) . As 80% of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality occur in developing countries (24), the implementation of cervical cancer prevention strategies in the developing countries offers a greater benefit comp ared to developed countries. Nevertheless, unlike developed countries, many developing countries encounter common issues, for example , infrastructure and budgeting, with regard to the implementation of cervical cancer prevention strategies into their health -care systems (25). The implementation of health technology without valid and reliable evidence for efficacy will generate an inefficient use of national budget and unpredictable health outcomes. The role of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) in the decision -making process in most of developing countries has not been defined clearly. This condition could possibly be caused by lack of country -specific evidence and or a limited number of the expert on HTA process in the country. Recently, although several guidelines and or studies to support the implementation of some new health technology are gradually available, for example , guideline and finding s of cervical cancer prevention (26-29), it is difficult to implement these evidence as national health -care policy (30,31) . Therefore, strengthening the capacity of HTA, community control , and strong political will are required to adopt and maintain the transparent use of evidence into the health systems to achieve the greatest benefit of new health technology for society (30). The cervical cancer and it's prevention in Indonesia With a population of more than 125 million women in 2014 (32), Indonesia is confronted with serious problems caused by HPV -related cancer, in particular , cervical cancer. Cervical cancer patients in Indonesia suffer from a significant reduction in quality of life (QoL) (33,34) . Most of t hese patients also experience pain and anxiety or depression due to cervical cancer and/or its treatment. As the second most common cancer among women, cervical cancer becomes an important burden in Indonesia. With annual incidence and mortality rate of 17 .3 Prophylactic HPV vaccination: challenges and opportunities for two different worlds 13 1 and 8.1 per 100,000 women in 2012, cervical cancer represents a significant burden on the government's expenses on cancer treatment. In 2012, the Indonesian government spent more than US$ 43 million on cancer treatment, an expenditure that ranked second highest in the national health -care budget (35,36) . This spending may be considered as an unnecessary loss since cervical cancer is a preventable disease and various prevention strategies are available, most of which are suitable for implementation in developing countries, includ ing Indonesia (5,22) . In 2008, the Indonesian government launched a national policy related to cervical cancer and implemented Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) as the only prevention strategy (37). Despite its low sensitivity, VIA is easy, and importantly, it is a low -cost strategy (21). Five years' evaluation of VIA implementation showed that the results were far from satisfactory, as the screening coverage was low, and there were several persistent impediments such as low -mobility services, sub -optimally trained personnel, and lack of comprehensive promotion of the screening strategy (25). A prospective cervical cancer prevention strategies for Indonesia A comprehensive prevention strategy for cervical cancer offers not only clinical but also social and economic benefits (28). The reduction of cervical cancer -related incidence and mortality will lead to an improved quality of life (QoL), to improved economic productivity, and to a higher income for the society. In the government's perspective, it will raise the national income as it will lead to an increase of the government's revenue from taxes and a reduction of expenses related to cervical cancer treatment. To accomplish these favorable outcomes, several efforts should be made by the Indonesian government as the central policy maker. With respect to the existing cervical cancer screening programme (38), several recommendations have been made by Kim et al. (24) including (i) an increased screening coverage by expanding community mobilization, ( ii) improvement of providers' skills by implementation of continuous quality training, and (iii) strengthening of the screening programme management based on real -life implementation data (25). In terms of the intro duction of new health technologies in a country, improvement of the QoL and the available national budget are generally important considerations for decision makers. Investment in new health technologies, such as - for example - HPV vaccination, will obvio usly influence the national budget especially for highly populated low - or middle - income countries, such as Indonesia. On the other hand, the high morbidity and mortality caused by HPV -related cancer, especially cervical cancer, would appear to support the notion of a strategic intervention to prevent HPV infection and HPV -related cancer. Furthermore, a vaccination policy and recommendations for specific implementation of vaccine delivery are required. According to a national report on vaccination in Indone sia, vaccination coverage among children in primary school is relatively high (39). This condition is promising for a positive outcome if the Indonesian government were willing to integrate Chapter 1 14 HPV vaccination into the national he alth-care system, even though aspects such as vaccine price and, of course, the available budget remain important considerations. A cost -effectiveness analysis will capture the societal outcomes from the investment of HPV vaccination. This analysis will pr ovide a comprehensive description of the societal benefits generated by the investment, as represented by the ICER. Although a guideline to perform health -economic studies in Indonesia is lacking, decision makers could adopt a global normative recommendati on from the Commission on Macroeconomic in Health to answer the question as to whether prophylactic HPV vaccination in Indonesia would be cost - effective (40). In particular, an ICER which is lower than 3 times the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can be considered as a cost -effective intervention strategy in a specific country. With respect to cervical cancer preventio n strategy in Indonesia, the combination of HPV vaccination and cervical screening offers a highly cost -effective option since the ICER of I$1,862 fall s far below the recommended threshold for Indonesia (I$10,425) (41). In addition to cost -effectiveness analyses, fiscal analyses represent another \"easy to understand argument\" for th e government, by providing a general impression on how health technology investments will influence the national budget (42-44). This method implements generational accounting, budget impacts and human capital models to capture all governments' revenue and expense s which are affected by the implementation of the new health technology (44), for example , HPV vaccination, and calculates the net present value (NPV). Furthermore, the NPV helps decision makers to analyze the profitability of a projected investment, for example , HPV vaccination and cervical screening as cervical cancer prevention policies. In the government perspective, the implementation of HPV vaccination and cervical screening will considerably provide a huge amount of fiscal benefit since it will generate the annual revenue of I$2,031,786,000 (45) into the national account. Thesis objectives and outline As described in this introduction, implementation of HPV vaccination in Indonesia may potentially provide substantial benefits in terms of both clinical and econ omic outcomes. Therefore, the general objective of the study described in this thesis is to offer a framework for the health -economic evaluation of cervical cancer prevention strategies in Indonesia, referring to the Netherlands as a role model. Chapter 2 systematically reviews studies which explicitly imp lement a decision -analytic mode ling approach for the cost -effectiveness analysis of cervical cancer prevention in the Netherlands, with emphasis on prophylactic HPV vaccination. Chapter 3 synthesizes the immunogenicity and safety profiles of HPV vaccination for a specific Asian population using a meta -analysis approach. A comparison is also made between sexually naive and sexually active populations. Prophylactic HPV vaccination: challenges and opportunities for two different worlds 15 1 Chapter 4 explores a number of health -economic studies o n HPV vaccination specifically performed in the South east Asia (SEA) countries . Various scenarios of cervical cancer prevention in the SEA region are investigated. Chapter 5 describes the health -related quality of life (QoL) for HPV -related cancer in nesian hospitals using the EuroQol 5 dimension (EQ -5D) questionnaire. A preliminary study is performed to assure the validity and reliability of the questionnaire among Indonesian patients. Chapter 6 provides a general impression of the cost -effectiveness of HPV vaccination and cervical screening in Indonesia using a population -based Markov model. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to explore important parameters for the implementation of cervical cancer prevention strategies in Indonesia. Chapter 7 evaluates the fiscal consequences of HPV vaccination and cervical screening implementation in Indonesia from the perspective of the government. Finally, Chapter 8 summarizes and discusses the main findings from the previous chapters. A perspective is given , policy recommendation and future studies are also discussed in this chapter.

Vaccines 2015 : 589 -604 Reviewing cost -effectiveness of HPV -vaccination on top of screening in the specific Dutch context 23 2 Summary The Addition of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to available cytological screening has been proposed to increase HPV -related cancer prevention. A comprehensive review o f this combined strategy im plemented in the Netherlands is lacking. For this review, we , therefore , analyzed all relevant studies on cost -effectiveness of HPV vaccines in combination with cervical screening in the Netherlands. Most of the studies agree that vaccination in pre - sexual -activity periods of life is cost -effective. Based on published sensitivity analy ses, the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio was found to be mainly driven by vaccine cost and discount rates. Fewer vaccine doses, the inclusion of additional benefits of these vaccines to prevent HPV -related non -cervical cancers as well, and vaccination of males to further reduce the burden of HPV -induced cancers are three relevant options suggested to be investigated in upcoming economic evaluations. Keywords Cost effectiveness, Cervical cancer, HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening, The Netherlan ds Introduction Infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary cause of cervical cancer. HPV infection has been reported to be responsible for 250,000 deaths related to cervical cancer in the world annually. The World Health Organization (WHO) re ported that cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women (1). Within the many types of HPV known, several types of HPV ( e.g., type 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45) are categorized into hi gh-risk HPV (hrHPV) or carcinogenic types (2) and other types of HPV (e.g., type 6 and 11) are categorized into low -risk HPV (lrHPV) or non -carcinogenic types (3,4) . Prevention of hrHPV infection will , therefore , provide protection against cervical cancer development. In order to reduce the burden of cervical cancer, prevention strategies (primary and/or secondary strategies) have been introduced in both developed and developing countries (5). In developed countries, prevention strategies are done thr ough both HPV vaccination (9 -13-year -old girls) and cervical cancer screening (with or without hrHPV DNA detection), as primary and secondary prevention strategies (5), respectively. Currently, two commercially available HPV vaccines are on the market; i.e., a bivalent (6-9) and a quadrivalent (10,11) vaccine. Both vaccines have proven to be effective in preventing HPV infection, especially ag ainst type 16 and 18. Also, both vaccines have their own specific advantages. For example, cross protection to HPV type 31 and 45 was suggested in the clinical trials for the bivalent HPV vaccine, whereas the quadrivalent HPV vaccine provides protection to the lrHPV types 6 and 11 which are responsible for anogenital warts (10,12) . Implementation of one of these vaccines within vaccination programmes may therefore relevantly reduce the burde n of cervical cancer. Long term protection of the vaccines however yet has to be proven. Chapter 2 24 Yet, many countries still face relevant limitations in implementing cervical cancer prevention strategies (13), for exampl e, regarding coverage rates and acceptance. Also, national budget impacts remain an important consideration. In the Netherlands, cervical screening was launched in 1976 for women of 30 years and over and this strategy reduced mortality rates associated wit h cervical cancer by approximately 50% and has been estimated to be cost -effective. In the context of health economic studies, several studies in the Netherlands confirmed that screening of HPV coupled with vaccination was cost - effective, compared to scree ning only (14-17). Also, the influence of catch -up vaccination for older women (18), vaccination of young boys, the combination of various screening methods and intervals (19) and reductions in vaccine dosing (20) have been explored. We syste matically reviewed the health economic studies of HPV vaccination in the Netherlands to provide integrated evidence and recommendations on cost -effectiveness in combination with the cervical cancer screening in The Netherlands. Moreover, we examined study results in detail to infer how they might have been influenced by various assumptions and parameters being varied in sensitivity analysis on the base -case. Finally, we come up with some recommendations based on our findings. Methods Information sources and eligibility criteria of relevant studies In order to obtain all relevant evidence, we searched health economic studies of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening in the Netherlands from two major electronic databases (MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE), bas ed on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -analyses) statement (21,22) . The evidence was searched until January 2014 and the searching process was perfor med on January 20th, 2014. The following search terms were used in both databases: (HPV OR human papillomavirus) AND (vaccin* OR immune*) AND (cervical cancer OR cervical neoplasm) AND (economic analysis OR cost utility OR cost -effectiveness OR cost benefi t OR cost minimization OR economic evaluation* OR pharmacoeconomics OR economic analysis). Selection criteria for the study were: (i) original study with the full economic analysis in the Netherlands, (ii) including HPV vaccination and screening and (iii) published in the English language. Up to now, a systematic review on HPV vaccination in the Netherlands has not yet been published internationally. Data extraction Two reviewers evaluated all articles retrieved, independently. If both reviewers did not agr ee for some reasons, the third reviewer also reviewed the study and conflict was resolved through consensus. We extracted important data from obtained studies based on the CHEERS (consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) statement (23,24) and other criteria (25,26) . From selected articles, we extracted the following information: first author; publication year; mo del Reviewing cost -effectiveness of HPV -vaccination on top of screening in the specific Dutch context 25 2 strategies/comparator; discounting; cohort size; gender; age group; vaccine characteristics (coverage, effectiveness, cross protection, booster dose, and duration of protection); screening characteristics (coverage, int ensity, adherence, and range of age); cost of treatment; incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) and sensitivity analysis performed. In order to make the results from each study comparable, the economic results of each study were updated to 2013 using inflation rates from the World Bank annual Consumer Price Index (27). If an article didn't provide the index year, we assumed that the cost data were derived from the same year as the publication year. Results Literature search From our systematic search, we found 358 and 33 articles from PubMed and EMBASE, respectively. We screened 370 articles after removing 21 duplicate articles. There were 358 articles excluded in the screening process, of which 165 articles we re not health economic studies, 172 articles were studies outside the Netherlands and 21 articles were not written in English. Further more, in the assessment of full -text articles, we excluded two further studies since the first study was cervical cancer s creening only and another study was methodologically focused on discounting in health economic analysis of HPV vaccination. Thus, a total of 10 articles were included in this study (Figure 1). Figure 1. PRISMA Flow Diagram for selection of studies included in the study. Subsequent tables present the comparison of base -case assumptions (Table 1), cost characteristics (Table 2), study results (Table 3) and sensitivity analysis (Table 4) from Chapter 2 26 each study. Publication years range from 2009 to 2013 and si x first authors from three different research groups were involved. Base -case assumptions Scope of the study In health economics studies, the perspective and the time horizon that have been can be conceived as related subjects. To comprise the full impact of HPV vaccination, the implementation of the program should be considered from a broad perspective ( e.g., societal perspective) within a long -term time frame. Moreover, the perspective chosen for a model should reflect the core considerations of th e relevant decision makers involved. Societal perspective has been recommended to cover all costs, savings and outcomes of the disease and intervention involved. In this review, almost all studies (90%) applied this societal perspective, in line with Dutch overall recommendations for cost -effectiveness. To cover all possible costs, savings and outcomes of both HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening, a lifetime horizon is crucial (28,2 9) and indeed most of the studies (80%) applied a lifetime horizon in their models (14,16 -19,30 -32). Most of the studies (8) examined the cost -effectiveness of HPV vaccination for young girls aged 10 -12 (14-17,19,30,32,33) . Almost half of the studies (4) investigated the influence of adding HPV vaccination to cervical screening only (14-17). Moreover, two studies explored various strategies, either the addition of specific screening techniques to vaccination (16,19) or exp licit comparisons between the quadri - and the bivalent vaccine (32). Coupe et al . also explored the influence of various screening strategies (HPV DNA versus cytology and 4 -7 screenings during specific age periods) and cross -protection in addition to direct protection (19,3 0). Westra et al. and Bogaards et al. both explored various cut-off ages for catch -up strategies in addition to the recently introduced vaccination program (18,31) . Reviewing cost-effectiveness of HPV -vaccination on top of screening in the specific Dutch context 27 2 Chapter 2 28 Type of model Different types of models (static Markov, micro -simulation or dynamic) were used to measure the cost -effectiveness of HPV vaccination and cervical screening in the Netherlands, which was in line with international studies on the same topic (34-38). Static Markov models were used in most of the studies (n=7), with herd protection (decreased the risk of infection for unvaccinated in dividuals due to indirect protection) not being included in the model and probabilities, distributions and economic variables generally remaining stable over time (14,16 -19,30,32) . In particular, four studies used a previously developed static Markov model, with the advantage of requiring less complex modeling techniques (14,18,19,32) . Two studies (15,30) used complex micro -simulation for the analysis of screening (MISCAN -model), providing results based on age - and time -specific parameters and distributions, and considering modeled cross -protection. Two further studies applied dynamic (31) and mathematical calculatio n (33) models. Dynamic models are generally most appropriate to describe the natural spread of infectious diseases since it is possible to take herd immunity into account. Nevertheless, the need for the amount o f data is one of the limitations of such dynamic models. Obviously, the choice for static or dynamic models involves a trade -off of complexity versus data needs. Vaccine characteristics A cost -effectiveness study usually extrapolates future effects of the vaccine from available clinical trial data ( e.g., short -term efficacy, cross protection, and duration of protection), in addition to several types of information related to vaccine application ( e.g., coverage and booster dos e) and potential real -life herd protective effects. Almost all of the studies (n=9) applied an efficacy of the vaccine from >90% and for those types included in the vaccine based on randomized clinical trials (14,16 -19,30 -33). One study specified vaccine effectiveness into three categories, which are 1.5% for H PV infection, 35% for development of CIN (pre -invasive lesions), and 70% for cervical cancer cases (15). Two studies (18,30) did not specify the va ccine coverage and two other studies (31,32) applied a coverage of 50% in their studies. Notably, for static models vaccine coverage may not (critically) influence cost - effectiveness estimat es. Most of the studies did not include cross protection (n=7) or booster dosing (n=8) in their studies, and the majority of the studies (n=6) used lifelong vaccine protection as the core assumption in the base -case analysis. Screening characteristics Cerv ical cancer screening has been implemented in the Netherlands for many years. The information pertaining to its coverage (the ability of the program to reach the population at risk) and adherence (the willingness to undergo the screening) has been extensiv ely reported (39). Seven studies provided the screening coverage information applied in their studies (14-16,18,19,31,32) and most of them (n=6) applied the screening intensity of once in every five years as it has been recommended in the Netherlands (14-Reviewing cost-effectiveness of HPV -vaccination on top of screening in the specific Dutch context 29 2 16,19,31,32) . Two studies explored the influence of screening intensity on their results and investigated various combina tions between HPV DNA and cytology testing (19,30) . Half of the studies (n=5) described the impact of screening adherence in their models and all of them assumed an adherence rate of 80% for cervical screening in the base -case (14,16,19,31,32) . Moreover, ranges of screening ages were investigated from 30 until 50 or 60 years old (16,19,30,31) . Discounting Seven studies used annual discount rates at 4% and 1.5% for costs and heal th effects, respectively (14,16,18,19,30 -32). These rates were explicitly b ased on the \"update of the Dutch manual for costing in economic evaluations\" (29). Two studies (15,33) used international recommendations (40,41) to apply discount rates at 3% for both costs and health effects. Only one study did not provide information related to the discount rates (17). Cost characteristics The index years and cost components are presented in Table 2. Most of the studies (n=6) clearly specified the index year for the costs ranging from 2006 until 2010 (14,16,17,19,30,31) . The price of the vaccine employed in the studies varied from \u20ac170 to \u20ac368 for 3 doses of vaccine, sometimes including potential price cuts if included in a large - scale programme (14-19,31 -33). Most of the studies (n=9) presented the cost for HPV - related cancer treatment (14-19,31 -33) and half of them provided vaccine cost items in a detailed description (14-16,18,19) . Compared to other studies, two studies obviously implemented higher costs of treatment for all stages of cervical cancer (14,32) . In addition, there were only three studies (14,19,30) explicitly specifying direct and indirect non -medical costs on their studies, despite the importance of this s pecification for health economic studies which apply the societal perspective. Chapter 2 30 Reviewing cost-effectiveness of HPV -vaccination on top of screening in the specific Dutch context 31 2 Chapter 2 32 Base -case results Clinical outcome Since the effect of HPV vaccination on the prevention of cervical cancer could not be established in the clinical trials, the efficacy of vaccination in the reduction of cervical cancer incidence and mortality was predicted based on the reduction of anogen ital warts and CIN lesions upon vaccination (10,11) . Clinical and economic outcomes from each study are presented in Table 3. Most of the studies (n=7) expressed the outcome as cervical cancer cases reduction, which resulted from HPV vaccination and/or screening (14-16,18,19,30,32) . Only one study provided a clinical outc ome in terms of cervical cancer risk reduction ranging from 0.08% to 0.28% (31). A study by Westra et al. presented a full range of outcomes of HPV infection including anogenital warts, CIN , and cervical cancer cases. Incremental Cost In health economic studies, the incr emental cost is the costs difference between two alternative interventions, e.g. costs of vaccination + screening vs. screening alone. Seven studies explicitly provided the incremental costs estimates between strategies (14- 16,19,30,31,33) . The highest incremental cost estimate (\u20ac1,806 per 100,000?) was obtained from a s tudy by Bogaards et al. investigating HPV vaccination for older women. While the most favorable incremental cost (\u20ac19 per 100,000 vaccinated persons) was estimated from a study from de Kok et al. (33), which exp lored the impact of vaccination on all ca ncers related to HPV infection i n both female and male populations. Overall, ranges of incremental cost among all studies are broad, related to different assumptions and parameters in the models. Specifically, the incremental cost attributable to HPV DNA testing (30) and catch up vaccination for older women (31) were estimated at \u20ac316 -\u20ac453 and \u20ac347 -\u20ac1,806 per 100,000 vaccinated women , respectively. Reviewing cost -effectiveness of HPV -vaccination on top of screening in the specific Dutch context 33 Table 3.

Four articles described LYGs as the main study outcome (14,15,32,33) , with two of them mentioning identical research questions and approaches, but providing completely different LYGs (370 versus 1,234 per 100,000). These differences were primarily caused by the application of different discount rates in both studies (14,15) . Generally, the bivalent vaccine yielded slightly higher LYGs but lower QALYs gained compared to the quadrivalent vacc ine, with QALYs coming from protection against HPV -induced (pre -)cancer and cross protection as well as genital warts prevention. (32). The highest QALYs gained from HPV vaccination was obtained from a study by Boga ards et al., exploring vaccination for older women (QALYs gained at 0.0347 per vaccinated woman age 17 -25) (31). The lowest QALYs gained resulted from a study by De Kok et al. , which analyzed additional vaccinatio n onto current screening in the Netherlands, related to specific assumptions and also a higher discount rate applied in the model (15). Incremental cost -effectiveness ratio The ICER was obviously often applied as the ultimate comparative outcome of cost-effectiveness analysis. The majority of the studies (n=6) concluded that HPV vaccination could be a cost -effective intervention, compared to the lowest Dutch cost -effectiveness threshold even mentioned (\u20ac20,000/Q ALY) (42). Studies by Luttjeboer et al . (17) and de Kok et al . (33) incorporated all types of cancer into the study, with corr espondingly low ICERs (\u20ac6,250/QALY and \u20ac1,997/LYG, respectively). Another two studies from Coupe et al. , which included cross -protective properties and other specific vaccine properties reported cost - effective results at \u20ac22,294/QALY and \u20ac17,469/QALY. Vaccination for older women (17 -25 years old) was investigated by Westra et al. and Bogaards et al. and this strategy seems to be cost-effective as well. These results, however, impedes on the assumption of cross protection in the model, the vaccine price and a threshold for the willingness to pay in the Netherlands above \u20ac30,000 per QALY (18,31) . Finally, comparison of two available vaccines was investigated by Westra et al. , with the ICERs of the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines estimated at \u20ac21,500/LYG or \u20ac17,600/QALY and \u20ac22,700/LYG or \u20ac16,300/QALY, respectively. Funding Generally, most studies (n=8) were funded by unrestricted research grants from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) (15,16,18,19,30 -33) and three of them were co -funded by either the 7th Framework Programme of DG Research through the PREHDICT project (30,31) or the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (33). Moreover, almost all studies (n=9) clearly defined that the funding had no involvement in study design, data analysi s, writing the manuscript or the submission of the study (15-19,30 -33). Reviewing cost -effectiveness of HPV -vaccination on top of screening in the specific Dutch context 35 2 Sensitivity analysis With uncertainty being a major issue in health economic modeling (43), sensitivity analysis is used to assess the effect of several assumpt ions related to costs and QALYs (25,26,44) produced. For policy makers, sensitivity analysis helps to recognize which parameters are the most sensitive for the ICER. Meth ods and parameters used in sensitivity analysis from all reviewed studies were described in Table 4. Table 4. Sensitivity analysis methods and the most sensitive parameters from all reviewed studies Author, (Year) Methods Sensitive parameters Coupe, et al ., (2009) Univariate The efficacy of waning Immunity deKok, et al. , (2009) Univariate Vaccine price The incidence of cervical cancer Vaccine efficacy Rogoza, et al ., (2009) Univariate Probabilistic Vaccine price Discount rate Coupe, et al., (2009) Univariate Compliance to vaccination Sensitivity of cytology screening Sensitivity of DNA Test Attendance per screening round The proportion of women who never attend screening Bogaards, et al ., (2011) Univariate Vaccine price Discount rate Westra, et al., (2011) Univariate Vaccine efficacy Duration of vaccine protection Vaccine price deKok, et al ., (2011) Multivariate Incidence of HPV -related non -cervical cancer Coupe, et al ., (2012) Univariate Waning immunity Screening compliance Cost of HPV DNA test Westra, et al ., (2013) Univariate Vaccine price Duration of protection Herd -immunity Discount rate for health benefit Luttjeboer, et al ., (2013) Univariate Probabilistic Vaccine price Discount rate Cost of cervical cancer QoL of cervical cancer In this review, all studies apparently performed univariate sensitivity analysis. In addition to univariate sensitivity analysis, two studies carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis (14,17 ) by combining probability distributions and analyzing all possible outputs Chapter 2 36 (45,46) . Furthermore, most of the studies (n=6) generally showed that ICERs were sensitive to vaccine price (14,15,17,18,31,32) . Coupe et al . (16) performed a one -way sens itivity analysis for vaccine efficacy, screening adherence, waning immunity, cross protection, attendance per screening round, and proportion of vaccinated women. Waning immunity was considered as the most sensitive parameter, it changed the ICER (cost per QALY gained) significantly from \u20ac22,294 into \u20ac27,539, \u20ac32,128, \u20ac40,160 for slow -, moderate - and fast waning scenarios, respectively. Based on univariate sensitivity analysis in the study by De Kok et al . (15), there were three most sensitive parameters for the cost -effectiveness of adding HPV vaccination to the current situation: vaccine price, the incidence of cervical cancer, and the efficacy of HPV vaccination. The ICER would be below \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained if the vaccine price was below \u20ac44. Furthermore, changes in cervical cancer incidence would affect the ICER significantly, for instance when the incidence of cervical cancer in the Netherlands was changed to 50% of its current level and two times higher, t he ICER would become \u20ac114,973 and \u20ac26,566, respectively. Also, if the effectiveness of the vaccine was reduced and increased by 20%, with the ICERs being \u20ac43,115 and \u20ac83, respectively. Corresponding to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), a study by Rogoza et al. presented a cost -effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) based on 1,000 Markov simulations (14). The result of the PSA showed that to obtain a 95% likelihood, the corresponding Willingness to Pay ( WTP) would be \u20ac27,325. Therefore, many would consider this as a cost -effective intervention. Additionally, the univariate sensitivity analysis was also performed to investigate the impact of various input parameters (vaccine price, discount rate, duration of vaccine protection and booster dose for older women) on the ICERs. Only vaccine price and discount rate were found as the most influential parameters on the ICERs. A study by Coupe et al . (19) explored the influe nce of various screening strategies in their univariate sensitivity analysis. In particular, another study by Coupe et al . (30) demonstrated that the ICERs for both without and with partial cross -protection were sensitive to waning of vaccine -induced immunity, screening adherence and the costs of HPV DNA testing. Bogaards et al . performed univariate sensitivity analysis for various parameters based on three vaccine prices (\u20ac134.35, \u20ac69.86, and \u20ac37.62) (31). Specifically, introducing HPV vaccination in all 17 -25 years old women in the Netherlands could be considered as a cost-effective intervention (\u20ac24,211/QALY). When cross -protection was included, the ICER was decreased to \u20ac15,836/QALY (31). A study by De Kok et al . performed a multi -way sensitivity analysis by exploring the influence of World Standardised Rate (WSR), non -cervical HPV -positive cancer incidence, clinical costs level and vaccine price for the cost -effectiveness ratio (33). Based on their Reviewing cost -effectiveness of HPV -vaccination on top of screening in the specific Dutch context 37 2 results the authors concluded that the incidence of non -cervical HPV -positive cancer was the most sensitive parameter to the ICER. From the univariate sensitivity analysis by Westra et al ., it can be summarized that the ICER obtained from introducing vaccination in 17 -25 years old women in the Netherlands was highly sensitive to the vaccine price (18). With the vaccine price of \u20ac68.29/dose and \u20ac47.28/dose, vaccination would be cost -effective and highly cost -effective for women <25 years old and women <30 years old, respectively, based on a threshold of WTP at \u20ac20,000. An additional study by Westr a et al. , which took both bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines into account, specifically compared two scenarios in the univariate sensitivity analysis: (i) best case ( i.e., vaccine price \u20ac45/dose, lifelong protection, herd immunity and 0% discounting for both cost and utility) and (ii) worst case ( i.e., vaccine price \u20ac105/dose, 20 -years protection, no herd immunity, and 4% discount rate for both cost and utility) (32). The best scenario indicates cost -savings. In contr ast to the best case scenario, the ICER in the worst scenario was much higher than Dutch WTP for both bivalent (\u20ac81,800/QALY) and quadrivalent vaccines (\u20ac66,500/QALY) performed a univariate a nd probabilistic sensitivity analysis, inclusive scenario analysis, to illustrate the level of uncertainty of the ICERs (17). Based on one-way deterministic sensitivity and scenario analysis, the discounted costs a nd QALYs appeared sensitive to vaccine price, discount rate, the cost of cervical cancer and Quality of Life of patients with cervical cancer. Moreover, the CEAC obviously showed that the probability of HPV vaccination being cost -effective is almost 100% i f the ICER is below \u20ac9,351 per QALY gained. Discussion and limitation Cost -effectiveness studies of HPV vaccination in combination with cervical screening were reviewed. In this review, we found that most of the studies reviewed concluded that in the Nethe rlands vaccination in young girls at various ages would be cost - effective compared to cervical screening alone since the incremental cost -effectiveness per QALY lies below the lowest Dutch cost -effectiveness threshold ever suggested (\u20ac20,000/QALY). Our fin ding is in line with previous reviews from other countries, which confirmed that HPV vaccination is likely a cost -effective intervention (34-38). We examined 10 published articles on HPV vaccination for young girls; most of the studies (n=8) used previously developed static Markov models to estimate the ICERs (14,16 - 19,30,32) . Two other studies applied microsimulation models (15,30) and only one study applied a dynamic model (31). Since there was only this one dynamic model used among all studies, it was difficult to draw conclusions on the influence of the model chosen for the ICER. The proporti ons of model types that were used in cost-effectiveness studies have a similar pattern as reported in a review by Kim et al. (47). Nonetheless, the ICERs obtained from a dynamic model seems to be higher than those found in static models, which might be Chapter 2 38 caused by parameter value choices and the dynamic model also explicitly investigating the effect of HPV vaccination for older women. For infectious diseases such as HPV infections, a dynamic model is generally prefera ble since it also reveals the full effectiveness of the vaccines inclusive community -based acquired immunity (herd immunity) from such vaccination programs (48-50). Compa red to static models, the use of dynamic models would require more complicated data ( e.g., data related to sexual contact) but it will likely reduce potential biases in results. Yet, the full impact and mechanism of herd immunity are not fully understood a nd caution should be warranted when interpreting the results. For countries with a high coverage of vaccination, a static model may be sufficient to describe the cost - effectiveness of the vaccine. For example, for influenza vaccinations , it has been shown that both types of models provide comparable results in such situations where almost all individuals will be vaccinated and consequently no room for herd immunity benefits exists nor can be expected (51). Some additional variables and assumptions were investigated to optimize the cost - effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention strategies in the Netherlands. Coupe et al.(16,19,30) explored several variables, such as various vaccine efficacies, screening strategies, types of HPV and waning immunity. Vaccination together with 4 times HPV DNA screening provides ICERs of \u20ac7,302/QALY with cross protection and \u20ac10 ,881/QALY without cross protection. Also, 7 times cytology screening at \u20ac19,192/QALY in addition to HPV vaccination appears to be cost -effective under particular assumptions related to vaccination (efficacy >95%, adherence 100% and lifelong protection). No tably, the assumption on screening coverage used in the model (>80%) was higher than that reported by Rebolj et al. (77% coverage) (39). This might lead an underestimate of the ICER from HPV vaccination compared t o screening alone. This touches on an important issue since one of the main problems related to cervical cancer prevention strategy in the Netherlands is a sub -optimal coverage of screening (52). Regarding the cervical screening, Coupe et al. concluded that HPV vaccination could not replace cervical screening since HPV vaccination alone was less effective in preventing cervical cancer cases in women over 40 years of age than screening (16).This recommendation was consistent with that of Thiry et al . (53), who also proposed to implement HPV vaccination if a screening program is successfully performed. They also menti oned that various alternative strategies of screening and the incremental analysis suggested that 5 times HPV DNA detection plus cytological triage could still be a cost - effective intervention at \u20ac12,774 (unpublished data) (19). Theoretically, cross protection will improve the prevention of HPV infection (54). The impact of cross -protection to other HPV types was analyzed by Westra et al. (32), Coupe et al. (30) and Luttjeboer et al. (17). These studies showed that cross protection properties will decrease ICERs far below the cost -effectiveness thre shold applied in the Netherlands. In addition, they also took the effectiveness of the two currently available vaccines against non-cervical cancer into account. Both vaccines showed favorable cost-effectiveness in preventing cervical cancer incidence and mortality, however , only the quadrivalent vaccine had an impact on non -cervical disease. Compared to screening alone and considering Reviewing cost -effectiveness of HPV -vaccination on top of screening in the specific Dutch context 39 2 cervical cancer only, the ICER of the bivalent vaccine (\u20ac17,600/QALY) was slightly better than the ICER of the quadrivalent vaccine (\u20ac18,900/QALY). However, the quadrivalent vaccine was more favorable if anogenital warts cases were included in the analysis (ICER \u20ac16,300/QALY). These results are in line with the results from various other studies (55,56) , which mentioned that mass HPV vaccination with the quadrivalent vaccine was slightly dominated by the bivalent vaccine. Howe ver, long/term results on cross -protection yet have to be provided. Taking the effectiveness for non -cervical HPV -related cancer into account will improve the ICER and it is important to assess the economic impact of the HPV vaccination programs in this respect. In the studies reviewed here, Luttjeboer et al .(17) and de Kok et al.(15) took non -cervical cancer into account. Both authors concluded that this incorporation would decrease the ICER of HPV vaccination by 13% to 19%. Furthermore, various studies (57-60) agreed that one of the main drivers of the economic and epidemiological burden attributable to HPV infect ion in more -developed countries is non -cervical HPV -related cancer. One adjacent promising strategy next to routine H PV vaccination is the organization of a catch -up program (38). This strategy offers HPV vaccination in older women (17 -25 years old) to increase the effectiveness of the overall vaccination program. Two studi es by Bogaards et al .(31) and Westra et al .(18) revealed that a catch -up program will reduce the lifetime risk of treatment for pre -cancerous lesions from 6.12% to 0.45% for the targeted groups in the catch -up program. Also, it will reduce the lifetime cervical cancer risk from 0.52% to 0.24%. Both studies also confirmed that the Dutch cut -off age of HPV vaccination at 16 years old could be a cost -effective choice. Based on t he most stringent Dutch willingness to pay threshold at \u20ac20,000/QALY gained, vaccination for 12 -16 years old girls was proven to be cost -effective, while if the threshold is increased, vaccination for up to 25 years old women was considered as reasonably c ost-effective (61). Of course, in general, vaccine price is decisive for cost -effectiveness. The weight given to health outcomes and money in the present has been agreed to be higher than their value in the future (26). In health economics studies, especially for cervical cancer prevention, implementing the appropriate discount rates is crucial to obtain accurate calculations. The discount rates for cost -effectiveness studi es in the Netherlands are 4% and 1.5% for cost and health outcomes (28,29,62,63) , respectively. Only a few countries/studies implement a differen t discounting for cost -effectiveness, for example, only studies performed in Taiwan (55) and Belgium (64) implemented a 3% annual discount rate for cost and 1.5% for utility . These studies were unique since most countries (65-67) implement equal discount rates for both parameters in their economic studies. Notably, exact recommendations on discounting are still under debate. In order to maintain the independence of both the author and the study results, it is necessary to clearly specif y the funding bodies and the role of the bodies in the study Chapter 2 40 process. Although most of the studies supported by unrest ricted educational grants from GlaxoSmithKline but all of them obviously defined that the funding body had no role in designing, writing or publishing the study. From the sensitivity analyses , it can be concluded that vaccine price, discount rate and durat ion of protection were the most influential parameters on the ICER. These results were in line with the results from previous studies in other countries, which confirmed that the ICER of HPV vaccination has been considered to be sensitive to vaccine price (68,69) and discount rate (70-72). Regarding duration of protection, since most of the long -term effectiveness of the vaccine has not been obtained yet, authors were forced to use assumptions and/or intermediate outcomes for their model. Inappropriate assumptions employed in the model result in an under - or overestimation of ICERs. Therefore, sensitivit y analysis ultimately plays an important role in health economic modeling. It has been highlighted in previous studies that systematic reviews have a number of limitations. In this study, the searching process was performed only in PubMed and EMBASE as mo st used sources. Knowing the Dutch landscape, we are convinced not to have missed any relevant contributions. Most studies in this review did not include the complete benefit of HPV vaccination. It is known that the benefits of HPV vaccination are not only limited to cervical cancer, CIN and anogenital warts but also refer to recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) (73), adverse pregnancy outcomes (74), cross protection (54) and other (pre) cancerous lesions (i.e., penile, vaginal, vulvar and oropharyngea l) (75). The results of cost-effectiveness studies will be better when it would additionally include all these vaccine benefits. Although we did not assess the quality of each study in detail, we found that in most s tudies - even when using previously developed models - the information related to the model was not always clear and sometimes difficult to assess by the reader. Here gains can be achieved, for example, by using guidelines on performing model -based cost - effectiveness studies (23,76,77) , that advise that the model structure should be described, should be consistent and follow a coherent theory. Generally, various cost -effectiveness studies attempted to predict the best strategy on how to implement HPV vaccination in the Netherlands. Notably, almost all studies agreed that vaccination for young girls is cost -effective. Investigating the influence of fewer doses of vaccinat ion, exploring the advantages of catch -up programs and applying HPV vaccination in males will provide further details on optimal cervical cancer prevention strategies. Expert commentary Several modeling studies related to HPV vaccination have been explored by various researchers (78). Two -dose HPV vaccination for young girls has been considered as effective as 3 -dose schedules (20). Since various studies confirmed th at cost -effectiveness of HPV Reviewing cost -effectiveness of HPV -vaccination on top of screening in the specific Dutch context 41 2 vaccination is sensitive to vaccine price, the implementation of two doses of HPV vaccine next to existing screening strategies will be a promising strategy. Furthermore, parameters such as coverage and adherence to both vaccin ation and screening should be varied in sensitivity analyses in cost -effectiveness studies. Considering the full benefit of HPV vaccination by incorporating the HPV -related non -cervical cancer and using a dynamic model are important issues to provide all i nformation on cost -effectiveness. Five-year view Since the natural history of HPV infection has been understood, it is possible to reduce the number of deaths caused by cervical cancer significantly through appropriate HPV vaccination and cervical screen ing. A new vaccine product has been developed which covers 7 oncogenic types of HPV (79). Moreover, the additional effect of a nine -valent HPV vaccine has been investigated (13,80,81) . Both studies revealed a potential further reduction in cervical cancer incidence. New vaccines will enhance the competitiveness in the same market. A further redu ction of prices for vaccination can be expected in the future. Since the ICER of HPV vaccination is obviously sensitive to vaccine price, lower vaccine prices of new vaccines will increase the cost -effectiveness ratio of HPV vaccination further. Also, sign ificant reductions in the future national budgets allocated to cervical cancer prevention and therapy are possible even if the current price of the vaccine is relatively high compared to some other vaccines (82). Key Issues The cost -effectiveness of HPV vaccination has been modelled extensively in previous studies and those studies show that vaccination of 12 to 16 years old girls is cost - effective. HPV Vaccination of older women in the Netherlands is potentially cost -effective. Vaccine price and discount rates are the most sensitive parameters for cost - effectiveness identified in this review. Taking cross protection and herd immunity into account will further reduce ICERs. Yet, such models require more complex data.

Since HPV infection is the main risk factor for cervical cancer, HPV vaccination is considered a promising strategy to prevent cervical cancer. However, comprehensive immunogenicity and safety information for Asian populations is lacking. We searched four electronic databases includ ing PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov. We reviewed selected manuscripts and extracted the pooled relative risk (RR) from immunogenicity and safety information on HPV vaccination among women in Asian countries. We identified two quadr ivalent -vaccine studies and eight bivalent -vaccine studies conducted in Asian countries. Analysis of these studies suggested that the HPV vaccines significantly enhanced HPV16 - and HPV18 -specific antibody among both uninfected (RR 95% CI 31.51 to 23 3.04 and 62.77; 95% 37.4 to 105.51) and infected individuals (RR 8.60; 95% CI 6.95 to 10.64 and RR 8.13; 95% CI 5.96 to 11.11). Furthermore, HPV vaccination among Asian populations has a favorable safety profile, with only slightly higher risks of local (RR: 1.89; 95% CI 1.65 - 2.17) and systemic (RR: 1.33; 95% CI 1.18 - 1.50) adverse events in vaccinated individuals compared to controls. For Asian populations, HPV vaccines enhance the level of HPV16 - and HPV18 -specific antibodies for both uninfected and infected individuals. Also, the risk of adverse events related to vaccination is acceptable. More data are needed to establish vaccine efficacy with regard to prevention of HPV infection and further outcomes including cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (C IN) and cervical cancer Keywords: Immunogenicity, safety, HPV, HPV vaccination, cervical cancer, Asia Introduction Cervical cancer has become a substantial social and economic issue in Asian countries. Indeed, more than half of the worldwide incidence and mortality due to cervical cancer in 2012 occurred in this region (1,2) . The number of cases varies widely among Asian co untries, with India and China as leading countries. Moreover, it has been shown that, during the last two decades, cervical cancer patients in developing countries have had a lower survival rate compared to those in developed countries (1,3) . The fact that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, acquired by sexual intercourse, is the main risk factor for cervical cancer has b een known since the 1980s (4,5) . There are over 100 types of HPV, of which the high -risk types, particularly HPV16, -18, -31, -52 and -58, represent the viruses with oncogenic potential (6-8). Part of the strategies aimed at control of ce rvical cancer is based on prevention of HPV infection (7). One clinically proven prevention strategy involves HPV vaccination of young girls before they become sexually Chapter 3 54 active (7,9) . In 2006, a quadrivalent vaccine (for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18) and a bivalent vaccine (for HPV types 16 and 18) were introduced and licensed in over 100 countries worldwide (10-12). In 2013, HPV vaccination was incorporated in the national vaccinatio n programmes of almost 40 countries, especially western and developed countries (9). To support the implementation of prophylactic HPV vaccination, clinical trials have been conducted (13-16). The trials have clearly shown that the HPV vaccines induce high levels of antiviral antibodies (17-21), prevent infection with HPV types contained in the vaccine (13,15) , and mitigate the development of premalignant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer (13,16) . HPV vaccines are considered safe, with most of the trials showing that the adverse events in the vaccinated groups equal those in comparator groups (17,18) . Notably, the main clinical trials on HPV vaccination have been conducted in the western or developed cou ntries (13,14,16,22) and so far only a few Asian countries have participated in HPV vaccination trials. Therefore, specific information on HPV vaccine immunogenicity and safety profiles in Asian populations is scarcely available. Extr apolation of results of vaccine trials from western to Asian countries is questionable since trials outcome, for example , vaccine efficacy, might be different as it possibly caused by several variables, including race as well as social and behavioral facto rs (23,24) . Therefore, it is important to obtain specific estimations of the characteristics of HPV vaccination in Asian populations, especially with respect to immunogenicity, efficacy , and safety. In this study, we investigate the immunogenicity and safety profiles of HPV vaccines among both uninfected and infected populations in Asian countries by systematically reviewing available scientific evidence and performing a meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials. Methods Databases and search methods We systematically searched for randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) on HPV vaccination among women in Asian countries from four electronic databases (PubM ed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov). We focused on studies that evaluated the immunogenicity and safety profiles of the vaccination. On PubMed, we combined the MeSH term and text word from each of the following keywords: 'Human Papillomav irus' (hpv OR AND 'HPV vaccine' (papillomavirus vaccine OR vaccine) AND 'Asia'. We also used the same keywords in EMBASE using exp (explosion search), ab (abstract), and ti (article title) commands. Moreover, we se arched 'hpv vaccine' in the Cochrane Library to detect all clinical trials on HPV vaccines and screened the studies manually. In addition, we applied the search term 'hpv' in clinicaltrials.gov. Only studies conducted in Asia were included. Immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Asian populations from six countries: A meta -analysis 55 3 Data collectio n and analysis We included all RCTs performed in Asian populations that provided immunogenicity and safety data of HPV vaccination as outcomes. We only included studies providing the required information for each outcome. Databases as off November 21st, 2014 were used, and we only included papers written in English. Two reviewers (DS and JL) assessed the studies independently and any disagreement was discussed and solved with a third reviewer (MJP). Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re views and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) statement (25), we extracted the following data: authors, year published, country, protocol number, funding source, subject gender and age, active component of the vaccine, vaccine adjuvant, component of the comparator, total sample on both intervention and comparator groups, administration schedule, frequency of immunogenicity test, immunogenicity assessment method, the cut -off point for HPV type 16 and 18 analysis, length of the trial, and the method used for analysis. The risk of biases from all studies was assessed based on The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials (26). We used the categorization 'low', 'high', and 'unclear' risk of bias to assess this aspect. Irrespective of bias risk, all screened and selected eligible studies were included in the review and meta -analysis. To perform the meta -analysis, we extracted immunogenicity (seroconversion) and safety (local and systemic adverse events) data from all selected papers. Seroconversion was mainly es timated from participants who were shown to be seronegative to HPV at the initial phase of the studies. In addition, we also included study populations with seropositive results at the beginning of the study to investigate the influence of HPV vaccination for infected individuals. Local adverse events included pain, redness and swelling at the site of injection, while systemic adverse events comprise arthralgia, fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache , and myalgia. Relative risks (RR) were calcu lated from the number of events including seroconversion and adverse events in vaccinated groups compared to control groups using a random -effects model to obtain the vaccine immunogenicity and safety profile (27). In order to deal with heterogeneity introduced by the differences in the methods and sample characteristics, we performed a heterogeneity test by quantifying the I2 score based on Cochrane Q test results (28). This me thod presents a quantitative value of heterogeneity ranging from 0 to 100% and according to Cochrane recommendation, I2 of 50% or higher are considered to have a substantial heterogeneity (29) and sensitivity analysis was performed . The uncertainty of each result is presented in terms of 95% confidence intervals (CI). In addition, to analyze the impact of variables on the outcome, we performed su bgroup analyses on immunogenicity profiles based on immunoassay and vaccine type. Meta -analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 for Windows. Chapter 3 56 Results Article selection process We identified 465, 454, 84, and 82 articles from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library , and Clinicaltrial.gov, respectively. From these, 21 duplicated articles were removed and 1064 articles were screened based on title and abstract. Most of these articles did not meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, 19 full -text articles were assessed for eligibility, from which 9 articles were excluded for reasons elaborated in Figure 1. Finally, 10 articles were considered (30-39) in the systematic review and meta -analysis. Figure 1. flow diagram for selection of studies included in the study Study characteristics Included studies are listed in Table 1. Clinical trials on HPV vaccination in Asia were performed in 6 different countries (Korea, Japan, India, China, Bangladesh , and Malaysia) and funded by three different companies: Merck, GlaxoSmithKlin e (GSK), and Grameenphone (the first two in pharmaceuticals, the latter in telecommunication). Most of the studies (N=7) provided their clinical trial registration numbers (31-35,38,39) . In addition, almost all studies (N=9) included only women (30-36,38,39) . In general, the age of participants in the studies varied considerably from 9 to 45 years. Immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Asian populations from six countries: A meta -analysis 57 3 Chapter 3 58 Immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Asian populations from six countries: A meta -analysis 59 3 Both HPV vaccines were investigated in the 10 different trials: the bivalent vaccine from GSK (containing HPV types 16 and 18) in eight trials (31-36,38,39) and the quadrivalent vaccine from Merck (containing HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18) in two trials (30,37) . The majority of the studies included placebo as the comparator (30,33 -39); two studies on the bivalent vaccine used the Hepatitis A virus vaccine as a comparator (31,32) . The number of persons included in most of the studies was less than 1,000, but one study in China included 6051 persons, and investigated not only immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine but also vaccine efficacy on the prevention of 6 -months persistence of infection and CIN associated with HPV16 and/or HPV18 infection (39). Studies with the bivalent vaccine imp lemented administration schedules of 0, 1, and 6 months in the trial (31-36,38,39) , while studies with the quadrivalent vaccine implemented an administration schedule of 0, 2, and 6 (30,37) . Although almost all studies performed immunogenicity testing at 7 months in the trial, there was one study that performed more extensive immunogenicity testing at 7, 12, 14, 36, and 48 months, with the primary endpoint of the latter study being assessment o f vaccine efficacy with respect to prevention of 6 - months persistent infection and/or histopathological confirmed CIN associated with HPV16 and/or HPV18 (39). Specific cut -off points were implemented to determine the status of HPV -specific an tibodies. In the bivalent vaccine studies, the cut -off points were 8 EU/mL and 7 EU/mL for antibodies against HPV16 and -18, respectively (31-35,38,39) . The s tudies involving the quadrivalent using (milli -Merck unit/milliLiter) and 24mMU/mL against HPV16 and HPV18, respectively (30,37) . One stu dy in Bangladesh involving the bivalent vaccine used ELISA and calculated the cut -off point based on the mean optical density of 450nm to determine the presence of HPV -specific antibodies (36). The study periods in the studies ranged from 7 to 31 months. All studies were performe d according to the total vaccinated cohort (intention -to-treat) method or per -protocol analysis for immunogenicity and safety, respectively. The risk of bias assessment Although all studies claimed that exact randomized controlled procedures were performed, only six studies described how these random sequences were generated (32-35,38,39) and only five studies explained in detail how the allocation process of each participant in either vaccinated or control g roup was blinded (33-35,38,39) . Most of the studies (N=6) did not explain how participants and researchers were blinded (31,33 -36,38) or how the outcome assessment process was blinded (N=9) (30,31,33 -39). One study presented incomplete outcome results (36) and there were four studies with a n unclear risk of bias on selective reporting (Figure 2). Chapter 3 60 Figure 2. Risk of bias: Author's judgement about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies Immunogenicity profile As mentioned, the participants' HPV16 - and HPV18 -specific antibody profiles were determined u sing specific cut -off points based on either ELISA for the bivalent vaccine or competitive immunoassay for the quadrivalent vaccine. Furthermore, seroconversion was calculated by comparing the patients' status at the start of the study (month 0) and 1 mont h after the last dose (month 7) and pooled RR of seroconversion among both vaccinated and control groups was analyzed using a random -effects model. We also describe the seroconversion according to the type of vaccine (bivalent or quadrivalent). In addition , there were significant differences on Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) between vaccinated and comparator groups with mean differences of 11,866.60 (95%CI 8,443.93 to for HPV -16 and HPV -18, respectively (data not shown). There was a higher number of seroconversions on HPV16 -specific antibodies in the vaccinated groups compared to the control groups, and the difference was statistically significant (RR at 62.52; 95% CI: 16.29 to 239.96). However, the heterogene ity among the pooled studies was moderately high (I2 = 88%; p -value < 0.001). This heterogeneity was remarkably caused by a study from India as it has a narrow confidence interval and its mean estimate was far from the ones estimated from the other studies included in the meta - analysis. A sensitivity analysis , exclud ing a study from India , showed that the difference was consistently high (RR at 75.54; 95% CI: 30.76 to 185.46) and low (I2 = 47%; p -value < 0.07) (data not shown). With respect to vaccine type, the pooled RR on seroconvers ion for the 7 RCTs using the bivalent vaccine 2 1784.59), respectively. The influence of each individual study on the pooled immunogenicity was comparable, with eq ual weights for each study lying between 9% and 13.6% (Figure 3). Immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Asian populations from six countries: A meta -analysis 61 3 Figure 3. Comparison of HPV vaccines versus control regarding HPV16 -specific antibody conversion rate in HPV -uninfected Asian populations A positive influence from HPV vaccination with re gard to HPV18 -specific immunogenicity (6 RCTs; 2,472 participants) was with pooled RR of 50.14 (95% CI: 31.17 to 80.68). Moreover, there was no heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 0.00%; p -value = 0.88). Six trials were included i n the analysis of the bivalent vaccine's immunogenicity on HPV18, with 25.35 to 73.68), illustrating a significant increase in seroconversion due to vaccination. As expected, the quadrivalent vaccine also demonstrated a statis tically significant increase in the level of HPV18 -specific antibodies (2 RCTs; 737 participants), with a pooled RR at 96.04 (95% CI: 33.87 to 272.34). The pooled result on the vaccine's immunogenicity for HPV18 was strongly influenced by a single study from Japan with by far the largest number of events compared to the other studies (Figure 4). Chapter 3 62 Figure 4. Comparison of HPV vaccines versus control regarding HPV18 -specific antibody conversion rate in HPV -uninfected Asian populations Figure 5. Compariso n of HPV vaccines versus control regarding HPV16 -specific (A) and HPV18 -specific (B) antibody conversion rate in combined HPV -infected and uninfected Asian populations Furthermore, our pooled analysis showed that HPV vaccines significantly stimulated HPV16 - specific (RR 8.60; 95% CI 6.95 95% CI: 5.96 to 11.11) antibody levels in combined populations, both infected and uninfected individuals at the start of the study (Figure 5). The clinical trial results on the vacci ne's immunogenicity for Immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Asian populations from six countries: A -analysis 63 3 HPV16 (I2 -value = 0.27) were considerably heterogenic compared to those for HPV18 (I2 = 65%; p -value = 0.01). Again, the study from Japan was of considerable influence. Safety of the vaccines Risks of various adverse events, including local and systemic reactions potentially related to the vaccines or the injection procedure, were calculated from both vaccinated and control groups. Local adverse events were described as pain, redness , and swelling, while systemic adverse events included arthralgia, fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache and myalgia. Figure 6. The risk of local adverse events In most studies, local adverse events were reported between 5 and 7 days after each vaccination for both vaccinated and control groups. The risk of pain after injection in vaccinated groups was higher than control groups (RR at 1.6; 95% CI: 1.36 - 1.88). However, the heterogeneity of the results among studies was significant (I2: 86.53; p-value < 0.0001). Among vaccinated individuals, the risk of swelling at the site of injection was slightly higher (RR at 2.75; 95% CI: 2.23 - 3.38) than the risk of redness (RR at 1.81; 95% CI: 1.53 - 2.16). Chapter 3 64 Moreover, the heterogeneity of the results on the risk of s welling among the different studies was low (I2: 34; p-value : 0.18 ). In total, the risk of local adverse events experienced by vaccinated groups was higher than control groups (RR at 1.89; 95% CI: 1.65 - 2.17). Figure 7. The risk of systemic adverse events Immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Asian populations from six countries: A meta -analysis 65 3 Systemic adverse events were generally recorded until 30 days after vaccination. The risks of arthralgia (RR at 1.94; 95% CI: were higher in the vacci nated groups than in the control groups. Four types of systemic adverse events had similar risks between vaccinated and control groups (fatigue with an RR of 1.17 and 95% CI of 0.99 - 1.40, fever with an RR of 1.18 and 95% CI of 0.95 - 1.48, GI symptoms with an RR of 1.12 and 95% CI of 0.78 - 1.62, and headache with an RR of 1.09 and 95% CI of 0.90 - 1.31). Finally, the risk of overall systemic adverse events in the vaccinated groups was slightly higher than in the controls (RR at 1.33; 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.50) . Discussion Clinical trials, including vaccine -related trials, are often performed in developed countries such as European countries, the USA, Australia and Japan (13,14,22,40) since in those countries the infrastructure and regulations are well established. However, developing countries, including Asian countries, which are severely affected by infectious diseases and therefore could benefit substantially from vaccination, cannot simply adopt the trial results from developed countries, as t he outcomes from vaccination may be different. For example, a study on rotavirus vaccination showed differences in the performance of the vaccine, in particular with regard to its protective efficacy, between developed and developing countries (24). Therefore, evidence from specific populations, including Asian populations, such as that generated by the current meta -analysis on HPV vaccination in various Asian countries, reflects important information for the region. Currently available prophylactic HPV vaccines offer protection against cervical cancer and premalignant cervical disease by stimulating the induction of HPV16 - and HPV18 -specific antibodies. This meta -analysis shows that these H PV vaccines are highly immunogenic, in terms of induction of HPV16 - and HPV18 -specific antibodies, in Asian populations. In addition, the aggregate value of the GMT also demonstrated that HPV vaccines were highly immunogenic in terms of HPV -specific antibo dy stimulation. The current findings on the vaccines' immunogenicity are perfectly comparable to the results of numerous studies conducted in western countries, including the US, European countries, Australia (41-43), or other regions such as Latin America (40) and Africa (44). The studies evaluated in this meta - analysis involved similar research methods compared to earlier studies, including sample characteristics, vaccine types, dosing, and administration schedules. Thus, the similarity in outcomes underlines the robustness of the vaccines and indicates that there is little influence of ethnicity on the performance of the vaccines. Not only primary HPV infection but also recurrent infections may be the cause of the development of HPV -related cancer (45). This recurrence shows tha t the antibodies induced by a primary infection may not always be sufficient to prevent subsequent infection. Therefore, the application of HPV vaccination of populations that have already undergone earlier HPV infection and have recovered from this infect ion potentially provides benefits by preventing possible recurrent infection and subsequent cervical cancer in the future. Our Chapter 3 66 analysis on both infected and uninfected populations showed that HPV vaccines cause an increase HPV -specific antibody levels, als o in populations that have undergone a prior HPV infection. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with several studies on the vaccines' immunogenicity from other regions in the world, which also included both uninfected and infected individuals in their study populations (42-44). According to our meta -analysis, the safety profiles of HPV vaccines were acceptable for Asian populations, with the risk difference of adverse events for vaccinated and control groups are low. Yet, some local (injection s ite related) and systemic reactions (arthralgia and myalgia) were more common in the vaccinated groups, which is consistent with previously reported findings from several other regions (41-44,46) . Nevertheless, to obtain a complete description on HPV vaccines' safety in Asian populations, further studies should be performed, includ ing long -term effects, adjuvant -based vaccination and the potential risks of vaccination in pregnancy. There are several limitations to the evidence presented in this study. The most important concerns that subgroup analysis on the participant's age w as not possible since there were only two studies in young girls' populations and they did not provide sufficient information on immunogenicity and safety of the vaccines. Yet, the study from Schwarz et al. (18) - enrolling 10 -14-year -old girls - and several studies concerning older women showed that HPV vaccine apparently induced high anti -HPV antibody levels up to 6 years post -vaccination for both age groups. These data under line that both young girls and the older woman may benefit from prophylactic HPV vaccination, as discussed above. Heterogeneity in results was observed on the vaccines' immunogenicity for HPV16 in uninfected individuals. According to the sensitivity analys is, this heterogeneity might be caused by differences related to the trial sites, as most other characteristics of the studies included in our analysis were comparable and the weight of each study was equal. Notably, pooled immunogenicity of HPV16 in uninf ected individuals was strongly influenced by one study from India with the highest numbers of seroconversions in the control group. Notably, the incidence of HPV infection in India, particularly that of HPV16, is high compared to other Asian countries (2,47,48) . Exclusion of this study from the anal ysis resulted in a substantially lower heterogeneity in the results with respect to the immunogenicity of the HPV16 component in uninfected individuals. Publication bias could possibly be caused by the exclusion of unpublished studies in the meta -analysis [49,50] . We used standard methods to analyze potential publication bias using funnel plots. With respect to the local and systemic adverse events of HPV vaccines, the funnel plots indicated the absence of publication bias (data not shown ). We indeed tried to reduce the risk of publication bias by including hand search of the literature, inspection of the reference list (snowballing) and searches in databases for ongoing research. Also, as conflicting results on immunogenicity profiles of HPV vaccines are rare, we feel that the results of our analysis can be considered to be valid. Immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Asian populations from six countries: A meta -analysis 67 3 Theoretically, the use of DerSimonian and Laird (DL) generic random -effects model, which is commonly provided in Meta -Analysis software, could possibly lead to d eficiencies in generating pooled risk ratio in meta -analyses for relatively low absolute numbers of cases, as is the case in our analysis. However, Shuster and Walker (2014) who reviewed the possible solution for this concern, found that the majority of me ta-analysis studies published in JAMA provides similar results when it w as analyzed with both DL or Shister, Guo and Skylar (SGS) methods, with the latter being considered as the possible solution for low event rates in meta -analysis. Moreover, the confide nce interval generated by these methods were also considerably similar [51]. Our results provide important information in terms of the immunogenicity and safety of prophylactic HPV vaccines in Asian populations. The observation that HPV vac cines are highly immunogenic and safe for Asian population is consistent with the outcome of HPV vaccination studies from other regions and underlines the robustness of the performance of these vaccines. Since the correlation between HPV16 or HPV18 infecti on and the development of cervical cancer is well established, implementation of HPV vaccination as a cervical cancer prevention strategy in Asian countries seems indicated and justified. Yet, individual country -specific information, especially cost -effect iveness information (49,50) , will obviously be required for ultimate decision making with regard to the implementation of HPV vaccination in specific Asian count ries. Although promising results i n preventing HPV infection, CIN , and cervical cancer were generated by clinical trials on prophylactic HPV vaccination in several regions in the world (11,51,52) , cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the Asian region remains high, in the absence of broad implementation of the vaccines so far (1,2,53). Only a few countries in Asian regions, including Nepal, and Malaysia, provide HPV vaccines as national policies (54). This might be caused by several issues, such as lack of Asian -context -specific evidence on the efficacy of HPV vaccination, socioeconomic barriers, and most importantly, scarce national budgets which hamper implementation of HPV vaccin ation in most of the Asian countries (55-57). However, each year of delay means that an entire birth cohort in a country will miss the opportunity of being offered cervical cancer prevention by HPV vaccination (58). Broader incorporation of HPV vaccination into national policies could produce significant benefits with regard to the burden of cervical cancer. Indeed, factors that contribute to the delay in implementation of prophylactic HPV vaccination in Asian countries should be addressed comprehensively. One important aspect concerns the evidence for efficacy and safety in the specific Asian context. Notably, as shown here, vaccine immunogenicity and safety studies from Asian countries show comparable outcomes to studi es in other regions, including those in developed countries. For overcoming potential barriers in the area of socioeconomics, including acceptance, adherence (59,60) , education and promotion of HPV -related cancer prevention should be further substantiated. Direct promotion by health -care professionals is considered as the optimal strategy (60). In the end, country -specific information, such as Chapter 3 68 cost-effectiveness studies or budget impact analysis of HPV vaccination sho uld be performed to ensure allocation of funding toward optimal preventive strategies against HPV -related cancer, especially when budgets are limited (61,62) . The resu lts of the present meta -analysis demonstrate that immunization with the currently available bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines is immunogenic and safe among Asian populations, justifying the potential incorporation of HPV v accination in national cervical cancer prevention and immunization programmes in the region. Important recent developments in the area of HPV vaccination include the introduction of a nonavalent vaccine, which covers more oncogenic HPV types than the curre nt vaccines and potential dose reductions . A nonavalent HPV vaccine has been approved recently by the FDA in the US and by the European EMA (8,63) . The i ntroduction of this vaccine will likely result in substantial price reductions of the current vaccines, which nonet heless prevent the large majority of cervical cancer cases. This may remove an important barrier for implementation of HPV vaccination in many Asian countries. In addition, vaccine dose reduction has been suggested by several studies from both Asian [67] and other regions [68]. This reduction offers several potential advantages including higher adherence, less budget for its implementation and potentially further decreased risks for any adverse effects. A further important factor in relation to the implementation of HPV vaccination involves the issue of co-infection with HIV, the latter worsening the prognosis o f HPV infection with enhanced progression to CIN and cervical cancer. Accelerated implementation of prophylactic HPV vaccination would appear to be warranted under these conditions. References Papers of special note have been highlighted as: *of interest 1.

However, comprehensive prevention program have not been fully implemented in the region. We analyzed all relevant studies until 2015 from two ma in databases, MEDLINE/Pubmed and Embase. A total of 9 articles was included in this review, evaluating the cost/effectiveness of HPV vaccination in SEAR countries. In this systematic review, although the implementation of HPV vaccination will increase the cost of cervical cancer prevention programme, this vaccination offers acceptable cost -effectiveness outcomes. The main factors that influence the cost -effectiveness results are vary among studies, including discount rate, vaccine price, vaccine eff ectivene ss, the degree of cross - protection, and vaccination coverage. The cost -effectiveness profile provided from this review can be used to inform decision makers in SEAR countries especially regarding the prior parameters that should certain before the implemen tation, such as vaccine price and cervical cancer treatment cost. Keywords: human papillomavirus, vaccine, pharmacoeconomic, cost analysis, ASEAN, south east asian Introduction Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the world. The total incide nce and mortality rate of cervical cancer in 2012 was more than 500,000 and 250,000 cases, respectively. notably, the incidence of cervical cancer was twice as high in developing countries as in the developed countries, and mortality is three times as high (1). Cervical cancer generates not only a clinical burden, but also social and economic burdens for example, reduction of social interaction, productivity and also income (2-4). Cervical cancer burden could be prevented since the cause of cervical cancer is well understood. Sexually transmitted infection with high -risk Human Papillomavirus (hrHPV), in particular , HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 are responsible for cervical cancer (5). Therefore, several factors, including the numbers of sexual partners and start age of sexual intercourse, are responsible for the transmission of HPV infections (6,7) . According to WHO posi tion paper (8), several strategies should be undertake n in order to prevent cervical cancer. This comprehensive strategy should include education about reducing behavior, screening, diagnosis and treatment of both pre -cancer and cancer itself. In additio n, training of health workers and providing an access to those screening and treatment should be included in the prevention of cervical cancer strategy. Ultimately, the introduction of HPV vaccine as primary prevention of cervical cancer should not remove the cervical screening activity since the vaccines do not protect people from HPV infection completely. Chapter 4 78 Two available HPV (bivalent and quadrivalent) vaccines have been approved and implemented as a national policy in most developed and some developing countries (8). Recently, an updated version of the quadrivalent vaccine, a nonavalent HPV vaccine, has al so been approved in the US, Canada and the European Union (9). Each vaccine has its own additional advantages beyond the main effect of preventing HPV16 and HPV18 infections, inclu ding prevention of genital warts for quadrivalent vaccine (10-12), cross protection on other hrHPV types bivalent vaccines (13), and also full protection for other types of hrHPV for the nonavalent vaccine (14). Although HPV vaccines provide potentially high benefits for cervical cancer disease management, the implementation of HPV vaccine as a national vaccination program in a country is challen ging. There may be social barriers, such as rejection from the community on vaccination or parents misunderstanding on vaccination (6,15) . In addition, since HPV vaccine is generally expensive, most countries, especially developing countries, require strong evidence of vaccine benefit including not only on clinical but also econo mic benefits before implementing a vaccination program. In addition, improvement of the available infrastructure would considerably required to introduce HPV vaccine in the developing countries (16). Recently, there are only three countries in the region which are implemented the HPV vaccination, there are Thailand, Malaysia and Lao PDR. The scale up plan of HPV vaccination in Thailand has been started since 2010 and the result s were considerably outstanding since 88.1% of the study population received three doses of vaccination (17). In Malaysia, HPV vaccines are provided for free since 2010 for girls up to age 26 years old at any of the government clinics nationwide. Surprisingly, the vaccine coverage on 2011 was already high (87%) (18,19) . As the first SEAR country which h as support from GAVI initiative on implementing HPV vaccine in the country (20,21) and the pilot project was considerably succeed with about 26,000 girls were immunized in the Vientiane city and province (22). Cost -effectiveness analysis is a well -accepted method to provide evidence for decision makers in a country as it generally measures the clinical, economic and most importantly humanist ic outcomes from a health technology investment. This is also applied in guidelines for national immunization program (23). In addition to know cost -effectiveness of the intervention, threshold analysis is beneficial for price negotiation. For instance in Thailand, originally, HPV vaccine was not cost -effective based on market price at the time of the study. In the analysis, break -even price of the ICER at willingness -to-pay was explored. Then, as a result of the study, the market price has been decreased (18). This information are notably important for the decision -maker in health policy as they ha ve limited budget for an enormous option of health technology (24,25) . Compared to developed countries, budget allocation is considerably vital in developing countries as they have not only the more limited budget but also more cervical cancer incidence and mortality cases (26). On the other hand, higher potential benefits are possibly The health -economic studies of HPV vaccination in South East Asian Region: A Systematic Review 79 4 produced by the implementation of HPV vaccine in developing countries. The south -east Asian region (SEAR) con sists of 10 countries which have similar characteristic on its social and culture. Meanwhile, the economic level is considerably divers e as according to world bank, there are two high -income countries (Singapore and Brunei Darussalam), two higher middle -income countries (Thailan d and Malaysia), 5 lower middle -income c ountries (Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar) and one low -income countries (Cambodia) (27) in this region (19,27) . As the incidence and mortality rate of cervical cancer in this region are on top 10 highest (1,28) , the economic diversity may influence the implementation of HPV vaccination in the region. Therefore, the objective of this study is to systematically review cost -effectiveness studies in SEAR countries to evaluate the clinical and economic implications of H PV vaccination. Method The inclusion criteria in this systematic review were health economic studies on HPV vaccination in young girls performed in Southeast Asian countries and that the articles were written in English. A systematic search in two main da tabases (PubMed and Embase) was performed on September 19th, 2015 using the four search terms: HPV, vaccine, economic, and ASEAN countries. To completely detect all country -specific studies in the region, each country of ASEAN region was included in the se arch term: Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, and Brunei Darussalam. In order to expand the sensitivity of the search term, a combination of medical subject heading (MesH) term and its text word (tw) was implemented in the PubMed database, while a combination of exploded (exp) and abstract - title (ab.ti) was implemented in the EMBASE database. The detailed search terms for this study are presented in Appendix 1. The s creening was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses ( PRISMA ) statement (29). Firstly, a web -based reference management system, Refworks, was used to detect and automatically remove duplications. Furthermore, the initial screening process was performed by checking at title and abstract from each article which has been detected previously. Furthermore, final screening was performed by thorough reading on included articles. Two reviewers (DS and MPO) independently ext racted the information related to health economic analysis according to the Consolidated Health Economics Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement (30). The information extracted from each study were first authors' name and year of publication, country, type of health economic study, study objective, study method, perspe ctive, time horizon, HPV vaccination methods (schedule, vaccine price, delivery and administration cost, age target, and coverage), cervical screening methods (type of screening, age target, coverage, interval), discount rate (cost and utility), cervical c ancer prevention strategy observed, clinical outcome (incidence - and mortality averted), preferred strategy according to the study, Incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER), study conclusion, and sensitivity analysis. Chapter 4 80 As there w as no official cost -effectiveness threshold from each countr y in SEA region, a global normative recommendation from the Commission on Macroeconomic in Health was considered in this review (31). The commission recommend s that an intervention is considered as a cost -effective strategy if the ICER lies below three times Gross domestic Product (GDP) in a country. Therefore, country -specific econo mic classification and -GDP in 2014 were collected from the world bank official web site (19). The economic information, including vaccine price, delivery , and administration of the vaccine and the ICER, from each study , were updated to 2014 and transformed into Internati onal dollars (I$) using country - specific inflation rate and -purchasing power parity (PPP) index, respectively (19,32) . Results From the initial search, we found 33 and 87 articles from the PubMed and Embase databases, respectively. After removing 22 duplicated articles, the remaining 98 articles were screened based on title and abstract. There were 79 articles excluded in the screening process, of which 56 articles were not health economic studies, 19 articles were performed outside the South east Asia n countries, 1 article was not about HPV, 2 articles were meeting reports and 1 article was not written in English. Furthermore, a thorough reading of the articles allowed exclusion of 10 articles: 7 articles were abstracts of poster presentations, 2 artic les were not in South east Asian countries, and 1 article was about HPV vaccination in boys. Finally, 9 articles were included in this study (figure 1).

The Philippines and Vietnam represented lower -middle income countries (GPD per capita:US $1,046 to US$4,125) (27,33,41) , while Thailand and Malaysia represented upper -middle income countries (GP D per capita:US$4,125 to US$12,734) (27,34 -36,38 -40,42) , per capita: >US$4,125) (37). A cost -utility analysis (CUA), adopting Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) as the main study outcome, was performed by 2 different studies (33,35) , while cost - effectiveness analysis, adopting health parameters as the study outcome, was implemented by 2 studies (36,41) . Additionally, 4 studies performed CUA and CEA simultaneously (34,37,39,40) and 1 study performed cost -minimization analysis (CMA) to compare all attributable cost of two available vaccine s in SEA regions' market (38). As also shown in Table 1, three studies compared HPV vaccines against no vaccination (34-36), 2 studies looked at quadri versus bivalent vaccines (37,38) , and 5 studies looked at vaccination in combination with screening against screening alone (33,38 -41). Study design Since the clinical outcomes of HPV vaccination, such as reduction in cervical cancer incidence and mortality are difficult to obtain from clinical trials, a mathematical model is commonly used in the cost -effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination. Seven studies implemented modelling: 5 Markov models (33-35,37,41) , 1 mathematical model (36) and 1 prevalence - based model using 1 -year cross -section al data (38). Two studies from Malaysia were performed using three -year cross -sectional data from t ertiary and teaching hospitals that provide oncology services in Malaysia (39,40) . In health economic studies, study perspective plays an important role as it not only influences the data required in the analysis but also the conclusion gen erated from the studies. Various perspectives were implemented in the studies performed in the SEAR countries including societal (4 studies) (34,36,38,41) , patients (2 studies) (39,40) , provider (2 studies) (34,35) , payer (1 study) (38) and health car e system (2 studies) (33,37) . In order to obtain a complete description of the cost -effectiveness of HPV vaccination, the implementation of lifetime horizon is substantial as the cost and effectiveness of HPV vaccination, for example , cancer incidence and mortality reduction, will only be shown several decades after vaccination. Most studies included in this review imple mented a lifetime horizon for their studies (33-37,41) , however , there were 1 and 2 studies implemented 1 (38) and 10 year s (39,40) as their time horizon, respectively. There were several strategies of HPV vaccination which is identical among included studies: 3 doses of administration (33-36,39,41) , vaccination of young age girls (11 to 15 years old) (33-41), and vaccine coverage of 70% or higher (33-41). The vaccine price implemented across included studies, which is ranged from I$12 to I$1,463, were con siderably wide. Furthermore, only 3 studies reported the delivery and administration costs and it ranged from the lowest of IS6 to the highest of I$40 (33,34,41) . Those costs were obtained from different sources: from previous vaccination program implementation (33), from the The health -economic studies of HPV vaccination in South East Asian Region: A Systematic Review 83 4 national vaccine committee office (34) and assumption (41). In addition to HPV vaccination, cervical screening for older women is also important strategy on preventing ce rvical cancer disease. Cytology -based screening/pap s mear (n=7) was implemented in most of included studies (33,34,36,37,39 -41) followed by VIA screening (n=3) (33,34,36) . The cervical screening was targeted for w omen ages 25 years old until 65 years old and most studies implemented low coverage of screening (n=6) (33,34,36,37,41) . Three studies implemented 5 years screening interval (33,34,41) and one study from Singapore implemented 3 y ears screening interval (37). Additionally, a study from Thailand varied several screening interval (from 1 year to 5 years) in their study (36). As there is only few guideline available on how to perform a cost -effectiveness analysis in SEAR (43,44) , a recommendation from the Commission on Macroeconomic in Health on 3% discounting for both cost and effect in the cost -effectiveness analysis is usually adopted. Almost all included studies (N=7) applied 3% discounting for both future cost and effect in the analysis (34-37,3 9-41). Only 1 study, from the Philippines, used a 3.5% discount rate (33) and 1 study did not implement discounting as the time horizon was 1 year (38) (Table 2). Chapter 4 84 The health -economic studies of HPV vaccination in South East Asian Region: A Systematic Review 85 4 With regard to cervical cancer prevention strategies observed in the study, there were 6 studies that explored the combination of screening and vaccination in a country (33,34,36,39 -41), 1 study analyzed the addition of vaccination (35) and 2 other studies compared the cost -effectiveness of both bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines (37,38) . There were 5 studies reported the percentage of incidence averted by HPV vaccination (35-38,41) and the highest prevention of cervical cancer incidence was generated by the implementation of bivalent vaccine in Malaysia (89.4% of efficacy) (38). Vaccine efficacy on preventing cervical cancer -related mortality was reported by 3 studies (35,37,40) and there was high efficacy was reported by the addition of bivalent vaccine over pap smear in Singapore (37) and the combination of quadrivalent over pap smear in Malaysia (40). The main information provided by health economic studies is the ICER which explain s the cost-effectiveness of a new interventio n in comparison with a gold standard, previous recommendation or existing intervention. Only 6 studies provided the value of ICER from their base case analysis (33-35,37,39,40) , since 2 studies, from Thailand and Vietnam, explored various scenarios of HPV vaccination and/or screening (36,41) , and 1 study from Malaysia reported Cost Minimization Ana lysis (CMA) (38). Studies from Philippines, Singapore , and Malaysia showed that HPV vaccination was considered as a very cost - effective intervention (33,37,39) since the ICER generated from the study lies below 1x GDP. Two studies from Thailand showed that HPV vaccine was a cost -effective intervention since the ICER lies below 3x Thailand's GDP (34,35) . Two studies exploring the combination of HPV vaccination and screening generated diff erent recommendations on cervical cancer prevention strategies. A Study from Thailand proposed that HPV vaccination in addition to screening five times over lifetime was an effective strategy if the vaccine price is low (I$2 per dose) (36). A study from Vietnam considered HPV vaccination as a promising strategy if several requirements were met including high vaccination coverage, low vaccine price (<IS5 per dose), and screening has to be performed for older women (41). A cost minimization study from Malaysia, comparing the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, showed that clinical and economic benefits provided by bivalent vaccine were notably higher than the quadri valent vaccine (38).

Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is needed to compensate the uncertainties. There are two main sensitivity analy ses, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Univariate sensitivity analysis is able to detect the most influencing parameters from the model conclusion, while PSA provides the probability of the intervention to be a cost -effective interve ntion based on a countries willingness to pay. Almost all studies (N=8) performed univariate sensitivity analysis (33,35 -41), while the PSA was only performed in two studies (33,34) (Table 4). Th e ICER generated from the included studies were sensitive to various parameters including discount rate, the cost of treatment, the cost of screening, vaccine price, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine coverage.

In addition, the pre -existing level of prevention strategies, such as the type of cervical screening and its performance (48-50), are also important considerations. A Cost -effectiveness study provides a tool for decision -makers to justify whether the addition of HPV vaccination over cervical screen ing will generate higher Chapter 4 88 health and economic benefits combined with an acceptable budget allocation (24,51) . Our current study found that the addition of HPV vaccination on top of cervical screening is a cost-effective strategy for most countries in the SEAR. These results seem to be consistent with other studies from not only developing countries (52-54) but also develope d countries (50,55 -58). Two studies, from Thailand and Vietnam (36,41) , explored the various scenario of HPV vaccination in combination with several types of screening and compared the ICER with the Commission on Macroeconomic in Health recommendation on cost -effectiveness threshold (31). In order to maintain the cost -effectiveness ratio of below the threshold, both studies proposed a significantly lower price of HPV vaccine if vaccination would be imp lemented as a policy in addition to cervical screening. The l ower price of HPV vaccine apparently becomes an important issue when a country wants to implement a universal coverage of HPV vaccination as it is recommended by studies from not only developing countries (53) but also developed countries (55,59) . Therefore, a reasonabl e price recommendation for acceptable HPV vaccine price according to countries' GDP could be an interesting information. There is some discussion on the implementation of one to three times GDP as the cost - effectiven ess threshold in low and middle -income c ountries (LMICs). Several studies showed that this threshold was not suitable for all countries. therefore, a country -specific threshold should be soon decided using various approach es such as human capital approach, preference approaches or league table a pproach (60). A dynamic model provides a better description on how infectious disease, in this context HPV infection, is spread in a population since it also consider s the impact of waning immunity in the population (61,62) . However, none of the cost -effectiveness analysis, which is included in this study, implemented dynamic model as their prediction tool. An explainable reason of this issues is that dynamic model requires more complex, large and rarely available information especially in SEAR countries such as sexual contact matrix and force of infe ction. Obtaining a specific number of the sexual contact for SEAR countries is challenging as eastern society generally consider this information as a taboo (3,63) . Therefore, a static model (known as Markov -model) is considerably sufficient on describing the natural history of cervical cance r in a population especially when the vaccination coverage is potentially high. Two studies, comparing the cost -effectiveness of two available HPV vaccines in Singapore and Malaysia (37,39) , showed different results . The study from Singapore suggested that quadrivalent vaccine (contain HPV type 16, 18, 6 and 11) considerably more cost -effective than the bivalent vaccine (contain HPV type 16 and 18) while cost -minimization analysis from Malaysia suggested that bivalent vaccine prevents more cervical cancer incidence and cervical cancer -related cost than quadrivalent vaccine. Different findings on the compa rison of two available vaccines are apparently found from other studies, for example , several studies performed in Colombia, Ireland, Canada and UK (53,61,64,65) showed the superio rity The health -economic studies of HPV vaccination in South East Asian Region: A Systematic Review 89 4 of quadrivalent while studies from Italy and Taiwan showed that bivalent vaccine is more cost-effective (66,67) . HPV vaccines are considered beneficial for not only preventing cervical cancer but also genital warts, genital cancer and oropharyngeal cancer (53,61,65) . The i nclusion of these additional outcomes in the analysis will considerably influence the results of this comparative study. There are several limitations in our s tudy. Firstly, a co mplete overview on how the cost - effectiveness of HPV vaccine in SEAR countries could not be obtained since the cost - effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination had not been performed in all countries located in SEA region. A country -specif ic cost -effectiveness study is rarely performed since it has not been considered as an obligation in a drug registration system in all SEAR countries. However, our review suggested that the implementation of HPV vaccination will generates the optimum healt h and clinical benefit if several conditions, including low vaccine price, high vaccination coverage, and availability of cervical screening, were achieved. As the development of cervical cancer disease generally requires several decades of time. A lifetim e horizon is a necessary in the cost -effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination as the cervical cancer prevention strategy. Since studies from Malaysia implemented 1 year and 10 years as the study periods, it is difficult to capture the complete cost and he alth-related information generated by cervical cancer disease (39,40) . However, a general impression of how HPV vaccine will influence the cost and health -related outcome was clearly explained. Expert Commentary The implementation of HPV va ccination will generates substantial health and economic benefit in SEAR countries since the number of cervical cancer cases in this region are generally high. However, an initial investment for promotion, infrastructure, human resources (68), and most importantly, HPV vaccine apparently requires a huge proportion of national budget. This investment could be an important issue as most of the countries in SEAR countries are included in the low - or middle -income country and having a limited heal th care budget. Consequently, a clear recommendation on how HPV vaccination should be implemented in a country, for example on how many doses will be used, how much cost is required or is it a school based - or clinical based -delivery, is critically require d. Another consideration of cervical cancer prevention strategy in SEAR countries were low performances of cervical screening. Although a free -of-charge cervical screening has been provided in several countries, the adherence and coverage of the screening were considered as the main challenges. Additionally, the importance of disease prevention has not been integrated completely in the society. A comprehensive health promotion is generally required in SEAR countries especially in the rural area or in the p opulation with low awareness of health. Chapter 4 90 Five Years Perspective Recently, there are two main updates on HPV vaccination: the update version of quadrivalent vaccine \"nonavalent HPV vaccine\" (9,12) and two doses administration the (62,69) . Previously, each HPV vaccine, quadrivalent and bivalent vaccine, proposed their own advantages in addition to the main benefit on cervical cancer. Quadrivalent vaccine provides add itional benefits on genital warts prevention since the vaccine not only contains HPV16 and HPV18 but also HPV6 and HPV11 (53,70) . On the other hand, the bivalent vaccine provides an additional benefits on another type of cancer, including penile, vaginal, and oro pharyngeal cancer, as bivalent vaccine possess a cross -protection against another type of HPV vaccine noticeably propose a complete benefits of HPV vaccine into society (9,12) . However, as the vaccine price is also higher than both available vaccines, the cost -effectiveness of the new vaccine has to be observed. Several trials on HPV vaccines described that patients who missed one dose of HPV vaccine showed a comparable efficacy with patients with three doses of vaccination on preventing HPV infection, CIN and possibly cervical cancer. In the perspective of the countries in SEAR countries, it can be seen as a great opportunity since the budget for HPV vaccine implementation will decrease significantly. Vaccine price apparently become s an important consideration as many studies suggested that the cost -effectiveness ratio was generally sensitive to vaccine price. Furthermore, a country spe cific study on how the doses reduction will impact the cost -effectiveness of HPV vaccine in a country is required. Finally, several additional strategies, including vaccination for boys if the coverage of the vaccination for young girls are low and catch u p the dose for an older woman, could be prospective options to enhance the effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention.Funding Sources: These findings are the result of work supported by Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) Scholarship, Ministry of National Education, Indonesia.

A valid estimate of a country -specific health -related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients with HPV -related cancers provides a substantial tool in d etermining the burden of the disease. Methods HRQoL of patients with HPV -related cancers (cervical, uterine, nasopharyngeal, head and neck, or anogenital cancer) was assessed using the EQ -5D questionnaire. Validity and reliability were assessed by means of construct validity and test -retest reliability methods, respectively. Subsequently, the EQ -5D utility score was calculated using the Thailand value set. Results The EQ -5D questionnaire was considered a valid and reliable questionnaire for measuring HRQoL of patients with HPV -related cancers in Indonesia. The average HRQoL of the HPV -related cancers was 0.69 (SD 0.10) with the highest and lowest utilities generated by uterine cancer (0.84 \u00b1 0.29) and head -and-neck cancer (0.58 \u00b1 0.33), respectively. Discuss ion A substantial reduction in HRQoL of patients with HPV -related cancers was found in our study for Indonesia. Keywords Health -related Quality of Life, Indonesia, HPV -related cancer, cervical cancer, human papillomavirus Introduction Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections are a well -established cause of not only cervical cancer (1-4) but also other cancers, including head and neck, anogenital (anus, vulva, vagina (5,6) . In addition, the global burden of HPV - related cancer is increasing and developing countries, including Indonesia, bear a high proportion of this burden (7). For example, data reported by the Ministry of Health in Indonesia showed that HPV -related cancers, especially cervical and nasopharyngeal cancer, were among the 10 cancers with the highest incidence and mortality rate in Indonesia (8). Various health technologies such as chemotherapy (9,10) , prevention strategies (11-14), new hormonal therapies (15,16) , and clinical practice guidelines (17) are constantly developed and changed to combat cancer. The implementation of these health technologies has resulted in a wid e range of improvements in outcome measures, with success being influenced by cancer type, study site, outcome measure, or even the cancer treatment and prevention itself (18,19) . Within this broad variety of issues, the need for comparability of outcomes has been recognized and the term 'health -related quality of life' (HRQOL) for this purpose is widely accepted (20,21) . It includes several important health parameters from, for example, physical, psychological and social health dimensions (22). Notably, HRQOL is Chapter 5 102 able to convey important information for assessing the overall burden of a disease and the effectiveness of int erventions. With regard to cancer disease, HRQoL measurement tools may be classified into generic , general cancer , and cancer -site-specific or cancer -problem -specific . -, cancer -site-specific and cancer -problem -specific HRQoL measurement tool s generally provide more detailed information in a single cancer -type or cancer -related problem, while an ultimate advantage of generic HRQoL measurement tools is that, because they can be implemented over a wide range of conditions and interventions, enab le comparison of outcomes across diseases (23,24) . One example of a generic questionnaire is the EuroQoL -5 Dimension (EQ -5D) questionnaire which is developed by the EuroQoL group and widely used across the world (25-27). Further advantages of the EQ -5D questionnaire are that it has only five questions and it is easy to administer and complete. There are two types of EQ -5D questionnaires: the 3 level EQ -5D (EQ more recently developed version with 5-levels (EQ -5D-5L). Several studies support both the validity and sensitivity of the EQ -5D questionnaire in cancer patients (24,28) . However, some studies suggest that the 5 -level classifier system has less ceiling effect and better discriminative abilities with potentially more power to detect differences between groups as compared to EQ -5D-3L (29,30) . Indonesia -specific HRQOL of HPV -related cancers provides initial information in decision making processes since it will assist subsequent studies such as cost -utility analyses. Subsequently, this will allow for comparing outcomes of interventions for HPV -related cancer with the o utcomes of other interventions, within as well as outside the area of HPV - related cancers. The purpose of this study is to investigate the HRQOL of HPV -related cancer patients in Indonesia, using the EQ -5D-5L. Methods A descriptive cross -sectional study wa s performed, directed at the HRQOL of HPV related cancer patients in Indonesia. The study was divided into two main activities, consisting of pilot testing and the main study. Notably, this study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medic ine, Jenderal Soedirman University, Purwokerto, Indonesia. Pilot study Initially, a pilot study was performed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the EQ-5D questionnaire for patients with HPV -related cancers in the specific Indonesian setting. A convenience sample of 30 patients with HPV -related cancers was recruited from Dadi Keluarga public hospital, Purwokerto, Indonesia. On the recruitment day (day 0), patients filled out both the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire and the European Organization for Resear ch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C30, a cancer -specific questionnaire. On day 14, patients filled out the EQ -5D-5L a second time. Health -related Quality of Life of Patients with HPV -related cancers in Indonesia 103 5 As mentioned, the EQ -5D questionnaire is a generic QoL instrument developed by the EuroQoL group, and contains five questions and a visual analogue scale (VAS). The questions comprise 5 different dimensions i.e. mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. We adopted the updated version of EQ -5D, containing 5 l evels of severity on each dimension since it was considered to be more sensitive and reliable compared to the previous 3 -level version (EQ -5D-3L). In addition, the VAS records patient's self-rated health perception, graded between 0 (worst) and 100 (best). The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a disease specific questionnaire developed mainly to assess cancer patients\u00b4 quality of life. It consists of 3 different scales: functional (15 questions), symptoms (13 questions) and global quality of life (2 questions). The EORTC QL Q-C30 was chosen as the comparator in the validation process as the Indonesian -translated version has been validated (31) and some questions, particularly global health status, physical functioni ng, role functioning, emotional functioning , and pain, have been identified as significant predictors of EQ -5D outcomes according to several mapping studies (32-35). Therefore, construct validity testing, i.e. assessing whether the EQ -5D questionnaire can be inter preted as a meaningful measure of the quality of life, was performed by measuring the correlation between each mapped question ofEQ -5Dand EORTC QLQ -C30 as they have the same validity method) (36). Each of EORTC QLQ -C30 subscales was considered to be correlated with an EQ -5D dimension when the Pearson correlation coefficient statistic ally significantly indicated so (32,34,35) . Furthermore, the value of the Pearson correlation represents the magnitude and direction of the correlation (37). In order to assure the reliability of the EQ -5D questionnaire, the two measurements (day 0 and day 14) were compared within patients in order to assess test -retest reliability (38). This method was chosen as in cancer patients, significant changes in quality of life rarely occur withina 14 -day interval and recall bias is possibly avoided (39). Test -retest reliability represents measurement stability, using the Intra Class Coefficient (ICC) (40,41) . ICC values were interpreted as follows: weak agreement if the ICC is lower than 0.40, good agreement if the ICC lies between 0.40 and 0.75 and excellent agreement if the ICC is 0.75 or higher (41). Additionally, Cronbach's alpha was calculated to assess internal consistency, i.e.to determine whether the EQ -5D questions together measure the same construct of HRQoL of HPV -related cancer patients. Internal consistency was co nsidered to be good if Cronbach's Alpha was higher than or equal to 0.80 (38). Main study All registered patients from 2010 to 2015 in Margono public hospit als, Purwokerto, Indonesia, were screened for their eligibility. Inclusion criteria were: over 18 years old, diagnosed with any HPV -related cancer (cervical cancer, uterine cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, head and neck cancer, or anogenital cancer) and havi ng received any care in the hospitals. All patients received and signed the informed consent before both the EQ -5D and the EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire were filled out while the patient's sociodemographic and Chapter 5 104 clinical information - such as age, sex, educati on level and diagnosis of cancer - were collected from medical records. Each dimension of EQ -5D-5L is presented as a dichotomous outcome: no problem (answer level 1) or problems (answer levels 2 to 5). Furthermore, a major outcome provided by the EQ-5D que stionnaire is an index -based -value (utility) allowing calculation of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) (42). This utility index, ranging from lower than 0 (worse than death) to 1 (perfect health), is generated by transforming patients' responses to the five questions, using a country -specific value set. Since an Indonesia -specific value set is not available yet, the utility index wascalculated using the Thailand value set and subsequentlypresented by cancer type (43). Results Pilot study Age of the patients in the pilot study ranged from 22 to 68 years with a mean of 51.5 years and SD at 11.5 (data not shown). Most of the patients were female (56.7%) and diagnosed with head and neck cancer (70.0%), followed by cervical at 13.4% and nasopharyngeal cancer at 10.0% (data not shown). According to the ICC coefficient generated from te st- retest reliability, each subscale in the Indonesian version of the EQ -5D questionnaire had an excellent agreement (0.75). The EQ VAS scores had a good agreement with an ICC coefficient of 0.73. Additionally, EQ -5D had a good internal consistency as the value of Cronbach's Alpha was higher than 0.80 (Table 1). Table 1.Reliability test of EQ -5D for HPV -related 0.73 There were significant relationships between almost all dimensions of the Indonesian version of the EQ -5D with mapped subscales of EORTC QLQ -C30 including physical function, role function, fatigue , and pain.

Strong correlations were generated by some dimensions of the EQ -5D and subscales of the EORTC QLQ -C30, such as between self -care & physical function, usual activities & physical function and pain & discomfort, with correlation coefficients of -0.870, -0.55, and 0.842, respectively.

Finally, 116 patients were included in the study (figure 1). Chapter 5 106 Figure 1. flow diagram for selection of patients included in the stud y The m ean age of the patients was 47 years (SD=2.2, range 25 -75). Most of the patients were female (55.2%), married (99.1%), and half of them had finished high school. Moreover, the proportions of nasopharyngeal, cervical, head and neck, anogenital, and u terine cancer in the study population were 29.3%, 24.6%, 22.4%, 14.2% and 9.5%, respectively (Table 3). Based on information collected using the Indonesian version of the EQ -5D 5L questionnaire (Table 4), the highest reduction on the mobility dimension was seen with cervical cancer (46.42%). With regard to the self -care dimension, only few patients with HPV -related cancers (<20%) encountered problems. Meanwhile, almost half (41.38%) of the patients reported difficulties on the usual activity dimension. Prob lems on the pain/discomfort dimension were heterogeneous. Nasopharyngeal patients reported a high proportion of pain/discomfort issues (67.65%) while none of uterine cancer reported pain/discomfort. In addition, a high proportion of patients with nasophary ngeal cancer (55.88%), cervical cancer (53.85) and anogenital cancer (53.57%) experienced problems on anxiety/depression.

In particular, our finding on head and neck cancer mimics studies from Italy (0.69 \u00b1 0.30) and Australia (0.58 \u00b1 0.50), but those findings were considerably lower than found in a study from Canada (0.83 \u00b1 0.14) (44-46). Several studies in cervical cancer patients reported similar utility scores, such as an Italian study (0.58 \u00b1 0.31), a study in the US (0.68) and a study in another region of Indonesia using the EQ -5D-3L questionnaire an d the Malaysia value set (0.76 \u00b1 0.20) (45,47,48) . Furthermore, the utility index for anogenital cancer and nasop haryngeal cancer from this study was slightly higher compared to what was found in Italy (0.50 \u00b1 0.26) and in Australia (0.58 \u00b1 0.05), respectively (44,45) . The differences in utility index across studies might be caused by several issues including different perception of health across populations and countries as partly represented by the different value sets (49), several characteristics including age and education (50), and also the use of different EQ -5D questionnaires (notably, 5L and 3L) (30,51) . Quality of Life of Patients with HPV -related cancers in Indonesia 109 5 According to our study, the most commonly reported problems with all types of patients with HPV -related cancers were pain/discomfort followed by anxiety/depression . These findings were considerably strengthened by previously published studies on cervical cancer (48) and gynecological cancer (31) patients in Indonesia using the EQ -5D and EORTC QLQ - C30 questionnaires, respectively. The finding of zero cases of pain/discomfort reported by uterine cancer patients may have been caused by th e small number of patients, or the fact that patients were fully adapted to their condition. However, most studies on HRQoL in cancer patients explained that the pain/discomfort dimension had the highest proportion of problems reported in comparison with o ther dimensions in the EQ -5D questionnaire (25,27,52,53) . Although several recommendations on cancer -related pain management exist (17,54) , cancer -related pain, commonly caused by both the cancer itself and cancer treatment, is still an important issue (55,56) . EQ-5D was found to be a reliable and valid instrument for measuring HRQoL in HPV -related cancers in Indonesia, as evidenced by excellent agreement on test -retest reliability (I CC 0.75 for all dimensions) and strong correlations with most of the dimensions of EORTC QLQ C30. EORTC QLQ -C30 was chosen as comparator on the validation process since it has been mapped for each dimension in EQ -5D for cancer patients (35). Furthermore, our methods and results were consistent with other EQ -5D validation reports in severa l diseases and countries including cervical cancer in Taiwan (27) and chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, depression, diabetes, liver disease, personality disorders, arthritis, and stroke) in a multi -country setting (30). EQ-5D was chosen since this questionnaire provides a single utility index and has several advantages, including its brevity and ease of administration, and the availability of previous mapping exercise results. Also, it is recommended by several guidelines (32,35,57 -59). The utility index produced by EQ -5D provides a simpler comparison between interventions for different health problems than other patient -specific or disease specific questionnaires such as the Patient Generated Index or The Cancer Patient Experiences Questionnaire (CPEQ) (60,61) . Furthermore, the implementation of utility information for economic evaluation is generally acceptable, quite often even required, for health technology assessment pr ocesses in almost all regions in the world. Although the prevalence of chronic diseases in cancer patients is substantial (62), we excluded patients chronic diseases' comorbidity since several studies showed that chronic diseases, such as stroke, COPD or chronic kidney disease, significantly further decrease HRQoL in cancer patients (50,63 -65), A study from Serbia showed that cancer patient with complications showed a higher level of depressive symptoms (65). There was also a substantial reduction on the physical and social functioning of breast cancer patients with chronic disease complications (50). Although an Indonesian -specific HRQoL estimate with respect to the influence of chronic disease complications in cancer patients would be generally interesting, this would require a substantially larger sample size. Chapter 5 110 One of the limitations of this study was that the cancer sub -stages could not be presented because the medical records or hospital database did not provide suf ficient information for this. Cancer staging is valuable information in cancer treatment since guidelines generally provide treatment recommendations based on cancer stage. A possible explanation for the unavailability of data on cancer stage is that the d ocumentation process in the hospitals concernedmight not be standardized; there may even be a lack of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) altogether in this area. An Indonesia -specific EQ -5D value set for the 5 - level version is not available yet. Therefor e, we converted the descriptive information produced by the questionnaire into a health utility index by using the value set from Thailand. The Thailand -specific value set was chosen because Indonesia and Thailand have several similarities including social , cultural and economic factors. Moreover, the adoption of another country's value set is practically acceptable (66). The descriptive cross -sectional approach performed in this study limits the amount of information provided. Further research adopting a comparative cohort study could be an interesting option for providing the comple te picture, including the ratio of HPV -related cancers' utilities indexes compared to a healthy population in Indonesia. Nevertheless, this study provides a significant addition to the literature on HPV -related cancers' utility values in Indonesia, by impl ementing a valid and reliable questionnaire and coming up with findings mostly consistent with various other studies in the same field in other regions of the world. Further research into the HRQoL of patients with pre -cancer, sub -stages of cancer or even HPV -related genital warts is worthwhile in completing the information on the full scale of consequences of HPV infection in Indo nesia. In terms of the decision -making process, a cos t- effectiveness analysis on HPV -related cancer prevention strategies using our findings will provide useful information for decision makers in Indonesia.

Methods We developed a population -based Markov Model, consisting of three health states (susceptible, cervical cancer and death) to assess future costs, health effects and the cost - utility of cervical cancer prevention strategies in Indonesia. We followed a cohor t of 100,000 women from 12 to 100 years old and compared Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) screening alone with the addition of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on top of the screening to no intervention. Results The implementation of VIA scr eening alone and in combination with HPV vaccination would reduce the cervical cancer incidence by 7.9% and 58,5%, corresponding to 25 and 98 deaths avoided within the cohort of 100,000, respectively. We also estimated that HPV vaccination combined with VI A screening apparently yielded a lower incremental cost - effectiveness ratio (ICER) at I$1,863/QALYs, compared to VIA screening alone (I$3,126/QALYs). Both strategies could , however , be definitely labeled as very cost -effective interventions, based on a threshold suggested by the World Health Organization. The ICER was sensitive to the discount rate, cervical cancer treatment costs and quality of life as part of the QALY. Conclusion The addition of HPV vaccination on top of VIA screening could be a cost -effective strategy in Indonesia even if relatively conservative assumptions are applied. This population -based model can be considered as an essential tool to inform decision makers o n designing optimal strategies for cervical cancer prevention in Indonesia. Keywords: Cost utility analysis, cervical cancer, human papillomavirus, vaccination, Indonesia Introduction Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in Indo nesia. The age - standardized cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 women in 2012 were 17.3 and 8.1, respectively (1). The long onset of cervical cancer development (2,3) enables the application of cervical screening to prevent and control cervical cancer. Despite the poor sensitivity of Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) screening (4), it is the most common ly recommended screening strategy for countries with limited resources (5). Well -organized VIA screening programs definitely decrease the burden of cervical cancer at relatively low costs (6,7) . The Ministry of Health, Republic of Indonesia launched a cervical cancer control program in 2007 and started a campaign recommending VIA screening for all susceptible women (8-10). Yet, several studies reported various barriers on the implementation of this Chapter 6 122 program, such as limited screening coverage, poor quality of services and subsequent poor cryotherapy performance (11). In addition to the screening program, the introduction of prophylactic HPV vaccination of girls against two high -risk HPV types (16 and 18) (12), which together are responsible for the large majority of cervical cancer development, offers pr imary prevention of cervical cancer (5,7) . There are two available HPV vaccines in the market and their efficacies against HPV infections and Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasm (CIN) have been demon strated in numerous clinical trials (13-17). Next to the efficacy and safety of vaccines, the available national budget for vaccination and affordability present other main considerations for a country to implement a vaccination program. Although the cost -effectiveness of HPV vaccination has been proven in many studies (18-22), those findings not necessarily apply to Indonesia as many differences i n clinical profiles, patient - and population characteristics and health -care systems among countries exist. Although a new health insurance system has been implemented from 2014 onwards in Indonesia, pharmacoeconomic studies have not yet been incorporated as criteria into the decision -making process. However, cost -utility studies on cervical cancer prevention can provide valuable information for the decision maker to design the most cost -effective strategy to reduce the clinical and economic burdens of HPV -related disease among Indonesian women, within the limited budget. The main purpose of this study is to model the costs, clinical benefits and cost -utility of both VIA screening alone and HPV vaccination in addition to VIA screening in Indonesia. To inter pret the findings from this study, we applied the WHO's threshold on cost -effectiveness of immunization programs (23,24) . Methods Model overview We developed a population -based Markov model for Indonesia by using Microsoft\u00ae Excel. The model (as shown in Figure 1) consists of 3 health states (susceptible, cervical cancer and death), which represents the major stages throughout the natural history of infection and cervical cancer. In our model, \"susceptible for cancer\" refers to healthy women, but also to infected women with CIN but (yet) without cancer. This simplification was made to accommodate with the limited data availability in Indonesia; notab ly, more complicated models would lack the data to populate them. Additionally, in annual cycles, women may move through \"cervical cancer\" and \"death\" states. We hypothesized a cohort of 100,000 12-year -old girls before sexual debut as the initial situatio n in the model (25), followed until 100 years old. To estimate the natural history of cervical cancer, we applied 2012 WHO's life table on age -dependent incidence and mortality rate specific for cervical cancer in Indonesia (26,27) . The transition from \"cervical cancer\" to \"d eath\" resulted from death caused by cancer as well as by other diseases. We performed our analysis from the payer's perspective, based on national tariffs that were recently launched by the Ministry of Health for all treatments in primary care and hospital s (28). Cost Utility Analysis of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination and cervical screening on cervical cancer patient in Indonesia 123 6 Figure 1. Markov model for the development of cervical cancer We compared three strategies in the base -case: (i) wi thout any intervention (reference); (ii) with VIA screening; (iii) with VIA screening and HPV vaccination. Both unvaccinated and vaccinated groups were followed in the model with differing risks until the potential screening process. Cryotherapy treatment was assumed to be performed as a part of positive individuals when pre -cancer stages would be detected. Specific proportions of deaths, cancer cases and recovered patients followed from VIA screening efficacies related to the prevention of cervical cancer (29). In addition, we assumed that 15.8% of new cervical cancer patients will have a recurrence and undergo an additional/recurrence treatment (30). The model parameters and baseline values specifically adopted for Indonesia can be seen in Table 1. Screening and Vaccination Despite the extensive communication and the introduction of the national VIA scree ning program in 2007, the performance of this program remains sub -optimal (11). In our study, we assumed implementation of the screening for 30 - until 60 -year -old women within an annual interval of 3 years if the pre vious test was negative, according to the recommendation (8,9) . We assumed that 63,6% of eligible (\"susceptible\" in the model) women would perform VIA screening every 3 years (29). We applied a detection rate of VIA screening of 69.4% (31) and an adherence rate to cryotherapy of 83.1% (11), based on previous studies in Indonesia. Furthermore, a study by Sankaranarayanan et al. showed that the incidence and mortality hazard r atios for screened women were 0.75 and 0.65, respectively, compared to unscreened women (29).

The proportion of high -risk HPV (hrHPV) was estimated from three different studies in Indonesia (34-36). Although the duration of immunity induced by vaccination is formally unknown , we assumed lifelong vaccine -induced Cost Utility Analysis of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination and cervical screening on cervical cancer patient in Indonesia 125 6 protection in the base -case similar with other studies (37-39). We also assumed that vaccination would be performed only at the start of followed cohort (i.e., at 12 years of age), with vaccination decreasing the transition probabilities from susceptible to cervical cancer. Vaccine coverage was assumed to be 76.6% ba sed on the school enrollment rates (40) and the coverage of other vaccinations (measles, diphtheria and tetanus for 7 -12 years old girls) in Indonesia (41). Costs and Utilities In this study, all costs were converted into 2013 International Dollars (I$), using purchasing power parities conversion factors (42). With respect to the economic perspective, we only considered direct medica l costs for cervical cancer treatment and all VIA screening -related activities, according to the national tariffs for primary and secondary healthcare services (28). Cervical cancer treatment costs (both initial and recurrent) were weighted by the cervical cancer treatment patterns for each stages of cervical cancer in Indonesia (34-36,43 - 46) and applied for every newly -detected cervical cancer patient. The total costs for initial and recurre nt treatments were I$4,140 and I$3,169, respectively. In the absence of a national vaccine price and availability of related relevant Indonesian information, we estimated all vaccine -related costs based on the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) revolv ing fund, which consists of the price of a 3 -dose vaccination (I$39.71), revolving fund (I$1.39), freight (I$1.19), insurance and wastage cost (I$1.99) (47). Thus, our assumption for the total vaccination costs would be I$44.27. We adopted uti lities associated with cervical cancer patients based on the Health and Activity Limitation Index (HALex) (48), which allows calculating Quality -Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) by taking utilities and durations of health states into ac count. Finally, we systematically applied an annual discount rate of 3% for both future costs and utilities. Model Outcome We critically addressed the estimated epidemiologic and economic outcomes from each strategy. Predicted epidemiologic outcomes were the numbers of both prevented cervical cancer cases and deaths. Furthermore, as an economic outcome, we estimated the Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) from the incremental costs divided by the incremental QALYs from preventive strategies, compar ed to no intervention. All outcomes were expressed for a cohort of 100,000 women through their lifetime in Indonesia. Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis We investigated the robustness of the ICERs by developing several scenarios with regard to booster dos ing at 30 years of age (scenario I), if the booster dose would be required to obtain lifelong effectiveness of the vaccine. We also i nvestigated the effect of cross - protection against HPV types 31/33/45/52/58 at 25% efficacy (scenario II: low cross protec tion) (33) and 53% efficacy (scenario III: high cross protection) (13). Also, we considered limited duration of vaccine -induced protection, specifically at 10 years (scenario Chapter 6 126 IV: short protection) and 20 years (scenario V: medium protection) and waning of vaccine - induced immunity at 95% efficacy for 10 years, followed by exponential decrease at 50% efficacy during each following period of 20 years (scenario VI: slow waning) or 5 yea rs (scenario VII: fast waning). We based t he vaccine price on PAHO revolving fund for the base -case scenario (47). In sensitivity analyses, we also explored potential reductions of the market price (75%, 50%, 25% discounts on I$125.17) (49,50) , both with and without booster dosing. Price reductions indicate potential advantages of econom ic upscaling and tendering effects if widespread vaccination would be considered to be implemented. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed by estimating the ICERs based on changes of maximum and minimum values for each parameter and assumption, in order to investigate the most influential parameters or assumptions in the model. Parameters included in the univariate sensitivity analyses were vaccine efficacy, vaccine coverage, the efficacy of VIA screening for cervical cancer incidence and mortality , screening coverage, utilities for cervical cancer patients, cryotheraphy coverage and its costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was taken into account by drawing one value for each parameter from its respective distributions simultaneously and estimate the ICER for each strategy correspondingly. We repeated this process up to 1,000 times to provide a range for the ICER. We developed a cost -effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) to describe the relationship between potential Indonesian cost -effectiveness thresholds and the ICER, using the net monetary benefit approach. Based on the WHO's cri terion (24), a new intervention in Indonesia would be deemed very cost -effective and cost -effective if the ICER wou ld be <1x and 1 -3x GDP per capita (51), respectively (2013 GDP per capita was I$3,475). Results Clinical Outcome s The projected annual reduction in cervical cancer cases and deaths as a consequence of VIA screening or in combination with HPV vac cination are presented in Figure 2. Since the cervical cancer progression increases strongly after the age of 40, the effect of cervical screening is most evident in those particular ages. All susceptible women in the VIA screening group have an equal risk again on cervical cancer to unscreened women when the screening program stops after the age of 60. Oppositely, women in the vaccination group remain protected by the effect of HPV vaccination until the end of the model analysis. Assuming an 3 yearly scree ning coverage of 63,6% (29), screening would reduce the total incidence of cervical cancer from 1,842 cases to 1,697 cases (7.9% reduction), compared to no intervention. In addition to the screening, the effectiveness of HPV vacc ination in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer is high, as shown in the figure 2A. Specifically, it Cost Utility Analysis of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination and cervical screening on cervical cancer patient in Indonesia 127 6 reduces the incidence of cervical cancer up to 58.5% and 55,0%, compared to no intervention and screening alone, respectively.

Specifically, these strategies reduce cervical cancer -related death during a lifetime with 24,58 and 97.49 cases per 100.000 women for screening alone and screening plus vaccination, respectively. Costs, QALYs and ICERs Discounted costs and QALYs from each strategy are presented in Table 2. Discounted costs and QALYs fr om VIA screening combined with HPV vaccination (I$5,588,654 and 2,724,504 ) are higher than discounted costs and QALYs from VIA screening alone (I$3,393,833 and 2,723,129), both compared to no intervention. We also estimated that the ICER of VIA screening c ombined with HPV vaccination (I$1,863) would be slightly lower than the ICER of VIA screening alone (I$3,126). Apparently, based on PAHO revolving fund policy, both ICERs were still lower than the GDP per capita of Indonesia in 2013 (I$3,475). Table 2.

An addition of a booster dose to achieve lifelong protection has a limited effect on the ICER (I$3,040). Additionally, vaccine -induced cross -protection against type 31/33/45/52/58 would increase the ICER up to I$1,716 and I$1,570 for low (scenario II) and high cross -protection (scenario III), respectively. Duration of vaccine -induced protection and waning immunity gives a significant effect on the ICER. Specifically, a short duration of vaccine -induced protection (scenario IV) affected the ICER strongly, ra ising it up to 5 times higher than the ICER in the base -case (I$ 8,795).

The implementation of HPV vaccination on top of VIA screening in Indonesia would not be cost -effect ive under the normal market price of HPV vaccine (I$125.17) since the ICER would far above the Indonesian cost -effectiveness threshold of I$10,425 per QALY gained (notably, I$17,106 per QALY without a booster dose, and I$27,092 per QALY with a booster dos e). If a booster dose is not required to obtain lifelong protection, a 50% reduction from the market vaccine price (I$62.59) would achieve the ICER (I$8,466) being below the threshold. With the booster dose taken into account, a 75% reduction (I$31.29) kee ps the ICER (I$6,642) below the threshold (24,51) .

In addition, the full range of simulations fell below I$7,200/QALYs and I$3,150/ QALYs for VIA screening alone and VIA screening combined with HPV vaccination, respectively. Figure 5. Univariate sensitivity analyses for VIA screening alone (A) and VIA screening combined with vaccination (B) compared to no intervention. We tested the influence of each parameter's changes on the cost -effectiveness ratio in a univariate sensitivity analysis. A minor change in a very sensitive parameter that alters the ICER strongly would be find in the top in the tornado diagram. We see tha t the most sensitive parameters in the VIA screening strategy are the utilities, the discount rate, and cervical cancer treatment costs. In addition, the ICER was mildly sensitive to cryotherapy coverage, yhr detection rate of screening, the cost of recurr ence and VIA coverage (Figure B A Chapter 6 132 5A). The most sensitive parameters in the HPV vaccination in addition to VIA screening strategy were discount rates, utilities and cervical cancer treatment cost (Figure 5B). Discussion We developed a population -based Markov model to determine the cost -utility of cervical cancer prevention programs in Indonesia, including VIA screening with or without HPV vaccination. Our study revealed that either screening alone or screening in combination with HPV vaccination can relevantly decrease the incidence of cervical cancer and improve quality of life and survival. Since most of developing countries, including Indonesia, have no explicit cost-effectiveness criteria to justify the implementation of a new intervention, we applied the W HO's recommendation on cost -effectiveness thresholds, stating that an intervention can be categorized as a cost -effective intervention if the ICER lies below three times the GDP per capita (24). As the GDP per capita of Indonesia in 2013 was approximately I$3,475 (51), both VIA screening (I$3,126) and VIA screening in combination with HPV vaccination (I$1,863) c ompared to doing nothing can be considered as very cost -effective strategies. Specifically, the most cost -effective strategy is the combination of VIA screening and HPV vaccination. To our knowledge, this is the first cost -utility analysis of cervical canc er prevention strategies in Indonesia. However, the result of this study, that HPV vaccination on top of cervical screening could be a cost -effective intervention, is in line with previous studies in other developing countries (52-57). We selected the payer's perspective for our study, which is in line with the new policy that has been implemented by the Indonesian government in early 2014 to cover almost all health -care services in primary and secondary settings (28,58) . This method provides a clear picture of the average cost of cervical cancer treatment in Indonesia. Although, the cost of cervical cancer treatment in this study is estimated either l ower (59) or higher (52,60) compared to other countries, the addition of HPV vaccination on top of VIA screening is considered as a cost -effective strategy as in those other countries. As the long -term efficacy of the current HPV vaccination has not been established, we investigated the possibility that a booster dose would be needed to achieve lifelong protection. As expected, the addition of a booster dose yielded a higher ICER, but th e value itself remained below the GDP per capita of Indonesia. This finding is also in accordance with other studies in several settings (37,56,61) . Moreover, the vaccine's effectiveness is not on ly influenced by the implementation of a booster dose, but also by other variables such as vaccination coverage, the distribution of HPV types and adherence (29,56) . In this study, the effect of cross -protection against HPV types 31/33/45/52/58 is limited, as illustrated by limited reduction s from I$1,630 in the base -case to I$1,488 and I$1,346 for scenarios with low -and high effect of cross -protection, respectively. This finding is similar to several studies from other countries, that investigated the effect of cross -protection on cost - effec tiveness (38,62) . Despite the fact that the distributions of HPV types in various Cost Utility Analysis of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination and cervical screening on cervical cancer patient in Indonesia 133 6 countries are evidently different (34-36) and that this considerably influences the overall vaccine effectiveness fr om a clinical perspective, cross -protection against other hrHPV types can be highly interesting in other settings in South -East Asia. Based on a vaccine price derived from the PAHO revolving fund policy, the addition of vaccination yielded a cost -effectiv e strategy in preventing cervical cancer. Yet, at the current market price of HPV vaccines it appears that the addition of HPV vaccination to VIA screening is not a cost -effective intervention in Indonesia. A range of 50 -75% reductions from the vaccine mar ket price is required to maintain HPV vaccination in combination with VIA screening as a cost -effective strategy. This result suggests that a reduction of HPV vaccine price, compared to market price will be essential for the HPV vaccine to be included in the immunization schedule in Indonesia. Notwithstanding the fact that a lack exists for data related to CIN or pre -cancer in Indonesia, our model can be considered to still validly and adequately estimate the natural history of cervical cancer patients in Indonesia based on actual epidemiological data from the WHO. For example, the natural history of cervical cancer patients, cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for the population at risk could be described and implemented in the model. Notably, fe wer assumptions were required in our model compared to a more complex Markov structure or even dynamic model, as we did not incorporate any transition to HPV infection or staging on pre -cancer and cancer stages. More complex modelling can be embarked upon if mare data become available. Despite the novelty of this study, it still has several limitations. Firstly, we did not take the vaccine protection for low risk HPV (type 6 and 11) into account. Although the data related to the effectiveness of both vacci nes against other types of HPV is already available (63), the information related to the costs and QALYs caused by low -risk HPV (lrHPV) in Indonesia is scarce. Secondly, incorporation of genital warts as a consequence of HPV types 6 and 11 also will introduce further differences in clinical benefits (i.e. QALYs) b etween both available vaccines in the market. However to which extend this will be the case should be further investigated (64). Therefore, further research shou ld be directed to the clinical burden and costs of genital warts in Indonesia to make a more precise comparison between both vaccines. Another limitation in this study is the potential benefit of HPV vaccines against non-cervical HPV -related cancers. Anal, vaginal, papilomatosis and other pre -cancerous lesion were not taken into account in the current model. The inclusion of these types of HPV -induced diseases will increase the savings and quality of life gai ns of HPV vaccination and consequently improve the cost -effectiveness of HPV vaccination (65-69). Although w e assumed 3 -yearly screening in this model, the efficacy of the screening on preventing cervical cancer incidence and mortality are still considerably low. This can potentially be related to the fact that we did not incorporated the cumulative effect of Chapter 6 134 repeated screening in the model (29). Moreover, women who have negative results on their previous screening noticeably has lower risk of cervical cancer incidence and mortality compared to unscreened women. In this model we assumed that they have equal risk since the straightforward static Markov model has no ability to remember where the patient has come from nor the exact timing of that transition (70). Yet, univariate sensitivity analysis showed that the influence of screening efficacy on the ICER is very low. Notably, our results are consistent with previous studies from neighboring countries (20- 22,38,53,56,57) by confirming that HPV vaccination in addition to screening can be a cost - effective intervention if it can be obtained at a price similar to, for example, the PAHO price . This finding may encourage the policy makers in Indonesia to further consider, decide and implement optimal cervical cancer prevention strategies. Conclusion The addition of HPV vaccination on top of VIA screening in Indonesia, even in the context of various conservative assumptions (need a booster dose to obtain full protection, low cross protection, short vaccine protection and fast waning immunity), is a very cost -effective strategy. Substantial clinical and economic benefits can be obtained by implementing an HPV vaccination program. Nevertheless, improvement of the screening program itself also remains important and provides further potentials to achieve optimal cervical cance r prevention strategies.

HPV vaccination and/or cervical cancer screening among females may reduce the burden of HPV -related diseases, incl uding cervical cancer. However, limited funds may impede the implementation of population - based programmes. Governmental investments in the prevention of infectious disease may have broader economic and fiscal benefits, which are not accounted in conventio nal economic analyses. This study estimates the broader economic and fiscal impacts of implementing HPV vaccination and/or cervical cancer screening in Indonesia from the perspective of the government. Methods: A government -perspective quantitative analyti c framework was applied to assess the Net Present Value (NPV) of investment on cervical cancer prevention strategies including HPV vaccination, cervical screening and its combination in Indonesia. All monetary values were presented in International Dollars (I$) Results: Based on a cohort of 10,000,000 Indonesian 12 -year -old females, it was estimated that HPV vaccination and/or cervical cancer screening result in a positive NPV for the Indonesian government. The combination of cervical screening and HPV vacc ination generated a substantial reduction of cervical cancer incidence and HPV -related mortality of 87,862 and 19,359, respectively. It was estimated that HPV vaccination in combination with cervical screening is the most favorable option for cervical canc er prevention (NPV I$2.031.786.000), followed by HPV vaccination I$1.860.783.000) and cervical screening alone (NPV I$375.244.000). Conclusion: In addition to clinical benefits, investing in HPV vaccination and cervical screening may yield cons iderable fiscal benefits for the Indonesian governments due to lifelong benefits resulting from reduction of cervical cancer -related morbidity and mortality. Keywords HPV, HPV vaccination, cervical cancer, cervical cancer screening, broader economic analys is Introduction High -risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPV), in particular HPV16 and HPV18, are responsible for cervical cancer and premalignant cervical disease among woman (1-5). Although cervical cancer is considered as a preventable disease when detected and managed in the early stages, it still poses a serious health and economic burden, especially in developing countries (6-8). The WHO recommends primary prevention through vaccination against HPV and secondary prevention through cervical screening for pre -cancerous lesions (9). Numerous studies have shown that cervical screening is beneficial in terms of lowering the incidence of pre-cancerous lesions and cervical cancer (8,10,11) . Moreover, the two approved Chapter 7 146 prophylactic vaccines against HPV have also demonstrated consi derable benefits in terms of reduction of HPV infection and Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) (9,12 -15). Several health -economic analyses have shown that HPV vaccination combined with cervical cancer screening results in an efficient use of healthcare resources (16-19). Such analyses typically assess the cost -effectiveness of adding HPV vaccination to screening. Hence, most economic analyses focus on evaluating the technical efficiency of the healthcare budget (20). Implementation of vaccination an d cervical cancer screening programmes is dependent on affordability and local infrastructure especially in low/middle -income countries, which have limited infrastructure, human resources , and funds. In low/middle -income countries, implementation of popula tion-based HPV vaccination and screening programmes, such as VIA screening which is suitable for low/middle -income countries, may require funds additional to the healthcare budget. Hence, economic analyses should be capable of providing decision -makers wit h measures for the broader economic impact and cross - sectorial consequences of resource allocation decisions. HPV infection and cervical cancer disease pose a substantial morbidity and mortality burden. In 2012, there were over 20,000 new cases of cervi cal cancer and 9,000 cervical -cancer related deaths (7). The implementation of a population -based HPV vaccination and/or VIA screening programme requires a substantial investment, but it potentially reduces the burden of cervical cancer. Additional b enefits including more women who are able to work, more women gain income (21-23), and on the government perspective, there will be more workers who pay the taxes and health/social security premium. Notably, health -economic and broader economic benefits including fiscal benefits for the Indonesian government could be achieved. In this study, w e assess the broader economic consequences of introducing HPV vaccination in Indonesia with emphasis on the potential positive and negative fiscal effects of the latest policy of the Indonesian National Social Security System (SJSN ) for HPV prevention. Methods & Data The natural history of cervical cancer for Indonesian women was modeled based on a previously published population -based Markov model (24). The cervical cancer prevention strategies, including HPV vaccination (3 doses of vaccination and 76.6% coverage) and/ or VIA screening (every three years for 30 -60 years old and 2 1.2% yearly coverage), were also adopted from the same study. An additional strategy, HPV vaccination alone, was also added in the analysis. This population -based Markov model was chosen given the scarce availability of data, hampering the development of a more complex modeling approach. Several validation steps were taken, including face validity checks for both the conceptual model and the input parameters, extreme value testing and testing of traces. The fiscal analysis described here simulates the natur al history and costs of cervical cancer patients in Indonesia. Susceptible, cervical cancer and death states were modeled and a Assessment of the broader economic consequences of HPV prevention from a government -perspective: A fiscal analytic approach 147 7 simulation was run for a cohort of 10,000,000 Indonesian 12 -year -old girls over their lifetime (25,26) . Cervical canc er prevention strategies, that were assessed, included (i) cervical screening, (ii) HPV vaccination and (iii) HPV vaccination plus cervical cancer screening. The reduction of HPV -related morbidity and mortality resulting from each of the assessed strategie s was quantified and translated into changes in age -specific gross tax revenue and government transfer costs over the lifetime of the cohort. Specifically, based on previously published methods for assessing of the broader economic consequences of health -care interventions (27-29), morbidity and mortality reductions were translated into discounted, lifetime fiscal benefits for the Indonesian government. Hence, prevention of HPV -related mortality and morbidity benefits were converted into discounted lifetime (i) add itional gross, direct and indirect tax revenues, (ii) health -care cost savings and (iii) social insurance cost - savings. Fiscal expenses, i.e. the cost of vaccination and the additional governmental transfers (i.e. pensions) resulting from the additional su rvival produced by HPV prevention in Indonesia, were discounted and deducted from the fiscal benefits of HPV prevention to produce the Net Present Value (NPV) of each HPV prevention strategy. In order to estimate the lifetime earnings and, thus, the lifeti me tax revenues to be gained from the average Indonesian female, earnings distribution was categorized into three levels (20% high -income earners, 40% middle -income earners, and 40% low -income earners) and the average of each earnings level, based on the I ndonesian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using Gini index of 0.41 (30,31) , was estimated. Furthermore, annual earnings were adjusted for future productivity based on the labor productivity index from The Organizatio n for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) (32). Earnings were also adjusted to reflect the proportion of female workforce participation (25,33) . Moreover, the average age of entering the workforce and the average retirement age of Indonesian civil servants were considered in the model (34,35) . Direct tax was estimated based on the Indonesian earnings tax law (36,37) and applied for each level of income. Thus, the model assumed that tax revenue stems from middle - and high -income earnings only, since the average earnings of the low -income population lies below the taxable earnings threshold. Indirect tax was estimated based on the Value Added Tax (VAT) policy (38,39) and household consumption expenditure per capita (40). Furthermore, we assumed that VAT adherence and collectability rate was 50% (41) (Table 1). Chapter 7 148 Table 1.

The benefits provided by the social security system are pensio n funds, and work -related accident and death benefits (44,45) . Old -age pensions were estimated based on 60% of the earnings in the last employment year (48). Direct costs related to pre - cancerous lesions, cervical cancer and investment cos ts for prevention programs were included in the model based on the study by Setiawan, et al. (24). Costs were inflated to current prices using an inflation rate of 6.42% which reflects the average inflation in 2014 (43). Direct costs attributed to genital warts have not been included in this analysis as they are likely to have limited fiscal consequences in the context of treatment in Indonesia. The discounted cash flow method was used to obtain the present value of cash inflows and outflows. The results were presented in terms of the Net Present Value (NPV) of the investment decision for each of the cervical cancer prevention strategies under study as follows: =( (1+))0 =0 NPVs were calculated by subt racting incremental expenses (E t), including vaccine cost at t=0 (K0) from incremental revenues (R t) for each of strategy. Increments refer to the difference between the revenue and expenses with and without the HPV prevention strategy under consideration. All values were discounted (r) by 3% according to WHO recommendation and also consistent with previous cost -effectiveness studies on cervical cancer prevention programmes in Indonesia. In order to examine the sensitivity of the model to its parameters, un ivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted for the NPV of each HPV prevention strategy. The ranges around input parameters including inflation rate, discount rate, Gross domestic products (GDP), tax compliance, membership of health and social security, p ercentage of earnings consumed and percentage of work -related accident premium. Inflation and discount rates were varied by the lowest and highest value of Indonesian inflation rate in 2014 (43) and acceptable discount rates from various countries (49), respectively. The lower and upper limits for GDP were defined by the lowest and highest GDP value of the previous 5 years (50), while the Chapter 7 150 ranges for the proportion of earnings consumed were based on previous 3 years' data (51). Tax compliance, health and social security membership were varied based on assumptions since the distributions for this parameters were not available. Results Based on a single cohort of 10,000,000 girls in Indonesia, our model showed that in the absence of any cervical cancer prevention strategy, 147,632 cases of cervical cancer will ultimately occur within the cohort. The implementation of cervical cancer prevention strategies, including screening alone, HPV vaccination alone, or cervical screening in combination with HPV vaccination w as projected to prevent 15,641, 80,750 or 87,862 c ases of cervical cancer, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of cervical screening and HPV vaccination generated the highest reduction of deaths caused by cervical cancer (19,359), followed by HPV vaccination alone (17,541) and screening alone (4,00 5) (Table 2). Table 2. The impact of cervical cancer prevention strategies on incidence and mortality cases over a 58 -years period Clinical Parameters No Intervention Screening Cervical Screening & HPV Vaccination HPV Vaccination Cumulative incidence 4,005 19,359 17,541 The lifetime NPV for the study cohort of Indonesian 12 -year -old females is illustrated in Table 3 for the three prevention strategies. All three strategies resulted in a positive NPV. HPV vaccination in combination with cervical screening generates the highest NPV for the government (I$2,031,786,000), followed by HPV vaccination only (I$1,860,783,000) and cervical screening alone (I$375,244,000). Indirect tax produces the highest revenue for the government compared to direct tax, social - or health -security contributions. With respect to HPV -related governments' expenses, the highe st saving is generated by treatment cost savings. HPV vaccination in combination with cervical cancer screening results in the highest healthcare cost -savings. Similarly, the combined prevention strategy resulted in the highest savings in terms of social s ecurity costs. All prevention strategies resulted in increased governments' expenses in terms of health security and pension costs. Assessment of the broader economic consequences of HPV prevention from a government -perspective: A fiscal analytic approach 151 7 Chapter 7 152 Fig 1 illustrates the results of the univariate sensitivity analyses evaluating the influence of several input parameters on the NPV. The analysis shows that inflation and discount rate are the most influential parameters in this study [data not shown]. The further analysis illustrates that NPV is also sensitive to GDP (as a measure of earnings) and tax compliance. Health and social security membership, the percentage of earnings consumed, and percentage of work -related accident premium are considered as no n-influential parameters to the NPV. Discussion Implementation of population -based healthcare intervention unambiguously results in fiscal costs due to changes in morbidity and mortality that influence national accounts over the lifetime of the cohort. However, similar to other public investments, inves tment in healthcare interventions may also result in measurable, long -term fiscal benefits (i.e. tax revenue) attributed to changes in population health that may outweigh or considerably Assessment of the broader economic consequences of HPV prevention from a government -perspective: A fiscal analytic approach 153 7 offset the costs (52). In this study , we evaluated how different levels of investment in HPV prevention influence the Indonesian governments' fiscal accounts. The study showed that investing in HPV vaccination in combination with cervical screening yields long -term fiscal benefits for the Ind onesian government. These results are supplementary to a previously published study on the cost -effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention strategies in Indonesia (24). Both studies suggest that cervical cancer prevention strategies are not only beneficial for the health of Indonesian women, they also improve the efficiency of healt hcare resource use and have a long -term fiscal benefit for the government by increasing the quality and quantity of the human capital and thus by increasing the tax base in the country compared to not investing in HPV prevention. The main clinical benefit of cervical cancer prevention programmes is the reduction of morbidity and mortality (16,53 -55). In traditional health -economic analyses the comparative clinical benefits and associated costs would be re flected in the incremental cost - effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per quality -adjusted survival as a re sult of vaccination. The latter ratio responds to the question of which is the most efficient use of healthcare resources for a given healthcare budget. A cost -effectiveness analysis may also quantify productivity losses from premature mortality and/or abs enteeism or presentism and thus reflect the benefits from a societal perspective which are distinct from benefits accrued to government. In the model described here , we apply the tax burden to reflect the proportion of lifetime earnings that are transferre d to the government to reflect fiscal benefits. The underlying assumption of taking a broader economic analytic perspective with emphasis on fiscal effects is that changes in health status or the prevention of infectious diseases have several external eff ects. The benefits of HPV prevention imply that more women who would be able to work thus, gain more earnings and pay more taxes and security premiums for the government. As a result of this, it is expected that the prevention of HPV infection and HPV - related diseases will yield increased governmental fiscal revenues from (direct and indirect) taxes and also (health and social) security insurance premium. Moreover, there are significant cost -savings resulting from reduced need for cervical cancer treatment which is captured in conventional cost -effectiveness analyses and also demonstrated by application of a \"government -perspective\" framework to assess different HPV investment strategies. A key limitation of this type of study is that it is largely dependen t on the mathematical modeling of long -term clinical, economic and fiscal parameters. Although the population - based model included high -quality clinical -trial data, including vaccine and VIA screening efficacy on incidence and mortality, further model vali dation using observed -country -specific data could still further assure the outcomes of the model. However, the Indonesia -specific observational information is not available. Such further validation and comparing our model with more sophisticated models fro m other countries with better data availability remains an option for future research. Chapter 7 154 Some of the key parameters dynamically change over time in the real life. Sensitivity analyses may address some of the uncertainty around these parameters. However, fur ther observational data may be needed to assess the real -life fiscal effect of HPV prevention programmes. In addition, the current analysis does not take into account the effects of herd immunity, inequalities in access to health -care services due to socio -economic and regional differences, further distinctions in specific stages of both pre -cancer and cervical cancer, nor the benefits that HPV vaccination may have in terms of (i) protection of males and (ii) prevention of genital warts. By conducting a br oader economic analysis, evidence is produced to inform analyses regarding the cross -sectorial allocation of resources and perhaps the transfer of funds from other sectors of the public economy to universal population -based vaccination and screening progra mmes. The evidence generated in this study may address the affordability of implementing an HPV prevention program in Indonesia. Our study results suggest that investments in HPV prevention programmes may generate epidemiological benefits that translate i nto health -economic and fiscal benefits for the Indonesian government that may fully offset the investment costs and thus may have a positive impact on national accounts in the long -run.

In 2012, the total incidence and mortality for all types of HPV -related cance rs were over 2 and 1 million, respectively (3). From the patient perspective, HPV -related cancers extensively reduce not only the health -related quality of life (HRQoL) but also social interaction capability and personal income (1,4-6). From the government perspective, there are several consequences of HPV -related cancer including the increase of expenses for cancer treatments and significant reductions in the national revenues , especially fro m income taxes. Since the correlation between cervical cancer and HPV infection is considered as the strongest among HPV -related cancers (7-11), it apparently becomes an acceptable model on managing HPV -related cancers in general. In addition, several findings showed that the preventi on of HPV infection will indeed \"evidence -based\" reduce the incidence of cervical cancer (12-16). Therefore, the initial recommendation on HPV -related cancer management is HPV vaccination for the pre -sexually -active -period girls (13), with sexual contact being considered as the main transmission route of HPV infection. Basically, there are two available vaccines in the market: Cervarix (a bivalent vaccine containing HPV16 and HPV18 manufactured vaccine containing HPV6, HPV11, by Merck & Co.) , Gardasil is currently being upgraded into Gardasil -9, which contains more types of its main purpose of preventing the infection of HPV16 and HPV18, Cervarix offers an additional benefit in prevention of other types infection from hrHPV through cross -protection (21,22) , while Gardasil -9 offers not only protection from all recognized hrHPV but also HPV6 and HPV11 which are responsible for genital warts (23-25). Since the development of cervical cancer generally requires a long period of time (7), a previous recommendation on cervical cancer prevention strategy concerns cervical screening, intended to detect the early stages of cervical cancer as well as pre -cancer stages (26,27) . The screening provides its optimum benefit when immediate treatment for the pre - cancer or early stage of cervical cancer is implemented (26,28) . Cytology -based cervical screening (pap -smear) has been widely implemented a nd its effectiveness in preventing the incidence and mortality related cervical cancer has been evidenced (15,16,29) . Yet, the implementation may be complex and non -optimal, and highly skilled health -care providers, advanced technology , and high costs are required (30). Therefore, several alternative methods are offered with their own advantages an d disadvantages, including visual inspection and HPV DNA screening (15). While visual inspection (either using Acetic Acid or Lugol Iodine) offer simpler requirements, low cost and low sensitivity (15,27,31) , HPV DNA screening provides a higher efficacy, less invasive method but high cost for its implementation (13,15) . Chapter 8 164 Likely, in order to achieve its maximum benefit, both HPV vaccination and cervical screening should be provided - optimally for free - on the national scale of, for example, Indonesia. However, various issues exist with regards to its implementation in a c ountry. The costs, cost-effectiveness, acceptance and preparedness of health care providers are some of the main issues that have to be handled by the governments (13,32,33) , with health care systems' organizations and political will being considered as the ultimate key factors for an adequate cervical cancer prevention policy. Notably, the political willingness in Indonesia to form one national health care system provides a solid foundation for cervical cancer prevention strateg y, as analyzed in this thesis. Let's however first turn to lessons learn ed from the Dutch situation. Lesson learned from a developed country: the Dutch setting Health technology Assessment in the Netherlands In order to ensure broad coverage of and equit y in health care services, the social health insurance system has once been implemented in the Netherlands and is under continuous revision (34). All residents are protected by basic health insurance provided by insurance companies under the health insurance law. Health services which are essential for the community are provided for fr ee and medicines are reimbursed (despite a modest \"eigen bijdrage\" or own payment). There are 3 main bodies involved in the drug reimbursement system in the Netherlands: (i) The Ministry of Health, Welfare & Sports (\"Volksgezondheid, Welzijn & Sport\", VWS) , which is responsible for the overall pharmaceutical policy and decides the maximum wholesale price, reimbursement status and the price of pharmaceuticals; (ii) The Medicines Evaluation Board (\"College ter Beoordeling van Geneesmiddelen\", CBG), responsibl e for the evaluation of pharmaceuticals and providing the marketing authorization; (iii) and The Health Care Insurance Board (\"College voor Zorgverzekeringen\", CVZ; recently transformed into \"Zorginstituut Nederland\") which advises the Ministry of VWS on t he reimbursement of the medicines. This decision -making process is applied for not only for drug reimbursement but similar approaches exist for other areas of health -related policies, such as the Dutch National Immunization Program (\"Rijksvaccinatieprogram ma\", RVP) (35). In the Netherlands, the use of Health technology assessment (HTA) as a polic y consideration in the decision -making process has been introduced since the early 80's, although only intensi fied in the early 21st century (36). This introduction was initiated in order to deal with the development of expensive interventions and ensure its cost -effectiveness (37). The cost - effectiveness evidence will obviously support the clinical evidence from clinical trials and provides a comprehensive overview on how the new pharmaceuticals, includi ng vaccines, will impact the national budget. Furthermore, to provide comparable and standardized cost - effectiveness studies, guidelines on conducting cost -effectiveness analysis for the Netherlands were launched on several occasions, inclusive revised gui delines in 2015 issues by \"Zorginstituut Nederland\" (38). Nevertheless, since a formal cost -effectiveness threshold General Discussion : Introducing Human Papillomavirus vaccine in Indonesia: A comprehensive review and policy recommendation 165 8 has never been explicitly provided, cost -effectiveness evidence only impacts to a limited extent and several further aspects, including social and political issues, could considerably influence the decision -making process. Cervical cancer prevention in th e Netherlands The introduction of cervical screening in the Netherlands was started in 1976 using cytology testing for women aged 35 to 53 years old with three years intervals. The strategy was modified in 1994, extending the age range into 30 to 60 years old and lengthening the interval into the range of 3 to 5 years. This modification was intended to not only increase the screening coverage and participation rate but also reduce the interval between initial testing and retesting. Additionally, this modifi cation was likely performed as well to keep the cervical screening cost -effective (39). Since 2013, a self -testing kit is provided by the Ministry for women who do not want to make an appointment for a cytology -based test (40). The overall performance of cervical screening in the Netherlands is ac ceptable (40). Approximately 800,000 women are invite d to do the screening and 400 HPV -related cervical cancer deaths are prevented by the screening annually (40). In addition, a new technology, namely HPV -DNA screening has been introduced since 2016 (41), with the aim to detect the presence of hrHPV including HPV16 and HPV 18. A substantial advantage of HPV -DNA screening compared to cytology -based screening is that HPV -DNA testing is less invasive and hopefully it will increase the number of women who accept the screening in the future and so generate even more benefit to the female populatio n in the Netherlands. According to a recommendation from The Dutch Health Council (\"Gezondheidsraad\"), the addition of the HPV vaccine in the RVP for young girls aged 12 to 13 years old and for 13 to 16 years old girls as a catch -up program has been implem ented (35,42) since 2009. Technically, invitations are sent to all girl s who turn 13 years old and previously, three doses of HPV vaccine are provided for free at the Municipal Public Health Services (\"Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst\", GGD) and at local Youth and Family Centres (\"Centrum voor Jeugd en Gezin\", CJG). With regard to the performance of the program, vaccination coverage was considered poor at the early stages of its implementation (35). The vaccination coverage in the first year of implementation was a round 50% while vaccine coverages for the other vaccines in the RVP are generally around 95%. Several issues were considerably influencing the declination of the vaccine, including low socioeconomic status, religious groups (so -labeled \"Bible Belt\") and se veral ethnic groups. However, in later years the vaccination coverage was gradually increasing to 61% on 2014 (43). Several strategies have been developed, considered and implemented to increase the vaccination coverage, including reduction of the number of doses from three to two doses after several major studies showed that there is no significant difference of vaccine efficacy in preventin g HPV infection between 3 - and 2 -dose schedules (44-46). Additionally, a cost -Chapter 8 166 effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination on other types of HPV -related cancers suggested that vaccination for boys could also be promising, especially when the coverage of vaccination on girls is relatively low (47,48) . Lesson learned from other low and middle income countries With respect to its implementation, high -income countries, for example the Netherlands, are able to support, optimize and advocate the implementation of the best option of cervical cancer prevention strategies. Low and middl e-income countries (LMICs), such as Indonesia, still encounter some classical issues hampering implementation, including infrastructure, human resources and budget (49). Nevertheless, several studies on cervic al cancer prevention strategies, particularly HPV vaccination, in developing countries showed a promising benefit of implementation for patients, government, and society as a whole (50- 54). Yet, next to issues regarding the introduction of HPV vaccination in L MICs, also sustainability of the programme presents an important consideration (29,33, 55). Challenges and opportunities Regarding the introduction of HPV vaccine in LMICs, several challenges, including sociocultural, health care and political systems, are commonly mentioned. Identify challenges related to the introduction of HPV vaccina tion in LMICs is an initial step in finding the most appropriate and cost -effective approach to HPV vaccination. If these challenges are faced, opportunities can be grabbed to work towards widespread implementation to achieve major benefits at the populati on level. Below, I will address the challenges now one by one. Sociocultural aspects Barriers and/ or opportunities which influence the uptake and coverage of the vaccine were identified including low knowledge of cervical cancer, parental concerns, stigma, target age and group, community sensitization and advocacy (11). Knowledge on cervical cancer and HPV infections in LMICs are considered to strongly vary (59). A study in Tanzania showed that health workers heard about cervical cancer and HPV infection but the details were often incomplete and inaccurate (60). Studies from Tanzania, Kenya and Ghana showed that parents have limited knowledge on cervical cancer, but do recognize the disease as a deadly illness, a serious threat for their daughters and causing physical problems or stress (58,60,61) . In addition, parents were also questioned on the vaccines' effectiveness, the safety of the injection procedure and the side effects of the vaccine on the reproduction systems (57,58,61) . Most of the parents were willing to accept the vaccination when the vaccine is provided for free (or at an acceptable price) and as least doses as possible (58,61) . Studies from Indonesia also showed that there was high acceptance o f HPV vaccination (96.1%) in Indonesia among parents with Surabaya (98.7%) and Bali (97.7%) (57). This reflects an important opportunity for Indonesia since the question General Discussion : Introducing Human Papillomavirus vaccine in Indonesia: A comprehensive review and policy recommendation 167 8 on whether young girls are going to be vaccinated is generally driven by parents' decisions (62). Health care system With regards to the Indonesian health care system, limited numbers of high -skill health care providers, high workloads of health -care providers in the facility, vaccine and equipment shortages, and low interaction in general between adolescents and health -care providers are common issues in LMICs even before the HPV vaccine is included in the vaccination program (56,57,60,62) . Lack of personnel and high workload of health care professionals in the primary health -care facilities contribute to issues, as well as the low performance of vaccination in general (63,64) . With the supply and proportional regional distribution of health -care professionals being highly correlated with high vaccination coverage (63,64) , the situation is far from ideal in LMICs and in general this condition is difficult to achieve by LMICs. In addition, several issues which are commonly faced by the health care providers in LMICs, including vast and difficult to reach areas and high dens ity of population, still exist (65). Therefore, a policy to support the distribution of health -care providers nationwide and well -established transportation methods are require d to overcome these issues. Vaccines shortage immediately generates lower coverage and most importantly lower effectiveness of the overall vaccination (66-68). The shortage of equipment, such as syringes, consequently may necessitate the use of 1 syringe for several girls which is considered a high -risk method of vaccine delivery (56,60,62) . A potential strategy to prevent such shortages of both vaccines and its equipment involves establishing a long -term agreement with both manufacturer and distributor regard ing its provision. In addition, the fact that adolescents have low interaction in general with health care services and potential low -awareness on their future reproductive health could decrease the acceptance of HPV vaccination. At even younger ages highe r acceptance on vaccination in the Indonesian population my exist though (57). Therefore, a school -based educational activity (56) and promotion using media (television, radio or the internet) were identified as the most preferred methods on sensitizing the population with regards to cervical cancer and HPV vaccination, inclusive targeting pre -adolescents (55,57,61) . Additionally, stressing the introduction of HPV vaccination as cervical cancer prevention strategy instead of addressing the sexually transmitted infection (STI) aspects is instru mental for a successful program. Political system A valid and reliable process of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is expected to provide sufficient consideration on new health technologies as required by societies (69-71). This would also apply to HPV vaccination. However, the implementation of HTA as one of the Chapter 8 168 main consideration in the health -related decision -making process has not been established in several LMICs (72). There are several limitations regarding the implementation of HTA in LMICs such as limited evidence in the country -specific context, limited numbers of HTA bodies performing such studies and the lack of regulations on how HTAs w ill exactly impact the decision -making process in the country. Often, the implementation of a new health policy in LMICs is strongly driven by political considerations of the government (73). A strong political commitment could simply be enough for the provision of HPV vaccination in a country. This com mitment can be influenced by the availability of country -specific evidence such as epidemiological and economic burden of cervical cancer, country -specific of vaccines' cost -effectiveness, and of course the impact of the vaccination on the national budget (74). The fact that HPV infection and cervical cancer are related to sexual transmitted disease, women disease and also not included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by WHO makes the prioritization of HPV vaccine as the cervical cancer prevention in LMICs is a challenging subject. Additionally, in the perspective of current national budgets, it is difficult to make HPV vaccination as the government's priority since the fiscal benefit of the vaccines will be shown in the next few decades. In addition, there is another option which is potentially considered more suitable for LMICs since it is cheaper and require s less trained health care providers; i.e. cervical screening using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) (31). Nevertheless, comprehens ive assessments, including long -term cost -effectiveness analysis, fiscal analysis and budget impact analysis, on the implementation of HPV vaccination showed that the addition of HPV vaccination on top of screening in LMICs is the most favorable strategy of cervical cancer prevention str ategy as well as potentially being affordable (this thesis) (28,65,75) . Cost -related considerations of HPV vaccination delivery for LMICs: Indonesia as a case reference Despite several efforts having been done by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) Alliance (76) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Revolving Fun d (77,78) to facilitate the introduction of HPV vaccination in low -income countries and Latin Amer ica / Caribbean countries, respectively, providing two doses (formerly three doses) of HPV vaccination is still an expensive option for LMICs, including Indonesia. Although GAVI and PAHO revolving fund provide significantly lower prices of vaccines for its introduction, this reduction is considered as a part of the introduction and recurrent budgets have to be borne by a country. Additionally, there are other types of costs to consider which are required in the process of introduction and maintenance of HPV vaccination, including training, cold -chain improvement, supervision, service delivery etcetera (56). General Discussion : Introducing Human Papillomavirus vaccine in Indonesia: A comprehensive review and policy recommendation 169 8 Introduction and maintenance cost of HPV vaccination in Indonesia Additional costs related to the activities of introduction and maintenan ce of HPV vaccination in the LMICs covers micro -planning; i.e. a plan for vaccination activities at local levels considering accessibility, geography, population movements, and cultural characteristics, training for vaccine administrators, social mobilizat ion, information, education and communication (IEC), cold -chain improvement, wastage managements, service delivery and supervision (65,79,80) . For Indonesia, some advantages in the micro -planning activities may exist, as training for vaccine administrators will not be required since HPV vaccination will not be the first vaccination f or this age group (81). HPV vaccination could be delivered together with the sixth dose of diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus (DPT) vaccine since it has exactly the same target population, location of vaccination (school -based) and route of administration (intra muscular). The main component of HPV vaccines is made from a virus -like protein, not the whole part of the organism, which made the v accines to be considered as among the most stable of vaccines (17,19) . In addition, various studies, both in and out the laboratory, showed that in an acceptable period of time, HPV vaccines are rel atively stable even at higher temperatures (82). Therefore, an additional cost for cold chain may not b e required in the urban districts. However, the capital cost of the cold storage in the rural remote areas, such as provinces and district levels, do seem relevant and appropriate to take into account in the costings. Here, an additional cost to improve th e storage of HPV vaccines in every distribution stage is notably essential. Since one dose of HPV vaccine is packed in a single dose vial or pre -filled syringe dosage form (83) it will obviously need extra space for its storage and delivery. An additional IEC activity will be required since the messages are obviously different with all existing vaccination programme. This activity is also considered a challenging one s ince STI and even cervical cancer are considered as a scary, taboo or uncommon subject of discussion among the target groups population or population in general. Although large numbers of scientific evidence regarding the benefit and risk of HPV vaccinatio n for young girls population are available, the number and the spread of health care provider in the LMICs for IEC activity is considerably not sufficient to cover all the target population (84). Eventually, an extra time and effort, which are correlated to an additional service cost and allowance, are also needed for training, delivery, monitoring and supervision process of HPV vaccina tion implementation. Budget impact, cost -effectiveness analysis and fiscal consequences of HPV vaccination With respect to the impact of HPV vaccination policies on national accounts, significant increases in national expenses can be expected. The short -term budget impact of HPV vaccination will apparently not be favorable in the government perspective, however , the clinical and economic benefit of vaccination will show in the next few decades (85). Further Chapter 8 170 evaluations, in particular combined cost -effectiveness (75) and fiscal analysis (86), on a one - cohort female population in Indonesia showed that on the long term, HPV vaccination provides an acceptable incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) in both the societal and governmental perspective with potential huge fiscal benefits. Notably, the ICER was estimated at I$1,862 per QALY (75), whereas the Net Present Value (NPV) would be I$2.212.310.000 for a 10 -million females cohort (86). Providing prospective solutions to overcome challenges Inclusion of pharmaceutical industry on the national formulary submission process In 2013, the Indonesian Ministry of Health (MoH) launched the first national formulary covering all pharmaceuticals that have to be provided in the health care facilities (87). The review and evaluation of the national formulary have been scheduled at least once every 2 years and notably, the national formulary has been updated 2 times in the last two years (88,89) . Next to being performed regularly , the review process involves various stakeholders including clinicians, health economics experts, and policy makers to achieve a broad involvement of all these parties (90). Figure 1. The development and evaluation process of the National Formulary The evaluation process is started by the Directorate General of Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices of the MoH by requesting the list of new medicin es from health care facilities in the province and at district levels, health -care program managers, and health care professionals organizations. In all these levels of health care facilities, each party discusses and requests General Discussion : Introducing Human Papillomavirus vaccine in Indonesia: A comprehensive review and policy recommendation 171 8 medications which are require d in the daily practice. This request list, together with the supporting evidence, is submitted to the National Committee of Drug Evaluation. After the reviewing process, the committee makes a recommendation, consisting of the list of accepted medications, to the MoH. Ultimately, the new National Formulary will be established and formalized as the National Formulary in Indonesia. This formulary will be used as the standard reference by health care providers (from primary to tertiary) in the National health care system (90). Notably, the pharmaceutical company does not participate in this process. With respect to the national formulary evaluation pr ocess, an additional perspective from the pharmaceutical industry may considerably broaden the perception and interpretation of health -related problems, and possibly lead to innovative solutions in Indonesia. Pharmaceutical industries commonly have potenti ally differentiating ideas, specific interests, and practical issues on how products or services should be provided in the health care facilities and implemented as a national policy (desired revenues, stocks , and cold chain). Industry involvement can then be seen as an advantage with the receiving different types of inputs, information on feasibility and potential macroeconomic benefits. Finally, with a clear and accountable requirement in the decision -making process of national formularies for industries, benefits seem achievable for the government as well as for the society as a whole. Partial implementation based on the incidence rate and budget in the regional level As Indonesia is not included in the list of low -income countries nor located on the Amer ican continent, there will not be any advantages or stimulants from neither GAVI nor PAHO for the implementation of HPV vaccination in this country (76,78). Therefore, the introduction of HPV vaccine for all regions in the country will need a huge amount of national budget to be invested in the vaccination program. With the incidence rate of 17.3 per 100,000 population in 2012, the burden of cervical cancer in Indonesia is considerably high (3). However, the burden seems not equal among regions with the provinces of Yogyakarta and Riau islands as the two ones with the highest prevalence (1.5 per million) among provinces in Indonesia (91). in addition, the spread of the population is obviously also not equal with the provinces of Jakarta and Yogyakarta as the first and second most populated regions in Indonesia, respectively (92). Ergo, investment will pose differing requirements in different regions as well as that benefits may differ. In addition, t here are disparities regarding the regional budgets which influence the capability of each province on providing health care services in their own region (93). Regional budgets ranged from more than 6 billion International Dollars for the West Java province to 374 million international dollars for Gorontalo province on Sulawesi. As the implement ation of HPV vaccination requires a huge amount of budget to invest, a stepwise implementation of HPV vaccination guided by the two indicators of regional Chapter 8 172 prevalence/incidence rate and regional budget could be an acceptable consideration since the full -fledged instantaneous national level of implementation is challenging. A strict control on vaccine distribution Consisting of more than 17.000 islands from Sabang to Aceh province and from Merauke to Papua, the production, distribution , and delivery of pharm aceuticals, especially vaccines poses a challenging issue in Indonesia. With regards to actual vaccination policy implementation, there are further potential problems which could occur, including vaccine counterfeiting (94). Counterfeit vaccines could possibly be found in the manufacturing phase, as well as still during distribution and delivery. In general, counterfeit vaccines is considered an international problem. There are various potential negative effects possibly occurring due to the presence of counterfeit vaccines, including suboptimal clinical outcomes as the most important effect. Other possible effects, such as negative publicity of the vaccination campaign, serious or even fatal side effects and economic loss, can be considered additional burdens for both society and the government. For example, on June 2016, Indonesian authorities found a counterfeit vaccine which had b een manufactured and distributed for more than 12 years and which has since been considered as the biggest leak in vaccination practice in Indonesia (95,96) . Three important lessons could be drawn from this case. The first one is that preferably expensive vaccines seem the main target of counterfeit. Secondly, vaccine price is the main driving factor for vaccine purchasing and cheaper counterfeit vaccines as such have attraction. The last point concerns the authority, the National Agency of Drugs and Food Control (NADFC or BPOM), which seems limited since BPOM is responsible for pharmaceutical registration, their coverage of tas ks too broad and workload too high. In addition, problems on vaccine storage could occur not only at the health care facility level but also at the level of distributors' storage. Strengthening the vaccine distribution control by BPOM is considered an urge nt issue, which could safeguard the legal distribution chain and assure the originality and quality of the vaccine. Health promotion by private health care provider Since the information related to HPV infection and/or cervical cancer is not commonly available, HPV vaccination campaigns and/or continuous education should be an important component of the vaccine introduction policy in Indonesia (33,59,60) . An active health promotion should be performed regular ly by local health care providers, the community health center (pusat kesehatan masyarakat / puskesmas) and several private health -care providers, including general practitioners, community pharmacists and midwi ves. As the workload of the community health center is generally too high, intensification of the role of private health care providers in the health care promotion activities could be a promising option. This activity can be included as part of the agreement between health care prov iders and the Healthcare and Social Security Agency (Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan General Discussion : Introducing Human Papillomavirus vaccine in Indonesia: A comprehensive review and policy recommendation 173 8 Sosial or BPJS) as the public agency established to implement the national social security program in Indonesia. Modified school -based administration strategy, According to se veral studies regarding the delivery methods of vaccination in developing countries, school -based vaccination apparently showed as the better administration strategy compared to clinical based strategy (33,55) . A school -based strategy could also work in Indonesia since the attendance rate of young girls to schools is considerably high. In addition, the coverage of DTP vaccination, which is intended for the same age group of the population as targete d for HPV -vaccines, based on the same strategy shows satisfactory levels. However, the HPV vaccine has a different number of administration route , concerns 2 or 3 doses in total and requires between -doses intervals of 6 months. A national exam provides fur ther options. This exam, which is mandatory for all students in Indonesia (97), is performed at the same time in the whole regions in the country. The attendance rates of the students dur ing exams are almost 100%. A school -based administration strategy combined with the national exam might generate the optimal coverage of HPV vaccination in Indonesia. Technically, 6 months before the exam and the last day of the exam could be the best timi ng for the first and the second dose of administration, respectively. Notably, new data illustrate that 2 administration may suffice (44,45) . Discussion, value of information and policy recommendation for Indonesia Full, potential and near eradication of several infectious diseases, including polio, tetanus , and measles, is considered as the success of vaccination in the past. In Indonesia, the Expanded Program on Immunization has been implemented since 1977. Various immunization -specific strategies have been undertaken to gradually improve the achievement of na tional vaccination, such as the National Immunization Week (Pekan Imunisasi Nasional, PIN) for polio, the Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (MNTE) campaign, a crash program for measles immunization (98) and the five -in-one vaccine for children in 2013 (99). Concerning its high clinical, so cietal and economic burden, HPV -related cancer is considered as a prospective target for eradication by a next effective vaccination program in Indonesia (3). Potentially, this can be achieve d in a highly cost -effective manner. Various prospective benefits have been estimated in studies on cost -effectiveness, concerning societal and health benefits (75), and fiscal analyses concerning impacts on national accounts (86) for of HPV vaccination in Indonesia. However, several challenges on its introduction and maintenance proc ess of vaccination should be identified and managed in order to gain optimal benefits, as laid out above. Chapter 8 174 An additional consideration on the urgency of HPV vaccination concerns the current policy on cervical cancer prevention with the VIA screening method, which is considered highly unsatisfactory (100) . Implementation of HPV vaccination on top of the cervical screening was shown to be cost -effective and not only reduces the cervical cancer -related burden, such as incidence, mortality and/or the treatment costs for the disease (75), but also increases the government's revenue from future taxes due to a larger productive population as the result of HPV vaccination. Although HPV vaccination provides promising outcomes for Indonesia, financing both the introduction and maintenance of HPV vaccin ation will require a high proportion of health care budgets. Yet, negotiations for the lower prices of the vaccines seems possible. While the original prices of the HPV vaccines for high -income countries are about $100 (101,102) , PAHO has agreem ents on $8.5 per dose for countries located on the American continent (103) . A further price reduction on the HPV vaccine s was achieved by GAVI by dealing the lowest price of $4.5 per dose for the quadrivalent vaccine from Merck & Co and $4.6 per dose for the bivalent vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline (104) . These price reductions illustrate the potentials for Indonesia to get a lower price for the HPV vaccines, enhanced by the negotiation po wer related to the high numbers of target populations in this country. Additionally, When vaccine prices could possibly be reduced by negotiation, two other steps are subsequently required to enhance the implementation of HPV vaccination in Indonesia. Firstly, a modification on the available guideline for the drug evaluation process for the national formulary is required to increase the competition among pharmaceutical companies and empower the role of the cost-effectiveness of these pharmaceuticals. In ad dition, the establishment of acceptable national or regional cost -effectiveness thresholds to assure the process of the drug selection process could be very beneficial. Secondly, provision of Indonesia -specific evidence on cervical cancer and HPV v accines, particularly on health economic evidence, will assist decision makers to make a valid and reliable locally -evidence - based policies. Methodologically, further work on that presented in this thesis could concern Value of Information (VoI) analysis. VoI coul d typically be the next issue in the decision making process as the provision of Indonesia -specific evidence could indeed generate better quality information on several parameters in the model, reducing their uncertainty but coming at the costs of further research. Dealing with uncertainty is an important subject as the consequences of a wrong decision could be very costly and failing to save lives that potentially could be saved (105,106) . Therefore, research prioritization based on formal VoI should be the next task in order for the government to support the decision -making process in Indonesia.

Therefore, safe sexual behaviors considerably prevent the transmission of HPV. There are two groups of HPV that have been identified: the lowrisk HPV (lrHPV), including HPV type 6 and 11, is responsible for genital warts and highrisk HPV (hrHPV), including 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, is considerably related to various cancers including cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile, oral, and nasopharyngeal cancer. These cancers, particularly cervical cancer, yield high clinical, societal and economic burden for the society in general. The two contradictory findings, that cervical cancer is a preventable disease but its burden remains high, suggest that a comprehensive prevention is required. The World Health Organization recommends HPV vaccination and cervical screening as primary and secondary prevention of cervical cancer, consecutively. However, the implementation of those two recommendations entails problematical requirements, especially in lowresource countries, including wellestablished healthcare infrastructure, high skill human resources, political will, availability of scientific evidence and of course budget to provide and maintain the prevention policy. In order to provide scientific evidence, this thesis generally provides comprehensive findings on how cervical cancer prevention, mainly HPV vaccination, will affect not only clinical but also economic aspects in a country, using Indonesia as the reference case. Initially, we explored the healtheconomic aspects of HPV vaccination in the Netherlands (chapter 2) to provide a general insight and possibly a model on how the costeffectiveness profile is of cervical cancer prevention in developed countries, such as the Netherlands. Various strategies of HPV vaccination, including vaccination for older women, and cervical screening, particularly pap smear, were also explored. Although several parameters, such as vaccine price and discount rate, were very important for the outcome measurement, the general finding from this review was that HPV vaccination in combination with cervical screening is a costeffective strategy in the Netherlands. In chapter 3, we investigated the immunogenicity of HPV vaccines on stimulating hrHPV specific antibody in Asian populations using metaanalysis. Furthermore, the safety profiles, Summary 188 covering local and systemic adverse events, of the vaccines were also considered in the same population. This study found that HPV vaccines were highly beneficial for not only uninfected population, the main target population, but also infected individuals. In addition, the safety profiles were considerably acceptable and these findings were apparently comparable with other findings from many other countries. A comprehensive review, on how health economic studies of cervical cancer prevention in South East Asian were performed, was presented in chapter 4. This review describes the methods used in the included studies in detail, such as study design, perspective, time horizon, HPV vaccination methods, cervical screening methods, discount rate and sensitivity analysis. In addition, six studies clearly reported that the incremental costeffectiveness ratio indicated favourable costeffectiveness for The Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand according to the threshold recommended by the Commission on Macroeconomics in Health. An observational study was performed in chapter 5 to get information on Healthrelated Quality of Life (HRQoL) of HPVrelated patients including cervical, uterine, head and neck, anogenital , and nasopharyngeal cancer in Margono Public Hospital, Purwokerto, Indonesia. A pilot study was previously performed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the translated European Quality of Life5 Dimensions (EQ5D) questionnaire in the specific Indonesian setting. After the validation processes were finished, all eligible patients were visited and inform consent was performed with regards to their willingness to join the study. It was found that HPVrelated cancers moderately decreased the HRQoL, represented by the utility index, of cancer's patients while the highest and lowest reduction of utility were experienced by head and neck and uterine cancer, respectively. The first decision analytic model, using an Indonesian population based Markov model, was developed in chapter 6. This model was used to evaluate the longterm clinical and economic benefits of cervical cancer prevention consisting HPV vaccination and cervical screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) in Indonesia. In this study, we found that the addition of HPV vaccination on top of VIA screening substantially increases the clinical benefit as it reduces the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in Indonesia. In addition, both strategies, VIA screening alone and its combination with HPV vaccination, were evidently costeffective according to the recommended threshold (<3x GDP). Nevertheless, these outcomes were influenced by several parameters including discount rate, cervical cancer treatment cost and utility score used in the model. Further assessment of the benefit of HPV vaccination, VIA screening alone and the combination of both prevention strategies according to Indonesian government perspective were explained in chapter 7. This study was performed since the traditional cost effectiveness analysis could not fully grasp the impact of health technology on the national accounts, which is considered as one of the government's main concerns. Therefore, the fiscal analysis approach, combining human capital and costbenefit analysis, essentially Summary 189 offers a less complicated analysis for the government that may be closer to their daily considerations. This study was performed by calculating the net revenue, including income taxes, health, and social insurance premium, and expenses, including cervical cancer treatment, pension, health and social insurance premiums for a public servant, of the Indonesian government. Finally, the Net Present Value (NPV) representing the predicted benefit/loss generated by the investment on cervical cancer prevention policy was calculated. Our study showed that the implementation of cervical cancer prevention policy in Indonesia will provide a substantial revenue (or saving) for the government of I$2.031.786.000 annually. This additional revenue was obtained since there would be more people who live and work longer, earning more income and thus paying more taxes and, of course, reduction on cervical cancer treatment will substantially save government expenses. The last chapter (chapter 8), provides a general discussion of the thesis and thus proposes several recommendations with regards to the implementation of HPV vaccination in Indonesia. Initially, this chapter discusses the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) process and the cervical cancer prevention in The Netherlands to provide a general overview of how it has been implemented in a developed country as it could possibly be the role model for Indonesia. Furthermore, various opportunities, challenges and costrelated issues to the implementation of HPV vaccination in developing countries were also presented in order to provide a general overview if HPV vaccination would be fully implemented in Indonesia. Finally, some policy recommendations, including inclusion of pharmaceutical industry in the national formulary submission process, partial implementation of HPV vaccination, a strict control on vaccine distribution, health promotion strategies, and modification in school based vaccine administration, were proposed based on the studies that have been performed, literature that has been reviewed and ideas that have been explored.

Acknowledgement 199 ______________________________________________________________ ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The uncertainty in doing a PhD is miraculously challenging. Being a student, employee, father, and husband is an awesome combination, therefore, I would say thanks to Allah SWT for all the bless and unlimited grace so that I had/have fun, a smooth and wonderful period in this wonderful country. A smooth and wellmanaged study process requires a good guidance from a great mentor. I would like to express the deepest appreciation to my supervisors, Prof Maarten J Postma, Prof Bob Wilffert and Dr. Jarir Atthobari who have given me the opportunity to do this PhD. Dear Maarten, Firstly, thank you for your willingness to accept me as your PhD student. Being your student is one of the most memorable experiences in my life. I would like to say thank you for your supportive, open mind and stimulative way of training so I can get new experiences, perspectives, knowledge and also greater willingness to provide an additional value to the society. You always came up with creative and innovative ways of thinking especially on solving any obstacles during my study. Another lesson is that being a fan of FC Groningen, we should not only have to be optimistic but also have to prepare for any results that we may not expect, that's also how science works. Again, I am grateful that you always support me both in academic and personal matters. Dear Jan \"Thank you\" is never enough to express my happiness as I have been extremely lucky to have you as my supervisor during my study. I learned a lot from you since you patiently guided me on how to critically and logically think about the research and presenting ideas in the paper. I will always remember all your lessons as substantial steps when doing research and working as an academic staff member after the PhD. Dear Bob, I always remember that the first communication with you is when we had a barbeque at your house during the company outing. I was embarrassed since we hadn\u00b4t an official meeting as Acknowledgement 200 2nd promotor and his student yet. However, I got an impression that you are a very nice and knowledgeable person and apparently, I was correct from the start. Thank you for your generosity and always being supportive as my 2nd promotor. Dear Pak Jarir, Thank you very much for introducing me to Maarten, it was an important step for me in pursuing my PhD in Pharmacoeconomics. Moreover, thank you for giving me a Dutch lesson during my Master project so it was, sort of, easier for me to adapt to the Dutch culture during my transition time in the Netherlands. Working and learning from people who have different expertise gave me not only an interesting experience but also expanded my perspective on science and research. Therefore, I would like to acknowledge my collaborators in this Thesis: Jan C Wilschut, B Septaningsih, your constructive comments, critics and suggestions were valuable contributions for this thesis. My friends and colleagues in the PTE2 unit: Auliya, Pepijn, Jos, Mehraj, Mas Christiaan, Neily, Judith, and Sofa, I have had a great time working and sharing the office with you.
