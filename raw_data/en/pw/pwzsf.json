Sacred ritual is an ancient universal practice of connecting with the truth in our heart and soul, thus Ceremony is accessible to all regardless of faith or belief system. With the intention of Ceremonial practice, a bond is created between the heart and mind- this simple ritual becoming an agreement with ourselves and that of a grander power. The power of Ceremony can propel one into better health in mind, body and spirit. Shamanic cultures around the world understand the importance of marking life's transitions through community, personal celebration and release. Ceremony unites deeply important archetypal forces like bonding, purification and severance. A Ceremony can be in dedication of atonement, healing, cleansing and purification, or marriage. A Ceremony can mark the beginning of manifesting a dream, honoring a life transition, or releasing past experiences. Ceremony can be used as part of the treatment program for dis-ease or ills including sexual abuse, infidelity, abortion, bereavement, eating disorders, and substance abuse. In Western culture, we experience Ceremony in our birthday celebrations, weddings, funerals, and some holidays. \"This is what rituals are for. We do spiritual ceremonies as human beings in order to create a safe resting place for our most complicated feelings of joy or trauma, so that we don't have to haul those feelings around with us forever, weighing us down. We all need such places of ritual safekeeping. And I do believe that if your culture or tradition doesn't have the specific ritual you are craving, then you are absolutely permitted to make up a ceremony of your own devising, fixing your own broken-down emotional systems with all the do-it-yourself resourcefulness of a generous plumber/poet.\" -Elizabeth Gilbert Possible Ceremonial Offerings TRADITIONAL ENERGY HEALING CEREMONY Traditional healing sessions combine Ceremony and hands-on work to bring renewed clarity, joy and insight into your whole being.
