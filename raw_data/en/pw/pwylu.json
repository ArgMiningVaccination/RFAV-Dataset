With real-time benefits, even be fore a prescription is written, the provider will have member-specific information available at their fingertips, including: Cost of a selected drug based on the member's plan coverage, deductible, and how much of the deductible the member has met Up to five clinically a ppropriate therapeutic alternatives, that may also be lower cost, generated from our datab ase of drug classes, mapped for clinical substitution and specific to the member's formulary Restrictions on the selected drug, such as prior authorization (PA), step therapy requirements, or quantity limits Whether the selected pharmacy is in network. OGB has the choice to opt-out of this offering. FOR PUBLIC USE 61 Additionally we can he lp reduce costs by targeting physicians who may not be meeting practice standards and intervening through several of our clinical solutions - which OGB may opt into or out of as well. Through our programs such as Pharmacy Advisor, we provide member-spe cific feedback and alternative therapy suggestions for specific prescribing issues. Inte rventions are evidence- based and encourage compliance with national clinical guidelines. Our advanced analytics allow us to identify physician outliers for intervention and partner with our clients on creating solutions that can influence physician behavior. C6 Describe how the Contractor will monitor and increase Plan Participant's prescription compliance. Adherence Program details provided separately. C7 What is the process for handling a non-preferred drug claim? Our clinical intervention and cost-containment program, designed to increase the use of generic and preferred brand drugs, includes online messaging to the pharmacist at the point of service across our all 68k pharmacies in our network. If an opportunity for substituting a generic or preferred brand -name drug presents itself, and OGB has opted for our intervention program, our online claims processing system generates a message to the pharmacist. Additionally, specifically at CVS Pharmacy, the information will be integrated into the pharmacist's workflow, making it easy to engage patients and inform them about potentially lower-cost alternatives, based on formulary coverage. If the member's FOR PUBLIC USE 62 prescription is for a medication not on the formulary, the CVS pharmacist will be able to request a prescription change from the provider at the click of a button. C8 How will the mix between retail and mail order prescriptions be optimized? With proper education and incentives, clients can reduce overall co sts and engage members into making the most a ppropriate decisions regarding their prescription benefit by optimizing the mix between retail and mail prescriptions. Length of prescription therapy serves as one of the main drivers of retail utilization. Members should obtain short-term prescriptions (e.g., for 30 days or fewer) in a retail pharmacy, since mail service's cost efficacies materialize when filling long-term, maintenance medication prescriptions. In addition, if a member's physician tries different drug therapies, obtaining a short-term supply of the medication at retail avoids wasting a long-term supply through mail service if the medication does not work. Members must have the proper financial/copay incentives to choose the best distribution channel that meets their needs, as well as the client's. For those situations in which mail service makes the most sense, we offer several options to maximize appropriate mail service use. Some clients also implement a stepped copay/coinsurance option based on days' supply to produce savings. We can work with you to minimize disruption to your FOR PUBLIC USE 63 members' routines but optimize the cost- effectiveness of the plan. C9 Describe the programs implemented to expedite conversion to newly-released generic medications. Provide examples. One of the ways we can help you increase the use of generics among your members is to educate them through personalized communication materials, informative website content, plan design pa rameters, and face-to- face consultation. We w ill proactively consult with you in developing a comprehensive plan to promote generic products well in advance of market release, which can include targeted patient mailings and messaging on member counseling information. Some examples include: Caremark.com - We have developed online tools including: -Interactive Savings Tools -Check Drug Cost -Save with alternative medications -eAlerts (text and email) with embedded savings messages. DAW 2 Calls - Target ed phone calls alerting brand users of generic availability DAW 2 Letters - Targeted, personalized FOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USE 67 identified after careful consideration of current market dynamics as well as future introductions to ensure the most appropriate and/or cost effective products are recommended. There may be potential rebate loss for those not aligned to our standard formulary; however, specifics relating to areas of customization would be required for the impact to be determined. Rebate impact and, if required, adjustments to pricing will be evaluated for client-specific customization. A dditionally, we will recommend potential strategies that influence rebate value when selecting products for inclusion to produce the lowest net cost. C16 Confirm that you are able to provide a monthly report of patients that have utilized a patient assistance program at a specialty pharmacy.

A 350,000-life client implemented Pharmacy Advisor Counseling for diabetes and experienced a improvement in optimal adherence over one year. After discontinuing Pharmacy Advisor Counseling, improvements from the first year beg an to reverse, with a decrease in opt imal adherence within nine months. Over time, members became less adherent to their medication. Based on a published study of our pilot data, we expect clinical metrics will return to pre-Pharmacy Advisor Counseling levels without ongoing monitoring and FOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USE 72 D4 What was the customer s ervice representative turnover rate for the last calendar year for the facility and/or dedicated team you are providing to OGB? The turnover rate for the entire Knoxville facility was 14.25% in 2019. D5 Confirm that you are willing to extend customer service hours for potential participants during OGB's annual enrollment period, special enrollments, and/or as requested by OGB.

D6 How are calls segmented (i.e., routing of inquiries by Plan, inquiries about claims, requests to identify network providers, generalized Plan Participant services questions, etc.)? By dialing the client-specific, toll-free number, members are routed to the appropriate self service option (depending on your plan set-up), some of which include: Order prescription refills Check the status of an order Check the cost of a particular drug Request plan balance information (OOP, etc.) Check eligibility Request a new ID card Locate a convenient retail network pharmacy Obtain an order form or claim form Request to speak to a live representative. D7 What methodologies (i.e., s ilent call monitoring) are employed to monitor and control the quality of service provided? In an effort to further e stablish CVS Caremark as a pre-eminent service provider in the health care industry, our Customer Care uses the Behavioral Analytics tool from Mattersight. Behavioral Analytics allows us to record, analyze, and interpret unstructured call content into structured, usable call data, which is then used for coaching and training opportunities. The application also provides an objective view of our service levels . We are able to analyze our member interactions based on substantial data, resulting in reduced service escalations through proactive serv icing. We can also utilize data from calls to enhance the member's experience and improv e the Customer Care Representative's performance. Quality assurance perfo rmance tracking is an FOR PUBLIC USE 73 important element in coaching and development for the indivi dual representative. Daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly data is disseminated to enable ongoing assessment and intervention. This data also helps identify customer and client trends. Accuracy measuremen t is present throughout call monitoring that is conducted by both our Quality Assurance Team and Supervisors. A combined minimum of eight calls are monitored for each Customer Care Representative. Supervisors utilize reporting from Behavior Analytics that may present challenges to the Customer Care Represent ative such as First Call Resolution result s, call back rate, and silent time along with behavior specific components. Their review is based on the coaching needs of the Customer Care Representative while our Quality Team's reviews are random. Targeting calls that have been identified as resulting in a call back or struggles interacting with a specific behavior has allowed us to coach and develop our Customer Care Representatives to provide personalized customer service. D8 Confirm that you will digi tally record all customer service calls at no additional cost to OGB. How long are the recordings kept? Confirmed.

All correspondence will be electronically imaged and routed to our network of mail service pharmacies for further processing. Sample Refill Order Form provided. FOR PUBLIC USE 77 E8 Describe the process for ordering refills by phone. How far in advance can Plan Participants order a refill? Our user-friendly application enables your members to select a pre scription for refill by entering the prescription number or by speaking the prescription drug nam e. If the prescription cannot be filled on the date the member calls, the caller is reminded tha t it is \"too soon to refill,\" and the system speaks the available refill date. The caller is also inform ed if the prescription has expired or if there are no remaining refills, the IVR will advise the me mber that a request will be sent to their physician to renew the prescription. This f eature helps members manage their prescription needs within the plan requirements. After each prescription is added to an order, the IVR system will advise the member of the remaining refills. If the medication requested is out of refills or if the prescription is expired, the IVR will still add them to that order but will advise the caller \"we will be contacting the doctor to request a new prescription on your behalf. This may extend t he normal processing time.\" Methods of payments include: Credit Card, Invoice, and Electronic Check. These payment types are conditional upon client approval. Refills can be charged to the credit card on file, or the caller can elect to enter an alternative credit card number. Pl an members will hear the estimated cost of their refill prescription order prior to its completi on. Any debit or credit amounts on file are stated to the member and calculated as part of the estimated cost. A confirmation number is provided with each refill order and can be used wh en checking the order status. For a typical mail order of 90 days, the member could fill as early as 13 days prior to the refill FOR PUBLIC USE 78 expiration for non-controlled (which can be adjusted per OGB's req uest) and 6 days early for any refillable contro lled medications. FOR PUBLIC USE 79 E9 Describe the quality controls in place to ensure accurate dispensing of prescriptions. How many levels of review take place and who conducts the reviews? We incorporate all items below during the dispensing process to help ensure accurate dispensing and effective administration of the mail service program. Bar Code Technology - A bar code is assigned to a prescription request upon receipt and is affixed to it as the order progresses through the mail proces s. After a bar code is assigned, a registered pharmacist verifies the prescription's info, including member identification, correct drug and potential interactions, dosage form, strength, quantity, therapeutic duplicates, and generic substitutes. Mail Receipt Procedure - The number of the member's prescriptions r eceived is identified on each mail service order form to help ensure integrity throughout the process. This initial check and notation is ver ified throughout the process prior to shippi ng, further ensuring the number of prescriptions received by our pharmacy matches the number sent to the member. Prescription Screening - As each prescription is entered into the adj udication system, an interactive verification occurs, helping ensure compliance with your plan design. Eligibility - Member e ligibility is certified online during the input of member and physician information. Member eligibility files are updated continuously a s new information is received from OGB. If a member is found to be ineligible, the computer will not allow the process to continue. Drug Interaction - We maintain a central database on all members using mail service. Once the order has been reviewed for quality control in the pharmacy, it is released to shipping, where final quality verification helps ensure that the right prescription is sent to the correct destination. FOR PUBLIC USE 80 All drug-to-drug interactions and drug-to-allergy interactions are detected online when a prescription is entered into the computer. If an interaction is detected, a brief description of it is provided to the pharmacist as well as reference sources for researching pharmacology before contacting the prescribing physician. Fraud and Abuse Cont rols - We screen orders through our computer system to detect evidence of program fraud or abuse. Each prescription is checked online before the filling process to verify eligib ility, detect potential early refill, and/or potent ial fraud or abuse. If there are any questions, a registered pharmacist will cont act the prescribing physician for authorization before the prescription is filled. Registered Pharmacist Quality Assurance Monitoring - All translation is verified by a registered pharmacist who confirms that the prescription image matches the info in the system: member, drug, drug strength, dosage form, instructions, prescriber, quantity, and refills. Once confirmed, the pharmaci st passes the prescription to the next step in the system. Pharmacists also perform product verification in the dispensing phar macy as well and will verify that the correct product is being dispensed either through image technology or visual inspection. FOR PUBLIC USE 81 E10 Describe online integration with retail pharmacies, if any, to prevent duplication and to identify potential adverse interactions. Our Mail Service progra m fully integrates with our retail service, ut ilizing the same online system as all of the pharmacies in our retail networks. The basic r equirements for any integrated retail and mail service program include utilization of a single eligibility file, member claims history file, plan database for claims adjudication, access to one set of drug utilization review edits, and integrated reporting and billing. Enrollment/Eligibility - You will enjoy ease of enrolling eligible members for retail and mail service through a single submission of eligibility. We will maintain an integrated retail and mail eligibility file for you in an online system to support member verification at the point of dispensing. Every claim submitted by either the mail service pharmacy or a retail pharmacy accesses the same eligi bility file for member verification. Data Capture/Reporting - Integrated retail and mail claims data are readily available to you through our data management platforms. Our integrated claims dat abase facilitates the storage, linkage, and rapid retrieval of prescription information and other health data, regardless of the distribution channel. We offer online and ad hoc query c apabilities, drill-down options, and industry-leadi ng reporting functions that apply in the retail and mail service environments. These tools identify management needs, target interventions, and measure program results. Interventions - Our integrated retail and mail service pharmacy progr ams combine a variety of services designed to maximize cost saving opportunities and enhance member satisfaction. In addition, our ability to deliver an integrated FOR PUBLIC USE 82 approach to therapeutic interchange in both retail and mail environments is a unique differentiator that can benefit your bottom-line. Drug Utilization Review (DUR) - Our mail service and retail netwo rk pharmacies access a common database for conc urrent DUR point-of- dispensing messages, to ensure that the member receives the most clinically appropriate drug product, regardless of distribution channel. Each member's claim history is a completely integrated drug profile t hat can be shared in real time with ancillary providers. This profile includes information regar ding all prescriptions we process for the member. OGB-dedicated Customer Care Service - OGB plan participants have 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a- week access to a pharmacist or an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) unit. With one toll-free call, the member receive s personalized service to locate the nearest retail pharmacy or to answer questions about retail or mail claims, including up-to-the-minute verification of a mail claim's status at any point in the dispensing process. Customer care representatives have online access to integrated retail and mail service data, claims hist ory, eligibility (current and historical), plan guidelines, deductible status, copay levels, pharmacy participation, and mail service prescription quotes. Account Services - We will provide you with the highest levels of support and resources. Your account services te am employs a matrix organization to provide you with the appropriate level of expertise in each component of your program. Consistent Claims Auditing Procedures - Retail and mail service claims dat a submitted to us are reviewed and subject to a udit by our Pharmacy FOR PUBLIC USE 83 Performance departmen t. Auditing procedures bring considerable value to clients with recovery efforts and reliability, and to participating pharmacies with education and deterrence mechanisms. Our integrated mail and retail services reduces your overall costs while engaging your members to make better decisions about their health care. For you, this means fewer calls about prescription coverage to your benefits professionals. For your members, it means excellent clinical services in both the retail and mail service environments. FOR PUBLIC USE 84 E11 Describe drug safety policies as they relate to safe delivery of prescriptions that may have environmental limitations or be subject to environmental requirements (i.e., temperature, etc.). Medications that require refrigeration are packaged in a moisture-barrier bag to protect the packaging and print. C old chain shipments utilize either a packout c ontaining frozen gels and protective pads or a combination of unfrozen and frozen gel packs. The unfrozen gel packs are placed next to each side of the medication with frozen gel packs next. This allows the medication to remain at a constant temperature throughout the shipping process. The surrounded medication is then placed in a protective bag for the combination frozen gels and foam pad packouts, or without for combination frozen and unfrozen gels; all packouts are then plac ed in an EPS cooler, which is included in a pre-assembled cardboard box. We currently have five sizes of coolers/cardboard boxes to help ensure the most efficient shipping. Shipping software is used that reads the package destination temperature and determines the shipping method. The system will help ensure that the package is delivered either in a one day or two day mode, depending on multiple factors The following are our guidelines regarding cold packs. SHIPPING GUIDELINES Information is maintained from the drug manufacturers regarding storage and/or shipping requirements of specific drugs. To help ensure drug quality and stability, drugs that have been identified as requiring cold packs are shipped that way to maintain the appropriate medication temperature for the appropriate time FOR PUBLIC USE 85 in transit. Cold packs are generally shipped Monday through Thursday. Exception orders with cold packs can be shipped on Friday. SPECIAL ORDER These are temperature- sensitive items or high- dollar items (medications over $10,000). Shipped by UPS or Express Mail for overnight delivery. PROTECTING FROM HEAT AND FREEZING These are items that require no refrigeration; however, the manufacturer has indicated that they must be protected from extreme heat and freezing. With the exception of temperatures above 85 degrees and below 32 degrees, special packaging is not needed to ship these medications. Shipped delivery signature confirmation is required whenever temperature in the destination city is forecast to be above 85 degrees or below 32 degrees. Otherwise, these products are shipped by priority mail (2-3 day delivery). BENEFITS OF USING THE CURRENT PACKAGING Confidence in packaging and medication temperature integrity across temperature and weather variability experienced across the U.S. on a daily basis. Ease of packing for CVS Caremark staff in our pharmacies as a result of labeling, pre- FOR PUBLIC USE 86 assembled packaging, and color-coded gel packs. Coolers are recyclable in areas where #6 plastics are accepted. FOR PUBLIC USE 87 E12 Are on-site audits performed at mail service pharmacies? If so, describe the frequency and types of audits performed. Will the mail service pharmacy proposed for OGB's mail order program be subjected to the same audit programs as your retail network? Yes, on-site audits a re performed at mail service pharmacies. Quality audits are an integral part of our operations and are conducted by independent business areas, by registered pharmacists with the assistance of our Quality staff. Pharmacy supervisors randomly select orders at any time during the dispensing process and check for appropriate dispensing practices (e.g., quality checks completed by pharmaci sts indicated by an approval stamp, adherence to strict guidelines for filling controlled substances). Operational audits are conducted daily. Pharmacy and pharmacists' licenses, controlled substances inventory and related mandatory documentation, and procedural compliance are audited regularly. Quality assurance staff members observe dispensing operations and interview pharmacy supervisors to monitor compliance with standard operating procedures. Compliance audits are conducted annually. The State Pharma cy Board, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and other regulatory agencies conduct additional external audits. These audits are unannounced and are performed randomly. Designated management and quality assurance staff cooperate with these agencies to co nduct and document the audits. CVS Caremark mail service pharmacies are subject to the same daily claim audits and annual on-site audits as are our retail network pharmacies. E13 Describe the process fo r notifying Plan Participants of the following: a) Expiration date of their prescription For a prescription that i s about to expire or run out of refills, we will notify the member and FOR PUBLIC USE 88 contact the prescriber to obtain a new prescription on behalf of the member. The member has the option to cancel the physician outreach if he or she is no longer taking the medication. b) Next refill date and number of refills remaining Each prescription filled through our mail service will indicate the number of remaining refills and the refill expiration date on the label. Members can also sign up to receive mail order refill reminder me ssages through their message center at Caremark.com or by email. If no refills remain, the reorder form sent with each order will read \"N O REFILLS REMAIN - TIME TO RENEW\". When we receive a ref ill request through mail for a prescription that has no remaining refills, we attempt to reach the prescriber and obtain refill authorization. If we cannot reach the prescriber, we communicate the situation to the member. c) Prescriptions n ot on Formulary Depending on how the benefit design is set up, drugs not on the form ulary will either be rejected by the adjudication system, or alternatives may pay, but generally at a higher copay. For drugs that are not covered, the pharmacy will receive a reject and will send a letter to the member with the information that the drug is not covered. The letter has the Customer Care phone number in case the member would like to discuss it further. If the non-formulary drug is covered, but at a higher copay, then the medication will be filled. If the copay causes the cost of the order to exceed the client-driven threshold, then the member will be contacted to ensur e that they are aware of the charge and also to obtain permission to charge their credit card for the additional cost. FOR PUBLIC USE 89 d) Generic substitution availability If an opportunity for substituting a generic or preferred brand-name drug presents itself, and OGB has opted for our intervention program, our online claims processing system generates a message to the pharmacist. Our clinical intervention and cost-containment program, designed to increase the use of generic and preferred brand drugs, includes online messaging to the pharmacist at the point of service, but not a notif ication directly to the member. E14 5 All (100%) prescriptions dispensed by our Mail Service pharmacies include member counseling information for each prescription. These instructions are specific to both the member and the medication, including information on proper therapy compliance, proper drug usage, possible interactions, side effects, and applicable warnings. Each prescription filled through our mail service will indicate the number of remaining refills and the refill expiration date on the label. Samples of our patient advisory information have been provided. E15 How is the Plan Participant billed (i.e., before or after t h e p r e s c r i p t i o n i s f i l l e d ) ? H o w d o e s t h e P l a n Participant know which co-pay applies? Pre-authorization of funds on a member's credit card takes plac e prior to shipment, however the actual payme nt is processed after filling the prescription . An invoice/receipt is included with every order. We communicate the mail service copay amount to the member as part of the initial program announcemen t. For ongoing support, the member can either call a toll-free telephone number to obtain plan benefit information, which includes copay information, or log on to our mail service website, Caremark.com. Following a brief registration process, the FOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USE 91 F1 Does your organization own a specialty pharmacy? If so, are purchase discounts passed along to the Plan or kept as margin by the PBM? Yes, CVS Caremark and its affiliates own and operate our specialty pharmacy locations. CVS Caremark may receive and retain purchase discounts from drug manufacturers in relation to drugs purchased to stock its mail and specialty pharmacies fo r its entire book of business. Therefore, unlike a PBM that contracts with a third party for mail and specialty fulfillment, CVS Caremark incurs overhead expenses for mail and specialty pharmacy fulfillment not only as a PBM, but as the pharmacy operator as well. It is also important to note that purchase discounts are not directly related to any client's specific member utilization or formulary strategy. F2 Does your organization capture any laboratory data and treatment history at time of enrollment or thereafter? Yes. F3 Do you have the capability to compound medications and to ship these products directly to a medical office? Yes. F4 Confirm that your organization can assist and collaborate with another vendor on all fraud and abuse monitoring, if required. Confirmed.

No. With an open specialty network, any pharmacy that participates in our National Network may be able to dispense specialty drugs. F9 Confirm that your organizat ion will proactively notify OGB of all products that are deem ed specialty. Confirmed. FOR PUBLIC USE 92 F10 Is the proposed specialty pharmacy part of a specialty pharmacy network? Provide the locations of the other specialty pharmacies in the network. A list of our specialty pharmacy locations has been provided. F11 Does your organization offer an integrated specialty pharmacy program? If yes, describe the operations of the program and include elements describing Plan Participant outreach, case and care management abilities. Yes. We approach the management of cost, quality and outcomes in a way that is unmatched in the industry. Our specialty pharmacy CareTeams manage all patients on a regular basis to help manage side effects and ensure adherence to their prescribed medication. We see an opportunity for a more holistic approach to management of the most complex - high cost patients. This holistic approach encompasses management of co-morbidities, self-care and other issues that are related to the patient's conditions, not just their medications. Our AccordantCare care management program offers members with rare conditions nurse support with a holistic view, in addition to medication management services through our specialty pharmacy. For rare conditions, our AccordantCare nurses ar e integrated with our specialty solutions to support members in managing their whole condition and co- morbidities, especially in critical disease states. We provide clinical care focused on the member and the condition vs. the drug dispensed and thus have the ability to reduce total health care costs and improve quality of life. Members benefit from an integrated specialty pharmacist and nurse experience, which result in timely and coordinated clinical interventions and lead to improved medication and care plan adherence. We are the only specialty pharmacy to provide a truly comprehensive solution by integrating, nurse-led care management for rare, complex FOR PUBLIC USE 93 conditions with our specialty pharmacy services. F12 Describe the status, scope, and management strategies of your specialty pharmacy services in the following areas: a) Injectable and infusion therapies As one of the leading specialty and infusion providers, we provide and support infusion therapy in both the home and the ambulatory care settings. We support those medications that are considered specialty therapies such as hemophilia, intravenous immune globulins, enzyme replacement therapies (Cerezyme, Fabrazyme etc.), pulmo nary hypertension, and other infused medications for example, the treatment of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, we have the ability to support the full spectrum of home infusion therapies such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), intravenous antibiotics, hydration, and pain management. FOR PUBLIC USE 94 b) High-cost ($5,000 per year and up) therapies CVS Caremark offers a range of proven cost containment solutions to better manage the unsustainable rising costs in the specialty market while preserving clinical quality and patient needs and maintaining access to limited distribution drugs. Due to the high cost of specialty drugs across classes and disease states, we recommend comprehensive specialty management strategies, some of which include the following to help manage specialty trend. Targeted formulary strategies including indication- and outcome s- based contracting Copay plan solutions to help minimize the impact of specialty copay cards Innovative plan desi gns including tiered and cost-effectiveness, complemented by our partnership with the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) to establish the estimated expenditure p er unit benefit for new drugs at or just before the time of their introduction to the market. CVS Caremark has developed this approach to meet the needs of our clients, and we are the first PBM and managed care organization to make a direct attempt to address the l aunch price problem. We believe this Cost-Effectiveness Plan Design will have a tangible and demonstrable impact on drug launch prices, leading to a more sustainable and affordable drug benefit that delivers higher value to clients and their members. Site of care optimization with Coram\u00ae* infusion care. Our Site of Care Alignment offering is specifically focused on clinician- infused medications that are primarily administered, billed, and paid for under the medical benefit. The program targets a select list of medications that may be appropriate to be administered at a lower cost site of care. FOR PUBLIC USE 95 c) Therapies that require complex care Specialty members relying on complex medications require personalized care and support to help ensure t hey are on the right drug, at the right dose, and are using and responding to their medications appropriately in order to achieve optimal therapeutic benefit. By focusing only on a lim ited range of conditions and a much narrower segment of the population, we have dev eloped a significant level of clinical experti se and knowledge.

F14 Does your organization offer any of the following programs? a) Package recovery program Yes. b) Vial/assay management program Yes. c) Ready to inject program Yes. FOR PUBLIC USE 99 F15 How do you monitor and report on compliance and adherence to therapy? We monitor adherence for each specialty member on an ongoing basis. Annually, as well as at any time upon client request, we are able to provide therapy-specific, client-level adherence, calculated as Medication Possession Ratio (MPR). Adherence information can also be provided at a member- specific level upon the client's request. We employ the following specific methodology: Adherence is measured as a member's MPR: -Includes both new and existing utilizers in the drug class -Analysis period is generally a calendar year or 12 months -Total adherence for members with multiple conditions can be calculated as a weighted average of the adherences by drug class. MPR is: -Defined as (total days' supply of medication received by the member/total days' exposure to therapy) -The MPR analysis period will be based on a 12-month period measured from the effective date and every contract year thereafter during the initial term -MPR will be greater than zero but cannot exceed a value of one -Days' exposure is evaluated from the member's first fill date in the 12-month analysis period to either the end of the period or until the member discontin ues therapy. When a member's last fill has a days' supply that goes beyond the end of the analysis period, only the days' supply that falls within the time period should be counted. PERSISTENCY FOR PUBLIC USE 100 Persistency is measur ed as a new utilizers length of therapy within the initial 12 months of service, or an alternate timeframe based on condition: Includes only new utiliz ers in the drug class Analysis period is generally a calendar year or 12 months Persistency is: -Defined as: (total days elapsed in the measurement period that the utilizer was considered to be on medication) -The Persistency analysis period will be based on a 12-month period measured from the effective date and ev ery contract year thereafter during the initial term -Any utilizer that has a gap within dispensed medication that exceeds 60 days is considered no longer on service or no longer persistent -Days' elapsed is evaluated from the member's first fill date in the identification period to when the member discontinues therapy within the measurement period. F16 How do you report on Plan Participant outcomes for specialty drug management programs (i.e., return on investment, clinic al results, etc.)? The answer provided in response to this question contains confidential information that is proprietary to, and constitutes trade secrets of, CVS Caremark. CVS Caremark's trade secret and/or proprietary information is exempt from disclosure under applicable public records laws. All plan participant outcomes are measured and reported via our web-based RxNavigator reporting tool. CVS Caremark can also provide access of our RxNavigator reporting tool to OGB for . F17 How will new specialty products (not known today) be priced? Please provide a minimum guarantee for newly-released drugs added to the specialty list. Specialty products will be provided a separate guaranteed discount fo r new to market specialty drugs. FOR PUBLIC USE 101 F18 Confirm that only new ly-released drugs will be added to the specialty list. (i.e., you cannot flip drugs that are non-specialty t oday to specialty status later.) Confirmed. F19 Confirm that OGB will have the ability to negotiate the addition of new specialty drugs to the list and the associated minimum discount offered. If agreement on price cannot be reached, confirm that OGB may carve out such products without any financial or other penalty. Confirmed. F20 For products to which you do not have access, please describe the process for the Plan Participant to obtain these drugs. Should we receive a prescription in our specialty pharmacy for an item we do not dispense, we will return the prescription to the prescriber and advise the prescriber of the specialty pharmacies with access to dispense the medication. F21 Please confirm HIV/AIDS medications are not included on the specialty list and that they would be subject to standard retail network and mail order pricing. Confirmed. F22 Do you currently receive incentives from pharmaceutical manufacturers for any programs or services associated with your specialty program (i.e., data fees, compliance programs, etc.)? Are these incentives included in your definition of total rebates? We may receive fees from certain manufacturers for clinical services that our specialty pharmacies provide to the manufacturer for compliance and persistency programs. These fees are based on our specialty pharmacy book-of-business, and are not tied to a specific c lient's utilization, therefore, this revenue is not included in our definition of total rebates. F23 Do you provide rebates for products dispensed under the medical benefit (i.e., certain medications dispensed during a hospital stay, specific injectable medications, etc.)? At this time, we do no t provide rebates for products dispensed under the medical benefit. However, we would be happy to work with OGB, and your medical carriers (e.g. BCBS Louisiana), to determine which medications can be carved out to the PBM to maximize savings. F24 How would you notify OGB of new drug rebating developments? The pace of change in health care demands that we continue to innovate and find differentiated solutions to deliver on our commitment to driving more affordable, FOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USE 103 G3 What percentage of the proposed network is made up of independent pharmacies versus major chains? 40% G4 List the elements of your various pharmacy audit programs. For each program, include the type of audit, frequency, and audit method. Our pharmacy audit process involves both on- site and off-site procedures: On-site procedures are designed to verify the accuracy of claims submitted through observation of original records including, among other things, prescription hard copies and patient signature lo gs. On-site auditors provide education to the pharmacy staff on CVS Caremark initiat ives and proper billing methods. The on-site process also includes a review of the pharmacy for adherence to other contractual requirements, such as reviewing pharmacy computer DUR/Medication allergy screening, drug stock reviews, partial and return-to-stock procedures, compliance with Medicare Part D requirements, and more. Off-site procedures include both Investigational and Desk audits. Investigational audits are based on utilization and cost data obtained from reports designed to identify erroneous billings. An investigational audit is a close scrutiny of pharmacy records that may include its purchases, documentation of records, and confirmation of prescripti ons from prescribers. All participating pharmacies are subject to our Desk Audit process, which audits for erroneous billings including four off-site teams\u2014Daily Review, Compound Review, Medicare Part D, and member submitted Paper Claims Review. Each team has processes to confirm that claims are properly submitted by the pharmacy or member. DAILY REVIEW AND COMPOUND REVIEW PROCESSES FOR PUBLIC USE 104 Pharmacy Performance performs a daily review of high dollar claims as well as claims submitted with abnormal quantities or dosages. The daily review is des igned to supplement the system edit processes and focuses on the reasonableness of quantity and dosage form. Keying issues are usually the source of incorrect quantity, days' supply, dosage form, or NDC numbers. When an e rror is suspected, a telephone call is placed to the pharmacy. Most reversals occur within one cycle before the plan sponsor pays the claim, with the remainder adjusted ou t of cycle. Pharmacies that have recurring or sub stantial billing issues are more likely to be selected for an on-site audit. The same high dollar review is performed for compound medication claims. This review helps to ensure that compound claims are paid per the contracted rates and meet the plan design requirements of the plan sponsor. RETROSPECTIVE AUDITS We are committed to identifying and eliminating drug diversion and insurance fraud. Our retrospective audit analysis, including on- site audit and investigational audits, helps identify and eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse. ON-SITE AUDIT PROCESS In addition to the auditing and monitoring techniques discussed above, our Pharmacy Performance team conducts more than 4,000 on-site pharmacy audits annually. FOR PUBLIC USE 105 Our on-site auditing process uses a proprietary program that performs a systematic review of the claims history and automatically flags claims meeting specific criteria. The entire claim record, as transmitted by the pharmacy and subsequently adjudi cated by us, is made available at the audit site allowing the auditor to deviate from the original audit plan as the situation dictates. The audit function is also educational. Auditors answer questions about CVS Caremark, inform pharmacists about our programs and policies, and relay pharmacists' concerns back to us. Educational material is provided to all pharmacies to assist in improved program performance and to prevent future point-of-service and submission issues. Approximately two wee ks after an on-site or investigational audit is completed the pharmacy is sent a report listing the audit discrepancies and guidelines for documenting these discrepancie s. The pharmacy is required to respond, in writing, with proper verification and documentation to support the claims in question. Our on-site auditing process includes a systematic review of the pharmacy's claims history. Specific claims to be reviewed are selected by algorithms, which identify claims that meet specific criter ia. Claims may also be selected subjectively by the auditor for any number of reasons including the presence of unusual trends. INVESTIGATIONAL AUDITS Pharmacies may be selected for an FOR PUBLIC USE 106 investigational audi t if the Pharmacy Performance department's analysis indicates irregularities, whether upon receipt of a client referral, upon receipt of a tip from a regulatory agency, member/enrollee, provider/client, or whether from cases referred from other audit processes. The CVS Health Pharmacy Performance management team then determines which of the following actions may be appropriate: Review of purchase invoices Contacting the prescriber-of-record for validation Contacting the patient fo r validation of receipt of medications. G5 How will audit recoveries be paid or remitted to OGB? OGB will receive 100% o f audit recoveries. These collected funds will be returned to OGB as a credit on your invoice or through the correction of the claim transaction. FOR PUBLIC USE 107 G6 Provide a copy of your survey questionnaire, documentation of the survey methodology, and the results of the most recent network pharmacy satisfaction survey. We measure satisfaction via telephone surveys with members, clients, and pharmacists. Each group is measured in a tailored way: Members \u2014 Members who have utilized their retail and/or mail benefits, or have used our specialty pharmacy, or if they have contacted one of our Customer Care units, are selected randomly to participa te in a brief survey designed to evaluate their service experiences. This research, conducted continuously, is an important management tool that helps us assess the quality of our performance and stay abreast of member needs and problems. Clients \u2014 Client exe cutives are asked to participate in satisfaction surveys designed to assess performance in a number of key service areas. These surveys enable us to identify how well client expectations are being met, track the effectiveness of continuous quality improvement programs, and assist in identifying best-performing Account Services personnel. Pharmacists \u2014 Pharmacists who recently have contacted our Pharmacy Help Desk are surveyed randomly to ass ess their satisfaction with our services. This research reflects our commitment to help our retail-network pharmacies provide prompt, accurate service to prescription drug members. Studies are also conducted by qualified professional research firms that specialize in customer satisfaction issues. These firms notify respondents that they are conducting the studies on behalf of CVS Caremark. MEMBER SATISFACTION RESULTS FOR FOR PUBLIC USE 108 CAREMARK We randomly select members who have recently used their prescription drug benefits or contacted our Customer Care department, and ask them to participa te in a brief survey designed to evaluate their service experience/s. This research is performed on an ongoing basis and is an important management tool for helping to ensure that we are aligned with our members' needs. In 2019, our member overall satisfaction was rated as 95% Satisfied or better. PHARMACIST SATISFACTION RESULTS Pharmacists who recent ly have contacted our Pharmacy Help Desk are surveyed randomly to assess their satisfaction with our services. This research reflects our commitment to assisting retail network pharmacies in providing prompt, accurate service to prescription drug members. In 2019, 96% of responding pharmacists in our contracted networks were satisfied overall with our Help Desk support service G7 How many contracted pharmacies were terminated during the final six months of 2019 because of unacceptable audit or performance results? Explain specific reason(s) for termination of each such pharmacy. 49 pharmacies were termed in the final six months of 2019 for audit results, none of which were in the State of Louisiana. G8 How often are pharmacies paid (i.e., weekly, bi- weekly, monthly, etc.)? Payments are issued to pharmacies on a weekly basis as claims become due for payment. FOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USE 110 H3 Does your organization offer a self-funded EGWP? Yes H4 Do you support custom benefit designs and Formularies within the scope of CMS regulations for EGWP clients? Yes H5 Describe your process for managing Part D versus Part B drugs within the EGWP administration process We provide appropriate Part B vs. Part D assistance at the point of service (POS). CMS requires plans to implement strategies that promptly provide members access to appropriate pharmacy care. Plans are expected to process B vs. D drug coverage decisions without delay, preferably at the POS. A timely and systematic approach is needed to monitor and apply changing coverage rules to avoid member disruption, CMS complaints, and negative CMS audit findings. This enhanced solution offers c lients an alternative to managing these processes in-house, which can often be a costly, and also helps to minimize beneficiary disruption by speeding access to care. Should a client want to cover a drug that is deemed to be a Part B drug after the determination proce ss, we can ensure that drug is covered on our enhanced benefit which will eliminate member noise significantly. H6 Is your organization able to submit enrollment data and cost files directly to C MS on behalf of OGB? Yes H7 If yes to the above, what is the frequency with which your organization submits enrollment data and cost files directly to CMS and the timing for these to go into effect? CVS Caremark's affiliate, SilverScript Insurance Company (\"SilverScript\") follows CMS guidelines for enrollment. Our process is described as follows: - Receive a client batch files with new adds, changes, and disenrollments via secure connection. - Enrollment and disenrollment requests are expected to contain required data elements for successful processing. - Enrollment requests are expected to be received 45 days prior to effective date of coverage. - Process group sponsor Medicare Part D FOR PUBLIC USE 111 batch files Opt-Out Option - Member will be on hold for 30 days (21 days plus ma iling) before releasing the transaction to CMS. Opt-In Option - Transaction will be released to CMS without a 30-day hold. H8 Please explain your process used for low income subsidies and catastrophic coverage. During the enrollment process, CMS notifies SilverScript of any Low Income Subsidy (LIS) eligibility. We use this i nformation to properly mark the individual for the appropriate level of Low Income Copay Subsidy (LICS) and the Low Income Premium Subsidy (LIPS). Per CMS guidance, LIPS should be used to offset any premium owed by the beneficiary. For a self funded EGWP plan, you will be paid back the LIPS monthly and are required to reimburse eligible members within 45 days of the date SilverScript r eceives the payment from CMS, which is typically the first day of the benefit month. SilverScript will identify LIPS members within the monthly subsidy report. CMS pays reinsurance subsidies on a PMPM (per member per month) basis. For a Self-Funded EGWP plan the PMPM reinsurance subsidies will be reconciled to actual incurred reinsurance costs as part of the annual reconciliation process for the plan year. In the event that your reinsurance subsidies exceed the actual incurred reinsurance amount calculated during annual reconciliation, the difference will be recouped by SilverScript. In the event that your reinsurance subsidies are less than the actual incurred reinsurance amount, the difference will be paid to you within 30 days. H9 Does your organizatio n have the capability to segregate Med-D eligible and non Med-D eligible retirees? Yes H10 Will your organization pet ition CMS for OGB-specific waivers? Yes H11 Confirm that separate re porting and billing will be provided for the EGWP-PDP group. Confirmed H12 When would a decision need to be made, in order to be enrolled into the upcoming (2021) EGWP wrap plan year? SilverScript's recommendation for a smooth and effective transition to the PDP is 150 days from initial kick-off m eeting to the \"go-live\" date. For a January 1 plan effective date, a final decision should be made by late July (or early August at the latest) of the prior year to help ensure optimal timing for implementation planning. FOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USE 113 I3 Will you allow a customized insert be included in the initial CMS requir ed mailings (eg Opt out mailing and Welcome kit) Yes I4 Describe the training you provide to OGB's staff who could take calls from Medicare retired members. Client education on the administration of EGWP plans is a key focus of SilverScript's implementation process. Our trainings cover subjects such as enrollment/disenrollment, late enrollment penalty, creditable coverage, low income subsidy, EGWP-related subsidies, income related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA), member communication materials, and EGWP reporting. SilverScript can provide EGWP training to OGB staff that interact with Medicare Part D members through onsite and/or live meeting pr esentations. We are happy to further discuss OGB's training needs and preferences. I5 Describe any clinical p rograms over and above the minimum CMS requirements. Please provide detailed information on ea ch one, including cost, if any. List of Recommended Clinical programs and costs provided. I6 Will you allow OGB to remov e prior authorizations, quantity limits or step therapies on an individual drug or therapy class level? Yes I7 Do you allow clients to elect to cover non-Part D drugs? Yes I8 Do you allow clients to e lect to cover non-formulary drugs? Yes I9 If you do allow clients to elect to cover non- formulary drug, please confirm the process can be customized to allow a prior authorization exceptions process if requested. We can accomplish this through our enhanced drug coverage program. I10 Are you able to administer a supplemental wrap using a single transaction coordination of benefits through one identification card? Yes I11 Please provide an example of how straddle claims are calculated. Below is a description of our standard straddle claim logic for Medicare Part D: If the claim is cusping from a benefit phase with a fixed (flat) copay into a benefit phase For example, an EGWP plan has a fixed copay of $25 for applicable brands in both the ICL and Gap phase, and the CMS Defined Standard catastrophic cost share FOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USE 115 Discount Network with nearly 68,000 providers nationally, including all national and regional chains and most independents. Approximately 24,000 of those providers are Preferred Discount Network preferred pharmacies. J2 Do you currently offer a preferred pharmacy network for your Medicare business? If yes, please provide specifics: Yes SilverScript offers a preferred Medicare Part D retail network with greater overall discounts. Our Medicare Part D Preferred Discount Network is a network option that provides a balance between member access and the opportunity for additional client savings. The Preferred Discount Network includes nearly 68,000 providers nationally, including all national and regional chains and most independents. Approximately 24,000 of those providers are Preferred Discount Network preferred pharmacies. The Preferred Discount Network and the pricing afforded by SilverScript due to OGB's election of the network is expressly conditioned upon a sufficient copay differential between a preferred pharmacy and nonpreferred pharmacy. Savings FOR PUBLIC USE 116 realized with the Preferred Discount Network can translate to lower premiums, lower deductibles, and lower copays. J3 Please provide your in and out of network paper claims process. How d o you determine an emergency? The following is our claims processing workflow: The claim is mailed to our P.O. Box address. The mail is picked up and delivered to the Paper Claims department. The mail is opened, sorted, counted, and scanned. All work is date-stamped. Processors work their claims by oldest date received. Claims adjudicate against the client benefit for paper claims (e.g., foreign claims, COB, Medicare Part D) Some claims require that a return letter be sent to the member asking for more information. Quality Control audits claims through MedForce (imaging tool). Errors are returned to the claims processor s for corrective action and adjustment (if needed). Quality Control is a separate depar tment from Claims Processing. Upon completion of sca nning, the clerk picks up and stores the claims on site for approximately 30 days. Claims are forwarded to a third-party off-site After 10 years, claims are destroyed by on-site shredding at the storage facility ; this process is overseen by SilverScript Claims department management. Upon claims adjudication, files are downloaded on a routine basis to a third-party vendor. The third-party vendor produces the Paper Claims Reconciliation Statements (PCRS) and checks. Claims run nightly. In emergencies, the member will already have their medication, so the Out of Network claim is reviewed as all other claims. Our Customer Care team will work with the member in a reasonable manner to determine and accommodate for emergency situations which would allow us to process the claim as Out of Network. FOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USEFOR PUBLIC USE 119 M2 Please provide Contractor eligibility file layout requirements. What customization is allowed? The following elements are CMS-required information for all members being enrolled into the EGWP plan (retiree s and spouses will need to be listed separately), along with providing the completed production file to SilverScript for the initial enrollment period. The file should be provided in the DM46 file format, and each record must include the following information for successful intake: Name DOB Gender Primary address Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) Plan hierarchy information Effective date Term date Disenrollment reason codes Notice date Other than these CMS-required items, SilverScript has the flexibility to include other elements that are important to OGB. M3 What is Contractor's resolution process for handling eligibility outliers? We manage rejects in work queues to correct and resubmit eligible transactions to CMS for resolution, and we wo rk closely with the account team on exceptions or questions that may be outside of our view. SilverScript follows CMS guidelines for enrollment and disenrollment. When a transaction reply repor t (TRR) is received, an Exceptions team repres entative works on the data discrepancies between the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MARx) application and Part D enrollment system as follows: If the MARx applicat ion shows the same member and the enrollment system shows the last name and first name reversed, incorrect FOR PUBLIC USE 120 date of birth, or gender mismatch, the representative will update the transaction and resubmit it to CMS. If a reject cannot be resolved by inquiry to the enrollment system or we are unable to contact the member, our Part D Services team triggers a letter to the member seeking additional information and notifies the corresponding Account Manager.

Some of these factors include: Safety relative to other drugs with the same indication(s) and therapeutic action(s) Efficacy relative to other drugs with the same FDA-approved indication(s) Available dosage forms of the drug and the dosing interval for each approved indication. New products must meet all drug admission criteria to be considered for addition to our formulary. P9 Contractor confirms that committee(s)/team(s) involved in developing and managing your formulary (ies) do NOT utilize cost information Yes FOR PUBLIC USE 126 when determining whether the medication offers an clinically significant advantage that should provide it \"preferred\" status. P10 What are the criteria for evaluating an existing drug's formulary status? We utilize peer-reviewed literature; recognized compendia; consensus documents; nationally sanctioned guidelines and other publications of the National Institutes of Health, Agency for Healthcare Research an d Quality, and other organizations or government agencies; drug labeling approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); and input from medical specialty practitioners . Market factors (i.e., upcoming generic launches , current utilization among drugs within a given therapeutic category) may also impact the drug selection process. P11 What are the criteria for adding a drug to your formulary? Criteria used for adding a drug to the formulary is a based on CMS requirements and includes ensuring drugs meet the definition of a Medicare Part D eligible drug. Each drug class or category must incl ude coverage of at least two drugs and that all or substantially all of the Protected Class drugs are covered on the formulary. P12 What are the criteria for deleting single-source brand drugs from your Part-D formulary? Except in limited circumstances, such as removal from the market, new clinical guidelines, safety concerns, or a change in Medicare Part D eligibility, single-source brand drugs are generally no t deleted during the plan year. P13 When a brand medication loses its patent protection, Contractor confirms that it is moved to \"non-preferred\" brand status when generics become available. In almost all cases and subject to all CMS requirements, brand medications are either removed from the formulary or moved to non- preferred brand status when a new generic becomes available and is added to the formulary. P14 When a brand medication loses its patent protection, Contractor confirm that relevant step therapy programs are revisited and OGB is Utilization management cri teria developed by CVS Caremark for SilverScript are reviewed by external physicians and pharmacists and FOR PUBLIC USE 127 provided the option to mak e the generic available as a step one medication. approved by CMS as needed. We will work closely with you to determine if any current edits could be applied to the enhanced benefit. P15 Do you allow clients the option to delay single- source brand deletions from the Part-D formulary until the next plan year? Except in limited circumstances, such as removal from the market, new clinical guidelines, safety concerns, or a change in Medicare Part D eligibility, single-source brand drugs are generally no t deleted during the plan year. However, if these drugs are deleted from the Part-D formulary, they still may be available for coverage on the open enhanced benefit during the plan year and can be assessed for deletion from the enha nced benefit the next plan year. P16 How do you communicate formulary changes to your clients and their members outside of the CMS required notice? Abridged formularies are provided to all members as part of their welcome kit materials and annually in the Annual Notice of Change (ANOC) mailing. Comprehensive formularies are available by r equest for members. Members also have access to their drug coverage through tools that are available on caremark.com. For our template SilverSc ript formularies, our practice is to make negative formulary changes, whereby brands are replaced by generics, twice a year, u sually on June 1 and September 1. Changes are also made as needed for market withdrawals such as manufacturer discontinuations or FDA product safety withdrawals. Midyear negative formulary changes require a 30-day advance notice to impacted members, except for immediate gene ric substitution (i.e., removal or change in the tier/cost sharing of a brand name drug on the formulary when substituting a new therapeutically equivalent generic drug) and removal of drugs withdrawn FOR PUBLIC USE 128 from the market, where notification could be retrospective. P17 Contractor can communica te formulary tier-status changes to OGB at least 60 days prior to changes being made. CVS Caremark, through its affiliate, SilverScript, agrees to communicate EGWP and/or enhanced benefit fo rmulary changes to OGB between 30-60 days in accordance with CMS rules & guidelines and enhanced benefit formulary timelines. P18 Contractor can communicate the impact of formulary tier-status changes (member impact and costs/savings) to OGB at least 60 days prior to changes being made. CVS Health, through its affiliate SilverScript, agrees to communicate EGWP and/or enhanced benefit formulary changes to OGB between 30-60 days in a ccordance with CMS rules & guidelines and enhanced benefit formulary timelines and will include member impact information as well. P19 What percentage of your formulary consists of multi-source brand drugs? Multi-source brand drugs make up approximately 21% of the drugs covered on 2020 SilverScript Copper Formulary (eff 4/1/2020). P20 What percentage of your formulary are extended release versions of medications? Approximately 16% of the drugs covered on the 2020 SilverScript Copper formulary are extended release formulations.

FOR PUBLIC USE A 10181 Scripps Gateway Ct, San Diego, CA 92131 P 800.788.2949 MedImpact.com September 15, 2020 To Chairman White: We are writing in relation to Item No. 8A on the JLCB meeting agenda for the Friday, September 18 meeting, the proposed Pharmacy Benefits Manager (\"PBM\") emergency contract that the Office of Group Benefits (\"OGB\") and the Division of Administration \"DOA\") are pursuing. As you may be aware this same emergency contract was brought before the OGB Policy and Planning Board at its September 9 meeting, where the Board refused to recommend approval of the contract by a vote of 5- 3. Prior to the meeting, the Commi ssioner of Administration wrote to the OGB Board members informing them that a recommendation by that board in support of the contract was required before it could be brought before the JLCB. That communication is attached to this letter. Despite this, OGB and DOA are bringing the emergency contract before the JLCB at the Friday meeting. The purpose of this letter is to inform the JLCB that MedImpact has made a formal offer to OGB to extend its current contract for a one- year period at the pricing and pri cing terms contained in the proposed emergency contract that is on the JLCB agenda. The offer that was submitted to OGB also is attached to this letter. This MedImpact offer would ensure that there will be no disruption of services that would come with a c hange in vendors under the proposed emergency contract, while the state would receive the same pricing and pricing terms of the emergency contract and therefore realize the exact same cost savings. Thank you for your time and consideration of this offer from MedImpact. We look forward to the opportunity to discuss this more fully at the JLCB meeting on Friday. Sincerely, Dale R.
