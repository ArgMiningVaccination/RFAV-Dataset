There is no single, widely-agreed definition of spirituality. Many people gravitate toward spirituality to seek religious-like understandings without the ideological constraints of institutional religion. This community, however, is open to everyone, religious and non-religious alike. Join us in finding our place in the universe. Pointing the finger, blaming people for the emotionally unsatisfying relationships they have been \"attracting\". I get the mirroring energy to a point. But some of us have never known true love. Some of us have been neglected and abused our whole life. Yes you can manifest or attract people based off unhealed wounds, however: Some of us actually need someone to love the wounded us, show us what real love is and accept us before we can heal. When someone breaks their leg, they need crutches and a cast. We don't point the finger, telling them they need to magically heal within and then the crutches will find them. They need crutches first, to be able to stand again. When a kitten is abandoned on the road, they need someone to feed them, give them water, take them in. \"The things outside your control are your responsibility to heal from\". Just stop. Some of us literally can't provide for ourselves what external love would. Some of us don't have the emotional resources to heal on our own and just some external proof that love actually exists. Just like telling someone stranded on an island with no water, \"Manifest pure, drinkable, water out of fucking nowhere and you'll be fine\" \"And if not, it's your fucking fault you'll die of thirst\". What a load of shit. "}
